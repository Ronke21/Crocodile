<text>Rākshasa (, , ; ; &quot;preservers&quot;) are a race of usually malevolent beings prominently featured in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Folk Islam. They reside on Earth but possess supernatural powers, which they usually use for evil acts such as disrupting Vedic sacrifices or eating humans.

The term is also used to describe asuras, a class of power-seeking beings that oppose the benevolent devas. They are often depicted as antagonists in Hindu scriptures, as well as in Buddhism and Jainism. The female form of rakshasa is rakshasi().

==Hinduism==
=== In Puranas ===
Brahmā, in a form composed of the quality of foulness, produced hunger, of whom anger was born: and the god put forth in darkness beings emaciate with hunger, of hideous aspects, and with long beards. Those beings hastened to the deity. Such of them as exclaimed, “Oh preserve us!” were thence called Rākṣasas. Those created beings, overwhelmed by hunger, attempted to seize the waters. Those among them who said—“we shall protect these waters”, are remembered as Rākṣasas.

===Description===
Rakshasas were most often depicted as shape-shifting, fierce-looking, enormous monstrous-looking creatures, with two fangs protruding from the top of the mouth and having sharp, claw-like fingernails. They were shown as being mean, growling beasts, and as insatiable man-eaters that could smell the scent of human flesh. Some of the more ferocious ones were shown with flaming red eyes and hair, drinking blood with their cupped hands or from human skulls (similar to representations of vampires in later Western mythology). Generally they could fly, vanish, and had &quot;maya&quot; (magical powers of illusion), which enabled them to change size at will and assume the form of any creature. 

=== In Hindu epics ===
In the world of the Ramayana and Mahabharata, Rakshasas were a populous race. There were both good and evil rakshasas, and as warriors they fought alongside the armies of both good and evil. They were powerful warriors, expert magicians and illusionists. As shape-changers, they could assume different physical forms. As illusionists, they were capable of creating appearances which were real to those who believed in them or who failed to dispel them. Some of the rakshasas were said to be man-eaters, and made their gleeful appearance when the slaughter on a battlefield was at its worst. Occasionally they served as rank-and-file soldiers in the service of one or another warlord.

Aside from their treatment of unnamed rank-and-file Rakshasas, the epics tell the stories of certain members of these beings who rose to prominence, sometimes as heroes but more often as villains.

Thapar suggests that the Rakshasas could represent exaggerated, supernatural depictions of demonized forest-dwellers who were outside the caste society.

==== In the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; ====
In books 3-6 of the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;, the rākṣasas are the main antagonists of the narrative. The protagonist Rāma slays many rākṣasas throughout the epic, including Tāṭakā, Mārīca, and Rāvaṇa. In the epic, the rākṣasas are portrayed as mainly demonic beings who are aggressive and sexual. They can assume any form they wish, which Rāvaṇa uses to good effect to trick and kidnap Sītā, Rāma&#x27;s wife, which drives the rest of the narrative. The rākṣasas reside in the forests south of the Gangetic plain and in the island fortress of Laṅkā, both far away from the lands of Kosala and the home of Rāma. In Laṅkā, the capital of Rāvaṇa, the rākṣasas live in a complex society comparable to the humans of Ayodhyā, where some rākṣasas such as Vibhīṣaṇa are moral beings.

====In the Mahabharata====
The Pandava hero Bhima was the nemesis of forest-dwelling Rakshasas who dined on human travellers and terrorized human settlements.
* Bhima killed Hidimba, a cannibal Rakshasa. The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; describes him as a cruel cannibal with sharp, long teeth and prodigious strength. When Hidimba saw the Pandavas sleeping in his forest, he decided to eat them. He sent his sister Hidimbi to reconnoiter the situation, and the young woman fell in love with the handsome Bhima, whom she warned of danger. Infuriated, Hidimba declared he was ready to kill not only the Pandavas but also his sister, but he was thwarted by the heroism of Bhima, who defeated and killed him in a duel.
* Ghatotkacha, a Rakshasa who fought on the side of the Pandavas, was the son of Bhima and the Rakshasi Hidimbi, who had fallen in love with the hero and warned him of danger from her brother. Bhima killed the evil Rakshasa Hidimba. Their son&#x27;s name refers to his round bald head; &quot;ghata&quot; means &#x27;pot&#x27; and &quot;utkacha&quot; means &#x27;head&#x27; in Sanskrit. Ghatotkacha is considered a loyal and humble figure. He and his followers were available to his father Bhima at any time; all Bhima had to do was to think of him and he would appear. Like his father, Ghatotkacha primarily fought with the mace. His wife was Ahilawati and his sons were Anjanaparvana, Barbarika, and Meghavarna.

In the &quot;Mahabharata,&quot; Ghatotkacha was summoned by Bhima to fight on the Pandava side in the Kurukshetra War. Invoking his magical powers, he wrought great havoc in the Kaurava army. In particular, after the death of Jayadratha, when the battle continued on past sunset, his powers were at their most effective (at night). After performing many heroic deeds on the battlefield and fighting numerous duels with other great warriors (including the Rakshasa Alamvusha, the elephant-riding King Bhagadatta, and Aswatthaman, the son of Drona), Ghatotkacha encountered the human hero Karna. At this point in the battle, the Kaurava leader Duryodhana had appealed to his best fighter, Karna, to kill Ghatotkacha, as the entire Kaurava army was near annihilation due to his ceaseless strikes from the air. Karna possessed a divine weapon, Shakti, granted by the god Indra. It could be used only once and Karna had been saving it to use on his arch-enemy Arjuna, the best Pandava fighter. Unable to refuse Duryodhana, Karna used the Shakti against Ghatotkacha, killing him. This is considered to be the turning point of the war. After his death, the Pandava counselor Krishna smiled, as he considered the Pandava prince Arjuna to be saved from certain death, as Karna had used the &quot;Shakta&quot; divine weapon. A temple in Manali, Himachal Pradesh, honors Ghatotkacha; it is located near the Hidimba Devi Temple.
*Bakasura was a cannibalistic forest-dwelling Rakshasa who terrorized the nearby human population by forcing them to take turns making him regular deliveries of food, including human victims. The Pandavas travelled into the area and took up residence with a local Brahmin family. Their turn came when they had to make a delivery to Bakasura, and they debated who among them should be sacrificed. The rugged Bhima volunteered to take care of the matter. Bhima went into the forest with the food delivery (consuming it on the way to annoy Bakasura). He engaged Bakasura in a ferocious wrestling match, and broke his back. The human townspeople were amazed and grateful. The local Rakshasas begged for mercy, which Bhima granted them on the condition that they give up cannibalism. The Rakshasas agreed and soon acquired a reputation for being peaceful towards humans.
*Kirmira, the brother of Bakasura, was a cannibal and master illusionist. He haunted the wood of Kamyaka, dining on human travellers. Like his brother before him, Kirmira also made the mistake of fighting the Pandav hero Bhima, who killed him with his bare hands.
*Jatasura was a cunning Rakshasa who, disguised as a Brahmin, attempted to steal the Pandavas&#x27; weapons and to ravish Draupadi, wife of the five Pandavas. Bhima arrived in time to intervene, and killed Jatasur in a duel. Jatasur&#x27;s son was Alamvush, who fought on the side of the Kauravas at Kurukshetra.

Rakshasa heroes fought on both sides in the Kurukshetra war.
* Alamvusha was a Rakshasa skilled at fighting with both conventional weapons and the powers of illusion. According to the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, he fought on the side of the Kauravas. Arjuna defeated him in a duel, as did Arjuna&#x27;s son Abhimanyu. But Alamvusha in turn killed Iravan, Arjuna&#x27;s son by a Nāga princess Ulupi, when the Rakshasa used his powers of illusion to take on the form of Garuda. Alamvusha was also defeated by Bhima. He was slain by Bhima&#x27;s son, the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha.

==Buddhism==
Many Rakshasas appear in various Buddhist Scriptures. In Chinese tradition rakshasa are known as &quot;luosha&quot; (/). In Japan, they are known as &quot;rasetsu&quot; ().

Chapter 26 of the Lotus Sutra includes a dialogue between the Buddha and a group of rakshasa daughters, who swear to uphold and protect the Lotus Sutra. They also teach magical dhāraṇīs to protect followers who also uphold the sutra.

Five rakshasha are part of Mahakala&#x27;s retinue. They are Kala and Kali, husband and wife, and their offspring Putra, Bhatri and Bharya.

The Lankavatara Sutra mentions the island of Sri Lanka as land of Rakshasas. Their king is the Rakshasa called Ravana, who invites Buddha to Sri Lanka for delivering the sermon in the land. There are other Rakhasas from the land, such as Wibisana, who is believed to be the brother of Ravana in Sri Lankan Buddhist mythology.

In &quot;The Lotus-Born: The Life Story of Padmasambhava, recorded by Yeshe Tsogyal,&quot; Padmasambhava receives the nickname of &quot;Rakshasa&quot; during one of his wrathful conquests to subdue Buddhist heretics.

==Jainism==

Jain accounts vary from the Hindu accounts of Rakshasa. According to Jain literature, Rakshasa was a kingdom of civilized and vegetarian people belonging to the race of Vidyadhara, who were devotees of Tirthankara.

== Islam ==
Kejawèn-influenced Indonesian Muslims view the Rakshasas as the result of people whose soul is replaced by the spirit of a devil (&quot;shayāṭīn&quot;). The devils are envious of humans and thus attempt to possess their body and minds. If they succeed, the human adapts to the new soul and gains their qualities, turning the person into a Rakshasa.

==Artistic and folkloric depictions==

The artists of Angkor in Cambodia frequently depicted Ravana in stone sculpture and bas-relief. The &quot;Nāga bridge&quot; at the entrance to the 12th-century city of Angkor Thom is lined with large stone statues of Devas and Asuras engaged in churning the Ocean of Milk. The ten-headed Ravana is shown anchoring the line of Asuras.

A bas-relief at the 12th-century temple of Angkor Wat depicts the figures churning the ocean. It includes Ravana anchoring the line of Asuras that are pulling on the serpent&#x27;s head. Scholars have speculated that one of the figures in the line of Devas is Ravana&#x27;s brother Vibhishana. They pull on a serpent&#x27;s tail to churn the Ocean of Milk. Another bas-relief at Angkor Wat shows a 20-armed Ravana shaking Mount Kailasa.

The artists of Angkor also depicted the Battle of Lanka between the Rakshasas under the command of Ravana and the Vanaras or monkeys under the command of Rama and Sugriva. The 12th-century Angkor Wat contains a dramatic bas-relief of the Battle of Lanka between Ravana&#x27;s Rakshasas and Rama&#x27;s monkeys. Ravana is depicted with ten heads and twenty arms, mounted on a chariot drawn by creatures that appear to be a mixture of horse, lion, and bird. Vibhishana is shown standing behind and aligned with Rama and his brother Lakshmana. Kumbhakarna, mounted on a similar chariot, is shown fighting Sugriva.

This battle is also depicted in a less refined bas-relief at the 12th-century temple of Preah Khan.

== In fiction ==

Rakshasa have long been a race of villains in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game. They appear as animal-headed humanoids (generally with tiger or monkey heads) with their hands inverted (palms of its hands are where the backs of the hands would be on a human). They are masters of necromancy, enchantment and illusion (which they mostly use to disguise themselves) and are very hard to kill, especially due to their partial immunity to magical effects. They ravenously prey upon humans as food and dress themselves in fine clothing. This version of the rakshasa was heavily inspired by an episode of &quot;&quot; entitled &quot;Horror in the Heights,&quot; which aired on December 20, 1974.

Rakshasa appears in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Darkness Before Dawn&quot;. He is a humanoid tiger similar to the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; depiction. This version is a fierce but benevolent guardian of the jungle who allies with Merlin against the Evil.

In the film &quot;World War Z&quot;, Rakshasa were mentioned in reference to the zombies in India.

== In languages ==
In Indonesian and Malaysian variants of Malay which have significant Sanskrit influence, &quot;raksasa&quot; now means &quot;giant&quot;, &quot;gigantic&quot;, &quot;huge and strong&quot;; the Malaysian variant recognises the word as an outright official equivalent to &quot;monster&quot; whereas the Indonesian variant uses it more in colloquial usage.

<doc id="100239" wikidata="Q188618" url="?curid=100239" title="Hanuman">
<text>Hanuman (; , ), also known as Maruti, Bajrangabali, and Anjaneya, is a deity in Hinduism, revered as a divine &quot;vanara&quot;, and a devoted companion of the deity Rama. Central to the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Hanuman is celebrated for his unwavering devotion to Rama and is considered a &quot;chiranjivi&quot;. He is traditionally believed to be the spiritual offspring of the wind deity Vayu, who is said to have played a significant role in his birth. In Shaiva tradition, he is regarded to be an incarnation of Shiva, while in most of the Vaishnava traditions he is the son and incarnation of Vayu. His tales are recounted not only in the &quot;Ramayana&quot; but also in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and various &quot;Puranas&quot;. Devotional practices centered around Hanuman were not prominent in these texts or in early archaeological evidence. His theological significance and the cultivation of a devoted following emerged roughly a millennium after the &quot;Ramayana&quot; was composed, during the second millennium CE. 

Figures from the Bhakti movement, such as Samarth Ramdas, have portrayed Hanuman as an emblem of nationalism and defiance against oppression. According to Vaishnava tradition, the sage Madhvacharya posited that Vayu aids Vishnu in his earthly incarnations, a role akin to Hanuman&#x27;s assistance to Rama. In recent times, the veneration of Hanuman through iconography and temple worship has significantly increased. He epitomizes the fusion of &quot;strength, heroic initiative, and assertive excellence&quot; with &quot;loving, emotional devotion&quot; to his lord Rama, embodying both Shakti and Bhakti. Subsequent literature has occasionally depicted him as the patron deity of martial arts, meditation, and scholarly pursuits. He is revered as an exemplar of self-control, faith, and commitment to a cause, transcending his outward Vanara appearance. Traditionally, Hanuman is celebrated as a lifelong celibate, embodying the virtues of chastity. Hanuman&#x27;s abilities are partly attributed to his lineage from Vayu, symbolizing a connection with both the physical and the cosmic elements.

Various scholars have suggested that Hanuman may have influenced the conception of Sun Wukong, the central figure in the Chinese epic &quot;Journey to the West&quot;.

==Names and etymology==

The meaning or origin of the word &quot;Hanuman&quot; is unclear. In the Hindu pantheon, deities typically have many synonymous names, each based on some noble characteristic, attribute, or reminder of a deed achieved by that deity. One interpretation of &quot;Hanuman&quot; is &quot;one having a disfigured jaw&quot;. This version is supported by a Puranic legend wherein infant Hanuman mistakes the Sun for a fruit, heroically attempts to reach it, and is wounded in the jaw for his attempt by Indra the King of Gods.

Hanuman combines two of the most cherished traits in the Hindu bhakti-shakti worship traditions: &quot;heroic, strong, assertive excellence&quot; and &quot;loving, emotional devotion to personal God&quot;.

Linguistic variations of &quot;Hanuman&quot; include &quot;Hanumat&quot;, &quot;Anuman&quot; (Tamil), &quot;Hanumantha&quot; (Kannada), &quot;Hanumanthudu&quot; (Telugu). Other names include:
* &quot;Anjaneya&quot;, &quot;Anjaniputra&quot; (Kannada), &quot;Anjaneyar&quot; (Tamil), &quot;Anjaneyudu&quot; (Telugu), &quot;Anjanisuta&quot; all meaning &quot;the son of Anjana&quot;
* &quot;Kesari Nandana or Kesarisuta&quot;, based on his father, which means &quot;son of Kesari&quot;
* &quot;Vayuputra/ Pavanputra&quot; : the son of the Vayu deva- Wind god
* &quot;Vajrang Bali/Bajrang Bali&quot;, &quot;the strong one (&quot;bali&quot;), who had limbs (&quot;anga&quot;) as hard or as tough as vajra (&quot;diamond&quot;)&quot;; this name is widely used in rural North India
* &quot;Sankata Mochana&quot;, &quot;the remover of dangers, hardships, or hurdles&quot; (&quot;sankata&quot;)
* &quot;Māruti&quot;, &quot;son of Maruta&quot; (another name of Vayu deva)
* &quot;Kapeeshwara&quot;, &quot;lord of monkeys.&quot;
* &quot;Rama Doota&quot;, &quot;the messenger (&quot;doota&quot;) of Rama&quot;
* &quot;Mahakaya&quot;, &quot;gigantic&quot;
* &quot;Vira&quot;, &quot;Mahavira&quot;, &quot;most valiant&quot;
* &quot;Mahabala/Mahabali&quot;, &quot;the strongest one&quot;
* &quot;Vanarkulathin Thondaiman&quot;, &quot;descendant of the Vanar clan&quot; (Tamil)
* &quot;Panchavaktra&quot;, &quot;five-faced&quot;
* &quot;Mukhya Prana Devaru&quot;, &quot;Primordial Life Giver&quot; (more prominent amongst followers of Dvaita, such as Madhwas)

== Historical development ==
===Vedic roots===
The earliest mention of a divine monkey is in hymn 10.86 of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, dated to between 1500 and 1200 BCE. The twenty-three verses of the hymn are a metaphorical and riddle-filled legend. It is presented as a dialogue between multiple figures: the god Indra, his wife Indrani and an energetic monkey it refers to as &quot;Vrisakapi&quot; and his wife &quot;Kapi&quot;. The hymn opens with Indrani complaining to Indra that some of the soma offerings for Indra have been allocated to the energetic and strong monkey, and the people are forgetting Indra. The king of the gods, Indra, responds by telling his wife that the living being (monkey) that bothers her is to be seen as a friend, and that they should make an effort to coexist peacefully. The hymn closes with all agreeing that they should come together in Indra&#x27;s house and share the wealth of the offerings.

===Epics and Puranas===
Hanuman is mentioned in both the Hindu epics, &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

Hanuman is mentioned in the Puranas. The Shiva Purana mentions Hanuman as an avatar of Shiva; all other Puranas and scriptures clearly mention him as the spiritual son of Vayu or incarnation of Vayu or sometimes avatar of Rudra (which is also another name of Vayu). Commonly, Hanuman is not related to Shiva in Vaishnava traditions but is known as Shiva&#x27;s avatar or sun in Shaiva traditions.

Other texts, such as those found in South India, present Hanuman as a being who is the union of Shiva and Vishnu, or associated with the origin of Ayyappa. The 17th century Odia work &quot;Rasavinoda&quot; by Dinakrishnadasa goes on to mention that the three gods – Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva – combined to take to the form of Hanuman.

===Late medieval and modern era===

In Valmiki&#x27;s &quot;Ramayana&quot;, estimated to have been composed before or in about the 3rd century BCE, Hanuman is an important, creative figure as a simian helper and messenger for Rama. It is, however, in the late medieval era that his profile evolves into a more central role and dominance as the exemplary spiritual devotee, particularly with the popular vernacular text &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; by Tulsidas (~ 1575 CE). According to scholars such as Patrick Peebles and others, during a period of religious turmoil and Islamic rule of the Indian subcontinent, the Bhakti movement and devotionalism-oriented Bhakti yoga had emerged as a major trend in Hindu culture by the 16th-century, and the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; presented Rama as a Vishnu avatar, supreme being and a personal god worthy of devotion, with Hanuman as the ideal loving devotee with legendary courage, strength and powers.

During this era, Hanuman evolved and emerged as the ideal combination of shakti and bhakti. Stories and folk traditions in and after the 17th century, began to reformulate and present Hanuman as a divine being, as a descendant of deities, and as an avatar of Shiva. He emerged as a champion of those religiously persecuted, expressing resistance, a yogi, an inspiration for martial artists and warriors, a character with less fur and increasingly human, symbolizing cherished virtues and internal values, and worthy of devotion in his own right. This evolution of Hanuman&#x27;s religious status, and his cultural role as well as his iconography, continued through the colonial era and into post-colonial times.

==Legends==
===Birth===

According to Hindu legends, Hanuman was born to mother Anjana and father Kesari. Hanuman is also called the son of the deity Vayu (Wind god) because of legends associated with Vayu&#x27;s role in Hanuman&#x27;s birth. He is also said to be the incarnation of Shiva (Destroyer god). One story mentioned in Eknath&#x27;s &quot;Bhavartha Ramayana&quot; (16th century CE) states that when Anjana was worshiping Vayu, the King Dasharatha of Ayodhya was also performing the ritual of Putrakameshti yagna in order to have children. As a result, he received some sacred pudding (payasam) to be shared by his three wives, leading to the births of Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna. By divine ordinance, a kite snatched a fragment of that pudding and dropped it while flying over the forest where Anjana was engaged in worship. Vayu delivered the falling pudding to the outstretched hands of Anjana, who consumed it, leading to the birth of Hanuman.

Maharshi Veda Vyasa proposed Anjanadri Hill at Tirumala is the birthplace of Hanuman. Anjaneri in Nasik, Maharashtra along with Anjeneri Anjanadri (Near Hampi) in Gangavathi Taluk Koppal District, Karnataka is one of a number of places that claim to be the location of Kishkinda.

===Childhood===
According to Valmiki&#x27;s Ramayana, one morning in his childhood, Hanuman was hungry and saw the sun. Mistaking it for a ripe fruit, he leapt up to eat it. In one version of the Hindu legend, the king of gods Indra intervened and struck Hanuman with his thunderbolt. It hit Hanuman on his jaw, and he fell to the earth dead with a broken jaw. Hanuman&#x27;s father, Vayu, became upset and withdrew all the air from Earth. The lack of air created immense suffering to all living beings. This led Shiva to intervene and resuscitate Hanuman, which in turn prompted Vayu to return air to the living beings. As the mistake was done by the god Indra, he grants Hanuman a wish that his body would be as strong as Indra&#x27;s Vajra, and that his Vajra can also not harm him. Along with Indra other gods have also granted him wishes: the God Agni granted Hanuman a wish that fire won&#x27;t harm him; God Varuna granted a wish for Hanuman that water won&#x27;t harm him; God Vayu granted a wish for Hanuman that he will be as fast as wind and that the wind won&#x27;t harm him. Brahma also granted Hanuman a wish that he can move to any place where he cannot be stopped. Hence these wishes make Hanuman an immortal, who has unique powers and strength.

In another Hindu version of his childhood legend, which is likely older and also found in Jain texts such as the 8th-century &quot;Dhurtakhyana&quot;, Hanuman&#x27;s leap to the sun proves to be fatal and he is burnt to ashes from the sun&#x27;s heat. His ashes fall onto the earth and oceans. Gods then gather the ashes and his bones from land and, with the help of fishes, re-assemble him. They find everything except one fragment of his jawbone. His great-grandfather on his mother&#x27;s side then asks Surya to restore the child to life. Surya returns him to life, but Hanuman is left with a disfigured jaw. Hanuman is said to have spent his childhood in Kishkindha.

Some time after this event, Hanuman begins using his supernatural powers on innocent bystanders as simple pranks, until one day he pranks a meditating sage. In fury, the sage curses Hanuman to forget the vast majority of his powers. The curse remains in effect until he is reminded of his powers in his adulthood.

=== Adulthood ===
====Ramayana====
After Rama and his brother Lakshmana, searching for Rama&#x27;s kidnapped wife, Sita, arrive in Kishkindha, the new king, and Rama&#x27;s newfound ally the monkey king Sugriva, agree to send scouts in all four directions to search for Rama&#x27;s missing wife. To the south, Sugriva sends Hanuman and some others, including the great bear Jambavan. This group travels all the way to the southernmost tip of India, where they encounter the ocean with the island of Lanka (said to be modern day Sri Lanka) visible in the horizon. The group wishes to investigate the island, but none can swim or jump so far (it was common for such supernatural powers to be common amongst figures in these epics). However, Jambavan knows from prior events that Hanuman used to be able to do such a feat with ease and lifts his curse.
The curse lifted; Hanuman now remembers all of his dynamic divine powers. He is said to have transformed into the size of mountain and flew across the narrow channel to Lanka. Upon landing, he discovers a city populated by the Lanka king Ravana and his demon followers, so he shrinks down to the size of an ant and sneaks into the city. After searching the city, he discovers Sita in a grove, guarded by demon warriors. When they all fall asleep, he meets with Sita and discusses how he came to find her. She reveals that Ravana kidnapped her and is forcing her to marry him soon. He offers to rescue her but Sita refuses, stating that her husband must do it.

What happens next differs by account, but a common tale is that after visiting Sita, he starts destroying the grove, prompting his capture. Regardless of the tale, he ends up captured in the court of Ravana himself, who laughs when Hanuman tells him that Rama is coming to take back Sita. Ravana orders his servants to light Hanuman&#x27;s tail on fire as torture for threatening his safety. However, every time they put on an oil-soaked cloth to burn, he grows his tail longer so that more cloths need to be added. This continues until Ravana has had enough and orders the lighting to begin. However, when his tail is lit, he shrinks his tail back and breaks free of his bonds with his superhuman strength. He jumps out a window and jumps from rooftop to rooftop, burning down building after building, until much of the city is ablaze. Seeing this triumph, Hanuman leaves back for India.

When he returns, he tells his scouting party what had occurred, and they rush back to Kishkindha, where Rama had been waiting all along for news. Hearing that Sita was safe and was awaiting him, Rama gathered the support of Sugriva&#x27;s army and marched for Lanka. Thus begins the legendary Battle of Lanka.

Throughout the long battle, Hanuman played a role as a general in the army. During one intense fight, Lakshmana, Rama&#x27;s brother, was fatally wounded; it was thought that he would die without the aid of a herb from a Himalayan mountain. Hanuman was the only one who could make the journey so quickly, and was thus sent to the mountain.
Upon arriving, he discovered that there were many herbs along the mountainside, and did not want to take the wrong herb back. So instead, he grew to the size of a mountain, ripped the mountain from the Earth, and flew it back to the battle. A chunk of this mountain was said to have fallen down and the present day &quot;Forts Purandar and Vajragad&quot; are believed to be the fallen pieces.

In the end, Rama revealed his divine powers as the incarnation of the God Vishnu, and slew Ravana and the rest of the demon army. Finally, Rama returned to his home of Ayodhya to return to his place as king. After blessing all those who aided him in the battle with gifts, Rama gave Hanuman his gift, which Hanuman threw away. Many court officials, perplexed, were angered by this act. Hanuman replied that rather than needing a gift to remember Rama, he would always be in his heart. Some court officials, still upset, asked him for proof, and Hanuman tore open his chest, which had an image of Rama and Sita on his heart.
Now proven as a true devotee, Rama cured him and blessed him with immortality, but Hanuman refused this and asked only for a place at Rama&#x27;s feet to worship him. Touched, Rama blessed him with immortality anyway. Like Shesha Nag, Hanuman would live on after the &quot;kalpa&quot; (destruction of the universe).

====Mahabharata====

Centuries after the events of the Ramayana, and during the events of the Mahabharata, Hanuman is now a nearly forgotten demigod living his life in a forest. After some time, his spiritual brother through the god Vayu, Bhima, passes through looking for flowers for his wife. Hanuman senses this and decides to teach him a lesson, as Bhima had been known to be boastful of his superhuman strength (at this point in time supernatural powers were much rarer than in the Ramayana but still seen in the Hindu epics). Bhima encountered Hanuman lying on the ground in the shape of a feeble old monkey. He asked Hanuman to move, but he would not. As stepping over an individual was considered extremely disrespectful in this time, Hanuman suggested lifting his tail up to create a passage. Bhima heartily accepted, but could not lift the tail to any avail.

Bhima, humbled, realized that the frail monkey was some sort of deity, and asked him to reveal himself. Hanuman revealed himself, much to Bhima&#x27;s surprise, and the brothers embraced. Hanuman prophesied that Bhima would soon be a part of a terrible war, and promised Bhima that he would sit on the flag of his brother Arjuna&#x27;s chariot and shout a battle cry for Bhima that would weaken the hearts of his enemies. Content, Hanuman left his brother to his search.

==Attributes==
Hanuman has many attributes, including:
* &quot;Chiranjivi&quot; (immortal): various versions of &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Rama Katha&quot; state towards their end, just before Rama and Lakshmana die, that Hanuman is blessed to be immortal. He will be a part of humanity forever, while the story of Rama lives on and the story will go on as the gods recite the story always. Thus, he will live forever.
* &quot;Brahmachari&quot; (self-controlled): one who control their lust from all materialistic things of material world.
* &quot;Kurūp&quot; and &quot;Sundar&quot;: he is described in Hindu texts as &quot;kurūp&quot; (ugly) on the outside, but divinely &quot;sundar&quot; (beautiful inside). The Hanuman Chalisa describes him as handsome with a complexion of molten gold (&quot;kanchana barana birāja subesā&quot;).
* &quot;Kama-rupin&quot;: He can shapeshift, become smaller than the smallest, larger than the largest adversary at will. He uses this attribute to shrink and enter Lanka, as he searches for the kidnapped Sita imprisoned in Lanka. Later on, he takes on the size of a mountain, blazing with radiance, to show his true power to Sita.
* &quot;Strength&quot;: Hanuman is extraordinarily strong, one capable of lifting and carrying any burden for a cause. He is called &quot;Vira&quot;, &quot;Mahavira&quot;, &quot;Mahabala&quot; and other names signifying this attribute of his. During the epic war between Rama and Ravana, Rama&#x27;s brother Lakshmana is wounded. He can only be healed and his death prevented by a herb found in a particular Himalayan mountain. Hanuman leaps and finds the mountain. There, states &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Hanuman finds the mountain is full of many herbs. He doesn&#x27;t know which one to take. So, he lifts the entire Himalayan mountain and carries it across India to Lanka for Lakshmana. His immense strength thus helps Lakshmana recover from his wound. This legend is the popular basis for the iconography where he is shown flying and carrying a mountain on his palm.
* &quot;Innovative&quot;: Hanuman is described as someone who constantly faces very difficult odds, where the adversary or circumstances threaten his mission with certain defeat and his very existence. Yet he finds an innovative way to turn the odds. For example, after he finds Sita, delivers Rama&#x27;s message, and persuades her that he is indeed Rama&#x27;s true messenger, he is discovered by the prison guards. They arrest Hanuman, and under Ravana&#x27;s orders take him to a public execution. There, Ravana&#x27;s guards begin his torture by tying his tail with oiled cloth and setting it on fire. Hanuman then leaps from one palace rooftop to another, burning everything down in the process.
* &quot;Bhakti&quot;: Hanuman is presented as the exemplary devotee (&quot;bhakta&quot;) of Rama and Sita. The Hindu texts such as the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, the &quot;Bhakta Mala&quot;, the &quot;Ananda Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Ramacharitmanas&quot; present him as someone who is talented, strong, brave and spiritually devoted to Rama. The Rama stories such as the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Ramacharitmanas&quot;, in turn themselves, present the Hindu dharmic concept of the ideal, virtuous and compassionate man (Rama) and woman (Sita) thereby providing the context for attributes assigned therein for Hanuman.
* &quot;Learned Yogi&quot;: In the late medieval texts and thereafter, such as those by Tulasidas, attributes of Hanuman include learned in Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism, the Vedas, a poet, a polymath, a grammarian, a singer and musician par excellence.
* &quot;Remover of obstacles&quot;: in devotional literature, Hanuman is the remover of difficulties.
* &quot;Healer of diseases, pains and sorrows:&quot; Heals all kinds of diseases, pains and sorrows of devotees.
* &quot;Slayer of demons, evil and negative energies:&quot; Hanuman is offered worship to rid of negative influences, such as ghosts, evil spirits and ill-intentioned humans. The following names of Hanuman describe some of these qualities, &quot;Rakshovidhwansakaraka, Akshahantre, Dashagreevakulantaka, Lankineebhanjana, Simhikaprana Bhanjana, Maharavanamardana, Kalanemi Pramathana.&quot;
* &quot;Protector and saviour of devotees of Shri Ram and himself:&quot; The doorkeeper and protector of the door to Rama&#x27;s court, and protector and saviour of devotees.
* &quot;Five-faced or Panchamukha when he assumes his fierce form:&quot; East facing Hanuman face (Anjaneya) that grants purity of mind and success. South facing man-lion face Narasimha that West facing Garuda face, north facing Boar face Varaha and horse face (Hayagriva) facing towards the sky (upwards).

== Texts ==
===Hinduism===

==== Ramayana ====
The Sundara Kanda, the fifth book in the Ramayana, focuses on Hanuman. Hanuman meets Rama in the last year of the latter&#x27;s 14-year exile, after the demon king Ravana had kidnapped Sita. With his brother Lakshmana, Rama is searching for his wife Sita. This, and related Rama legends are the most extensive stories about Hanuman.

Numerous versions of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; exist within India. These present variant legends of Hanuman, Rama, Sita, Lakshamana and Ravana. The figures and their descriptions vary, in some cases quite significantly.

====Mahabharata====

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; is another major epic which has a short mention of Hanuman. In Book 3, the Vana Parva of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, he is presented as a half-brother of Bhima, who meets him accidentally on his way to Mount Kailasha. A man of extraordinary strength, Bhima is unable to move Hanuman&#x27;s tail, making him realize and acknowledge the strength of Hanuman. This story attests to the ancient chronology of Hanuman. It is also a part of artwork and reliefs such as those at the Vijayanagara ruins.

=== Other literature ===
Apart from Ramayana and Mahabharata, Hanuman is mentioned in several other texts. Some of these stories add to his adventures mentioned in the earlier epics, while others tell alternative stories of his life. The &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; mentions Hanuman in Rameswaram.

In a South Indian version of &quot;Shiva Purana&quot;, Hanuman is described as the son of Shiva and Mohini (the female avatar of Vishnu), or alternatively he has been linked to or merged with the origin of Swami Ayyappa who is popular in parts of South India.

In the &quot;Muktikā Upanishad&quot; Hanuman is in dialogue with Rama about the subject of moksha.

==== Hanuman Chalisa ====
The 16th-century Indian poet Tulsidas wrote &quot;Hanuman Chalisa&quot;, a devotional song dedicated to Hanuman. He claimed to have visions where he met face to face with Hanuman. Based on these meetings, he wrote &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot;, an Awadhi language version of Ramayana.

====Relation with Devi or Shakti====
The relation between Hanuman and the goddess Kali finds mention in the &quot;Krittivasi Ramayana&quot;. Their meeting takes place in the Yuddha Kanda of this &quot;Ramayana&quot;, in the legend of Mahiravana. Mahiravana is stated to be the king of the Patala (netherworld) and a trusted friend/brother of Ravana. After his son, Indrajita, was killed, Ravana sought Mahiravana&#x27;s help to kill Rama and Lakshmana. One night, Mahiravana, using his &quot;maya&quot;, took Vibhishana&#x27;s form and entered Rama&#x27;s camp. He cast the &quot;nidra mantra&quot; (sleeping spell) on the vanara army, kidnapped Rama and Lakshmana, and took them to Patala to sacrifice them to Devi, as per Ravana&#x27;s suggestion. Hanuman learnt the way to Patala from Vibhishana and made haste to rescue his lords. On his journey, he met Makardhwaja, who claimed of being Hanuman&#x27;s son. Hanuman defeated and tied him, and went inside the palace. He met Chandrasena, who told about the sacrifice and the way to kill Mahiravana. Hanuman shrunk his size to that of a bee and came across a huge idol of Kali. After being prayed to, the goddess agreed to help Hanuman rescue the brothers, allowing him to take her place while she slipped below. When Mahiravana asked the brothers to bow, they refused, claiming not to know how to perform the act. As Mahiravana decided to demonstrate, Hanuman assumed his &quot;panchamukha&quot; (five-faced) form (manifesting the additional heads of Garuda, Narasimha, Varaha, and Hayagriva), blowing the five oil lamps present in the chamber in the five cardinal directions. He severed the head of Mahiravana, thus killing him. He carried Rama and Lakshmana upon his shoulders to return them to their camp, before which he released and crowned Makaradhvaja the king of Patala. The story of Ahiravan finds its place in the Ramayanas of the east. It can be found in the Bengali version of the Ramayana, written by Krittibash, in the passage known as &quot;Mahirabonerpala&quot;. It is believed that Kali, pleased with Hanuman, blessed him to be her &quot;dvarapala&quot; (gatekeeper).

=== Buddhism ===
Hanuman appears in Tibetan Buddhism (southwest China) and Khotanese (west China, central Asia and northern Iran) versions of Ramayana. The Khotanese versions have a Jātaka tales-like theme but are generally similar to the Hindu texts in the storyline of Hanuman. The Tibetan version is more embellished, and without attempts to reference the Jātakas. Also, in the Tibetan version, novel elements appear such as Hanuman carrying love letters between Rama and Sita, in addition to the Hindu version wherein Rama sends the wedding ring with him as a message to Sita. Further, in the Tibetan version, Rama chides Hanuman for not corresponding with him through letters more often, implying that the monkey-messenger and warrior is a learned being who can read and write.
In the Sri Lankan versions of Ramayana, which are titled after Ravana, the story is less melodramatic than the Indian stories. Many of the legends recounting Hanuman&#x27;s bravery and innovative ability are found in the Sinhala versions. The stories in which the figures are involved have Buddhist themes, and lack the embedded ethics and values structure according to Hindu dharma. According to Hera Walker, some Sinhalese communities seek the aid of Hanuman through prayers to his mother. In Chinese Buddhist texts, states Arthur Cotterall, myths mention the meeting of the Buddha with Hanuman, as well as Hanuman&#x27;s great triumphs. According to Rosalind Lefeber, the arrival of Hanuman in East Asian Buddhist texts may trace its roots to the translation of the Ramayana into Chinese and Tibetan in the 6th-century CE.

In both China and Japan, much like in India, there is a lack of a radical divide between humans and animals, with all living beings and nature assumed to be related to humans. There is no exaltation of humans over animals or nature, unlike the Western traditions. A divine monkey has been a part of the historic literature and culture of China and Japan, possibly influenced by the close cultural contact through Buddhist monks and pilgrimage to India over two millennia. For example, the Japanese text &quot;Keiranshuyoshu&quot;, while presenting its mythology about a divine monkey, that is the theriomorphic Shinto emblem of Hie shrines, describes a flying white monkey that carries a mountain from India to China, then from China to Japan. This story is based on a passage in the Ramayana where the wounded hero asks Hanuman to bring a certain herbal medicine from the Himalayas. As Hanuman does not know the herb he brings the entire mountain for the hero to choose from. By that time a learned medicine man from Lanka discovered the cure and Hanuman brings the mountain back to where he got it from.
Many Japanese Shinto shrines and village boundaries, dated from the 8th to the 14th centuries, feature a monkey deity as guardian or intermediary between humans and gods (kami).

The Jātaka tales contain Hanuman-like stories. For example, the Buddha is described as a monkey-king in one of his earlier births in the &quot;Mahakapi Jātaka&quot;, wherein he as a compassionate monkey suffers and is abused, but who nevertheless continues to follow dharma in helping a human being who is lost and in danger.

=== Jainism ===
&quot;Paumacariya&quot; (also known as &quot;Pauma Chariu&quot; or &quot;Padmacharit&quot;), the Jain version of Ramayana written by Vimalasuri, mentions Hanuman not as a divine monkey, but as a Vidyadhara (a supernatural being, demigod in Jain cosmology). He is the son of Pavangati (wind deity) and Anjana Sundari. Anjana gives birth to Hanuman in a forest cave, after being banished by her in-laws. Her maternal uncle rescues her from the forest; while boarding his vimana, Anjana accidentally drops her baby on a rock. However, the baby remains uninjured while the rock is shattered. The baby is raised in Hanuruha, thus receiving the name &quot;Hanuman.&quot;

There are major differences from the Hindu text: Hanuman is a supernatural being in Jain texts, Rama is a pious Jaina who never kills anyone, and it is Lakshamana who kills Ravana. Hanuman becomes a supporter of Rama after meeting him and learning about Sita&#x27;s kidnapping by Ravana. He goes to Lanka on Rama&#x27;s behalf but is unable to convince Ravana to give up Sita. Ultimately, he joins Rama in the war against Ravana and performs several heroic deeds.

Later Jain texts, such as &quot;Uttarapurana&quot; (9th century CE) by Gunabhadra and &quot;Anjana-Pavananjaya&quot; (12th century CE), tell the same story.

In several versions of the Jain &quot;Ramayana&quot; story, there are passages that explain the connection of Hanuman and Rama (called Pauma in Jainism). Hanuman, in these versions, ultimately renounces all social life to become a Jain ascetic.

=== Sikhism ===
In Sikhism, the Hindu god Rama has been referred to as Sri Ram Chandar, and the story of Hanuman as a &quot;siddha&quot; has been influential. After the birth of the martial Sikh Khalsa movement in 1699, during the 18th and 19th centuries, Hanuman was an inspiration and object of reverence by the Khalsa. Some Khalsa regiments brought along the Hanuman image to the battleground. The Sikh texts such as &quot;Hanuman Natak&quot; composed by Hirda Ram Bhalla, and &quot;Das Gur Katha&quot; by Kavi Kankan describe the heroic deeds of Hanuman. According to Louis Fenech, the Sikh tradition states that Guru Gobind Singh was a fond reader of the &quot;Hanuman Natak&quot; text.

During the colonial era, in Sikh seminaries in what is now Pakistan, Sikh teachers were called &quot;bhai&quot;, and they were required to study the &quot;Hanuman Natak&quot;, the Hanuman story containing &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; and other texts, all of which were available in Gurmukhi script.

Bhagat Kabir, a prominent writer of the scripture explicitly states that Hanuman does not know the full glory of the divine. This statement is in the context of the Divine as being unlimited and ever expanding. Ananta is therefore a name of the divine. In Sanskrit, &quot;anta&quot; means &quot;end&quot;. The prefix &quot;-an&quot; is added to create the word &quot;Ananta&quot; (meaning &quot;without end&quot; or &quot;unlimited&quot;).

=== Southeast Asian texts ===

There exist non-Indian versions of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, such as the Thai &quot;Ramakien.&quot; According to these versions of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Macchanu is the son of Hanuman borne by Suvannamaccha, daughter of Ravana.

Another legend says that a demigod named Matsyaraja (also known as Makardhwaja or Matsyagarbha) claimed to be his son. Matsyaraja&#x27;s birth is explained as follows: a fish (&quot;matsya&quot;) was impregnated by the drops of Hanuman&#x27;s sweat, while he was bathing in the ocean.

Hanuman in southeast Asian texts differs from the north Indian Hindu version in various ways in the Burmese Ramayana, such as &quot;Rama Yagan&quot;, &quot;Alaung Rama Thagyin&quot; (in the Arakanese dialect), &quot;Rama Vatthu&quot; and &quot;Rama Thagyin&quot;, the Malay Ramayana, such as &quot;Hikayat Sri Rama&quot; and &quot;Hikayat Maharaja Ravana&quot;, and the Thai Ramayana, such as &quot;Ramakien&quot;. However, in some cases, the aspects of the story are similar to Hindu versions and Buddhist versions of Ramayana found elsewhere on the Indian subcontinent.

==Significance and influence==

Hanuman became more important in the medieval period and came to be portrayed as the ideal devotee (bhakta) of Rama. Hanuman&#x27;s life, devotion, and strength inspired wrestlers in India.

Devotionalism to Hanuman and his theological significance emerged long after the composition of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, in the 2nd millennium CE. His prominence grew after the arrival of Islamic rule in the Indian subcontinent. He is viewed as the ideal combination of shakti (&quot;strength, heroic initiative and assertive excellence&quot;) and bhakti (&quot;loving, emotional devotion to his personal god Rama&quot;). Beyond wrestlers, he has been the patron god of other martial arts. He is stated to be a gifted grammarian, meditating yogi and diligent scholar. He exemplifies the human excellences of temperance, faith and service to a cause.
In 17th-century north and western regions of India, Hanuman emerged as an expression of resistance and dedication against Islamic persecution. For example, the bhakti poet-saint Ramdas presented Hanuman as a symbol of Marathi nationalism and resistance to Mughal Empire.

Hanuman in the colonial and post-colonial era has been a cultural icon, as a symbolic ideal combination of shakti and bhakti, as a right of Hindu people to express and pursue their forms of spirituality and religious beliefs (dharma). Political and religious organizations have named themselves after him or his synonyms such as &quot;Bajrang&quot;. Political parades or religious processions have featured men dressed up as Hanuman, along with women dressed up as &quot;gopis&quot; (milkmaids) of god Krishna, as an expression of their pride and right to their heritage, culture and religious beliefs. According to some scholars, the Hanuman-linked youth organizations have tended to have a paramilitary wing and have opposed other religions, with a mission of resisting the &quot;evil eyes of Islam, Christianity and Communism&quot;, or as a symbol of Hindu nationalism.

==Iconography==


The earliest known sculptures of Hanuman date from the Gupta Empire ca. 500 CE. In these very early representations, Hanuman is not yet shown as a sole figure. Free standing &quot;murtis&quot; or statues of Hanuman appeared from ca. 700 CE. onwards. These murtis portrayed Hanuman with one hand raised, one foot suppressing a demon, and an erect tail. In later centuries his raised hand was sometimes shown supporting a mountain of healing herbs.

Hanuman&#x27;s iconography is derived from Valmiki&#x27;s &quot;Ramayana.&quot; He is usually portrayed with other central figures of the Ramayana – Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He carries weapons such as a gada (mace) and thunderbolt (&quot;vajra&quot;).

His iconography and temples are common today. He is typically shown with Rama, Sita and Lakshmana, near or in Vaishnavism temples, as well as by himself usually opening his chest to symbolically show images of Rama and Sita near his heart. He is also popular among the followers of Shaivism.

In north India, an iconic representation of Hanuman such as a round stone has been in use by yogis, as a means to help focus on the abstract aspects of him.

==Temples and shrines==

Hanuman is often worshipped along with Rama and Sita of Vaishnavism, and sometimes independently of them. There are numerous statues to celebrate or temples to worship Hanuman all over India. Vanamali says, &quot;Vaishnavites or followers of Vishnu, believe that the wind god Vayu underwent three incarnations to help Vishnu. As Hanuman he helped Rama, as Bhima, he assisted Krishna, and as Madhvacharya (1238–1317) he founded the Vaishnava sect called Dvaita&quot;. Shaivites claim him as an avatar of Shiva. Lutgendorf writes, &quot;The later identification of Hanuman as one of the eleven rudras may reflect a Shaiva sectarian claim on an increasing popular god, it also suggests his kinship with, and hence potential control over, a class of awesome and ambivalent deities&quot;. Lutgendorf also writes, &quot;Other skills in Hanuman&#x27;s resume also seem to derive in part from his windy patrimony, reflecting Vayu&#x27;s role in both body and cosmos&quot;. According to a review by Lutgendorf, some scholars state that the earliest Hanuman murtis appeared in the 8th century, but verifiable evidence of Hanuman images and inscriptions appear in the 10th century in Indian monasteries in central and north India.

Tuesday and Saturday of every week are particularly popular days at Hanuman temples. Some people keep a partial or full fast on either of those two days and remember Hanuman and the theology he represents to them.

Major temples and shrines of Hanuman include:
* The oldest known independent Hanuman temple and statue is at Khajuraho, dated to about 922 CE from the Khajuraho Hanuman inscription.
* Hanumangarhi, Ayodhya, is a 10th-century temple dedicated to Hanuman.
* Panchmukhi Hanuman Temple is a 1,500-year-old temple in Pakistan. It is located in Soldier Bazaar in Karachi, Pakistan. The temple is highly venerated by Pakistani Hindus as it is the only temple in the world which has a natural statue of Hanuman that is not man-made (Swayambhu).
* Jakhu temple in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh contains a monumental 108-foot (33-metre) statue of Hanuman and is the highest point in Shimla.
* The tallest Hanuman statue is the Veera Abhaya Anjaneya Swami, standing 135 feet tall at Paritala, 32 km from Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, installed in 2003.
* Chitrakoot in Madhya Pradesh features the Hanuman Dhara temple, which features a panchmukhi statue of Hanuman. It is located inside a forest, and it along with Ramghat that is a few kilometers away, are significant Hindu pilgrimage sites.
* The Peshwa era rulers in 18th century city of Pune provided endowments to more Hanuman temples than to temples of other deities such as Shiva, Ganesh or Vitthal. Even in present time there are more Hanuman temples in the city and the district than of other deities.
* One of the major temples of Hanuman is Hanuman Temple Salangpur in based in Salangpur, Gujarat. There is also a statue of Hanuman which is 54 ft tall.

* Outside India, a major Hanuman statue has been built by Tamil Hindus near the Batu caves in Malaysia, and an Karya Siddhi Hanuman statue by colonial era Hindu indentured workers&#x27; descendants at Carapichaima in Trinidad and Tobago. Another Karya Siddhi Hanuman Temple has been built in Frisco, Texas in the United States. In 2024, another Hanuman statue was inaugurated in Texas with the name Statue of Union, which is now the fourth-tallest statue in the US.

===Festivals and celebrations===
Hanuman is a central figure in the annual Ramlila celebrations in India, and seasonal dramatic arts in southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand; and Bali and Java, Indonesia. Ramlila is a dramatic folk re-enactment of the life of Rama according to the ancient Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot; or secondary literature based on it such as the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot;. It particularly refers to the thousands of dramatic plays and dance events that are staged during the annual autumn festival of Navratri in India. Hanuman is featured in many parts of the folk-enacted play of the legendary war between Good and Evil, with the celebrations climaxing in Vijayadashami.

The Ramlila festivities were declared by UNESCO as one of the &quot;Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity&quot; in 2008. Ramlila is particularly notable in the historically important Hindu cities of Ayodhya, Varanasi, Vrindavan, Almora, Satna and Madhubani – cities in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.

Hanuman&#x27;s birthday is observed by some Hindus as Hanuman Jayanti. It falls in much of India in the traditional month of Chaitra in the lunisolar Hindu calendar, which overlaps with March and April. However, in parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Hanuman Jayanti is observed in the regional Hindu month of Mārgaḻi, which overlaps with December and January. The festive day is observed with devotees gathering at Hanuman temples before sunrise, and day long spiritual recitations and story reading about the victory of good over evil.

== Hanuman in Southeast Asia ==
=== Cambodia ===

Hanuman is a revered heroic figure in Khmer history in southeast Asia. He features predominantly in the Reamker, a Cambodian epic poem, based on the Sanskrit Itihasa Ramayana epic. Intricate carvings on the walls of Angkor Wat depict scenes from the Ramayana including those of Hanuman.

In Cambodia and many other parts of southeast Asia, mask dance and shadow theatre arts celebrate Hanuman with Ream (same as Rama of India). Hanuman is represented by a white mask. Particularly popular in southeast Asian theatre are Hanuman&#x27;s accomplishments as a martial artist &quot;Ramayana&quot;.

=== Indonesia ===

Hanuman (Indonesian: &quot;Hanoman&quot; or &quot;Anoman&quot; ) is the central figure in many of the historic dance and drama art works such as Wayang Wong found in Javanese culture, Indonesia. These performance arts can be traced to at least the 10th century. He has been popular, along with the local versions of &quot;Ramayana&quot; in other islands of Indonesia such as Java.
In major medieval era Hindu temples, archeological sites and manuscripts discovered in Indonesian and Malay islands, Hanuman features prominently along with Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, Vishvamitra and Sugriva. The most studied and detailed relief artworks are found in the Candis Panataran and Prambanan.

Hanuman, along with other figures of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, are an important source of plays and dance theatre repertoire at Odalan celebrations and other festivals in Bali.

====Wayang story====

Hanoman in Javanese wayang is the son of Batara Guru who became the disciple and adopted son of Batara Bayu. Hanoman himself is a cross-generational figure from the time of Rama to the time of Jayabaya. Anjani is the eldest daughter of Rishi Gotama who is cursed so that she has the face of an ape. On the orders of his father, he was imprisoned naked in the lake Madirda. Once upon a time, Batara Guru and Batara Narada flew across the sky. When he saw Anjani, Batara Guru was so amazed that he released semen. The king of the puppet gods rubbed it with tamarind leaves and threw it into the lake. The sinom leaf fell on Anjani&#x27;s lap. She also picked it up and ate it until she became pregnant. When it was time to give birth, Anjani was assisted by the angels sent by Batara Guru. She gave birth to a baby monkey with white hair, while herself again had a beautiful face and was taken to heaven as an angel.

The baby, in the form of a white monkey, which is Anjani&#x27;s son, was taken by Batara Bayu and adopted as a child. After completing his education, Hanoman returned to the world and served his uncle, Sugriwa, the monkey king of Kiskenda Cave. At that time, Sugriwa had just been defeated by his brother, Subali, another uncle of Hanoman. Hanoman managed to meet Rama and Laksmana, a pair of princes from Ayodhya who were undergoing exile. The two then work together with Sugriwa to defeat Subali, and together attack the land of Alengka to free Sita, Rama&#x27;s wife who was kidnapped by Rahwana, Subali&#x27;s disciple.

Hanoman infiltrates the Alengka palace to investigate Ravana&#x27;s power and witness Sita&#x27;s plight. There he made such a mess that he was caught and burned. Instead, Hanoman actually managed to burn parts of the capital city of Alengka. This event is known as Hanuman Obong. After Hanoman returned to Rama&#x27;s place, the monkey army set out to attack Alengka. Hanoman appears as a hero who kills many Alengka troops, for example Surpanaka (Sarpakenaka) Ravana&#x27;s younger brother. In the final battle between Rama and Ravana, he was overwhelmed with his Aji Pancasu, the ability to live eternally. Every time Rama&#x27;s weapon killed Ravana, immediately Ravana rose again. Wibisana, Ravana&#x27;s sister who sided with Rama immediately asked Hanoman to help. Hanoman also lifted Mount Ungaran to fall on top of Ravana&#x27;s corpse when Ravana had just died at the hands of Rama for the umpteenth time. Seeing Hanuman&#x27;s impudence, Rama also punished him to guard Ravana&#x27;s grave. Rama believes that Ravana is still alive under the crush of the mountain, and at any time can release his spirit to wreak havoc in the world.

Several years later after Rama died, Ravana&#x27;s spirit escaped from Mount Pati and went to Sumatra Island to seek the reincarnation of Sita, namely Subhadra, Krishna&#x27;s sister. Krishna himself is the reincarnation of Rama. Hanoman chases and meets Bima, his younger brother and Bayu&#x27;s adopted son. Hanuman then served Krishna. He also managed to capture the spirit of Ravana and imprisoned him in Mount Kendalisada. On the mountain Hanoman acts as a hermit.

Unlike the original version, Hanoman in the wayang has two children. The first is named Trigangga who is in the form of a white ape like himself. It is said that when he came home from burning Alengka, Hanoman had the image of Trijata&#x27;s face, Wibisana&#x27;s daughter, who took care of Sita. Over the ocean, Hanuman&#x27;s semen fell and caused the seawater to boil. Unbeknownst to him, Baruna created the foam into Trigangga. Trigangga immediately grew up and met Bukbis, the son of Ravana. The two are friends and sided with Alengka against Rama. In the war Trigangga managed to kidnap Rama and Laksmana but was chased by Hanoman. Narada came down to intervene and explained the blood relationship between the two white monkeys. Finally, Trigangga turned against Ravana.

Hanuman&#x27;s second son was named Purwaganti, who had only appeared in the Pandavas era. He was credited with finding Yudhisthira&#x27;s lost heirloom named Kalimasada. Purwaganti was born to a priest&#x27;s daughter whom Hanoman married, named Purwati. Hanuman lived so long that he was tired of living. Narada descends to grant his wish, which is to die, as long as he can complete the final task, which is to reconcile the six descendants of Arjuna who are involved in a civil war. Hanoman disguised himself as Resi Mayangkara and succeeded in marrying Astradarma, son of Sariwahana, to Pramesti, daughter of Jayabaya. The Sariwahana family and Jayabaya were involved in a dispute even though they were both descendants of Arjuna. Hanoman then appeared to face Jayabaya&#x27;s enemy named Yaksadewa, the king of Selahuma. In that war, Hanuman died, moksha with his body, while Yaksadewa returned to his original form, namely Batara Kala, the god of death.

=== Thailand ===

Hanuman plays a significantly more prominent role in the &quot;Ramakien&quot;. In contrast to the strict devoted lifestyle to Rama of his Indian counterpart, Hanuman is known in Thailand as a promiscuous and flirtatious figure. One famous episode of the &quot;Ramakien&quot; has him fall in love with the mermaid Suvannamaccha and fathering Macchanu with her. In another, Hanuman takes on the form of Ravana and sleeps with Mandodari, Ravana&#x27;s consort, thus destroying her chastity, which was the last protection for Ravana&#x27;s life.

As in the Indian tradition, Hanuman is the patron of martial arts and an example of courage, fortitude and excellence in Thailand. He is depicted as wearing a crown on his head and armor. He is depicted as an albino with a strong character, open mouth, and sometimes is shown carrying a trident.

Hanuman is the mascot of the 1st Asian Martial Arts Games in Bangkok, Thailand.

==Lineage==
Though Hanuman is described to be celibate in the Ramayana and most of the Puranas, according to some regional sources, Hanuman married Suvarchala, the daughter of Surya (Sun-God).

However, once Hanuman was flying above the seas to go to Lanka, a drop of his sweat fell in the mouth of a crocodile, which eventually turned into a baby. The monkey baby was delivered by the crocodile, who was soon retrieved by Ahiravana, and raised by him, named Makardhwaja, and made the guard of the gates of Patala, the former&#x27;s kingdom. One day, Hanuman, when going to save Rama and Lakshmana from Ahiravana, faced Makardhwaja and defeated him in combat. Later, after knowing the reality and after saving him, he made his son the king of Patala.

The Jethwa clan claims to be a descendant of Makardhwaja, and, according to them, he had a son named Modh-dhwaja, who in turn had a son named Jeth-dhwaja, hence the name of the clan.

==In popular culture==
While Hanuman is a quintessential character of any movie on Ramayana, Hanuman-centric movies have also been produced with Hanuman as the central character. In 1976 the first biopic movie on Hanuman in Hindi was released with wrestler Dara Singh playing the role of Hanuman. He again reprised the character in Ramanand Sagar&#x27;s television series Ramayan and B. R. Chopra&#x27;s Mahabharat. The TV series Jai Hanuman was released in 1997 on Doordarshan.

In 2005 an animated movie of the same name was released and was extremely popular among children. Actor Mukesh Khanna voiced the character of Hanuman in the film. Following this several series of movies featuring the god were produced, though all of them were animated, prominent ones being the Bal Hanuman series 2006–2012. Another movie, Maruti Mera dost, (2009) was a contemporary adaptation of Hanuman in modern times.

The 2015 Bollywood movie Bajrangi Bhaijaan had Salman Khan playing the role of Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi, who is an ardent Hanuman devotee and regularly invokes him for his protection, courage, and strength.

US president Barack Obama had a habit of carrying with him a few small items given to him by people he had met. The items included a small figurine of Hanuman.

Hanuman was referenced in the 2018 Marvel Cinematic Universe film, &quot;Black Panther&quot; and its 2022 sequel &quot;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&quot;, which are set in the fictional African nation of Wakanda; the Jabari tribe often is seen saying &quot;Glory to &quot;Hanuman&quot; &quot; as the tribe worships its ancestral gorilla deity. The reference was removed from the film in theatre screenings in India. But the uncensored part came out later on digital streaming platforms in the country.

The Mexican acoustic-metal duo, Rodrigo Y Gabriela released a hit single named &quot;Hanuman&quot; from their album &quot;11:11&quot;. Each song on the album was made to pay tribute to a different musician that inspired the band, and the song Hanuman is dedicated to Carlos Santana. Why the band used the name Hanuman is unclear, but the artists have stated that Santana &quot;was a role model for musicians back in Mexico that it was possible to do great music and be an international musician.&quot;

Hanuman is the protagonist in the 2022 film &quot;Hanuman White Monkey&quot;, a fantasy film that combines special effects with a &quot;Khon&quot; (Thai masked pantomime) performance style. In the 2022 action-adventure &quot;Ram Setu&quot;, it is implied that the character &quot;AP&quot; is actually Hanuman. In 2024, Telugu film director Prasanth Varma directed the film &quot;Hanu-Man&quot;, a superhero film based on Hanuman&#x27;s power. The film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Jai Hanuman&quot;, is set to be released during the Sankranti of 2025 and would directly show Hanuman keeping his promise to Rama.

== Literature ==
The Sapta Chiranjivi Stotram is a mantra that is featured in Hindu literature:

The mantra states that the remembrance of the eight immortals (Ashwatthama, Mahabali, Vyasa, Hanuman, Vibhishana, Kripa, Parashurama, and Markandeya) offers one freedom from ailments and longevity.

<text>In the United Kingdom, a scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change.

The various pieces of legislation that legally protect heritage assets from damage and destruction are grouped under the term &quot;designation&quot;. The protection provided to scheduled monuments is given under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, which is a different law from that used for listed buildings (which fall within the town and country planning system). A heritage asset is a part of the historic environment that is valued because of its historic, archaeological, architectural or artistic interest. Only some of these are judged to be important enough to have extra legal protection through designation.

There are about 20,000 scheduled monuments in England representing about 37,000 heritage assets. Of the tens of thousands of scheduled monuments in the UK, most are inconspicuous archaeological sites, but some are large ruins. According to the 1979 Act, a monument cannot be a structure which is occupied as a dwelling, used as a place of worship or a protected shipwreck.

==The legislation relevant to scheduled monuments==
Scheduled monuments are defined in the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. In England, Wales and Scotland they are often referred to as a scheduled ancient monument, although the Act defines only ancient monument and scheduled monument. A monument can be:
* A building or structure, cave or excavation which is above or below the surface of the land; or on / under the sea bed within UK territorial waters (or a site that contains the remains of one).
* A site comprising any vehicle, vessel, aircraft or other moveable structure (or contains the remains of one).

In Northern Ireland they are designated under separate legislation and are referred to as a scheduled historic monument (for those in private ownership) or a monument in state care (for those in public ownership).

==History==
The first Act to enshrine legal protection for ancient monuments was the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882. This identified an initial list of 68 prehistoric sites that were given a degree of legal protection (25 sites in England, three in Wales, 22 in Scotland and 18 in Ireland). This was the result of strenuous representation by William Morris and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, which had been founded in 1877. Following various previous attempts, the 1882 legislation was guided through Parliament by John Lubbock, who in 1871 had bought Avebury, Wiltshire, to ensure the survival of the stone circle.

The first Inspector of Ancient Monuments, as set up by the act, was Augustus Pitt Rivers. At this point, only the inspector, answering directly to the First Commissioner of Works, was involved in surveying the scheduled sites and persuading landowners to offer sites to the state. The act also established the concept of guardianship, in which a site might remain in private ownership, but the monument itself become the responsibility of the state, as guardian. However the legislation could not compel landowners, as that level of state interference with private property was not politically possible. The Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900 extended the scope of the legislation to include medieval monuments. Pressure grew for stronger legislation. In a speech in 1907, Robert Hunter, chairman of the National Trust, observed that only a further 18 sites had been added to the original list of 68. &#x27;Scheduling&#x27; in the modern sense only became possible with the passing of the Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913.

When Pitt Rivers died in 1900 he was not immediately replaced as Inspector. Charles Peers, a professional architect, was appointed as Inspector in 1910 in the Office of Works becoming Chief Inspector in 1913. The job title &#x27;Inspector&#x27; is still in use.

==The process for designating a scheduled monument==
Scheduling offers protection because it makes it illegal to undertake a great range of &#x27;works&#x27; within a designated area, without first obtaining &#x27;scheduled monument consent&#x27;. However, it does not affect the owner&#x27;s freehold title or other legal interests in the land, nor does it give the general public any new rights of public access. The process of scheduling does not automatically imply that the monument is being poorly managed or that it is under threat, nor does it impose a legal obligation to undertake any additional management of the monument.

In England and Wales the authority for designating, re-designating and de-designating a scheduled monument lies with the Secretary of State for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). The Secretary of State keeps the list, or schedule, of these sites.

The designation process was first devolved to Scotland and Wales in the 1970s and is now operated there by the Scottish Government and the Welsh Government respectively. The government bodies with responsibility for archaeology and the historic environment in Britain are: Historic England in England, Cadw in Wales, and Historic Environment Scotland in Scotland. The processes for application and monitoring scheduled monuments is administered in England by Historic England; in Wales by Cadw on behalf of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament); and in Scotland by Historic Environment Scotland on behalf of the Scottish Ministers.

In Northern Ireland, the term &quot;Scheduled Historic Monument&quot; is used. These sites protected under Article 3 of the Historic Monuments and Archaeological Objects (Northern Ireland) Order 1995. The schedule contains over 1,900 sites, and is maintained by the Department for Communities.

==Heritage protection legislation for scheduled monuments==

There is no positive distinction yet for a single method of registering sites of heritage. The long tradition of legal issues did not lead to a condensed register nor to any single authority to take care of over the course of the last 130 years.

The UK is a signatory to the Council of Europe&#x27;s Valletta Treaty which obliges it to have a legal system to protect archaeological heritage on land and under water. The body of designation legislation used for legally protecting heritage assets from damage and destruction is complex, and dates back to 1882. There have been many revisions since, and the UK government states that it remains committed to heritage protection legislation reform, even though the draft Heritage Protection Bill 2008, which proposed a single &#x27;register&#x27; that included scheduled monuments and listed buildings, was abandoned to make room in the parliamentary legislative programme for measures to deal with the credit crunch.

The scheduling system has been criticised by some as being cumbersome. In England and Wales it also has a limited definition of what constitutes a monument. Features such as ritual landscapes, battlefields and flint scatters are difficult to schedule; recent amendment in Scotland (see below) has widened the definition to include &quot;any site... comprising any thing, or group of things, that evidences previous human activity&quot;.

The wide range of legislation means that the terminology describing how historic sites are protected varies according to the type of heritage asset. Monuments are &quot;scheduled&quot;, buildings are &quot;listed&quot;, whilst battlefields, parks and gardens are &quot;registered&quot;, and historic wrecks are &quot;protected&quot;. Historic urban spaces receive protection through designation as &quot;conservation areas&quot;, and historic landscapes are designated through national park and Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) legislation. In addition, there are areas in the UK are also protected as World Heritage Sites.

To add to the confusion, some heritage assets can be both listed buildings and scheduled monuments (e.g. Dunblane Cathedral). World Heritage Sites, conservation areas and protected landscapes can also contain both scheduled monuments and listed buildings. Where a heritage asset is both scheduled and listed, many provisions of the listing legislation are dis-applied (for example those relating to building preservation notices).

In England, Scotland and Wales, protection of monuments can also be given by another process, additional to or separate from scheduling, taking the monument into state ownership or placing it under guardianship, classifying it as a guardianship monument under the terms of Section 12 of the 1979 Act (as amended by the National Heritage Act 1983 in England, and by the Historic Environment (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2011) (e.g. St Rule&#x27;s Church in St Andrews). The latter meaning that the owner retains possession, while the appropriate national heritage body maintains it and (usually) opens it to the public. All monuments in guardianship on the passing of the 1979 Act were automatically included in the &#x27;schedule&#x27;.

Scheduling is not usually applied to underwater sites although historic wrecks can be protected under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973, although three maritime sites have been designated as scheduled monuments. In Scotland new powers for protection of the marine heritage, better integrated with other maritime conservation powers, have been given by the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010. It is intended that the marine scheduled monuments will be protected by this new Act. The Historic Environment (Amendment) (Scotland) Act, which amended the 1979 Act, was passed into law in 2011.

Wider areas can be protected by designating their locations as Areas of Archaeological Importance (AAI) under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. As of 2011, only five city centres in England have been designated as AAIs (Canterbury, Chester, Exeter, Hereford and York). This part of the 1979 Act was never brought into effect in Scotland.

==The schedules==
It is a legal requirement to maintain the &#x27;schedule&#x27; of monuments. In England the Department for Culture, Media and Sport keeps a register, or schedule, of nationally important sites which receive state protection. The National Heritage List for England now includes about 400,000 heritage sites, including scheduled monuments. This online searchable list can be found on the Historic England web site. The list of Scottish monuments can be searched on the Historic Environment Scotland website, or through Pastmap. For Wales, the National Monuments Record of Wales (NMRW), has an online database called &quot;Coflein&quot; which contains the national collection of information about the historic environment of Wales.

==Criteria for scheduling==
To be eligible for scheduling, a monument must be demonstrably of (in the terms of the 1979 Act) &quot;national importance&quot;. Non-statutory criteria are provided to guide the assessment. In England these are:
* Period – meaning the length of time it remained in use; significant sites are often multi-period
* Rarity – monuments with few known comparators are more likely to be scheduled
* Documentation – information from earlier investigations at a site can inform on its significance
* Group value – where a monument forms part of a wider geographical landscape of important sites
* Survival/condition – the degree to which the surviving remains convey the size, shape and function of the site
* Fragility/vulnerability – threats to the site from natural agencies, tourism or development can lead to a monument being scheduled for its protection
* Representativity – how well the monument represents diverse similar types and/or whether it contains unique features
* Potential – its ability to contribute to our knowledge through further study.

The Scottish criteria were revised after public consultation between 2006 and 2008.

There is no appeal against the scheduling process and adding a monument to the schedule may be a process requiring a great deal of research and consideration. The process can be accelerated for sites under threat, however. In England, Historic England gathers information on a site, defines a boundary around it and advises the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport of its eligibility for inclusion on the schedule. In Wales Cadw is part of central government and act on behalf of the relevant ministers. In Scotland, since October 2015, Historic Environment Scotland has been a non-departmental public body advising Scottish Ministers.

==Legal protection for scheduled monuments==

The 1979 Act makes it a criminal offence to:
* Destroy or damage a scheduled monument
* Do any &quot;works&quot; which would demolish, damage, remove, repair, add or alter it (including agriculture, forestry, flooding and tipping) without previous permission from the Secretary of State or devolved equivalent, given through formal written &quot;scheduled monument consent&quot;
* Use a metal detector without prior consent
* Remove any historic or archaeological object from the site without prior consent.

Despite perceptions to the contrary, only a very small proportion of applications for scheduled monument consent are refused. In Scotland in the ten years from 1995 to 2005, out of 2,156 applications, only 16 were refused. Development close to a scheduled monument which might damage its setting is also a material consideration in the planning system.

==Management of scheduled monuments==
Historic England, Historic Environment Scotland and Cadw monitor the condition of scheduled monuments. They encourage owners to maintain scheduled monuments in good condition by using sympathetic land uses, for example restricting stock levels or controlling undergrowth which can damage archaeology below ground.

Historic Environment Scotland, Cadw, Historic England and Natural England also offer owners advice on how to manage their monuments. There are some grant incentive schemes for owners, including schemes run by Historic England and by Natural England for farmers and land managers.

Historic Environment Scotland, Historic England and Cadw, occasionally award grants to support management agreements for monuments, and in some cases can help with major repairs.

In England, the condition of scheduled monuments is also reported through the Heritage at Risk survey. In 2008 this survey extended to include all listed buildings, scheduled monuments, registered parks and gardens, registered battlefields, protected wreck sites and conservation areas. The register is compiled by survey by a range of heritage groups including Natural England, the Forestry Commission, local authorities, national park authorities, the National Trust, regional and local archaeological societies, Portable Antiquities Scheme Finds Liaison Officers, voluntary groups, property owners, land managers and farmers.

<doc id="100241" wikidata="Q476824" url="?curid=100241" title="Kalki">
<text>Kalki (), also called Kalkin, is the prophesied tenth and final incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu. According to Vaishnava cosmology, Kalki is destined to appear at the end of the Kali Yuga, the last of the four ages in the cycle of existence (&quot;Krita&quot;). His arrival will mark the end of the Kali Yuga and herald the beginning of the Satya Yuga, the most virtuous age, before the ultimate dissolution of the universe (Mahapralaya).

In the Puranas, Kalki is depicted as the avatar who will rejuvenate existence by ending the darkest period of adharma (unrighteousness) and restoring dharma (righteousness). He is described as riding a white horse named Devadatta and wielding a fiery sword. The portrayal of Kalki varies across different Puranas, and his narrative is also found in other traditions, including the Kalachakra-Tantra of Tibetan Buddhism and Sikh texts.

==Etymology==
The name Kalki is derived from &quot;Kal&quot;, which means &quot;time&quot; (Kali Yuga). The original term may have been Karki (&quot;white&quot;, from the horse) which morphed into Kalki. This proposal is supported by two versions of &quot;Mahabharata&quot; manuscripts (e.g. the G3.6 manuscript) that have been found, where the Sanskrit verses name the incarnation to be Karki.

==Description==
===Hindu texts===
Kalki is an &quot;avatara&quot; of Vishnu. Avatar means &quot;descent&quot;, and refers to a descent of the divine into the material realm of human existence. Kalki appears for the first time in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

The Garuda Purana lists ten incarnations, with Kalki being the final one. He is described as the incarnation who appears at the end of the Kali Yuga. He ends the darkest, degenerating, and chaotic stage of the Kali Yuga to remove &quot;adharma&quot; and ushers in the Satya Yuga, while riding a white horse with a fiery sword. He restarts a new cycle of time. He is described as a Brahmin warrior in the Puranas. It is mentioned in the Puranas that the immortal Chiranjivis will assist him in various stages of his life.

A minor text named Kalki Purana is a relatively recent text, likely composed in Bengal. Its dating floruit is the 18th-century. Wendy Doniger dates the Kalki Mythology containing &quot;Kalki Purana&quot; to between 1500 and 1700 CE.

In the &quot;Kalki Purana&quot;, Kalki is born into the family of Vishnuyashas and Sumati, in a village called Shambala, on the thirteenth day during the fortnight of the waxing moon. At a young age, he is taught the holy scriptures on topics such as &quot;dharma, karma, artha, jñāna,&quot; and undertakes military training under the care of the Parashurama (the sixth incarnation of Vishnu). Soon, Kalki worships Shiva, who gets pleased by the devotion and provides him in return a divine white horse named Devadatta (a manifestation of Garuda), a powerful sword, whereby its handle is bedecked with jewels, and a parrot named Shuka, who is an all-knower; the past, the present and the future. Other accessories are also given by other devas, devis, saints, and righteous kings. He fights an evil army and in many wars, ending evil, but does not end existence. Kalki returns to Shambala, inaugurates a new &quot;Yuga&quot; for the good, and then goes to Vaikuntha. In the &quot;Kalki Purana&quot;, there is a mention of a Buddhist city whose residents don&#x27;t adhere to &quot;dharma&quot; (not worshipping the devas, ancestors, and not upholding the varna system), which Kalki fights and conquers.

The &quot;Agni Purana&quot; describes Kalki&#x27;s role:
The &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot; features the devas hailing Vishnu, invoking his Kalki avatara:
===Buddhist texts===

In the Buddhist Text &quot;Kalachakra Tantra&quot;, the righteous kings are called Kalki (Kalkin, lit. chieftain) living in Sammu. There are many Kalki in this text, each fighting barbarism, persecution and chaos. The last Kalki is called &quot;Rudra Cakrin&quot; and is predicted to end the chaos and degeneration by assembling a large army to eradicate a barbarian army. A great war, which will include an army of both Hindus and Buddhists, will destroy the barbaric forces, states the text. This is most likely borrowed from Hinduism to Buddhism due to the arrival of Islamic kingdoms from the west to the east, mainly settled in West Tibet, Central Asia and the Indian Subcontinent. According to Donald Lopez – a professor of Buddhist Studies, Kalki is predicted to start the new cycle of perfect era where &quot;Buddhism will flourish, people will live long, happy lives and righteousness will reign supreme&quot;. The text is significant in establishing the chronology of the Kalki idea to be from post-7th century, probably the 9th or 10th century. Lopez states that the Buddhist text likely borrowed it from Hindu vedic texts. Other scholars, such as Yijiu Jin, state that the text originated in Central Asia in the 10th-century, and Tibetan literature picked up a version of it in India around 1027 CE.

===Sikh texts===
The Kalki incarnation appears in the historic Sikh Texts, most notably in Dasam Granth, a text that is traditionally attributed to Guru Gobind Singh. The &quot;Chaubis Avatar&quot; (24 incarnations) section mentions Sage Matsyanra describing the appearance of Vishnu incarnations to fight evil, greed, violence and ignorance. It includes Kalki as the twenty-fourth incarnation to lead the war between the forces of righteousness and unrighteousness.

== Development ==

While there is no mention of Kalki in the Vedic literature, the epithet &quot;Kalmallkinam&quot;, meaning &quot;Brilliant Remover Of Darkness&quot;, is found in the Vedic Literature for Rudra (later Shiva), has been interpreted to be &quot;Forerunner Of Kalki&quot;.

Kalki appears for the first time in the great war epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. The mention of Kalki in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; occurs only once, over the verses 3.188.85–3.189.6. The Kalki incarnation is found in the Maha Puranas such as &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, &quot;Matsya Purana&quot;, and the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;. However, the details relating the Kalki mythologies are divergent between the epic and the Puranas, as well as within the Puranas.

In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, according to Hiltebeitel, Kalki is an extension of the Parashurama incarnation legend, where a Brahmin warrior destroys Kshatriyas who were abusing their power to spread chaos, evil, and the persecution of the powerless. The epic character of Kalki restores dharma, restores justice in the world, but does not end the cycle of existence. The Kalkin section in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; is present in the Markandeya section. There, states Luis Reimann, can &quot;hardly be any doubt that the Markandeya section is a late addition to the epic. Making Yudhishthira ask a question about conditions at the end of Kali and the beginning of Krta — something far removed from his own situation — is merely a device for justifying the inclusion of this subject matter in the epic.&quot;

According to Cornelia Dimmitt, the &quot;clear and tidy&quot; systematization of Kalki and the remaining nine incarnations of Vishnu is not found in any of the Maha Puranas. The coverage of Kalki in these Hindu texts is scant, in contrast to the legends of Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Vamana, Narasimha, and Krishna, all of whom are repeatedly and extensively described. According to Dimmitt, this was likely because just like the concept of the Buddha as a Vishnu Incarnation, the concept of Kalki was &quot;somewhat in flux&quot; when the major Puranas were being compiled.

This Kalki concept may have further developed in the Hindu texts both as a reaction to the invasions of the Indian subcontinent by various armies over the centuries from its northwest, and in reaction to the mythologies these invaders brought with them. Similarly, the Buddhist Literature dated to the late 1st millennium, a future Buddha Maitreya is depicted as Kalki. According to John Mitchiner, the Kalki concept owes &quot;in some measure&quot; to Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian and other concepts. Mitchiner states that some Puranas such as the Yuga Purana do not mention Kalki and offer a different cosmology than the other Puranas. The Yuga Purana mythologizes in greater details the post-Maurya era Indo-Greek and Saka era, while the Manvantara theme containing the Kalki idea is mythologized greater in other Puranas. Luis Gonzales-Reimann concurs with Mitchiner, stating that the Yuga Purana does not mention Kalki. In other texts such as the sections 2.36 and 2.37 of the Vayu Purana, states Reimann, it is not Kalkin who ends the Kali Yuga, but a different character named Pramiti. Most historians, states Arvind Sharma, link the development of Kalki mythology in Hinduism to the suffering caused by foreign invasions. Unlike other messianic concepts, Kalki&#x27;s purpose is to destroy the invaders and heretics in order to reverse the current age Kali Yuga, the age of evil.

===Predictions about birth and arrival===

In the Cyclic Concept Of Time (&quot;Puranic Kalpa&quot;), &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; is estimated to last 432,000 years. In some Vaishnava texts, Kalki is forecasted to appear on a white horse on the day of &quot;pralaya&quot; to end &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;, to end the evil and wickedness, and to recreate the world anew along with A New Cycle Of Time (Yuga).

Kalki&#x27;s description varies with manuscripts. Some state Kalki will be born to Awejsirdenee and Bishenjun, others in the family of Sumati and Vishnuyasha. In Buddhist manuscripts, Vishnuyasha is stated to be a prominent headman of the village called Shambhala. He will become the king, a &quot;Turner Of The Wheel&quot;, and one who triumphs. He will eliminate all barbarians and robbers, end &quot;adharma&quot;, restart &quot;dharma&quot;, and save the good people. After that, humanity will be transformed and the golden age will begin state the Hindu manuscripts.

In the Kanchipuram temple, two relief Puranic panels depict Kalki, one relating to lunar (moon-based) dynasty as mother of Kalki and another to solar (sun-based) dynasty as father of Kalki. In these panels, states D.D. Hudson, the story depicted is in terms of Kalki fighting and defeating asura Kali. He rides a white horse called Devadatta, ends evil, purifies everyone&#x27;s minds and consciousness, and heralds the start of Satya Yuga.

<text>An Internet service provider (ISP) is an organization that provides myriad services related to accessing, using, managing, or participating in the Internet. ISPs can be organized in various forms, such as commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned.

Internet services typically provided by ISPs can include internet access, internet transit, domain name registration, web hosting, and colocation.

==History==
The Internet (originally ARPAnet) was developed as a network between government research laboratories and participating departments of universities. Other companies and organizations joined by direct connection to the backbone, or by arrangements through other connected companies, sometimes using dialup tools such as UUCP. By the late 1980s, a process was set in place towards public, commercial use of the Internet. Some restrictions were removed by 1991, shortly after the introduction of the World Wide Web.

During the 1980s, online service providers such as CompuServe, Prodigy, and America Online (AOL) began to offer limited capabilities to access the Internet, such as e-mail interchange, but full access to the Internet was not readily available to the general public.

In 1989, the first Internet service providers, companies offering the public direct access to the Internet for a monthly fee, were established in Australia and the United States. In Brookline, Massachusetts, The World became the first commercial ISP in the US. Its first customer was served in November 1989. These companies generally offered dial-up connections, using the public telephone network to provide last-mile connections to their customers. The barriers to entry for dial-up ISPs were low and many providers emerged.

However, cable television companies and the telephone carriers already had wired connections to their customers and could offer Internet connections at much higher speeds than dial-up using broadband technology such as cable modems and digital subscriber line (DSL). As a result, these companies often became the dominant ISPs in their service areas, and what was once a highly competitive ISP market became effectively a monopoly or duopoly in countries with a commercial telecommunications market, such as the United States.

In 1995, NSFNET was decommissioned removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic and network access points were created to allow peering arrangements between commercial ISPs.

===Net neutrality===

On 23 April 2014, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was reported to be considering a new rule permitting ISPs to offer content providers a faster track to send content, thus reversing their earlier net neutrality position. A possible solution to net neutrality concerns may be municipal broadband, according to Professor Susan Crawford, a legal and technology expert at Harvard Law School. On 15 May 2014, the FCC decided to consider two options regarding Internet services: first, permit fast and slow broadband lanes, thereby compromising net neutrality; and second, reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service, thereby preserving net neutrality. On 10 November 2014, President Barack Obama recommended that the FCC reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality. On 16 January 2015, Republicans presented legislation, in the form of a U.S. Congress H.R. discussion draft bill, that makes concessions to net neutrality but prohibits the FCC from accomplishing the goal or enacting any further regulation affecting Internet service providers. On 31 January 2015, AP News reported that the FCC will present the notion of applying (&quot;with some caveats&quot;) Title II (common carrier) of the Communications Act of 1934 to the Internet in a vote expected on 26 February 2015. Adoption of this notion would reclassify Internet service from one of information to one of the telecommunications and, according to Tom Wheeler, chairman of the FCC, ensure net neutrality. The FCC was expected to enforce net neutrality in its vote, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

On 26 February 2015, the FCC ruled in favor of net neutrality by adopting Title II (common carrier) of the Communications Act of 1934 and Section 706 in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to the Internet. The FCC Chairman, Tom Wheeler, commented, &quot;This is no more a plan to regulate the Internet than the First Amendment is a plan to regulate free speech. They both stand for the same concept.&quot; On 12 March 2015, the FCC released the specific details of the net neutrality rules. On 13 April 2015, the FCC published the final rule on its new &quot;Net Neutrality&quot; regulations. These rules went into effect on 12 June 2015.

Upon becoming FCC chairman in April 2017, Ajit Pai proposed an end to net neutrality, awaiting votes from the commission. On 21 November 2017, Pai announced that a vote will be held by FCC members on 14 December 2017 on whether to repeal the policy. On 11 June 2018, the repeal of the FCC&#x27;s network neutrality rules took effect.

=== Provisions for low-income families ===
Since December 31, 2021, The Affordable Connectivity Program has given households in the U.S. at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines or households which meet a number of other criteria an up to $30 per month discount toward internet service, or up to $75 per month on certain tribal lands.

==Classifications==

===Access providers===
Access provider ISPs provide Internet access, employing a range of technologies to connect users to their network. Available technologies have ranged from computer modems with acoustic couplers to telephone lines, to television cable (CATV), Wi-Fi, and fiber optics.

For users and small businesses, traditional options include copper wires to provide dial-up, DSL, typically asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), cable modem or Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) (typically basic rate interface). Using fiber-optics to end users is called Fiber To The Home or similar names.

Customers with more demanding requirements (such as medium-to-large businesses, or other ISPs) can use higher-speed DSL (such as single-pair high-speed digital subscriber line), Ethernet, metropolitan Ethernet, gigabit Ethernet, Frame Relay, ISDN Primary Rate Interface, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and synchronous optical networking (SONET).

Wireless access is another option, including cellular and satellite Internet access. Access providers may have an MPLS (Multiprotocol label switching) or formerly a SONET backbone network, and have a ring or mesh network topology in their core network. The networks run by access providers can be considered wide area networks. ISPs can have access networks, aggregation networks/aggregation layers/distribution layers/edge routers/metro networks and a core network/backbone network; each subsequent network handles more traffic than the last. Mobile service providers also have similar networks.

===Mailbox providers===
A mailbox provider is an organization that provides services for hosting electronic mail domains with access to storage for mail boxes. It provides email servers to send, receive, accept, and store email for end users or other organizations.

Many mailbox providers are also access providers, while others are not (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, Outlook.com, AOL Mail, Po box). The definition given in RFC 6650 covers email hosting services, as well as the relevant department of companies, universities, organizations, groups, and individuals that manage their mail servers themselves. The task is typically accomplished by implementing Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and possibly providing access to messages through Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), the Post Office Protocol, Webmail, or a proprietary protocol.

===Hosting ISPs===
Internet hosting services provide email, web-hosting, or online storage services. Other services include virtual server, cloud services, or physical server operation.

===Transit ISPs===

Just as their customers pay them for Internet access, ISPs themselves pay upstream ISPs for Internet access. An upstream ISP such as a tier 2 or tier 1 ISP usually has a larger network than the contracting ISP or is able to provide the contracting ISP with access to parts of the Internet the contracting ISP by itself has no access to.

In the simplest case, a single connection is established to an upstream ISP and is used to transmit data to or from areas of the Internet beyond the home network; this mode of interconnection is often cascaded multiple times until reaching a tier 1 carrier. In reality, the situation is often more complex. ISPs with more than one point of presence (PoP) may have separate connections to an upstream ISP at multiple PoPs, or they may be customers of multiple upstream ISPs and may have connections to each one of them at one or more point of presence. Transit ISPs provide large amounts of bandwidth for connecting hosting ISPs and access ISPs.

Border Gateway Protocol is used by routers to connect to other networks, which are identified by their autonomous system number. Tier 2 ISPs depend on Tier 1 ISPs and often have their own networks, but must pay for transit or internet access to Tier 1 ISPs, but may peer or send transit without paying, to other Tier 2 and/or some Tier 1 ISPs. Tier 3 ISPs do not engage in peering and only purchase transit from Tier 2 and Tier 1 ISPs, and often specialize in offering internet service to end customers such as businesses and individuals. Some organizations act as their own ISPs and purchase transit directly from a Tier 1 ISP. Transit ISPs may use OTN (Optical transport network) or SDH/SONET (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy/Synchronous Optical Networking) with DWDM (Dense wavelength-division multiplexing) for transmitting data through optical fiber over long distances such as across a city or between cities. For transmissions in a metro area such as a city and for large customers such as data centers, special pluggable modules in routers, conforming to standards such as CFP, QSFP-DD, OSFP, 400ZR or OpenZR+ may be used alongside DWDM and many vendors have proprietary offerings. Long-haul networks transport data across longer distances than metro networks, such as through submarine cables, or connecting several metropolitan networks. Optical line systems and packet optical transport systems can also be used for data transmission in metro areas, long haul connections and data center interconnect. Ultra long haul transmission transports data over distances of over 1500 kilometers.

===Virtual ISPs===
A virtual ISP (VISP) is an operation that purchases services from another ISP, sometimes called a &quot;wholesale ISP&quot; in this context, which allow the VISP&#x27;s customers to access the Internet using services and infrastructure owned and operated by the wholesale ISP. VISPs resemble mobile virtual network operators and competitive local exchange carriers for voice communications.

===Free ISPs ===
Free ISPs are Internet service providers that provide service free of charge. Many free ISPs display advertisements while the user is connected; like commercial television, in a sense they are selling the user&#x27;s attention to the advertiser. Other free ISPs, sometimes called freenets, are run on a nonprofit basis, usually with volunteer staff.

===Wireless ISP===
A wireless Internet service provider (WISP) is an Internet service provider with a network based on wireless networking. Technology may include commonplace Wi-Fi wireless mesh networking, or proprietary equipment designed to operate over open 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 4.9, 5.2, 5.4, 5.7, and 5.8 GHz bands or licensed frequencies such as 2.5 GHz (EBS/BRS), 3.65 GHz (NN) and in the UHF band (including the MMDS frequency band) and LMDS.

=== ISPs in rural regions ===
It is hypothesized that the vast divide between broadband connection in rural and urban areas is partially caused by a lack of competition between ISPs in rural areas, where there exists a market typically controlled by just one provider. A lack of competition problematically causes subscription rates to rise disproportionately with the quality of service in rural areas, causing broadband connection to be unaffordable for some, even when the infrastructure supports service in a given area.

In contrast, consumers in urban areas typically benefit from lower rates and higher quality of broadband services, not only due to more advanced infrastructure but also the healthy economic competition caused by having several ISPs in a given area. How the difference in competition levels has potentially negatively affected the innovation and development of infrastructure in specific rural areas remains a question. The exploration and answers developed to the question could provide guidance for possible interventions and solutions meant to remedy the digital divide between rural and urban connectivity.

=== Satellite internet services ===

== Altnets ==
Altnets (portmanteau of &quot;alternative network provider&quot;) are localized broadband networks, typically formed as an alternative to monopolistic internet service providers within a region.

==Peering==
ISPs may engage in peering, where multiple ISPs interconnect at peering points or Internet exchange points (IXPs), allowing routing of data between each network, without charging one another for the data transmitted—data that would otherwise have passed through a third upstream ISP, incurring charges from the upstream ISP.

ISPs requiring no upstream and having only customers (end customers or peer ISPs) are called Tier 1 ISPs.

Network hardware, software and specifications, as well as the expertise of network management personnel are important in ensuring that data follows the most efficient route, and upstream connections work reliably. A tradeoff between cost and efficiency is possible.

Tier 1 ISPs are also interconnected with a mesh network topology. Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) are public locations where several networks are connected to each other. Public peering is done at IXPs, while private peering can be done with direct links between networks. IXPs or peering exchanges may be located in data centers.

==Law enforcement and intelligence assistance==
Internet service providers in many countries are legally required (e.g., via Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) in the U.S.) to allow law enforcement agencies to monitor some or all of the information transmitted by the ISP, or even store the browsing history of users to allow government access if needed (e.g. via the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 in the United Kingdom). Furthermore, in some countries ISPs are subject to monitoring by intelligence agencies. In the U.S., a controversial National Security Agency program known as PRISM provides for broad monitoring of Internet users traffic and has raised concerns about potential violation of the privacy protections in the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Modern ISPs integrate a wide array of surveillance and packet sniffing equipment into their networks, which then feeds the data to law-enforcement/intelligence networks (such as DCSNet in the United States, or SORM in Russia) allowing monitoring of Internet traffic in real time.

<text>The National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) was a program of coordinated, evolving projects sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) from 1985 to 1995 to promote advanced research and education networking in the United States. The program created several nationwide backbone computer networks in support of these initiatives. It was created to link researchers to the NSF-funded supercomputing centers. Later, with additional public funding and also with private industry partnerships, the network developed into a major part of the Internet backbone.

The National Science Foundation permitted only government agencies and universities to use the network until 1989 when the first commercial Internet service provider emerged. By 1991, the NSF removed access restrictions and the commercial ISP business grew rapidly.

==History==
Following the deployment of the Computer Science Network (CSNET), a network that provided Internet services to academic computer science departments, in 1981, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) aimed to create an academic research network facilitating access by researchers to the supercomputing centers funded by NSF in the United States.

In 1985, NSF began funding the creation of five new supercomputing centers:
* John von Neumann Center at Princeton University
* Cornell Theory Center at Cornell University
* Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC), a joint effort of Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Westinghouse
* National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign
* San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) on the campus of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD)

Also in 1985, under the leadership of Dennis Jennings, the NSF established the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET). NSFNET was to be a general-purpose research network, a hub to connect the five supercomputing centers along with the NSF-funded National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to each other and to the regional research and education networks that would in turn connect campus networks. Using this three tier network architecture NSFNET would provide access between the supercomputer centers and other sites over the backbone network at no cost to the centers or to the regional networks using the open TCP/IP protocols initially deployed successfully on the ARPANET.

===56kbit/s backbone===

The NSFNET initiated operations in 1986 using TCP/IP. Its six backbone sites were interconnected with leased 56-kbit/s links, built by a group including the University of Illinois National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), Cornell University Theory Center, University of Delaware, and Merit Network. PDP-11/73 minicomputers with routing and management software, called Fuzzballs, served as the network routers since they already implemented the TCP/IP standard.

This original 56kbit/s backbone was overseen by the supercomputer centers themselves with the lead taken by Ed Krol at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. PDP-11/73 Fuzzball routers were configured and run by Hans-Werner Braun at the Merit Network and statistics were collected by Cornell University.

Support for NSFNET end-users was provided by the NSF Network Service Center (NNSC), located at BBN Technologies and included publishing the softbound &quot;Internet Manager&#x27;s Phonebook&quot; which listed the contact information for every issued domain name and IP address in 1990. Incidentally, Ed Krol also authored the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Internet&quot; to help users of the NSFNET understand its capabilities. The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide became one of the first help manuals for the Internet.

As regional networks grew the 56kbit/s NSFNET backbone experienced rapid increases in network traffic and became seriously congested. In June 1987 NSF issued a new solicitation to upgrade and expand NSFNET.

===1.5Mbit/s (T-1) backbone===
As a result of a November 1987 NSF award to the Merit Network, a networking consortium by public universities in Michigan, the original 56kbit/s network was expanded to include 13 nodes interconnected at 1.5Mbit/s (T-1) by July 1988. Additional links were added to form a multi-path network, and a node located in Atlanta was added. Each of the backbone nodes was a router called the Nodal Switching System (NSS). The NSSes were a collection of multiple (typically nine) IBM RT PC systems connected by a Token Ring local area network. The RT PCs ran AOS, IBM&#x27;s version of Berkeley UNIX, and was dedicated to a particular packet processing task.

Under its cooperative agreement with NSF the Merit Network was the lead organization in a partnership that included IBM, MCI, and the State of Michigan. Merit provided overall project coordination, network design and engineering, a Network Operations Center (NOC), and information services to assist the regional networks. IBM provided equipment, software development, installation, maintenance and operations support. MCI provided the T-1 data circuits at reduced rates. The state of Michigan provided funding for facilities and personnel. Eric M. Aupperle, Merit&#x27;s President, was the NSFNET Project Director, and Hans-Werner Braun was Co-Principal Investigator.

From 1987 to 1994, Merit organized a series of &quot;Regional-Techs&quot; meetings, where technical staff from the regional networks met to discuss operational issues of common concern with each other and the Merit engineering staff.

During this period, but separate from its support for the NSFNET backbone, NSF funded:
* the NSF Connections Program that helped colleges and universities obtain or upgrade connections to regional networks;
* regional networks to obtain or upgrade equipment and data communications circuits;
* the NNSC, and successor Network Information Services Manager (aka InterNIC) information help desks;
* the International Connections Manager (ICM), a task performed by Sprint, that encouraged connections between the NSFNET backbone and international research and education networks; and
* various ad hoc grants to organizations such as the Federation of American Research Networks (FARNET).

The NSFNET became the principal Internet backbone starting in the Summer of 1986, when MIDnet, the first NSFNET regional backbone network became operational. By 1988, in addition to the five NSF supercomputer centers, NSFNET included connectivity to the regional networks BARRNet, JVNCNet, Merit/MichNet, MIDnet, NCAR, NorthWestNet, NYSERNet, SESQUINET, SURAnet, and Westnet, which in turn connected about 170 additional networks to the NSFNET. Three new nodes were added as part of the upgrade to T-3: NEARNET in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Argone National Laboratory outside of Chicago; and SURAnet in Atlanta, Georgia. NSFNET connected to other federal government networks including the NASA Science Internet, the Energy Science Network (ESnet), and others. 

Connections were also established to research and education networks in other countries starting in 1988 with Canada, France, NORDUnet (serving Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden), the Netherlands, and many other countries in subsequent years.

Two Federal Internet Exchanges (FIXes) were established in June 1989 under the auspices of the Federal Engineering Planning Group (FEPG). FIX East, at the University of Maryland in College Park and FIX West, at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. The existence of NSFNET and the FIXes allowed the ARPANET to be phased out in mid-1990.

Starting in August 1990 the NSFNET backbone supported the OSI Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP) in addition to TCP/IP. However, CLNP usage remained low when compared to TCP/IP.

Traffic on the network continued its rapid growth, doubling every seven months. Projections indicated that the T-1 backbone would become overloaded sometime in 1990.

A critical routing technology, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), originated during this period of Internet history. BGP allowed routers on the NSFNET backbone to differentiate routes originally learned via multiple paths. Prior to BGP, interconnection between IP network was inherently hierarchical, and careful planning was needed to avoid routing loops. BGP turned the Internet into a meshed topology, moving away from the centric architecture which the ARPANET emphasized.

During 1991, an upgraded backbone built with 45Mbit/s (T-3) transmission circuits was deployed to interconnect 16 nodes. The routers on the upgraded backbone were IBM RS/6000 servers running AIX UNIX. Core nodes were located at MCI facilities with end nodes at the connected regional networks and supercomputing centers. Completed in November 1991, the transition from T-1 to T-3 did not go as smoothly as the previous transition from 56kbit/s DDS to 1.5 mbit/s T-1, as it took longer than planned. As a result, there was at times serious congestion on the overloaded T-1 backbone. Following the transition to T-3, portions of the T-1 backbone were left in place to act as a backup for the new T-3 backbone.

In anticipation of the T-3 upgrade and the approaching end of the 5-year NSFNET cooperative agreement, in September 1990 Merit, IBM, and MCI formed Advanced Network and Services (ANS), a new non-profit corporation with a more broadly based Board of Directors than the Michigan-based Merit Network. Under its cooperative agreement with NSF, Merit remained ultimately responsible for the operation of NSFNET, but subcontracted much of the engineering and operations work to ANS. Both IBM and MCI made substantial new financial and other commitments to help support the new venture. Allan Weis left IBM to become ANS&#x27;s first President and Managing Director. Douglas Van Houweling, former Chair of the Merit Network Board and Vice Provost for Information Technology at the University of Michigan, was Chairman of the ANS Board of Directors.

The new T-3 backbone was named ANSNet and provided the physical infrastructure used by Merit to deliver the NSFNET Backbone Service.

==Regional networks==
In addition to the five NSF supercomputer centers (which operated regional networks, e.g., SDSCnet and NCSAnet), NSFNET provided connectivity to eleven regional networks and through these networks to many smaller regional and campus networks. The NSFNET regional networks were:
*BARRNet, the Bay Area Regional Research Network in Palo Alto, California;
*CERFnet, California Education and Research Federation Network in San Diego, California, serving California and Nevada;
*CICNet, the Committee on Institutional Cooperation Network via the Merit Network in Ann Arbor, Michigan and later as part of the T-3 upgrade via Argonne National Laboratory outside of Chicago, serving the Big Ten Universities and the University of Chicago in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin; 
*JVNCNet, the John von Neumann National Supercomputer Center Network in Princeton, New Jersey, connected the universities that made up the Consortium for Scientific Computing as well as a few New Jersey Universities. There were 1.5Mbit/s (T-1) links to Princeton University, Rutgers University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Brown University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Pittsburgh, Yale University, The Institute for Advanced Study, Pennsylvania State University, Rochester Institute of Technology, New York University, The University of Colorado and The University of Arizona. 
*Merit/MichNet in Ann Arbor, Michigan serving Michigan, formed in 1966, still in operation as of 2013;
*MIDnet in Lincoln, Nebraska the first NSFNET regional backbone to become operational in the Summer of 1986, serving Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and South Dakota, later acquired by Global Internet, which was acquired by Verio, Inc.;
*NEARNET, the New England Academic and Research Network in Cambridge, Massachusetts, added as part of the upgrade to T-3, serving Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, established in late 1988, operated by BBN under contract to MIT, BBN assumed responsibility for NEARNET on 1 July 1993;
*NorthWestNet in Seattle, Washington, serving Alaska, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, and Washington, founded in 1987; Currently being used by Ziply Fiber
*NYSERNet, New York State Education and Research Network in Ithaca, New York;
*SESQUINET, the Sesquicentennial Network in Houston, Texas, founded during the 150th anniversary of the State of Texas;
*SURAnet, the Southeastern Universities Research Association network in College Park, Maryland and later as part of the T-3 upgrade in Atlanta, Georgia serving Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, sold to BBN in 1994; and
*Westnet in Salt Lake City, Utah and Boulder, Colorado, serving Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.

==Commercial traffic==
The NSF&#x27;s appropriations act authorized NSF to &quot;foster and support the development and use of computer and other scientific and engineering methods and technologies, primarily for research and education in the sciences and engineering.&quot; This allowed NSF to support NSFNET and related networking initiatives, but only to the extent that that support was &quot;&quot;primarily for research and education in the sciences and engineering&quot;.&quot; And this in turn was taken to mean that use of NSFNET for commercial purposes was &quot;not&quot; allowed.

===Acceptable use policy===
To ensure that NSF support was used appropriately, NSF developed the &quot;NSFNET Acceptable Use Policy&quot; (AUP) that outlined in broad terms the uses of NSFNET that were and were not allowed. The AUP was revised several times to make it clearer and to allow the broadest possible use of NSFNET, consistent with Congress&#x27; wishes as expressed in the appropriations act.

A notable feature of the AUP is that it cites acceptable uses of the network that are not directly related to who or what type of organization is making that use. Use from for-profit organizations is acceptable when it is in support of open research and education. Additionally, some uses, such as fundraising, advertising, public relations activities, extensive personal or private use, for-profit consulting, and all illegal activities were never acceptable, even when that use is by a non-profit college, university, K-12 school, or library. While these AUP provisions seem reasonable, in some specific cases, they often proved difficult to interpret and enforce. NSF did not monitor the content of traffic that was sent over NSFNET or actively police the use of the network. Further, NSF did not require Merit or the regional networks to do so. NSF, Merit, and the regional networks did investigate possible cases of inappropriate use, when such use was brought to their attention.

An example may help to illustrate the problem. Is it acceptable for a parent to exchange e-mail with a child enrolled at a college or university, if that exchange uses the NSFNET backbone? It would be acceptable, if the subject of the e-mail was the student&#x27;s instruction or a research project. Even if the subject was not instruction or research, the e-mail still might be acceptable as private or personal business as long as the use was not extensive.

The prohibition on commercial use of the NSFNET backbone meant that some organizations could not connect to the Internet via regional networks that were connected to the NSFNET backbone, while to be fully connected other organizations (or regional networks on their behalf), including some non-profit research and educational institutions, would need to obtain two connections, one to an NSFNET attached regional network and one to a non-NSFNET attached network provider. In either case the situation was confusing and inefficient. It prevented economies of scale, increased costs, or both. And this slowed the growth of the Internet and its adoption by new classes of users, something no one was happy about.

In 1988, Vint Cerf, then at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI), proposed to the Federal Networking Council (FNC) and to MCI to interconnect the commercial MCI Mail system to NSFNET. MCI provided funding and FNC provided permission and in the summer of 1989, this linkage was made. In effect, the FNC permitted experimental use of the NSFNET backbone to carry commercial email traffic into and out of the NSFNET. Other email providers such as Telenet&#x27;s Telemail, Tymnet&#x27;s OnTyme and CompuServe also obtained permission to establish experimental gateways for the same purpose at about the same time. The interesting side effect of these links to NSFNET was that the users of the heretofore disconnected commercial email services were able to exchange email with one another via the Internet. Coincidentally, three commercial Internet service providers emerged in the same general time period: AlterNet (built by UUNET), PSINet and CERFnet.

===Commercial ISPs, ANS CO+RE, and the CIX===
During the period when NSFNET was being established, Internet service providers that allowed commercial traffic began to emerge, such as Alternet, PSINet, CERFNet, and others. The commercial networks in many cases were interconnected to the NSFNET and routed traffic over the NSFNET nominally accordingly to the NSFNET acceptable use policy Additionally, these early commercial networks often directly interconnected with each other as well as, on a limited basis, with some of the regional Internet networks.

In 1991, the Commercial Internet eXchange (CIX, pronounced &quot;kicks&quot;) was created by PSINet, UUNET and CERFnet to provide a location at which multiple networks could exchange traffic free from traffic-based settlements and restrictions imposed by an acceptable use policy.

In 1991, a new ISP, ANS CO+RE (commercial plus research), raised concerns and unique questions regarding commercial and non-commercial interoperability policies. ANS CO+RE was the for-profit subsidiary of the non-profit Advanced Network and Services (ANS) that had been created earlier by the NSFNET partners, Merit, IBM, and MCI. ANS CO+RE was created specifically to allow commercial traffic on ANSNet without jeopardizing its parent&#x27;s non-profit status or violating any tax laws. The NSFNET Backbone Service and ANS CO+RE both used and shared the common ANSNet infrastructure. NSF agreed to allow ANS CO+RE to carry commercial traffic subject to several conditions:
* that the NSFNET Backbone Service was not diminished;
* that ANS CO+RE recovered at least the average cost of the commercial traffic traversing the network; and
* that any excess revenues recovered above the cost of carrying the commercial traffic would be placed into an infrastructure pool to be distributed by an allocation committee broadly representative of the networking community to enhance and extend national and regional networking infrastructure and support.

For a time ANS CO+RE refused to connect to the CIX and the CIX refused to purchase a connection to ANS CO+RE. In May 1992 Mitch Kapor and Al Weis forged an agreement where ANS would connect to the CIX as a &quot;trial&quot; with the ability to disconnect at a moment&#x27;s notice and without the need to join the CIX as a member. This compromise resolved things for a time, but later the CIX started to block access from regional networks that had not paid the $10,000 fee to become members of the CIX.

Meanwhile, Congress passed its Scientific and Advanced-Technology Act of 1992 that formally permitted NSF to connect to commercial networks in support of research and education.

===An unfortunate state of affairs===
The creation of ANS CO+RE and its initial refusal to connect to the CIX was one of the factors that lead to the controversy described later in this article. Other issues had to do with:
* differences in the cultures of the non-profit research and education community and the for-profit community with ANS trying to be a member of both camps and not being fully accepted by either;
* differences of opinion about the best approach to take to open the Internet to commercial use and to maintain and encourage a fully interconnected Internet; and
* differences of opinion about the correct type and level of involvement in Internet networking initiatives by the public and the private sectors.

For a time this state of affairs kept the networking community as a whole from fully implementing the vision for the Internet as a worldwide network of fully interconnected TCP/IP networks allowing any connected site to communicate with any other connected site. These issues would not be fully resolved until a new network architecture was developed and the NSFNET Backbone Service was turned off in 1995.

==Privatization and a new network architecture==
The NSFNET Backbone Service was primarily used by academic and educational entities, and was a transitional network bridging the era of the ARPANET and CSNET into the modern Internet of today. With its success, the &quot;federally-funded backbone&quot; model gave way to a vision of commercially operated networks operating together to which the users purchased access.

On April 30, 1995, the NSFNET Backbone Service had been successfully transitioned to a new architecture and the NSFNET fiber optic backbone was decommissioned. At this point the NSFNET regional backbone networks were still central to the infrastructure of the expanding Internet, and there were still other NSFNET programs, but there was no longer a central NSFNET optical networking service.

After the transition, network traffic was carried on the NSFNET fiber optic regional backbone networks and any of several commercial backbone networks, internetMCI, PSINet, SprintLink, ANSNet, and others. Traffic between networks was exchanged at four Network Access Points or NAPs. Competitively established, and initially funded by NSF, the NAPs were located in New York (actually New Jersey), Washington, D.C., Chicago, and San Jose and run by Sprint, MFS Datanet, Ameritech, and Pacific Bell. The NAPs were the forerunners of modern Internet exchange points.

The NSFNET regional backbone networks could connect to any of their newer peer commercial backbone networks or directly to the NAPs, but in either case they would need to pay for their own connection infrastructure. NSF provided some funding for the NAPs and interim funding to help the regional networks make the transition, but did not fund the new commercial backbone networks directly.

To help ensure the stability of the Internet during and immediately after the transition from NSFNET, NSF conducted a solicitation to select a Routing Arbiter (RA) and ultimately made a joint award to the Merit Network and USC&#x27;s Information Science Institute to act as the RA.

To continue its promotion of advanced networking technology the NSF conducted a solicitation to create a very high-speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) which, like NSFNET before it, would focus on providing service to the research and education community. MCI won this award and created a 155Mbit/s (OC3c) and later a 622Mbit/s (OC12c) and 2.5Gbit/s (OC48c) ATM network to carry TCP/IP traffic primarily between the supercomputing centers and their users. NSF support was available to organizations that could demonstrate a need for very high speed networking capabilities and wished to connect to the vBNS or to the Abilene Network, the high speed network operated by the University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development (UCAID, aka Internet2).

At the February 1994 regional techs meeting in San Diego, the group revised its charter to include a broader base of network service providers, and subsequently adopted North American Network Operators&#x27; Group (NANOG) as its new name. Elise Gerich and Mark Knopper were the founders of NANOG and its first coordinators, followed by Bill Norton, Craig Labovitz, and Susan Harris.

==Controversy==
For much of the period from 1987 to 1995, following the opening up of the Internet through NSFNET and in particular after the creation of the for-profit ANS CO+RE in May 1991, some Internet stakeholders were concerned over the effects of privatization and the manner in which ANS, IBM, and MCI received a perceived competitive advantage in leveraging federal research money to gain ground in fields in which other companies allegedly were more competitive. &quot;The Cook Report on the Internet&quot;, which still exists, evolved as one of its largest critics. Other writers, such as Chetly Zarko, a University of Michigan alumnus and freelance investigative writer, offered their own critiques.

On March 12, 1992 the Subcommittee on Science of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, U.S. House of Representatives, held a hearing to review the management of NSFNET. Witnesses at the hearing were asked to focus on the agreement(s) that NSF put in place for the operation of the NSFNET backbone, the foundation&#x27;s plan for recompetition of those agreements, and to help the subcommittee explore whether the NSF&#x27;s policies provided a level playing field for network service providers, ensured that the network was responsive to user needs, and provided for effective network management. The subcommittee heard from seven witnesses, asked them a number of questions, and received written statements from all seven as well as from three others. At the end of the hearing, speaking to the two witnesses from NSF, Dr. Nico Habermann, Assistant NSF Director for the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate (CISE), and Dr. Stephen Wolff, Director of NSF&#x27;s Division of Networking &amp; Communications Research &amp; Infrastructure (DNCRI), Representative Boucher, Chairman of the subcommittee, said:

… I think you should be very proud of what you have accomplished. Even those who have some constructive criticism of the way that the network is presently managed acknowledge at the outset that you have done a terrific job in accomplishing the goal of this NSFNET, and its user-ship is enormously up, its cost to the users has come down, and you certainly have our congratulations for that excellent success.

Subsequently, the subcommittee drafted legislation, becoming law on October 23, 1992, which authorized the National Science Foundation

… to foster and support access by the research and education communities to computer networks which may be used substantially for purposes in addition to research and education in the sciences and engineering, if the additional uses will tend to increase the overall capabilities of the networks to support such research and education activities (that is to say, commercial traffic).

This legislation allowed, but did not require, NSF to repeal or modify its existing NSFNET Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) which restricted network use to activities in support of research and education.

The hearing also led to a request from Rep. Boucher asking the NSF Inspector General to conduct a review of NSF&#x27;s administration of NSFNET. The NSF Office of the Inspector General released its report on March 23, 1993. The report concluded by:
* stating that &quot;[i]n general we were favorably impressed with the NSFNET program and staff&quot;;
* finding no serious problems with the administration, management, and use of the NSFNET Backbone Service;
* complimenting the NSFNET partners, saying that &quot;the exchange of views among NSF, the NSFNET provider (Merit/ANS), and the users of NSFNET [via a bulletin board system], is truly remarkable in a program of the federal government&quot;; and
* making 17 &quot;recommendations to correct certain deficiencies and strengthen the upcoming re-solicitation.&quot;

<text>Ribhus (Sanskrit: ऋभु, ṛbhu, also Arbhu, Rbhus, Ribhuksan) is an ancient Indian word whose meaning evolved over time. In early layers of the Vedic literature, it referred to a sun deity. It evolved to being a wind deity, thereafter referred to three male artisans whose abilities and austerities make them into divinities in later Vedic texts. Their individual names were Ribhu (or Rhibhu), Vaja and Vibhvan (also called Vibhu), but they were collectively called Rhibhus or Ribhus (, pl. ṛbhava, also called Ribhuksan). Their name&#x27;s meaning is &quot;clever, skillful, inventive, prudent&quot;, cognate to Latin &quot;labor&quot; and Gothic &quot;arb-aiþs&quot; &quot;labour, toil&quot;, and perhaps to English &quot;elf&quot;.

Ribhus are depicted in some legends of the Vedic literature as three sons of the goddess of morning light named &quot;Saranyu&quot; and Hindu god Indra. In other legends, such as in the Atharvaveda, they are sons of &quot;Sudhanvan&quot;, which means good archer. In either legends, they are famous for their creative abilities, innovation and they design chariots, the magic cow of plenty, channels for rivers, and tools for Indra and other gods, which makes many envious. In later Hindu mythology, the Ribhus are born in human form who then bring their innovation to earth, remain humble and kind. This makes some gods angry and the Ribhus are refused entry back to heaven. Other gods intervene and make the inventive Ribhus immortal. They are revered in ancient Hindu texts as sages, as stars, or rays of the sun.

==Origin and meaning==
The Ribhus were first mentioned in the oldest Hindu scriptures of the Rigveda, wherein eleven hymns are dedicated to them (RV 1.20, 110, 111, 161, RV 3.60, RV 4.33-37, RV 7.48), and the Atharvaveda. They are said to be the sons of Sudhanvan, a descendant of Angiras. In later Hindu mythology (Vishnu Purana Book 2, Chapters 15 - 16 and the &quot;Song of Ribhu&quot;) Ribhu, supposed to be the leader of them, is said to be a son of Brahma. Unlike that identification the &quot;Puranic Encyclopedia&quot; states that this Ribhu is not identical with the leader of the Ribhus whose name therein is Rbhuksan. They are supposed to dwell in the solar sphere; Aitareya Brahmana III, 30 describes them as &quot;sun&#x27;s neighbours or pupils&quot;.

==Works==

The Ribhus are artists who formed the horses of Indra, the carriage of the Ashvins, and the miraculous cow of Brihaspati, made their parents young, and performed other wonderful works which according to RV 4.51.6 were &quot;done by the dawn&quot;. According to Yaska they also founded the sacrifices. They are supposed to take their ease and remain every year for twelve days idle in the house of Agohya (an appellation of Aditya which means &quot;one who cannot be concealed&quot;, therefore the Sun). When the Devas (gods) heard of their skill, they sent Agni to them, bidding them, to construct four cups from the one cup of Tvashtar, the artificer of the devas. When the Ribhus successfully had executed this task, the devas received them among themselves, gave them immortality and allowed them to partake of their sacrifices.

==Interpretations==

===Three Seasons===

According to Yaska and Sayana the Ribhus represent the rays of the sun. David Frawley states about that notion, that &quot;Vedic gods, like the Adityas, Maruts, Vasus and Rhibhus, often appear as rays of the sun, as stars or constellations&quot; Bal Gangadhar Tilak, stating that the interpretation of Yaska and Sayana could not explain their number, interpreted them 1893 referring to &quot;several European scholars&quot; as representing the three seasons of the year of the early Vedic period. The Satapata Brahmana XIV.I.1.28 mentions &quot;three divisions of the year&quot; and in RV 1.164.48 the &quot;three spokes&quot; are supposed to mean this three seasons. But Tilak didn&#x27;t show a relation of their name and works to this interpretation. So Arthur Berriedale Keith 1925 mentioned that &quot;the assertion that the Rbhus are really the Rthus&quot; (the seasons) &quot;is not &#x27;in the slightest degree plausible&#x27;&quot;.

===Twelve intercalary Days===

====Description====
According to Bal Gangadhar Tilak referring to RV 1.161.13 the twelve days, when the Ribhus rested at the house of Agohya, took place &quot;at the end of the year&quot;. He describes them as the holiest days of the year of which the ancestors of today&#x27;s Indians believed, that the devas then would leave heaven to visit the homes of the humans. As David Frawley mentioned in context of the seasons, according to RV 7.103.7 - 8 also as the long Atiratra rite of Soma was celebrated at this time.

Bal Gangadhar Tilak further interpreted the hound or dog, which according to RV 1.161.13 woke the Ribhus, as the &quot;dogstar&quot; Sirius, which appears at the vernal equinox &quot;at the end of the Pitriyana&quot;. The &quot;Pitriyana&quot; (meaning &quot;the path of the fathers&quot;, called Pitrs), are the six southern signs of the Zodiak, by Tilak also called &quot;the eternal waters of Yamaloka&quot;. Illustrative Maitrayani Upanishad VI, 1 describes the year as divided into two halfes, one of which belongs to Agni (Fire) and the other to Varuna (Water). Thus according to Bal Gangadhar Tilak in 1893 the year started at the time of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; at the vernal equinox and the Ribhus recommenced working after their awakening in the beginning of the new year. William Dwight Whitney 1895 rejected this interpretation by Tilak. In this context Tilak also pointed to the fact that because of RV 1.161.13 not the solar year but the anticlockwise movement of the precession of the equinoxes must be meant which he calls an &quot;equinoctial year&quot;, but he didn&#x27;t refer to this in his further interpretation.

====Interpretation====
Bal Gangadhar Tilak then interpreted also in 1893 the Period of twelve days as the twelve intercalary days, to fix the difference between the lunar year of 354 days and the solar year of 366 days. While he interpreted the beginning of the year at the vernal equinox, Arthur Anthony Macdonell 1917 stated that the twelve intercalary days &quot;in all probability&quot; were inserted at the winter solstice. A.B. Keith 1925 also criticized Tilak&#x27;s interpretation by pointing to &quot;... the fact that a year of 360 days and 12 months is ... the only year clearly known to the whole of Vedic literature prior to the late Sutras&quot;. Because he also &quot;admits that ancient Indians had knowledge of intercalation&quot; his statements on that point are considered &quot;confused&quot;. But already 1895 a similar view in terms of the length of the year was stated by George Thibaut and W.D. Whitney in &quot;Indian Antiquity&quot;. In 1960 Narendra Nath Law wrote in &quot;Indian Antiquity Quarterly&quot; that: &quot;W&lt;hitney&gt; would be correct if the 7th season or the 13th month (presumably for intercalation) had not been mentionend.&quot; He was referring to RV 1.164.15 which was interpreted by H.H. Wilson as describing seven seasons. But according to the translation of Ralph Thomas Hotchkin Griffith RV 1.164.15 means the seven Rishis, which according to David Frawley were actually eight seers, representing the Big Dipper. The eighth star of the big dipper is according to his later reference to RV 3.56.2 in connexion with RV 1.164.15 not the unseen fourth star of the handle forming a double star system but the Pole Star around which the big dipper rotates. Already Moritz Winternitz 1907 pointed &quot;to the fact that there are certain passages in the Vedic texts which admid of various interpretations.&quot; So A.B. Keith&#x27;s and A.A. Macdonell&#x27;s 1912 statement is still applicable, the 12 days were &quot;merely the &#x27;reflexion of the year&#x27; (samvatsarasya pratima) in the same way that they represent the twelve months and have no relation to chronology at all.&quot;

<text>Arjuna (, ) was an ancient prince of the Kuru Kingdom, located in the present-day India. He is one of the main protagonists of the Hindu epic &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;. He was the third of five Pandava brothers, from the lineage of the Kuru. In the Mahabharata War, Arjuna was a key warrior from the Pandava side in the battle of Kurukshetra. Before the beginning of the war, his mentor Krishna gave him the supreme knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita, guiding him through his moral dilemmas. Throughout the epic, Arjuna is the closest friend and companion of Krishna. 

Arjuna was the son of Kunti, the wife of Kuru King Pandu, and the god Indra, who fathered him due to Pandu&#x27;s curse. Renowned for his archery skills from an early age, he excelled in his training under the guidance of Drona. He emerged as the primary adversary of the Kauravas. He married Draupadi, who became the common wife of the Pandavas. 

Arjuna&#x27;s life was marked by two periods of exile. The first exile stemmed from a broken pact with his brothers, while the second followed the tragic loss of their kingdom through the game of dice. During his first exile, Arjuna married Ulupi, Chitrāngadā and Subhadra. From these unions, he fathered four sons: Shrutakarma, Iravan, Babhruvahana and Abhimanyu. His second exile saw him acquire many celestial weapons. Beyond his martial prowess, Arjuna was also a skilled musician and dancer. At the end of the epic the Pandavas, accompanied by Draupadi, retire to the Himalayas, where everyone in time passes away to arrive in heaven.

==Literary background==
The story of Arjuna is told in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, one of the Sanskrit epics from the Indian subcontinent. The work is written in Classical Sanskrit and is a composite work of revisions, editing and interpolations over many centuries. The oldest parts in the surviving version of the text may date to near 400 BCE.

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; manuscripts exist in numerous versions, wherein the specifics and details of major characters and episodes vary, often significantly. Except for the sections containing the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; which is remarkably consistent between the numerous manuscripts, the rest of the epic exists in many versions. The differences between the Northern and Southern recensions are particularly significant, with the Southern manuscripts more profuse and longer. Scholars have attempted to construct a critical edition, relying mostly on a study of the &quot;Bombay&quot; edition, the &quot;Poona&quot; edition, the &quot;Calcutta&quot; edition and the &quot;south Indian&quot; editions of the manuscripts. The most accepted version is one prepared by scholars led by Vishnu Sukthankar at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, preserved at Kyoto University, Cambridge University and various Indian universities.

==Life and legends==
===Birth and early life===
Arjuna was one of the five Pandava brothers of royal lineage, whose collective name derives from their father, and heir to the Lunar dynasty, Pandu. However, Pandu was under a curse whereby he would die if he had sexual relations with a woman, and so his sons were born using a mantra given to Kunti by sage Durvasa during her maiden days. His wivesMadri and Kuntiinvoked different gods and were also blessed with children. According to the legend, Arjuna was a demigod, who was born as a blessing after his mother Kunti invoked the god Indra on her husband&#x27;s request. The Mahabharata and Puranas such as &quot;Devi Bhagavata&quot; also records Arjuna as a reincarnation of a rishi called Nara.

Despite being the younger brother of Dhritarashtra, it was Pandu who succeeded their father as king of Bharata. This was because Dhritarashtra was blind, a disability that caused him to forfeit his right to the royal succession. Dhritarashtra fathered 100 sons, known as the Kaurava brothers, and ascended the throne on the death of Pandu. The Pandava brothers were then brought up with their cousins, the Kauravas, and the education of all these boys was supervised by Bheeshma. Among their teachers was the brahmin warrior called Drona, who considered Arjuna to be his favourite. According to Swami Parmeshwaranand, Arjuna was Drona&#x27;s most accomplished pupil. He notes an incident where Drona deemed that out of all his students, none but Arjuna had the steadfast focus to shoot the eye of a toy bird on a tree using a bow and arrow, and that Drona was proven right.

After the princes completed their training, Arjuna defeated Drupada of Panchala, who was impressed by the prince&#x27;s skills, as the &quot;gurudakshina&quot; for his beloved teacher Drona. Later, Duryodhana and his maternal uncle Shakuni planned to burn the Pandavas alive along with their mother Kunti. They built a palace out of lac in a village named Varanāvata. The Pandavas, though, managed to escape the house of lac with the help of Vidura through a secret tunnel.

===Marriages and children===

Arjuna married Draupadi, the fire born daughter of Drupada, who was the king of Panchala.

After the event of Lakshagriha, Arjuna, his mother and brothers decide to hide from Hastinapura. One day, Arjuna learns that Drupada is holding an archery tournament to determine who should marry his daughter. The tournament was to lift and string a bow, and fire arrows to pierce the eye of a golden fish only by looking at its reflection in the water. At the Swayamvara, almost all the assorted monarchs were unable to complete the challenge. In the end, Arjuna, dressed as a Brahmin, wins the tournament. Annoyed by their defeat, the kings attack Arjuna, but he defeats them and runs home to tell his mother of his success, shouting &quot;look what we have found&quot;. Commentators vary as to whether Kunti thought he was referring to alms found in the forest or to some great prize unknown to her. She tells him that the find must be shared with his brothers, as they had always shared such things in the past.

This misunderstanding, combined with the protocol that the oldest of the brothers, Yudhishthira, should marry first, leads to the agreement that all five brothers marry her. This is one of the rare examples of polyandry in Sanskrit literature. The brothers agreed that none should intrude if Draupadi was alone with one of the others, the penalty for doing so is a year to be spent in exile during which the culprit must remain celibate.

When Arjuna, his siblings, mother and Draupadi returned to Hastinapura, Dhritarashtra determined to avoid a rivalry developing for control of Hastinapur by splitting the kingdom, with half of it being left to his own eldest son, Duryodhana, and half to the eldest son of Pandu, Yudhishthira.

Arjuna inadvertently broke the pact with his brothers, intruding as he sought to collect weapons whilst Yudhishthira, was alone with Draupadi. He felt obliged to go into exile despite Yudhishthira&#x27;s attempts to dissuade him. It was this event that led to him forming a close relationship with his cousin Krishna because he ignored the celibacy condition of the pact and married three people on his travels, the first of whom was a Naga princess named Ulupi, with whom he had a son called Iravan. His second marriage was with a princess of Manipura, Chitrangada, who bore a son named Babhruvahana. The third was with Subhadra, the sister of Krishna. This last event, which took place in Dvaraka, is not the first meeting between Krishna and the Pandavas in the story but it does mark the start of a bond, sealed with the birth of the couple&#x27;s child, Abhimanyu, whom Krishna adores.

===Burning of Khandava Forest===

It was while at Indraprastha, the capital city of the Pandavas, for the birth of Abhimanyu that Arjuna and Krishna become involved in what Alf Hiltebeitel describes as &quot;one of the strangest scenes of the epic&quot;, this being the burning of the Khandava Forest. This story within a story has been interpreted in various ways.

The essence of this part of the myth is that Arjuna and Krishna are in the forest when they are approached by a hungry person. They agree to help satisfy his hunger, at which point he reveals himself to be Agni, the god of fire. Agni&#x27;s hunger can only be sated by consuming the entire forest and everything in it but his previous attempts to do this were thwarted by Indra, who is a protector of the forest and sent down rains to quench the fire. The cousins agree to fend off Indra and anyone else who might interfere; to this end, Arjuna armed himself with the Gandiva bow and Krishna with his Sudarshana Chakra, weapons suitable for a fight with the gods. They then begin to destroy the forest, battling against Indra and other gods, as well as demons, animals and snakes. Once the forest has gone, after six days of fire and slaughter, Arjuna and Krishna receive thanks from Indra, who had retreated with the other gods partway through the proceedings on being commanded by a mysterious voice to step back and watch.

===The game of dice===
As heir to the lordship of Kurukshetra, Yudhishthira had attracted the unwelcome attention of his Kaurava cousin, Duryodhana, who sought the throne. The royal consecration involved an elaborate Vedic ceremony called rajasuya which extended over several years and included the playing of a ritualised game of dice. This particular game, described as &quot;Indian literature&#x27;s most notorious dice game&quot; by Williams, was rigged by Duryodhana, causing Yudhishthira to gamble and lose everything, including his kingdom and his shared wife Draupadi. He and his brothers only obtained their freedom because Draupadi offered herself to the Kauravas in exchange. She was then humiliated by them so much that revenge for her treatment became a further motivation for the Pandavas in the rivalry with their cousins. During her humiliation, Karna called her an unchaste for marrying five men. This led Arjuna to take a vow of killing Karna. The brothers, including Arjuna, were forced into a 12-year exile, to be followed by a year living incognito if Yudhishthira was to regain his kingdom.

===Exile of the Pandavas===
While in this exile, Arjuna visited the Himalayas to get celestial weapons that he would be able to use against the Kauravas. Thereafter, he honed his battle skills with a visit to Swarga, the heaven of Indra, where he emerged victorious in a battle with the Daityas and also fought for Indra, his spiritual father, with the Gandiva.

After the battle at Khandava, Indra had promised Arjuna to give him all his weapons as a boon for matching him in battle with the requirement that Shiva is pleased with him. During the exile, following the advice of Krishna to go on meditation or &quot;tapasya&quot; to attain this divine weapon, Arjuna left his brothers for a penance on Indrakeeladri Hill (Koppal, Karnataka).

When Arjuna was in deep meditation, a wild boar ran towards him. He realized it and took out an arrow and shot it at the boar. But, another arrow had already pierced the boar. Arjuna was furious and he saw a hunter there. He confronted the hunter and they engaged in a fight. After hours of fighting, Arjuna was not able to defeat him and realized that the hunter was Shiva. Shiva was pleased and took his real form. He gave him Pashupatastra and told that the boar was Indra as he wanted to test Arjuna. After gaining the weapon, Indra took him to heaven and gave him many weapons.

During his exile, Arjuna was invited to the palace of Indra, his father. An apsara named Urvashi was impressed and attracted to Arjuna&#x27;s look and talent so she expresses her love in front of him. But Arjuna did not have any intentions of making love to Urvashi. Instead, he called her &quot;mother&quot;. Because once Urvashi was the wife of King Pururavas the ancestor of Kuru dynasty. Urvashi felt insulted and cursed Arjuna that he will be a eunuch for the rest of his life. Later on Indra&#x27;s request, Urvashi curtailed the curse to a period of one year.

=== At Matsya Kingdom ===

Arjuna spent the last year of exile as a eunuch named Brihannala at King Virata’s Matsya Kingdom. He taught singing and dancing to the princess Uttarā. After Kichaka humiliated and tried to molest Draupadi, Arjuna consoled her and Bhima killed Kichaka. When Duryodhana and his army attacked Matsya, Uttara, Uttarā&#x27;s brother, with Brihannala as his charioteer went to the army. Later that day, the year of Agyatavasa was over. Arjuna took Uttara away from the army to the forest where he had kept his divine bow, Gandiva, and revealed his identity to Uttara. He then fought Kaurava army and single-handedly defeated them including warriors like Bheeshma, Drona, Ashwatthama, Karna, Duryodhana etc. When Arjuna&#x27;s identity was revealed to the court, Uttarā was married to Arjuna&#x27;s son Abhimanyu.

===Kurukshetra War===

==== Bhagavat Gita ====
The &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; is a book within the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; that depicts a dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna immediately prior to the commencement of the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and Kauravas. According to Richard H. Davis, 

==== In the war ====
Arjuna was a key warrior in Pandava&#x27;s victory in the Kurukshetra. Arjuna&#x27;s prowess as an archer was demonstrated by his success in slaying numerous warriors, including his own elder brother Karna and grandfather Bhishma.

* Fall of Bheeshma: On the 10th day of battle, Shikhandi accompanied Arjuna on the latter&#x27;s chariot and they faced Bheeshma who did not fire arrows at Shikhandi. He was then felled in battle by Arjuna, pierced by innumerable arrows. With Sikhandi in front, Bheeshma did not even look in that direction, Arjuna shot arrows at Bheeshma, piercing his entire body.
* Death of Bhagadatta: On the 12th day of the war, Arjuna killed the powerful king of Pragjyotisha &quot;Bhagadatta&quot;, along with his mighty elephant Supratika.
* Death of Jayadratha: Arjuna learns that Jayadratha blocked the other four Pandavas, at the entrance of Chakravyuha, due to which Abhimanyu entered alone and was killed unfairly by multiple Kaurava warriors on the 13th day of the war. Arjuna vowed to kill him the very next day before sunset, failing which he would kill himself by jumping into a fire. Arjuna pierced into the Kaurava army on the 14th day, killing two aukshohinis (4.2 Lakh soldiers) of their army, and finally beheaded &quot;Jayadratha&quot; on the 14th day of the war.
* Death of Sudakshina: He killed Sudakshina the king of Kambojas on the 14th day using Indrastra killing him and a large part of his army. He also killed Shrutayu, Ashrutayu, Niyutayu, Dirghayu, Vinda, and Anuvinda during his quest to kill Jayadratha.
*Death of Susharma: Arjuna on the 18th day killed King Susharma of Trigarta Kingdom, the main Kaurava ally.
* Death of Karna: The much anticipated battle between Arjuna and Karna took place on the 17th day of war. The battle continued fiercely and Arjuna killed Karna by using Anjalikastra when Karna was weaponless.

===Later life and death===
After the Kurukshetra War, Yudhishthira appointed Arjuna as the Prime Minister of Hastinapur. Yudhishthira performed Ashvamedha. Arjuna followed the horse to the land of Manipura and encountered Babhruvahana, one of his sons. None of them knew one another. Babhruvahana asked Arjuna to fight and injured his father during the battle. Chitrāngadā came to the battlefield and revealed that Arjuna was her husband and Babhruvahana&#x27;s father. Ulupi, the second wife of Arjuna, revived Arjuna using a celestial gem called Nagamani.

After Krishna left his mortal body, Arjuna took the remaining citizens of Dwaraka to Indraprastha. On the way, they were attacked by a group of bandits. Arjuna desisted from fighting seeing the law of time.

Upon the onset of the &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;, and acting on the advice of Vyasa, Arjuna and other Pandavas retired, leaving the throne to Parikshit (Arjuna&#x27;s grandson and Abhimanyu&#x27;s son). Giving up all their belongings and ties, the Pandavas, accompanied by a dog, made their final journey of pilgrimage to the Himalayas. The listener of the Mahabharata is Janamejaya, Parikshit&#x27;s son and Arjuna&#x27;s great-grandson.

== Outside Indian subcontinent ==
===Indonesia===

In the Indonesian archipelago, the figure of Arjuna is also known and has been famous for a long time. Arjuna especially became popular in the areas of Java, Bali, Madura and Lombok. In Java and later in Bali, Arjuna became the main character in several kakawin, such as Kakawin Arjunawiwāha, Kakawin Pārthayajña, and Kakawin Pārthāyana (also known as Kakawin Subhadrawiwāha. In addition, Arjuna is also found in several temple reliefs on the island of Java, for example the Surawana temple.

==== Wayang story ====

Arjuna is a well-known figure in the world of wayang (Indonesian puppetry) in Javanese culture. Some of the characteristics of the wayang version of Arjuna may be different from that of Arjuna in the Indian version of the Mahābhārata book in Sanskrit. In the world of puppetry, Arjuna is described as a knight who likes to travel, meditate, and learn. Apart from being a student of Resi Drona at Padepokan Sukalima, he is also a student of Resi Padmanaba from the Untarayana Hermitage. Arjuna was a Brahman in Goa Mintaraga, with the title Bagawan Ciptaning. He was made the superior knight of the gods to destroy Prabu Niwatakawaca, the giant king of the Manimantaka country. For his services, Arjuna was crowned king in Dewa Indra&#x27;s heaven, with the title King Karitin and get the gift of magical heirlooms from the gods, including: Gendewa (from Bhatara Indra), Ardadadali Arrow (from Bhatara Kuwera), Cundamanik Arrow (from Bhatara Narada). After the Bharatayuddha war, Arjuna became king in Banakeling State, the former Jayadrata kingdom.
Arjuna has a smart and clever nature, is quiet, conscientious, polite, brave and likes to protect the weak. He leads the Madukara Duchy, within the territory of the state of Amarta. For the older generation of Java, he was the embodiment of a whole man. Very different from Yudhisthira, he really enjoyed life in the world. His love adventures always amaze the Javanese, but he is different from Don Juan who always chases women. It is said that Arjuna was so refined and handsome that princesses, as well as the ladies-in-waiting, would immediately offer themselves. They are the ones who get the honor, not Arjuna. He is very different from Wrekudara. He displayed a graceful body and a gentleness that was appreciated by the Javanese of all generations.

Arjuna also has other powerful heirlooms, among others: The Kiai Kalanadah Keris was given to Gatotkaca when he married Dewi Gowa (Arjuna&#x27;s son), Sangkali Arrow (from Resi Drona), Candranila Arrow, Sirsha Arrow, Sarotama Kiai Arrow, Pasupati Arrow (from Batara Guru), Panah Naracabala, Arrow Ardhadhedhali, Keris Kiai Baruna, Keris Pulanggeni (given to Abhimanyu), Terompet Dewanata, Cupu filled with Jayengkaton oil (given by Bagawan Wilawuk from Pringcendani hermitage) and Ciptawilaha Horse with Kiai Pamuk&#x27;s whip. Arjuna also has clothes that symbolize greatness, namely Kampuh or Limarsawo Cloth, Limarkatanggi Belt, Minangkara Gelung, Candrakanta Necklace and Mustika Ampal Ring (formerly belonging to King Ekalaya, the king of the Paranggelung state).

<text>Svarga (, ), also known as Swarga, Indraloka and Svargaloka, is the celestial abode of the devas in Hinduism. Svarga is one of the seven higher lokas (esoteric planes) in Hindu cosmology. Svarga is often translated as heaven, though it is regarded to be dissimilar to the concept of the Abrahamic Heaven.

== Description ==
Svarga is a set of celestial worlds located on and above Mount Meru, where those who had led righteous lives by adhering to the scriptures delight in pleasures, before their next birth on earth. It is described to have been built by the deity Tvashtar, the Vedic architect of the devas.

The king of the devas, Indra, is the ruler of Svarga, ruling it with his consort, Indrani. His palace in the abode is called Vaijayanta. This palace holds the famous hall, Sudharma, unrivalled among all the princely courts. The capital of Svarga is Amaravati, and its entrance is guarded by the legendary elephant, Airavata. Svarga is described to be the home of Kamadhenu, the cow of plenty, as well as Parijata, the tree that grants all wishes. The legendary Kalpavriksha tree grows in the centre of the Nandana gardens, which was planted there by Indra after it emerged from the Samudra Manthana, the churning of the ocean. Due to its location, Svarga is called Tridiva, the third highest heaven. 

In Hindu mythology, the devas&#x27; dominion over Svarga is often the primary point of contention in their eternal war with their rivals, the asuras. A common theme in these legends is an asura king, such as Hiranyakashipu, usurping the realm for himself. The preserver deity, Vishnu, often intervenes to restore the status quo. He sometimes assumes an avatar, such as Narasimha, to vanquish the asura king, restoring Indra and the devas to their place. During each pralaya (the great dissolution), the first three realms, Bhuloka, Bhuvarloka, and Svargaloka are destroyed. In contemporary Hinduism, Svarga itself is often relegated to the status of a lower heaven, one that is spiritually as well as physically beneath Vaikuntha and Kailasha, the celestial abodes of Vishnu and Shiva.

== Literature ==

=== &quot;Vedas&quot; ===
In the hymns of the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;, Svarga is conceptualised as Pitrloka, the land where one hopes to meet one&#x27;s departed ancestors. It is the abode that is rewarded for the one who performs sacrifices. The sacrifices that one performs are stated to journey directly to heaven, and are stored to await the sacrificer on his arrival. One hymn describes Svarga to be a realm that contains water-lilies and lotuses, lakes of butter with banks of honey, along with streams flowing with a number of foods such as wine, milk, curds, and water. Offering gifts to guests is also stated to be a path that secures heaven.

The &quot;Vedanta Shutra&quot; explains the concept of transmigration from Svarga to Bhuloka. It indicates that a &quot;jiva&quot; (life force) that has performed sacrifices and charitable acts ascends to Svarga, and when departing the abode and returning to earth, it descends as a raincloud, and is precipitated upon the earth as rain. When man consumes the food that is watered by the rain, it enters his semen, and during intercourse, enters a woman, to be reborn. It described &quot;sampata&quot; to be the term for the concept that allows one to ascend to heaven. It also states that the one who was of good conduct in Svarga attains the birth of a Brahmin, Kshatriya, or a Vaishya, and that others are condemned to lesser births, such as other animals or outcastes.

The &quot;Mundaka Upanishad&quot; affirms that the performance of Vedic rituals is necessary to attain Svarga.

=== &quot;Puranas&quot; ===
The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; states that Svarga is the realm for the one who is able to discriminate between right and wrong acts, and loves other people, engaging in good deeds for them. The good, the virtuous, and the devoted are described to be able to achieve the abode. It is stated to be a realm of gratification, where one is able to appreciate divine music, divine beauty, and divine objects, all of which are enough for any man. The duration of one&#x27;s stay in this loka is determined by the &quot;punya&quot; (virtue) one has accumulated. High intellect is not deemed to be sufficient to enter the abode if one lacks the necessary level of spirituality.

=== &quot;Ramayana&quot; ===
The acquisition of punya and the performance of good deeds is stated to be a prerequisite of attaining Svarga in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;.

The epic describes the legend of King Trishanku, who had been promised a place in Svarga by the sage Vishvamitra. The sage engaged in a solitary yajna to achieve this, not joined by other sages due to instructions from Sage Vasishta. Due to the power of the sage&#x27;s ceremony, the king ascended to the gates of Svarga. The devas reported this to Indra, who angrily kicked Trishanku from the abode because of his low birth, sending him hurtling towards the earth. Vishvamitra was able to halt his fall mid-way during his descent, and so the king was left suspended in the air. Indra opted to create a new Svarga below his own Svarga as a compromise, just for the residence of Trishanku. In retort, Vishvamitra created a new Indra and devas to occupy the new heaven with the king. Terrified of the powers of the sage, Indra relented, and personally carried Trishanku to the real Svarga on his own golden &quot;vimana&quot;.

=== &quot;Mahabharata&quot; ===
In the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the prince Arjuna is escorted to Svarga by Matali, the charioteer of Indra, the prince&#x27;s father. During the journey, he witnesses thousands of flying celestial cars, &quot;vimana&quot;s. He observes that there is neither sun nor moon that is necessary to offer light in this realm, as it is entirely self-luminous. He takes note of the residents of Svarga: rishis, heroes who had died in battle, those who had performed severe austerities, gandharvas, guhyakas, as well as apsaras. He passes through the several successive regions of heaven until he arrives at Amaravati, the capital of Indra.

In Amaravati, Arjuna beholds the gardens of Nandana, the favourite resort of the apsaras. He observes that sacred trees and flowers of all seasons bloom. He is eulogised by various classes of beings, such as deities like the Ashvins and the Maruts, the royal sages, headed by Dilipa, and exalted Brahmanas. He is treated to the most sacred and profane music of the finest gandharva, Tumvuru, and observes the dances of the most enticing apsaras, such as Menaka, Rambha, and Urvashi.

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; suggests the existence of several forms or regions of Svarga, each headed by a deity, such as Surya, Kubera, and Varuna. Indra is stated to sate all the desires of the residents. Men and women enjoy each other&#x27;s pleasures without restriction, and there is no form of jealousy between the sexes. 

In the text, Nahusha opines to Yudhisthira that offering charity, speaking pleasing words, honesty, and &quot;ahimsa&quot; allows one to achieve heaven.

=== &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; ===

In the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, it is indicated that Svarga is not the everlasting destination of those who had accumulated &quot;punya.&quot;

<text>Mount Meru (Sanskrit/Pali: मेरु)—also known as Sumeru, Sineru or Mahāmeru—is a sacred, five-peaked mountain present within Hindu, Jain and Buddhist cosmologies, revered as the centre of all physical, metaphysical and spiritual universes. It is professed to be located at the junction of the four great cosmic continents—Pubbavideha Dīpa, Uttarakuru Dīpa, Amaragoyāna Dīpa and Jambu Dīpa. Despite not having a clearly identified or known geophysical location, Mount Meru is, nevertheless, always thought of as being either in the Himalayan Mountains or the Aravalli Range (in western India). Mount Meru is also mentioned in scriptures of other, external religions to India, such as Taoism—which was influenced, itself, by the arrival of Buddhism in China. 

Many Hindu, Jain and Buddhist temples have been built as symbolic representations of Mount Meru. The &quot;Sumeru Throne&quot; (:zh:须弥座; &quot;xūmízuò&quot;) style is a common feature of Chinese pagodas. The highest point (the finial bud) on the &quot;pyatthat&quot;, a Burmese-style multi-tiered roof, represents Mount Meru.

== Etymology ==
Etymologically, &#x27;meru&#x27; in Sanskrit means &quot;high.&quot; The proper name of the mountain is &quot;Meru&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;Meruparvata&quot;), to which is added the approbatory prefix &quot;su-&quot;, resulting in the meaning &quot;excellent Mount Meru&quot; or &quot;sublime Mount Meru&quot;. &quot;Meru&quot; is also the name of the central bead in a mālā.

== In other languages ==
In other languages, Mount Meru is pronounced:
* Assamese: (Meru Pôrbôt)
* Bengali: (Meru Porbot)
* Burmese: ()
* Cebuano: 
* Chinese: (&quot;Xūmíshān&quot;)
* Gujarati: (&quot;Meru Parvat&quot;)
* Sanskrit, Marathi, Hindi: (&quot;Meru Parvat&quot;)
* Ilocano: 
* Japanese: (&quot;Shumisen&quot;)
* Javanese: (Semeru)
* Kannada: (&quot;Meru Parvata&quot;)
* Khmer: (&quot;Phnom Preah Someru&quot;) or (&quot;Phnom Preah Somae&quot;)
* Korean: (&quot;Sumisan&quot;)
* Malayalam: (&quot;Mahameru Parvatham&quot;)
* Mongolian: (&quot;Sümber Uul&quot;)
* Nepali: सुमेरु पर्वत (&quot;Sumeru Parwat&quot;)
* Odia: (“Meru Pôrbôtô”)
* Old Maldivian: &quot;Sumēru-Mandara&quot; (sometimes spelt as Ṣumeru-Mandara)
* Pāli: 
* Punjabi: (&quot;Meru Parbat&quot;)
* Tagalog: 
* Tamil: (&quot;Maha Meru Malai&quot;)
* Telugu: (&quot;Meru Parvatham&quot;)
* Sinhala: (&quot;Maha Meru Parvathaya&quot;)
* Tibetan: (Wylie: &quot;ri gyal po ri rab)&quot;
* Thai: (&quot;Khao phra sumen&quot;)
* Vietnamese: 

The mountain is also mentioned by Diodorus Siculus as Mēros () and ascribes to Dionysus events related in Indian mythology, trying to use this as explanation as to why the Greeks had come to say Dionysus was born out of a thigh (whose word in Ancient Greek is indeed ).

==Geography==
The dimensions attributed to Mount Meru — which all refer to it as a part of the Cosmic Ocean, along with several other statements that describe it in geographically vague terms (for example, &quot;the Sun along with all the planets circle the mountain&quot;) — make the determination of its location most difficult, according to most scholars.

Several researchers identify Mount Meru or Sumeru with the Pamirs, northwest of Kashmir.

The Suryasiddhanta mentions that Mt. Meru lies at the centre of &quot;the Earth&quot; (&quot;bhuva-madhya&quot;) in the land of the Jambunad (Jambudvīpa). &quot;Narapatijayacharyasvarodaya&quot;, a ninth-century text, based on mostly unpublished texts of Yāmal Tantr, mentions:
: &quot; Prithvī-madhye shrūyate drishyate na tu&quot;
: (Sumeru is heard to be at the centre of the Earth, but is not seen there).
Several versions of cosmology can be found in existing Hindu texts. In all of them, cosmologically, the Meru mountain was also described as being surrounded by Mandrachala Mountain to the east, Suparshva Mountain to the west, Kumuda Mountain to the north, and Kailasha to the south.

== In Buddhism ==

According to Buddhist cosmology, Mount Meru (or Sumeru) is at the centre of the world, and Jambūdvīpa is south of it. It is 80,000 yojanas wide and 80,000 yojanas high according to the &quot;Abhidharmakośabhāṣyam&quot; and 84,000 yojanas high according to the &quot;Long Āgama Sutra&quot;. Trāyastriṃśa is at its peak, where Śakra resides. The Sun and the Moon revolve around Mount Meru, and as the Sun passes behind it, it becomes nighttime. The mountain has four faces — each one made of a different material; the northern face is made of gold, the eastern one is made of crystal, the southern one is made of lapis lazuli, and the western one is made of ruby.

In Vajrayāna, maṇḍala offerings often include Mount Meru, as they in part represent the entire universe. It is also believed that Mount Meru is the home of the Buddha Cakrasaṃvara.

== In Hinduism ==
Hindus believe Mount Meru to be a stairway to &quot;Svarga&quot;, a heaven where the devas reside. Meru is considered as the center of the universe and is described as 84,000 yojanas high, about , which would be 85 times the Earth&#x27;s diameter. One yojana can be taken to mean about 11.5 km (9 miles), though its magnitude seems to differ over periods — for example, the Earth&#x27;s circumference is 3,200 yojanas according to Varahamihira and slightly less so in the &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot;, but is said to be 5,026.5 yojanas in the Suryasiddhānta. The &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; and the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, along with some other Hindu texts, consistently give the height of 84,000 yojanas to Mount Meru, which translates into 672,000 miles or 1,082,000 kilometers. The Sun and Moon along with all the planets revolve around Mount Meru which connects the earth with the under world and heaven with Shiva residing on top of the mountain at Kailasha. Gods and devas are described as frequenting Mount Meru.

According to the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Meru is located amidst the &quot;Himavat&quot; range between Malayavat and Gandhamadhana mountains. Some scriptures indicate that Shiva resides in a horn of the mountains called as &quot;Saivatra&quot;. &quot;Mahabharata&quot; further states that the mountain gleans of gold when the rays of the sun fall on it and is said to contain lovely woods, lakes, rivers adorned with fruit trees, precious stones and life saving herbs. It also describes Meru as the means to reach heaven and only a being without any sins would be able to scale it. Meru is also said to be the residence of Kubera who lives near a golden gate with a lake called &quot;Alaka&quot; adorned with golden lotuses and sweet tasting water from which Mandakini river arises. As per the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the Pandavas along with their wife Draupadi, traveled towards the summit of the mountain as a means to reach the heaven but only Yudhishthira who was accompanied by a dog, was able to make it.

The Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot; describes Kailash and Lake Manasarovar located in the Mount Meru as places unlike anywhere in the world.

&quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; states that Meru is a pillar of the world, located at the heart of six mountain ranges symbolizing a lotus. It also states that the four faces of Mount Kailash are made of crystal, ruby, gold, and lapis lazuli. It further talks about Shiva sitting in a lotus position, engaged in deep meditation within the confines of the mountain. The mountain is home to four lakes, whose water is shared by the gods and four rivers that originate from the Ganges and flow to the earth. The &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; describes similarly with the mountain located close to a lake consisting of clear water with lotuses and lilies decked with water birds. &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; places Kailash as located south of Mount Meru. &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; mentions that the mountain is located amongst the highest peaks, perpetually covered with snow. Mount Meru was said to be the residence of King Padmaja Brahma in antiquity.

This mythical mountain of gods was mentioned in the Tantu Pagelaran, an Old Javanese manuscript written in the 15th-century Majapahit period. The manuscript describes the mythical origin of the island of Java, as well as the legendary movement of portions of Mount Meru to Java. The manuscript explains that Batara Guru (Shiva) ordered the gods Brahma and Vishnu to fill Java with human beings. However, at that time, Java island was floating freely on the ocean, always tumbling and shaking. To stop the island&#x27;s movement, the gods decided to nail it to the Earth by moving the part of Mahameru in Jambudvipa (India) and attaching it to Java. The resulting mountain is Mount Semeru, the tallest mountain in Java.

== In Jainism ==
According to Jain cosmology, Mount Meru (or &quot;Sumeru&quot;) is at the centre of the world surrounded by Jambūdvīpa, in the form of a circle forming a diameter of 100,000 yojanas. There are two sets of sun, moon, and stars revolving around Mount Meru; while one set works, the other set rests behind Mount Meru.

Every Tirthankara is taken to the summit of Meru by Indra shortly after his birth, after putting the Tirthankara child&#x27;s mother into a deep slumber. There, he is bathed and anointed with precious unctions. Indra and other Devas celebrate his birth.

== Architecture ==
The concept of a holy mountain surrounded by various circles was incorporated into ancient Hindu temple architecture with a &quot;Shikhara&quot; (&quot;Śikhara&quot;) — a Sanskrit word translating literally to &quot;peak&quot; or &quot;summit&quot;. Early examples of this style can be found at the Harshat Mata Temple and Harshnath Temple from the 8th century CE in Rajasthan, Western India. This concept also continued outside India, such as in Bali, where temples feature Meru towers.

In Buddhist temples, the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya is the earliest example of the 5th- to 6th-century depiction. Many other Buddhist temples took on this form, such as the Wat Arun in Thailand and the Hsinbyume Pagoda in Myanmar.

<doc id="100265" wikidata="Q913413" url="?curid=100265" title="Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin">
<text>Wisconsin Dells is a city in Adams, Columbia, Juneau, and Sauk counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. A popular Midwestern tourist destination, Wisconsin Dells is home to several water parks and tourist attractions. The city had a population of 2,942 as of the 2020 census.

The city takes its name from the Dells of the Wisconsin River, a scenic, glacial-formed gorge that features sandstone formations along the banks of the Wisconsin River. Wisconsin Dells is about northwest of Madison, the state&#x27;s capital city. It is located in the greater Madison metropolitan area.

==History==
The natural formation of the Dells was named by Early French explorers as , a rapids or narrows on a river in French. Wisconsin Dells is located on ancestral Ho-Chunk and Menominee land. The Ho-Chunk name for Wisconsin Dells is , meaning &quot;rocks close together&quot;.

According to Indian agent Joseph Montfort Street, the Sauk leader Black Hawk sought refuge with Ho-Chunks near the Dells of the Wisconsin River at the end of the Black Hawk War of 1832 before surrendering to the United States, but more recent research has argued that this was a mistranslation of the true location. The U.S. acquired the land in treaties with the Ho-Chunk nation in 1837 and with the Menominee in 1848, but Ho-Chunk people who resisted the U.S. policy of Indian removal continued to return to the area and eventually acquired small homesteads.

The city of Wisconsin Dells was founded in 1856 by the Wisconsin Hydraulic Company, a dam-building and real estate investment business. The town was originally named Kilbourn City for Byron Kilbourn, the president of the La Crosse &amp; Milwaukee Railroad Company, which was then preparing to build a railroad across the Wisconsin River to connect Milwaukee and La Crosse, Wisconsin. The railroad&#x27;s route caused great local controversy. Boosters and speculators had anticipated the river crossing two miles downriver, where they had established the town of Newport, Wisconsin, and attracted around 1,500 residents by 1855. When the railroad instead completed a slightly more northern route in 1857, Newport rapidly turned into a ghost town as its residents relocated to the site of the railroad bridge, bringing many buildings and even a church from the earlier town to reassemble in Kilbourn City.

In 1859, lumbermen destroyed the Wisconsin Hydraulic Company&#x27;s new dam at Kilbourn City because it blocked the flow of timber rafts down the river. This led the company&#x27;s main creditor, Byron Kilbourn, to foreclose on its property and take ownership of most of the city&#x27;s real estate.

===Tourism===

Kilbourn City quickly became a popular travel destination in the Midwest due to the scenery of the Dells of the Wisconsin River and the ready railroad access. In 1856, entrepreneur Leroy Gates began taking tourists on boat tours of the Wisconsin Dells and promoting the town to railroad travelers. These tours were given using wooden rowboats until 1873 when two excursion steamers, the &quot;Modocawanda&quot; and the &quot;Dell Queen&quot; launched. Gates also established a photography studio in the city, which he sold to photographer H. H. Bennett in 1865. Over the following decades, Bennett took many photos of the sandstone formations in the dells, including stereoscopic views, as well as portraits of local Ho-Chunk people in Indian costume. Prints of Bennett&#x27;s photographs were distributed across the United States and played a large role in promoting Kilbourn City as an exotic destination for sightseers. The H. H. Bennett Studio is now a historic site operated by the Wisconsin Historical Society.

In 1909, the Kilbourn Dam was completed across the Wisconsin River to generate hydroelectricity, over the protests of people such as H. H. Bennett, separating the Dells into the Upper and Lower Dells. It is now owned by Alliant Energy.

In 1928 Mr. Clinton Berry established Berry&#x27;s Dells airport. It occupied sixty acres and was designated on government maps as beacon No. 19. Berry built the airport to carry visitors to the Dells from the surrounding metropolitan areas.

Kilbourn City shortened its name to &quot;Kilbourn&quot; in 1895 and then changed its name to &quot;Wisconsin Dells&quot; in 1931, identifying itself with the famous natural landscape of the Dells of the Wisconsin River.

In 1952, a new traveling performance from Chicago called &quot;Tommy Bartlett&#x27;s Thrill Show&quot; came to Lake Delton on its second stop. Following the show&#x27;s huge success in the city, its owner, Tommy Bartlett, chose to keep the performance permanently in Wisconsin Dells. To promote the show, Bartlett gave away bumper stickers advertising his thrill show and the city, effectively spreading word about the area across the nation. That tourist attraction closed permanently in 2020.

Soon more attractions followed to serve the ever-increasing tourists, along with many hotels, shops, and restaurants. Today, a large number of water parks are central to the local economy.

Lake Delton, Wisconsin Dells&#x27;s sister city to the south, gradually became popular as the Dells attractions spread out. The Wonder Spot was founded in Lake Delton in 1952 and remained open until 2006.

==Economy==
Tourism is the major contributor to the economy of Wisconsin Dells. The Dells area has many indoor and outdoor waterparks, proclaiming itself the &quot;Waterpark Capital of the World&quot;. Other attractions include boat tours, zip-lining, golf courses, mini golf, go-kart tracks, water sports, horseback riding, a water ski show known as the Tommy Bartlett&#x27;s Thrill Show (now closed), museums, amusement parks, Wizard Quest, and a casino. Most attractions are located on the Strip, otherwise known as the Wisconsin Dells Parkway. Accommodations range from economical motels to RV parks to chain hotels to themed resorts featuring indoor and outdoor waterparks and other amenities.

Amphibious DUKW vehicles called &quot;ducks&quot; began offering duck tours to tourists in Wisconsin Dells in 1946. The tours visit wilderness trails and enter nearby Lake Delton and the Wisconsin River. One company, Original Wisconsin Ducks, has more than 90 vehicles and is the largest operator of duck tours in the United States. Mayor Brian Landers stated, &quot;Many of our own residents take duck rides. I&#x27;ve taken duck rides myself&quot;.

Since the late 1970s, the Dells area (Wisconsin Dells and Lake Delton) has become a water park mecca. Noah&#x27;s Ark Waterpark opened in Lake Delton in 1979 and has become the largest and the eighth most visited water park in the U.S. Other outdoor amusement and water parks followed, featuring water slides, mini golf, roller coasters, go-karts, and other attractions.

The Polynesian Resort Hotel opened the United States&#x27; and the Dells area&#x27;s first indoor waterpark in 1994. Since then, the number of combination resort/indoor waterparks in the Wisconsin Dells area has swelled, with each new indoor waterpark trying to have the latest innovations in waterslides and to be able to claim the title of America&#x27;s largest park.

The Big 5 Dells resorts with large indoor waterparks are the Mt. Olympus Water &amp; Theme Park, Wilderness Territory, Kalahari Resort, Chula Vista Resort, and Great Wolf Lodge. Other smaller hotels with waterparks include the Atlantis Resort.

In 2005, Big Chief Karts and Coasters merged with the former Family Land Waterpark and Treasure Island Hotel to create a large theme park on the border of Lake Delton and Wisconsin Dells, with a resort called Hotel Rome, an indoor waterpark, outdoor waterpark, theme park, and the area&#x27;s first indoor theme park. The park, which has roller coasters, go-karts, and water slides, is called Mt. Olympus Water &amp; Theme Park.

The Tanger Outlet Center opened in 2006 near the Great Wolf Lodge, replacing the defunct Wisconsin Dells Greyhound Park, which opened in May 1990, but closed in 1996 due to heavy competition from the nearby Ho-Chunk Gaming Wisconsin Dells Bingo/Casino. Since Mt. Olympus opened the Parthenon Indoor Theme Park in 2006, two more indoor theme parks were constructed in the area: Knuckleheads outside the Tanger Complex in 2007, and Kalahari Resort in December 2008. New attractions being constructed include more indoor waterpark resorts, the Grand Cambrian Resort, and the Wedge Resort.

<text>In mathematics, a dihedral group is the group of symmetries of a regular polygon, which includes rotations and reflections. Dihedral groups are among the simplest examples of finite groups, and they play an important role in group theory, geometry, and chemistry.

The notation for the dihedral group differs in geometry and abstract algebra. In geometry, or refers to the symmetries of the -gon, a group of order . In abstract algebra, refers to this same dihedral group. This article uses the geometric convention, .

==Definition==
The word &quot;dihedral&quot; comes from &quot;di-&quot; and &quot;-hedron&quot;.
The latter comes from the Greek word hédra, which means &quot;face of a geometrical solid&quot;. Overall it thus refers to the two faces of a polygon.

===Elements===

A regular polygon with formula_1 sides has formula_2 different symmetries: formula_1 rotational symmetries and formula_1 reflection symmetries. Usually, we take formula_5 here. The associated rotations and reflections make up the dihedral group formula_6. If formula_1 is odd, each axis of symmetry connects the midpoint of one side to the opposite vertex. If formula_1 is even, there are formula_9 axes of symmetry connecting the midpoints of opposite sides and formula_9 axes of symmetry connecting opposite vertices. In either case, there are formula_1 axes of symmetry and formula_2 elements in the symmetry group. Reflecting in one axis of symmetry followed by reflecting in another axis of symmetry produces a rotation through twice the angle between the axes.

===Group structure===
As with any geometric object, the composition of two symmetries of a regular polygon is again a symmetry of this object. With composition of symmetries to produce another as the binary operation, this gives the symmetries of a polygon the algebraic structure of a finite group.

The following Cayley table shows the effect of composition in the group D3 (the symmetries of an equilateral triangle). r0 denotes the identity; r1 and r2 denote counterclockwise rotations by 120° and 240° respectively, and s0, s1 and s2 denote reflections across the three lines shown in the adjacent picture.

For example, , because the reflection s1 followed by the reflection s2 results in a rotation of 120°. The order of elements denoting the composition is right to left, reflecting the convention that the element acts on the expression to its right. The composition operation is not commutative.

In general, the group D&quot;n&quot; has elements r0, ..., r&quot;n&quot;−1 and s0, ..., s&quot;n&quot;−1, with composition given by the following formulae:

:formula_13

In all cases, addition and subtraction of subscripts are to be performed using modular arithmetic with modulus &quot;n&quot;.

===Matrix representation===

If we center the regular polygon at the origin, then elements of the dihedral group act as linear transformations of the plane. This lets us represent elements of D&quot;n&quot; as matrices, with composition being matrix multiplication.
This is an example of a (2-dimensional) group representation.

For example, the elements of the group D4 can be represented by the following eight matrices:

:formula_14

In general, the matrices for elements of D&quot;n&quot; have the following form:

:formula_15

r&quot;k&quot; is a rotation matrix, expressing a counterclockwise rotation through an angle of . s&quot;k&quot; is a reflection across a line that makes an angle of with the &quot;x&quot;-axis.

===Other definitions===
 is the semidirect product of formula_16 acting on formula_17 via the automorphism formula_18.

It hence has presentation
: formula_19

Using the relation formula_20, we obtain the relation formula_21. 
It follows that formula_22 is generated by formula_23 and formula_24. This substitution also shows that formula_22 has the presentation
:formula_26
In particular, belongs to the class of Coxeter groups.

==Small dihedral groups==

 is isomorphic to , the cyclic group of order 2.

 and are exceptional in that:
* and are the only abelian dihedral groups. Otherwise, is non-abelian.
* is a subgroup of the symmetric group for . Since for or , for these values, is too large to be a subgroup.
* The inner automorphism group of is trivial, whereas for other even values of , this is .

The cycle graphs of dihedral groups consist of an &quot;n&quot;-element cycle and &quot;n&quot; 2-element cycles. The dark vertex in the cycle graphs below of various dihedral groups represents the identity element, and the other vertices are the other elements of the group. A cycle consists of successive powers of either of the elements connected to the identity element.


==The dihedral group as symmetry group in 2D and rotation group in 3D==

An example of abstract group , and a common way to visualize it, is the group of Euclidean plane isometries which keep the origin fixed. These groups form one of the two series of discrete point groups in two dimensions. consists of rotations of multiples of about the origin, and reflections across lines through the origin, making angles of multiples of with each other. This is the symmetry group of a regular polygon with sides (for ; this extends to the cases and where we have a plane with respectively a point offset from the &quot;center&quot; of the &quot;1-gon&quot; and a &quot;2-gon&quot; or line segment).

 is generated by a rotation of order and a reflection of order 2 such that

:formula_27

In geometric terms: in the mirror a rotation looks like an inverse rotation.

In terms of complex numbers: multiplication by formula_28 and complex conjugation.

In matrix form, by setting

:formula_29

and defining formula_30 and formula_31 for formula_32 we can write the product rules for D&quot;n&quot; as

:formula_33

(Compare coordinate rotations and reflections.)

The dihedral group D2 is generated by the rotation r of 180 degrees, and the reflection s across the &quot;x&quot;-axis. The elements of D2 can then be represented as {e, r, s, rs}, where e is the identity or null transformation and rs is the reflection across the &quot;y&quot;-axis.

D2 is isomorphic to the Klein four-group.

For &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2 the operations of rotation and reflection in general do not commute and D&quot;n&quot; is not abelian; for example, in D4, a rotation of 90 degrees followed by a reflection yields a different result from a reflection followed by a rotation of 90 degrees.

Thus, beyond their obvious application to problems of symmetry in the plane, these groups are among the simplest examples of non-abelian groups, and as such arise frequently as easy counterexamples to theorems which are restricted to abelian groups.

The elements of can be written as , , , ... , , , , , ... , . The first listed elements are rotations and the remaining elements are axis-reflections (all of which have order 2). The product of two rotations or two reflections is a rotation; the product of a rotation and a reflection is a reflection.

So far, we have considered to be a subgroup of , i.e. the group of rotations (about the origin) and reflections (across axes through the origin) of the plane. However, notation is also used for a subgroup of SO(3) which is also of abstract group type : the proper symmetry group of a &quot;regular polygon embedded in three-dimensional space&quot; (if &quot;n&quot; ≥ 3). Such a figure may be considered as a degenerate regular solid with its face counted twice. Therefore, it is also called a &quot;dihedron&quot; (Greek: solid with two faces), which explains the name &quot;dihedral group&quot; (in analogy to &quot;tetrahedral&quot;, &quot;octahedral&quot; and &quot;icosahedral group&quot;, referring to the proper symmetry groups of a regular tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron respectively).

===Examples of 2D dihedral symmetry===
==Properties==

The properties of the dihedral groups with depend on whether is even or odd. For example, the center of consists only of the identity if &quot;n&quot; is odd, but if &quot;n&quot; is even the center has two elements, namely the identity and the element r&quot;n&quot;/2 (with D&quot;n&quot; as a subgroup of O(2), this is inversion; since it is scalar multiplication by −1, it is clear that it commutes with any linear transformation).

In the case of 2D isometries, this corresponds to adding inversion, giving rotations and mirrors in between the existing ones.

For &quot;n&quot; twice an odd number, the abstract group is isomorphic with the direct product of and .
Generally, if &quot;m&quot; divides &quot;n&quot;, then has &quot;n&quot;/&quot;m&quot; subgroups of type , and one subgroup formula_34&quot;m&quot;. Therefore, the total number of subgroups of (&quot;n&quot; ≥ 1), is equal to &quot;d&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) + σ(&quot;n&quot;), where &quot;d&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the number of positive divisors of &quot;n&quot; and &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the sum of the positive divisors of &quot;n&quot;. See list of small groups for the cases &quot;n&quot; ≤ 8.

The dihedral group of order 8 (D4) is the smallest example of a group that is not a T-group. Any of its two Klein four-group subgroups (which are normal in D4) has as normal subgroup order-2 subgroups generated by a reflection (flip) in D4, but these subgroups are not normal in D4.

===Conjugacy classes of reflections===
All the reflections are conjugate to each other whenever &quot;n&quot; is odd, but they fall into two conjugacy classes if &quot;n&quot; is even. If we think of the isometries of a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon: for odd &quot;n&quot; there are rotations in the group between every pair of mirrors, while for even &quot;n&quot; only half of the mirrors can be reached from one by these rotations. Geometrically, in an odd polygon every axis of symmetry passes through a vertex and a side, while in an even polygon there are two sets of axes, each corresponding to a conjugacy class: those that pass through two vertices and those that pass through two sides.

Algebraically, this is an instance of the conjugate Sylow theorem (for &quot;n&quot; odd): for &quot;n&quot; odd, each reflection, together with the identity, form a subgroup of order 2, which is a Sylow 2-subgroup ( is the maximum power of 2 dividing ), while for &quot;n&quot; even, these order 2 subgroups are not Sylow subgroups because 4 (a higher power of 2) divides the order of the group.

For &quot;n&quot; even there is instead an outer automorphism interchanging the two types of reflections (properly, a class of outer automorphisms, which are all conjugate by an inner automorphism).

==Automorphism group==
The automorphism group of is isomorphic to the holomorph of formula_34/&quot;n&quot;formula_34, i.e., to and has order &quot;nϕ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), where &quot;ϕ&quot; is Euler&#x27;s totient function, the number of &quot;k&quot; in coprime to &quot;n&quot;.

It can be understood in terms of the generators of a reflection and an elementary rotation (rotation by &quot;k&quot;(2&quot;π&quot;/&quot;n&quot;), for &quot;k&quot; coprime to &quot;n&quot;); which automorphisms are inner and outer depends on the parity of &quot;n&quot;.
* For &quot;n&quot; odd, the dihedral group is centerless, so any element defines a non-trivial inner automorphism; for &quot;n&quot; even, the rotation by 180° (reflection through the origin) is the non-trivial element of the center.
* Thus for &quot;n&quot; odd, the inner automorphism group has order 2&quot;n&quot;, and for &quot;n&quot; even (other than ) the inner automorphism group has order &quot;n&quot;.
* For &quot;n&quot; odd, all reflections are conjugate; for &quot;n&quot; even, they fall into two classes (those through two vertices and those through two faces), related by an outer automorphism, which can be represented by rotation by &quot;π&quot;/&quot;n&quot; (half the minimal rotation).
* The rotations are a normal subgroup; conjugation by a reflection changes the sign (direction) of the rotation, but otherwise leaves them unchanged. Thus automorphisms that multiply angles by &quot;k&quot; (coprime to &quot;n&quot;) are outer unless .

===Examples of automorphism groups===
 has 18 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D9, the group has mirrors at 20° intervals. The 18 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 20°, and reflections. As isometry group these are all automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these, 36 outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying angles of rotation by 2.

 has 10 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D10, the group has mirrors at 18° intervals. The 10 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 36°, and reflections. As isometry group there are 10 more automorphisms; they are conjugates by isometries outside the group, rotating the mirrors 18° with respect to the inner automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these 10 inner and 10 outer automorphisms, 20 more outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying rotations by 3.

Compare the values 6 and 4 for Euler&#x27;s totient function, the multiplicative group of integers modulo &quot;n&quot; for &quot;n&quot; = 9 and 10, respectively. This triples and doubles the number of automorphisms compared with the two automorphisms as isometries (keeping the order of the rotations the same or reversing the order).

The only values of &quot;n&quot; for which &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 2 are 3, 4, and 6, and consequently, there are only three dihedral groups that are isomorphic to their own automorphism groups, namely (order 6), (order 8), and (order 12).

===Inner automorphism group===
The inner automorphism group of is isomorphic to:
* if &quot;n&quot; is odd;
* if is even (for , ).

==Generalizations==
There are several important generalizations of the dihedral groups:
* The infinite dihedral group is an infinite group with algebraic structure similar to the finite dihedral groups. It can be viewed as the group of symmetries of the integers.
* The orthogonal group O(2), &quot;i.e.,&quot; the symmetry group of the circle, also has similar properties to the dihedral groups.
* The family of generalized dihedral groups includes both of the examples above, as well as many other groups.
* The quasidihedral groups are family of finite groups with similar properties to the dihedral groups.

<text>Paul Samuel Whiteman (March 28, 1890 – December 29, 1967) was an American Jazz bandleader, composer, orchestral director, and violinist.

As the leader of one of the most popular dance bands in the United States during the 1920s and early 1930s, Whiteman produced recordings that were immensely successful, and press notices often referred to him as the &quot;King of Jazz&quot;. His most popular recordings include &quot;Whispering&quot;, &quot;Valencia&quot;, &quot;Three O&#x27;Clock in the Morning&quot;, &quot;In a Little Spanish Town&quot;, and &quot;Parade of the Wooden Soldiers&quot;. Whiteman led a usually large ensemble and explored many styles of music, such as blending symphonic music and jazz, as in his debut of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; by George Gershwin.

Whiteman recorded many jazz and pop standards during his career, including &quot;Wang Wang Blues&quot;, &quot;Mississippi Mud&quot;, &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, &quot;Wonderful One&quot;, &quot;Hot Lips (He&#x27;s Got Hot Lips When He Plays Jazz)&quot;, &quot;Mississippi Suite&quot;, &quot;Grand Canyon Suite&quot;, and &quot;Trav&#x27;lin&#x27; Light&quot;. He co-wrote the 1925 jazz classic &quot;Flamin&#x27; Mamie&quot;. His popularity faded in the swing music era of the mid-1930s, and by the 1940s he was semi-retired from music. He experienced a revival and had a comeback in the 1950s with his own network television series, &quot;Paul Whiteman&#x27;s Goodyear Revue&quot;, which ran for three seasons on ABC. He also hosted the 1954 ABC talent contest show &quot;On the Boardwalk with Paul Whiteman&quot;.

Whiteman&#x27;s place in the history of early jazz is somewhat controversial. Detractors suggest that his ornately orchestrated music was jazz in name only, lacking the genre&#x27;s improvisational and emotional depth, and co-opted the innovations of black musicians. Historians however note that Whiteman&#x27;s fondness for jazz was genuine. He worked with black musicians as much as was feasible during an era of racial segregation. His bands included many of the era&#x27;s most esteemed white musicians, and his groups handled jazz admirably as part of a larger repertoire.

Critic Scott Yanow declares that Whiteman&#x27;s orchestra &quot;did play very good jazz...His superior dance band used some of the most technically skilled musicians of the era in a versatile show that included everything from pop tunes and waltzes to semi-classical works and jazz. [...] Many of his recordings (particularly those with Bix Beiderbecke) have been reissued numerous times and are more rewarding than his detractors would lead one to believe.&quot;

In his autobiography, Duke Ellington declared, &quot;Paul Whiteman was known as the King of Jazz, and no one as yet has come near carrying that title with more certainty and dignity.&quot;

==Early life==

Whiteman was born in Denver, Colorado. He came from a musical family: his father, Wilburforce James Whiteman was the supervisor of music for the Denver Public Schools, a position he held for fifty years, and his mother Elfrida (née Dallison) was a former opera singer. His father insisted that Paul learn an instrument, preferably the violin, but the young man chose the viola. Whiteman was Protestant and of Scottish, Irish, English, and Dutch ancestry.

==Career==
Whiteman&#x27;s skill at the viola resulted in a place in the Denver Symphony Orchestra by 1907, joining the San Francisco Symphony in 1914. In 1918, Whiteman conducted a 12-piece U.S. Navy band, the Mare Island Naval Training Camp Symphony Orchestra (NTCSO). After World War I, he formed the Paul Whiteman Orchestra.

That year he led a popular dance band in the city. In 1920, he moved with his band to New York City where they began recording for the Victor Talking Machine Company. The popularity of these records led to national fame. In his first five recordings sessions for Victor, August 9 – October 28, 1920, he used the name &quot;Paul Whiteman and His Ambassador Orchestra&quot;, presumably because he had been playing at the Ambassador Hotel in Atlantic City. From November 3, 1920, he started using &quot;Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra.&quot;

Whiteman became the most popular band director of that decade. In a time when most dance bands consisted of six to ten men, Whiteman directed a more imposing group that numbered as many as 35 musicians. By 1922, Whiteman already controlled some 28 ensembles on the East Coast and was earning over $1,000,000 a year.

In 1926, Paul Whiteman was on tour in Vienna, Austria when he met and was interviewed by a young ambitious newspaper reporter named Billy Wilder who was also a fan of Whiteman&#x27;s band. Whiteman liked young Wilder enough, that he took him with the band to Berlin where Wilder was able to make more connections in the entertainment field, leading him to become a screenwriter and director, eventually ending up in Hollywood.

In 1927, the Whiteman orchestra backed Hoagy Carmichael singing and playing on a recording of &quot;Washboard Blues&quot;. Whiteman signed with Columbia Records in May 1928, leaving the label in September 1930 when he refused a pay cut. He returned to RCA Victor between September 1931 and March 1937.

===&quot;The King of Jazz&quot;===
Beginning in 1923 after the Buescher Band Instrument Company placed a crown on his head, the media referred to Whiteman as &quot;The King of Jazz&quot;. Whiteman emphasized the way he approached the well-established style of jazz music, while also organizing its composition and style in his own fashion.

While most jazz musicians and fans consider improvisation to be essential to the musical style, Whiteman thought the genre could be improved by orchestrating the best of it, with formal written arrangements. Eddie Condon criticized him for trying to &quot;make a lady&quot; out of jazz. Whiteman&#x27;s recordings were popular critically and commercially, and his style of jazz was often the first jazz of any form that many Americans heard during the era. Whiteman wrote more than 3000 arrangements.

For more than 30 years Whiteman, referred to as &quot;Pops&quot;, sought and encouraged promising musicians, vocalists, composers, arrangers, and entertainers. In 1924 he commissioned George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, which was premiered by his orchestra with the composer at the piano. Another familiar piece in Whiteman&#x27;s repertoire was &quot;Grand Canyon Suite&quot; by Ferde Grofé.

=== Paul Whiteman And His Orchestra ===
Whiteman hired many of the best jazz musicians for his band, including Bix Beiderbecke, Frankie Trumbauer, Joe Venuti, Eddie Lang, Steve Brown, Mike Pingitore, Gussie Mueller, Wilbur Hall (billed by Whiteman as &quot;Willie Hall&quot;), Jack Teagarden, and Bunny Berigan. He encouraged upcoming African American musical talents and planned to hire black musicians, but his management persuaded him that doing so would destroy his career, due to racial tension and America&#x27;s segregation of that time.
In 1925, seeking to break up his musical selections, Whiteman&#x27;s attention was directed by a member of his organisation to Bing Crosby and Al Rinker, who would perform as members of his orchestra, and later, as two of the three frontmen of The Rhythm Boys.

He provided music for six Broadway shows and produced more than 600 phonograph recordings. His recording of José Padilla&#x27;s &quot;Valencia&quot; was a big hit in 1926.

Red McKenzie, leader of the Mound City Blue Blowers, and cabaret singer Ramona Davies (billed as &quot;Ramona and her Grand Piano&quot;) joined the Whiteman group in 1932. The King&#x27;s Jesters were with Paul Whiteman in 1931. In 1933, Whiteman had a hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts with Ann Ronell&#x27;s &quot;Willow Weep for Me&quot;.

In 1942, Whiteman began recording for Capitol Records, co-founded by songwriters Buddy DeSylva and Johnny Mercer and music store owner Glenn Wallichs. Whiteman and His Orchestra&#x27;s recordings of &quot;I Found a New Baby&quot; and &quot;The General Jumped at Dawn&quot; was the label&#x27;s first single release. Another notable Capitol record he made is the 1942 &quot;Trav&#x27;lin Light&quot; featuring Billie Holiday (billed as &quot;Lady Day&quot;, due to her being under contract with another label).

===Film appearances===
Whiteman appeared as himself in the 1945 movie &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; on the life and career of George Gershwin, and also appeared in &quot;The Fabulous Dorseys&quot; in 1947, a bio-pic starring Jimmy Dorsey and Tommy Dorsey. Whiteman also appeared as the baby in &quot;Nertz&quot; (1929), the bandleader in &quot;Thanks a Million&quot; (1935), as himself in &quot;Strike Up the Band&quot; (1940), in the Paramount Pictures short &quot;The Lambertville Story&quot; (1949), and the revue musical &quot;King of Jazz&quot; (1930). Whiteman also appeared in a 1930 Oswald the Lucky Rabbit short entitled &quot;My Pal Paul&quot;.

===Radio and TV===
Although giving priority to stage appearances during his peak years in the 1920s, Whiteman participated in some early prestigious radio programs. On January 4, 1928, Whiteman and his troupe starred in a nationwide NBC radio broadcast sponsored by Dodge Brothers Automobile Co. and known as &quot;The Victory Hour&quot; (The program introduced the new Dodge &quot;Victory Six&quot; automobile). It was the most widespread hookup ever attempted at that time. Will Rogers acted as MC and joined the program from the West Coast, with Al Jolson coming in from New Orleans. Variety was not impressed, saying: &quot;As with practically all of the important and high-priced commercial broadcasting programs under N.B.C. auspices in the past, the Dodge Brothers&#x27; Victory Hour at a reputed cost of $67,000 was disappointing and not commensurate in impression with the financial outlay.&quot; However, the magazine noted. &quot;...The reaction to Paul Whiteman&#x27;s grand radio plug for &quot;Among My Souvenirs&quot;…was a flock of orders by wire from dealers the day following the Dodge Brothers Victory Hour broadcast.&quot;

On March 29, 1928, Whiteman took part in a second Dodge Brothers radio show over the NBC network, which was entitled &quot;Film Star Radio Hour&quot;. Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, John Barrymore, and several other Hollywood stars were featured. United Artists Pictures arranged for additional loudspeakers to be installed in their theatres so that audiences could hear the stars they had only seen in silent pictures previously. The New York Herald Tribune commented: &quot;...Of Mr. Paul Whiteman&#x27;s share in the pretentious program, only the best can be said. Mr. Whiteman&#x27;s orchestra is seldom heard on the radio, and its infrequent broadcasts are the subject of major jubilations, despite the presence of tenors and vocal harmonists in most of the Whiteman renditions.&quot;

In 1929, Whiteman agreed to take part in a weekly radio show for Old Gold Cigarettes for which he was paid $5,000 per broadcast. &quot;Old Gold Presents Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra&quot; was an hour-long show on Tuesday nights over CBS from station WABC in New York. &quot;The Whiteman Hour&quot; had its first broadcast on February 5, 1929, and continued until May 6, 1930. On May 7, 1930, he was paid $325,000 for 65 radio episodes.

Whiteman then became far busier in radio. His shows were:
*January 27, 1931 – July 1, 1932, Blue Network. 30m, Tuesdays at 8, then Fridays at 10. Allied Paints (1931), Pontiac (1932).

With Bob Lawrence, Johnny Hauser, Morton Downey, Durelle Alexander, songs by the King&#x27;s Men, and announcer Roy Bargy. The show featured a children&#x27;s amateur contest. Near the end of the run Whiteman introduced comedian Judy Canova, who inherited timeslot and sponsor in the Woodbury Rippling Rhythm Revue.
*December 31, 1937 – December 20, 1939, CBS. 30m. Fridays at 8:30 until mid–July 1938, then Wednesdays at 8:30. &quot;Chesterfield Time&quot;, with Joan Edwards, Deems Taylor (musical commentary) and announcer Paul Douglas. Whiteman took over the slot vacated by Hal Kemp and two years later vacated it for the sensational new Glenn Miller orchestra.

*June 27 – November 7, 1950, ABC. 30m, Tuesdays at 8. &quot;Paul Whiteman Presents&quot;.
*October 29, 1951 – April 28, 1953, ABC. Various times. &quot;Paul Whiteman&#x27;s Teen Club&quot;. An amateur hour with the accent on youth.
*February 4 – October 20, 1954. ABC. 30m. Thursdays at 9 until July, then Wednesdays at 9:30. &quot;Paul Whiteman Varieties&quot;.

In the 1940s and 1950s, after he had disbanded his orchestra, Whiteman worked as a music director for the ABC Radio Network. He also hosted &quot;Paul Whiteman&#x27;s TV Teen Club&quot; from Philadelphia on ABC-TV from 1949 to 1954. The show was seen for an hour the first two years, then as a half-hour segment on Saturday evenings. In 1952 a young Dick Clark read the commercials for sponsor Tootsie Roll. Whiteman&#x27;s &quot;TV-Teen Club&quot;, along with Grady and Hurst&#x27;s &quot;950 Club&quot;, proved to be an inspiration for WFIL-TV&#x27;s afternoon dance show called &quot;American Bandstand&quot;.

He also continued to appear as guest conductor for many concerts. His manner on stage was disarming; he signed off each program with something casual like, &quot;Well, that just about slaps the cap on the old milk bottle for tonight.&quot; In the early 1960s, Whiteman played in Las Vegas before retiring.

==Personal life and death==
On August 18, 1931, Whiteman married for the fourth and final time to actress Margaret Livingston in a ceremony in Denver, Colorado. Livingston was unable to have children, and the couple adopted four.

Whiteman lived at Walking Horse Farm near the village of Rosemont in Delaware Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey, from 1938 to 1959. After selling the farm to agriculturalist Lloyd Wescott, Whiteman moved to New Hope, Pennsylvania, for his remaining years.

Paul Whiteman died of a heart attack on December 29, 1967, in Doylestown Hospital, Doylestown, Pennsylvania, aged 77. He is buried at First Presbyterian Church of Ewing Cemetery in Trenton, New Jersey. 

===Motorsports===
Whiteman was a close friend of NASCAR and Daytona International Speedway founder Bill France.

On June 13, 1954, the #4 Jaguar XK120, driven by Al Keller, won the International 100 race of the Grand National series, held on a one mile road course on the airport at Vineland, New Jersey. This was the first, and so far only, victory by a European car in NASCAR&#x27;s top series. The car was owned by Ed Otto, race promoter and co-founder of NASCAR, but was entered under the ownership of Whiteman to avoid issues arising from conflicts of interest - Keller won a $1,000 first prize, and Whiteman&#x27;s registration as owner survives in archives.

The #7 Cadillac owned by Whiteman ran in five Nascar Grand National races during the 1954 season, with future Hall of Famer Junior Johnson driving in three and Gwyn Staley driving in two. In the 1955 season, it ran in one race with Junior Johnson driving.

&quot;Paul Whiteman Trophy&quot; races, arranged by the Central Florida Region SCCA, were held from 1958 until 1972. The 1958 event was held at the New Smyrna Beach Airport, and from 1961, it was held annually at the Daytona Speedway.

==Songs==

The Paul Whiteman Orchestra introduced many jazz standards in the 1920s, including &quot;Hot Lips&quot;, which was in the Steven Spielberg movie &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (1985), &quot;Mississippi Mud&quot;, &quot;From Monday On&quot;, written by Harry Barris and sung by the Rhythm Boys featuring Bing Crosby and Irene Taylor with Bix Beiderbecke on cornet, &quot;Nuthin&#x27; But&quot;, &quot;Grand Canyon Suite&quot; and &quot;Mississippi Suite&quot; composed by Ferde Grofé, &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, composed by George Gershwin who played piano on the Paul Whiteman recording in 1924, &quot;Wonderful One&quot; (1923), and &quot;Wang Wang Blues&quot; (1920), covered by Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, and Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver&#x27;s Dixie Syncopators in 1926 and many of the Big Bands. &quot;Hot Lips&quot; was recorded by Ted Lewis and His Jazz Band, Horace Heidt and His Brigadiers Orchestra (1937), Specht&#x27;s Jazz Outfit, the Cotton Pickers (1922), and Django Reinhardt et Le Quintette Du Hot Club De France.

Paul Whiteman was the first to release the jazz and pop standard &quot;Deep Purple&quot; as an instrumental in 1934.

==Compositions==
Whiteman composed the standard &quot;Wonderful One&quot; in 1922 with Ferde Grofé and Dorothy Terris (also known as Theodora Morse), based on a theme by film director Marshall Neilan. The songwriting credit is assigned as music composed by Paul Whiteman, Ferde Grofé, and Marshall Neilan, with lyrics by Dorothy Terriss. The single reached No. 3 on Billboard in May 1923, staying on the charts for 5 weeks. &quot;(My) Wonderful One&quot; was recorded by Gertrude Moody, Edward Miller, Martha Pryor, Mel Torme, Doris Day, Woody Herman, Helen Moretti, John McCormack; it was released as Victor 961. Jan Garber and His Orchestra, and Ira Sullivan with Tony Castellano also recorded the song. Henry Burr recorded it in 1924 and Glenn Miller and his Orchestra in 1940.

<text>Hudson Hawk is a 1991 American action comedy film directed by Michael Lehmann. Bruce Willis stars in the title role and also co-wrote the story. Danny Aiello, Andie MacDowell, James Coburn, David Caruso, Lorraine Toussaint, Frank Stallone, Sandra Bernhard, and Richard E. Grant are also featured.

The live action film employs cartoon-style slapstick heavily, including sound effects, which enhances the film&#x27;s signature surreal humor. The plot combines material based on conspiracy theories, secret societies, and historic mysteries, as well as outlandish &quot;clockpunk&quot; technology &quot;à la&quot; Coburn&#x27;s &quot;Our Man Flint&quot; films of the 1960s.

A recurring plot device in the film has Hudson and his partner Tommy &quot;Five-Tone&quot; (Aiello) singing songs concurrently but separately, to time and synchronize their exploits. Willis-Aiello duets of Bing Crosby&#x27;s &quot;Swinging on a Star&quot; and Paul Anka&#x27;s &quot;Side by Side&quot; are featured on the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

The film was a huge critical and commercial failure in the United States, only grossing $17 million and earning three Razzies (including Worst Picture), but it was better received internationally and grossed $80 million for a worldwide total of $97 million.

==Plot==
Eddie Hawkins—&quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; (from the bracing winds off the Hudson)—is a master cat burglar and safe-cracker with a penchant for using low-tech solutions against high-tech security systems and for conducting his robberies with precise, synchronized timing (later revealed to be a robust catalog of memorized music that he and his partner(s) sing along with during jobs).

Upon Hawk&#x27;s release and his first day of parole, he and his former partner, Tommy &quot;Five-Tone&quot; Messina, seek out a good cup of cappuccino. However, before Hawk can get it, he is blackmailed by various entities. These include his parole officer, the minor Mario Brothers Mafia family, and the CIA, who push him into doing a few art heists.

Hawk refuses each, despite mounting pressure and coercion, stating that his only natural desires are to remain out of prison and enjoy a good cup of cappuccino—though he is repeatedly interrupted before doing so. Hawk eventually relents and proceeds to case the art pieces.

Unbeknownst to Hawk, his blackmailers are all manipulated by the American corporation Mayflower Industries, run by husband and wife Darwin and Minerva Mayflower and their butler Alfred. Headquartered in the Esposizione Universale Roma, the company seeks to take over the world by building La Macchina dell&#x27;Oro, a machine invented by Leonardo da Vinci that converts lead into gold.

An assembly of crystals needed for the machine to function is hidden in various of Leonardo&#x27;s artworks: the maquette of the Sforza, the Da Vinci Codex, and a scale model of da Vinci&#x27;s helicopter. Sister Anna Baragli is an operative for a secret Vatican counter-espionage agency, working with the CIA to assist in Hawk&#x27;s mission in Rome, intending to foil the robbery at St. Peter&#x27;s.

After blowing up an auctioneer to cover up the theft of the Sforza, the Mario Bros. take Hawk away in an ambulance. He sticks syringes into Antony Mario&#x27;s face and falls out of the ambulance on a gurney on the Brooklyn Bridge, and they try to run him down with the ambulance as they speed along the highway.

The brothers get killed when their ambulance crashes. Immediately afterward, Hawk meets CIA head George Kaplan and four codenamed agents (Snickers, Kit Kat, Almond Joy, and Butterfinger) who take him to the Mayflowers.

Hawk successfully steals the Da Vinci Codex from another museum, but later refuses to steal the helicopter design. Tommy Five-Tone fakes his death so they can escape. They are discovered and attacked by the CIA agents; Kaplan reveals that he and his agents stole the piece but, unlike them, had no problem killing the guards. Hawk and Tommy escape when Snickers and Almond Joy are killed and pursue the remaining agents. Kit Kat and Butterfinger take Anna to the castle where the Macchina dell&#x27;Oro is reconstructed.

The showdown is in the castle between the remaining CIA agents, the Mayflowers, and the team of Hudson, Five-Tone, and Baragli. Minerva kills Kit Kat and Butterfinger, although Kit Kat frees Baragli before dying. Tommy fights Darwin and Alfred inside a speeding limousine, and Hudson fights George Kaplan on the castle&#x27;s roof. Kaplan topples from the castle, landing on the limousine. Alfred plants a bomb in it, escaping with Darwin; Tommy gets trapped inside while Kaplan is hanging onto the hood. The bomb detonates as the limousine speeds over a cliff.

Darwin and Minerva force Hawk to assemble the crystal powering the machine, but he intentionally leaves out one small piece. When the machine is activated, it malfunctions and explodes, killing the Mayflowers. Hawk battles Alfred, using his blades to decapitate him.

Hawk and Baragli escape the castle using the da Vinci flying machine. They discover Tommy waiting for them at a café, having miraculously escaped death through a combination of airbags and a sprinkler system in the limo. With the world saved and da Vinci&#x27;s secrets protected, Hawk finally enjoys a cappuccino.

==Cast==
==Production==
Before Bruce Willis became a full-time actor, he had worked at a bar in New York City. One of the regulars at the bar was Robert Kraft, who worked with Willis on putting a song together called &quot;The Hudson Hawk&quot;, with Kraft being inspired by a strong wind that blew from the Hudson River across Manhattan in the fall. Eventually, when Willis became a star, he went back to the idea of doing a super sleuth film, one that Kraft thought could be &quot;the anti-James Bond&quot; with potential for follow-up films. Joel Silver, who had produced Willis with the first two &quot;Die Hard&quot; films, jumped on producing this film. Maruschka Detmers was originally cast opposite Willis but suffered a back injury and had to depart the role, which saw Andie MacDowell cast. Michael Lehmann, director of films such as &quot;Heathers&quot; (which had been written by Daniel Waters, who was hired to co-write the screenplay), envisioned Richard E. Grant and Sandra Bernhard as playing manic villains, with one basis of inspiration being Silver. The budget reportedly went from $42 million to around $70 million to go with constant on-set rewriting and rumors of turbulence with producer-star Willis; it was shot in Italy, England, and Hungary. Grant, who spent four months on the production, wrote about his experiences making the films in his book &quot;With Nails&quot;, listing various stories such as Willis continuously watching his close-ups on the video replay monitors on takes to go with co-star Danny Aiello wanting re-writes for the climax.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack album was released by Varèse Sarabande in 1991. There are eleven tracks in all. The film&#x27;s score (represented by tracks 4-9) was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen with Robert Kraft. Kraft also wrote &quot;Hawk Swing&quot; and co-wrote the film&#x27;s theme with star Bruce Willis.

The song &quot;The Power&quot; by Snap! is featured, although not included on the soundtrack, when Hudson Hawk is taken for the first time to the headquarters of the Mayflowers. Minerva Mayflower, played by Sandra Bernhard, is sitting on a desk and sings the song while it plays on her headphones.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 31% based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6 out of 10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus: &quot;&quot;Hudson Hawk&quot;&#x27;s kitchen-sink approach to its blend of action and slapstick results in a surreal, baffling misfire.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 17 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Terry Clifford observed that: &quot;The end result is being thrown up on &quot;selected&quot; screens this weekend, and the suspicion that this was a pooch turns out to be undeniably correct. Boring and banal, overwrought and undercooked, &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; is beyond bad.&quot;

As Kenneth Turan wrote in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;:
Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel gave the film a &quot;two thumbs down&quot; review on their &quot;At the Movies&quot; TV show. Ebert described the film as a complete disaster: &quot;every line starts from zero and gets nowhere&quot;. Siskel&#x27;s review was marginally more positive, saying that Willis had a few funny moments and furthermore that the film might have been salvaged if Willis and Aiello had been the only zany characters against a cast of straight men, as opposed to a cast full of overacting, where everyone tried too hard to make each line funny.

&quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a relentlessly annoying clay duck that crash-lands in a sea of wretched excess and silliness. Those willing to check their brains at the door may find sparse amusement.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said of the film: &quot;A movie this unspeakably awful can make an audience a little crazy. You want to throw things, yell at the actors, beg them to stop.&quot; James Brundage of &quot;AMC filmcritic&quot; said the film was &quot;so implausible and so over the top that it lets inconsistency roll off like water on a duck&#x27;s back.&quot; Janet Maslin in the &quot;New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a colossally sour and ill-conceived misfire&quot; and denounced the film for &quot;smirky, mean-spirited cynicism.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Joe Brown said: &quot;To say this megamillion Bruce Willis vehicle doesn&#x27;t fly is understatement in the extreme... &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; offers a klutzy, charmless hero, and wallows dully in limp slapstick and lowest common denominator crudeness.&quot; Chris Hicks wrote in the &quot;Salt Lake City Deseret News&quot;: &quot;What is most amazing is the pervasive silliness that has the cast acting like fools without ever getting a laugh from the audience. It&#x27;s hard to imagine a major, big-budget movie that could come along this year and be worse than &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot;, a solid contender for the longest 95 minutes in movie history. Owen Gleiberman in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the film &quot;a fiasco sealed with a smirk.&quot;

Jo Berry from &quot;Empire&quot; gave it three out of five stars, noting that it &quot;reached UK screens with the added burden of having been slaughtered by US critics who likened it to famous big budget turkeys like &quot;Raise The Titanic&quot; and &quot;Ishtar&quot;. True, the film has its flaws, but the positives do outweigh the negatives, with Bruce Willis at his wisecracking best in the title role.&quot;

Jane Lamacraft reassessed the film as one of the &quot;Forgotten Pleasures of the Multiplex&quot; for &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;&#x27;s June 2011 magazine.

===Box office===
The film performed poorly in the United States, partly because the film was intended as an absurd comedy, yet was marketed as an action film one year after the success of &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;. It grossed only $17 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally, it performed much better, grossing $80 million for a worldwide total of $97 million. By the end of its theatrical run, the film had lost the studio an estimated $90 million.

The film performed well on home video and by 1995 started to pay out to profit participants, including Bruce Willis.

===Accolades===
It received three 1991 Golden Raspberry Awards for Director (Lehmann), Screenplay and Picture with additional nominations for Actor (Willis), Supporting Actor (Grant), and Supporting Actress (Bernhard). It was also nominated for Worst Picture at the 1991 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, losing to &quot;Nothing but Trouble&quot;.

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS and LaserDisc in late 1991. Upon its home video release, the tagline &quot;Catch the Excitement, Catch the Adventure, Catch the Hawk&quot; was changed to &quot;Catch the Adventure, Catch The Laughter, Catch the Hawk&quot;. Despite the film&#x27;s failure at the US box office, the film was successful on home video.

It was released twice on DVD, first in 1999 and again in 2007 with new extras. In 2013, Mill Creek Entertainment released &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; on Blu-ray for the first time; it was included in a set with &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot;. All extras were dropped for the latter release.

==Video game==
A video game based on the film was released in 1991 under the title &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; for various home computers and game consoles. Sony Imagesoft released versions of the game for the NES and Game Boy, while Ocean Software released it for the Commodore 64, Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Atari ST. It is a side-scrolling game where the player, as the Hawk, must steal the Sforza and the Codex from the auction house and the Vatican, respectively. Then, Castle Da Vinci has to be infiltrated in order to steal the mirrored crystal needed to power the gold machine. On his journey, Hawk must face many oddball adversaries, including dachshunds that try to throw him off the roof of the auction house, janitors, photographers, killer nuns and a tennis player (presumably Darwin Mayflower).

<text>Christopher Pike is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction franchise. He is the immediate predecessor to James T. Kirk as captain of the starship .

Pike first appeared as the main character of the original unaired pilot episode for &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, &quot;The Cage&quot;, portrayed by Jeffrey Hunter. When this pilot was rejected, Hunter withdrew from the series, and the character of Pike was replaced with Kirk. The series later established Pike as being Kirk&#x27;s predecessor in the two-part story &quot;The Menagerie&quot;, which extensively used archive footage from &quot;The Cage&quot;; the framing story included an older, scarred, and disabled Fleet Captain Pike portrayed by Sean Kenney.

The films &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009) and &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; (2013), which take place in an alternate timeline, feature Bruce Greenwood as a version of Pike who acts as a mentor to the young Kirk. Christopher Pike is a main character in the second season of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; (broadcast 2019), portrayed by Anson Mount; set several years after &quot;The Cage&quot;, the show has Captain Pike assume temporary command of the USS &quot;Discovery&quot;. The series &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; (2022–present), a spinoff of &quot;Discovery&quot;, is centered on Pike&#x27;s time as captain of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, with Mount reprising the role.

== Biography ==
According to dialogue in &quot;The Cage&quot;, he is from the city of Mojave, California and once owned a horse named Tango.

Pike is the second captain of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; NCC-1701 and the first to be shown in &quot;Star Trek&quot; canon. &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; reveals that Captain Robert April predated Pike, and printed &quot;Star Trek&quot; fiction and reference books also identify April as Pike&#x27;s predecessor. Pike took command of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the year 2250, at the age of 38, taking over command from Robert April, who commanded the &quot;Enterprise&quot; for five years.

== Appearances ==
=== Television ===
==== &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; ====
; &quot;The Cage&quot;
At the beginning of &quot;The Cage&quot;, set in the year 2254, Pike and his crew are recuperating from a mission to Rigel VII during which several members of the landing party were killed by the inhabitants. The incident filled Pike with so much guilt that he is considering resigning his commission.

Meanwhile, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is en route to Vega Colony to drop off wounded crew members when it receives a distress call from the survey vessel SS &quot;Columbia&quot;, lost eighteen years previously. Pike initially refuses to investigate, citing that the injured crew members take priority. However, when an abbreviated follow-up message is received, he orders the ship diverted to Talos IV to rescue survivors.

Pike soon learns that all but one of the survivors are illusions created by the Talosians in order to lure the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew to Talos IV. The Talosians make every effort to provide fantasies that they hope will appeal to Pike, using Vina, the only real &quot;Columbia&quot; survivor, as the object of desire. After Pike escapes from his prison cell with the aid of his first officer, Number One, and Yeoman J. M. Colt, the Talosians reveal, to Pike, Vina&#x27;s real appearance as a disfigured older woman. The Talosians saved her life after the &quot;Columbia&quot; crashed, but they had no guide on how to repair a human body. Pike requests that the Talosians restore her illusion of beauty and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; leaves Talos IV.

; &quot;The Menagerie&quot;
At some point prior to the two-part episode &quot;The Menagerie&quot;, set in the year 2267, Pike is promoted to fleet captain. He is severely injured while rescuing several cadets from a baffle plate rupture on board a J-class training vessel, the delta ray radiation leaving him paralyzed, unable to speak, badly scarred, and using a brainwave-operated wheelchair for mobility. His only means of communicating is through a light on the chair: one flash meaning &quot;yes&quot; and two flashes indicating &quot;no&quot;.

In &quot;The Menagerie&quot;, the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, now under the command of Captain James T. Kirk, travels to Starbase 11. Spock, who had served with Pike for &quot;eleven years, four months, and five days&quot;, makes clandestine arrangements to take Pike back to Talos IV, despite travel to Talos IV being the only criminal offense still punishable by death in Starfleet. Spock undergoes court-martial, with his evidence presented during the trial being footage from &quot;The Cage&quot;. At the two-part episode&#x27;s conclusion, it is revealed that the entire procedure was a Talosian-generated illusion to ensure that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; reached Talos. The Talosians invite Captain Pike to spend the remainder of his life among them, &quot;unfettered by his natural body&quot;, which was the entire purpose of Spock&#x27;s actions. Pike accepts the offer and Spock, now cleared of all charges, sees him off. The Talosians then show Captain Kirk an image of Pike in perfect health and reunited with Vina (another scene from &quot;The Cage&quot;).

==== &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; ====

Prior to appearing on &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; as a main character, Pike is referenced twice in the show&#x27;s first season. The episode &quot;Choose Your Pain&quot; has Pike listed on the Starfleet Database as one of Starfleet&#x27;s most decorated Captains as of 2256. (Also included in the list are Jonathan Archer, Matt Decker, Philippa Georgiou and Robert April.) The season finale &quot;Will You Take My Hand?&quot; shows the &quot;Enterprise&quot; on-screen, with Pike sending a distress call to the &quot;Discovery&quot;. Anson Mount being cast as Captain Pike for the second season was announced on April 9, 2018.

Captain Christopher Pike was introduced to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; in the second-season premiere, &quot;Brother&quot;, which first aired in the U.S. on January 17, 2019. Set in the years 2257–2258, the season-long story arc involves Pike assuming temporary command of the USS &quot;Discovery&quot; while the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is disabled, in order to investigate the mysterious &quot;red signals&quot; – temporal anomalies appearing throughout space that have some connection to the apparent breakdown and disappearance of Spock. The planet Talos IV reappears in the episode &quot;If Memory Serves&quot;, which also has Pike and Vina once again making mental contact. In the episode &quot;Through the Valley of Shadows&quot;, Pike receives a premonition of his own future including his injury and disfigurement. He is forced to choose between taking a time crystal from Boreth which would solve the red signal crisis at the cost of his disability in the future or risking the fate of the galaxy. He chooses to remain loyal to Starfleet ideals and accept his future injuries. Pike departs the show in the season finale &quot;Such Sweet Sorrow, Part 2&quot;, first aired 18 April 2019, which shows him relinquishing command of the USS &quot;Discovery&quot; to Saru, who solves the crisis by taking the ship 930 years into the future. Pike reunites with Spock and chooses to resume command of the &quot;Enterprise,&quot; knowing his future but enjoying the present.

==== &quot;Star Trek: Short Treks&quot; ====
Anson Mount reprised his role as Pike in the first three episodes of the second season of the anthology series &quot;Star Trek: Short Treks&quot;. originally airing October 5 to November 14, 2019.

====&quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;====
After Anson Mount left &quot;Discovery&quot; following the second-season finale, fans of the series began calling for him to reprise his role of Christopher Pike in a spin-off set on the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, alongside Rebecca Romijn as Number One and Ethan Peck as Spock. Alex Kurtzman confirmed that development on such a series had begun in January 2020. Production began on the series in February 2021, and the series premiered in May 2022.

In the first season, Pike undergoes a crisis of faith concerning his future injuries. He spends much of the season debating and grappling with the forthcoming incident. When he encounters a child who will become one of the cadets he will fail to save, Pike attempts to alter the timeline to save everyone and himself. However, his future self Admiral Pike appears with a time crystal to reveal that averting his fate leads to an alternate timeline where the events of “Balance of Terror” took place with Pike, not Kirk, helming the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Pike&#x27;s pacifist approach to the Romulan incursion encourages a full-scale Romulan invasion, causing Spock to suffer grievous injuries and plunging the Federation into a decades-long war. Ultimately, Pike comes to the realization that he can do nothing to change his fate.

=== Reboot (&quot;Kelvin Timeline&quot;) Films ===
==== &quot;Star Trek&quot; ====

Captain Pike appears in the reboot &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009), this time portrayed by Bruce Greenwood. In the film, Pike encourages a young, directionless James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) to follow in the footsteps of his hero father and enlist in Starfleet. Pike is the first Captain of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, with the then deselected, cadet Kirk on board as a stowaway. In the culmination of the Battle of Vulcan, Pike follows an ultimatum of Nero (Eric Bana) to board the enemy ship. Pike leaves Spock in command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; with the words: &quot;And I&#x27;m not the captain. You are.&quot; (Kirk later assumes Spock&#x27;s role of acting captain.) Pike is tortured for information about Earth&#x27;s defenses but is later rescued by Kirk, whom Pike also manages to save from an attack despite his wounds. At the end of the film, Pike is promoted to the rank of admiral and uses a wheelchair. Unlike his counterpart in &quot;The Menagerie&quot;, however, Pike still retains the ability to speak and to use his upper body. He proudly yields command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to Kirk while he recovers from his injuries, stating that Kirk&#x27;s father would be proud of his actions.

==== &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; ====
Greenwood reprised his role as Pike in the next film, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;. In the film, Pike has partially recovered from the trauma Nero inflicted, using a cane rather than a wheelchair. After Kirk violates the Prime Directive to rescue Spock (Zachary Quinto), Pike briefly retakes command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and warns Kirk that the Admiralty is threatening to put him back into the academy. Pike confronts Kirk about his reckless behavior and how his own actions can get those nearest to him killed. Despite his anger at Kirk, however, Pike retains him as his First Officer, sparing him from having to return to the academy. He later explains to Kirk that he still believes in him and that he also sees a &quot;greatness&quot; behind his recklessness. During a meeting with the Starfleet commanders, including veteran Admiral Marcus and Captain Kirk, Pike is killed in a terrorist attack on Starfleet by John Harrison. Pike&#x27;s death incites a desire for revenge in Kirk, who seeks to hunt down Harrison, nearly bringing the Federation into a full-scale war with the Klingons. At the end of the film, a memorial service is held for Pike and all of the other people who died as a result of Admiral Marcus and Harrison&#x27;s actions.

===Later references===
Pike is referenced in the episode &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;. An alternate-universe version of Captain Kirk reportedly assassinated Pike to become captain of the ISS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (the Mirror Universe version of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;).

In the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Most Toys&quot;, the name &quot;Pike&quot; can be seen briefly on the side of the shuttlecraft Lt. Commander Data was going to pilot at the beginning of the episode.

A citation named for Pike is revealed in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Tears of the Prophets&quot;; Captain Benjamin Sisko receives the &quot;Christopher Pike Medal of Valor&quot; for his actions during the Dominion War. Captain Sisko and his Vulcan rival Captain Solok congratulate each other on receiving &quot;Christopher Pike Medal&quot; in the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Take Me Out to the Holosuite&quot; (S07E04).

====Comics====
; &quot;Star Trek: Early Voyages&quot;
In the Paramount-licensed &quot;Star Trek&quot; comic book series published by Marvel Comics, &quot;Star Trek: Early Voyages&quot; chronicled the adventures of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; under the command of Pike. The earliest issues lead up to the events seen in &quot;The Cage&quot;, which was retold from Yeoman Colt&#x27;s point of view. Although extremely popular, the comic series ended on a cliffhanger when Marvel lost the &quot;Star Trek&quot; license rights.

; &quot;Star Trek Annual&quot; #2 – &quot;The Final Voyage&quot; (DC comics, 1986)
In this issue, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; tries to return home to Earth only to find itself around Talos IV. They discover that the Klingons have gone to the planet reasoning anything that scared the Federation enough to maintain the death penalty could be used as a weapon. While on the surface they also discover two Klingons torturing Pike, who is back in his chair due to the Klingons having partially mastered the Talosian&#x27;s mind powers. One of the Klingons then tortures the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; by making them live their worst fears. Kirk, forced to relive the death of Edith Keeler, goes berserk with rage and breaks the illusion. Kirk then beats the Klingon tormenting them to death with his bare hands. The crew quickly free the Talosians, who mentally imprison the Klingons in illusions of peaceful, tranquil settings as they purge their memories of Talos IV. The crew returns home with Pike remaining on Talos IV to continue his illusionary life.

;&quot;Starfleet Academy&quot; comic series
In the Paramount-licensed &quot;Star Trek&quot; comic book series published by Marvel Comics, &quot;Starfleet Academy&quot;, Nog and some fellow cadets encounter a solid image of Pike on Talos IV.

; &quot;Star Trek Captain&#x27;s Log: Pike&quot; (IDW Publishing, 2010)
&quot;Captain&#x27;s Log: Pike&quot; published by IDW details the events leading up to and including Pike becoming disabled from the baffle plate rupture aboard the USS &quot;Exeter&quot; (NCC-1788) under the watch of Captain Colt, Pike&#x27;s former yeoman on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The story also reveals Colt&#x27;s unrequited love for her former Captain.

=== Pop Culture ===
; Fan Film – &quot;Star Trek: The New Voyages&quot;
In an episode of the non-canon fan film series &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot;, a time-traveling Kirk and Spock attempt to warn Pike &quot;not&quot; to attempt to rescue the trapped cadets. Pike attempts it, in spite of what future-Kirk and future-Spock say, causing him to be injured by the delta rays and subsequently transition to a life in the wheelchair and its light communication device.

==Reception==
In 2012, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked the character Christoper Pike, as depicted in the original series and the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;, as the 23rd best character of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

In 2017, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ranked Pike as the sixth best captain of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, including the character&#x27;s presentations in the Kelvin films (Bruce Greenwood) and the &quot;Star Trek&quot; pilot and original series (Jeffrey Hunter and Sean Kenney).

In 2019, &quot;TV Guide&quot; called Captain Pike (played by Anson Mount) featured in &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; a &quot;fan favorite&quot;, also noting Pike&#x27;s Number One (played by Rebecca Romijn).

In 2019, due to his inclusion in &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&#x27;s&quot; second season, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked Anson Mount&#x27;s Pike as the second best captain in &quot;Star Trek&quot;:
This guy saw his future as a disfigured hunk of meat on a wheelchair, and yet he still pressed on. That&#x27;s what we call bravery.

Due to the popularity of Anson Mount and Ethan Peck&#x27;s portrayals in &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; of Pike and Spock, respectively, fans started a Change.org petition for CBS to commission a Pike spin-off, focusing on Pike and Spock&#x27;s adventures aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. As of November 2019, the petition had reached over 29,000 signatures.

<doc id="100278" wikidata="Q450946" url="?curid=100278" title="Krewe">
<text>A krewe ( ) is a social organization that stages parades and/or balls for the Carnival season. The term is best known for its association with Mardi Gras celebrations in New Orleans, but is also used in other Carnival celebrations throughout Louisiana (e.g. in Lafayette, Shreveport, and Baton Rouge) and along the Gulf of Mexico, such as the Gasparilla Pirate Festival in Tampa, Florida, Springtime Tallahassee, and Krewe of Amalee in DeLand, Florida with the Mardi Gras on Mainstreet Parade as well as in La Crosse, Wisconsin and at the Saint Paul Winter Carnival.

The word is thought to have been coined in the early 19th century by a New Orleans–based organization calling themselves Ye Mistick Krewe of Comus, as an archaic affectation; with time, it became the most common term for a New Orleans Carnival organization. The Mistick Krewe of Comus itself was inspired by the Cowbellion de Rakin Society that dated from 1830, a mystic society that organizes annual parades in Mobile, Alabama. 

The krewe system then spread from Mobile and New Orleans to other towns and cities with French Catholic heritage, including those with their own Mardi Gras traditions (such as the Courir de Mardi Gras). Following those of New Orleans, Louisiana&#x27;s next-oldest krewes are mostly based near Lafayette, which crowned its first Rex-style monarch, King Attakapas, in 1897. The state&#x27;s oldest extant children&#x27;s krewe, Oberon, is also based in Lafayette, and was founded in 1928.

Today, most Carnival krewes date their origins to the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

==Membership==
Krewe members are assessed fees in order to pay for the parade or ball. Fees can range from thousands of dollars a year per person for the most elaborate parades, to as little as $20 a year for smaller clubs. Criteria for krewe membership varies similarly, ranging from exclusive organizations largely limited to relatives of previous members to other organizations open to anyone able to pay the membership fee. Krewes with low membership fees may also require members to work to help build and decorate the parade floats and make their own costumes; higher priced krewes hire professionals to do this work. Parading krewe members are usually responsible for buying their own throws such as beads and coins, which are thrown to parade spectators according to tradition.
Some krewes also have other events, such as private dances or parties, for members throughout the year. Some also make a point of supporting charities and good causes. 

Some krewes restrict their membership to one sex, while others allow co-ed membership. For example, the Krewe of Endymion from New Orleans and Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla from Tampa are currently restricted to men only. Examples of female-only krewes include the New Orleans&#x27; Krewe of Cleopatra and Krewe of Muses and Tampa&#x27;s Krewe of Venus.

===Old line===
The first Krewes to parade during Mardi Gras are referred to as &quot;old line krewes&quot;. These include the Mistick Krewe, the Krewe of Proteus, Rex, Zulu, Twelfth Night Revelers, and the Knights of Momus.

===Super krewe===
While there is no official definition for &quot;super Krewe&quot;, it is generally accepted that a super krewe possesses over 1000 active dues paying members and maintains at least 500 riders for its parade each carnival.

<text>news.admin.net-abuse.email (sometimes abbreviated nanae or n.a.n-a.e, and often incorrectly spelled with a hyphen in &quot;email&quot;) is a Usenet newsgroup devoted to discussion of the abuse of email systems, specifically through email spam and similar attacks. According to a timeline compiled by Keith Lynch, news.admin.net-abuse.email was the first widely available electronic forum for discussing spam.

Steve Linford, the founder of The Spamhaus Project, sometimes posts in the newsgroup.

==Topics covered==
In its original charter the following examples of &quot;on-topic&quot; areas were listed:
*Chain letters
*DoS attacks
*Email address list
*Email bomb
*Email viruses
*Filtering software
*Large-scale mailings
*Listserv bombs
*Mailing list abuse
*Pyramid schemes
*Unsolicited email

Eventually, by mutual consent, it was also determined that the following were also &quot;on-topic&quot;:
*Cats (on a superficial/anecdotal level)

==History==
The group was officially proposed (i.e. its RFD posted) by Tim Skirvin (tskirvin) on July 9, 1996 alongside a number of other groups in order to reduce the load on the two net abuse groups at that time, news.admin.net-abuse.announce and news.admin.net-abuse.misc.

Later that month it went to vote and passed 451 to 28.

In September 2002 it was proposed that a subgroup, news.admin.net-abuse.email.blocklists, be created.

== NANAEisms ==
Over time, some (more or less) NANAE-specific terms were coined:

; 404-compliant: A website that has been terminated by its hosting provider for terms of service violation is said to be &quot;404-compliant&quot;, a reference to the 404 &quot;not found&quot; status code in HTTP and a parody of spammers claiming their spam is &quot;301 compliant&quot;, referring to a bill that never made it into a law.
; Auto-ignore: The automated response from an ISP&#x27;s abuse desk, when it is believed that sending out the automated response is the &quot;only&quot; action the ISP will take.
; Black hat: An ISP that enables spamming, for example a hosting provider that does not act upon spam complaints. Named after old westerns where the bad guys often wore black hats. Compare white hat and gray hat.
; Bulletproof : Said when it&#x27;s difficult to get an ISP to take action against spamming customers.
; Cartooney: A derisive portmanteau of the words cartoon and attorney, used to refer to a hollow lawsuit threat with which a spammer tries to intimidate an anti-spammer. This term may also refer to the spammer&#x27;s lawyer (who is usually assumed not to exist). The majority of such hollow legal threats arise in the context of a listed entity threatening a blacklist maintainer with legal action.
; Cats and Coffee warning: A Cats and Coffee warning or C&amp;C warning is a satirical warning that a usenet posting or other writing may contain humorous material. The C&amp;C warning originated with the usenet group news.admin.net-abuse.email, but has spread to other groups. The warning is an admonition to the reader to secure liquid beverages (particularly hot ones) and cats in case uncontrollable laughter breaks out upon reading the article.
; Chew toy: From time to time, a spammer surfaces in the group, typically ranting about how spam control activities, such as blacklisting, amount to censorship and violate that spammer&#x27;s right to free speech. These visiting spammers are referred to as chew toys (because of the slight entertainment value their tirades provide). The same chew toy may frequent the group for several years. There may not always be a chew toy active, and very seldom have there been more than one concurrently.
; Chickenboner: A derisive term used to refer to minor or amateur spammer. Named after a colorful and humorous description one newsgroup participant made of spammers living in trailers and eating at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
; Cut it out, Ron: A standard response to a posting that is suspected to be a troll. Named after a regular poster who often wrote humorous troll posts.
; Frea speach: Spammers claim the right to distribute unsolicited bulk mail as part of their right to free speech under the United States Constitution. After one such person repeatedly misspelled it as &quot;frea speach&quot;, newsgroup participants who argued that the right to free speech refers to the right to not be censored by the U.S. government and nothing to do with the right to employ the services of private individuals and organizations to distribute bulk mail, took to referring to this claimed right as &quot;frea speach&quot;, deliberately mis-spelling it partly as a parody and partly to distinguish it from actual free speech rights.
; Gray hat: An ISP whose stance in spam matters is somewhat ambiguous. It may terminate some spamming customers but not all of them. Compare black hat and white hat.
; Hat check: A request to determine the reputation of a given ISP in spam matters. See also black-, gray- and white hat.
; Joe job: The act of sending out spam made to look like it came from a person or organization which the spammer dislikes. Spamhaus, SpamCop and other anti-spam organizations are often the victims of these, as are some individual anti-spammers. Being Joe-jobbed is usually taken as a sign that the victim must have really hurt some spammer.
; LART : A meme which jokingly refers to a fictitious hypothetical blunt instrument (i.e. a &quot; Luser Attitude Readjustment Tool&quot;) whose primary and/or singular use and purpose is the metaphorically application or introduction of understanding (typically of Internet norms and conventions, but of any concept whatsoever) to a person currently lacking such understanding. Large mallets and anvils are popularly referred to as examples of items or tools which would be useful as LARTs.
; Listwashing : The act of responding to complaints by removing the complainer&#x27;s email address from the spammer&#x27;s list, without taking any further actions against the spammer.
; Lumber Cartel : A tongue-in-cheeck conspiracy theory that claimed anti-spammers were secretly paid agents of lumber companies.
; Mainsleaze: Spam coming from a notable or well-known (&quot;mainstream&quot;) company.
; Netscum: A list of anti-spam activists published by Sanford Wallace (also known as Spamford Wallace).
; Pink contract: A contract for internet services or hosting that makes it difficult to impossible to terminate the contract for spamming.
; Quirk Objection: &#x27;Objection! Assumes X not found in evidence!&#x27; A humorous objection, raised when the previous poster assumes the presence of something that has not yet been proven to exist. Not used to refer to things that have definitely been proven not to exist. Named after the regular poster &#x27;Captain Gym Z. Quirk&#x27; who first raised this. Often shortened to &quot;ObQuirk!&quot;
; Sock : A poster who is suspected to be someone else (usually a spammer) using a new name. Shortened from Sock Puppet.
; Spamhaus : Originally, this term was used as a derogatory epithet to refer to any individual ISP that had mostly or only spammers for customers. Nowadays, it more often refers to the anti-spam organization of the same name.

; Spamware : Software that was written explicitly for the purpose of spamming, or has features that are mostly or only useful to spammers and other abusers. Also called &#x27;ratware&#x27;.
; TINLC: There is no Lumber Cartel
; TINW: There is no We. The poster recognizes that NANAE does not have a collective opinion.
; Whack-a-Mole: The act of repeatedly causing spammers&#x27; throwaway accounts and drop boxes to be terminated. Named after the Whack-A-Mole arcade game.
; White hat: An ISP which takes spam complaints seriously and terminates offenders swiftly and with extreme prejudice. Named after old westerns where the good guys usually wore white hats. Compare black hat and gray hat.

<text>A lightsaber is a fictional energy sword featured throughout &quot;Star Wars&quot;. A typical lightsaber is shown as a luminous laser sword about in length emitted from a metal hilt around in length. First introduced in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, it has since appeared in all 12 theatrical &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, with at least one lightsaber duel occurring in each installment of the &quot;Skywalker saga&quot;. The lightsaber&#x27;s distinct appearance was created using rotoscoping for the original films, and with digital effects for the prequel and sequel trilogies.

In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, the lightsaber is the signature weapon of the light-side-wielding Jedi Order and the dark-side-wielding Sith Order. However, the lightsaber can also be wielded by non-Force-sensitive characters as an ordinary weapon or tool. The Jedi use different colored lightsabers. The most common lightsaber colors are blue and green, but other colors also exist, those being purple, white, black, and yellow. The Sith wield exclusively red-bladed sabers to distinguish themselves from the Jedi. The color of a lightsaber&#x27;s blade is given by kyber crystals. A kyber crystal has no color until it is approached by a Jedi. It then turns into a color determined by the wielder&#x27;s connection to the Force. A lightsaber&#x27;s hilt is built by its wielder and is, therefore, unique in design. There are several variations outside of the traditional single-bladed lightsaber, such as the double-bladed lightsaber (most famously wielded by Darth Maul), the curved-hilted lightsaber (wielded by Asajj Ventress and most famously by Count Dooku), crossguard lightsabers (used by Kylo Ren and occasionally by Jedi), and the Darksaber, forged by the Mandalorian Jedi Tarre Vizsla, but primarily wielded by the non-Force-sensitive Mandalorian rulers of Mandalore (including Pre Vizsla, Maul, Bo-Katan Kryze, Moff Gideon, and Din Djarin).

As presented in the early films, a lightsaber&#x27;s energy blade can cut, burn, and melt through most substances with little resistance. It leaves cauterized wounds in flesh, but can be deflected by another lightsaber blade, by energy shields, or by the metal beskar (found in Mandalorian armor) and phrik (the metal used to create electrostaffs). The blade has even been used as a tool to weld metal. Other times, the lightsaber has been shown to cause bleeding wounds in the flesh, sometimes accompanied by burns. Some exotic saber-proof melee weapons have been introduced in the Expanded Universe as well as later episodic films. Lightsabers can also deflect blaster bolts, allowing a wielder with Jedi reflexes to turn an enemy&#x27;s own gunfire against them. An active lightsaber gives off a distinctive hum, which rises in pitch and volume as the blade is moved rapidly through the air. Bringing the blade into contact with another lightsaber&#x27;s blade produces a loud crackle.

The lightsaber has become one of the most widely recognized elements of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. In 2008, a survey of approximately 2,000 film fans found it to be the most popular weapon in film history.

==Prop construction==

For the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, the film prop hilts were constructed by Roger Christian from old Graflex press camera flash battery packs and other pieces of hardware, while special effects that brought the blade to life on screen were made by John Stears. The full-sized sword props were designed to appear ignited onscreen, by later creating an &quot;in-camera&quot; glowing effect in post-production. 
The blade is a three-sided rod which was coated with a Scotchlite retroreflector array, the same sort used for highway signs. A lamp was positioned to the side of the taking camera and reflected towards the subject through 45-degree angled glass so that the sword would appear to glow from the camera&#x27;s point of view.

Set decorator Roger Christian found the handles for the Graflex Flash Gun in a photography shop in Great Marlborough Street, in London&#x27;s West End. He then added cabinet T-track to the handles, securely attaching them with cyanoacrylate glue. Adding a few &quot;greebles&quot; (surface details), Christian managed to hand-make the first prototype of a lightsaber prop for Luke Skywalker before production began. George Lucas decided he wanted to add a clip to the handle, so that Luke could hang it on his belt. Once Lucas felt the handle was up to his standards, it went to John Stears to create the wooden dowel rod with front-projection paint so that the animators would have a glow of light to enhance later on in post production. Due to lack of preparation time, Christian&#x27;s prototype and a second spare were used for the shooting in Tunisia, where filming on &quot;Star Wars&quot; began. It was discovered, however, that the glowing effect was greatly dependent on the rod&#x27;s orientation to the camera, and during the Obi-Wan Kenobi/Darth Vader duel, they could clearly be seen as rods. Because of this, the glow would be added in post-production through rotoscoping, which also allowed for diffusion to be employed to enhance the glow.

While original trilogy hilts were typically constructed using found parts, during the prequel and sequel trilogies a different process was sometimes used. Hilts were first machined out of metal materials. Then casts would be made using the metal hilts to create resin copies that were used on screen. The resin was often molded over a metal rod that a dueling blade could be attached to for fight sequences.

=== Visual effects ===
Korean animator Nelson Shin, who was working for DePatie–Freleng Enterprises at the time, was asked by his manager if he could animate the lightsaber in the live-action scenes of a film. After Shin accepted the assignment, the live-action footage was given to him. He drew the lightsabers with a rotoscope, an animation which was superimposed onto the footage of the physical lightsaber blade prop. Shin explained to the people from Lucasfilm that since a lightsaber is made of light, the sword should look &quot;a little shaky&quot; like a fluorescent tube. He suggested inserting one frame that was much lighter than the others while printing the film on an optical printer, making the light seem to vibrate. Shin also recommended adding a degausser sound on top of the other sounds for the weapon since the sound would be reminiscent of a magnetic field. The whole process took one week, surprising his company. Lucasfilm showed Shin the finished product, having followed his suggestions to use an X-Acto knife to give the lightsaber a very sharp look, and to have sound accompany the weapon&#x27;s movements.

===Sound===
The lightsaber sound effect was developed by sound designer Ben Burtt as a combination of the hum of idling interlock motors in aged movie projectors and interference caused by a television set on a shieldless microphone. Burtt discovered the latter accidentally as he was looking for a buzzing, sparking sound to add to the projector-motor hum.

The pitch changes of lightsaber movement were produced by playing the basic lightsaber tone on a loudspeaker and recording it on a moving microphone, generating Doppler shift to mimic a moving sound source.

==Depiction==
Lightsabers were present in the earliest drafts as mundane plasma weapons that were used alongside laser guns. The introduction of the Force in a later revision made the Jedi and the Sith supernaturally skilled; initially, they were only portrayed as swordsmen. The lightsaber became the Force-user&#x27;s tool, described in &quot;A New Hope&quot; by Obi-Wan Kenobi as &quot;not as clumsy or random as a blaster. An elegant weapon, from a more civilized age&quot;. The source of a lightsaber&#x27;s power is a kyber crystal. These crystals are also the power source of the Death Star&#x27;s superlaser.

In films such as &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; and &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;, melee weapons such as the electrostaff and plasma-lined blades deflect lightsabers.

===Types===
Lightsabers are depicted as hand-built as part of a Jedi&#x27;s or Sith&#x27;s training regimen. Each lightsaber is unique, though some may bear resemblance to others, especially if there is a connection between the builders. The hilt of most lightsabers are straight and predominantly cylindrical, though there are other lightsaber hilt types. The first film appearance of a dual-bladed lightsaber (first depicted in the comic series &quot;Tales of the Jedi&quot;) was in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, wielded by Darth Maul; it consists of two regular lightsabers joined at their butt ends each producing a blade independently. Count Dooku, beginning with the character&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, is shown to have a lightsaber with a curved hilt. The video game &quot;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed&quot; introduced two other variants: a lightsaber pike (a lightsaber with a shorter blade but a long handle, resembling a spear) and a Tonfa-style lightsaber with right-angle hilt. Additionally, in several spin-off series such as &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; and &quot;Rebels&quot;, special variants of the lightsaber have been depicted - such as the lightsaber-blaster wielded by Ezra Bridger. 

The &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe adds several lightsaber types, including short and dual-phase (adjustable length) weapons. In &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, Ezra Bridger&#x27;s original lightsaber is a hybrid that features a fully functional blaster pistol built into the handle. Kylo Ren, introduced in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, uses a lightsaber that features two crosshilt blades, giving it the appearance of a greatsword. His blade also has an unstable, fiery appearance, explained in canon reference books as stemming from a cracked kyber crystal. The Inquisitors of the Galactic Empire are depicted as wielding a unique variation of a double-bladed saber, mounted on a rotating ring enabling the blades 360 degrees of rotation and short-term flight capability. More obscure lightsaber variations, such as the &quot;lightwhip&quot;, an elongated flexible blade used in a matter akin to a whip, the &quot;lightclub&quot;, an enlarged standard lightsaber, and the &quot;shoto&quot;, a dramatically smaller variation often paired with a standard sized saber have also made appearances.

===Colors===
Lightsabers in the first two released films, &quot;A New Hope&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, had blades that were either blue (for the Jedi) or red (for the Sith). Luke Skywalker&#x27;s new lightsaber in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was colored blue during the initial editing of the film, and appears so in both an early movie trailer and the official theatrical posters; it was later changed to green in the film&#x27;s final edit after initial viewings and screen tests by the filmmakers, who felt that it would better stand out against the blue sky of Tatooine in outdoor scenes, and this color change is also reflected in the film&#x27;s re-release posters. Mace Windu&#x27;s purple-bladed lightsaber, as first seen in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, was requested by the actor Samuel L. Jackson, who believed the color, which is his personal favorite, would make his character be easily recognized among other Jedi. Jackson is known to frequently request that the characters he plays use an item that is purple in color. &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; showed the guardians of the Jedi Temple wielding yellow-bladed lightsabers, and, at the end of &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, Rey is shown to have built a yellow-bladed lightsaber using part of her staff as the hilt.

As depicted in &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; and &quot;Rebels&quot;, the builder of a lightsaber finds a kyber crystal and meditates with it until the crystal acquires a color. The color of this crystal becomes the blade&#x27;s color when installed into a lightsaber hilt. In the book &quot;Star Wars: Ahsoka&quot; and the comic series &quot;Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith&quot;, it is shown that dark side users remove the crystal from a defeated Jedi&#x27;s lightsaber and concentrate Force energy on it to break its connection to the light side, a process known as &quot;bleeding&quot; to create a red crystal. The process can also be reversed, as shown in &quot;Ahsoka&quot;, when the titular character does so to a pair of crystals taken from an Inquisitor. She uses them in the pair of white-bladed lightsabers she builds at the end of the novel.

Other colors have appeared in various expanded media projects, including many video games where the player can select their character&#x27;s lightsaber color.

==== Darksaber ====
The Darksaber is a unique lightsaber that has a distinct black blade with a white halo, introduced in &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; (2008) and subsequently appearing in &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, where it is described as an ancient lightsaber created by Tarre Vizla, the first Mandalorian to become a Jedi, and later serves as a symbol of Mandalorian authority in the hands of Bo-Katan Kryze. It subsequently appears briefly in the hands of Moff Gideon in the season one finale of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, to whom Kryze had previously surrendered the weapon. By the end of the second season&#x27;s finale, it belongs to series protagonist Din Djarin, who has bested Gideon for it. In the second episode of the third season of the show, the weapon (nominally) returns to Kryze&#x27;s ownership, after she defeats a cyborg creature that captures Djarin (it remains in Din Djarin&#x27;s possession, however), and she officially reclaims the blade in the season&#x27;s sixth episode. It is destroyed by Gideon in the third season finale.

===Choreography===
The technical lightsaber choreography for the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy was developed by Hollywood sword-master Bob Anderson. Anderson personally trained Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) and, in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, performed all the stunts as Darth Vader during the lightsaber duels wearing Vader&#x27;s costume. Anderson&#x27;s role in the trilogy was highlighted in the film &quot;Reclaiming the Blade&quot; where he shared his experiences as a fencer developing the lightsaber techniques for the three original movies.

The lightsaber duels in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy were specifically choreographed by stunt-coordinator Nick Gillard to be miniature &quot;stories&quot;. For these films, Gillard was the primary sword instructor for Liam Neeson (Qui-Gon Jinn), Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi), Ray Park (Darth Maul) and Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader) among other actors. His goal in choreographing the action for &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; was to create stunts that flow from the story; &quot;You can&#x27;t just think, &#x27;I&#x27;m a stunt coordinator, I&#x27;m going to make a big stunt happen&#x27;,&quot; Gillard said. &quot;It&#x27;s all about making it tie in nicely with the film so that you don&#x27;t notice the stunts.&quot;

In writing the prequel trilogy, George Lucas said he wanted the lightsaber combat to be &quot;reminiscent of what had been done in the previous films but also something that was more energized. We&#x27;d seen old men, young boys, and characters who were half-droid, but we&#x27;d never seen a Jedi in his prime. I wanted to do that with a fight that was faster and more dynamic—and we were able to pull that off.&quot;

According to Gillard, various lightsaber combat styles were devised for the prequels and intended to further characterize their practitioners.

For &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, Gillard set out certain styles and faults for the saber-wielding characters. He added that the Jedi&#x27;s use of such &quot;a short-range weapon&quot; meant &quot;they would have to be very good at it&quot;; combining a variety of disciplines from various sword fighting styles to martial arts &quot;with a touch of tennis and tree chopping&quot;, he created the style seen in the &quot;Episode I&quot; lightsaber battles.

For &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, director J. J. Abrams decided to approach the choreography similarly to how it was done in the original trilogy. Abrams stated that the prequel trilogy choreography was &quot;increasingly spectacular and stylized, almost like dance choreography&quot;, but that was not what they really wanted to go for in the new films. He told &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, &quot;When you look at &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot;, they are very different lightsaber battles, but for me they felt more powerful because they were not quite as slick. I was hoping to go for something much more primitive, aggressive and rougher, a throwback to the kind of heart-stopping lightsaber fights I remembered being so enthralled by as a kid.&quot;

== Cultural impact ==

=== Merchandise ===
Over the years, advancements in technology have allowed for the creation of increasingly immersive and realistic lightsaber replicas. One notable development in this regard is the introduction of neopixel lightsabers, which have revolutionized the lightsaber replica market by utilizing a strip of individually addressable RGB LEDs encased within a durable polycarbonate blade. This design allows for a higher level of control over the lightsaber&#x27;s appearance and behavior.

==== Disney Parks ====
Disneyland in California sells lightsaber-themed churros outside its &quot;Star Tours&quot; attraction.

Disneyland and Disney World (Hollywood Studios) also sell legacy lightsabers which are replicas of the lightsabers seen used by the Jedi, Sith, and other warriors in the movies and television shows such as Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Rey Skywalker, Count Dooku, and Kylo Ren.

Disneyland and Hollywood Studios also offer Savi&#x27;s Workshop, a place where guests can build their own lightsaber and choose their own kyber crystal, thereby changing the blade color of their own unique lightsaber.

Besides Savi&#x27;s Workshop, there is another custom lightsaber experience. The Star Trader at Disneyland offers guests a chance to build their own lightsabers, without first paying 200 dollars for the experience.

=== Attractions ===
The &quot;Jedi Training: Trials of the Temple&quot; is a live show where children are selected to learn the teachings of the Jedi Knights, the Force, and the basics of Lightsaber combat to become Padawan learners. The show is present at the Rebels stage next to Star Tours – The Adventures Continue attraction at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios and at the Tomorrowland Terrace at Disneyland.
Additionally, Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser has incorporated lightsaber training for each guest aboard the spacecraft during their stay. The training is led by the Saja cast members and teaches the fourth form of lightsaber combat, Ataru, to the guests. Both lightsabers and shields are used during training since the guests learn to use Ataru to deflect incoming projectiles. There is no lightsaber-to-lightsaber combat in this attraction and guests must be at least seven years old to participate.

=== Similar weapons ===
The virtual reality rhythm game &quot;Beat Saber&quot; involves the player using two lightsabers in order to slash a series of oncoming cubes.

In Kamen Rider Black RX, the main character, Rider RX also known as Kotaro Minami, uses his lightsaber-ish weapon &quot;Revolcane&quot; to fight the Crisis Empire, a terrorist organization.

In Saban&#x27;s Masked Rider, the main character, known as Dex Stewart, uses his lightsaber-ish weapon &quot;Electro Saber&quot; to fight Masked Rider&#x27;s foes.
==== Parodies ====
In the 1987 film &quot;Spaceballs&quot; by Mel Brooks, &quot;the Schwartz&quot; is a play on &quot;the Force&quot;, from &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The lightsabers emanate from the Schwartz-rings, rather than a hilt. The cartoon series &quot;Futurama&quot; features many lightsaber-style weapons, notably expanding batons used by police. The batons glow and &quot;whoosh&quot; with a lightsaber&#x27;s distinctive hum, but are used to beat people. In Jim Butcher&#x27;s &quot;Dresden Files&quot; novel series, medical examiner and &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan Waldo Butters wields one of the three holy Swords of the Cross, which re-fashions itself into a lightsaber upon accepting him as its owner. In Yuya Sato&#x27;s &quot;&quot; light novel trilogy, main antagonist Orvin Elevator / Kazuya Togami wields a lightsaber built into their prosthetic arm, to which they are berated for copyright infringement by Genocider Syo / Genocide Jack; in the anime &quot;Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope&#x27;s Peak High School&quot;, this same lightsaber is instead depicted as a flaming mechanical &quot;katana&quot; wielded by Kyosuke Munakata.

=== Games ===
With the advent of motion-controlled video games, players were given the opportunity to wield an in-game lightsaber with their own hands. In the seventh generation of video game consoles, there were several &quot;Star Wars&quot; video games available on the Wii (&quot;Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars – Lightsaber Duels&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars – Republic Heroes&quot; and &quot;Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars&quot;) and one on the Xbox 360 (&quot;Kinect Star Wars&quot;) that utilized motion controls to wield a lightsaber through arm gestures. &quot;Unleashed&quot; and &quot;Duels&quot;, both developed by Krome Studios, have more precise control of the lightsaber, allowing players to swing it in any of five different directions (up, down, left, right or forward) with the Wii Remote, while &quot;Kinect&quot; takes advantage of the eponymous, camera-based motion controller to grant the player a more fluid, one-to-one control method of swinging the lightsaber.

Prior to the seventh generation, there were also a few earlier &quot;Star Wars&quot; games that used gesture-based control to simulate lightsaber combat, such as the two bonus levels of the arcade game &quot;Star Wars Trilogy&quot;, where the player controls Luke Skywalker as he wields his lightsaber against Boba Fett and Darth Vader in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; by pushing a joystick in one of eight directions to follow on-screen offensive and defensive cues, and a TV game released around the time &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; came to theaters, titled &quot;Star Wars: Saga Edition – Lightsaber Battle Game&quot;, in which the player swings a lightsaber-shaped controller to deflect blaster bolts from infantry (such as battle droids and clone troopers) and duel against characters from across the saga.

By the time Disney purchased Lucasfilm, new technological advances made augmented reality possible, leading to the creation of some more notable motion-controlled lightsaber video games that took advantage of that feature. One of them came in the form of a special activity mode in the official &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan app on iOS and Android in which players use their smartphone&#x27;s motion sensors to practice and master blaster deflection with a training droid (which appears on the phone&#x27;s rear camera), similar to the deflection training exercises featured aboard the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; in &quot;A New Hope&quot;, while progressing through the ranks of the Jedi or Sith order. Another is in &quot;Star Wars: Jedi Challenges&quot;, which works with a Lenovo Mirage AR headset, a tracking sensor and a dedicated lightsaber controller that launched in December 2017. One of the multiple game modes available in &quot;Challenges&quot;, which was jointly developed by Disney and Lenovo, enables players to confront &quot;Star Wars&quot; villains in lightsaber duels, such as Darth Maul and Kylo Ren.

<text>Dou Xian (; - died 92 AD) was a Chinese general and consort kin of the Eastern Han dynasty, famous for destroying the Xiongnu nomadic empire.

==Early life==
A native of modern-day Xianyang, Shaanxi Province, he was part of the powerful Dou clan which dominated court politics during his tenure. However, his father Dou Xun fell into disgrace and died in 70 AD, leaving Dou Xian an orphan. His fortunes were greatly enhanced, though, when his two sisters entered the imperial harem in 77. In the following year, the older of these two sisters became Empress Zhangde, the wife of Emperor Zhang of Han, and lasted briefly as empress dowager and regent during the early reign of Emperor He of Han. The biography of Dou Xian can be found in Chapter LIII of the Hou Hanshu.

==Campaigns against the Xiongnu==

In 89 AD, Dou Xian led a Han expedition against the Northern Xiongnu. The army advanced from Jilu, Manyi, and Guyang in three great columns. In the summer of 89, the forces—comprising a total of 40,000 troops—assembled at Zhuoye Mountain. Near the end of the campaign, Dou&#x27;s forces chased the Northern Chanyu into the Altai Mountains, killing 13,000 Xiongnu and accepting the surrender of 200,000 Xiongnu from 81 tribes. A light cavalry of 2,000 was sent towards the Xiongnu at Hami, capturing the region from them. Dou Xian marched with his troops in a triumphal progress to the heartland of the Northern Xiongnu&#x27;s territory and engraved an inscription commemorating the victory on Mount Yanran, before returning to Han. The Han victory in the campaign of 89 AD resulted in the destruction of the Xiongnu state.

In 90 AD, Dou Xian had encamped at Wuwei. He sent Deputy Colonel Yan Pan with 2,000 light cavalry to strike down the final Xiongnu defenses in the Western Regions, capturing Yiwu and receiving the surrender of Jushi. Major Liang Feng was dispatched to capture the Northern Chanyu, which he did, but he was forced to leave him behind as Dou Xian had already broken camp and returned to China. In the tenth month of 90 AD, Dou Xian sent Liang Feng and Ban Gu to help the Northern Chanyu make preparations for his planned travel as he wished to submit to the Han court in person the following month.

However, this never came to be as Dou Xian dispatched General Geng Kui and Shizi of the Southern Xiongnu with 8,000 light cavalry to attack the Northern Chanyu, encamped at Heyun (河雲), in 90 AD. Once the Han forces arrived at Zhuoye Mountains, they left their heavy equipment behind to launch a swift pincer movement towards Heyun. Geng Kui attacked from the east via the Khangai Mountains and Ganwei River (甘微河), while Shizi attacked from the west via the Western Lake (西海). The Northern Chanyu—said to be greatly shocked by this—launched a counterattack, but he was forced to flee as he left his family and seal behind. The Han killed 8,000 men and captured several thousands. In 91 AD, General Geng Kui and Major Ren Shang with a light cavalry of 800 advanced further via the Juyan Gol (Juyansai) into the Altai Mountains, where the Northern Chanyu had encamped. At the Battle of the Altai Mountains, they massacred 5,000 Xiongnu men and pursued the Northern Chanyu until he escaped to an unknown place. By 91 AD, the last remnants of the Northern Xiongnu had migrated west towards the Ili River valley.

==Downfall==
In 92, the Dous suddenly fell from grace as the result of a coup d&#x27;état. The details are unclear now, but it appeared that Emperor He, perhaps encouraged by his brother Prince Qing (whose mother had died at the Dous&#x27; hand and whose status as crown prince had been stripped away by their machinations) and the eunuch Zheng Zhong (鄭眾), made sudden orders to the imperial guards to have them arrest Dou Xian&#x27;s associates and execute them. He sent Dou Xian and his brothers back to their marches, but eventually ordered them to commit suicide, with the exception of Dou Gui. Empress Dowager Dou remained empress dowager, but lost all power.

==Inscription of Yanran==

The Inscription of Yanran, composed by Ban Gu and engraved on Mount Yanran to commemorate Dou Xian&#x27;s victory against the Xiongnu, was recorded in the 5th-century &quot;Book of Later Han&quot;. The expression &quot;to carve a stone on Yanran&quot; () entered the Chinese language as a synonym for achieving a decisive victory. In 2016, a researchers team of Mongolian national university expedition rediscovered the inscription in the Inil (Delgerkhangai) Mountains in southern Mongolia&quot;. The 220 legible characters of the inscription, out of a total of 260, are identical to the text recorded in the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;.

<text>Bonnie Lynn Raitt (; born November 8, 1949) is an American singer, guitarist, and songwriter. In 1971, Raitt released her self-titled debut album. Following this, she released a series of critically acclaimed roots-influenced albums that incorporated elements of blues, rock, folk, and country. She was also a frequent session player and collaborator with other artists, including Warren Zevon, Little Feat, Jackson Browne, the Pointer Sisters, John Prine, and Leon Russell.

In 1989, after several years of limited commercial success, she had a major hit with her tenth studio album, &quot;Nick of Time&quot;, which included the song &quot;Nick of Time&quot;. The album reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. It has since been selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry. Her following two albums, &quot;Luck of the Draw&quot; (1991) and &quot;Longing in Their Hearts&quot; (1994), were multimillion sellers, generating several hit singles, including &quot;Something to Talk About&quot;, &quot;Love Sneakin&#x27; Up On You&quot;, and the ballad &quot;I Can&#x27;t Make You Love Me&quot; (with Bruce Hornsby on piano). Her 2022 single &quot;Just Like That&quot; won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year.

As of 2023, Raitt has received 13 competitive Grammy Awards, from 30 nominations, as well as a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. She ranked No. 50 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot; and ranked No. 89 on the magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.&quot; Australian country music artist Graeme Connors has said &quot;Bonnie Raitt does something with a lyric no one else can do; she bends it and twists it right into your heart.&quot;

In 2000, Raitt was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She has received the Icon Award from the Billboard Women in Music Awards and the MusiCares Person of the Year Award from The Recording Academy. In 2024, she was a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honor.

==Early life==
Bonnie Lynn Raitt was born on November 8, 1949, in Burbank, California. Her mother, Marge Goddard (née Haydock), was a pianist, and her father, John Raitt, was a professional actor and singer in musical productions such as &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;. Raitt is of Scottish ancestry; her ancestors constructed Rait Castle near Nairn. As a child, Raitt would often play with her two brothers, Steve and David and was a self-described tomboy. John Raitt&#x27;s job as a theater actor meant Bonnie did not interact with him as much as she would have liked. Raitt grew to resent her mother, as she became the main authority figure of the household whenever John was away.

Raitt&#x27;s musically inclined parents had a strong influence on her life. From a young age, she and her brothers were encouraged to pursue music. Initially, Raitt played the piano but was intimidated by her mother&#x27;s abilities. She instead began playing a Stella guitar, which she received as a Christmas gift in 1957 at the age of eight. Raitt did not take lessons; she was instead influenced by the American folk music revival of the 1950s. She was also influenced by the beatnik movement, stating &quot;It represented my whole belief [...] I&#x27;d grow my hair real long so I looked like a beatnik.&quot;

From ages eight through fifteen, Raitt and her brothers attended a summer camp in the Adirondack Mountains called Camp Regis. It was there where Raitt learned of her musical talents, when camp counselors would ask her to play in front of the campers. Learning how to play songs from folk albums then became a hobby for Raitt. As a teenager, Raitt was self-conscious about her weight and her freckles, and saw music as an escape from reality. &quot;That was my saving grace. I just sat in my room and played my guitar,&quot; said Raitt.

After graduating from Oakwood Friends School in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1967, Raitt entered Radcliffe College of Harvard University, majoring in Social Relations and African studies. She said her &quot;plan was to travel to Tanzania, where President Julius Nyerere was creating a government based on democracy and socialism&quot;. She was the lead singer in a campus music group called the &quot;Revolutionary Music Collective&quot; founded by songwriter Bob Telson which played for striking Harvard students during the Student strike of 1970. Raitt befriended blues promoter Dick Waterman. During her second year of college, Raitt left school for a semester and moved to Philadelphia with Waterman and other local musicians. Raitt said it was an &quot;opportunity that changed everything.&quot;

==Career==
===1970–1976===
In the summer of 1970, she played with her brother David on stand-up bass with Mississippi Fred McDowell at the Philadelphia Folk Festival as well as opening for John Hammond at the Gaslight Cafe in New York. She was seen by a reporter from &quot;Newsweek&quot;, who began to spread the word about her performance. Scouts from major record companies were soon attending her shows to watch her play. She eventually accepted an offer from Warner Bros., who soon released her debut album, &quot;Bonnie Raitt&quot;, in 1971. The album was warmly received by the music press, with many writers praising her skills as an interpreter and as a bottleneck guitarist; at the time, few women in popular music had strong reputations as guitarists.

While admired by those who saw her perform, and respected by her peers, Raitt gained little public acclaim for her work. Her critical stature continued to grow but record sales remained modest. Her second album, &quot;Give It Up&quot;, was released in 1972 to positive reviews. One journalist described the album as &quot;an excellent set&quot; and &quot;established the artist as an inventive and sympathetic interpreter&quot;. However, it did not change her commercial fortunes. 1973&#x27;s &quot;Takin&#x27; My Time&quot; was also met with critical acclaim, but these notices were not matched by the sales.

Raitt began to receive greater press coverage, including a 1975 cover story for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, but with 1974&#x27;s &quot;Streetlights&quot;, reviews for her work were becoming increasingly mixed. By this point, Raitt was already experimenting with different producers and different styles, and she began to adopt a more mainstream sound that continued through 1975&#x27;s &quot;Home Plate&quot;. In 1976, Raitt made an appearance on Warren Zevon&#x27;s eponymous album.

She was influenced by the playing style of Lowell George, of the band Little Feat, particularly his use of an MXR Dyna Comp pre-amp compressor with a slide guitar. B.B. King once called Raitt the &quot;best damn slide player working today&quot;.

===1977–1988===

1977&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Forgiveness&quot; album gave Raitt her first commercial breakthrough, when it yielded a hit single in her remake of &quot;Runaway&quot;. Recast as a heavy rhythm and blues recording based on a rhythmic groove inspired by Al Green, Raitt&#x27;s version of &quot;Runaway&quot; was disparaged by many critics. However, the song&#x27;s commercial success prompted a bidding war for Raitt between Warner Bros. and Columbia Records. &quot;There was this big Columbia–Warner war going on at the time&quot;, recalled Raitt in a 1990 interview. &quot;James Taylor had just left Warner Bros. and made a big album for Columbia... And then, Warner signed Paul Simon away from Columbia, and they didn&#x27;t want me to have a hit record for Columbia – no matter what! So, I renegotiated my contract, and they basically matched Columbia&#x27;s offer. Frankly the deal was a really big deal.&quot;

Warner Brothers held higher expectations for Raitt&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Glow&quot;, in 1979, but it was released to poor reviews as well as modest sales. Raitt had one commercial success in 1979 when she helped organize the five concerts of Musicians United for Safe Energy (MUSE) at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Those shows spawned the three-record gold album &quot;No Nukes&quot;, as well as a Warner Brothers feature film &quot;No Nukes&quot;, and featured co-founders Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, John Hall, and Raitt as well as Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Doobie Brothers, Carly Simon, James Taylor, Gil Scott-Heron, and others.

In 1980, she appeared as herself in the Paramount film &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; where she sang &quot;Don&#x27;t It Make You Wanna Dance&quot;.

For her next record, 1982&#x27;s &quot;Green Light&quot;, Raitt made a conscious attempt to revisit the sound of her earlier records. However, to her surprise, many of her peers and the media compared her new sound to the burgeoning new wave movement. The album received her strongest reviews in years, but her sales did not improve and this had a severe impact on her relationship with Warner Brothers.

====&quot;Tongue and Groove&quot; and release from Warner Brothers====
In 1983, Raitt was finishing work on her follow-up album, &quot;Tongue and Groove&quot;. The day after mastering was completed on &quot;Tongue &amp; Groove&quot;, the record company dropped Raitt from its roster, not being happy with her commercial performance up to that point. The album was shelved and not released, and Raitt was left without a record contract. At this time Raitt was also struggling with alcohol and drug abuse problems.

Despite her personal and professional problems, Raitt continued to tour and participate in political activism. In 1985, she sang and appeared in the video of &quot;Sun City&quot;, the anti-apartheid song written and produced by guitarist Steven Van Zandt. Along with her participation in Farm Aid and Amnesty International concerts, Raitt traveled to Moscow, Russia in 1987 to participate in the first joint Soviet/American Peace Concert, later shown on the Showtime cable network. Also in 1987, Raitt organized a benefit in Los Angeles for Countdown &#x27;87 to Stop Contra Aid. The benefit featured herself, along with Don Henley, Herbie Hancock, and others.

Two years after Warner Brothers Records dropped Raitt from their label, they notified her of their plans to release the &quot;Tongue and Groove&quot; album. &quot;I said it wasn&#x27;t really fair,&quot; recalled Raitt. &quot;I think at this point they felt kind of bad. I mean, I was out there touring on my savings to keep my name up, and my ability to draw was less and less. So they agreed to let me go in and recut half of it, and that&#x27;s when it came out as &quot;Nine Lives&quot;.&quot; That album, released in 1986 to critical and commercial disappointment, was Raitt&#x27;s last new recording for Warner Brothers.

In late 1987, Raitt joined singers k.d. lang and Jennifer Warnes as background vocalists for Roy Orbison&#x27;s television special, &quot;Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night&quot;. Following this highly acclaimed broadcast, Raitt began working on new material. By then, she was clean and sober, having resolved her problems with substance abuse. She later credited Stevie Ray Vaughan for his help in a Minnesota State Fair concert the night after Vaughan&#x27;s 1990 death. During this time, Raitt considered signing with the Prince-owned Paisley Park Records, but they could not come to an agreement and negotiations fell through. Instead, she began recording a bluesy mix of pop and rock songs under the production guidance of Don Was at Capitol Records.

Raitt had met Was through Hal Willner, who was putting together &quot;Stay Awake&quot;, a tribute album to Disney music for A&amp;M. Was and Willner both wanted Raitt to sing lead on an adult-contemporary arrangement created by Was for &quot;Baby Mine&quot;, the lullaby from &quot;Dumbo&quot;. Raitt was very pleased with the sessions, and she asked Was to produce her next album.

===1989–1999: Commercial breakthrough===

After working with Was on the &quot;Stay Awake&quot; album, Raitt&#x27;s management, Gold Mountain, approached numerous labels about a new record deal and found interest from Capitol Records. Raitt was signed to Capitol by A&amp;R executive Tim Devine. With her first Capitol Records release, and after nearly twenty years in the business, Raitt achieved commercial success with &quot;Nick of Time&quot;, her tenth overall album of her career. Released in the spring of 1989, &quot;Nick of Time&quot; went to number one on the U.S. album chart following Raitt&#x27;s Grammy sweep in early 1990. This album has also been voted number 230 in the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Raitt later stated that her 10th try was &quot;my first sober album.&quot;

At the same time, Raitt received a fourth Grammy Award for her duet &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood&quot; with John Lee Hooker on his album &quot;The Healer&quot;. &quot;Nick of Time&quot; was also the first of many of her recordings to feature her longtime rhythm section of Ricky Fataar and James &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchinson (although previously Fataar had played on her &quot;Green Light&quot; album and Hutchinson had worked on &quot;Nine Lives&quot;), both of whom continue to record and tour with her. Since its release in 1989, &quot;Nick of Time&quot; has currently sold over five million copies in the US alone.

Raitt followed up this success with three more Grammy Awards for her next album, 1991&#x27;s &quot;Luck of the Draw&quot;, which sold seven million copies in the United States. Three years later, in 1994, she added two more Grammys with her album &quot;Longing in Their Hearts&quot;, her second number one album, that sold two million copies in the US. Raitt&#x27;s collaboration with Don Was amicably came to an end with 1995&#x27;s live release &quot;Road Tested&quot;. Released to solid reviews, it was certified gold in the US.

&quot;Rock Steady&quot; was a hit written by Bryan Adams and Gretchen Peters in 1995. The song was written as a duet with Bryan Adams and Bonnie Raitt for her Road Tested tour, which also became one of her albums. The original demo version of the song appears on Adams&#x27; 1996 single &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Night to Remember&quot;.

For her next studio album, Raitt hired Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake as her producers. &quot;I loved working with Don Was but I wanted to give myself and my fans a stretch and do something different,&quot; Raitt stated. Her work with Froom and Blake was released on &quot;Fundamental&quot; in 1998.

===2000–2007===

In March 2000, Raitt was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. &quot;Silver Lining&quot; was released in 2002. In the US, it reached number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and was later certified Gold. It contains the singles &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help You Now&quot;, &quot;Time of Our Lives&quot;, and the title track (a cover version of David Gray&#x27;s original song). All three singles charted within the top 40 of the US Adult Contemporary chart.

On March 19, 2002, Bonnie Raitt received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to the recording industry, located at 1750 N. Vine Street. In 2003 Capitol Records released the compilation album &quot;The Best of Bonnie Raitt&quot;. It contains songs from her prior Capitol albums from 1989 to 2002 including &quot;Nick of Time&quot;, &quot;Luck of the Draw&quot;, &quot;Longing in Their Hearts&quot;, &quot;Road Tested&quot;, &quot;Fundamental&quot;, and &quot;Silver Lining&quot;. Raitt was featured on the album &quot;True Love&quot; by Toots and the Maytals, which won the Grammy Award in 2004 for Best Reggae Album.

&quot;Souls Alike&quot; was released in September 2005. In the US, it reached the top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. It contains the singles &quot;I Will Not Be Broken&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want Anything to Change&quot;, which both charted in the top 40 of the US Adult Contemporary chart. In 2006, she released the live DVD/CD &quot;Bonnie Raitt and Friends&quot;, which was filmed as part of the critically acclaimed VH1 Classic &quot;Decades Rock Live!&quot; concert series, featuring special guests Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27;, Alison Krauss, Ben Harper, Jon Cleary, and Norah Jones. The DVD was released by Capitol Records on August 15. &quot;Bonnie Raitt and Friends&quot;, which was recorded live in Atlantic City, NJ on September 30, 2005, features never-before-seen performance and interview footage, including four duets not included in the VH1 Classic broadcast of the concert. The accompanying CD features 11 tracks, including the radio single &quot;Two Lights in the Nighttime&quot; (featuring Ben Harper). In 2007, Raitt contributed to &quot;Goin&#x27; Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino&quot;. With Jon Cleary, she sang a medley of &quot;I&#x27;m in Love Again&quot; and &quot;All by Myself&quot; by Fats Domino.

Raitt is interviewed on screen and appears in performance footage in the 2005 documentary film &quot;Make It Funky!&quot;, which presents a history of New Orleans music and its influence on rhythm and blues, rock and roll, funk and jazz. In the film, Raitt performs &quot;What is Success&quot; with Allen Toussaint and band, a song he wrote and that Raitt included on her 1974 album &quot;Streetlights&quot;.

===2008–present===
Raitt appeared on the June 7, 2008 broadcast of Garrison Keillor&#x27;s radio program &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;. She performed two blues songs with Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27;: &quot;No Getting Over You&quot; and &quot;There Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; in Ramblin&#x27;&quot;. Raitt also sang &quot;Dimming of the Day&quot; with Richard Thompson. This show, along with another one with Raitt and her band in October 2006, is archived on the &quot;Prairie Home Companion&quot; website. Raitt appeared in the 2011 documentary &quot;Reggae Got Soul: The Story of Toots and the Maytals&quot;, which was featured on the BBC and described as &quot;The untold story of one of the most influential artists ever to come out of Jamaica&quot;.

In February 2012, Raitt performed a duet with Alicia Keys at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012 honoring Etta James. In April 2012, Raitt released her first studio album since 2005, entitled &quot;Slipstream&quot;. It charted at Number 6 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart marking her first top ten album since 1994&#x27;s &quot;Longing in Their Hearts&quot;. The album was described as &quot;one of the best of her 40-year career&quot; by &quot;American Songwriter&quot; magazine. In September 2012, Raitt was featured in a campaign called &quot;30 Songs / 30 Days&quot; to support &quot;Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide&quot;, a multi-platform media project inspired by a project outlined in a book by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn. In 2013, she appeared on Foy Vance&#x27;s album &quot;Joy of Nothing.&quot;

On May 30, 2015, Leon Russell, Bonnie Raitt and Ivan Neville gave a performance at The Canyon Club in Agoura Hills, California to raise cash for Marty Grebb who was battling cancer. Grebb had played on some of their albums.

In February 2016, Raitt released her seventeenth studio album &quot;Dig In Deep&quot;. The album charted at number 11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and received favorable reviews. The album features the single &quot;Gypsy in Me&quot; as well as a cover of the INXS song &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;.
Raitt cancelled the first leg of her 2018 spring-summer touring schedule due to a recently discovered medical issue requiring surgical intervention. She reported that a &quot;full recovery&quot; is expected and that she planned to resume touring with already-scheduled dates in June 2018.

In 2022, Raitt announced the title of her 21st studio album would be &quot;Just Like That...&quot;. The record was released on April 22, 2022, and coincided with the beginning of a nationwide tour that ran through November 2022. Preceding the album, Raitt released &quot;Made Up Mind&quot;, a song originally written by Canadian roots duo The Bros. Landreth, as the lead single. The title track of the album won for Song of the Year at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2023. The song also won in the Best American Roots Song category.

== Artistry ==
Raitt possesses a contralto vocal range. Music journalist Robert Christgau described Raitt&#x27;s voice as not particularly beautiful but &quot;textured&quot;, capable of shouting, crooning, &quot;carry[ing] a tune or fill[ing] a room&quot;. Christgau likened her vocal style to &quot;a loving woman who has the touch, soft and hard at the right times in the right places&quot;. Journalist Will Hermes described Raitt&#x27;s voice as warm and precise. Describing her as a &quot;master interpreter of other writers’ songs&quot;, Chris Hansen Orf of &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; note that Raitt is equally skilled at singing blues, folk, country, rock and pop music. Kevin McKeough of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; observed that blues has &quot;remained the bedrock of all of Raitt&#x27;s musical excursions&quot;, with her voice alternating between &quot;sigh to a call to a sustained cry&quot;. Discussing the ability of a singer to make use of her voice, singer Linda Ronstadt stated &quot;Of my own peers, Bonnie Raitt has way more musicianship than I do.&quot; Singer and guitarist David Crosby has said that Raitt is his favorite singer of all time.

==Personal life==
Raitt has taken sabbaticals, including after the deaths of her parents, brother, and best friend. She has said &quot;When I went through a lot of loss, I took a hiatus.&quot; Raitt and actor Michael O&#x27;Keefe were married on April 27, 1991. They announced their divorce on November 9, 1999, with a factor appearing to be that their careers caused considerable time apart.

===Drug and alcohol use and recovery===
Raitt was a user of alcohol and drugs, but began psychotherapy and joined Alcoholics Anonymous in the late 1980s. &quot;I thought I had to live that partying lifestyle in order to be authentic,&quot; she said, &quot;but in fact if you keep it up too long, all you&#x27;re going to be is sloppy or dead.&quot; She has been sober since 1987. She has credited Stevie Ray Vaughan for breaking her substance abuse, saying that what gave her the courage to admit her alcohol problem and stop drinking was seeing that Vaughan was an even better musician when sober. She has also said that she stopped because she realized that the &quot;late night life&quot; was not working for her. In 1989, she said, &quot;I really feel like some angels have been carrying me around. I just have more focus and more discipline, and consequently more self-respect.&quot;

==Political activism==
Raitt&#x27;s political involvement goes back to the early 1970s. Her 1972 album &quot;Give It Up&quot; had a dedication &quot;to the people of North Vietnam ...&quot; printed on the back. Raitt&#x27;s web site urges fans to learn more about preserving the environment. She was a founding member of Musicians United for Safe Energy in 1979 and a catalyst for the larger anti-nuclear movement, becoming involved with groups like the Abalone Alliance and Alliance for Survival. In 1994 at the urging of Dick Waterman, Raitt funded the replacement of a headstone for one of her mentors, blues guitarist Fred McDowell through the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund. Raitt later financed memorial headstones in Mississippi for musicians Memphis Minnie, Sam Chatmon, and Tommy Johnson again with the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund.

In 2002, Raitt signed on as an official supporter of Little Kids Rock, a nonprofit organization that provides free musical instruments and free lessons to children in public schools throughout the U.S. She has visited children in the program and sits on the organization&#x27;s board of directors as an honorary member.

At the Stockholm Jazz Festival in July 2004, Raitt dedicated a performance of &quot;Your Good Thing (Is About to End)&quot;, from her 1979 album &quot;The Glow&quot;, to sitting (and later re-elected) U.S. President George W. Bush. She was quoted as saying &quot;We&#x27;re gonna sing this for George Bush because he&#x27;s out of here, people!&quot;.

In 2008, Raitt donated a song to the Aid Still Required&#x27;s CD to assist with relief efforts in Southeast Asia from the 2004 tsunami. Raitt worked with Reverb, a non-profit environmental organization, for her 2005 fall/winter and 2006 spring/summer/fall tours. Raitt is part of the No Nukes group, which opposes the expansion of nuclear power. In 2007, No Nukes recorded a music video of a new version of the Buffalo Springfield song &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;. During the 2008 Democratic primary campaign, Raitt, along with Jackson Browne and bassist James &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchinson, performed at campaign appearances for candidate John Edwards.

During the 2016 Democratic primary campaign, Raitt endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.

<text>The National Medal of Science is an honor bestowed by the President of the United States to individuals in science and engineering who have made important contributions to the advancement of knowledge in the fields of behavioral and social sciences, biology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics and physics. The twelve member presidential Committee on the National Medal of Science is responsible for selecting award recipients and is administered by the National Science Foundation (NSF). It is the highest science award in the United States.

==History==
The National Medal of Science was established on August 25, 1959, by an act of the Congress of the United States under . The medal was originally to honor scientists in the fields of the &quot;physical, biological, mathematical, or engineering sciences&quot;. The Committee on the National Medal of Science was established on August 23, 1961, by executive order 10961 of President John F. Kennedy.

On January 7, 1979, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) passed a resolution proposing that the medal be expanded to include the social and behavioral sciences. In response, Senator Ted Kennedy introduced the &quot;Science and Technology Equal Opportunities Act&quot; into the Senate on March 7, 1979, expanding the medal to include these scientific disciplines as well. President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s signature enacted this change as Public Law 96-516 on December 12, 1980.

In 1992, the National Science Foundation signed a letter of agreement with the National Science and Technology Medals Foundation that made the National Science and Technology Medals Foundation the metaorganization over both the National Medal of Science and the very similar National Medal of Technology.

The first National Medal of Science was awarded on February 18, 1963, for the year 1962 by President John F. Kennedy to Theodore von Kármán for his work at the Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The citation accompanying von Kármán&#x27;s award reads:

For his leadership in the science and engineering basic to aeronautics; for his effective teaching and related contributions in many fields of mechanics, for his distinguished counsel to the Armed Services, and for his promoting international cooperation in science and engineering.

The first woman to receive a National Medal of Science was Barbara McClintock, who was awarded for her work on plant genetics in 1970.

The awards ceremony is organized by the Office of Science and Technology Policy. It takes place at the White House and is presided by the sitting United States president.

Although Public Law 86-209 provides for 20 recipients of the medal per year, it is typical for approximately 8–15 accomplished scientists and engineers to receive this distinction each year. There have been a number of years where no National Medals of Science were awarded. Those years include: 1985, 1984, 1980, 1978, 1977, 1972 and 1971.

President Donald J. Trump did not confer any National Medals of Science during his presidency. The last time the medal was awarded before his presidency was on May 19, 2016, when President Barack Obama conferred the 2013 and 2014 medals. On October 23, 2023, President Joe Biden presented nine Medals of Science and 12 National Medals of Technology and Innovation in a ceremony in the East Room of the White House.

==Award process==

Each year the National Science Foundation sends out a call to the scientific community for the nomination of new candidates for the National Medal of Science. Individuals are nominated by their peers with each nomination requiring three letters of support from individuals in science and technology. Nominations are then sent to the Committee of the National Medal of Science which is a board composed of fourteen presidential appointees comprising twelve scientists, and two &quot;ex officio&quot; members—the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the president of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

According to the Committee, successful candidates must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents who are applying for U.S. citizenship and who have done work of significantly outstanding merit or that has had a major impact on scientific thought in their field. The Committee also values those who promote the general advancement of science and individuals who have influenced science education, although these traits are less important than groundbreaking or thought-provoking research. The nomination of a candidate is effective for three years; at the end of those three years, the candidate&#x27;s peers are allowed to renominate the candidate. The Committee makes their recommendations to the President for the final awarding decision.

==Recipients==
Since Caltech professor Theodore von Kármán received the first medal in 1962, a total of 506 medals have been awarded, with just five universities accounting for over 31% of the total. By institutional affiliation at the time of the award, Stanford University counts the most medals at 40, with Harvard University close behind at 35, followed by the University of California, Berkeley, at 30, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at 29, and the California Institute of Technology at 25.

<text>AVR is a family of microcontrollers developed since 1996 by Atmel, acquired by Microchip Technology in 2016. These are modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC single-chip microcontrollers. AVR was one of the first microcontroller families to use on-chip flash memory for program storage, as opposed to one-time programmable ROM, EPROM, or EEPROM used by other microcontrollers at the time.

AVR microcontrollers find many applications as embedded systems. They are especially common in hobbyist and educational embedded applications, popularized by their inclusion in many of the Arduino line of open hardware development boards.

== History ==
The AVR architecture was conceived by two students at the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH), Alf-Egil Bogen and Vegard Wollan.

Atmel says that the name AVR is not an acronym and does not stand for anything in particular. The creators of the AVR give no definitive answer as to what the term &quot;AVR&quot; stands for. However, it is commonly accepted that AVR stands for Alf and Vegard&#x27;s RISC processor. Note that the use of &quot;AVR&quot; in this article generally refers to the 8-bit RISC line of Atmel AVR microcontrollers.

The original AVR MCU was developed at a local ASIC house in Trondheim, Norway, called Nordic VLSI at the time, now Nordic Semiconductor, where Bogen and Wollan were working as students. It was known as a μRISC (Micro RISC) and was available as silicon IP/building block from Nordic VLSI. When the technology was sold to Atmel from Nordic VLSI, the internal architecture was further developed by Bogen and Wollan at Atmel Norway, a subsidiary of Atmel. The designers worked closely with compiler writers at IAR Systems to ensure that the AVR instruction set provided efficient compilation of high-level languages.

Among the first of the AVR line was the AT90S8515, which in a 40-pin DIP package has the same pinout as an 8051 microcontroller, including the external multiplexed address and data bus. The polarity of the RESET line was opposite (8051&#x27;s having an active-high RESET, while the AVR has an active-low RESET), but other than that the pinout was identical.

The AVR 8-bit microcontroller architecture was introduced in 1997. By 2003, Atmel had shipped 500 million AVR flash microcontrollers. The Arduino platform, developed for simple electronics projects, was released in 2005 and featured ATmega8 AVR microcontrollers.

== Device overview ==
The AVR is a modified Harvard architecture machine, where program and data are stored in separate physical memory systems that appear in different address spaces, but having the ability to read data items from program memory using special instructions.

=== Basic families ===
AVRs are generally classified into following:

tinyAVR – the ATtiny series


The ATtiny series features small package microcontrollers with a limited peripheral set available. However, the improved tinyAVR 0/1/2-series (released in 2016) include: 
* Peripherals equal to or exceed megaAVR 0-series
* Event System
* Improved AVRxt instruction set (improved timing of calls), hardware multiply

megaAVR – the ATmega series

The ATmega series features microcontrollers that provide an extended instruction set (multiply instructions and instructions for handling larger program memories), an extensive peripheral set, a solid amount of program memory, as well as a wide range of pins available. The megaAVR 0-series (released in 2016) also has functionality such as: 
* Event system
* New peripherals with enhanced functionality
* Improved AVRxt instruction set (improved timing of calls)

AVR Dx – The AVR Dx family features multiple microcontroller series, focused on HCI, analog signal conditioning and functional safety.

The parts numbers is formatted as AVR&quot;ff&quot;D&quot;xpp&quot;, where &quot;ff&quot; is flash size, &quot;x&quot; is family, and &quot;pp&quot; is number of pins. Example: AVR128DA64 – 64-pin DA-series with 128k flash. All devices in the AVR Dx family include: 
* an Async Type D timer that can run faster than the CPU
* 12-bit ADC
* 10-bit DAC
* AVR DA-series (early 2020) – The high memory density makes these MCUs well suited for both wired and wireless communication-stack-intensive functions.
** integrated sensors for capacitative touch measurement (HCI)
** updated core independent peripherals (CIPs) and a analog perihperals
** no external high frequency crystal
* AVR DB-series (mid-late 2020) – inherits many features from the DA-family, while adding its own:
** 2 or 3 on-chip opamps
** MultiVoltage IO (MVIO) on PORTC
** Supports external HF crystal
* AVR DD-series
** 16–64 KiB Flash
** 2–8 KiB SRAM
** 14–32-pin package
** internal 24 MHz oscillator
** 7–23-channel 130 kS/s 12-bit differential Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
** no amplifiers
** 1 analog comparator
** Two USARTs, one SPI, one dual-mode TWI
** Multi-Voltage Input/Output (MVIO) support on 3 or 4 pins on Port C
** 4 Configurable Custom Logic (CCL) cells, 6 Event System channels
* AVR EA-series
** 8–64 KiB Flash
** 28–48-pin package
** internal 20 MHz oscillator
** 24–32-channel 130 kS/s 12-bit differential Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
** Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA) with up to 16x gain
** 2 analog comparators
** Three USARTs, one SPI, one dual-mode TWI
** no Multi-Voltage Input/Output (MVIO)
** 4 Configurable Custom Logic (CCL) cells, 6 Event System channels

XMEGA

the ATxmega series offers a wide variety of peripherals and functionality such as:
* Extended performance features, such as DMA, &quot;Event System&quot;, and cryptography support
* Extensive peripheral set with ADCs

Application-specific AVR
* megaAVRs with special features not found on the other members of the AVR family, such as LCD controller, USB controller, advanced PWM, CAN, etc.

FPSLIC (AVR with FPGA)
* FPGA 5k to 40k gates
* SRAM for the AVR program code, unlike all other AVRs
* AVR core can run at up to 50 MHz

32-bit AVRs
* In 2006, Atmel released microcontrollers based on the 32-bit AVR32 architecture. This was a completely different architecture unrelated to the 8-bit AVR, intended to compete with the ARM-based processors. It had a 32-bit data path, SIMD and DSP instructions, along with other audio- and video-processing features. The instruction set was similar to other RISC cores, but it was not compatible with the original AVR (nor any of the various ARM cores). Since then support for AVR32 has been dropped from Linux as of kernel 4.12; compiler support for the architecture in GCC was never mainlined into the compiler&#x27;s central source-code repository and was available primarily in a vendor-supported fork. At the time that AVR32 was introduced, Atmel had already been a licensee of the ARM architecture, with both ARM7 and ARM9 microcontrollers having been released prior to and concurrently with the AVR32; later Atmel focused most development effort on 32-bit chips with ARM Cortex-M and Cortex-A cores.

=== Device architecture ===
The AVRs have 32 single-byte registers and are classified as 8-bit RISC devices.

Flash, EEPROM, and SRAM are all integrated onto a single chip, removing the need for external memory in most applications. Some devices have a parallel external bus option to allow adding additional data memory or memory-mapped devices. Almost all devices (except the smallest TinyAVR chips) have serial interfaces, which can be used to connect larger serial EEPROMs or flash chips.

==== Program memory ====
Program instructions are stored in non-volatile flash memory. Although the MCUs are 8-bit, each instruction takes one or two 16-bit words. The size of the program memory is usually indicated in the naming of the device itself (e.g., the ATmega64x line has 64 KB of flash, while the ATmega32x line has 32 KB). There is no provision for off-chip program memory; all code executed by the AVR core must reside in the on-chip flash. However, this limitation does not apply to the AT94 FPSLIC AVR/FPGA chips.

==== Internal data memory ====
The data address space consists of the register file, I/O registers, and SRAM. Some small models also map the program ROM into the data address space, but larger models do not.

==== Internal registers ====
In the tinyAVR and megaAVR variants of the AVR architecture, the working registers are mapped in as the first 32 data memory addresses (000016–001F16), followed by 64 I/O registers (002016–005F16). In devices with many peripherals, these registers are followed by 160 “extended I/O” registers, only accessible as memory-mapped I/O (006016–00FF16).

Actual SRAM starts after these register sections, at address 006016 or, in devices with &quot;extended I/O&quot;, at 010016.

Even though there are separate addressing schemes and optimized opcodes for accessing the register file and the first 64 I/O registers, all can also be addressed and manipulated as if they were in SRAM.

The very smallest of the tinyAVR variants use a reduced architecture with only 16 registers (r0 through r15 are omitted) which are not addressable as memory locations. I/O memory begins at address 000016, followed by SRAM. In addition, these devices have slight deviations from the standard AVR instruction set. Most notably, the direct load/store instructions (LDS/STS) have been reduced from 2 words (32 bits) to 1 word (16 bits), limiting the total direct addressable memory (the sum of both I/O and SRAM) to 128 bytes. Conversely, the indirect load instruction&#x27;s (LD) 16-bit address space is expanded to also include non-volatile memory such as Flash and configuration bits; therefore, the Load Program Memory (LPM) instruction is unnecessary and omitted. (For detailed info, see Atmel AVR instruction set.)

In the XMEGA variant, the working register file is not mapped into the data address space; as such, it is not possible to treat any of the XMEGA&#x27;s working registers as though they were SRAM. Instead, the I/O registers are mapped into the data address space starting at the very beginning of the address space. Additionally, the amount of data address space dedicated to I/O registers has grown substantially to 4096 bytes (000016–0FFF16). As with previous generations, however, the fast I/O manipulation instructions can only reach the first 64 I/O register locations (the first 32 locations for bitwise instructions). Following the I/O registers, the XMEGA series sets aside a 4096 byte range of the data address space, which can be used optionally for mapping the internal EEPROM to the data address space (100016–1FFF16). The actual SRAM is located after these ranges, starting at 200016.

==== GPIO ports ====
Each GPIO port on a tiny or mega AVR drives up to eight pins and is controlled by three 8-bit registers: DDR&quot;x&quot;, PORT&quot;x&quot; and PIN&quot;x&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; is the port identifier.

* DDR&quot;x&quot;: Data Direction Register, configures the pins as either inputs or outputs.
* PORT&quot;x&quot;: Output port register. Sets the output value on pins configured as outputs. Enables or disables the pull-up resistor on pins configured as inputs.
* PIN&quot;x&quot;: Input register, used to read an input signal. On some devices, this register can be used for pin toggling: writing a logic one to a PIN&quot;x&quot; bit toggles the corresponding bit in PORT&quot;x&quot;, irrespective of the setting of the DDR&quot;x&quot; bit.

Newer ATtiny AVR&#x27;s, like ATtiny817 and its siblings, have their port control registers somewhat differently defined.
xmegaAVR have additional registers for push/pull, totem-pole and pullup configurations.

==== EEPROM ====
Almost all AVR microcontrollers have internal EEPROM for semi-permanent data storage. Like flash memory, EEPROM can maintain its contents when electrical power is removed.

In most variants of the AVR architecture, this internal EEPROM memory is not mapped into the MCU&#x27;s addressable memory space. It can only be accessed the same way an external peripheral device is, using special pointer registers and read/write instructions, which makes EEPROM access much slower than other internal RAM.

However, some devices in the SecureAVR (AT90SC) family use a special EEPROM mapping to the data or program memory, depending on the configuration. The XMEGA family also allows the EEPROM to be mapped into the data address space.

Since the number of writes to EEPROM is limited Atmel specifies 100,000 write cycles in their datasheets a well designed EEPROM write routine should compare the contents of an EEPROM address with desired contents and only perform an actual write if the contents need to be changed.

=== Program execution ===
Atmel&#x27;s AVRs have a two-stage, single-level pipeline design. This means the next machine instruction is fetched as the current one is executing. Most instructions take just one or two clock cycles, making AVRs relatively fast among eight-bit microcontrollers.

The AVR processors were designed with the efficient execution of compiled C code in mind and have several built-in pointers for the task.

=== Instruction set ===

The AVR instruction set is more orthogonal than those of most eight-bit microcontrollers, in particular the 8051 clones and PIC microcontrollers with which AVR competes today. However, it is not completely regular:

* Pointer registers X, Y, and Z have addressing capabilities that are different from each other.
* Register locations R0 to R15 have more limited addressing capabilities than register locations R16 to R31.
* I/O ports 0 to 31 can be bit addressed, unlike I/O ports 32 to 63.
* CLR (clear all bits to zero) affects flags, while SER (set all bits to one) does not, even though they are complementary instructions. (CLR is pseudo-op for EOR R, R; while SER is short for LDI R,$FF. Arithmetic operations such as EOR modify flags, while moves/loads/stores/branches such as LDI do not.)
* Accessing read-only data stored in the program memory (flash) requires special LPM instructions; the flash bus is otherwise reserved for instruction memory.

Additionally, some chip-specific differences affect code generation. Code pointers (including return addresses on the stack) are two bytes long on chips with up to 128 KB of flash memory, but three bytes long on larger chips; not all chips have hardware multipliers; chips with over 8 KB of flash have branch and call instructions with longer ranges; and so forth.

The mostly regular instruction set makes C (and even Ada) compilers fairly straightforward and efficient. GCC has included AVR support for quite some time, and that support is widely used. LLVM also has rudimentary AVR support. In fact, Atmel solicited input from major developers of compilers for small microcontrollers, to determine the instruction set features that were most useful in a compiler for high-level languages.

=== MCU speed ===
The AVR line can normally support clock speeds from 0 to 20 MHz, with some devices reaching 32 MHz. Lower-powered operation usually requires a reduced clock speed. All recent (Tiny, Mega, and Xmega, but not 90S) AVRs feature an on-chip oscillator, removing the need for external clocks or resonator circuitry. Some AVRs also have a system clock prescaler that can divide down the system clock by up to 1024. This prescaler can be reconfigured by software during run-time, allowing the clock speed to be optimized.

Since all operations (excluding multiplication and 16-bit add/subtract) on registers R0–R31 are single-cycle, the AVR can achieve up to 1 MIPS per MHz, i.e. an 8 MHz processor can achieve up to 8 MIPS. Loads and stores to/from memory take two cycles, branching takes two cycles. Branches in the latest &quot;3-byte PC&quot; parts such as ATmega2560 are one cycle slower than on previous devices.

=== Development ===
AVRs have a large following due to the free and inexpensive development tools available, including reasonably priced development boards and free development software. The AVRs are sold under various names that share the same basic core, but with different peripheral and memory combinations. Compatibility between chips in each family is fairly good, although I/O controller features may vary.

See external links for sites relating to AVR development.

=== Features ===
AVRs offer a wide range of features:

* Multifunction, bi-directional general-purpose I/O ports with configurable, built-in pull-up resistors
* Multiple internal oscillators, including RC oscillator without external parts
* Internal, self-programmable instruction flash memory up to 256 KB (384 KB on XMega)
** In-system programmable using serial/parallel low-voltage proprietary interfaces or JTAG
** Optional boot code section with independent lock bits for protection
* On-chip debugging (OCD) support through JTAG or debugWIRE on most devices
** The JTAG signals (TMS, TDI, TDO, and TCK) are multiplexed on GPIOs. These pins can be configured to function as JTAG or GPIO depending on the setting of a fuse bit, which can be programmed via ISP or HVSP. By default, AVRs with JTAG come with the JTAG interface enabled.
** debugWIRE uses the /RESET pin as a bi-directional communication channel to access on-chip debug circuitry. It is present on devices with lower pin counts, as it only requires one pin.
* Internal data EEPROM up to 4 KB
* Internal SRAM up to 16 KB (32 KB on XMega)
* External 64 KB little endian data space on certain models, including the Mega8515 and Mega162.
** The external data space is overlaid with the internal data space, such that the full 64 KB address space does not appear on the external bus and accesses to e.g. address 010016 will access internal RAM, not the external bus.
** In certain members of the XMega series, the external data space has been enhanced to support both SRAM and SDRAM. As well, the data addressing modes have been expanded to allow up to 16 MB of data memory to be directly addressed.
* 8-bit and 16-bit timers
** PWM output (some devices have an enhanced PWM peripheral which includes a dead-time generator)
** Input capture that record a time stamp triggered by a signal edge
* Analog comparator
* 10 or 12-bit A/D converters, with multiplex of up to 16 channels
* 12-bit D/A converters

** I²C compatible Two-Wire Interface (TWI)
** Synchronous/asynchronous serial peripherals (UART/USART) (used with RS-232, RS-485, and more)
** Serial Peripheral Interface Bus (SPI)
** Universal Serial Interface (USI): a multi-purpose hardware communication module that can be used to implement an SPI, I2C or UART interface.
* Brownout detection
* Watchdog timer (WDT)
* Multiple power-saving sleep modes
* Lighting and motor control (PWM-specific) controller models
* CAN controller support
* USB controller support
** Proper full-speed (12 Mbit/s) hardware &amp; Hub controller with embedded AVR.
** Also freely available low-speed (1.5 Mbit/s) (HID) bitbanging software emulations
* Ethernet controller support
* LCD controller support
* Low-voltage devices operating down to 1.8 V (to 0.7 V for parts with built-in DC–DC upconverter)

There are many means to load program code into an AVR chip. The methods to program AVR chips varies from AVR family to family. Most of the methods described below use the RESET line to enter programming mode. In order to avoid the chip accidentally entering such mode, it is advised to connect a pull-up resistor between the RESET pin and the positive power supply.

=== ISP ===

The in-system programming (ISP) programming method is functionally performed through SPI, plus some twiddling of the Reset line. As long as the SPI pins of the AVR are not connected to anything disruptive, the AVR chip can stay soldered on a PCB while reprogramming. All that is needed is a 6-pin connector and programming adapter. This is the most common way to develop with an AVR.

The Atmel-ICE device or AVRISP mkII (Legacy device) connects to a computer&#x27;s USB port and performs in-system programming using Atmel&#x27;s software.

AVRDUDE (AVR Downloader/UploaDEr) runs on Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, and , and supports a variety of in-system programming hardware, including Atmel AVRISP mkII, Atmel JTAG ICE, older Atmel serial-port based programmers, and various third-party and &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; programmers.

=== PDI ===
The Program and Debug Interface (PDI) is an Atmel proprietary interface for external programming and on-chip debugging of XMEGA devices. The PDI supports high-speed programming of all non-volatile memory (NVM) spaces; flash, EEPROM, fuses, lock-bits and the User Signature Row. This is done by accessing the XMEGA NVM controller through the PDI interface, and executing NVM controller commands. The PDI is a 2-pin interface using the Reset pin for clock input (PDI_CLK) and a dedicated data pin (PDI_DATA) for input and output.

=== UPDI ===
The Unified Program and Debug Interface (UPDI) is a one-wire interface for external programming and on-chip debugging of newer ATtiny and ATmega devices. UPDI chips can be programmed by an Atmel-ICE, a PICkit 4, an Arduino (flashed with jtag2updi), or though a UART (with a resistor between the TX and RX pins) controlled by Microchip&#x27;s Python utility pymcuprog.

=== High-voltage serial ===
High-voltage serial programming (HVSP) is mostly the backup mode on smaller AVRs. An 8-pin AVR package does not leave many unique signal combinations to place the AVR into a programming mode. A 12-volt signal, however, is something the AVR should only see during programming and never during normal operation. The high voltage mode can also be used in some devices where the reset pin has been disabled by fuses.

=== High-voltage parallel ===
High-voltage parallel programming (HVPP) is considered the &quot;final resort&quot; and may be the only way to correct bad fuse settings on an AVR chip.

=== Bootloader ===
Most AVR models can reserve a bootloader region, 256 bytes to 4 KB, where re-programming code can reside. At reset, the bootloader runs first and does some user-programmed determination whether to re-program or to jump to the main application. The code can re-program through any interface available, or it could read an encrypted binary through an Ethernet adapter like PXE. Atmel has application notes and code pertaining to many bus interfaces.

=== ROM ===
The AT90SC series of AVRs are available with a factory mask-ROM rather than flash for program memory. Because of the large up-front cost and minimum order quantity, a mask-ROM is only cost-effective for high-production runs.

=== aWire ===
aWire is a new one-wire debug interface available on the new UC3L AVR32 devices.

== Debugging interfaces ==

The AVR offers several options for debugging, mostly involving on-chip debugging while the chip is in the target system.

=== debugWIRE ===

debugWIRE is Atmel&#x27;s solution for providing on-chip debug capabilities via a single microcontroller pin. It is particularly useful for lower pin-count parts which cannot provide the four &quot;spare&quot; pins needed for JTAG. The JTAGICE mkII, mkIII and the AVR Dragon support debugWIRE. debugWIRE was developed after the original JTAGICE release, and now clones support it.

=== JTAG ===
The Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) feature provides access to on-chip debugging functionality while the chip is running in the target system. JTAG allows accessing internal memory and registers, setting breakpoints on code, and single-stepping execution to observe system behaviour.

Atmel provides a series of JTAG adapters for the AVR:

# The Atmel-ICE is the latest adapter. It supports JTAG, debugWire, aWire, SPI, TPI, and PDI interfaces.
# The JTAGICE 3 is a midrange debugger in the JTAGICE family (JTAGICE mkIII). It supports JTAG, aWire, SPI, and PDI interfaces.
# The JTAGICE mkII replaces the JTAGICE and is similarly priced. The JTAGICE mkII interfaces to the PC via USB, and supports both JTAG and the newer debugWIRE interface. Numerous third-party clones of the Atmel JTAGICE mkII device started shipping after Atmel released the communication protocol.
# The AVR Dragon is a low-cost (approximately $50) substitute for the JTAGICE mkII for certain target parts. The AVR Dragon provides in-system serial programming, high-voltage serial programming and parallel programming, as well as JTAG or debugWIRE emulation for parts with 32 KB of program memory or less. ATMEL changed the debugging feature of AVR Dragon with the latest firmware of AVR Studio 4 – AVR Studio 5 and now it supports devices over 32 KB of program memory.
# The JTAGICE adapter interfaces to the PC via a standard serial port. Although the JTAGICE adapter has been declared &quot;end-of-life&quot; by Atmel, it is still supported in AVR Studio and other tools.

JTAG can also be used to perform a boundary scan test, which tests the electrical connections between AVRs and other boundary scan capable chips in a system. Boundary scan is well-suited for a production line, while the hobbyist is probably better off testing with a multimeter or oscilloscope.

== Development tools and evaluation kits ==

Official Atmel AVR development tools and evaluation kits contain a number of starter kits and debugging tools with support for most AVR devices:

=== STK600 starter kit ===
The STK600 starter kit and development system is an update to the STK500. The STK600 uses a base board, a signal routing board, and a target board.

The base board is similar to the STK500, in that it provides a power supply, clock, in-system programming, an RS-232 port and a CAN (Controller Area Network, an automotive standard) port via DE9 connectors, and stake pins for all of the GPIO signals from the target device.

The target boards have ZIF sockets for DIP, SOIC, QFN, or QFP packages, depending on the board.

The signal routing board sits between the base board and the target board, and routes the signals to the proper pin on the device board. There are many different signal routing boards that could be used with a single target board, depending on what device is in the ZIF socket.

The STK600 allows in-system programming from the PC via USB, leaving the RS-232 port available for the target microcontroller. A 4 pin header on the STK600 labeled &#x27;RS-232 spare&#x27; can connect any TTL level USART port on the chip to an onboard MAX232 chip to translate the signals to RS-232 levels. The RS-232 signals are connected to the RX, TX, CTS, and RTS pins on the DB-9 connector.

=== STK500 starter kit ===
The STK500 starter kit and development system features ISP and high voltage programming (HVP) for all AVR devices, either directly or through extension boards. The board is fitted with DIP sockets for all AVRs available in DIP packages.

STK500 Expansion Modules:
Several expansion modules are available for the STK500 board:

* STK501 – Adds support for microcontrollers in 64-pin TQFP packages.
* STK502 – Adds support for LCD AVRs in 64-pin TQFP packages.
* STK503 – Adds support for microcontrollers in 100-pin TQFP packages.
* STK504 – Adds support for LCD AVRs in 100-pin TQFP packages.
* STK505 – Adds support for 14 and 20-pin AVRs.
* STK520 – Adds support for 14 and 20, and 32-pin microcontrollers from the AT90PWM and ATmega family.
* STK524 – Adds support for the ATmega32M1/C1 32-pin CAN/LIN/Motor Control family.
* STK525 – Adds support for the AT90USB microcontrollers in 64-pin TQFP packages.
* STK526 – Adds support for the AT90USB microcontrollers in 32-pin TQFP packages.

=== STK200 starter kit ===
The STK200 starter kit and development system has a DIP socket that can host an AVR chip in a 40, 20, or 8-pin package. The board has a 4 MHz clock source, 8 light-emitting diode (LED)s, 8 input buttons, an RS-232 port, a socket for a 32 KB SRAM and numerous general I/O. The chip can be programmed with a dongle connected to the parallel port.

=== Atmel-ICE ===
The Atmel ICE is the currently supported inexpensive tool to program and debug all AVR devices (unlike the AVRISP/AVRISP mkII, Dragon, etc. discussed below). It connects to and receives power from a PC via USB, and supports JTAG, PDI, aWire, debugWIRE, SPI, SWD, TPI, and UPDI (the Microchip Unified Program and Debug Interface) interfaces.

The ICE can program and debug all AVRs via the JTAG interface, and program with additional interfaces as supported on each device:
* 8-bit AVR XMEGA devices via the PDI 2-wire interface
* 8-bit megaAVR and tinyAVR devices via SPI for all with OCD (on-chip debugger) support
* 8-bit tinyAVR microcontrollers with TPI support
* 32-bit SAM Arm Cortex-M based microcontrollers via SWD

Target operating voltage ranges of 1.62V to 5.5V are supported as well as the following clock ranges:
* Supports JTAG &amp; PDI clock frequencies from 32 kHz to 7.5 MHz
* Supports aWire baud rates from 7.5 kbit/s to 7 Mbit/s
* Supports debugWIRE baud rates from 4 kbit/s to 0.5 Mbit/s
* Supports SPI clock frequencies from 8 kHz to 5 MHz
* Supports SWD clock frequencies from 32 kHz to 2 MHz

The ICE is supported by the Microchip Studio IDE, as well as a command line interface (atprogram).

The Atmel-ICE supports a limited implementation of the Data Gateway Interface (DGI) when debugging and programming features are not in use. The Data Gateway Interface is an interface for streaming data from a target device to the connected computer. This is meant as a useful adjunct to the unit to allow for demonstration of application features and as an aid in application level debugging.

=== AVRISP and AVRISP mkII ===

The AVRISP and AVRISP mkII are inexpensive tools allowing all AVRs to be programmed via ICSP.

The AVRISP connects to a PC via a serial port and draws power from the target system. The AVRISP allows using either of the &quot;standard&quot; ICSP pinouts, either the 10-pin or 6-pin connector.

The AVRISP mkII connects to a PC via USB and draws power from USB. LEDs visible through the translucent case indicate the state of target power.

As the AVRISP mkII lacks driver/buffer ICs, it can have trouble programming target boards with multiple loads on its SPI lines. In such occurrences, a programmer capable of sourcing greater current is required. Alternatively, the AVRISP mkII can still be used if low-value (~150 ohm) load-limiting resistors can be placed on the SPI lines before each peripheral device.

Both the AVRISP and the AVRISP mkII are now discontinued, with product pages removed from the Microchip website. As of July 2019 the AVRISP mkII is still in stock at a number of distributors. There are also a number of 3rd party clones available.

=== AVR Dragon ===

The Atmel Dragon is an inexpensive tool which connects to a PC via USB. The Dragon can program all AVRs via JTAG, HVP, PDI, or ICSP. The Dragon also allows debugging of all AVRs via JTAG, PDI, or debugWire; a previous limitation to devices with 32 KB or less program memory has been removed in AVR Studio 4.18. The Dragon has a small prototype area which can accommodate an 8, 28, or 40-pin AVR, including connections to power and programming pins. There is no area for any additional circuitry, although this can be provided by a third-party product called the &quot;Dragon Rider&quot;.

=== JTAGICE ===
The JTAG In Circuit Emulator (JTAGICE) debugging tool supports on-chip debugging (OCD) of AVRs with a JTAG interface. The original JTAGICE (sometimes retroactively referred to as JTAGICE mkI) uses an RS-232 interface to a PC and can only program AVR&#x27;s with a JTAG interface. The JTAGICE mkI is no longer in production, however it has been replaced by the JTAGICE mkII.

=== JTAGICE mkII ===
The JTAGICE mkII debugging tool supports on-chip debugging (OCD) of AVRs with SPI, JTAG, PDI, and debugWIRE interfaces. The debugWire interface enables debugging using only one pin (the Reset pin), allowing debugging of applications running on low pin-count microcontrollers.

The JTAGICE mkII connects using USB, but there is an alternate connection via a serial port, which requires using a separate power supply. In addition to JTAG, the mkII supports ISP programming (using 6-pin or 10-pin adapters). Both the USB and serial links use a variant of the STK500 protocol.

=== JTAGICE3 ===
The JTAGICE3 updates the mkII with more advanced debugging capabilities and faster programming. It connects via USB and supports the JTAG, aWire, SPI, and PDI interfaces. The kit includes several adapters for use with most interface pinouts.

=== AVR ONE! ===
The AVR ONE! is a professional development tool for all Atmel 8-bit and 32-bit AVR devices with On-Chip Debug capability. It supports SPI, JTAG, PDI, and aWire programming modes and debugging using debugWIRE, JTAG, PDI, and aWire interfaces.

=== Butterfly demonstration board ===
The very popular AVR Butterfly demonstration board is a self-contained, battery-powered computer running the Atmel AVR ATmega169V microcontroller. It was built to show off the AVR family, especially a then new built-in LCD interface. The board includes the LCD screen, joystick, speaker, serial port, real time clock (RTC), flash memory chip, and both temperature and voltage sensors. Earlier versions of the AVR Butterfly also contained a CdS photoresistor; it is not present on Butterfly boards produced after June 2006 to allow RoHS compliance. The small board has a shirt pin on its back so it can be worn as a name badge.

The AVR Butterfly comes preloaded with software to demonstrate the capabilities of the microcontroller. Factory firmware can scroll your name, display the sensor readings, and show the time. The AVR Butterfly also has a piezoelectric transducer that can be used to reproduce sounds and music.

The AVR Butterfly demonstrates LCD driving by running a 14-segment, six alpha-numeric character display. However, the LCD interface consumes many of the I/O pins.

The Butterfly&#x27;s ATmega169 CPU is capable of speeds up to 8 MHz, but it is factory set by software to 2 MHz to preserve the button battery life. A pre-installed bootloader program allows the board to be re-programmed via a standard RS-232 serial plug with new programs that users can write with the free Atmel IDE tools.

=== AT90USBKey ===
This small board, about half the size of a business card, is priced at slightly more than an AVR Butterfly. It includes an AT90USB1287 with USB On-The-Go (OTG) support, 16 MB of DataFlash, LEDs, a small joystick, and a temperature sensor. The board includes software, which lets it act as a USB mass storage device (its documentation is shipped on the DataFlash), a USB joystick, and more. To support the USB host capability, it must be operated from a battery, but when running as a USB peripheral, it only needs the power provided over USB.

Only the JTAG port uses conventional 2.54 mm pinout. All the other AVR I/O ports require more compact 1.27 mm headers.

The AVR Dragon can both program and debug since the 32 KB limitation was removed in AVR Studio 4.18, and the JTAGICE mkII is capable of both programming and debugging the processor. The processor can also be programmed through USB from a Windows or Linux host, using the USB &quot;Device Firmware Update&quot; protocols. Atmel ships proprietary (source code included but distribution restricted) example programs and a USB protocol stack with the device.

LUFA is a third-party free software (MIT license) USB protocol stack for the USBKey and other 8-bit USB AVRs.

=== Raven wireless kit ===
The RAVEN kit supports wireless development using Atmel&#x27;s IEEE 802.15.4 chipsets, for Zigbee and other wireless stacks. It resembles a pair of wireless more-powerful Butterfly cards, plus a wireless USBKey; and costing about that much (under $US100). All these boards support JTAG-based development.

The kit includes two AVR Raven boards, each with a 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting IEEE 802.15.4 (and a freely licensed Zigbee stack). The radios are driven with ATmega1284p processors, which are supported by a custom segmented LCD driven by an ATmega3290p processor. Raven peripherals resemble the Butterfly: piezo speaker, DataFlash (bigger), external EEPROM, sensors, 32 kHz crystal for RTC, and so on. These are intended for use in developing remote sensor nodes, to control relays, or whatever is needed.

The USB stick uses an AT90USB1287 for connections to a USB host and to the 2.4 GHz wireless links. These are intended to monitor and control the remote nodes, relying on host power rather than local batteries.

=== Third-party programmers ===
A wide variety of third-party programming and debugging tools are available for the AVR. These devices use various interfaces, including RS-232, PC parallel port, and USB. 

== Uses ==

AVRs have been used in various automotive applications such as security, safety, powertrain and entertainment systems. Atmel has recently launched a new publication &quot;Atmel Automotive Compilation&quot; to help developers with automotive applications. Some current usages are in BMW, Daimler-Chrysler and TRW.

The Arduino physical computing platform is based on an ATmega328 microcontroller (ATmega168 or ATmega8 in board versions older than the Diecimila). The ATmega1280 and ATmega2560, with more pinout and memory capabilities, have also been employed to develop the Arduino Mega platform. Arduino boards can be used with its language and IDE, or with more conventional programming environments (C, assembler, etc.) as just standardized and widely available AVR platforms.

USB-based AVRs have been used in the Microsoft Xbox hand controllers. The link between the controllers and Xbox is USB.

Numerous companies produce AVR-based microcontroller boards intended for use by hobbyists, robot builders, experimenters and small system developers including: Cubloc, gnusb, BasicX, Oak Micros, ZX Microcontrollers, and myAVR. There is also a large community of Arduino-compatible boards supporting similar users.

Schneider Electric used to produce the M3000 Motor and Motion Control Chip, incorporating an Atmel AVR Core and an advanced motion controller for use in a variety of motion applications but this has been discontinued.

== FPGA clones ==
With the growing popularity of FPGAs among the open source community, people have started developing open source processors compatible with the AVR instruction set. The OpenCores website lists the following major AVR clone projects:

* pAVR, written in VHDL, is aimed at creating the fastest and maximally featured AVR processor, by implementing techniques not found in the original AVR processor such as deeper pipelining.
* avr_core, written in VHDL, is a clone aimed at being as close as possible to the ATmega103.
* Navré, written in Verilog, implements all Classic Core instructions and is aimed at high performance and low resource usage. It does not support interrupts.
* softavrcore, written in Verilog, implements the AVR instruction set up to AVR5, supports interrupts along with optional automatic interrupt acknowledgement, power saving via sleep mode plus some peripheral interfaces and hardware accelerators (such as UART, SPI, cyclic redundancy check calculation unit and system timers). These peripherals demonstrate how could these be attached to and configured for this core. Within the package, a full-featured FreeRTOS port is also available as an example for the core + peripheral utilization.
* The opencores project CPU lecture written in VHDL by Dr. Jürgen Sauermann explains in detail how to design a complete AVR-based system on a chip (SoC).

== Other vendors ==
In addition to the chips manufactured by Atmel, clones are available from LogicGreen Technologies. These parts are not exact clones – they have a few features not found in the chips they are &quot;clones&quot; of, and higher maximum clock speeds, but use SWD (Serial Wire Debug, a variant of JTAG from ARM) instead of ISP for programming, so different programming tools must be used.

Microcontrollers using the ATmega architecture are being manufactured by NIIET in Voronezh, Russia, as part of the 1887 series of integrated circuits. This includes an ATmega128 under the designation 1887VE7T ().

<text>The New Orleans Pelicans or &quot;Pels&quot; were a minor league professional baseball team based in New Orleans, Louisiana.

==History==
Founded in 1865 as an amateur social/sporting organization, the Pelicans became a professional franchise when they joined the Southern League in 1887. That league operated off and on until it finally folded in 1899. During that time the team captured three pennants: 1887, 1889, and 1896. The Pelicans then became a founding member of the Southern Association in 1901. From 1887 to 1900, the team played at Sportsman&#x27;s Park/Crescent City Base Ball Park located at the foot of Canal Street near the New Basin Canal (now the Pontchartrain Expressway).

In 1901, the Pelicans moved to Athletic Park and played there until 1908. After the 1908 season the team moved to Pelican Park, which was located on South Carrollton Avenue, across from present-day Jesuit High School. In 1914, the Pelican Park wooden grandstand was moved by mule teams a quarter-mile down South Carrollton Avenue to the intersection with Tulane Avenue in Mid-City New Orleans. From 1915 through 1936 the facility was known as Heinemann Park after Alexander J. Heinemann, a shareholder in the club and owner of the stadium. The name was changed in 1936 to Pelican Stadium following the death of Heinemann and team owner Charles Somers. The Pelicans played their final game there in 1957. After this, they played for two years at City Park Stadium, now called Tad Gormley Stadium, in City Park. The franchise was sold to Little Rock at the end of the 1959 season. The Southern Association folded after the 1961 season.

The Pelicans won the Dixie Series, a postseason interleague championship between the champions of the Southern Association and the Texas League, in 1933 and 1934.

Notable Pelicans included Shoeless Joe Jackson, Jimmy Dygert, Henry &quot;Cotton&quot; Knaupp, Bill Lindsay, Zeke Bonura, Gene Freese, and Hall of Famers Dazzy Vance, Joe Sewell, Bob Lemon, and Earl Weaver. In Jackson&#x27;s only season with New Orleans (1910), he hit .354 to win the league batting title and led the team to the pennant with an 87–53 record. The following year, he would hit .408 with the American League&#x27;s Cleveland Naps.

In the 1950s, the team was associated with the Pittsburgh Pirates and was managed by Danny Murtaugh. Other notable Pelican managers included Larry Gilbert and Abner Powell, with the latter credited with introducing the perforated &quot;rain check&quot; in 1889.

The Pelicans&#x27; name briefly resurfaced during the 1977 season when oilman A. Ray Smith moved his Triple-A Tulsa Oilers to New Orleans to play in the Superdome. Tony La Russa was a reserve infielder for the team, playing most of his games at 2nd base. After a single season, the team then moved to Springfield, Illinois, and was renamed the Redbirds.

==Name revival==
On December 4, 2012, it was reported that Tom Benson, owner of the NFL&#x27;s New Orleans Saints and the NBA&#x27;s New Orleans Hornets, would be changing the Hornets&#x27; official name to the Pelicans, possibly as early as the 2013–2014 NBA season.

These reports were officially confirmed on January 24, 2013, when the newly branded Pelicans officially announced the name change and unveiled accompanying logos and a blue, gold and red color scheme. One year later, the Hornets name, logo and color scheme were reclaimed by the now Charlotte Hornets. The basketball Hornets originally came from Charlotte, North Carolina, before relocating to New Orleans in 2002.

The Pelicans were affiliated with the following major league teams:

<text>The Mouride brotherhood (, &quot;aṭ-Ṭarīqat al-Murīdiyyah&quot; or simply , &quot;al-Murīdiyyah&quot;) is a large &quot;tariqa&quot; (Sufi order) most prominent in Senegal and The Gambia with headquarters in the city of Touba, which is a holy city for the order. Adherents are called Mourides, from the Arabic word &quot;murīd&quot; (literally &quot;one who desires&quot;), a term used generally in Sufism to designate a disciple of a spiritual guide. The beliefs and practices of the Mourides constitute Mouridism. Mouride disciples call themselves &quot;taalibé&quot; in Wolof and must undergo a ritual of allegiance called &quot;njebbel&quot;, as it is considered highly important to have a sheikh &quot;spiritual guide&quot; in order to become a Mouride. The Mouride brotherhood was founded in 1883 in Senegal by Amadou Bamba. The Mouride make up around 40 percent of the total population, and their influence over everyday life can be seen throughout Senegal.

==History==

===Founding ===

The Mouride brotherhood was founded in 1883 in Senegal by &quot;Shaykh&quot; Aḥmadu Bàmba Mbàkke (Wolof name), commonly known as Amadou Bamba (1850–1927). In Arabic, he is known as Aḥmad ibn Muhammad ibn Habīb Allāh or by the nickname &quot;Khadīmu r-Rasūl&quot; (&quot;Servant of the Prophet&quot;). In Wolof he is called &quot;Sëriñ Tuubaa&quot; (&quot;Holy Man of Touba&quot;). He was born in the village of Mbacké in Baol, the son of a Cheikh from the Qadiriyya, the oldest of the Muslim brotherhoods in Senegal.

Amadou Bamba was a Muslim mystic and ascetic &quot;marabout&quot;, a spiritual leader who wrote tracts on meditation, rituals, work, and &quot;tafsir&quot;. He is perhaps best known for his emphasis on work, and his disciples are known for their industriousness. Although he did not support the French conquest of West Africa, he did not wage outright war on them, as several prominent Tijani &quot;cheikh&quot; had done. He taught, instead, what he called the &quot;jihād al-akbar&quot; or &quot;greater struggle,&quot; which fought not through weapons but through learning and fear of God.

Bamba&#x27;s followers call him a &quot;mujaddid&quot; (a &quot;renewer of Islam&quot;). Bamba&#x27;s fame spread through his followers, and people joined him to receive the salvation that he promised. Salvation, he said, comes through submission to the &quot;cheikh&quot; and hard work.

There is only one surviving photograph of Amadou Bamba, in which he wears a flowing white kaftan and his face is mostly covered by a scarf. This picture is venerated and reproduced in paintings on walls, buses, taxis, and other private and public spaces all over modern-day Senegal.

===French colonial rule===

At the time of the foundation of the Mouride brotherhood in 1883, the French were in control of Senegal as well as most of West and North Africa. Although it had shared in the horrors of the pre-colonial slave trade, French West Africa was managed relatively better than other African regions during the Scramble for Africa and ensuing colonial era. Senegal enjoyed small measures of self-rule in many areas. However, French rule still discouraged the development of local industry, preferring to force the exchange of raw materials for European finished goods, and a large number of taxation measures were instituted.
At the end of the 19th century, French colonial authorities began to worry about the growing power of the Mouride brotherhood and its potential to resist French colonialism. Bamba, who had converted various kings and their followers, could probably have raised an army against the French had he wanted. Fearful of his power, the French sentenced Bamba to exile in Gabon (1895–1902) and later Mauritania (1903–1907) and confining him in house arrest in Senegal until 1912.

However, Bamba&#x27;s exile fueled legends about his miraculous ability to survive torture, deprivation, and attempted executions, and thousands more flocked to his organization. For example, on the ship to Gabon, forbidden from praying, Bamba is said to have broken his leg-irons, leapt overboard into the ocean, and prayed on a prayer rug that miraculously appeared on the surface of the water. In addition, when the French put him in a furnace, he is said to have simply sat down and had tea with Muhammad. In a den of hungry lions, it is said the lions slept beside him.

By 1912, policy shifted towards using the Senegalese Sufi orders – among them the Mourides – as assets in the colonial administration. This way, it was thought, the authority and power of the orders could instead be used to support colonial rule. In order to facilitate rapprochement and in an attempt to limit the appearance of Bamba as a freedom fighter, he was released from house arrest and moved back to Diourbel, close to the future site of Touba. The Mouride doctrine of hard work served French economic interests, as addressed below. After World War I, the Mouride brotherhood was allowed to grow and in 1926 Bamba began work on the Great Mosque in Touba, where he would be buried one year later.

Bamba’s successors were increasingly cordial with the French administration, collaborating and receiving support against rivals and material benefits such as land and machinery in return. This led to the brotherhood’s authority becoming part of a form of indirect rule by the French. In 1928 the French colonial administration issued a deed recognizing the land of Bamba’s tomb and the Great Mosque as private property of the Mouride community. This marked the first step towards Touba’s autonomy from the wider Senegalese state which continued post-independence. 

The Mourides played a central role in the 1958 Senegalese constitutional referendum which determined whether Senegal would become part of the new French Community. The leaders of the main Senegalese Sufi orders jointly announced their loyalty to Charles de Gaulle and their support of the proposed French Community. Their campaigning, supported by the French Administration, led to the overwhelming yes of nearly 98% being coined “the marabouts’ Yes.”

==Structure==

===Leadership===
Shaikh Amadou Bamba was buried in 1927 at the Great Mosque in Touba, the holy city of Mouridism and the heart of the Mouride movement. After his death Bamba has been succeeded by his descendants as hereditary leaders of the brotherhood. The &quot;caliph&quot; (leader) of the Mouride brotherhood is known as the &quot;Grand Marabout&quot; and has his seat in Touba. The first five caliphs were all sons of Amadou Bamba, starting with his eldest son:

# Serigne Mouhamadou Moustapha Mbacké, caliph from 1927 to 1945
# Serigne Mouhamadou Fallilou Mbacké, caliph from 1945 to 1968
# Serigne Abdou Ahad Mbacké, caliph from 1968 to 1989
# Serigne Abdou Khadr Mbacké, caliph from 1989 to 1990
# Serigne Saliou Mbacké (1915-2007), caliph from 1990 until his death on December 28, 2007
# Serigne Mouhamadou Lamine Bara Mbacké, (1925–2010), caliph from 2007 to 2010. He was the first grandson of Ahmadou Bamba to become caliph.
# Serigne Sidi Moukhtar Mbacké, caliph from July 1, 2010 until his death on January 9, 2018.
# Serigne Mountakha Mbacké, incumbent caliph since January 10, 2018.

The &quot;Grand Marabout&quot; is a direct descendant of Amadou Bamba himself and is considered the spiritual leader of all Mourides. There are other &quot;marabouts&quot;, each with a regional following.

===Dahiras===
&quot;Dahiras&quot; are a unique institution of the Senegalese Sufi model which connect followers of a particular marabout or order in an association. They are often based on shared allegiances to a particular marabout or common geographical location, for example, a neighborhood or city-specific dahira. Other dahiras bring together followers belonging to the same age, gender, occupation, or school, linking them across Senegal and even abroad. A key example of this is the &quot;Hizbut-Tarqiyyah&quot;, which brought together Mouride students and alumni of the University of Dakar. Notably many Mouride dahiras name the Grand Marabout as their patron and thereby avoid allegiance to a specific marabout inside the order.

Dahiras first appeared in urban areas as religious solidarity and mutual aid groups to tackle the issues of urban migrants but have since spread across the country to rural areas as well. Next to providing a community of like-minded Mourides, they help facilitate the participation of members at important festivals and help raise funds for sudden expenses which individuals may be unable to cover themselves, such as funeral costs.

===Daaras===
&quot;Daaras&quot; are &quot;madrassas&quot; or Quranic schools. They were originally founded by the shaykh, his descendants, or disciples to teach the Quran and the khassida (or &quot;xassida&quot;, poems honoring Muhammad) as well as cultivating the land. Hence they have grown to be associations of Mourides, generally based on shared allegiance to a particular &quot;marabout&quot;.

===Sects===

====Baye Fall====
One famous disciple of Bamba, Ibrahima Fall, was known for his dedication to God and considered work as a form of adoration. Fall was the one to introduce the conduct with which a disciple should interact with his Shaykh, based on the example of the Sahabas and concepts presented in the 49th chapter of the Quran Al-Hujurat. Ibrahima Fall was responsible for guiding many of Bamba&#x27;s more eccentric followers and new converts to Islam. His followers were the precursor to a subgroup of the Mouride brotherhood today referred to as the Baye Fall (), many of whom substitute hard labor and dedication to their marabout for the usual Muslim pieties.

Sheikh Ibrahima Fall was one of the first of Amadou Bamba&#x27;s disciples and one of the most illustrious. He catalysed the Mouride movement and led all the labour work in the Mouride brotherhood. Fall reshaped the relation between Mouride &quot;talibes&quot; (disciples) and their guide, Amadou Bamba. Fall instituted the culture of work among Mourides with his concept of &quot;Dieuf Dieul&quot;, (&quot;you reap what you sow&quot;). Ibra Fall helped Amadou Bamba to expand Mouridism, in particular with Fall&#x27;s establishment of the Baye Fall movement. For this contribution, Serigne Fallou, the second &quot;Caliph&quot; (leader) after Amadou Bamba, named him &quot;Lamp Fall&quot; (the light of Mouridism). In addition, Ibrahima Fall earned the title &quot;Bab al-Murīdīna&quot;, &quot;Gate of the Mourides.&quot;

The members of the Baye Fall dress in colorful ragged clothes, wear their hair in dreadlocks which are called &quot;ndiange&quot; (&quot;strong hair&quot;), which they decorate usually with homemade beads, wire or string. They also carry clubs, and act as security guards in the annual &quot;Grand Magal&quot; pilgrimages to Touba. Women usually are covered in draping coverings including their heads and occasionally are known to wear highly decorative handmade jewelry made from household or natural items. In modern times the hard labor is often replaced by members roaming the streets asking for financial donations for their &quot;marabout&quot;. Several Baye Fall are talented musicians. A prominent member of the Baye Fall is the Senegalese musician Cheikh Lô.
==Beliefs==
=== The Three Pillars of Mouridism ===
Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba taught the Three Pillars of Mouridism:
* Islam by Fiqh
* Iman by The Six Articles of Faith
* Ihsan by Tasawwuf (Sufism)
In summary, a Mouride aspires to achieve Islam by following the basic recommendations of &quot;Shariat&quot;. This includes (but is not limited to) performing individual obligations (&quot;Fard Ayn&quot;) such as prayer, ablution, fasting, pilgrimage and giving charity. A Mouride aspires to achieve &quot;Iman&quot; by the Six Articles of Faith: Belief in God, his angels, the prophets, the revealed Holy Books, the Day of Judgment and the Divine Decree. A Mouride aspires to achieve &quot;Ihsan&quot; by the path of &quot;Tasawwuf&quot; (Sufism) through taking initiation (&quot;Bayat&quot;) with a Sheikh of the &quot;Tariqat&quot;.

=== The Mouride Triangle ===
Additionally to the Three Pillars of Mouridism, the Mourides follow what is called the Mouride Triangle:
* &quot;Love&quot;: Love for Allâh and his Cheikhs
* &quot;Service&quot;: Work for Allâh and service for humanity
* &quot;Knowledge&quot;: With Love and Work over time follows divine light of Allah and knowledge directly to the heart

=== Renewer of Islam (Mujaddid) ===
Amadou Bamba is considered a &quot;mujaddid&quot; (renewer of Islam) by his followers, citing a &quot;hadith&quot; that implies that God will send renewers of the faith every 100 years. The members of all the Senegalese brotherhoods claim that their founders were such renewers. The Mouride beliefs are based on Quranic and Sufi traditions and influenced by the Qadiri and Tijani brotherhoods, as well as the works by the scholar al-Ghazali. Amadou Bamba wrote more than 1000 books in Classical Arabic, all of which are based on the Quran and &quot;Hadith&quot;. Ahmadou Bamba said &quot;If it&#x27;s not in the Qur&#x27;an or Hadith, it&#x27;s not from me&quot;.
Mourides sometimes call their order the &quot;Way of Imitation of the Prophet&quot;. Parents sometimes send their sons to live with the &quot;marabout&quot; as &quot;talibes&quot; rather than giving them a conventional education. These boys receive Islamic training and are instilled with the doctrine of hard work.

Many Mourides consider the city of Touba as equally or even more important than Mecca. Pilgrims regularly come to Touba all year round, but the peak of the year is a mass pilgrimage called the Grand Màgal, which celebrates Bamba&#x27;s return from exile.

=== Relationship with Reform Movement ===
As in other parts of West Africa and the wider Muslim world, the return of students from the Salafist and Wahhabist-influenced Islamic universities in the Middle East brought a new Islamic Reform movement to Senegal post-Second World War. As these movements rejected many of the Sufi traditions and foundations that marked Islam in West Africa, and had been linked to the idea of an “&quot;Islam noir&quot;” by French colonial administrators, they opposed the marabouts, their cooperation with the French colonial system, and their authoritarian position inside Senegal’s religious system.
The Mourides’ strong economic position and political influence (see below), system of unconditional submission to their marabouts, and focus on labour over prayer, made them a natural target of the reformers. The importance of marabouts and saints in Mouride thought was seen as &quot;&quot;. This also extended to locations, with reformers opposing the central role of the holy city of Touba and the Mouride tradition of spending significant amounts of money to transport dead relatives to be buried in the city. On a more popular level, the eccentricities of the Baye Fall have also been associated with the Mourides as a whole and been used to criticise them by various non-Mourides.

However, the central role of Mourides in Senegal has meant that even some Salafist-inspired reform movements have, over time, softened anti-maraboutic stances in order to focus on other issues, at times even cooperating with notable Mourides in order to gain popular support and pursue goals appealing to most Muslims. Other types of reform have come from inside the Mouride order, with younger marabouts drawing inspirations from reformists and West African Pentecostalism. They combine these inspirations with aspects of traditional Mouride beliefs, offering new forms of worship removed from the gerontocratic traditional order and incorporating modern media while calling for a return to a mythologised Mouride past of rejecting authority. These interactions and new movements highlight Islamic Studies professor Rüdiger Seeseman’s argument that rather than treating Sufism and reform Islam as unchanging and opposed, these movements interact and lead to new forms of thoughts which incorporate beliefs to best address the situations they find themselves in.

==Influence in Senegal==
===Political influence===
The Mourides have wielded significant political influence on the national and local scale for most of their history. In a 1965 survey, elite Senegalese named Mouride Grand Marabout Fallilou Mbacké as the second most influential person in the country. Since then, the order has been described as having played a major role in fostering consent for government policies, and as being important political power brokers. As part of the &quot;njebbel&quot;, a loyal Mouride is ideologically required to follow his religious leaders’ instructions or risk of losing any material support that would have been given to him if he disregards them.

Marabouts very rarely themselves participate directly in the political process. What is more common is to see them exert their influence over their followers and use this in return to gain a larger presence in the Senegalese politics. Such things as withholding seed from granaries, unless followers purchase party cards, is a way that some marabouts exert their influence in the region to attain votes. Other marabout may actually seek out political office, but most prefer to use their influence as an intermediary of politics in Senegal.

As noted above, following a period of repression, French colonial administrators recognized that the Mouride brotherhood was well-respected among the Senegalese and partnered with them to promote political and social order. Traditional Wolof aristocrats had proven problematic as intermediaries for the colonial authorities, and they hoped that Mouride leaders would be more effective and legitimate.
During the French colonial reign, the marabouts usually gave their support to politicians based upon their support of the brotherhood&#x27;s leaders and interests. The most notable of these was Blaise Diagne, whose successful campaign to the Chamber of Deputies in 1914 they subsidized. Together with the continued cooperation with the colonial administration, this successful partnership built the foundation for the future cooperation between the Senegalese government and the Mouride brotherhood. This was further strengthened by the close alliance with Léopold Senghor, who had courted the Mourides and other Sufi orders from early on. Senghor campaigned on stabilizing the price of groundnuts, vital to Mouride economic interests (see below) and promised to subsidize the completion of the Grand Mosque of Touba. In this way Senghor gained the electoral support of the Mourides while the order and the Grand Marabout benefitted from investments in Touba’s infrastructure and the symbolic power of state support.

After universal suffrage was given in 1956, Senegal saw a rapid increase in the number of voters, almost triple the number just 10 years prior. This swift increase meant more power for the marabout whose outreach spread largely over the rural and peasant communities, which now had the opportunity to vote. Because of the &#x27;marabouts&#x27; far reaching influence in Senegal, politicians made a considerable effort to attain the support from these religious leaders for their personal advancement.

In order to attain their support in elections, bribes and material incentives were given to marabouts from political parties and potential candidates. Many believed that no party could hope to attain political power if the marabouts were completely opposed to it, and any party who rose to power had to comply with the Marabout&#x27;s demands or lose their political support.

In the 1962 power clash between now-President Senghor and Prime Minister Mamadou Dia, the Mourides again played a notable role. Dia was supported by Salafiyya-inspired urban Reform movements which opposed the Mourdides’ collaboration with the colonial system and maraboutic influence. In line with these concerns, Dia had previously opposed the marabouts’ political influence through a number of agricultural reforms. Mouride leaders’ support lay squarely with Senghor, and Dia could muster little popular support among the rural population who followed their marabouts’ loyalties. This unwavering support of Senghor continued until Fallilou Mbacké’s death in 1968, after which relations with the government cooled.

Support for the government returned with Senghor’s successor Adbou Diouf in 1980, who again allocated funds to infrastructure projects in Touba and afforded the city more autonomy. While the effects of this are contested, the Grand Marabout did issue a forceful njebbel in support of Diouf for the 1988 elections, according to which failure to vote for him amounted to betrayal of Cheick Amadou Bamba’s will. However, this move was unpopular with many Mourides, and later led to a retreat from national politics by the position of the Grand Marabout.

The public perception of Mourides’ involvement in the highest level of politics changed with the election of Abdoulaye Wade in 2000. A devout Mouride, Wade travelled to Touba the day after his election to seek the blessing of the Grand Marabout, Serigne Saliou Mbacké. Wade pledged financial support for the Mourides and included notable Mourides in his government, securing public support of notable Mourides – however not that of the Grand Marabout. This support allowed Wade to cultivate the Mourides as a solid bloc of support. 

The Party for Truth and Development, founded by Cheikh Ahmadou Kara Mbacké, a descendant of Cheick Amadou Bamba, marked the entry of an explicitly Mouride organisation into organised politics, with Kara reportedly also targeting a presidential run but being discouraged by his relatives.
===Economic influence===
Groundnuts are the third largest export from Senegal after fish and phosphates. The amount of groundnut crop which the Mourides produce has been estimated to range from one-third to three-quarters of Senegalese groundnut production, although others have now estimated it to equal around one-half of the national total of groundnuts produced. This partnership between the Brotherhood and the government stems from the French colonial administrators, who had viewed the production of groundnuts by the Mourides as a means of economic advantage through the increasing production of crops for export.
Due to this high proportion of groundnut crop produced by the Mouride, the brotherhood has always seemed to have a large influence in the groundnut market and the economy. Economic involvement is in fact encouraged by the religious leaders to their disciples through the use of ideology that places great value on the production labor which is performed in the service of God. Thus the Mourides devoted themselves to prayer and unpaid agricultural labor in service to their religious leaders. They cultivated the marabout&#x27;s fields for a decade, and then returned all land profits earned from the groundnut production. After ten years of dedicated work, laborers then received a share of land (large estates were divided up among the laborers). They continued to turn a share of their agricultural output over to their spiritual guide, as groundnut production was the community&#x27;s only means of sustenance.

The large share of the Mouride&#x27;s control over the groundnut production has placed them in the center of the nation&#x27;s economy. The government&#x27;s economic planners in turn have kept the brotherhood in their minds when establishing policies about groundnut production. Although the government places an importance on the Mouride cultivators, the disciples do not have efficient ways of cultivating groundnuts, and their techniques are often destructive to the land. Rather than looking out for the best use of the land, the Mouride cultivators are more interested in a fast payback. The methods used by the marabout have led to a constant depletion of the forests in Senegal and have taken much of the nutrients out of the soil. Government agencies have made attempts to help the marabout become more efficient in groundnut production, such as providing incentives for the workers to slow down their production.

Because of their emphasis on work, the Mouride brotherhood is economically well-established in parts of Africa, especially in Senegal and the Gambia. In Senegal, the brotherhood controls significant sections of the nation&#x27;s economy, for example the transportation sector and the peanut plantations. Ordinary followers donate part of their income to the Mouridiya.

===Cultural influence===

Islam is central to the political sociology of Senegal: the religious elite carry great weight in national politics; political discourse is replete with references and appeals to Islam. There is virtually no opposition to the principle of the secular state, socio-political cleavages based on religion, whether between Muslim and non-Muslim or between Sufi orders, are also virtually non-existent. Within Muslim discourse we find constant reference to such concepts as Islamic government, Islamic economics, or Islamic social order. The essential Islamic core lies in the shared belief in the fundamental unity of the Muslim world. The sense of belonging to a larger community, felt by many Muslims, is reinforced by the common use of Arabic as the language of prayer and religious learning.

Islam is a powerful mobilization instrument and provides the rhetoric for the formulation of ideological movements, and serves as a force for mobilizing people in the pursuit of goals defined by those movements. The role of local Islamic social structures, the nature of leadership and the relations between leaders and followers, the nature and sources of power and authority and the limits and constraints of the economy are all factors, which mediate and direct the impact of Islam on Politics. Senegalese elites have not found appeals to ethnic solidarity a productive means of building a mass following. Common religious affiliation has played a role in defusing the potential for tensions that arise from other social cleavages. There however remains a potential for ethnic and caste divides to enter the Senegalese socio-political organization.

The Senegalese have a mystical aspect to Islam, much like other Sufism brotherhoods. In Senegal, Islamic practice usually requires membership in religious brotherhoods that are dedicated to the marabouts of these groups. Marabouts are believed to be the mediators between Allah and the people. The people seek the help of marabouts for protection from the evil spirits, to improve one&#x27;s status (in terms of career, love or relationship, finances etc.), to obtain a cure or remedy for sickness, or even to curse an enemy. Marabouts are believed to have the ability to deal with the spirit world and seek the spirits’ help in things impossible for humans. The spirits’ help is sought since they are thought to be a source of much &quot;baraka&quot; &quot;blessings, divine grace&quot;.

The marabouts of the Mouride Brotherhood devote less time to study and teaching than other brotherhoods. They devote most of their time to ordering their disciples’ work and making amulets for their disciples&#x27; work and making amulets for their followers. Devout Mourides’ homes and workplaces are covered with pictures and sayings of their marabout, and they wear numerous amulets prepared by them. These acts are believed to bring them a better life and solve their problems as well. Even taxi and bus drivers fill their vehicles with stickers, paintings and photos of the marabouts of their particular brotherhoods.

The marabout-talibe relationship in Senegal is essentially a relationship of personal dependence. It can be a charismatic or a clientelistic relationship. In a charismatic relationship demonstrations of devotion and abnegation towards the marabouts can only explained because their talibes see them as intercessors or even intermediaries with god. This charismatic relationship is reinforced and complemented by a parallel clientelistic relationship between marabout and follower. The results is that marabouts are expected to provide certain material benefits to their follower in addition to the spiritual ones.

This patronage function has been important in the distribution of land, especially during periods of expanding peanut cultivation. Mouride social organization was developed in the context of the expanding peanut economy and its unique formulation was adapted to the economic imperatives of that context. The most distinctive institutional expression of Mouride agro-religious innovation is the daara, an agricultural community of young men in the service of a marabout. These collective farms were largely responsible for the expansion of peanut cultivation. A Mouride peasant may submit to a marabout&#x27;s organization of agricultural work because it is the best option available to him, independently of the ideology which supports it.

In contrast to a vision of masses blindly manipulated by a religious elite, the ties of talibes to their marabouts are frequently far more contingent and tenuous than assumed. As a result, marabouts confront the problem of recruiting and retaining followers. People at times confront a choice of which marabout to follow, the level of attachment to that marabout, and the domains or situations in which to follow him. While there is a widespread belief in the marabout system in Senegal and a strong commitment to it, it is not necessarily accompanied by an absolute attachment to any one living marabout.

===Influence outside Senegal===
The brotherhood has a sizable representation in certain large cities in Europe and the United States. Most of these cities with a large Senegalese immigrant population have a &quot;Keur Serigne Touba&quot; (Residence of the Master of Touba), a seat for the community which accommodates meetings and prayers while also being used as a provisional residence for newcomers. In Paris and New York City, a number of the Mouride followers are small-scale street merchants. They often send money back to the brotherhood leaders in Touba.

In 2004 Senegalese musician Youssou N&#x27;Dour released his Grammy Award winning album &quot;Egypt&quot;, which documents his Mouride beliefs and retells the story of Amadou Bamba and the Mouridiya. His intent was devotional, and the album was received that way in the West, but local some Mourides mistook &quot;Egypt&quot; for pop music using Islamic prayers, and initially expressed displeasure, which frustrated Youssou.

<doc id="100296" wikidata="Q782583" url="?curid=100296" title="Great White Fleet">
<text>The Great White Fleet was the popular nickname for the group of United States Navy battleships that completed a journey around the globe from 16 December 1907, to 22 February 1909, by order of President Theodore Roosevelt. It consisted of 16 battleships divided into two squadrons, along with various small escorts, and earned its moniker for the stark white paint on its hulls.

The fleet&#x27;s primary mission was to make friendly courtesy visits to numerous countries while displaying new U.S. naval power to the world; Roosevelt sought to demonstrate growing American military prowess and blue-water naval capabilities. Another goal was to deter a threatened war with Japan amid growing tensions around 1900. The voyage helped familiarize the 14,500 officers and sailors with the logistical and planning needs for extended fleet action far from home.

After long neglecting the Navy, Congress started generous appropriations in the late 1880s. Beginning with just 90 small ships, over one-third of them wooden and obsolete, the Navy quickly added new steel fighting vessels. The fleet&#x27;s capital ships were already obsolete compared to the British dreadnoughts in 1907. Nevertheless, it was by far the largest and most powerful fleet that had ever circled the globe; the mission was a success at home and in every country that was visited, including in Europe (which was visited only briefly).

==Background and purpose==

United States President Theodore Roosevelt dispatched 16 U.S. Navy battleships of the Atlantic Fleet on a worldwide voyage of circumnavigation from 16 December 1907 to 22 February 1909. The hulls were painted white, the Navy&#x27;s peacetime color scheme, and decorated with gilded scrollwork with a red, white, and blue banner on their bows. The superstructures were painted buff. These ships later came to be known as the Great White Fleet.

The purpose of the fleet deployment was multifaceted. Ostensibly, it served as a showpiece of American goodwill, as the fleet visited numerous countries and harbors. In this, the voyage was not unprecedented. Naval courtesy calls, many times in conjunction with the birthdays of various monarchs and other foreign celebrations, had become common in the 19th century. Port calls showcased pomp, ceremony, and militarism during a period of rising prewar nationalism. In 1891, a large French fleet visited Kronstadt, Russia, in conjunction with negotiations between the two nations. Although France and Russia had been hostile to each other for at least three decades prior, the significance of the call was not lost on Russia, and Tsar Nicholas II signed a treaty of alliance with France in 1894. As navies grew larger, naval pageants grew longer, more elaborate, and more frequent. The United States began participating in these events in 1902, when Roosevelt invited Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany to send a squadron for a courtesy call to New York City. Invitations for U.S. Navy ships to participate in fleet celebrations in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany followed.

Additionally, the voyage of the Great White Fleet demonstrated both at home and on the world stage that the U.S. had become a major sea power in the years after its triumph in the Spanish–American War, with possessions that included Guam, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico. This was not the first demonstration of U.S. naval power; during the Algeciras Conference in 1906, which was convened to settle a diplomatic crisis between France and Germany over the fate of Morocco, Roosevelt had ordered eight battleships to maintain a presence in the Mediterranean Sea. Since Japan had arisen as a major sea power with the 1905 annihilation of the Russian fleet at Tsushima, the deployment of the Great White Fleet was therefore intended, at least in part, to send a message to Tokyo that the American fleet could be deployed anywhere, even from its Atlantic ports, and would be able to defend American interests in the Philippines and the Pacific.

The most serious tensions between the United States and Japan came in 1907, leading to widespread speculation among experts that war was imminent between the two. The main cause was intense Japanese resentment against the mistreatment of Japanese in California. Pulitzer prize-winning biographer Henry Pringle states that sending Great White Fleet so dramatically to Japan in 1908 was, &quot;the direct result of the Japanese trouble.&quot; Tensions rapidly de-escalated after the fleet&#x27;s very friendly reception in Yokohama. Thus, the gesture neutralized the diplomatic trouble that had resulted from anti-Japanese riots in San Francisco. Those problems had been resolved by the Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement of 1907 and the fleet visit was a friendly gesture to Japan. The Japanese welcomed it. Roosevelt saw the deployment as one that would encourage patriotism, and give the impression that he would teach Japan &quot;a lesson in polite behavior&quot;, as historian Robert A. Hart phrased it. After the fleet had crossed the Pacific, Japanese statesmen realized that the balance of power in the East had changed.

The voyage also provided an opportunity to improve the sea- and battle-worthiness of the fleet. While earlier capital-ship classes such as the , and were designed primarily for coastal defense, later classes such as the and incorporated lessons learned from the Spanish–American War and were conceived as ships with &quot;the highest practicable speed and the greatest radius of action&quot;, in the words of the appropriation bills approved by the United States Congress for their construction. They were intended as modern warships capable of long-range operations. Nevertheless, the experience gained in the recent war with Spain had been limited.

==Concerns and preparations==
Roosevelt&#x27;s stated intent was to give the Navy practice in navigation, communication, coal consumption, and fleet maneuvering; Navy professionals maintained, however, that such matters could be served better in home waters. In light of what had happened to the Russian Baltic Fleet, they were concerned about sending their own fleet on a long deployment, especially since part of the intent was to impress a modern, battle-tested navy that had not known defeat. The fleet was untested in making such a voyage, and Tsushima had proven that extended deployments had no place in practical strategy. The Japanese Navy was close to coaling and repair facilities; while American ships could coal in the Philippines, docking facilities were far from optimal. An extended stop on the West Coast of the United States during the voyage for overhaul and refurbishment in dry dock would be a necessity. Planning for the voyage, however, showed a dearth of adequate facilities there, as well. The main sea channel of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard near San Francisco was too shallow for battleships, which left only the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton, Washington, for refit and repair. The Hunter&#x27;s Point civilian yard in San Francisco could accommodate capital ships, but had been closed due to lack of use and was slated for demolition. President Roosevelt ordered that Hunter&#x27;s Point be reopened, facilities be brought up to date, and the fleet to report there.

Also, the question of adequate resources for coaling existed. This was not an issue when the Atlantic Fleet cruised the Atlantic or Caribbean, as fuel supplies were readily available. However, the United States did not enjoy a worldwide network of coaling stations like that of Great Britain, nor did it have an adequate supply of auxiliary vessels for resupply. During the Spanish–American War, this lack had forced Admiral George Dewey to buy a collier-load of British coal in Hong Kong before the Battle of Manila Bay to ensure his squadron would not run out of steam at sea. The need had been even more pressing for the Russian Baltic Fleet during its long deployment during the Russo-Japanese War, not just for the distance it was to steam, but also because, as a belligerent nation in wartime, most neutral ports were closed to it due to international law. While the lack of support vessels was pointed out and a vigorous program of building such ships suggested by Rear Admiral George W. Melville, who had served as chief of the Bureau of Equipment, his words were not heeded adequately until World War II.

Federal regulations that restricted supply vessels for Navy ships to those flying the United States flag, complicated by the lack of an adequate United States Merchant Marine, proved another obstacle. Roosevelt initially offered to award Navy supply contracts to American skippers whose bids exceeded those of foreign captains by less than 50%. Many carriers declined this offer because they could not obtain enough cargo to cover the cost of the return trip. Two months before the fleet sailed, Roosevelt ordered the Navy Department to contract 38 ships to supply the fleet with the 125,000 tons of coal it would need to steam from Hampton Roads, Virginia, to San Francisco. Only eight of these were American-registered; most of the other 30 were of British registry. This development was potentially awkward, since part of the mission was to impress Japan with the perception of overwhelming American naval power. Britain had become a military ally of Japan in 1902 with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, which obliged it to aid Japan should a foreign power declare war against it. Technically, the list of potential combatants included the United States. The British government decided to play both sides of the political fence with the intent of moderating any Japanese-American friction that might arise.

Prior to the ships’ departure, Congress raised concerns about funding. According to the Naval Historical Center, Maine Senator Eugene Hale made his intention known to withhold funding for the effort. The President&#x27;s response was that if Congress was unwilling to fund the trip, he already had the funds to send the fleet out into the Pacific. If Congress wanted the fleet to return home, though, they would have to fund the other half of the trip. As noted by Roosevelt biographer Edmund Morris, the President would not be deterred. He stated &quot;I am Commander-in-Chief, and my decision is absolute in the matter.&quot;

==Voyage==


As the Panama Canal was not yet complete, the fleet had to pass through the Straits of Magellan. The scope of such an operation was unprecedented in U.S. history, as ships had to sail from all points of the compass to rendezvous points and proceed according to a carefully orchestrated, well-conceived plan. It involved almost the entire operational capability of the U.S. Navy. During the crossing of the Straits of Magellan, the U.S. ships were escorted by the Chilean Navy cruiser, &quot;Chacabuco&quot;.

Unlike the formidable obstacles that had faced the Russian fleet on its voyage from the Baltic to the Pacific, which eventually led to its destruction by the Japanese in 1905, the U.S. effort benefited from a peaceful environment, which aided the coordination of ship movements.

After taking nearly four months to round South America, the fleet made several stops in American waters on the Pacific Ocean. In port after port, thousands of citizens turned out to see and greet the fleet. In April 1908, 16 battleships anchored off of Coronado, California, in the San Diego area, and thousands of sailors and marines took part in a parade through San Diego&#x27;s streets. The fleet also stopped in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. In May 1908, the fleet visited Monterey, California; the nearby Hotel Del Monte in Del Monte, California, hosted a grand ball for the officers of the fleet. After arriving in San Francisco on 6 May, most of the fleet took a side trip to Seattle and Tacoma, then returned to San Francisco.

On 7 July, the entire fleet left San Francisco for Honolulu, New Zealand, and Australia. In Australia, the arrival of the Great White Fleet on 20 August 1908 was used to encourage support for the forming of Australia&#x27;s own navy. In Sicily, sailors helped in recovery operations after the 1908 Messina earthquake.

==Fleet composition==
The 14-month-long voyage was intended to be a grand pageant of American naval power. The squadrons were manned by 14,000 sailors. They covered some and made 20 port calls on six continents. The fleet was impressive, especially as a demonstration of American industrial prowess (all 18 ships had been constructed since the Spanish–American War), but already the battleships represented the suddenly outdated predreadnought type of capital ship, as the first battleships of the revolutionary had just entered service, and the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first dreadnought, , was already fitting out. The two oldest ships in the fleet, and , were already obsolete and unfit for battle; two others, and , had to be detached at San Francisco because of mechanical troubles and were replaced by the and the . After repairs, &quot;Alabama&quot; and &quot;Maine&quot; completed their &quot;own, more direct, circumnavigation of the globe&quot; via Honolulu, Guam, Manila, Singapore, Colombo, Suez, Naples, Gibraltar, the Azores, and finally back to the United States, arriving on 20 October 1908, four months before the remainder of the fleet, which had taken a more circuitous route.

The battleships were accompanied during the first leg of their voyage by a &quot;Torpedo Flotilla&quot; of six early destroyers, and by several auxiliary ships. The destroyers and their tender did not actually steam in company with the battleships, but followed their own itinerary from Hampton Roads to San Francisco, California. Also, the armored cruiser preceded the fleet itinerary for its first and second legs by about a month, perhaps making arrangements to later receive the fleet.

==General fleet itinerary==


With as flagship under the command of Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans, the fleet sailed from Hampton Roads on 16 December 1907 for Trinidad, British West Indies, thence to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Punta Arenas, Chile; Callao, Peru; Magdalena Bay, Mexico, and north along the West Coast, arriving at San Francisco on 6 May 1908.

At San Francisco, Rear Admiral Charles S. Sperry assumed command of the fleet, owing to the poor health of Admiral Evans. Also at San Francisco, the squadrons were slightly rearranged, bringing the newest and best ships in the fleet up to the First Squadron. was detached and later became the supply ship of the Pacific Fleet. At this time also, &quot;Nebraska&quot;, under Captain Reginald F. Nicholson, and &quot;Wisconsin&quot;, under Captain Frank E. Beatty, were substituted for &quot;Maine&quot; and &quot;Alabama&quot;. In San Francisco, was brought forward into First Squadron, First Division, and took her place as flagship, Second Squadron.

Leaving that port on 7 July 1908 the U.S. Atlantic Fleet visited Honolulu; Auckland, New Zealand; Sydney, Melbourne, and Albany, Australia; Manila, Philippines; Yokohama, Japan; and Colombo, Ceylon; then arriving at Suez, Egypt, on 3 January 1909.

While the fleet was in Egypt, word was received of an earthquake in Sicily, thus affording an opportunity for the United States to show its friendship to Italy by offering aid to its victims. &quot;Connecticut&quot;, , , and were dispatched to Messina, Italy, at once. The crew of &quot;Illinois&quot; recovered the bodies of the American consul, Arthur S. Cheney, and his wife, entombed in the ruins. , the fleet&#x27;s station ship at Constantinople, and , a refrigerator ship fitted out in New York, were hurried to Messina, relieving &quot;Connecticut&quot; and &quot;Illinois&quot;, so that they could continue on the cruise.

Leaving Messina on 9 January 1909, the fleet stopped at Naples, Italy, thence to Gibraltar, arriving at Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909. There, President Roosevelt reviewed the fleet as it passed into the roadstead.

===Itinerary===

==Experience gained==
The cruise of the Great White Fleet provided practical experience for US naval personnel in sea duty and ship handling. It also showed the viability of US warships for long-range operations as no major mechanical mishaps occurred. However, while the cruise uncovered design flaws, it did not test the abilities to engage in battle fleet action. These included excessive draft, low armor belts, large turret openings and exposed ammunition hoists. In fact, the success of the deployment might have helped obscure design deficiencies that were not addressed until World War I.

According to Mark Albertson: Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s battleships captured the imagination of the world. The cruise proved an immense public relation success for the Navy. Relations were fostered with nations that hitherto had been little more than names on a map; while relations with the familiar capitals were enhanced. The cruise highlighted such deficiencies in American battleship design as the placement of armor and ammunition hoists. The lack of American logistical support was also laid bare, ramming home the lesson that without an adequate homegrown merchant marine, control of the seas was all but impossible...It demonstrated America&#x27;s ability to transfer power from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific. Valuable lessons learned in the projection of sea power would later pay handsome dividends in two global conflicts. But of greater importance is that Roosevelt&#x27;s gambit elevated the United States to the ranks of a global powers. 

&quot;The Times&quot; of London editorialized regarding the extremely enthusiastic reception in Australia: &quot;A spectacular display has valuable uses in impressing the masses, who will remember the sight for years, and draw important political deductions therefrom.&quot;

==Effects on US capital ship design==
The was laid down in 1906 and entered service in 1910 as the first American dreadnought. It was coal fired. While the capital ships of the Great White Fleet were already obsolete in light of the &quot;big gun&quot; revolution ushered in by the construction of , their behavior at sea furnished valuable information that affected future construction. For instance, in terms of seaworthiness, all the capital ships in the fleet proved wet in all but the calmest seas, which led to the flared bows of subsequent U.S. battleships, increased freeboard forward and such spray-reducing measures as the elimination of billboards for anchors and gun sponsons. Increased freeboard was needed; this and related considerations demanded increases in beam and overall size. Between the s, the last American capital ships completed before data from the cruise became available, and the , the first designed after this data was received, displacement (and, as a result, cost) per ship increased by one third.

Deficiencies in seaworthiness in turn reduced the battle-worthiness of the fleet. Turret heights for main armament proved too low and needed to be raised. Secondary armament was useless at speed and especially in tradewind conditions (with the wind moving over the sea at or greater) and needed to be moved much higher in the hull. Improved placement began with the &quot;Wyoming&quot;-class battleships and was further refined in the . Casemates for the bow 3-inch guns in the newer pre-dreadnoughts were untenable due to wetness and were removed. Another discovery was that, even when fully loaded, the bottom of the battleships&#x27; side armor was visible—and the ships thus vulnerable to shells that might hit beneath it to reach their machinery and magazines—in smooth to moderate seas. The profile of crests and troughs in some ships contributed to this problem. Admiral Evans concluded that the standard width of belt armor was inadequate.

One other necessity the cruise outlined was the need for tactical homogeneity. Before the cruise, critics such as then-Captain William Sims (to whom President Roosevelt listened) had argued that American warship design had remained too conservative and precluded the level of efficiency needed for the fleet to function as an effective unit. The cruise proved the charge true. This would eventually lead to the building of standard-type battleships in the U.S. Navy. When President Roosevelt convened the 1908 Newport Conference of the Naval War College, he placed responsibility for U.S. battleship design on the General Board of the United States Navy. This gave line officers and planners direct input and control over warship design, a pattern which has persisted to the present day.

==Effects on fleet operations==
Experience gained by the cruise led to improvements in formation steaming, coal economy and morale. Gunnery exercises doubled the fleet&#x27;s accuracy. However, the mission also underlined the fleet&#x27;s dependence on foreign colliers and the need for coaling stations and auxiliary ships for resupply.

<doc id="100301" wikidata="Q2267970" url="?curid=100301" title="Miss Piggy">
<text>Miss Piggy is a Muppet character known for her breakout role in the sketch comedy television series &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. She is notable for her temperamental diva superstar personality, her tendency to use French phrases in her speech, and practicing karate. The character is also known for her on-again/off-again relationship with Kermit the Frog which never ends permanently. Frank Oz performed the character from 1976 to 2002 and was succeeded by Eric Jacobson in 2001.

Since her debut in 1974, Miss Piggy has been a celebrity fixture in international pop culture, with a distinguished career in film, television, fashion, recording, and publishing. She has been widely identified as a feminist icon. In 1996, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked her number 23 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list. In a 2001 Channel 4 poll in the UK, Miss Piggy was ranked 29th on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. In 1996, a cook book entitled &quot;In the Kitchen With Miss Piggy: Fabulous Recipes from My Famous Celebrity Friends by Moi&quot; was released. In 2015, she was honored by the Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art for her achievements and contributions to breaking gender roles in the entertainment industry.

A Lady Liberty-inspired Miss Piggy statue stands as the centerpiece of a fountain in front of Rizzo the Rat&#x27;s PizzeRizzo restaurant at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios. Miss Piggy has a collective star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame as a member of the Muppets, which they received on March 20, 2012 in the category of Motion Pictures. The star is located at 6834 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Characterization==
===Origins and description===
In a 1979 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, performer Frank Oz outlined Piggy&#x27;s biography: &quot;She grew up in a small town (most likely Keystone, Iowa); her father died when she was young and her mother wasn&#x27;t that nice to her. She had to enter beauty contests to survive. She has a lot of vulnerability which she has to hide, because of her need to be a superstar&quot;. During development of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, Oz assigned a hook for each Muppet he performed; Miss Piggy&#x27;s hook was a &quot;truck driver wanting to be a woman&quot;. Oz has also stated that while Fozzie Bear is a two-dimensional character and Animal has no dimensions, Miss Piggy is one of the few Muppet characters to be fully realized in three dimensions.

Piggy, truly a diva in a class of her own, is convinced she is destined for stardom, and nothing will stand in her way. She has a capricious nature, at times determined to (and often succeeding in) conveying an image of feminine charm, but suddenly flying into a violent rage (accompanied by her trademark karate chop and &quot;hi-yah!&quot;) whenever she thinks someone has insulted or thwarted her. Kermit the Frog has learned this all too well; when she is not smothering him in kisses, she is sending him flying through the air with a karate chop.

She loves wearing long gloves; Hildegarde, who used to wear them, once said, &quot;Miss Piggy stole the gloves idea from me”. Miss Piggy was also inspired by jazz singer Peggy Lee.

===Relationship with Kermit===

Since the debut of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, the romantic relationship between Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog has been subject to substantial coverage and commentary by the media. Throughout &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;&#x27;s run, Miss Piggy&#x27;s romantic pursuit for Kermit was consistently expressed. Kermit, however, constantly rebuffed Piggy&#x27;s feelings. Eventually, in the films, Kermit began returning her affections and even (unwittingly) marries her in &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;. However, subsequent events suggest that the marriage was simply fictional. It is mentioned by Miss Piggy, however, in &quot;The Muppets: A Celebration of 30 Years&quot; (1986) that Kermit was a happily married frog. This marriage isn&#x27;t referenced in &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot;.

Miss Piggy and Kermit formally ended their romantic relationship on May 10, 1990. The decision was made by Jim Henson Productions and a publicity campaign titled &quot;The Pig of the Nineties&quot; was scheduled to follow. An autobiography of Piggy was expected to be published as part of the effort. However, shortly after the announcement on May 16, Jim Henson died and the campaign was dropped altogether. The two eventually resumed their relationship.

In 2015, Miss Piggy and Kermit ended their romantic relationship for a second time.

===Performers===
Frank Oz was Miss Piggy&#x27;s principal performer from her early appearances on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; until his departure from the cast in 2000; his last known performance as Piggy was an appearance on &quot;The Today Show&quot;. Oz&#x27;s earliest known performance as Piggy was actually in a 1974 appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Richard Hunt occasionally performed Miss Piggy during the first season of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, alternating with Oz. In 2002, Eric Jacobson was cast as the new performer of Miss Piggy, and his first public debut as the character was performed via satellite at the 2001 &quot;MuppetFest&quot;. Jacobson has remained Piggy&#x27;s principal performer since then, openly describing the role as &quot;one of the most famous drag acts in the business.&quot;

During Oz&#x27;s tenure as the character, other performers would step in. Jerry Nelson performed Piggy in 1974 for a brief appearance on &quot;Herb Alpert &amp; the Tijuana Brass&quot;. Fran Brill performed Piggy for &quot;The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence&quot;, a pilot for &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. Kevin Clash and Peter Linz puppeteered Piggy for most of the filming of &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;Muppets from Space&quot;, respectively, with Oz dubbing Piggy&#x27;s voice in post-production. Victor Yerrid briefly performed Piggy in &quot;Muppets Ahoy!&quot;, a 2006 stage show for the Disney Cruise Line. In &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;, Piggy&#x27;s voice was provided by voice actress Laurie O&#x27;Brien. Voice actor Hal Rayle provided her voice for a short-lived spin-off series, &quot;Little Muppet Monsters&quot;. Melanie Harrison voices Baby Piggy on the 2018 reboot of &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;.

==History==
The first known appearance of Miss Piggy was on the Herb Alpert television special &quot;Herb Alpert and the TJB&quot;, broadcast on October 13, 1974, on ABC. Miss Piggy&#x27;s voice was noticeably more demure and soft, singing with Herb, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything but Love.&quot; The first draft of the puppet was an unnamed blonde, beady-eyed pig who appeared briefly in the 1975 pilot special &quot;The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence&quot;, in a sketch called &quot;Return to Beneath the Planet of the Pigs.&quot; She was unnamed in that show, but by the time &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; began in 1976, she had assumed something resembling her classic look—a pig with large blue eyes, a flowing silver gown, satin white long gloves, blue sheer shawl, and a hopelessly romantic persona.

===&quot;The Muppet Show&quot;===
Miss Piggy began as a minor chorus pig on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; but gradually developed into one of the central characters of the series, as the writers and producers of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; recognized that a lovelorn pig could be more than a one-note running gag. She spawned a huge fad during the late 1970s and early 1980s and eclipsed Kermit and the other Muppets in popularity at that time, selling far more merchandise and writing a book entitled &quot;Miss Piggy&#x27;s Guide to Life&quot; that, unlike any of Kermit&#x27;s books, wound up on top of the &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller List.

===Films and television series===
Miss Piggy has appeared in all the Muppet films and television series following &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. In &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; (1979), she has just won a beauty contest when she first meets Kermit and joins the Muppets. In &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; (1981), Miss Piggy plays an aspiring fashion model who gets caught up in a screwball-comedy misunderstanding involving a gang of jewel thieves. 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; ends with a climactic wedding between Kermit and Miss Piggy. In 1992&#x27;s &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot;, Miss Piggy plays Mrs. Cratchit to Kermit&#x27;s Bob Cratchit. Miss Piggy takes on the gender-flipped role of Benjamina Gunn in &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot; (1996), and she plays an eager news reporter in &quot;Muppets From Space&quot; (1999).

In &quot;The Muppets&quot; (2011), Miss Piggy is shown to be residing in Paris, having become the plus-size editor for &quot;Vogue&quot; after the Muppets disbanded, and after she left Kermit in Los Angeles. In &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot; (2014), having rejoined the Muppets on a global tour, she nearly marries Constantine in London, after he poses as Kermit. 

In the TV series &quot;The Muppets&quot;, Miss Piggy hosts the late-night talk show &quot;Up Late with Miss Piggy&quot;.

In the 2020 Disney+ series, &quot;Muppets Now&quot;, Miss Piggy hosted a segment called &quot;Lifesty(le) with Miss Piggy&quot;.

===Other appearances===
Miss Piggy has made multiple appearances in various Academy Awards ceremonies. In 1980, Miss Piggy and Johnny Carson introduced the performance of Best Original Song nominee &quot;Rainbow Connection&quot; from &quot;The Muppet Movie.&quot; In 1982, Miss Piggy and Kermit performed the nominated song, &quot;The First Time It Happens&quot; from &quot;The Great Muppet Caper,&quot; during the 54th Academy Awards

Miss Piggy had a spoof luxury brand featured on QVC, &quot;Moi by Miss Piggy&quot;. The name had previously been used by a perfume released in 1998. She also appeared as a presenter at the 68th and 84th Academy Awards, in 1996 and 2012, respectively.

On Friday, March 15, 2013, Miss Piggy appeared on the UK telethon Comic Relief to reveal the cash total and introduce boy band One Direction. She was in Dream House 2013. On December 6, 2013, she performed &#x27;Somethin&#x27; Stupid&#x27; alongside Robbie Williams at the London Palladium. In 2015, Miss Piggy received a Sackler Center First Award from the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. An essay was subsequently released by The Muppets Studio (in the guise of Miss Piggy) for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, titled &quot;Why I Am a Feminist Pig&quot;, explaining why she deserved the award.

On May 7, 2023, Miss Piggy and Kermit were invited to the Coronation Concert of King Charles III. She flirted with the host Hugh Bonneville.

She was interviewed by Michelle Miller on CBS Saturday Morning on May 25, 2024.

<text>In mathematics and abstract algebra, &quot;group theory&quot; studies the algebraic structures known as groups. The concept of a group is central to abstract algebra: other well-known algebraic structures, such as rings, fields, and vector spaces, can all be seen as groups endowed with additional operations and axioms. Groups recur throughout mathematics, and the methods of group theory have influenced many parts of algebra. Linear algebraic groups and Lie groups are two branches of group theory that have experienced advances and have become subject areas in their own right.

Various physical systems, such as crystals and the hydrogen atom, may be modelled by symmetry groups. Thus group theory and the closely related representation theory have many important applications in physics, chemistry, and materials science. Group theory is also central to public key cryptography.

<text>This is a list of Sufi orders (Tariqas) in Senegal and the Gambia. They are active Muslim organizations that can also be found in many other parts of Africa and the Islamic world. Their members are mainly Wolofs, Fulas and Tocouleurs.

==List==
The four largest Muslim brotherhoods in Senegal are:

* The Xaadir (Qādiriyya), the oldest, founded in Baghdad by the Sufi mystic Abdul Qādir al-Jilānī in the 12th century, now pan-Islamic, spread to Senegal in the 18th century.
* The Tijaniyyah, the largest in membership, founded in Fez, Morocco by the Algerian born Cheikh Sīdī &#x27;Aḥmad at-Tijānī. The order is centered in the city of Tivaouane.
* The Mourides, the richest and most active, founded by the Islamic leader Cheikh Amadou Bamba (1850–1927) of French West Africa, now Senegal. The order is centered in the city of Touba.
* The Layene are a smaller Sufi order, centered at Yoff north of Dakar.

<doc id="100314" wikidata="Q194437" url="?curid=100314" title="Ṛta">
<text>In the Vedic religion, Ṛta (/ɹ̩t̪ɐ/; Sanskrit &quot;&quot; &quot;order, rhythm, rule; truth; logos&quot;) is the principle of natural order which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it. In the hymns of the Vedas, &quot;Ṛta&quot; is described as that which is ultimately responsible for the proper functioning of the natural, moral and sacrificial orders. Conceptually, it is closely allied to the injunctions and ordinances thought to uphold it, collectively referred to as &quot;Dharma&quot;, and the action of the individual in relation to those ordinances, referred to as &quot;Karma&quot; – two terms which eventually eclipsed &quot;Ṛta&quot; in importance as signifying natural, religious and moral order in later Hinduism. Sanskrit scholar Maurice Bloomfield referred to &quot;Ṛta&quot; as &quot;one of the most important religious conceptions of the Rigveda&quot;, going on to note that, &quot;from the point of view of the history of religious ideas we may, in fact we must, begin the history of Hindu religion at least with the history of this conception&quot;.

==Etymology==
Vedic and its Avestan equivalent &quot;&quot; both derive from Proto-Indo-Iranian &quot;truth&quot;, which in turn continues Proto-Indo-European &quot;*&quot; &quot;properly joined, right, true&quot;, from a presumed root &quot;*&quot;, making it a distant cognate of Latin &quot;ordo&quot; and thus English &quot;order.&quot;
The derivative noun &quot;ṛta&quot; is defined as &quot;fixed or settled order, rule, divine law or truth&quot;. 

As Mahony (1998) notes the term can be translated as &quot;that which has moved in a fitting manner&quot;. Although this meaning is not actually cited by authoritative Sanskrit dictionaries it is a regular derivation from the verbal root ṛ, &quot;to move&quot; with ta, the suffix which forms the past participle, so it can be regarded as the putative origin of the word. More abstractly, it is translated as &quot;universal law&quot; or &quot;cosmic order&quot;, or simply as &quot;truth&quot;. The latter meaning dominates in the Avestan cognate to &quot;Ṛta&quot;, &quot;aṣ̌a&quot;.

The proper Sanskrit pronunciation of the word is ṛta, the ṛ being a vocalic r, like that in pert or dirt, when pronounced with a rhotic r, e.g. as in American, followed by a short a. The most common pronunciation of speakers of modern Indian languages is &quot;rita&quot;, with short i and short a, due to the loss of the vocalic r by the successor languages to Sanskrit, the prakrits and modern Indo-Aryan languages.

The term appears in Vedic texts and in post-Vedic texts, both as Ṛta and derivatives of the term. For example, in the 2nd-century BCE text &quot;Mahābhāṣya&quot; of Patanjali, he explains &quot;Ṛtaka&quot; to be the grammatically correct form of name for a son, where then the name would mean &quot;truthling&quot;.

==Origins==

In scholarship there is no common position about the origin of the concept of &quot;Ṛta&quot;. Similar concepts exist in many Indo-European cultures and the names can in addition be derived from an identical root word &quot;*&quot;. This is why some scholars take the position that the concepts in the Indo-European daughter cultures have a common ancestor in the Proto-Indo-European culture.

In contrast Hermann Oldenberg (1894) surmised that the concept of &quot;Ṛta&quot; originally arose in the Indo-Aryan period from a consideration of the natural order of the world and of the occurrences taking place within it as doing so with a kind of causal necessity. Both Vedic &quot;Ṛta&quot; and Avestan &quot;aša&quot; were conceived of as having a tripartite function which manifested itself in the physical, ethical and ritual domains. In the context of Vedic religion, those features of nature which either remain constant or which occur on a regular basis were seen to be a manifestation of the power of &quot;Ṛta&quot; in the physical cosmos. In the human sphere, &quot;Ṛta&quot; was understood to manifest itself as the imperative force behind both the moral order of society as well as the correct performance of Vedic rituals. The notion of a universal principle of natural order is by no means unique to the Vedas, and &quot;Ṛta&quot; has been compared to similar ideas in other cultures, such as Ma&#x27;at in Ancient Egyptian religion, Moira and the Logos in Greek paganism, and the Dao.

Due to the nature of Vedic Sanskrit, a term such as &quot;Ṛta&quot; can be used to indicate numerous things, either directly or indirectly, and both Indian and European scholars have experienced difficulty in arriving at fitting interpretations for &quot;Ṛta&quot; in all of its various usages in the Vedas, though the underlying sense of &quot;ordered action&quot; remains universally evident. In the Rigveda, the term &quot;Ṛta&quot; appears as many as 390 times, and has been characterized as &quot;the one concept which pervades the whole of Ṛgvedic thought&quot;. The cosmic order, &quot;Ṛta&quot;, has three features:
* &quot;Gati&quot;, the continuous movement or change.
* &quot;Samghatna&quot;, a system based on interdependent parts.
* &quot;Niyati&quot;, an inherent order of interdependence and movement.

&quot;Ṛta&quot; appears most frequently as representing abstract concepts such as &quot;law&quot;, &quot;commandment&quot;, &quot;order&quot;, &quot;sacrifice&quot;, &quot;truth&quot;, and &quot;regularity&quot;, but also occasionally as physical phenomena such as the waters, the heavens or the sun as manifestations of the operation of &quot;Ṛta&quot;. &quot;Ṛta&quot; is also frequently used in reference to various Vedic deities. Thus, Bṛhaspati is referred to as possessing a powerful bow with &quot;&quot;Ṛta&quot; as its string&quot; and as one prepared to &quot;mount the chariot of &quot;Ṛta&quot;&quot;; Agni is described as one who is &quot;desirous of &quot;Ṛta&quot;, one who is &quot;Ṛta&quot;-minded&quot; and as he who &quot;spread Heaven and Earth by &quot;Ṛta&quot;&quot;; the Maruts are referred to as &quot;rejoicing in the house of &quot;Ṛta&quot;&quot; and as &quot;knowers of &quot;Ṛta&quot;&quot;; Ushas is described as having been &quot;placed at the root of &quot;Ṛta&quot;&quot;; Varuna is praised as &quot;having the form of &quot;Ṛta&quot;&quot; and, along with Mitra as Mitra-Varuna, as &quot;destroying the foes by &quot;Ṛta&quot;&quot; and as &quot;professing &quot;Ṛta&quot; by &quot;Ṛta&quot;&quot;. Epithets such as &quot;born of &quot;Ṛta&quot;&quot; and &quot;protector of &quot;Ṛta&quot;&quot; are frequently applied to numerous divinities, as well as to the sacrificial fire and the sacrifice itself.

Despite the abundance of such references, the gods are never portrayed as having command over &quot;Ṛta&quot;. Instead, the gods, like all created beings, remain subject to &quot;Ṛta&quot;, and their divinity largely resides in their serving it in the role of executors, agents or instruments of its manifestation. As Day (1982) notes, the gods &quot;do not govern &quot;Ṛta&quot; so much as immanentalize it through the particularities of divine ordinances and retributions concerning both rewards and punishments. In this sense they do not &quot;govern&quot; &quot;Ṛta&quot;; they serve it as agents and ministers&quot;.

===Varuna===

While the concept of &quot;Ṛta&quot; as an abstract, universal principle generally remained resistant to the anthropomorphic tendencies of the Vedic period, it became increasingly associated with the actions of individual deities, in particular with those of the god Varuna as the omniscient, all-encompassing sky. Although the Adityas as a group are associated with &quot;Ṛta&quot;, being referred to as &quot;the charioteers of &quot;Ṛta&quot;, dwelling in the home of &quot;Ṛta&quot;&quot;, it is Varuna in particular who is identified as the &quot;friend of &quot;Ṛta&quot;&quot;. The connection of Varuna and &quot;Ṛta&quot; extended beyond the physical realm and into the sphere of ritual worship, with the sacrificial fire itself being lauded as that which &quot;harnesses the steeds and holds the reins of &quot;Ṛta&quot;, becoming Varuna when he strives for &quot;Ṛta&quot;&quot;. As James (1969) notes, Varuna attained the position of &quot;universal Power &quot;par excellence&quot; maintaining &quot;Ṛta&quot;&quot; and is celebrated as having &quot;separated and established heaven and earth, spreading them out as the upper and lower firmaments, himself enthroned above them as the universal king, ordering the immutable moral law, exercising his rule by the sovereignty of &quot;Ṛta&quot;.

==&quot;Dharma&quot;==
Already in the earliest Vedic texts, &quot;Ṛta&quot; as an ethical principle is linked with the notion of cosmic retribution. A central concept of the Ṛgveda is that created beings fulfil their true natures when they follow the path set for them by the ordinances of &quot;Ṛta&quot;, and failing to follow those ordinances was thought to be responsible for the appearance of various forms of calamity and suffering. Committing one&#x27;s actions to the governance of &quot;Ṛta&quot;, referred to as its &quot;Dharma&quot;, was therefore understood as imperative in ensuring one&#x27;s own well-being. In this vein, the individual who follows the ordinances of nature can be described as one who acts according to the &quot;&quot;Dharma&quot; of &quot;Ṛta&quot;&quot;. &quot;Dharma&quot;, then, was originally conceived of as a &quot;finite or particularized manifestation of &quot;Ṛta&quot; inasmuch as it represents that aspect of the universal Order which specifically concerns the mundane natural, religious, social and moral spheres as expressed in ritualistic regulations, public laws, moral principles and laws of nature&quot;.

Though originally understood as a subordinate component of the essentially metaphysical concept of &quot;Ṛta&quot;, &quot;Dharma&quot; eventually grew to overshadow &quot;Ṛta&quot; in prominence in later Vedic and early Hindu literature. According to Day (1982), the concept of &quot;Dharma&quot;, ...became so useful for framing religious, moral and social regulations, that interest in it and discussion of its applications to social and moral order eclipsed all discussions of metaphysical and theological ideas. Since, moreover, &quot;Dharma&quot; was made the central subject of a literary tradition which was to become vast and extensive throughout India, while the conception of &quot;Ṛta&quot; remained largely confined to the Vedas and their commentaries, it naturally took possession of brāhmaṇical thinking even at the expense of older, exalted concepts and conceptions.

==&quot;Karma&quot;==
As the notion of &quot;Dharma&quot; shifted emphasis away from the gods as executors of &quot;Ṛta&quot; and towards the individual as upholding &quot;Ṛta&quot; through their actions, the ethical responsibility and culpability of the individual received an increasing amount of emphasis towards the end of the Vedic period. Central to the discussion of such culpability is the notion of &quot;Karma&quot;. &quot;Karma&quot; (lit. &quot;action&quot;) refers to the works one performs, which can occur either in congruence with or in opposition to &quot;Dharma&quot; – and thus, to &quot;Ṛta&quot; – and which are posited to stand in a causal relationship to the pains and pleasures one experiences in life.

The emergence of &quot;Karma&quot; as a central doctrine of the late Vedic and early Hindu tradition is due in part to the problem of theodicy. Given the inherent goodness of &quot;Ṛta&quot; and its absolute power over the operation of the universe, the presence of gross inequality and injustice in the world represented a serious religious, philosophical and ethical dilemma. The notion of &quot;Karma&quot; helped to overcome this problem as it was conceived as a &quot;law of moral causation&quot; which effectively excused the gods and &quot;Ṛta&quot; from the appearance of evil in the world, placing the responsibility for the same squarely upon the individual.

Being an extension of &quot;Ṛta&quot;, &quot;Karma&quot; was conceived of as operating with the same absolute efficiency. As Day (1982) notes, &quot;acts are causally determinative in accordance with their good or evil nature, and their out-workings are inexorable; there is no intrusive or arbitrary factor which might overcome their potentiality for causing retributional effects, or otherwise interfering with the strictly mechanical efficiency of &quot;Karma&quot;. Since, moreover, an individual&#x27;s fortunes and misfortunes are solely the outcome of his past actions, he has no ground for believing that life is kindlier or harsher than is deserved. He has no cause either for praising God&#x27;s benevolence nor for lamenting God&#x27;s wrath.&quot;

==In proper names==
&quot;Ṛta-&quot; or &quot;arta-&quot; sometimes appears as an element in Vedic and Indic personal names, as with Iranian.

In India the vocalic &#x27;ṛ&#x27; of Sanskrit is transformed into the modern &#x27;ri&#x27;, or in South India, &#x27;ru&#x27;. Indian names include:
* Rita
* Ruta 
* Ritambhar
* Ritik 
* Ritwik
* Ritesh 

Mitanni (non-Indian, Vedic) names include:
* Artatama I
* Artashumara
* Artamanya, leader of Ziribashani

<text>Abarimon or antipode in mythology are people whose feet are reversed, however, in spite of this disability, were able to run at extreme speeds.

This majestic tribe was first described in Europe by Pliny the Elder, in his book, &quot;Natural History&quot; (VII 11), who believed them to be native to India. A tale that is alike is depicted by Aulus Gellius in &quot;Attic Nights&quot;.

They coexisted with wild animals and any endeavor to capture them was unsuccessful because they were so ferocious and barbarian. In his book, Pliny points out information that derives from Baiton, Alexander the Great&#x27;s Land Surveyor. Because of the special quality of air, the &quot;abarimons&quot; were only able to breathe the air of their own domestic valleys, according to Baiton. If the special quality of air was breathed for a long period of time, breathing any other type of air would be impossible. Because of this, the inhabitants were not able to depart from the valley and live elsewhere in the world. Therefore, it was impossible to entrap them and shepard them to the courts of a distant ruler, or to the great Macedonian conquest.

It is very feasible that this is an overly designed ethnographic description of a prehistoric wildlife strain in the areas near Himalayas.

As stated by a different legend, Abarimon is referred to as a landscape found in Scythia, a valley of Mount Imaus, (which may be indistinguishable to Hindukush or the Himalayan Mountains).

Later, Abarimon has been summarized in Thomas Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Thesaurus Linguae Romanae et Britannicae&quot;, as a tribe in the country &quot;Tataria&quot;. Throughout the Middle Ages, after a familiar heliocentric view, some map drawers made creatures in the shape of Abarimon people and positioned them at the outermost border of the world.

<text>Adimurti () is a form of the Hindu deity Vishnu. It is regarded to be similar to his form of Narayana. In this form, Vishnu is depicted to be seated upon the coils of his serpent, Shesha.

== Iconography ==
Adimurti is a four-armed representation of Vishnu, portraying his primordial form. He is seated in the sukhasana pose upon the coils of a snake, with his left leg folded over the serpent, and the right leg hanging sideways. Five or seven heads of Shesha form a canopy over his head, and hold the symbols of the deity. He is accompanied by his two consorts.

<doc id="100318" wikidata="Q390857" url="?curid=100318" title="Agastya">
<text>Agastya was a revered Indian sage of Hinduism. In the Indian tradition, he is a noted recluse and an influential scholar in diverse languages of the Indian subcontinent. He is regarded in some traditions to be a Chiranjivi. He and his wife Lopamudra are the celebrated authors of hymns 1.165 to 1.191 in the Sanskrit text &quot;Rigveda&quot; and other Vedic literature.

Agastya is considered to be the father of Siddha medicine. Agastya appears in numerous itihasas and Puranas including the major &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. He is one of the seven most revered rishis (the Saptarishi) in the Vedic texts, and is revered as one of the Tamil Siddhar in the Shaivism tradition, who invented an early grammar of the Old Tamil language, Agattiyam, playing a pioneering role in the development of Tampraparniyan medicine and spirituality at Saiva centres in proto-era Sri Lanka and South India. He is also revered in the Puranic literature of Shaktism and Vaishnavism. He is one of the Indian sages found in ancient sculpture and reliefs in Hindu temples of South Asia, and Southeast Asia such as in the early medieval era Shaiva temples on Java Indonesia. He is the principal figure and Guru in the ancient Javanese language text &quot;Agastyaparva&quot;, whose 11th-century version survives.

Agastya is traditionally attributed to be the author of many Sanskrit texts such as the &quot;Agastya Gita&quot; found in &quot;Varaha Purana&quot;, &quot;Agastya Samhita&quot; found embedded in &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, and the &quot;Dvaidha-Nirnaya Tantra&quot; text. He is also referred to as Mana, Kalasaja, Kumbhaja, Kumbhayoni and Maitravaruni after his mythical origins.

==Etymology and nomenclature==

Several different etymologies have been suggested for &quot;Agastya&quot;. One theory states that the root is &quot;Aj&quot; or &quot;Anj&quot;, which connotes &quot;brighten, effulgent one&quot; and links Agastya to &quot;one who brightens&quot; in darkness, and Agastya is traditionally the Indian name for Canopus, the second most brilliantly shining star found in skies in the Indian sub-continent, next to Sirius. 
A third theory links it to Indo-European origins, through the Iranian word &quot;gasta&quot; which means &quot;sin, foul&quot;, and &quot;a-gasta&quot; would mean &quot;not sin, not foul&quot;. The fourth theory, based on folk etymology in verse 2.11 of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; states that Agastya is from &quot;aga&quot; (unmoving or mountain) and &quot;gam&quot; (move), and together these roots connote &quot;one who is mover-of-mountains&quot;, or &quot;mover-of-the-unmoving&quot;. The word is also written as Agasti and Agathiyar.

==Biography==

Agastya is the named author of several hymns of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. These hymns do not provide his biography. The origins of Agastya - Pulastya, one of the Rig Vedic Saptarishis is his father. His miraculous rebirth follows a yajna being done by gods Varuna and Mitra, where the celestial apsara Urvashi appears. They are overwhelmed by her extraordinary sexuality and ejaculate. Their semen falls into a mud pitcher, which is the womb in which the fetus of Agastya grows. He is born from this jar, along with his twin sage Vashistha in some mythologies. This mythology gives him the name &quot;kumbhayoni&quot;, which literally means &quot;he whose womb was a mud pot&quot;.

Agastya is a Tamil Brahmin (Maraiyar) who leads an ascetic life, educates himself, becoming a celebrated sage. His unknown origins have led to speculative proposals that the Vedic-era Agastya may have been a migrant whose ideas influenced the south.

According to inconsistent legends in the Puranic and the epics, the ascetic sage Agastya proposed to Lopamudra, a princess born in the kingdom of Vidarbha. Her parents were unwilling to bless the engagement, concerned that she would be unable to live the austere lifestyle of Agastya in the forest. However, the legends state that Lopamudra accepted him as her husband, saying that Agastya has the wealth of ascetic living, her own youth will fade with seasons, and it is his virtue that makes him the right person. Therewith, Lopamudra becomes the wife of Agastya. In other versions, Lopamudra marries Agastya, but after the wedding, she demands that Agastya provide her with basic comforts before she will consummate the marriage, a demand that ends up forcing Agastya to return to society and earn wealth.

Agastya and Lopamudra have a son named Drdhasyu, sometimes called Idhmavaha. He is described in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; as a boy who learns the Vedas by listening to his parents while he is in the womb, and is born into the world reciting the hymns.

===Agastya ashram===
Agastya had a hermitage (&quot;ashram&quot;), but the ancient and medieval era Indian texts provide inconsistent stories and location for this &quot;ashram&quot;. Two legends place it in Northwest Maharashtra, on the banks of the river Godavari, near Nashik in small towns named &quot;Agastyapuri&quot; and &quot;Akole&quot;. Other putative sites mentioned in Northern and Eastern Indian sources are near Sangli in Ainwadi (Agastinagar) (Tal-khanapur) village (Western ghats at Maharashtra), or near Kannauj (Uttar Pradesh), or in Agastyamuni village near Rudraprayag (Uttarakhand), or Satpura Range (Madhya Pradesh). In Southern sources and the North Indian &quot;Devi-Bhagavata Purana&quot;, his &quot;ashram&quot; is based in Tamil Nadu, variously placed in Tirunelveli, the Pothigai Hills, or Thanjavur. Facing east, he penanced upon a rock at Kanyakumari immediately after the beginning of &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;. It is also considered that his final resting place is in Agastyarkoodam in Thiruvananthapuram.

==Textual sources==

===Vedas===
Agastya is mentioned in all the four Vedas of Hinduism, and is a character in the Brahmanas, Aranyakas, Upanishads, epics, and many Puranas. He is the author of hymns 1.165 to 1.191 of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; (~1200 BCE). He ran a Vedic school (&quot;gurukul&quot;), as evidenced by hymn 1.179 of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; which credits its author to be his wife Lopamudra and his students. He was a respected sage in the Vedic era, as many other hymns of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; composed by other sages refer to Agastya. The hymns composed by Agastya are known for verbal play and similes, puzzles and puns, and striking imagery embedded within his spiritual message.

His Vedic poetry is particularly notable for two themes. In one set of hymns, Agastya describes a conflict between two armies led by gods Indra and Maruts, which scholars such as G. S. Ghurye have interpreted as an allegory of a conflict between Arya (Indra) and Dasa (Rudra). Agastya successfully reconciles their conflict, makes an offering wherein he prays for understanding and loving-kindness between the two. Twenty one out of the twenty seven hymns he composed in Mandala 1 of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; have his signature ending, wherein he appeals, &quot;may each community know refreshment (food) and lively waters&quot;. These ideas have led him to be considered as a protector of both the Arya and the Dasa. However, some scholars interpret the same hymns to be an allegory for any two conflicting ideologies or lifestyles, because Agastya never uses the words Arya or Dasa, and only uses the phrase &quot;ubhau varnav&quot; (literally, &quot;both colors&quot;). The theme and idea of &quot;mutual understanding&quot; as a means for lasting reconciliation, along with Agastya&#x27;s name, reappears in section 1.2.2 of the &quot;Aitareya Aranyaka&quot; of Hinduism.

The second theme, famous in the literature of Hinduism, is a discussion between his wife Lopamudra and him about the human tension between the monastic solitary pursuit of spirituality, versus the responsibility of a householder&#x27;s life and raising a family. Agastya argues that there are many ways to happiness and liberation, while Lopamudra presents her arguments about the nature of life, time and the possibility of both. She successfully seduces Agastya, in the simile filled Rigvedic hymn 1.179.

Agastya is mentioned in both the oldest and the youngest layers of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; (–1200 BCE), such as in hymn 33 of mandala 7, which is older than mandala 1. He is also mentioned in the other three Vedas and the Vedanga literature such as in verses 5.13–14 of the &quot;Nirukta&quot;. Agastya and his ideas are cited in numerous other Vedic texts, such as section 7.5.5 of &quot;Taittiriya Samhita&quot;, 10.11 of &quot;Kathaka Samhita&quot;, 2.1 of &quot;Maitrayani Samhita&quot;, 5.16 of &quot;Aitareya Brahmana&quot;, 2.7.11 of &quot;Taittiriya Brahmana&quot;, and 21.14 of &quot;Pancavimsati Brahmana&quot;.

===Ramayana===

Sage Agastya is mentioned in the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot; in several chapters with his hermitage described to be on the banks of river Godavari.

In the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Agastya and Lopamudra are described as living in Dandaka forest, on the southern slopes of Vindhya mountains. Rama praises Agastya as the one who can do what gods find impossible. He is described by Rama as the sage who asked Vindhya mountains to lower themselves so that Sun, Moon and living beings could easily pass over it. He is also described as the sage who used his Dharma powers to kill demons Vatapi and Ilwala after they had jointly misled and destroyed 9,000 men.

Agastya, according to the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, is a unique sage, who is short and heavy in build, but by living in the south he balances the powers of Shiva and the weight of Kailasha and Mount Meru. Agastya and his wife meet Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He gives them a divine bow and arrow, describes the evil nature of Ravana and, according to William Buck, B. A. van Nooten and Shirley Triest, bids them goodbye with the advice, &quot;Rama, demons do not love men, therefore men must love each other&quot;.

===Mahabharata===
The story of Agastya is mirrored in the second major Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. However, instead of Rama, the story is told as a conversation between Yudhishthira and Lomasa starting with section 96 of Book 3, the &quot;Vana Parva&quot; (the Book of Forest).

He is described in the epic as a sage with enormous powers of ingestion and digestion. Agastya, once again, stops the Vindhya mountains from growing and lowers them and he kills the demons Vatapi and Ilvala much the same mythical way as in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. The &quot;Vana Parva&quot; also describes the story of Lopamudra and Agastya getting engaged and married. It also contains the mythical story of a war between Indra and Vritra, where all the demons hide in the sea, and the gods request Agastya for help; Agastya then drinks up the ocean, revealing the demons to the gods.

===Puranas===
The Puranic literature of Hinduism has numerous stories about Agastya, more elaborate, more fantastical and inconsistent than the mythologies found in Vedic and Epics literature of India. For example, chapter 61 of the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot;, chapter 22 of &quot;Padma Purana&quot;, and seven other Maha Puranas tell the entire biography of Agastya. Some list him as one of the &quot;Saptarishi&quot; (seven great rishi), while in others he is one of the eight or twelve extraordinary sages of the Hindu traditions. The names and details are not consistent across the different Puranas, nor in different manuscript versions of the same Purana. He is variously listed along with Angiras, Atri, Bhrigu, Bhargava, Bharadvaja, Visvamitra, Vasistha, Kashyapa, Gautama, Jamadagni and others.

Agastya is reverentially mentioned in the Puranas of all major Hindu traditions: Shaivism, Shaktism and Vaishnavism. Many of the Puranas include lengthy and detailed accounts of the descendants of Agastya and other &quot;Saptarishis&quot;.

===Tamil texts===

In Tamil traditions, Agastya is considered as the &quot;father of the Tamil language&quot; and the compiler of the first Tamil grammar, called &quot;Agattiyam&quot; or &quot;Akattiyam&quot;. Agastya has been a culture hero in Tamil traditions and appears in numerous Tamil texts. Agastya learnt the Tamil language from god Murugan when he arrived in the southern Tamil country from north India.

There are similarities and differences between the Northern and Southern (Tamil) traditions about Agastya. According to Iravatham Mahadevan, both traditions state that Agastya migrated from north to south. The Tamil text &quot;Purananuru&quot;, dated to about the start of the common era, or possibly about 2nd century CE, in verse 201 mentions Agastya along with many people migrating south.

In the northern legends, Agastya&#x27;s role in spreading Vedic tradition and Sanskrit is emphasized, while in southern traditions his role in spreading irrigation, agriculture and augmenting the Tamil language is emphasized. In the north, his ancestry is unknown with mythical legends limiting themselves to saying that Agastya was born from a mud pitcher. In southern traditions, his descent from a pitcher is a common reference, but two alternate southern legends place him as the Caṅkam (&quot;Sangam&quot;) polity and is said to have led the migration of eighteen Vēlir tribes from Dvārakā to the south.

The northern traditional stories, states Mahadevan, are &quot;nothing more than a collection of incredible fables and myths&quot;, while the southern versions &quot;ring much truer and appear to be a down to earth account of a historical event&quot;. Others disagree. According to K.N. Sivaraja Pillai, for example, there is nothing in the early Sangam literature or any Tamil texts prior to about the mid 1st millennium CE that mentions Agastya. The earliest mention of the role of Agastya in Tamil language, according to Richard Weiss, can be traced to the &quot;Iraiyanar Akapporul&quot; by 8th-century Nakkirar. However, in medieval era stories of the Tamil tradition, Agastya pioneered the first &quot;sangam&quot; period that lasted 4,440 years, and took part in the second &quot;sangam&quot; period that lasted another 3,700 years.

The &quot;Tirumantiram&quot; describes Agastya as an ascetic sage, who came from the north and settled in the southern Pothigai mountains because Shiva asked him to. He is described as the one who perfected and loved both Sanskrit and Tamil languages, amassing knowledge in both, thus becoming a symbol of integration, harmony and learning, instead of being opposed to either. According to the Skanda Purana, the whole world visited the Himalayas when Shiva was about to wed Parvati. This caused the earth to tip to one side. Shiva then requested Agastya to go to the southern region to restore the equilibrium. Thus, Agastya migrated south at Shiva&#x27;s behest.

====Siddhar====

Agastya, in Tamil Hindu traditions, is considered as the first and foremost Siddhar (Tamil: &quot;cittar&quot;, Sanskrit: &quot;siddha&quot;). A &quot;siddhar&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit verbal root &quot;sidh&quot; which means &quot;to accomplish or succeed&quot;. As the first &quot;Siddhar&quot;, Agastya is deemed as the first master, accomplished, the sage who perfected his knowledge of the natural and spiritual worlds. This Tamil concept has parallels to Tibetan &quot;mahasiddhas&quot;, Sri Lankan Buddhist, and Nath Hindu yogi traditions of north India.

Agastya, along with Tirumular, is considered a &quot;siddhar&quot; in both philosophical and practical domains, unlike most other &quot;siddhar&quot; who are revered for their special domain of knowledge. Agastya is also unique for the reverence he has received in historic texts all over the Indian subcontinent.

According to Venkatraman, the &quot;Siddhar&quot;-related literature about Agastya is late medieval to early modern era. In particular, all medicine and health-related Tamil text, that include Agastya as the &quot;Siddhar&quot;, have been composed in and after the 15th century. According to Hartmut Scharfe, the oldest medicine siddhar Tamil text mentioning Agastya were composed no earlier than the 16th century.

His name is spelled as &quot;Agathiyar&quot; or &quot;Agasthiyar&quot; in some Tamil texts, and some consider the writer of the medical texts to be a different person.

According to Kamil Zvelebil, the sage Agastya, &quot;Akattiyan&quot; the Siddhar, and Akatthiyar, the author of &quot;Akattiyam&quot;, were three or possibly four different persons of different eras, who over time became fused into one single person in the Tamil tradition.

===Buddhist texts===
Several Buddhist texts mention Agastya. Just like early Buddhist texts such as &quot;Kalapa&quot;, &quot;Katantra&quot; and &quot;Candra-vyakarana&quot; adapting Panini, and Asvaghosa adopting the more ancient Sanskrit poetic methodology as he praises the Buddha, Agastya appears in 1st millennium CE Buddhist texts. In Tamil texts, for example, Akattiyan is described as the sage who learnt Tamil and Sanskrit grammar and poetics from Avalokitan (another name for Buddha-to-be Avalokiteśvara).
According to Anne E. Monius, the &quot;Manimekalai&quot; and &quot;Viracoliyam&quot; are two of many South Indian texts that co-opt Agastya and make him a student of the Buddha-to-be.

Agastya elsewhere appears in other historic Buddhist mythologies, such as the Jataka tales. For example, the Buddhist text &quot;Jataka-mala&quot; by Aryasura, about the Buddha&#x27;s previous lives, includes Agastya as the seventh chapter. The &quot;Agastya-Jataka&quot; story is carved as a relief in the Borobudur, the world&#x27;s largest early medieval era Mahayana Buddhist temple.

===Javanese and Indian texts===
Agastya is one of the most important figures in several medieval-era Southeast Asian inscriptions, temple reliefs and arts. He was particularly popular in Java due to his teaching of

Saiva Siddhanta was easily accepted into the Javanese society. He introduced the Vedic science and the Pallavan Grantha script, but his popularity declined when Islam started to spread throughout the islands of Indonesia. He is also found in Cambodia, Vietnam and other regions. The earliest mentions of Agastya are traceable to about the mid 1st millennium CE, but the 11th-century Javanese language text &quot;Agastya-parva&quot; is a remarkable combination of philosophy, mythology and genealogy attributed to sage Agastya.

The &quot;Agastya-parva&quot; includes Sanskrit verse (&quot;shlokas&quot;) embedded within the Javanese language. The text is structured as a conversation between a &quot;Guru&quot; (teacher, Agastya) and a &quot;Sisya&quot; (student, Agastya&#x27;s son Drdhasyu). The style is a mixture of didactic, philosophical and theological treatise, covering diverse range of topics much like Hindu Puranas. The chapters of the Javanese text include the Indian theory of cyclic existence, rebirth and samsara, creation of the world by the churning of the ocean (&quot;samudra manthan&quot;), theories of the Samkhya and the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, major sections on god Shiva and Shaivism, some discussion of Tantra, a manual-like summary of ceremonies associated with the rites of passage and others.

While the similarities between the &quot;Agastya-parva&quot; text and classical Indian ideas are obvious, according to Jan Gonda, the Indian counterpart of this text in Sanskrit or Tamil languages have not been found in Indonesia or in India. Similarly other Agastya-related Indonesian texts, dated to be from the 10th to 12th centuries, discuss ideas from multiple sub-schools of Shaivism such as theistic Shaivasiddhanta and monistic Agamic Pashupata, and these texts declare these theologies to be of equal merit and value.
Agastya is common in medieval-era Shiva temples of Southeast Asia, such as the stone temples in Java (candi). Along with the iconography of Shiva, Uma, Nandi and Ganesha who face particular cardinal directions, these temples include a sculpture, image or relief of Agastya carved into the southern face. The Shiva shrine in the largest Hindu temple complex in southeast Asia, Prambanan, features four cellae in its interior. This central shrine within Prambanan group of temples dedicates its southern cella to Agastya.

The Dinoyo inscription, dated to 760 CE, is primarily dedicated to Agastya. The inscription states that his older wooden image was remade in stone, thereby suggesting that the reverence for Agastya iconography in southeast Asia was prevalent in an older period. In Cambodia, the 9th-century king Indravarman, who is remembered for sponsoring the building of a large number of historic temples and related artworks, is declared in the texts of this period to be a descendant of sage Agastya.

===Agastya Samhita===

&quot;Agastya Saṁhitā&quot; (literally: &quot;Agastya&#x27;s Compendium&quot;) is the title of several works in Sanskrit, attributed to Agastya.

One of those works is the &quot;Agastya Samhita&quot;, sometimes called the &quot;Sankara Samhita&quot;, a section embedded in the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;. It was probably composed in late medieval era, but before the 12th-century. It exists in many versions, and is structured as a dialogue between Skanda and Agastya. Scholars such as Moriz Winternitz state that the authenticity of the surviving version of this document is doubtful because Shaiva celebrities such as Skanda and Agastya teach Vaishnavism ideas and the bhakti (devotional worship) of Rama, mixed in with a tourist guide about Shiva temples in Varanasi and other parts of India.

===Agastimata===
Agastya is attributed to be the author of &quot;Agastimata&quot;, a pre–10th-century treatise about gems and diamonds, with chapters on the origins, qualities, testing and making jewellery from them. Several other Sanskrit texts on gems and lapidary are also credited to Agastya in the Indian traditions.

===Others===
Other mentions of Agastya include:
*&quot;Bṛhaddevatā&quot; in section 5.134.
*The Lalita sahasranama of Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, which describes the 1000 names of the goddess Lalita is a part of the &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot;. It is presented as a teaching from Hayagriya (an avatar of Viṣṇu) to Agastya.
*Agastya is credited as the creator of the Āditya Hṛdayam (literally, &quot;heart of the sun&quot;), a hymn to Sūrya he told Rama to recite, so that he may win against Ravana. Scholars such as John Muir questioned this hymn since the need for a such a hymn by Rama implies doubts about his divine nature.
*&quot;Lakshmi Stotram&quot; and &quot;Saraswati Stotram&quot;.
*The Tamil text &quot;Pattuppattu&quot; states Agastya to be master of &quot;icai&quot; (music, song).
* Kalidasa, in his &quot;Raghuvaṃśa&quot; (6.61) states that Agastya officiated the horse sacrifice of a Pandya king of Madurai.
*One of the authors of Nadi Shastra / Nadi astrology

==Legacy==

===Temples===
Temples for Agastya are found in Tamil Nadu. They include the Sri Agasthiyar Temple at Agasthiyar Falls (Kalyana Theertham) in Papanasam (Thirunelveli District) and the Sri Lobamudra Samedha Agasthiyar Temple in the Arulmigu Chidambara Vinayagar Thirukoil at Vellalapatti (Madurai District) (7 km from Alagarkovil). There is a temple for Agastya on top of Agastya Mala

Agastya statues or reliefs feature in numerous early medieval temples of north India, south India and Southeast Asia. One famous Agastya temple is also located in Uttarakhand in the town of Agastyamuni. The town derived its name from the name of Sage Agastya. The &quot;Dasavatara temple&quot; in Deogarh (Uttar Pradesh, near Madhya Pradesh border) features a 6th-century Gupta Empire era Agastya carving. In Karnataka similarly, he is reverentially shown in several 7th-century temples such as the Mallikarjuna temple in Mahakuta and the Parvati temple in Sandur. He is a part of many Chalukya era Shaivism temples in the Indian subcontinent peninsula.

The artistic iconography of South Asian and Southeast Asian temples show common themes such as he holding a pitcher, but also differences. For example, Agastya is featured inside or outside of the temple walls and sometimes as a guardian at the entrance (&quot;dvarapala&quot;), with or without a potbelly, with or without a receding hairline, with or without a dagger and sword. Rock cut temples and caves, such as the 8th-century Pandya rock temples group, show Agastya.

===Literature===
The shrine to Agastya at the Pothigai hill source of the river is mentioned in both Ilango Adigal&#x27;s &quot;Silappatikaram&quot; and Chithalai Chathanar&#x27;s &quot;Manimekhalai&quot; epics.

Similarly, the Sanskrit plays &quot;Anargharāghava&quot; and Rajasekhara&#x27;s &quot;Bālarāmāyaṇa&quot; of the 9th century refer to a shrine of Agastya on or near Adam&#x27;s Peak (Sri Pada), the tallest mountain in Sri Lanka (ancient Tamraparni), from whence the river Gona Nadi/Kala Oya flows into the Gulf of Mannar&#x27;s Puttalam Lagoon.

===Martial arts===
Maharishi Agastya is regarded as the founder of Silambam, an Indian martial art from Tamil Nadu, and &quot;varmam,&quot; an ancient science of healing using varmam points for varied diseases which is also utilized by practitioners of the southern form of Kalaripayattu, an Indian martial art from Kerala. Murugan, the son of Shiva, is said to have taught &quot;varmam&quot; to Agastya, who then wrote treatises on it and passed it on to other siddhar.

<doc id="100320" wikidata="Q796591" url="?curid=100320" title="Ahalya">
<text>In Hinduism, Ahalya (, IAST: Ahalyā) also spelt as Ahilya, is the wife of the sage Gautama Maharishi. Many Hindu scriptures describe her legend of seduction by the king of the gods Indra, her husband&#x27;s curse for her infidelity, and her liberation from the curse by the god Rama.

Created by the god Brahma as the most beautiful woman, Ahalya was married to the much older Gautama. In the earliest full narrative, when Indra comes disguised as her husband, Ahalya sees through his disguise but nevertheless accepts his advances. Later sources often absolve her of all guilt, describing how she falls prey to Indra&#x27;s trickery. In all narratives, Ahalya and Indra are cursed by Gautama. The curse varies from text to text, but almost all versions describe Rama as the eventual agent of her liberation and redemption. Although early texts describe how Ahalya must atone by undergoing severe penance while remaining invisible to the world and how she is purified by offering Rama hospitality, in the popular retelling developed over time, Ahalya is cursed to become a stone and regains her human form after she is brushed by Rama&#x27;s foot.

Ahalya&#x27;s seduction by Indra and its repercussions form the central narrative of her story in all scriptural sources for her legend. Although the &quot;Brahmanas&quot; (9th to 6th centuries BCE) are the earliest scriptures to hint at her relationship with Indra, the 5th- to 4th-century BCE Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot; – whose protagonist is Rama – is the first to explicitly mention her extra-marital affair in detail. Medieval story-tellers often focus on Ahalya&#x27;s deliverance by Rama, which is seen as proof of the saving grace of God. Her story has been retold numerous times in the scriptures and lives on in modern-age poetry and short stories, as well as in dance and drama. While ancient narratives are Rama-centric, contemporary ones focus on Ahalya, telling the story from her perspective. Other traditions focus on her children.

In traditional Hinduism, Ahalya is extolled as the first of the &quot;panchakanya&quot; (&quot;five maidens&quot;), archetypes of female chastity whose names are believed to dispel sin when recited. While some praise her loyalty to her husband and her undaunted acceptance of the curse and gender norms, others condemn her adultery.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Ahalya&quot; can be divided into two parts: &quot;a&quot; (a prefix indicating negation) and &quot;halya&quot;, which Sanskrit dictionaries define as being related to the plough, ploughing, or deformity. In the &quot;Uttar Kanda&quot; book of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the god Brahma explains the meaning of the Sanskrit word &quot;Ahalya&quot; as &quot;one without the reprehension of ugliness&quot;, or &quot;one with an impeccable beauty&quot; while telling Indra how he created Ahalya by taking the special beauty of all creation and expressing it in every part of her body. Because some Sanskrit dictionaries translate Ahalya as &quot;unploughed,&quot; some recent authors view this as an implicit reference to sexual intercourse and argue that the name refers to a virgin or a motherly figure. This fits the context of the character Ahalya, who is viewed as being in one way or another beyond Indra&#x27;s reach. However, Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941), focusing on the literal meaning of &quot;unploughed,&quot; interpreted Ahalya as a symbol of stone-like, infertile land that was made cultivable by Rama. Delhi University professor Bharati Jhaveri concurs with Tagore, interpreting Ahalya as unploughed land, on the basis of the tribal Bhil &quot;Ramayana&quot; of Gujarat, an undated oral tradition.

== Creation and marriage ==
Ahalya is often described as an &quot;ayonijasambhava&quot;, one not born of a woman. The &quot;Bala Kanda&quot; of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; (5th to 4th century BCE) mentions that Brahma moulds her &quot;with great effort out of pure creative energy&quot;. The &quot;Brahma Purana&quot; (401–1300 CE) and the &quot;Vishnudharmottara Purana&quot; (401–500 CE) also record her creation by Brahma. According to the Mahari dance tradition, Brahma created Ahalya out of water as the most beautiful woman in order to break the pride of Urvashi, the foremost &quot;apsara&quot;. The tribal Bhil &quot;Ramayana&quot; begins with the tale of Ahalya, Gautama and Indra. In the tale, Ahalya is created from the ashes of the sacrificial fire by the Saptarishi (seven seers) and gifted to Gautama. In contrast, the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; (501–1000 CE) and the &quot;Harivamsa&quot; (1–300 CE) regard Ahalya as a princess of the Puru Dynasty, the daughter of King Mudgala and sister of King Divodasa.

In the &quot;Uttara Kanda&quot; book of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; (regarded by most scholars as a later addition to the epic), Brahma crafts Ahalya as the most beautiful woman and places her in the care of Gautama until she reaches puberty. When that time arrives, the sage returns Ahalya to Brahma, who, impressed by Gautama&#x27;s sexual restraint and asceticism, bestows her upon him. Indra, who believes that the best women are meant for him, resents Ahalya&#x27;s marriage to the forest-dwelling ascetic.

The &quot;Brahma Purana&quot; gives a similar account of Ahalya&#x27;s birth and initial custody, recording that her marriage was determined through an open contest. Brahma declares that the first being to go around the three worlds (heaven, earth and the underworld) will win Ahalya. Indra uses his magical powers to complete the challenge, finally reaching Brahma and demanding the hand of Ahalya. However, the divine sage Narada tells Brahma that Gautama went around the three worlds before Indra. Narada explains that Gautama circumambulated the wish-bearing cow Surabhi while she gave birth, as part of his daily &quot;puja&quot; (ritual offering), making the cow equal to three worlds according to the &quot;Vedas&quot;. Brahma agrees and Ahalya marries Gautama, leaving Indra envious and infuriated. A similar, but shorter, version of Ahalya&#x27;s early life appears in the &quot;Padma Purana&quot; (701–1200 CE).

In all versions of the tale, after marrying Gautama, Ahalya settles into his ashram (hermitage), which generally becomes the site of her epic curse. The &quot;Ramayana&quot; records that Gautama&#x27;s ashram is in a forest (&quot;Mithila-upavana&quot;) near Mithila, where the couple practices asceticism together for several years. In other scriptures, the ashram is usually near the river bank. The &quot;Brahma Purana&quot; says that it is near the river Godavari and the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; (701–1200 CE) places it near the river Narmada. The &quot;Padma Purana&quot; and the &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana&quot; (801–1100 CE) describe the ashram as near the holy city of Pushkar.

== Hints of a relationship with Indra ==
The &quot;Brahmana&quot;s (9th to 6th centuries BCE) are the oldest scriptures to mention a relationship between Ahalya and Indra in the &quot;&quot;subrahmanya&quot; formula&quot;, a chant used by Vedic priests &quot;at the beginning of a sacrifice to invite the main participants: Indra, the gods and the Brahmins&quot; (priests). The &quot;Jaiminiya Brahmana&quot; and the &quot;Sadvimsha Brahmana&quot; from the Samaveda tradition, the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; and the &quot;Taittiriya Brahmana&quot; from the Yajurveda tradition and two &quot;Shrautasutra&quot;s (&quot;Latyayana&quot; and &quot;Drahyayana&quot;) invoke Indra, the &quot;lover of Ahalya ... O Kaushika [Brahmin], who calls himself Gautama&quot;. The Samaveda tradition identifies her as Maitreyi, who the commentator Sayana (died 1387) explains is &quot;the daughter of [the god] Mitra&quot;.

In the &quot;subrahmanya&quot; formula, Ahalya does not have a husband. The &quot;Sadvimsha Brahmana&quot; does not explicitly state that Ahalya has a husband, although Kaushika (interpreted by most scholars as Ahalya&#x27;s husband) is present in the story and his relationship to her can be inferred through Indra&#x27;s adoption of the Brahmin&#x27;s form to &quot;visit&quot; Ahalya. Renate Söhnen-Thieme, research associate at the feels that the Kaushika of the &quot;Sadvimsha Brahmana&quot; is the same individual described as cursing Indra in the 5th- to 4th-century BCE epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot; (discussed below in &quot;Curse and redemption&quot;).

The &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot;&#x27;s commentator, Kumarila Bhatta (c. 700), reasons that the Ahalya–Indra narrative is an allegory for the Sun or the light (Indra) taking away the shade of night (Ahalya). Edward Washburn Hopkins, an American indologist, interpreted the Ahalya of the &quot;subrahmanya&quot; formula not as a woman, but literally as &quot;yet unploughed land&quot;, which Indra makes fertile.

== Seduction by Indra ==

The &quot;Bala Kanda&quot; of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; is the earliest text to describe Ahalya&#x27;s seduction in detail. It states that Indra becomes enamoured by Ahalya&#x27;s beauty, learns of her husband&#x27;s absence and comes to the ashram disguised as Gautama to request sexual intercourse with her, praising her as a shapely and slim-waisted woman. She sees through his disguise, but consents owing to her &quot;curiosity&quot;. According to another interpretation, Ahalya&#x27;s pride in her beauty compels her. Having satiated his lust, Ahalya requests that Indra, her &quot;lover&quot; and the &quot;best of gods&quot;, flee and protect them from Gautama&#x27;s wrath. The &quot;Kathasaritsagara&quot; (11th century CE) is one of the few texts that mirror the &quot;Bala Kanda&quot;&#x27;s Ahalya, who makes a conscious decision to accept Indra&#x27;s advances. However, in this text Indra arrives undisguised.

Although the &quot;Bala Kanda&quot; mentions that Ahalya consciously commits adultery, the &quot;Uttara Kanda&quot; of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Puranas&quot; (compiled between the 4th and 16th centuries CE) absolve her of all guilt. The &quot;Uttara Kanda&quot; recasts the tale as Ahalya&#x27;s rape by Indra. In one allusion in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, King Nahusha reminds Brihaspati, Indra&#x27;s guru, how Indra &quot;violated&quot; the &quot;renowned&quot; &quot;rishi-patni&quot; (wife of a sage) Ahalya. According to Söhnen-Thieme, the usage of the words &quot;violated&quot; and &quot;renowned&quot; indicates that Ahalya is not considered an adulteress. This occurs because, according to the &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot;, when Nahusha took over the position of Indra when the latter went into hiding after killing Vritra, starts to fall in love with Indra&#x27;s consort, Shachi, and force himself on her. To justify this after the devas were against it, Nahusha reminds them, including Brihaspati, Indra&#x27;s guru, about Indra&#x27;s relationship with Ahalya. 
The &quot;Puranas&quot; introduce themes that are echoed in later works, including the deception of the unsuspecting Ahalya by Indra&#x27;s devious disguise as Gautama in his absence. The &quot;Padma Purana&quot; states that after Gautama leaves for his ritual bath, Indra masquerades as Gautama and asks Ahalya to satisfy him. Ahalya, engrossed in worship, rejects him, considering it inappropriate to have sex at the cost of neglecting the gods. Indra reminds her that her first duty is to serve him. Finally Ahalya gives in, but Gautama learns of Indra&#x27;s deception through his supernatural powers and returns to the ashram. A similar account is found in the &quot;Brahma Purana&quot;. At times, Indra takes the form of a cock that crows to dispatch Gautama for his morning ablutions, as in the 18th-century Telugu rendition of the tale by the warrior-poet Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka of the Madurai Nayak Dynasty. In other versions, he uses an accomplice, such as the moon-god Chandra, to distract Gautama. In the &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana&quot;, Ahalya comes to bathe in the &quot;Svarnadi&quot; (heavenly river) and Indra becomes infatuated with her when he sees her. Assuming Gautama&#x27;s form, Indra has sex with her until they sink to the river bed in exhaustion. However, Gautama catches them in the act. Another version in the same &quot;Purana&quot; focuses on the question of how the chaste Ahalya was seduced by Indra. In this version, Indra approaches Ahalya on the banks of the Mandakini river in his own form to ask for a sexual favour, which is flatly refused by Ahalya. Indra subsequently poses as Gautama and fulfils his objective.

In some versions, though initially deluded by Indra&#x27;s disguise, Ahalya eventually recognises the impersonator. In the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, Ahalya smells Indra&#x27;s celestial fragrance and realises her folly as he embraces and kisses her and &quot;so forth&quot; (probably indicating a sexual act). Threatening Indra with a curse, she compels him to reveal his true form. However, Kamban&#x27;s 12th-century Tamil adaptation of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the &quot;Ramavataram&quot;, narrates that Ahalya realises that her lover is an imposter but continues to enjoy the dalliance. Here, Ahalya agrees to have sex with the disguised Indra because she has long been craving affection from her ascetic husband.

In Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka&#x27;s Telugu rendition, Ahalya is depicted as a romantic adulteress. When Brahma creates Ahalya as the most beautiful being, she falls in love with Indra and longs for him, but Brahma grants her to Gautama. After Ahalya&#x27;s marriage, Indra too craves for her. He frequently visits her and flirts with her in Gautama&#x27;s absence. At one point, Ahalya receives a visit from Indra&#x27;s female messenger, who proceeds to mock husbands who avoid sex by saying that it is not the right day for pleasure. Ahalya protests, maintaining that she imagines Gautama to be Indra as they have sex and that a woman should be a stone, forgoing all thought of sexual gratification. That night, when Ahalya longs for conjugal bliss, Gautama refuses her, saying that she is not in her fertile period. Agitated, she wishes that Indra was there to satisfy her. Indra perceives her wish and comes in Gautama&#x27;s disguise, but is revealed by his seductive speech. Ignoring the deception, Ahalya joyously makes love to him.

== Curse and redemption ==
While most versions agree that Gautama curses Ahalya after discovering the affair, the curse varies from text to text. However, almost all versions describe Rama as the agent of her liberation and redemption.

=== Punishments of Ahalya and Indra ===

The &quot;Bala Kanda&quot; mentions that Gautama spots Indra, who is still in disguise, and curses him to lose his testicles. Gautama then curses Ahalya to remain invisible to all beings for thousands of years, fast by subsisting only on air, suffer and sleep in ashes and be tormented by guilt. Nevertheless, he assures her that her sin will be expiated once she extends her hospitality to Rama, who will visit the ashram. Thereafter, Gautama abandons the ashram and goes to the Himalayas to practise asceticism. The Ayodhya prince Rama, his brother Lakshmana and their guru, the sage Vishvamitra pass Gautama&#x27;s desolate ashram while travelling to King Janaka&#x27;s court in Mithila. As they near the ashram, Vishvamitra recounts the tale of Ahalya&#x27;s curse and instructs Rama to save Ahalya. Although Ahalya is cursed, Vishvamitra nevertheless describes her as goddess-like and illustrious, repeatedly calling her &quot;mahabhaga&quot;, a Sanskrit compound (&quot;maha&quot; and &quot;bhaga&quot;) translated as &quot;most illustrious and highly distinguished&quot;; this interpretation contrasts with that of Rambhadracharya, who believes that the word &quot;mahabhaga&quot;, in the context of Ahalya&#x27;s story, means &quot;extremely unfortunate&quot; (&quot;maha&quot; and &quot;abhaga&quot;). Following Vishvamitra, the princes enter the ashram to see Ahalya, who, up till then, had been hidden from the universe. Ahalya is described as glowing from the intensity of her ascetic devotion, but hidden from the world like the Sun obscured by dark clouds, the light of a full moon hidden by mist or a blazing flame masked by smoke. Under the direction of his guru, Rama considers Ahalya pure and unblemished and, accompanied by Lakshamana, gives her obeisance by touching her by his feet, an act that restores her social status. She greets them, recalling Gautama&#x27;s words that Rama would be her redeemer. Ahalya extends her warmest reception, making a &quot;welcome offering&quot; of forest fruits and washing their feet, an act of respect according to the rites of that era. The gods and other celestial beings shower Rama and Ahalya with flowers and bow to Ahalya, who has been purified through her penance. Gautama then returns to his ashram and accepts her.

In one instance in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Indra is said to have been cursed by having his beard turned to gold as he seduces Ahalya, while a curse by Kaushika (sometimes interpreted as synonymous to Gautama) is cited as the reason for his castration. In the &quot;Uttara Kanda&quot;, Indra is cursed to lose his throne and endure captivity and bear half the sin of every rape ever committed, while the innocent Ahalya is cursed to lose her status as the most beautiful woman, as it had prompted Indra&#x27;s seduction. Ahalya claims her innocence (this part is not found in all manuscripts), but Gautama agrees to accept her only when she is sanctified by offering Rama hospitality.

Ahalya&#x27;s defence plea is also found in some of the &quot;Purana&quot;s. In the &quot;Brahma Purana&quot;, Ahalya is cursed to become a dried up stream, but pleads her innocence and produces servants, who were also deceived by Indra&#x27;s disguise, as witnesses. Gautama reduces the curse on his &quot;faithful wife&quot; and she is redeemed when she joins the Gautami (Godavari) river as a stream. Indra is cursed to carry his shame in the form of a thousand vulvae on his body, but the vulvae turn into eyes as he bathes in the Gautami. The &quot;Brahma Purana&quot; is a rare exception where Rama is dropped from the narrative. Instead, the greatness of the Gautami river is illustrated. The &quot;Padma Purana&quot; tells that as Indra attempts to flee in the form of a cat, Gautama curses him to lose his genitals and to bear a thousand vulvae on his body. The beguiled Ahalya declares herself blameless, but Gautama considers her impure and curses her to be reduced to a mere skeleton of skin and bones. He decrees that she will regain her beautiful form when Rama laughs at seeing her so afflicted, dried out (a reminder of the dried stream motif), without a body (the &quot;Ramayana&quot; curse) and lying on the path (an attribute often used to describe a stone). When Rama comes, he proclaims her innocence and Indra&#x27;s guilt, whereupon Ahalya returns to her heavenly abode and dwells with Gautama.

=== Stone motifs ===

In the popular retelling of the legend in later works, as well as in theatre and electronic media, Ahalya is turned to stone by Gautama&#x27;s curse and returns to her human form only after being brushed by Rama&#x27;s foot. Pradip Bhattacharya, author of &quot;Panch-Kanya: The Five Virgins of Indian Epics&quot;, argues that this version of the tale is the result of a &quot;male backlash&quot; and patriarchal myth-making that condemns her as a non-entity devoid of emotions, self-respect and social status.

According to the &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana&quot;, Gautama curses Indra to bear a thousand vulvae, which will turn to eyes when he worships the sun-god Surya. Ahalya is turned to stone for sixty thousand years and destined to be redeemed only by Rama&#x27;s touch. Ahalya accepts the verdict without debate. In another version in the same &quot;Purana&quot;, Gautama catches Indra fleeing as a cat and curses him with castration. Ahalya&#x27;s plea of innocence is acknowledged by Gautama, who declares that her mind is pure and she has kept the &quot;vow of chastity and fidelity&quot;, but another man&#x27;s seed has defiled her body. Gautama orders her to go to the forest and become a stone until rescued by the touch of Rama&#x27;s feet. In Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka&#x27;s Telugu rendition, when Indra reluctantly leaves, Gautama arrives and curses Ahalya to become a stone, to be later purified by Rama&#x27;s feet. After she is freed from the curse, Gautama and Ahalya are reconciled and they spend their days in bed, exploring sexual techniques.

The &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; tells that when Gautama arrives, Ahalya explains the whole tale truthfully, but is cursed by Gautama to become a stone, because he believes that she acted as a rolling stone, unable to recognise the difference between Indra&#x27;s and Gautama&#x27;s gestures and movements. The touch of Rama&#x27;s feet is prophesied to be her saviour. The terrified Indra escapes as a cat and is cursed with castration. Ahalya&#x27;s truthfulness is also observed in the &quot;Kathasaritsagara&quot;. When Gautama arrives after the act, Indra tries to flee as a cat but is cursed to bear the marks of a thousand vulvae. When asked by Gautama about her visitor, Ahalya wittily answers that it was a &quot;majjara&quot;, a word meaning either &quot;cat&quot; or, when split as &quot;ma-jara&quot;, &quot;my lover&quot;. Gautama laughs and curses her to be turned into stone, but decrees that she will be released by Rama since she at least spoke the truth.
The petrification motif also appears in non-scriptural works. The &quot;Raghuvamsa&quot; of Kalidasa (generally dated 4th century CE) notes that the wife of Gautama (unnamed here) momentarily becomes the wife of Indra. Without explicitly mentioning the curse, it relates further that she regains her beautiful form and casts away her stony appearance, owing to the grace provided by the dust of Rama&#x27;s feet, which redeems her. Gautam Patel, author of many works about Kalidasa, credits him as the first person to introduce the petrification motif. In the &quot;Ramavataram&quot; too, Rama does not have to touch Ahalya with his foot; the dust from his feet is enough to bring her back to life. As in other versions of the tale, the repentant Ahalya is turned to stone, only to be liberated by Rama, and Indra runs away disguised as a cat but is cursed to bear the marks of a thousand vulvae. The &quot;Ramavataram&quot; is an example of the Bhakti-era poets who exalt Rama as a saviour.

Although opinions differ on whether the &quot;Bala Kanda&quot; narrative of Ahalya refers to the divinity of Rama, later sources assert Rama&#x27;s divine status, portraying Ahalya as a condemned woman rescued by God. The Bhakti-era poets use the episode as an archetypal example to demonstrate God&#x27;s saving grace. The main theme of such narratives is her deliverance by Rama, which is seen as proof of his compassion.

Most of the fifth chapter of the &quot;Bala Kanda&quot; Book of the &quot;Adhyatma Ramayana&quot; (embedded in the &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot;, c. 14th century) is dedicated to the Ahalya episode. Like most other versions of the story, Ahalya is turned into stone and advised to engross herself in meditation of Rama, &quot;the Supreme Lord&quot;. When Rama touches the stone with his foot on Vishvamitra&#x27;s advice, Ahalya rises as a beautiful maiden and sings a long panegyric dedicated to Rama. She describes his iconographic form and exalts him as an avatar of Vishnu and source of the universe to whom many divinities pay their respects. After worshipping him, she returns to Gautama. At the end of the narrative, Ahalya&#x27;s hymn is prescribed as an ideal benediction for a devotee to gain Rama&#x27;s favour. The Awadhi &quot;Ramacharitamanasa&quot; (16th century) drops the narrative of Indra&#x27;s visit to Ahalya. In this epic, Vishvamitra tells Rama that the cursed Ahalya has assumed the form of a rock and is patiently awaiting the dust from Rama&#x27;s feet. Ahalya tells Rama that Gautama was right to pronounce the curse, and she deems it as the greatest favour, for as a result, she feasted her eyes on Rama, who liberated her from her worldly existence. As in the &quot;Adhyatma Ramayana&quot;, Ahalya lauds Rama as the great Lord served by other divinities, asks for the boon of eternal engrossment in his devotion and afterwards leaves for her husband&#x27;s abode. The narrative ends with praise for Rama&#x27;s compassion. Tulsidas alludes to this episode numerous times in the &quot;Ramacharitamanasa&quot; while highlighting the significance of Rama&#x27;s benevolence. Commenting on this narrative in the &quot;Ramacharitamanasa&quot;, Rambhadracharya says that Rama destroyed three things: the sin of Ahalya by his sight, the curse by the dust of his feet and the affliction by the touch of his feet, evidenced by the use of the &quot;Tribhangi&quot; (meaning &quot;destroyer of the three&quot;) metre in the verses which form Ahalya&#x27;s panegyric.

=== Other variants ===

In some rare exceptions, the curse is dropped. In an instance in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, where details of the seduction are absent, an agitated Gautama orders his son Chirakari to behead his &quot;polluted&quot; mother and leaves the ashram. However, Chirakari is hesitant to follow the order and later concludes that Ahalya is innocent. Gautama returns and repents his hasty decision, realising that Indra is the guilty party. In the Bhil &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Gautama attacks and imprisons Indra, who is freed when he promises to shower rain on the crops as the rain god. He must also ensure that one quarter of the crops is dedicated to Gautama. Here, Ahalya is interpreted as dry and burnt land, eager for the rains sent by Indra, who is tamed by the wild cyclonic Gautama.

== Modern renditions ==

Ahalya has been examined in a new light by several modern writers, most commonly through short stories or through poetry in various Indian languages. Although Ahalya is a minor character in all ancient sources, &quot;stigmatised and despised by those around her&quot; for violating gender norms, modern Indian writers have elevated her to the status of an epic heroine, rather than an insignificant figure in the saga of Rama. However, in modern devotional &quot;Ramayana&quot; adaptations where Rama is the hero, the redemption of Ahalya continues to be a supernatural incident in his life.

Ahalya&#x27;s tale lives on in modern-day poetry, including works by Rabindranath Tagore in Bengali and English; P. T. Narasimhachar&#x27;s 1940 Kannada poetic drama, &quot;Ahalya&quot;, which weighs &quot;kama&quot; against &quot;dharma&quot; (pleasure against duty); and the works of the Sanskrit scholar and poet Chandra Rajan. It is retold numerous times in stage enactments as well as in film and television productions. Ahalya is a popular motif in the Mahari temple-dancer tradition of Odisha. Other works and genres of performance art that have been used to tell her story include the &quot;mohiniyattam&quot; dance of Kerala; &quot;Ahalyamoksham&quot;, a play by Kunchan Nambiar staged in the &quot;ottamthullal&quot; tradition; and &quot;Sati Ahalya&quot;, a &quot;padya-natakam&quot; drama from Andhra Pradesh.

Early in the 20th century, the old norms were reasserted. Pa. Subramania Mudaliar in his Tamil poem (1938) describes Ahalya lecturing Indra on chastity, but Indra&#x27;s lust compels him to rape her. Gautama turns Ahalya to stone to free her from the trauma. The Tamil writer Yogiyar portrays an innocent Ahalya, who sleeps with the disguised Indra, overcome with guilt and asking for punishment. Sripada Krishnamurty Sastry&#x27;s Telugu version of &quot;Ramayana&quot; (1947), one of the most censored versions of the tale, reduces Ahalya&#x27;s contact with Indra to a handshake.

Other authors reinterpreted the Ahalya legend from a very different perspective, often depicting Ahalya as a rebel and telling the story from her angle. R. K. Narayan (1906–2001) focuses on the psychological details of the story, reusing the old tale of Indra&#x27;s disguise as Gautama, his flight as a cat and Ahalya&#x27;s petrifaction. The theme of adulterous love is explored in Vishram Bedekar&#x27;s musical Marathi play &quot;Brahma Kumari&quot; (1933) and the Malayalam works of P. V. Ramavarier (1941) and M. Parvati Amma (1948). The Ahalya of the Tamil short story writer Ku Pa Rajagopalan (1902–44) also secretly longs for Indra and enjoys dalliance with him. Pratibha Ray&#x27;s Odia novel &quot;Mahamoha&quot; (1997, &quot;Great Lust&quot;) portrays an independent and nonconformist Ahalya as a tragic heroine, who offers herself to Indra so that he can fulfil his lust and she her womanhood. When Gautama persuades her to lie to society by claiming to have been raped, she debates chastity and freedom of mind with him.

Some writers try to imagine Ahalya&#x27;s life after the curse and redemption, a denouement which remains undisclosed in the ancient scriptures. Pudhumaipithan&#x27;s Tamil story &quot;Sapavimocanam&quot; (1943, &quot;Deliverance from the Curse&quot;) and K. B. Sreedevi&#x27;s Malayalam language work (1990) translated as &quot;Woman of Stone&quot; focus on Rama&#x27;s &quot;double standard&quot; from a feminist perspective. They ask why Rama frees Ahalya from being cursed for adultery, but punishes his wife Sita over false accusations of adultery with her kidnapper, Ravana. In Pudhumaipithan&#x27;s tale, Ahalya turns back into stone after hearing that Sita had to undergo a trial by fire to prove her chastity. Sreedevi portrays her turning into stone upon learning that Sita was banished from the kingdom on charges of adultery even after proving her chastity through the trial. Pudhumaipithan also narrates how, after the redemption, Ahalya suffers from &quot;post-trauma repetition syndrome&quot;, repeatedly re-experiencing Indra&#x27;s seduction and Gautama&#x27;s fury, as well as suffering the ire of a conservative society that rejects her. Gautama also suffers from self-recrimination at his hasty decision to curse Ahalya. In another story, &quot;Ahalya&quot; by Pudhumaipithan, Gautama forgives both Ahalya and Indra.

S. Sivasekaram&#x27;s 1980 Tamil poem &quot;Ahalikai&quot; examines the stone motif in Ahalya&#x27;s tale: she marries a husband who is no more interested in her than a stone and briefly encounters joy with Indra, only to end up cursed to become a lifeless stone. The poet asks if it was better for Ahalya to remain physically a stone and retain her dignity rather than return to a stony marriage. &quot;Uyir Maga&quot; (&quot;Life-woman&quot;) by the Tamil poet Na. Pichamurthy (1900–76) presents Ahalya as an allegorical representation of life, with Gautama as the mind and Indra pleasure. The Marxist critic Kovai Gnani, in his poem &quot;Kallihai&quot;, represents Ahalya as the oppressed class and Rama as an ideal future without exploitation. Gautama and Indra represent feudalism and capitalism. The character of Ahalya played by Kamala Kotnis in the 1949 movie &quot;Sati Ahalya&quot; (&quot;chaste Ahalya&quot;) was described as still relevant by contemporary film critics due to its portrayal of the predicament of a stained woman.

Love, sex and desire become important elements of the plot in Sant Singh Sekhon&#x27;s Punjabi play &quot;Kalakar&quot; (1945), which places the epic drama in the modern age. It depicts Ahalya as a free-spirited woman, who dares to be painted nude by Inder (Indra), a pupil of the art professor, Gautama, and defends her decision against her husband&#x27;s criticisms. N. S. Madhavan&#x27;s Malayalam story (April 2006) also retells Ahalya&#x27;s tale in a modern setting, wherein Ahalya, accused of adultery, is beaten by her husband, leaving her in a coma from which the neurologist, Rama, revives her. However, the practice of retelling the classical Ahalya–Indra tale in a contemporary setting is not new. The &quot;Yoga Vasistha&quot; (1001–1400) narrates a tale of two adulterous lovers, Queen Ahalya and the Brahmin Indra. Here, Ahalya and Indra fall in love and continue their affair, despite being punished by Ahalya&#x27;s jealous husband. After death, they reunite in their next birth. The 2015 short film &quot;Ahalya&quot; gives a feminist twist to the tale where the policeman Indra turns into a stone doll, after visiting Ahalya.

== Children ==
The &quot;Ramayana&quot; mentions Ahalya&#x27;s son, Shatananda (Satananda), the family priest and preceptor of King Janaka of Mithila. In this version, Shatananda asks Vishvamitra anxiously about the well-being of his &quot;renowned&quot; mother. By contrast, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; mentions two sons: Sharadvan, born with arrows in his hand, and Chirakari, whose extensive brooding over his actions leads to procrastination. Besides these, an unnamed daughter is also alluded to in the narrative. The &quot;Vamana Purana&quot; mentions three daughters: Jaya, Jayanti and Aparaji.

Another legend, generally told in Indian folk tales, states that Aruna, the charioteer of the sun-god Surya, once became a woman named Aruni and entered an assembly of celestial nymphs, where no man except Indra was allowed. Indra fell in love with Aruni and fathered a son named Vali. The next day, at Surya&#x27;s request, Aruna again assumed female form, and Surya fathered a son, Sugriva. Both children were given to Ahalya for rearing, but Gautama cursed them, causing them to turn into monkeys, as he did not like them. In the Thai version of the Ramayana, the &quot;Ramakien&quot;, Vali and Sugriva are described as Ahalya&#x27;s children from her liaisons with Indra and Surya. Although Ahalya initially passes them off as sons of Gautama, her daughter by Gautama – Anjani – reveals her mother&#x27;s secret to her father. He consequently drives the brothers away and curses them to become monkeys. Enraged, Ahalya curses Anjani to give birth to a monkey too. Anjani bears Hanuman, the monkey-god and friend of Rama. Similar tales are also found in the Malay adaptation, &quot;Hikayat Seri Rama&quot;, and Punjabi and Gujarati folk tales. However, Anjani is cursed by Gautama in these versions, generally for aiding Indra and Ahalya in concealing the secret.

Some Tamil castes trace their ancestry to Ahalya and Indra&#x27;s liaison; the castes are named after Ahalya&#x27;s children. Gautama finds the three boys and names them according to their behaviour: Agamudayar (derived from &quot;brave&quot;), who confronts Gautama, Maravar (derived from &quot;tree&quot;), who climbs a tree and Kallar (derived from &quot;thief&quot; or &quot;rock&quot;), who hides like a thief behind a large rock. A fourth child, Vellala, is added in some versions. In another variant, the liaison is replaced by penance and worship offered by Ahalya to Indra, who gifts her the children as a reward.

== Assessment and remembrance ==

A well-known verse about Ahalya runs:

&lt;poem&gt;
Sanskrit transliteration
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
English translation
Ahalya, Draupadi, Kunti, Tara and Mandodari
One should forever remember the five virgins who are the destroyers of great sins
&lt;/poem&gt;


Orthodox Hindus, especially Hindu wives, remember the &quot;panchakanya&quot;, the five virgins or maidens, in this daily morning prayer. One view considers them &quot;exemplary chaste women&quot; or &quot;mahasati&quot;s (&quot;great chaste women&quot;) as per the Mahari dance tradition, and worthy as an ideal for &quot;displaying some outstanding quality&quot;. According to this view, Ahalya is the &quot;epitome of the chaste wife, unjustly accused of adultery&quot;, while her &quot;proverbial loyalty to her husband&quot; makes her venerable. Ahalya is often regarded as the leader of the &quot;panchkanya&quot; due to the &quot;nobility of her character, her extraordinary beauty and the fact of her being chronologically the first &quot;kanya&quot;&quot;. In the &quot;Devi-Bhagavata Purana&quot;, Ahalya is included in a list of secondary goddesses, who are &quot;auspicious, glorious and much praiseworthy&quot;, alongside Tara and Mandodari as well as some of the &quot;pancha-sati&quot;s (&quot;five &quot;sati&quot;s or chaste wives&quot;) Arundhati and Damayanti.

Another view does not regard the &quot;panchakanya&quot; as ideal women who should be emulated. Bhattacharya, author of &quot;Panch-Kanya: The Five Virgins of Indian Epics&quot; contrasts the &quot;panchakanya&quot; with the five &quot;sati&quot;s enlisted in another traditional prayer: Sati, Sita, Savitri, Damayanti and Arundhati. He rhetorically asks, &quot;Are then Ahalya, Draupadi, Kunti, Tara, and Mandodari &quot;not&quot; chaste wives because each has &#x27;known&#x27; a man, or more than &quot;one&quot;, other than her husband?&quot; Because they exhibited sexual behaviours that were non-ideal and even unethical according to traditional norms, Indian social reformer Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay was perplexed by the inclusion of Ahalya and Tara in the &quot;panchakanya&quot;. Although Ahalya&#x27;s transgression blemished her and denied her the high status and reverence accorded to women like Sita and Savitri, this action made her immortal in legend.

The place where Ahalya is held to have practised her penance and was redeemed has been celebrated in scriptures as a sacred place called the &quot;Ahalya-tirtha&quot;. A &quot;tirtha&quot; is a sacred place with a body of water, where pilgrims generally bathe to purify themselves. The location of the &quot;Ahalya-tirtha&quot; is disputed: according to some scriptures, it is on the river Godavari, others place it on the river Narmada. Two sites are widely held to be the &quot;Ahalya-tirtha&quot;. One is located near Ahalyeshvara Temple in Bhalod, on the banks of the Narmada; another is located in Darbhanga district, Bihar. The &quot;Ahilya Asthan&quot; temple in &quot;Ahalya-gram&quot; (&quot;Ahalya&#x27;s village&quot;) in the same district is dedicated to Ahalya. For those seeking to attract women and be handsome like the love-god Kamadeva, the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; and the &quot;Kurma Purana&quot; prescribe the worship of Ahalya at the &quot;Ahalya-tirtha&quot;. This is to be done on the day of Kamadeva, in the Hindu month of Chaitra. According to the texts, he who bathes in the &quot;tirtha&quot; will enjoy pleasure with the celestial nymphs.

For Bhattacharya, Ahalya is the eternal woman who responds to her inner urges and the advances of the divine ruler, a direct contrast to her ascetic husband, who did not satisfy her carnal desire. The author regards Ahalya as an independent woman who makes her own decisions, takes risks and is driven by curiosity to experiment with the extraordinary and then accept the curse imposed on her by patriarchal society. It is this undaunted acceptance of the curse that makes the &quot;Ramayana&quot; praise and venerate her. V. R. Devika, author of &quot;Ahalya: Scarlet Letter&quot;, asks, &quot;So is it right to condemn adultery and physical encounters as modern afflictions and against our [Indian/Hindu] culture? Or do we learn from Ahalya who made a conscious choice to fulfil her need and yet has been extolled?&quot;

Like Bhattacharya, Meena Kelkar, author of &quot;Subordination of Woman: a New Perspective&quot;, feels that Ahalya was made venerable due to her acceptance of gender norms; she ungrudgingly accepted the curse while acknowledging her need for punishment. However, Kelkar adds that another reason for making Ahalya immortal in scripture could be that her punishment acts as a warning and deterrent to women. Patriarchal society always condemns Ahalya as a fallen woman. In Bhavabhuti&#x27;s 8th-century play &quot;Mahaviracharita&quot;, which alludes to Ahalya&#x27;s redemption in a verbal spat with Parashurama, Satananda is mocked as the son of Ahalya, the adulteress. Jaya Srinivasan, in her discourses on tales from the Hindu epics, says that though Ahalya&#x27;s action was &quot;unpardonable&quot;, she was redeemed by the divine touch of dust from Rama&#x27;s feet. Jaya adds that Ahalya&#x27;s actions and the resultant curse are a warning that such immoral behaviour leads to doom, although sincere penitence and complete surrender to God can erase the gravest sins. In Hindu Tamil weddings in India and Sri Lanka, Ahalya appears as a symbolic black grinding stone, which the bride touches with her foot while promising not to be like Ahalya. The bride is also shown the star associated with the chaste Arundhati, who is cast as her ideal. The well-known treatise on sexual behaviour, the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; (301–600), also mentions Ahalya and Indra while discussing how lust destroys men. However, it also urges men to seduce women by telling the romantic tales of Ahalya. The sixth-century Tamil epic &quot;Manimekalai&quot; alludes to her tale warning how the gods also do not remain untouched by illicit love.

The right-wing Hindu women&#x27;s organisation Rashtra Sevika Samiti considers Ahalya the symbol of &quot;Hindu woman&#x27;s (and Hindu society&#x27;s) rape by the outsider&quot;, especially British colonisers and Muslim invaders, but also Hindu men. The feminist writer Tarabai Shinde (1850–1910) writes that the scriptures, by depicting gods such as Indra who exploit chaste wives such as Ahalya, are responsible for promoting immoral ways; she asks why so much importance is then given to &quot;pativrata dharma&quot;, the devotion and fidelity to the husband which is said to be the ultimate duty of a wife.

A similar tale of divine seduction appears in Greek mythology, where Zeus, a king-of-the-gods figure akin to Indra, seduces Alcmene by assuming the form of her husband, resulting in the birth of the legendary hero Heracles. Like Ahalya, Alcmene falls victim to Zeus&#x27;s trickery in some versions or, recognising his true identity, proceeds with the affair in others. The main difference between the tales is that the &quot;raison-d&#x27;être&quot; of Alcmene&#x27;s seduction is the justification of Heracles&#x27;s divine parentage, so she is never condemned as an adulteress or punished; in contrast, Ahalya faces the ire of the scriptures as her encounter is regarded as purely erotic (not resulting in procreation).
