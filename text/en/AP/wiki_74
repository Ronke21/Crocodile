<text>Dell Inc. is an American technology company that develops, sells, repairs, and supports personal computers (PCs), servers, data storage devices, network switches, software, computer peripherals including printers and webcams among other products and services. Dell is based in Round Rock, Texas.

Founded by Michael Dell in 1984, Dell started making IBM clone computers and pioneered selling cut-price PCs directly to customers, managing its supply chain and electronic commerce. The company rose rapidly during the 1990s and in 2001 it became the largest global PC vendor for the first time. Dell was a pure hardware vendor until 2009 when it acquired Perot Systems. Dell then entered the market for IT services. The company has expanded storage and networking systems. In the late 2000s, it began expanding from offering computers only to delivering a range of technology for enterprise customers.

Dell is a subsidiary of Dell Technologies, a publicly traded company, as well as a component of the NASDAQ-100 and S&amp;P 500. Dell is ranked 31st on the Fortune 500 list in 2022, up from 76th in 2021. It is also the sixth-largest company in Texas by total revenue, according to &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine. It is the second-largest non-oil company in Texas. it is the world&#x27;s third-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales, after Lenovo and HP. In 2015, Dell acquired the enterprise technology firm EMC Corporation, together becoming divisions of Dell Technologies. Dell EMC sells data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, and cloud computing.

==History==

===Founding and start-up===

Michael Dell founded Dell Computer Corporation, doing business as &quot;PC&#x27;s Limited&quot; in 1984 while a student at the University of Texas at Austin, operating from Michael Dell&#x27;s off-campus dormitory room at Dobie Center. The start-up aimed to sell IBM PC compatible computers built from stock components. Michael Dell started trading in the belief that, by selling personal computer systems directly to customers, PC&#x27;s Limited could better understand customers&#x27; needs and provide the most effective computing services to meet those needs. Dell dropped out of college upon completion of his freshman year at the University of Texas in order to focus full-time on his fledgling business, after getting about $1,000 in expansion-capital from his family. As of April 2021, Dell&#x27;s net worth was estimated to be over $50 billion ().

In 1985, PC&#x27;s Limited launched its first computer, the &quot;Turbo PC,&quot; priced at US$795 (). The Turbo PC featured an Intel 8088-compatible processor with a maximum speed of 8 MHz. PC&#x27;s Limited marketed these systems through national computer magazines, selling directly to consumers while custom-assembling each unit based on a range of options. This approach allowed them to offer competitive prices compared to retail brands, coupled with the convenience of pre-assembled units, making them one of the early success stories of this business model. The company grossed over $73 million in its first year of operation.
The company dropped the &quot;PC&#x27;s Limited&quot; name in 1987 to become Dell Computer Corporation and began expanding globally. The reasoning was that this new company name better reflected its presence in the business market, and also resolved issues with the use of &quot;Limited&quot; in a company name in certain countries. The company set up its first international operations in Britain; 11 more followed within the next four years. In June 1988, Dell Computer&#x27;s market capitalization grew by $30 million to $80 million () from its June 22 initial public offering of 3.5 million shares at $8.50 a share. In 1989, Dell Computer set up its first on-site service programs in order to compensate for the lack of local retailers prepared to act as service centers.

===Growth in the 1990s and early 2000s===

In 1990, Dell Computer tried selling its products indirectly through warehouse clubs and computer superstores, but met with little success, and the company re-focused on its more successful direct-to-consumer sales model. In 1992, &quot;Fortune&quot; included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world&#x27;s 500 largest companies, making Michael Dell the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company at that time.

In 1993, to complement its own direct sales channel, Dell planned to sell PCs at big-box retail outlets such as Wal-Mart, which would have brought in an additional $125 million () in annual revenue. Bain consultant Kevin Rollins persuaded Michael Dell to pull out of these deals, believing they would be money losers in the long run. Margins at retail were thin at best and Dell left the reseller channel in 1994. Rollins would soon join Dell full-time and eventually become the company president and CEO.

Originally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed when the company&#x27;s Internet site took off in 1996 and 1997. While the industry&#x27;s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell&#x27;s was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.

From 1997 to 2004, Dell steadily grew and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps. During the same period, rival PC vendors such as Compaq, Gateway, IBM, Packard Bell, and AST Research struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out. Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999. Operating costs made up only 10 percent of Dell&#x27;s $35 billion in revenue in 2002 (), compared with 21 percent of revenue at Hewlett-Packard, 25 percent at Gateway, and 46 percent at Cisco. In 2002, when Compaq merged with Hewlett-Packard (the fourth-place PC maker), the newly combined Hewlett-Packard took the top spot for a time but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead. Dell grew the fastest in the early 2000s.

In 2002, Dell expanded its product line to include televisions, handhelds, digital audio players, and printers. Chairman and CEO Michael Dell had repeatedly blocked President and COO Kevin Rollins&#x27;s attempt to lessen the company&#x27;s heavy dependency on PCs, which Rollins wanted to fix by acquiring EMC Corporation; a move that would eventually occur over 12 years later.

In 2003, at the annual company meeting, the stockholders approved changing the company name to &quot;Dell Inc.&quot; to recognize the company&#x27;s expansion beyond computers.

In 2004, the company announced that it would build a new assembly-plant near Winston-Salem, North Carolina; the city and county provided Dell with $37.2 million in incentive packages; the state provided approximately $250 million () in incentives and tax breaks. In July, Michael Dell stepped aside as chief executive officer while retaining his position as chairman of the board. Kevin Rollins, who had held a number of executive posts at Dell, became the new CEO. Despite no longer holding the CEO title, Dell essentially acted as a de facto co-CEO with Rollins.

Under Rollins, Dell purchased the computer hardware manufacturer Alienware in 2006. Dell Inc.&#x27;s plan anticipated Alienware continuing to operate independently under its existing management. Alienware expected to benefit from Dell&#x27;s efficient manufacturing system.

=== Key events ===

In 2005, while earnings and sales continued to rise, sales growth slowed considerably, and the company stock lost 25% of its value that year. By June 2006, the stock traded around US$25 which was 40% down from July 2005—the high-water mark of the company in the post-dotcom era. By June 2021, the stock had reached an all-time high of over US$100 per share, reflecting the company&#x27;s successful transition to a technology service provider that helps customers navigate digital transformation.

The slowing sales growth has been attributed to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell&#x27;s sales, and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC business segments such as storage, services, and servers. Dell&#x27;s price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs, but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company&#x27;s supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell&#x27;s traditional price differentiation. Throughout the entire PC industry, declines in prices along with commensurate increases in performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to upsell to their customers. As a result, the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins. The laptop segment had become the fastest-growing of the PC market, but Dell produced low-cost notebooks in China like other PC manufacturers which eliminated Dell&#x27;s manufacturing cost advantages, plus Dell&#x27;s reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing notebook sales in big box stores. &quot;CNET&quot; has suggested that Dell was getting trapped in the increasing commoditization of high volume low margin computers, which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded.

Despite plans of expanding into other global regions and product segments, Dell was heavily dependent on US corporate PC market, as desktop PCs sold to both commercial and corporate customers accounted for 32 percent of its revenue, 85 percent of its revenue comes from businesses, and 64 percent of its revenue comes from North and South America, according to its 2006 third-quarter results. US shipments of desktop PCs were shrinking, and the corporate PC market, which purchases PCs in upgrade cycles, had largely decided to take a break from buying new systems. The last cycle started around 2002, three or so years after companies started buying PCs ahead of the perceived Y2K problems, and corporate clients were not expected to upgrade again until extensive testing of Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Vista (expected in early 2007), putting the next upgrade cycle around 2008. Heavily dependent on PCs, Dell had to slash prices to boost sales volumes, while demanding deep cuts from suppliers.

Dell had long stuck by its direct sales model. Consumers had become the main drivers of PC sales in recent years, yet there had a decline in consumers purchasing PCs through the Web or on the phone, as increasing numbers were visiting consumer electronics retail stores to try out the devices first. Dell&#x27;s rivals in the PC industry, HP, Gateway and Acer, had a long retail presence and so were well poised to take advantage of the consumer shift. The lack of a retail presence stymied Dell&#x27;s attempts to offer consumer electronics such as flat-panel TVs and MP3 players. Dell responded by experimenting with mall kiosks, plus quasi-retail stores in Texas and New York.

Dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon supply chain efficiencies to sell established technologies at low prices, instead of being an innovator. By the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector. Dell&#x27;s low spending on R&amp;D relative to its revenue (compared to IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Apple Inc.)—which worked well in the commoditized PC market—prevented it from making inroads into more lucrative segments, such as MP3 players and later mobile devices. Increasing spending on R&amp;D would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized. Dell had done well with a horizontal organization that focused on PCs when the computing industry moved to horizontal mix-and-match layers in the 1980s, but by the mid-2000 the industry shifted to vertically integrated stacks to deliver an end-to-end IT product, and Dell lagged far behind competitors like Hewlett-Packard and Oracle.

Dell&#x27;s reputation for poor customer service, which was exacerbated as it moved call centers offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure, came under increasing scrutiny on the Web. The original Dell model was known for high customer satisfaction when PCs sold for thousands of dollars but by the 2000s, the company could not justify that level of service when computers in the same line-up sold for hundreds of dollars. Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from the head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell&#x27;s DNA of cost-cutting &quot;got in the way,&quot; aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve on this and rolled out &quot;DellConnect&quot; to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional &quot;bloatware&quot; on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the &quot;Dell Hell&quot; prominent on Internet search engines.

There was also criticism that Dell used faulty components for its PCs, particularly the 11.8 million OptiPlex desktop computers sold to businesses and governments from May 2003 to July 2005 that suffered from faulty capacitors. A battery recall in August 2006, as a result of a Dell laptop catching fire, caused much negative attention for the company though later, Sony was found responsible for the manufacturing of the batteries, however a Sony spokesman said the problem concerned the combination of the battery with a charger, which was specific to Dell.

2006 marked the first year that Dell&#x27;s growth was slower than the PC industry as a whole. By the fourth quarter of 2006, Dell lost its title of the largest PC manufacturer to Hewlett Packard whose Personal Systems Group was invigorated thanks to a restructuring initiated by their CEO Mark Hurd.

====SEC investigation====
In August 2005, Dell became the subject of an informal investigation by the United States SEC. In 2006, the company disclosed that the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York had subpoenaed documents related to the company&#x27;s financial reporting dating back to 2002. The company delayed filing financial reports for the third and fourth fiscal quarter of 2006, and several class-action lawsuits were filed. Dell Inc&#x27;s failure to file its quarterly earnings report could have subjected the company to de-listing from the Nasdaq, but the exchange granted Dell a waiver, allowing the stock to trade normally. In August 2007, the company announced that it would restate its earnings for fiscal years 2003 through 2006 and the first quarter of 2007 after an internal audit found that certain employees had changed corporate account balances to meet quarterly financial targets. In July 2010, the SEC announced charges against several senior Dell executives, including Dell Chairman and CEO Michael Dell, former CEO Kevin Rollins, and former CFO James Schneider, &quot;with failing to disclose material information to investors and using fraudulent accounting to make it falsely appear that the company was consistently meeting Wall Street earnings targets and reducing its operating expenses.&quot; Dell, inc. was fined $100 million, with Michael Dell personally fined $4 million.

====Michael Dell resumes CEO role====
After four out of five quarterly earnings reports were below expectations, Rollins resigned as president and CEO on January 31, 2007, and founder Michael Dell assumed the role of CEO again.

On March 1, 2007, the company issued a preliminary quarterly earnings report showing gross sales of $14.4 billion, down 5% year-over-year, and net income of $687 million (30 cents per share), down 33%. Net earnings would have declined even more if not for the effects of eliminated employee bonuses, which accounted for six cents per share. NASDAQ extended the company&#x27;s deadline for filing financials to May 4.

===Dell 2.0 and downsizing===
Dell announced a change campaign called &quot;Dell 2.0,&quot; reducing the number of employees and diversifying the company&#x27;s products. While chairman of the board after relinquishing his CEO position, Michael Dell still had significant input in the company during Rollins&#x27; years as CEO. With the return of Michael Dell as CEO, the company saw changes in operations, the exodus of many senior vice-presidents and new personnel brought in from outside the company. Michael Dell announced a number of initiatives and plans (part of the &quot;Dell 2.0&quot; initiative) to improve the company&#x27;s financial performance. These include elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards, reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to Michael Dell from 20 to 12, and reduction of &quot;bureaucracy&quot;. Jim Schneider retired as CFO and was replaced by Donald Carty, as the company came under an SEC probe for its accounting practices.

On April 23, 2008, Dell announced the closure of one of its biggest Canadian call-centers in Kanata, Ontario, terminating approximately 1100 employees, with 500 of those redundancies effective on the spot, and with the official closure of the center scheduled for the summer. The call-center had opened in 2006 after the city of Ottawa won a bid to host it. Less than a year later, Dell planned to double its workforce to nearly 3,000 workers add a new building. These plans were reversed, due to a high Canadian dollar that made the Ottawa staff relatively expensive, and also as part of Dell&#x27;s turnaround, which involved moving these call-center jobs offshore to cut costs.
The company had also announced the shutdown of its Edmonton, Alberta, office, losing 900 jobs. In total, Dell announced the ending of about 8,800 jobs in 2007–2008 — 10% of its workforce.

By the late 2000s, Dell&#x27;s &quot;configure to order&quot; approach of manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications from its US facilities was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers as PCs became powerful low-cost commodities. Dell closed plants that produced desktop computers for the North American market, including the Mort Topfer Manufacturing Center in Austin, Texas (original location) and Lebanon, Tennessee (opened in 1999) in 2008 and early 2009, respectively. The desktop production plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, received US$280 million in incentives from the state and opened in 2005 (), but ceased operations in November 2010. Dell&#x27;s contract with the state required them to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions, and they sold the North Carolina plant to Herbalife. Much work was transferred to manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell&#x27;s own factories overseas. On January 8, 2009, Dell announced the closure of its manufacturing plant in Limerick, Ireland, with the loss of 1,900 jobs and the transfer of production to its plant in Łodź in Poland.

===Attempts at diversification===

The release of Apple&#x27;s iPad tablet computer had a negative impact on Dell and other major PC vendors, as consumers switched away from desktop and laptop PCs. Dell&#x27;s own mobility division has not managed success with developing smartphones or tablets, whether running Windows or Google Android. The Dell Streak was a failure commercially and critically due to its outdated OS, numerous bugs, and low resolution screen. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; suggested that Dell and other OEMs saw tablets as a short-term, low-investment opportunity running Google Android, an approach that neglected user interface and failed to gain long term market traction with consumers. Dell has responded by pushing higher-end PCs, such as the XPS line of notebooks, which do not compete with the Apple iPad and Kindle Fire tablets. The growing popularity of smartphones and tablet computers instead of PCs drove Dell&#x27;s consumer segment to an operating loss in Q3 2012. In December 2012, Dell suffered its first decline in holiday sales in five years, despite the introduction of Windows 8.

In the shrinking PC industry, Dell continued to lose market share, as it dropped below Lenovo in 2011 to fall to number three in the world. Dell and fellow American contemporary Hewlett Packard came under pressure from Asian PC manufacturers Lenovo, Asus, and Acer, all of which had lower production costs and were willing to accept lower profit margins. In addition, while the Asian PC vendors had been improving their quality and design—for instance, Lenovo&#x27;s ThinkPad series was winning corporate customers away from Dell&#x27;s laptops—Dell&#x27;s customer service and reputation had been slipping. Dell remained the second-most profitable PC vendor, as it took 13 percent of operating profits in the PC industry during Q4 2012, behind Apple&#x27;s Mac that took 45 percent, seven percent at Hewlett Packard, six percent at Lenovo and Asus, and one percent for Acer.

Dell attempted to offset its declining PC business, which still accounted for half of its revenue and generates steady cash flow, by expanding into the enterprise market with servers, networking, software, and services. It avoided many of the acquisition write-downs and management turnover that plagued its chief rival Hewlett Packard. Despite spending $13 billion on acquisitions to diversify its portfolio beyond hardware, the company was unable to convince the market that it could thrive or made the transformation in the post-PC world, as it suffered continued declines in revenue and share price. Dell&#x27;s market share in the corporate segment was previously a &quot;moat&quot; against rivals but this has no longer been the case as sales and profits have fallen precipitously.

===2013 buyout===
After several weeks of rumors, which started around January 11, 2013, Dell announced on February 5, 2013, that it had struck a $24.4 billion () leveraged buyout deal, that would have delisted its shares from the NASDAQ and Hong Kong Stock Exchange and taken it private. Reuters reported that Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners, aided by a $2 billion loan from Microsoft, would acquire the public shares at $13.65 apiece. The $24.4 billion buyout was projected to be the largest leveraged buyout backed by private equity since the 2007–2008 financial crisis (). It is also the largest technology buyout ever, surpassing the 2006 buyout of Freescale Semiconductor for $17.5 billion ().

Michael Dell said of the February offer &quot;I believe this transaction will open an exciting new chapter for Dell, our customers and team members&quot;. Dell rival Lenovo responded to the buyout, saying, &quot;the financial actions of some of our traditional competitors will not substantially change our outlook.&quot;

In March 2013, the Blackstone Group and Carl Icahn expressed interest in purchasing Dell. In April 2013, Blackstone withdrew their offer, citing deteriorating business. Other private equity firms such as KKR &amp; Co. and TPG Capital declined to submit alternative bids for Dell, citing the uncertain market for personal computers and competitive pressures, so the &quot;wide-open bidding war&quot; never materialized. Analysts said that the biggest challenge facing Silver Lake would be to find an &quot;exit strategy&quot; to profit from its investment, which would be when the company would hold an IPO to go public again, and one warned &quot;But even if you can get a $25bn enterprise value for Dell, it will take years to get out.&quot;

In May 2013, Michael Dell joined his board in voting for the offer. The following August he reached a deal with the special committee on the board for $13.88 per share, a raised price of $13.75 plus a special dividend of 13 cents, as well as a change to the voting rules. The $13.88 cash offer (plus a $.08 per share dividend for the third fiscal quarter) was accepted on September 12 and closed on October 30, 2013, ending Dell&#x27;s 25-year run as a publicly traded company.

After the buyout, the newly private Dell offered a Voluntary Separation Program that they expected to reduce their workforce by up to seven percent. The reception to the program so exceeded the expectations that Dell may be forced to hire new staff to make up for the losses.

===Recent history===
On November 19, 2015, Dell, alongside Arm Holdings, Cisco Systems, Intel, Microsoft, and Princeton University, founded the OpenFog Consortium, to promote interests and development in fog computing.

====Acquisition of EMC====
On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire EMC Corporation in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $67 billion (), which has been considered the largest-ever acquisition in the technology sector. As part of the acquisition, Dell would take over EMC&#x27;s 81% stake in the cloud-computing and virtualization company VMware. This would combine Dell&#x27;s enterprise server, personal computer, and mobile businesses with EMC&#x27;s enterprise storage business in a significant Vertical merger of IT giants. Dell would pay $24.05 per share of EMC, and $9.05 per share of tracking stock in VMware.

The announcement came two years after Dell Inc. returned to private ownership, claiming that it faced bleak prospects and would need several years out of the public eye to rebuild its business. It was thought that the company&#x27;s value had roughly doubled since then. EMC was being pressured by Elliott Management, a hedge fund holding 2.2% of EMC&#x27;s stock, to reorganize their unusual &quot;Federation&quot; structure, in which EMC&#x27;s divisions were effectively being run as independent companies. Elliott argued this structure deeply undervalued EMC&#x27;s core &quot;EMC II&quot; data storage business, and that increasing competition between EMC II and VMware products was confusing the market and hindering both companies. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; estimated that in 2014 Dell had revenue of $27.3 billion () from personal computers and $8.9 billion from servers, while EMC had $16.5 billion from EMC II, $1 billion from RSA Security, $6 billion from VMware, and $230 million from Pivotal Software. EMC owns around 80 percent of the stock of VMware. The proposed acquisition will maintain VMware as a separate company, held via a new tracking stock, while the other parts of EMC will be rolled into Dell. Once the acquisition closes Dell will again publish quarterly financial results, having ceased these on going private in 2013.

The combined business was expected to address the markets for scale-out architecture, converged infrastructure and private cloud computing, playing to the strengths of both EMC and Dell. Commentators have questioned the deal, with FBR Capital Markets saying that though it makes a &quot;ton of sense&quot; for Dell, it&#x27;s a &quot;nightmare scenario that would lack strategic synergies&quot; for EMC. &quot;Fortune&quot; said there was a lot for Dell to like in EMC&#x27;s portfolio, but &quot;does it all add up enough to justify tens of billions of dollars for the entire package? Probably not.&quot; &quot;The Register&quot; reported the view of William Blair &amp; Company that the merger would &quot;blow up the current IT chess board&quot;, forcing other IT infrastructure vendors to restructure to achieve scale and vertical integration. The value of VMware stock fell 10% after the announcement, valuing the deal at around $63–64bn rather than the $67bn originally reported. Key investors backing the deal besides Dell were Singapore&#x27;s Temasek Holdings and Silver Lake Partners.

On September 7, 2016, Dell completed the merger with EMC, which involved the issuance of $45.9 billion () in debt and $4.4 billion () of common stock. At the time, some analysts claimed that Dell&#x27;s acquisition of the former Iomega could harm the LenovoEMC partnership.

In July 2018, Dell announced intentions to become a publicly traded company again by paying $21.7 billion () in both cash and stock to buy back shares from its stake in VMware, offering shareholders roughly 60 cents on the dollar as part of the deal. In November, Carl Icahn (9.3% owner of Dell) sued the company over plans to go public. As a result of pressure from Icahn and other activist investors, Dell renegotiated the deal, ultimately offering shareholders about 80% of market value. As part of this deal, Dell once again became a public company, with the original Dell computer business and Dell EMC operating under the newly created parent, Dell Technologies.

Post-acquisition, Dell was re-organized with a new parent company, Dell Technologies; Dell&#x27;s consumer and workstation businesses are internally referred to as the Dell Client Solutions Group, and is one of the company&#x27;s three main business divisions alongside Dell EMC and VMware.

In January 2021 (), Dell reported $94 billion () in sales and $13 billion operating cash flow during 2020.

On March 1, 2024, Dell&#x27;s stock hit all-time high after earnings. It delivered a strong performance from its artificial intelligence unit that sent shares up nearly 40%, its highest daily gain since the company went public in 2018. In August 2024, the company announced it would be laying off 12,500 employees—10% of its workforce—in order to invest in artificial intelligence initiatives.

=== Dell and AMD ===
When Dell acquired Alienware early in 2006, some Alienware systems had AMD chips. On August 17, 2006, a Dell press release stated that starting in September, Dell Dimension desktop computers would have AMD processors and that later in the year Dell would release a two-socket, quad-processor server using AMD Opteron chips, moving away from Dell&#x27;s tradition of only offering Intel processors in Dell PCs.

CNET&#x27;s News.com on August 17, 2006, cited Dell&#x27;s CEO Kevin Rollins as attributing the move to AMD processors to lower costs and to AMD technology. AMD&#x27;s senior VP in commercial business, Marty Seyer, stated: &quot;Dell&#x27;s wider embrace of AMD processor-based offerings is a win for Dell, for the industry and most importantly for Dell customers.&quot;

On October 23, 2006, Dell announced new AMD-based servers — the PowerEdge 6950 and the PowerEdge SC1435.

On November 1, 2006, Dell&#x27;s website began offering notebooks based on AMD processors (the Inspiron 1501 with a display) with the choice of a single-core MK-36 processor, dual-core Turion X2 chips or Mobile Sempron.

In 2017, Dell released the AlienWare 17 gaming laptop. The model was primarily based on NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 systems.

=== Dell and desktop Linux ===
In 1998, Ralph Nader asked Dell (and five other major OEMs) to offer alternate operating systems to Microsoft Windows, specifically including Linux, for which &quot;there is clearly a growing interest&quot;. Possibly coincidentally, Dell started offering Linux notebook systems that &quot;cost no more than their Windows 98 counterparts&quot; in 2000, and soon expanded, with Dell becoming &quot;the first major manufacturer to offer Linux across its full product line&quot;. However, by early 2001 Dell had &quot;disbanded its Linux business unit.&quot;

On February 26, 2007, Dell announced that it had commenced a program to sell and distribute a range of computers with pre-installed Linux distributions as an alternative to Microsoft Windows. Dell indicated that Novell&#x27;s SUSE Linux would appear first. However, the next day, Dell announced that its previous announcement related to certifying the hardware as ready to work with Novell SUSE Linux and that it (Dell) had no plans to sell systems pre-installed with Linux in the near future. On March 28, 2007, Dell announced that it would begin shipping some desktops and laptops with Linux pre-installed, although it did not specify which distribution of Linux or which hardware would lead. On April 18, a report appeared suggesting that Michael Dell used Ubuntu on one of his home systems. On May 1, 2007, Dell announced it would ship the Ubuntu Linux distribution. On May 24, 2007, Dell started selling models with Ubuntu Linux 7.04 pre-installed: a laptop, a budget computer, and a high-end PC.

On June 27, 2007, Dell announced on its Direct2Dell blog that it planned to offer more pre-loaded systems (the new Dell Inspiron desktops and laptops). After the IdeaStorm site supported extending the bundles beyond the US market, Dell later announced more international marketing. On August 7, 2007, Dell officially announced that it would offer one notebook and one desktop in the UK, France and Germany with Ubuntu &quot;pre-installed&quot;. At LinuxWorld 2007 Dell announced plans to provide Novell&#x27;s SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop on selected models in China, &quot;factory-installed&quot;. On November 30, 2007, Dell reported shipping 40,000 Ubuntu PCs. On January 24, 2008, Dell in Germany, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom launched a second laptop, an XPS M1330 with Ubuntu 7.10, for 849 euro or GBP 599 upwards. On February 18, 2008, Dell announced that the Inspiron 1525 would have Ubuntu as an optional operating system. On February 22, 2008, Dell announced plans to sell Ubuntu in Canada and in Latin America From September 16, 2008, Dell has shipped both Dell Ubuntu Netbook Remix and Windows XP Home versions of the Inspiron Mini 9 and the Inspiron Mini 12. Dell shipped the Inspiron Mini laptops with Ubuntu version 8.04.

As of 2021, Dell continues to offer select laptops and workstations with Ubuntu Linux pre-installed, under the &quot;Developer Edition&quot; moniker.

==Dell facilities==
Dell&#x27;s headquarters is located in Round Rock, Texas. the company employed about 14,000 people in central Texas and was the region&#x27;s largest private employer, which has of space. As of 1999 almost half of the general fund of the city of Round Rock originated from sales taxes generated from the Dell headquarters.

Dell previously had its headquarters in the Arboretum complex in northern Austin, Texas. In 1989 Dell occupied in the Arboretum complex. In 1990, Dell had 1,200 employees in its headquarters. In 1993, Dell submitted a document to Round Rock officials, titled &quot;Dell Computer Corporate Headquarters, Round Rock, Texas, May 1993 Schematic Design.&quot; Despite the filing, during that year the company said that it was not going to move its headquarters. In 1994, Dell announced that it was moving most of its employees out of the Arboretum, but that it was going to continue to occupy the top floor of the Arboretum and that the company&#x27;s official headquarters address would continue to be the Arboretum. The top floor continued to hold Dell&#x27;s board room, demonstration center, and visitor meeting room. Less than one month prior to August 29, 1994, Dell moved 1,100 customer support and telephone sales employees to Round Rock. Dell&#x27;s lease in the Arboretum had been scheduled to expire in 1994.
By 1996, Dell was moving its headquarters to Round Rock. As of January 1996, 3,500 people still worked at the current Dell headquarters. One building of the Round Rock headquarters, Round Rock 3, had space for 6,400 employees and was scheduled to be completed in November 1996. In 1998 Dell announced that it was going to add two buildings to its Round Rock complex, adding of office space to the complex.

In 2000, Dell announced that it would lease of space in the Las Cimas office complex in unincorporated Travis County, Texas, between Austin and West Lake Hills, to house the company&#x27;s executive offices and corporate headquarters. 100 senior executives were scheduled to work in the building by the end of 2000. In January 2001, the company leased the space in Las Cimas 2, located along Loop 360. Las Cimas 2 housed Dell&#x27;s executives, the investment operations, and some corporate functions. Dell also had an option for of space in Las Cimas 3. After a slowdown in business required reducing employees and production capacity, Dell decided to sublease its offices in two buildings in the Las Cimas office complex. In 2002 Dell announced that it planned to sublease its space to another tenant; the company planned to move its headquarters back to Round Rock once a tenant was secured. By 2003, Dell moved its headquarters back to Round Rock. It leased all of Las Cimas I and II, with a total of , for about a seven-year period after 2003. By that year roughly of that space was absorbed by new subtenants.

In 2008, Dell switched the power sources of the Round Rock headquarters to more environmentally friendly ones, with 60% of the total power coming from TXU Energy wind farms and 40% coming from the Austin Community Landfill gas-to-energy plant operated by Waste Management, Inc.

Dell facilities in the United States are located in Austin, Texas; Nashua, New Hampshire; Nashville, Tennessee; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Peoria, Illinois; Hillsboro, Oregon (Portland area); Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Eden Prairie, Minnesota (Dell Compellent); Bowling Green, Kentucky; Lincoln, Nebraska; and Miami, Florida. Facilities located abroad include Penang, Malaysia; Xiamen, China; Bracknell, UK; Manila, Philippines Chennai, India; Hyderabad, India; Noida, India; Hortolândia and Porto Alegre, Brazil; Bratislava, Slovakia; Łódź, Poland; Panama City, Panama; Dublin and Limerick, Ireland; Casablanca, Morocco and Montpellier, France.

The US and India are the only countries that have all Dell&#x27;s business functions and provide support globally: research and development, manufacturing, finance, analysis, and customer care. Dell was recognized as &quot;India&#x27;s Most Desired Brand in 2023&quot;, as per TRA&#x27;s Most Desired Brands report 2023.

===Manufacturing===
From its early beginnings, Dell operated as a pioneer in the &quot;configure to order&quot; approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications. In contrast, most PC manufacturers in those times delivered large orders to intermediaries on a quarterly basis.

To minimize the delay between purchase and delivery, Dell has a general policy of manufacturing its products close to its customers. This also allows for implementing a just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing approach, which minimizes inventory costs. Low inventory is another signature of the Dell business model—a critical consideration in an industry where components depreciate very rapidly.

Dell&#x27;s manufacturing process covers assembly, software installation, functional testing (including &quot;burn-in&quot;), and quality control. Throughout most of the company&#x27;s history, Dell manufactured desktop machines in-house and contracted out the manufacturing of base notebooks for configuration in-house. The company&#x27;s approach has changed, as cited in the 2006 Annual Report, which states, &quot;We are continuing to expand our use of original design manufacturing partnerships and manufacturing outsourcing relationships.&quot; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported in September 2008 that &quot;Dell has approached contract computer manufacturers with offers to sell&quot; their plants. By the late 2000s, Dell&#x27;s &quot;configure to order&quot; approach of manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications from its US facilities was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers as PCs became powerful low-cost commodities.

Assembly of desktop computers for the North American market formerly took place at Dell plants in Austin, Texas, (original location) and Lebanon, Tennessee, (opened in 1999), which were closed in 2008 and early 2009, respectively. The plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, opened in 2005 but ceased operations in November 2010. Most of the work that used to take place in Dell&#x27;s US plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell&#x27;s own factories overseas. The Miami, Florida, facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation, while Dell continues to produce its servers (its most profitable products) in Austin, Texas.

Dell assembled computers for the EMEA market at the Limerick facility in the Republic of Ireland, and once employed about 4,500 people in that country. Dell began manufacturing in Limerick in 1991 and went on to become Ireland&#x27;s largest exporter of goods and its second-largest company and foreign investor. On January 8, 2009, Dell announced that it would move all Dell manufacturing in Limerick to Dell&#x27;s new plant in the Polish city of Łódź by January 2010. European Union officials said they would investigate a €52.7million aid package the Polish government used to attract Dell away from Ireland. European Manufacturing Facility 1 (EMF1, opened in 1990) and EMF3 form part of the Raheen Industrial Estate near Limerick. EMF2 (previously a Wang facility, later occupied by Flextronics, situated in Castletroy) closed in 2002, and Dell Inc. has consolidated production into EMF3 (EMF1 now contains only offices). Subsidies from the Polish government did keep Dell for a long time. After ending assembly in the Limerick plant the Cherrywood Technology Campus in Dublin was the largest Dell office in the republic with over 1200 people in sales (mainly UK &amp; Ireland), support (enterprise support for EMEA) and research and development for cloud computing, but no more manufacturing except Dell&#x27;s Alienware subsidiary, which manufactures PCs in an Athlone, Ireland, plant. Whether this facility will remain in Ireland is not certain. Dell started production at EMF4 in Łódź, Poland, in late 2007.

Dell moved desktop, notebook and PowerEdge server manufacturing for the South American market from the Eldorado do Sul plant opened in 1999, to a new plant in Hortolândia, Brazil, in 2007.

==Security==

===Self-signed root certificate===
In November 2015, it emerged that several Dell computers had shipped with an identical pre-installed root certificate known as &quot;eDellRoot&quot;. This raised such security risks as attackers impersonating HTTPS-protected websites such as Google and Bank of America and malware being signed with the certificate to bypass Microsoft software filtering. Dell apologized and offered a removal tool.

===Dell Foundation Services===
Also in November 2015, a researcher discovered that customers with diagnostic program Dell Foundation Services could be digitally tracked using the unique service tag number assigned to them by the program. This was possible even if a customer enabled private browsing and deleted their browser cookies. &quot;Ars Technica&quot; recommended that Dell customers uninstall the program until the issue was addressed.

==Commercial aspects==

===Organization===
The board consists of nine directors. Michael Dell, the founder of the company, serves as chairman of the board and chief executive officer. Other board members include Don Carty, Judy Lewent, Klaus Luft, Alex Mandl, and Sam Nunn. Shareholders elect the nine board members at meetings, and those board members who do not get a majority of votes must submit a resignation to the board, which will subsequently choose whether or not to accept the resignation. The board of directors usually sets up five committees having oversight over specific matters. These committees include the Audit Committee, which handles accounting issues, including auditing and reporting; the Compensation Committee, which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the Finance Committee, which handles financial matters such as proposed mergers and acquisitions; the Governance and Nominating Committee, which handles various corporate matters (including the nomination of the board); and the Antitrust Compliance Committee, which attempts to prevent company practices from violating antitrust laws. 

Day-to-day operations of the company are run by the Global Executive Management Committee, which sets strategic direction. Dell has regional senior vice-presidents for countries other than the United States.

===Marketing===
Dell advertisements have appeared in several types of media including television, the Internet, magazines, catalogs, and newspapers. Some of Dell Inc&#x27;s marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, free bonus products (such as Dell printers), and free shipping to encourage more sales and stave off competitors. In 2006, Dell cut its prices in an effort to maintain its 19.2% market share. This also cut profit margins by more than half, from 8.7 to 4.3 percent. To maintain its low prices, Dell continues to accept most purchases of its products via the Internet and through the telephone network, and to move its customer-care division to India and El Salvador.

A popular United States television and print ad campaign in the early 2000s featured the actor Ben Curtis playing the part of &quot;Steven&quot;, a lightly mischievous blond-haired youth who came to the assistance of bereft computer purchasers. Each television advertisement usually ended with Steven&#x27;s catch-phrase: &quot;Dude, you&#x27;re gettin&#x27; a Dell!&quot;

A subsequent advertising campaign featured interns at Dell headquarters (with Curtis&#x27; character appearing in a small cameo at the end of one of the first commercials in this particular campaign).

In 2007, Dell switched advertising agencies in the US from BBDO to Working Mother Media. In July 2007, Dell released new advertising created by Working Mother to support the Inspiron and XPS lines. The ads featured music from the Flaming Lips and Devo who re-formed especially to record the song in the ad &quot;Work it Out&quot;. Also in 2007, Dell began using the slogan &quot;Yours is here&quot; to say that it customizes computers to fit customers&#x27; requirements.

Beginning in 2011, Dell began hosting a conference in Austin, Texas, at the Austin Convention Center titled &quot;Dell World&quot;. The event featured new technology and services provided by Dell and Dell&#x27;s partners. In 2011, the event was held October 12–14. In 2012, the event was held December 11–13. In 2013, the event was held December 11–13. In 2014, the event was held November 4–6.

====Dell partner program====
In late 2007, Dell Inc. announced that it planned to expand its program to value-added resellers (VARs), giving it the official name of &quot;Dell Partner Direct&quot; and a new Website.

Dell India has started Online Ecommerce website with its Dell Partner www.compuindia.com GNG Electronics Pvt Ltd termed as Dell Express Ship Affiliate(DESA).
The main objective was to reduce the delivery time. Customers who visit Dell India official site are given the option to buy online which then will be redirected to Dell affiliate website compuindia.com.

====Global analytics====
Dell also operates a captive analytics division which supports pricing, web analytics, and supply chain operations. DGA operates as a single, centralized entity with a global view of Dell&#x27;s business activities. The firm supports over 500 internal customers worldwide and has created a quantified impact of over $500 million.

====Criticisms of marketing of laptop security====
In 2008, Dell received press coverage over its claim of having the world&#x27;s most secure laptops, specifically, its Latitude D630 and Latitude D830. At Lenovo&#x27;s request, the (US) National Advertising Division (NAD) evaluated the claim, and reported that Dell did not have enough evidence to support it.

===Retail===
Dell first opened their retail stores in India.

====United States====
In the early 1990s, Dell sold its products through Best Buy, Costco and Sam&#x27;s Club stores in the United States. Dell stopped this practice in 1994, citing low profit margins on the business, exclusively distributing through a direct-sales model for the next decade. In 2003, Dell briefly sold products in Sears stores in the US. In 2007, Dell started shipping its products to major retailers in the US once again, starting with Sam&#x27;s Club and Wal-Mart. Staples, the largest office-supply retailer in the US, and Best Buy, the largest electronics retailer in the US, became Dell retail partners later that same year.

=====Kiosks=====
Starting in 2002, Dell opened kiosk locations in the United States to allow customers to examine products before buying them directly from the company. Starting in 2005, Dell expanded kiosk locations to include shopping malls across Australia, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong. On January 30, 2008, Dell announced it would shut down all 140 kiosks in the US due to expansion into retail stores. By June 3, 2010, Dell had also shut down all of its mall kiosks in Australia.

====Retail stores====
, Dell products shipped to one of the largest office supply retailers in Canada, Staples Business Depot. In April 2008, Future Shop and Best Buy began carrying a subset of Dell products, such as certain desktops, laptops, printers, and monitors.

Since some shoppers in certain markets show reluctance to purchase technological products through the phone or the Internet, Dell has looked into opening retail operations in some countries in Central Europe and Russia. In April 2007, Dell opened a retail store in Budapest. In October of the same year, Dell opened a retail store in Moscow.

In the UK, HMV&#x27;s flagship Trocadero store has sold Dell XPS PCs since December 2007. From January 2008 the UK stores of DSGi have sold Dell products (in particular, through Currys and PC World stores). As of 2008, the large supermarket chain Tesco has sold Dell laptops and desktops in outlets throughout the UK.

In May 2008, Dell reached an agreement with the office supply chain, Officeworks (part of Coles Group), to stock a few modified models in the Inspiron desktop and notebook range. These models have slightly different model numbers, but almost replicate the ones available from the Dell Store. Dell continued its retail push in the Australian market with its partnership with Harris Technology (another part of Coles Group) in November of the same year. In addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with the discount electrical retailer, The Good Guys, known for &quot;Slashing Prices&quot;. Dell agreed to distribute a variety of makes of both desktops and notebooks, including Studio and XPS systems in late 2008. Dell and Dick Smith Electronics (owned by Woolworths Limited) reached an agreement to expand within Dick Smith&#x27;s 400 stores throughout Australia and New Zealand in May 2009 (1 year since Officeworks—owned by Coles Group—reached a deal). The retailer has agreed to distribute a variety of Inspiron and Studio notebooks, with minimal Studio desktops from the Dell range. , Dell continues to run and operate its various kiosks in 18 shopping centers throughout Australia. On March 31, 2010, Dell announced to Australian Kiosk employees that they were shutting down the Australian/New Zealand Dell kiosk program.

In Germany, Dell is selling selected smartphones and notebooks via Media Markt and Saturn, as well as some shopping websites.

===Competition===
Dell&#x27;s major competitors include Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard (HP), Hasee, Acer, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Gateway, Sony, Asus, MSI, Panasonic, Samsung and Apple. Dell and its subsidiary, Alienware, compete in the enthusiast market against AVADirect, Falcon Northwest, VoodooPC (a subsidiary of HP), and other manufacturers. In the second quarter of 2006, Dell had between 18% and 19% share of the worldwide personal computer market, compared to HP with roughly 15%.

, Dell lost its lead in the PC business to Hewlett-Packard. Both Gartner and IDC estimated that in the third quarter of 2006, HP shipped more units worldwide than Dell did. Dell&#x27;s 3.6% growth paled in comparison to HP&#x27;s 15% growth during the same period. The problem got worse in the fourth quarter, when Gartner estimated that Dell PC shipments declined 8.9% (versus HP&#x27;s 23.9% growth). As a result, at the end of 2006 Dell&#x27;s overall PC market share stood at 13.9% (versus HP&#x27;s 17.4%).

IDC reported that Dell lost more server market share than any of the top four competitors in that arena. IDC&#x27;s Q4 2006 estimates show Dell&#x27;s share of the server market at 8.1%, down from 9.5% in the previous year. This represents an 8.8% loss year-over-year, primarily to competitors EMC and IBM. As of 2021, Dell is the third-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo and HP.

===Partnership with EMC===
In 2001, Dell and EMC entered into a partnership whereby both companies jointly design products, and Dell provided support for certain EMC products including midrange storage systems, such as fibre channel and iSCSI storage area networks. The relationship also promotes and sells OEM versions of backup, recovery, replication and archiving software. On December 9, 2008, Dell and EMC announced the multi-year extension, through 2013, of the strategic partnership with EMC. In addition, Dell expanded its product lineup by adding the EMC Celerra NX4 storage system to the portfolio of Dell/EMC family of networked storage systems and partnered on a new line of data deduplication products as part of its TierDisk family of data storage devices.

On October 17, 2011, Dell discontinued reselling all EMC storage products, ending the partnership 2 years early. Later Dell would acquire and merge with EMC in the largest tech merger to date.

==Environmental record==
Dell committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from its global activities by 40% by 2015, with the 2008 fiscal year as the baseline year. It is listed in Greenpeace&#x27;s Guide to Greener Electronics that scores leading electronics manufacturers according to their policies on sustainability, climate and energy and how green their products are. In November 2011, Dell ranked 2nd out of 15 listed electronics makers (increasing its score to 5.1 from 4.9, which it gained in the previous ranking from October 2010).

Dell was the first company to publicly state a timeline for the elimination of toxic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs), which it planned to phase out by the end of 2009. It revised this commitment and now aims to remove toxics by the end of 2011 but only in its computing products.
In March 2010, Greenpeace activists protested at Dell offices in Bangalore, Amsterdam and Copenhagen calling for Dell&#x27;s founder and CEO Michael Dell to &quot;drop the toxics&quot; and claiming that Dell&#x27;s aspiration to be &#x27;the greenest technology company on the planet&#x27; was &quot;hypocritical&quot;. Dell has launched its first products completely free of PVC and BFRs with the G-Series monitors (G2210 and G2410) in 2009.

In its 2012 report on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated Dell the eighth-highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.

===Green initiatives===
Dell became the first company in the information technology industry to establish a product-recycling goal (in 2004) and completed the implementation of its global consumer recycling-program in 2006.
On February 6, 2007, the National Recycling Coalition awarded Dell its &quot;Recycling Works&quot; award for efforts to promote producer responsibility.
On July 19, 2007, Dell announced that it had exceeded targets in working to achieve a multi-year goal of recovering 275 million pounds of computer equipment by 2009. The company reported the recovery of 78 million pounds (nearly 40,000 tons) of IT equipment from customers in 2006, a 93-percent increase over 2005; and 12.4% of the equipment Dell sold seven years earlier.

On June 5, 2007, Dell set a goal of becoming the greenest technology company on Earth for the long term. The company launched a zero-carbon initiative that includes:
# reducing Dell&#x27;s carbon intensity by 15 percent by 2012
# requiring primary suppliers to report carbon emissions data during quarterly business reviews
# partnering with customers to build the &quot;greenest PC on the planet&quot;
# expanding the company&#x27;s carbon-offsetting program, &quot;Plant a Tree for Me&quot;

Dell reports its environmental performance in an annual Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report that follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) protocol. Dell&#x27;s 2008 CSR report ranked as &quot;Application Level B&quot; as &quot;checked by GRI&quot;.

The company aims to reduce its external environmental impact through an energy-efficient evolution of products, and also reduce its direct operational impact through energy-efficiency programs.

==Criticism==
In the 1990s, Dell switched from using primarily ATX motherboards and PSU to using boards and power supplies with mechanically identical but differently wired connectors. This meant customers wishing to upgrade their hardware would have to replace parts with scarce Dell-compatible parts instead of commonly available parts. While motherboard power connections reverted to the industry standard in 2003, Dell remains secretive about their motherboard pin-outs for peripherals (such as MMC readers and power on/off switches and LEDs).

In 2005, complaints about Dell more than doubled to 1,533, after earnings grew 52% that year.

In 2006, Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer service. Issues included call transfers
of more than 45% of calls and long wait times. Dell&#x27;s blog detailed the response: &quot;We&#x27;re spending more than a $100 million—and a lot of blood, sweat, and tears of talented people—to fix this.&quot; Later in the year, the company increased its spending on customer service to $150 million. Since 2018, Dell has seen significant increase in consumer satisfaction. Moreover, their customer service has been praised for its prompt and accurate answers to most questions, especially those directed to their social media support.

On August 17, 2007, Dell Inc. announced that after an internal investigation into its accounting practices it would restate and reduce earnings from 2003 through to the first quarter of 2007 by a total amount of between $50 million and $150 million, or 2 cents to 7 cents per share. The investigation, begun in November 2006, resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted. It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer AMD. In 2010 Dell finally paid $100 million () to settle the SEC&#x27;s charges of fraud. Michael Dell and other executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions, without admitting or denying the charges.

In July 2009, Dell apologized after drawing the ire of the Taiwanese Consumer Protection Commission for twice refusing to honor a flood of orders against unusually low prices offered on its Taiwanese website. In the first instance, Dell offered a 19&quot; LCD panel for $15. In the second instance, Dell offered its Latitude E4300 notebook at NT$18,558 (US$580), 70% lower than the usual price of NT$60,900 (US$1900). Concerning the E4300, rather than honor the discount taking a significant loss, the firm withdrew orders and offered a voucher of up to NT$20,000 (US$625) a customer in compensation. The consumer rights authorities in Taiwan fined Dell NT$1 million (US$31250) for customer rights infringements. Many consumers sued the firm for unfair compensation. A court in southern Taiwan ordered the firm to deliver 18 laptops and 76 flat-panel monitors to 31 consumers for NT$490,000 (US$15,120), less than a third of the normal price. The court said the event could hardly be regarded as mistakes, as the prestigious firm said the company mispriced its products twice on its Taiwanese website within 3 weeks.

After Michael Dell made a $24.4 billion buyout bid in August 2013 (), activist shareholder Carl Icahn sued the company and its board in an attempt to derail the bid and promote his own forthcoming offer.

In 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute accused at least 82 major brands, including Dell, of being connected to forced Uyghur labor in Xinjiang.

<doc id="102493" wikidata="Q856562" url="?curid=102493" title="Sonic the Hedgehog 3">
<text>is a 1994 platform game developed by Sega Technical Institute and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis. Like previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games, players traverse side-scrolling levels while collecting rings and defeating enemies. They control Sonic and Tails, who attempt to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds to stop Doctor Robotnik from relaunching his space station, the Death Egg, after it crash-lands on a mysterious floating island. &quot;Sonic 3&quot; introduces Knuckles the Echidna, the island guardian, who lays traps for Sonic and Tails.

Development began in January 1993 by Sega Technical Institute in California, shortly after the release of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;. It was initially developed as an isometric game similar to what would eventually become &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; (1996), but became a conventional 2D platform game due to time constraints. &quot;Sonic 3&quot; was developed simultaneously with &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;; they were planned as a single game until time constraints and cartridge costs forced the developers to split it. The &quot;Sonic 3&quot; cartridge can be attached to an adapter on the &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; cartridge, creating a combined game, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 &amp; Knuckles. Michael Jackson composed portions of the soundtrack, but left the project and went uncredited; sources vary on how much of his work was retained, and many tracks were replaced in rereleases.

&quot;Sonic 3&quot; was released in North America and Europe in February 1994, and in Japan in May. As with its predecessors, it was a critical and commercial success, with critics seeing it as an improvement over previous installments. &quot;Sonic 3&quot; and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; sold a combined four million copies worldwide, placing them among the bestselling Genesis games. They have been rereleased in various Sega and &quot;Sonic&quot; compilations.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; is a 2D side-scrolling platformer. As with &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;, players can control Sonic, Tails, or both simultaneously. In the former choice, players control Sonic while Tails runs along beside him; a second player can join at any time and control Tails separately. &quot;Sonic 3&quot; adds the ability for Tails to fly for a short time by spinning his twin tails like a helicopter rotor. Unlike Sonic, Tails can also swim underwater.

&quot;Sonic 3&quot; takes place over six zones, each divided into two acts. Levels are populated with &quot;badniks&quot;, robots created by the villain, Dr. Robotnik; Sonic and Tails can defeat them by jumping on them or using the &quot;spin dash&quot; attack, which also gives the character a speed boost. The levels include obstacles and other features such as vertical loops, corkscrews, breakable walls, spikes, water that the player can drown in, and bottomless pits. There is a miniboss fight with one of Robotnik&#x27;s large, powerful robots at the end of the first act of each level and a boss fight with Robotnik at the end of the second. Reaching a new level saves the game to one of six save slots.

As with previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games, &quot;Sonic 3&quot; uses rings, scattered throughout the levels, as a health system; when the player is attacked without rings, is crushed, falls off-screen, drowns, or exceeds the act&#x27;s ten-minute limit, they lose a life and return to the most recently passed checkpoint. Dying with zero lives gives the player a game over. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an extra life, temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings, a shield that allows them to breathe underwater, a shield that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby rings.

&quot;Sonic 3&quot; contains two types of bonus stages. When the player collects at least 50 rings and passes a checkpoint, they can warp to the first type, which involves bouncing up a gumball machine-like corridor to earn power-ups by hitting a switch. Both sides of the corridor are lined with flippers, which disappear when the character bounces on them, and the switch drops when both flippers supporting it are removed. The corridor&#x27;s floor contains a bounce pad, which also disappears after one use; falling afterwards causes the player to leave the stage with the most recent power-up collected.

The second type, triggered by entering giant rings found in secret passages, involves running around a 3D map and passing through all of a number of blue spheres arranged in patterns. Passing through a blue sphere turns it red, and touching a red sphere causes the player to leave the stage, unless the player has just completed a cycle around an arrangement of blue spheres, in which case all of these spheres turn to harmless rings. Removing all of the blue spheres gives the player a Chaos Emerald; if Sonic (not Tails) collects all seven, he unlocks the ability to become Super Sonic, which makes him invincible to most obstacles. Failing to collect the seven Chaos Emeralds triggers a post-credits scene in which Robotnik and Knuckles taunt the player.

&quot;Sonic 3&quot; includes a competitive mode: two players, controlling Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles, race through one or all of five stages that do not appear in the main game. In these same stages, a single player can compete against the clock in time attacks.

===&quot;Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot;===

&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; were planned as a single game, but were released separately due to time constraints caused by a McDonald&#x27;s promotion and cartridge size limitations. The &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; cartridge features a &quot;lock-on&quot; adapter that allows other Genesis cartridges to be attached. Connecting the &quot;Sonic 3&quot; cartridge creates a combined game, &quot;Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot;. The lock-on function is available in most re-releases.

&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot; allows the player to play &quot;Sonic 3&quot; levels as Knuckles or &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; levels as Tails, or both Sonic and Tails. Other new features are the ability to collect Super Emeralds, unlocking new &quot;Hyper&quot; forms for Sonic and Knuckles and a &quot;Super&quot; form for Tails; improved save options; access to areas that Sonic or Tails could not previously access; altered boss forms; and an additional ending that shows Sonic returning the Master Emerald to Angel Island.

==Plot==
After Sonic and Tails defeat Dr. Robotnik in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;, Robotnik&#x27;s space station, the Death Egg, crash-lands on the floating Angel Island. The impact from the Death Egg&#x27;s crash causes the island to fall into the ocean. There, Robotnik meets Knuckles the Echidna, the last member of an ancient echidna civilization that once inhabited the island. Knuckles is the guardian of the Master Emerald, which grants the island its levitation power and has an equal power level of the 7 Chaos Emeralds. Robotnik dupes Knuckles into believing Sonic is trying to steal the Master Emerald, and that the launch base is Sonic&#x27;s base, turning the two against each other while he repairs the Death Egg.

Sonic and Tails approach Angel Island in their biplane, the Tornado. Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to transform into Super Sonic, but Knuckles ambushes him and steals the emeralds. Sonic and Tails travel the island hindered by Knuckles and Robotnik. At the Launch Base, where the Death Egg is under repair, Sonic and Tails fight Knuckles, but the Death Egg relaunches. On a platform attached to the Death Egg, they defeat Robotnik, causing the Death Egg to crash-land on Angel Island again. The story resumes in &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;.

==Development==
Like &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; was developed in California by Sega Technical Institute (STI). After the completion of &quot;Sonic 2&quot;, the producer, Yuji Naka, refused to develop another &quot;Sonic&quot; game if he had to work with the Americans again. STI split into two teams: one comprised Japanese developers, who worked on &quot;Sonic 3,&quot; and the other Americans, who worked on &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot;. Naka and Hirokazu Yasuhara were the primary creators of the &quot;Sonic 3&quot; design document and project schedule. Naka selected the majority of the team, while STI director Roger Hector oversaw development and Pamela Kelly led the marketing.

Development began in January 1993. The team initially used the Sega Virtua Processor chip, allowing for 3D graphics. They created a prototype with isometric graphics with the working title &quot;Sonic 3D&quot;. The original special stage featured a polygonal Sonic in a figure eight-shaped stage. When it became apparent that the chip would not be finished by 1994, &quot;Sonic 3&quot; was restarted as a more conventional 2D platform game. The designer Takashi Iizuka said the chip was an experiment to see if &quot;Sonic&quot; could work in 3D, and was abandoned due to its low polygon count. The isometric concept was eventually used for &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; in 1996.

According to Naka, the team wanted a deeper story to expand the &quot;Sonic&quot; world, which greatly expanded the project size. As &quot;Sonic&quot; was an action game with international appeal, they told the story visually, using in-game cutscenes, instead of text. The levels are triple the size of those in &quot;Sonic 2&quot;. Additional bosses, different musical arrangements and graphics were used to distinguish act 1 and 2 of each stage. Many elements were conceived during the development of &quot;Sonic 2&quot; but deferred to &quot;Sonic 3&quot;. 

&quot;Sonic 3&quot; and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; were originally planned as a single game. However, the manufacturing costs of a 34-megabit cartridge with NVRAM would have been prohibitively expensive. Due to the game&#x27;s scope and Sega of America&#x27;s commitment to launch a major McDonald&#x27;s Happy Meal promotion in February 1994, the team reluctantly split it in half, allowing more time to develop the second part and splitting the cost between two cartridges. The &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; cartridge&#x27;s lock-on technology was created, named and implemented so &quot;Sonic 3&quot; could be experienced as intended. Among other features, it allowed the developers to keep the paths designed for Knuckles in &quot;Sonic 3&quot;, which were inaccessible on the standalone cartridge.

&quot;Sonic 3&quot; features the debut of Sonic&#x27;s rival, Knuckles the Echidna. Many designs for the character were considered; for the final design, Takashi Yuda chose the kind of animal, and Pamela Kelly chose the name. Yuda envisioned him as a supporting character for Sonic, and felt he would make a good playable character. Whereas Sonic symbolizes speed, Knuckles symbolizes power, and the emphasis of the character was to break walls. His shoe coloration was inspired by Jamaica&#x27;s flag. The original name for the character was &quot;Dreds&quot;, referring to his dreadlocks. The design was tested with focus groups of American children. Knuckles&#x27; climbing ability allowed the developers to introduce more vertical gameplay.

Hector said &quot;Sonic 3&quot; had a troubled development. He recalled having to prevent the rest of Sega from bothering the team while simultaneously making sure the game would be finished in time. Additionally, Hector struggled to balance resources between &quot;Sonic 3&quot; and other projects, Naka was sometimes seen as a harsh leader, and American STI staff not on the &quot;Sonic 3&quot; team became jealous of the priority given to the game.

===Michael Jackson===
According to several sources involved in the development, Sega hired the pop musician Michael Jackson to compose music for &quot;Sonic 3&quot;, but he left the project and went uncredited. Fans speculated about similarities to Jackson&#x27;s music, but his involvement was not known until Hector mentioned it in an interview in 2005.

Jackson was a &quot;Sonic&quot; fan and had collaborated with Sega on the 1990 arcade game &quot;Moonwalker&quot;. Jackson&#x27;s tour director, Brad Buxer, assembled a team and worked on the project for four weeks at Record One in Los Angeles in 1993. They developed fully fledged tracks, with extensive samples of Jackson beatboxing, to be adapted for the Genesis. Hector said the work had a recognizable Jackson sound. Naka said that the development team visited Jackson&#x27;s home at Neverland Ranch during the development&quot;.&quot; Naoto Ohshima, the co-creator of Sonic, said Jackson recorded an a cappella demo tape for &quot;Sonic 3&quot;. 

During the development, allegations of child sexual abuse against Jackson emerged. Buxer said the team received no instruction to halt work and sent the finished soundtrack to Sega in mid-1993. According to Hector and Ohshima, Jackson&#x27;s involvement was terminated following the allegations. However, Buxer and two other members of Jackson&#x27;s team, Doug Grigsby III and Cirocco Jones, said Jackson went uncredited because he was unhappy with how the Genesis, which was incapable of playing back high-quality audio, replicated his music. 

Jackson&#x27;s music had already been implemented and had to be quickly reworked by Howard Drossin, who had joined the project expecting to work with Jackson. Other tracks were composed by Sega sound team members, such as Jun Senoue, who became a regular composer for the series. According to Buxer, Grigsby and Jones, their music remained in the game. Jones credited himself along with Jackson and Buxer for musical cues for &quot;levels 2 &amp; 3&quot; of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; on his website. An anonymous source involved in development also told &quot;GameTrailers&quot; that Jackson&#x27;s contributions, such as the Carnival Night Zone theme, remained. In 2013, it was discovered that the music for IceCap Zone was derived from a previously unreleased 1982 song, &quot;Hard Times&quot;, by Buxer&#x27;s band the Jetzons. The &quot;Sonic 3&quot; credits music became the basis for Jackson&#x27;s 1996 single &quot;Stranger in Moscow&quot;. 

Senior Sega staff, including Sega of America&#x27;s president Tom Kalinske, said that any involvement of Jackson was arranged without their knowledge, and that no formal agreements were made. In 2013, Hector said that any similarities to Jackson&#x27;s music in &quot;Sonic 3&quot; were unintentional. The journalist Ken Horowitz raised questions about Jackson&#x27;s alleged involvement, such as how an agreement between Sega and Jackson could have been kept secret from the media, why Sega&#x27;s marketing never mentioned Jackson&#x27;s involvement and why Jackson would reuse music originally composed for a video game. According to Buxer, Jackson only worked on one of the 41 tracks that his team composed. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; reasoned that, if this were true, it was unlikely that any music composed by Jackson himself remained in the game. 

Some &quot;Sonic 3&quot; tracks were replaced in the 1997 Windows port &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles Collection,&quot; as well as the remaster included in the 2022 compilation &quot;Sonic Origins&quot;. These tracks also appear in a &quot;Sonic 3&quot; prototype discovered in 2019, suggesting that they were written before being replaced by Jackson&#x27;s music. In 2019, &quot;GameRevolution&quot; noted that &quot;Sonic 3&quot; had been rereleased less frequently since Jackson&#x27;s death in 2009 and speculated that this was due to legal problems with his estate.

==Release==
&quot;Sonic 3&quot; was released in North America on February 2, 1994 (Groundhog Day), in Europe on February 24, and in Japan on May 27. Sega spent $20 million marketing it in the United States. To promote the European release, the British band Right Said Fred adapted their song &quot;Wonderman&quot; to include references to Sonic. The song was used in &quot;Sonic 3&quot; advertisements and released as a single, which charted in the UK at number 55. A single-cartridge version of &quot;Sonic 3&quot; and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Limited Edition&quot;, was canceled. A ROM image of this version was leaked online in 2008.

===Ports and rereleases===
&quot;Sonic 3&quot; is included in the compilations &quot;Sonic Jam&quot; (1997) for the Sega Saturn, &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles Collection&quot; (1997) and &quot;Sonic &amp; Garfield Pack&quot; (1999) for Windows, &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; (2002) for the GameCube, &quot;Sonic Mega Collection Plus&quot; (2004) for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Windows, &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; (2009) for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and &quot;Sonic Classic Collection&quot; (2010) for the Nintendo DS. The &quot;Sonic Jam&quot; version introduces &quot;remix&quot; options: &quot;Normal&quot; mode alters the layout of rings and hazards, and &quot;Easy&quot; mode removes certain acts.

&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; was released for the Wii Virtual Console in September 2007 and Xbox Live Arcade on June 10, 2009. The Xbox version was developed by Backbone Entertainment and has enhanced graphics for high-definition, online leaderboards, support for multiplayer via split screen and Xbox Live, and a new saving system that allows progress to be saved anywhere during play. A PC version was released via Steam in January 2011, as &quot;Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot; but later delisted as well as the other classic titles when &quot;Sonic Origins&quot; released.

&quot;Sonic 3&quot; was not included in the Sega Genesis Mini (2019), a dedicated console containing 40 Genesis games. AtGames, which was briefly involved with the console&#x27;s development, said the exclusion was due to licensing problems with the soundtrack. In 2014, independent developers Christian Whitehead and Simon Thomley proposed a remaster of &quot;Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot; for iOS and Android, developed using Whitehead&#x27;s Retro Engine, to Sega, similar to their remasters of previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games. Despite fan enthusiasm, Sega did not develop the project. Thomley speculated that this was due to legal problems regarding the music.

In 2022, &quot;Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot; was rereleased for the first time since 2011 as part of the compilation &quot;Sonic Origins&quot;. The &quot;Origins&quot; version is a new remaster running on the Retro Engine, developed by Simon Thomley of Headcannon, who previously worked on &quot;Sonic Mania&quot; and remastered versions of other Genesis &quot;Sonic&quot; games. &quot;Origins&quot; adds features including widescreen support and, in the expanded version, Amy Rose as a playable character. Since Sega was unable to use the original &quot;Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot; soundtrack, Senoue produced rearrangements of the MIDI music featured in &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles Collection&quot; using the original Genesis sound chip.

==Reception==

In the United States, &quot;Sonic 3&quot; was the top-selling Sega Genesis game in February 1994. It became one of the best-selling Genesis games, selling at least 1.02 million copies in the United States, with &quot;Sonic 3&quot; and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; selling a combined cartridges worldwide.

Like its predecessors, &quot;Sonic 3&quot; received critical acclaim. Critics generally felt &quot;Sonic 3&quot; was the best game in the series so far. Andrew Humphreys of &quot;Hyper&quot;, who declared himself not a &quot;Sonic&quot; fan, said it was &quot;undoubtedly&quot; the best of the series, including the acclaimed but obscure &quot;Sonic CD&quot;, though he said he preferred &quot;Sonic 2&quot; special stages by a small margin. &quot;Sega Magazine&quot;, however, stated that &quot;Sonic 3&quot; has better special stages and was not only superior to &quot;Sonic 2&quot; as a whole but would be &quot;a serious contender for the Best Platform Game Ever award&quot;. &quot;Sega Power&quot; wrote that despite their skepticism, they found it &quot;excellent&quot; and easily &quot;the most explorable and playable&quot; in the series. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; also compared &quot;Sonic 3&quot; favorably to &quot;Sonic 1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;CD&quot; and awarded it their &quot;Game of the Month&quot; award. They later ranked it number 1 in The EGM Hot 50, indicating that it received the highest average score of any game they had reviewed in the past year. Lionel Vilner of &quot;Génération 4&quot; believed &quot;Sonic 3&quot; offered more challenge than its predecessors. The Unknown Gamer of &quot;GamePro&quot; proclaimed that it &quot;proves that you can teach an old hedgehog new and exciting tricks. Take that old &quot;Sonic&quot; magic, add fun new variations, and you have another spectacular game.&quot;

Some critics felt that &quot;Sonic 3&quot; had innovated too little from previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games. Humphreys of &quot;Hyper&quot; saw only &quot;a few new features&quot; while &quot;Sega Power&quot; thought it was &quot;not all that different&quot; and Nintendo Life writer Damien McFerran said that &quot;there&#x27;s not a lot of new elements here to be brutally frank&quot;. While Deniz Ahmet of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; agreed that the game was &quot;more of the same&quot;, he was placated by the new and imaginative ideas. However, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; enjoyed the new power-ups. Many aspects of the level design were praised; &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; and &quot;Sega Power&quot; enjoyed the expansive stages, secret areas, much less linear level design, and difficulty. &quot;Mean Machines&quot; agreed, describing the game as &quot;a rollercoaster ride from start to finish&quot; and listing Carnival Night as their favorite level, which they described as &quot;probably the most slickly programmed portion of game in Megadrive history&quot;. Humphreys and &quot;Mean Machines&quot; felt that the game was too short, but they and &quot;Sega Magazine&quot; felt that its two-player mode and the Emerald collecting would significantly extend the replay value. &quot;Sega Magazine&quot; enjoyed having the ability to play as Knuckles in the two-player mode. The Unknown Gamer felt that while the two-player mode was less fun than the main game, it was much improved over &quot;Sonic 2&quot; due to the change of format from split-screen to full-screen.

The visuals were very well received. Humphreys described &quot;Sonic 3&quot; as &quot;one of the most beautiful games around&quot; and full of &quot;flashy new visual tricks&quot;, highlighting Sonic&#x27;s ascension up pipes and spiraling pathways as particularly inventive. &quot;Sega Magazine&quot; exclaimed that its graphics were &quot;brilliant&quot; even for a &quot;Sonic&quot; game, while Provo praised the &quot;elaborate&quot; backgrounds. &quot;Mean Machines&quot; thought similarly, giving special praise to the camera&#x27;s quick scrolling, the diversity of the level themes, and the &quot;chunkier, more detailed&quot; overall aesthetic. Rik Skews of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; stated that &quot;the graphics were stunning, attention to detail is breathtaking&quot;. Ahmet of the same publication also noted that the graphics were more detailed than those of previous installments. The Unknown Gamer described the settings as having &quot;gorgeous background detail and lots of visual treats&quot; and was impressed by the new obstacles that Sonic can traverse at top speeds.

The sound effects and music were also well received, though somewhat less so than the visuals. &quot;Sega Magazine&quot; described them as &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;far superior&quot; to &quot;Sonic 2&quot;. &quot;Mean Machines&quot; stated that every level had &quot;great tunes&quot; and sound effects and particularly praised the ending music. However, Humphreys described the sound as &quot;Sonicky ... with the emphasis on the &#x27;icky&#x27;&quot;; he also found it strikingly similar to the first two &quot;Sonic&quot; games&#x27; soundtracks. The Unknown Gamer also heard musical similarity to previous installments, and described the individual tracks as &quot;catchy... until you&#x27;ve heard it a hundred times.&quot;

Following the release of &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, the &quot;Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot; version of the game was critically acclaimed. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; rated this version of the game 97% and said, while &quot;you need to buy both &quot;Sonic 3&quot; and &quot;Sonic and Knuckles&quot; to fully enjoy&quot; it, &quot;Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot; &quot;is the best platform experience ever&quot; and &quot;what video games were invented for.&quot;

===Retrospective reviews===
At the review aggregator GameRankings, &quot;Sonic 3&quot; holds a score of 89%, based on five reviews published in the 2000s. The Xbox 360 version has a score of 79% at Metacritic. Lucas M. Thomas of &quot;IGN&quot; wrote that &quot;Sonic 3&quot; &quot;completed the trilogy as the best of them all&quot;. Dan Whitehead of &quot;Eurogamer,&quot; however, considered &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; superior.

Frank Provo of &quot;GameSpot&quot; wrote that the most significant addition was its save system. He also enjoyed the new power-ups. Whitehead said that the large stages would keep players sufficiently engrossed. Thomas and Provo enjoyed the use of wordless cutscenes to create a coherent story and thematically connect the zones. McFerran, however, felt that the visuals had been downgraded, particularly Sonic&#x27;s &quot;dumpier&quot; sprite and &quot;the infamous &#x27;dotty&#x27; textures&quot;. Thomas thought the music was &quot;impressive&quot;, but not quite on par with &quot;Sonic 2&quot;.

Some critics, such as Adam Ghiggino of &quot;PALGN&quot;, felt &quot;Sonic 3&quot; had been insufficiently upgraded for re-releases. Whitehead of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; wished online co-op had been implemented. Provo of &quot;GameSpot&quot; and Thomas of &quot;IGN&quot; wished that Sega had re-released &quot;Sonic 3&quot; and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; together as &quot;Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot; instead. &quot;Mega&quot; ranked it the fifth-best Genesis game in November 1994. In 2014, &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked &quot;Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot; as the seventh-best Genesis game. In 2013, Jeremy Parish of &quot;US Gamer&quot; ranked it eighth.

==Legacy==
&quot;Sonic 3&quot; was the first appearance of Knuckles the Echidna, who featured prominently in later &quot;Sonic&quot; games. &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot; (UK) and the Archie &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic (US) published adaptations of the game.

For &quot;Sonic&quot; 20th anniversary, Sega released &quot;Sonic Generations&quot;, a game that remade aspects of various past games from the franchise. The Nintendo 3DS version features a remake of the final boss, &quot;Big Arms&quot;, and re-arranged version of the &quot;Game Over&quot; theme. The Hydrocity level was also remixed in &quot;Sonic Mania&quot; (2017), and the Angel Island level had its first section recreated in &quot;Sonic Mania Plus&quot;&#x27; (2018) &quot;Encore Mode&quot;.

The feature film &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; draws inspiration from &quot;Sonic 3&quot;, though it is not a direct adaptation.

<text>Expressionism is a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting, originating in Northern Europe around the beginning of the 20th century. Its typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas. Expressionist artists have sought to express the meaning of emotional experience rather than physical reality.

Expressionism developed as an avant-garde style before the First World War. It remained popular during the Weimar Republic, particularly in Berlin. The style extended to a wide range of the arts, including expressionist architecture, painting, literature, theatre, dance, film and music. Paris became a gathering place for a group of Expressionist artists, many of Jewish origin, dubbed the School of Paris. After World War II, figurative expressionism influenced artists and styles around the world.

The term is sometimes suggestive of angst. In a historical sense, much older painters such as Matthias Grünewald and El Greco are sometimes termed expressionist, though the term is applied mainly to 20th-century works. The Expressionist emphasis on individual and subjective perspective has been characterized as a reaction to positivism and other artistic styles such as Naturalism and Impressionism.
==Etymology and history==

While the word expressionist was used in the modern sense as early as 1850, its origin is sometimes traced to paintings exhibited in 1901 in Paris by obscure artist Julien-Auguste Hervé, which he called &quot;Expressionismes&quot;. An alternative view is that the term was coined by the Czech art historian Antonin Matějček in 1910 as the opposite of Impressionism: &quot;An Expressionist wishes, above all, to express himself... (an Expressionist rejects) immediate perception and builds on more complex psychic structures... Impressions and mental images that pass through ... people&#x27;s soul as through a filter which rids them of all substantial accretions to produce their clear essence [...and] are assimilated and condensed into more general forms, into types, which he transcribes through simple short-hand formulae and symbols.&quot;

Important precursors of Expressionism were the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), especially his philosophical novel &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; (1883–1892); the later plays of the Swedish dramatist August Strindberg (1849–1912), including the trilogy &quot;To Damascus&quot; (1898–1901), &quot;A Dream Play&quot; (1902), &quot;The Ghost Sonata&quot; (1907); Frank Wedekind (1864–1918), especially the &quot;Lulu&quot; plays &quot;Erdgeist&quot; (&quot;Earth Spirit&quot;) (1895) and &quot;Die Büchse der Pandora&quot; (&quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;) (1904); the American poet Walt Whitman&#x27;s (1819–1892) &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; (1855–1891); the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821–1881); Norwegian painter Edvard Munch (1863–1944); Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890); Belgian painter James Ensor (1860–1949); and pioneering Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud (1856–1939).

In 1905, a group of four German artists, led by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, formed Die Brücke (the Bridge) in the city of Dresden. This was arguably the founding organization for the German Expressionist movement, though they did not use the word itself. A few years later, in 1911, a like-minded group of young artists formed Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) in Munich. The name came from Wassily Kandinsky&#x27;s &quot;Der Blaue Reiter&quot; painting of 1903. Among their members were Kandinsky, Franz Marc, Paul Klee, and August Macke. However, the term Expressionism did not firmly establish itself until 1913. Though mainly a German artistic movement initially and most predominant in painting, poetry and the theatre between 1910 and 1930, most precursors of the movement were not German. Furthermore, there have been expressionist writers of prose fiction, as well as non-German-speaking expressionist writers, and, while the movement declined in Germany with the rise of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s, there were subsequent expressionist works.

Expressionism is notoriously difficult to define, in part because it &quot;overlapped with other major &#x27;isms&#x27; of the modernist period: with Futurism, Vorticism, Cubism, Surrealism and Dadaism.&quot; Richard Murphy also comments, “the search for an all-inclusive definition is problematic to the extent that the most challenging expressionists such as Kafka, Gottfried Benn and Döblin were simultaneously the most vociferous &#x27;anti-expressionists.&#x27;&quot;

What can be said, however, is that it was a movement that developed in the early twentieth century, mainly in Germany, in reaction to the dehumanizing effect of industrialization and the growth of cities, and that &quot;one of the central means by which expressionism identifies itself as an avant-garde movement, and by which it marks its distance to traditions and the cultural institution as a whole is through its relationship to realism and the dominant conventions of representation.&quot; More explicitly, that the expressionists rejected the ideology of realism.

The term refers to an &quot;artistic style in which the artist seeks to depict not objective reality but rather the subjective emotions and responses that objects and events arouse within a person&quot;. It is arguable that all artists are expressive but there are many examples of art production in Europe from the 15th century onward which emphasize extreme emotion. Such art often occurs during times of social upheaval and war, such as the Protestant Reformation, German Peasants&#x27; War, and Eighty Years&#x27; War between the Spanish and the Netherlands, when extreme violence, much directed at civilians, was represented in propagandist popular prints. These were often unimpressive aesthetically but had the capacity to arouse extreme emotions in the viewer.

Expressionism has been likened to Baroque by critics such as art historian Michel Ragon and German philosopher Walter Benjamin. According to Alberto Arbasino, a difference between the two is that &quot;Expressionism doesn&#x27;t shun the violently unpleasant effect, while Baroque does. Expressionism throws some terrific &#x27;fuck yous&#x27;, Baroque doesn&#x27;t. Baroque is well-mannered.&quot;

==Groups of painters==

=== In Germany and Austria ===

The style originated principally in Germany and Austria. There were groups of expressionist painters, including Der Blaue Reiter and Die Brücke. Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider, named after a painting) was based in Munich and Die Brücke (The Bridge) was originally based in Dresden (some members moved to Berlin). Die Brücke was active for a longer period than Der Blaue Reiter, which was only together for a year (1912). The Expressionists were influenced by artists and sources including Edvard Munch, Vincent van Gogh and African art. They were also aware of the work being done by the Fauves in Paris, who influenced Expressionism&#x27;s tendency toward arbitrary colours and jarring compositions. In reaction and opposition to French Impressionism, which emphasized the rendering of the visual appearance of objects, Expressionist artists sought to portray emotions and subjective interpretations. It was not important to reproduce an aesthetically pleasing impression of the artistic subject matter, they felt, but rather to represent vivid emotional reactions by powerful colours and dynamic compositions. Kandinsky, the main artist of &quot;Der Blaue Reiter&quot;, believed that with simple colours and shapes the spectator could perceive the moods and feelings in the paintings, a theory that encouraged him towards increased abstraction.

=== The School of Paris ===

In Paris a group of artists dubbed the &quot;École de Paris&quot; (School of Paris) by André Warnod were also known for their expressionist art.&quot;&quot; This was especially prevalent amongst the foreign born Jewish painters of the School of Paris such as Chaim Soutine, Marc Chagall, Yitzhak Frenkel, Abraham Mintchine and others. These artists&#x27; expressionism was described as restless and emotional by Frenkel. These artists, centered in the Montparnasse district of Paris tended to portray human subjects and humanity, evoking emotion through facial expression. Others focused on the expression of mood rather than a formal structure. The art of Jewish expressionists was characterized as dramatic and tragic, perhaps in connection to Jewish suffering following persecution and pogroms.

=== In the United States ===
The ideas of German expressionism influenced the work of American artist Marsden Hartley, who met Kandinsky in Germany in 1913. In late 1939, at the beginning of World War II, New York City received many European artists. After the war, Expressionism influenced many young American artists. Norris Embry (1921–1981) studied with Oskar Kokoschka in 1947 and during the next 43 years produced a large body of work in the Expressionist tradition. Embry has been termed &quot;the first American German Expressionist&quot;. Other American artists of the late 20th and early 21st century have developed distinct styles that may be considered part of Expressionism. 

After World War II, figurative expressionism influenced artists and styles around the world. In the U.S., American Expressionism and American Figurative Expressionism, particularly Boston Expressionism, were an integral part of American modernism around the Second World War. Thomas B. Hess wrote that &quot;the ‘New figurative painting’ which some have been expecting as a reaction against Abstract Expressionism was implicit in it at the start, and is one of its most lineal continuities.&quot;
* Major figurative Boston Expressionists included: Karl Zerbe, Hyman Bloom, Jack Levine, David Aronson. The Boston Expressionists persisted after World War II despite their marginalization by the development of abstract expressionism centered in New York City, and are currently in the third generation.
* New York Figurative Expressionism of the 1950s represented New York figurative artists such as Robert Beauchamp, Elaine de Kooning, Robert Goodnough, Grace Hartigan, Lester Johnson, Alex Katz, George McNeil (artist), Jan Muller, Fairfield Porter, Gregorio Prestopino, Larry Rivers and Bob Thompson.
* Lyrical Abstraction, Tachisme of the 1940s and 1950s in Europe represented by artists such as Georges Mathieu, Hans Hartung, Nicolas de Staël and others.
* Bay Area Figurative Movement represented by early figurative expressionists from the San Francisco area Elmer Bischoff, Richard Diebenkorn, and David Park. The movement from 1950 to 1965 was joined by Theophilus Brown, Paul Wonner, Hassel Smith, Nathan Oliveira, Jay DeFeo, Joan Brown, Manuel Neri, Frank Lobdell, and Roland Peterson.
* Abstract expressionism of the 1950s represented American artists such as Louise Bourgeois, Hans Burkhardt, Mary Callery, Nicolas Carone, Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, Philip Guston, and others that participated with figurative expressionism.
* Sōsaku-hanga (創作版画 &quot;creative prints&quot;) was an expressionist woodblock print movement in early 20th century Japan. The movement was characterized by the work of Kanae Yamamoto (artist), Kōshirō Onchi, and many others.
* Lyrical Abstraction in the United States and Canada beginning during the late 1960s and the 1970s. Characterized by the work of Dan Christensen, Peter Young, Ronnie Landfield, Ronald Davis, Larry Poons, Walter Darby Bannard, Charles Arnoldi, Pat Lipsky and many others.
* Neo-expressionism was an international revival style that began in the late 1970s and 1980s.

==Representative paintings==
==In other arts==
The Expressionist movement included other types of culture, including dance, sculpture, cinema and theatre.
===Dance===

Exponents of expressionist dance included Mary Wigman, Rudolf von Laban, and Pina Bausch.

===Sculpture===
Some sculptors used the Expressionist style, as for example Ernst Barlach. Other expressionist artists known mainly as painters, such as Erich Heckel, also worked with sculpture.

===Cinema===

There was an Expressionist style in German cinema, important examples of which are Robert Wiene&#x27;s &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920), Paul Wegener&#x27;s &quot;The Golem: How He Came into the World&quot; (1920), Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927) and F. W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror&quot; (1922) and &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; (1924). The term &quot;expressionist&quot; is also sometimes used to refer to stylistic devices thought to resemble those of German Expressionism, such as film noir cinematography or the style of several of the films of Ingmar Bergman. More generally, the term expressionism can be used to describe cinematic styles of great artifice, such as the technicolor melodramas of Douglas Sirk or the sound and visual design of David Lynch&#x27;s films.

Two leading Expressionist journals published in Berlin were &quot;Der Sturm&quot;, published by Herwarth Walden starting in 1910, and &quot;Die Aktion&quot;, which first appeared in 1911 and was edited by Franz Pfemfert. &quot;Der Sturm&quot; published poetry and prose from contributors such as Peter Altenberg, Max Brod, Richard Dehmel, Alfred Döblin, Anatole France, Knut Hamsun, Arno Holz, Karl Kraus, Selma Lagerlöf, Adolf Loos, Heinrich Mann, Paul Scheerbart, and René Schickele, and writings, drawings, and prints by such artists as Kokoschka, Kandinsky, and members of &quot;Der blaue Reiter&quot;.

====Drama====

Oskar Kokoschka&#x27;s 1909 playlet, &quot;Murderer, The Hope of Women&quot; is often termed the first expressionist drama. In it, an unnamed man and woman struggle for dominance. The man brands the woman; she stabs and imprisons him. He frees himself and she falls dead at his touch. As the play ends, he slaughters all around him (in the words of the text) &quot;like mosquitoes.&quot; The extreme simplification of characters to mythic types, choral effects, declamatory dialogue and heightened intensity all would become characteristic of later expressionist plays. The German composer Paul Hindemith created an operatic version of this play, which premiered in 1921.

Expressionism was a dominant influence on early 20th-century German theatre, of which Georg Kaiser and Ernst Toller were the most famous playwrights. Other notable Expressionist dramatists included Reinhard Sorge, Walter Hasenclever, Hans Henny Jahnn, and Arnolt Bronnen. Important precursors were the Swedish playwright August Strindberg and German actor and dramatist Frank Wedekind. During the 1920s, Expressionism enjoyed a brief period of influence in American theatre, including the early modernist plays by Eugene O&#x27;Neill (&quot;The Hairy Ape&quot;, &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; and &quot;The Great God Brown&quot;), Sophie Treadwell (&quot;Machinal&quot;) and Elmer Rice (&quot;The Adding Machine&quot;).

Expressionist plays often dramatise the spiritual awakening and sufferings of their protagonists. Some utilise an episodic dramatic structure and are known as &quot;Stationendramen&quot; (station plays), modeled on the presentation of the suffering and death of Jesus in the Stations of the Cross. Strindberg had pioneered this form with his autobiographical trilogy &quot;To Damascus&quot;. These plays also often dramatise the struggle against bourgeois values and established authority, frequently personified by the Father. In Sorge&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&quot;, (&quot;Der Bettler&quot;), for example, the young hero&#x27;s mentally ill father raves about the prospect of mining the riches of Mars and is finally poisoned by his son. In Bronnen&#x27;s &quot;Parricide&quot; (&quot;Vatermord&quot;), the son stabs his tyrannical father to death, only to have to fend off the frenzied sexual overtures of his mother.

In Expressionist drama, the speech may be either expansive and rhapsodic, or clipped and telegraphic. Director Leopold Jessner became famous for his expressionistic productions, often set on stark, steeply raked flights of stairs (having borrowed the idea from the Symbolist director and designer, Edward Gordon Craig). Staging was especially important in Expressionist drama, with directors forgoing the illusion of reality to block actors in as close to two-dimensional movement. Directors also made heavy use of lighting effects to create stark contrast and as another method to heavily emphasize emotion and convey the play or a scene&#x27;s message.

===Music===

The term expressionism &quot;was probably first applied to music in 1918, especially to Schoenberg&quot;, because like the painter Kandinsky he avoided &quot;traditional forms of beauty&quot; to convey powerful feelings in his music. Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern and Alban Berg, the members of the Second Viennese School, are important Expressionists (Schoenberg was also an expressionist painter). Other composers that have been associated with expressionism are Krenek (the Second Symphony), Paul Hindemith (&quot;The Young Maiden&quot;), Igor Stravinsky (&quot;Japanese Songs&quot;), Alexander Scriabin (late piano sonatas) (Adorno 2009, 275). Another significant expressionist was Béla Bartók in early works, written in the second decade of the 20th century, such as &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1911), &quot;The Wooden Prince&quot; (1917), and &quot;The Miraculous Mandarin&quot; (1919). Important precursors of expressionism are Richard Wagner (1813–1883), Gustav Mahler (1860–1911), and Richard Strauss (1864–1949).

Theodor Adorno describes expressionism as concerned with the unconscious, and states that &quot;the depiction of fear lies at the centre&quot; of expressionist music, with dissonance predominating, so that the &quot;harmonious, affirmative element of art is banished&quot; (Adorno 2009, 275–76). &quot;Erwartung&quot; and &quot;Die Glückliche Hand&quot;, by Schoenberg, and &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, an opera by Alban Berg (based on the play &quot;Woyzeck&quot; by Georg Büchner), are examples of Expressionist works. If one were to draw an analogy from paintings, one may describe the expressionist painting technique as the distortion of reality (mostly colors and shapes) to create a nightmarish effect for the particular painting as a whole. Expressionist music roughly does the same thing, where the dramatically increased dissonance creates, aurally, a nightmarish atmosphere.

===Architecture===
In architecture, two specific buildings are identified as Expressionist: Bruno Taut&#x27;s Glass Pavilion of the Cologne Werkbund Exhibition (1914), and Erich Mendelsohn&#x27;s Einstein Tower in Potsdam, Germany completed in 1921. The interior of Hans Poelzig&#x27;s Berlin theatre (the Grosse Schauspielhaus), designed for the director Max Reinhardt, is also cited sometimes. The influential architectural critic and historian Sigfried Giedion, in his book &quot;Space, Time and Architecture&quot; (1941), dismissed Expressionist architecture as a part of the development of functionalism. In Mexico, in 1953, German émigré Mathias Goeritz published the &quot;Arquitectura Emocional&quot; (&quot;Emotional Architecture&quot;) manifesto with which he declared that &quot;architecture&#x27;s principal function is emotion&quot;. Modern Mexican architect Luis Barragán adopted the term that influenced his work. The two of them collaborated in the project Torres de Satélite (1957–58) guided by Goeritz&#x27;s principles of &quot;Arquitectura Emocional&quot;. It was only during the 1970s that Expressionism in architecture came to be re-evaluated more positively.

<text>John Speed (1551 or 1552 – 28 July 1629) was an English cartographer, chronologer and historian of Cheshire origins. The son of a citizen and Merchant Taylor in London, he rose from his family occupation to accept the task of drawing together and revising the histories, topographies and maps of the Kingdoms of Great Britain as an exposition of the union of their monarchies in the person of King James I and VI. He accomplished this with remarkable success, with the support and assistance of the leading antiquarian scholars of his generation. He drew upon and improved the shire maps of Christopher Saxton, John Norden and others, being the first to incorporate the hundred-boundaries into them, and he was the surveyor and originator of many of the town or city plans inset within them. His work helped to define early modern concepts of British national identity. His Biblical genealogies were also formally associated with the first edition of the King James Bible. He is among the most famous of English mapmakers.

== Family and early life ==
According to his daughter Sarah Blackmore, John Speed was born in the Cheshire village of Farndon in c. 1551/52. Various families of Speed dwelt in that neighbourhood, but John&#x27;s relation to them is not precisely established. His father John Speed gained the freedom of the Company of Merchant Taylors of London in April 1556, and is supposed to be the same John Speed who married Elizabeth Cheynye at Christchurch, Newgate Street in the City of London in January 1555/56. From this it is inferred that Speed&#x27;s birth-mother died during his infancy.
By his own account, Speed followed in his father&#x27;s mercantile business in London, and in 1580 he obtained the freedom of the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company by patrimony. He had married Susanna (born c. 1557/58), daughter of Thomas Draper of London, in 1571 or 1572, and began to raise a family. Most sources state that they had twelve sons and six daughters, of whom the most famous to reach maturity was John Speed, M.D., who studied at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, London and St John&#x27;s College, Oxford. It appears that the Speed family was fairly well-to-do.

== Patronage ==
Speed came to the attention of learned individuals, among whom was Sir Fulke Greville: Greville, &quot;perceiving how his wide soul was stuffed with too narrow an occupation&quot; (as Thomas Fuller has it), thereafter made him an allowance to enable him to devote his whole attention to research:

In around 1590 Speed was working with the Puritan scholar Hugh Broughton, and developing their work on the genealogies of Jesus Christ. By 1595 he published a map of biblical Canaan, and in 1598 he presented his maps to Queen Elizabeth. As a reward for these efforts, Elizabeth granted Speed the position of a Waiter (a customs officer):

He was by then a scholar with a highly developed pictorial faculty. In 1600 he presented three maps of his own making to the Merchant Taylors, who hung them in their Hall or Parlour and made provision for them to be protected by curtains. This gift was remembered in 1601 when Speed sought a lease from the company on a property in Fenchurch Street, a request which failed owing to a higher claim:

In 1598 he contributed a genealogical and heraldic frontispiece to Thomas Speght&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Works of Geffrey Chaucer&quot;, reprinted 1602.

=== Career ===

&quot;I shall not fear to commend in the first place, that famous Man John Speed&quot;, wrote Degory Wheare in 1637. &quot;He having travell&#x27;d over all Great Britain, read diligently all our own Historians, and those of our neighbour Nations, together with a diligent search in the Publick Offices, Rolls, Monuments, and Ancient Writings, or Charters, built up a Splendid and Admired &quot;Theatre of the British Empire&quot;; which, with great Expedition and Labour, he perfected in XIV. years...&quot; In 1611–1612 the first collated edition of Speed&#x27;s celebrated atlas and history of Great Britain was published, his son perhaps assisting Speed in preparing surveys of English towns. At the same time, with royal consent, his Sacred Genealogies became incorporated into the first editions of the King James Bible. 

In May 1612 Prince Henry asked the Merchant Taylors for his lease on the Company&#x27;s house in Fenchurch Street to be renewed for Sir Arthur Ingram, as reward for Ingram&#x27;s good service as Master of the Customs House - which was granted, &quot;to the prejudice&quot; of their brother John Speed. In the 1611 conclusion of his &quot;History&quot; Speed wrote of &quot;my disease growne dangerous, and life held in suspence.&quot; His friend Alexander Gill contributed one of the commendatory verses of the work to Speed, &quot;being very sicke&quot;, and wrote that his &quot;...cruell symptomes, and these thirteene yeers assay / For thy deare country, doth thy health &amp; strength decay.&quot; (This dates the commencement of the project to about 1598, as Degory Wheare thought.) But it was as a very renowned person that in 1614 Speed negotiated for the Merchant Taylors the renewal of their lease of the gardens and &quot;tayntor&quot; grounds (racks for the drying of dyed cloths) in the prebendary lands at Moorfields, London which the Company held from the Chapter of St. Paul&#x27;s. 

In 1615 Speed requested of the Company the renewal and extension of the lease on a garden and tenement, granted by them in 1594 to George Sotherton, which Speed had since held and upon which he had built &quot;a fayer house&quot;, but which he had afterwards surrendered to them with nine years of his tenure still outstanding. A new term of 31 years as from Christmas 1614 was approved. Speed then purchased an adjacent garden and plot of taynter to enlarge his own grounds, and in 1618 (after inspection by the Master and Wardens) obtained the Company&#x27;s permission to annex it and to enclose it with a wall, together with another new lease. As the lease of the premises was later renewed to his heirs, it appears that this house and grounds remained John Speed&#x27;s residence until his death.

During the same period Speed greatly enlarged his work on the sacred chronologies and genealogies, as &quot;A Clowde of Witnesses&quot; (1616, 2nd 1620): and after re-issue in various forms, his &quot;History&quot; and &quot;Theatre&quot; were newly presented as a Second, revised Edition, in 1623. In his last years, Speed was working on further revisions and adaptations of his atlas in other formats, and on the materials for his world atlas, which took shape as his &quot;Prospect of the Most Famous Parts of the World&quot; in 1627. He continued to maintain his annals, though by April 1626 he had become blind and suffered from the stone.

===Death===
John Speed died in July 1629 at the age of 77 or 78. He was buried alongside his wife (who had died in the previous year) in London&#x27;s St Giles-without-Cripplegate church on Fore Street. According to Fuller, his funeral sermon was delivered by Josias Shute. A monument to John Speed was soon afterwards erected on the south side of the chancel of the church. (See Monument and epitaph below.)

==Works==
===Biblical genealogies===

The Puritan clergyman scholar Hugh Broughton developed his study of Old Testament chronology and concordance in his work &quot;A Concent of Scripture&quot; in editions of 1588/89 and 1590, with illustrations said to be engraved by Jodocus Hondius. John Speed, &quot;by acquaintance with Mr. Broughton, [had] grown very studious in the scriptures&quot; (wrote John Lightfoot), &quot;and by his directions grown very Skilfull in them&quot;. Owing to the censure of puritan doctrines, Broughton recruited John Speed to see the work through the press, and from this collaboration arose the abstract of sacred genealogies first issued in Speed&#x27;s name in 1592. In around 1595 the two men brought out an index to that work. To that period belongs Speed&#x27;s first &quot;Map of Canaan&quot; (after Montanus) in four sheets.
In October 1610 Speed was granted a royal patent by King James to publish his genealogical work. In 1611, as &quot;The Genealogies recorded in the Sacred Scriptures according to euery family and tribe with the line of Our Sauior Jesus Christ obserued from Adam to the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot;, it was incorporated into the first edition of the King James Bible. For many years, this work (which had its own title-page) was bound into all copies of the Authorised Version, and it was reprinted for that purpose many times during the 17th century. It contained some now-famous illustrations, including an image of Adam and Eve taking fruit from the forbidden tree in the Garden of Eden, and a tree of the nations of the world arising out of Noah&#x27;s Ark. The royal patent enabled Speed to have the profit of it in reward for his various great labours. Speed is said to have admitted, for this reason, that &quot;Mr Broughton was a means under God of great Blessings to him, and his Children, for worldly comforts&quot;: he also reputedly confessed to having burned a great quantity of Broughton&#x27;s manuscripts.

This work was not merely an ornamental adjunct to the Bible, but had the serious intellectual purpose of expounding a resolution (or at least an explanation) of the differing descents of Jesus Christ from King David as they are recited in the Gospels of St Matthew and St Luke. His continuation and finishing of the &quot;Map of Canaan&quot; originated by a Puritan scholar, the Norwich minister and chronologer John More (who died in 1592), appeared with the date 1611 in the &quot;King James Version&quot;. But the version of this map which includes portraits of More and Speed was engraved after the Great Fire of London (1666), in which the original plates were destroyed (according to a text within the later map).

In 1616 Speed developed the genealogies into a longer work, &quot;A Cloud of Witnesses confirming the Humanity of Christ Ihesus&quot;, with lengthy textual explanations, in twelve chapters, for the descents shown in his diagrams or family trees. The first issue was printed by John Beale for Daniel Speed: (Daniel was presumably the stationer who had licence to marry Matilda Garrett in February 1617/18). Beale printed a second edition in 1620, with a dedication to George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury 1611-1633, and a third appeared in 1628 printed by Felix Kyngston for Edward Blackmore, Speed&#x27;s son-in-law. Speed&#x27;s distinctive style of genealogical diagram, with the names contained in circular bubbles linked in chains, later appeared in the royal genealogies in the 1623 edition of the &quot;History&quot;.

===&quot;History&quot; and &quot;Theatre&quot;===
John Speed&#x27;s fame today rests, in popular estimation, upon his work as map-maker, but this should not be held separate from his important contributions as a historian, chronologer, and scriptural genealogist. Many of his publications reached their definitive form in 1611. The succession of King James VI of Scotland to the crown of England and Wales, and to that of Ireland, upon the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, brought the Tudor dynasty to a close and inaugurated the House of Stuart monarchy of Great Britain. Speed&#x27;s historical researches under the patronage of Fulke Greville were stimulated or assisted by William Camden (Clarenceux King of Arms), Sir Robert Cotton, Sir Henry Spelman, John Barkham, William Smith (Rouge Dragon Pursuivant) and others, who during the 1580s together formed the Elizabethan College of Antiquaries, predecessor of the London Society of Antiquaries. Their interests were rooted in early-medieval English antiquities. But (after the abolition of that college by James I in 1607) Speed&#x27;s work came together, &quot;Cum Privilegio&quot;, as an instrument of the unification of British kingship in the person of King James, much as the &quot;Authorized Version&quot; of the English Bible to which Speed contributed his sacred genealogies. This English Bible was promulgated in the same year of 1611.

The chronicler John Stow (died 1605, also a Merchant Taylor), Speed&#x27;s elder contemporary, from 1562 sought to disentangle the confused order of the English Chronicles, finding much fault in &quot;the ignorant handling of ancient affairs&quot; by Richard Grafton: Stow&#x27;s &quot;Summarie of Englyshe Chronicles&quot; (and its abridgement) of 1566/67, several times republished, his &quot;Chronicles of England from Brute unto this present yeare of Christ, 1580&quot;, and his &quot;The Annales of England&quot; (1592, 1601, 1605), which itself lists a very wide range of sources, were the immediate predecessors to Speed&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;, from the historical aspect, as Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot; in the 1607 edition (with county maps) was his chorographical precedent. Stow announced a (much larger) forthcoming history of Britain, &quot;A Historie of this Iland&quot;, in 1592, but it never reached publication. Editions of Florence of Worcester, the &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot;, and of William of Malmesbury, Henry of Huntingdon and others in Sir Henry Savile&#x27;s &quot;Rerum Anglicarum Scriptores post Bedam&quot; came into print in the same period. The standard available edition of Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; (a primary text for the early medieval history of England) was in volume III of the Hervagius (Johannes Herwagen) 1563 &quot;Opera Bedae Venerabilis&quot;.
Speed naturally drew extensively on the work of his predecessors, including Christopher Saxton and John Norden as cartographers, William Camden as chorographer (&quot;Britannia&quot; 1586), and upon Stow and other late chroniclers, in so vast an undertaking (for which Speed considered his own powers quite insufficient), while at the same time revising, improving, verifying and subjecting to scholarly scrutiny all that he could, and where possible obtaining new expert contributions. Some letters survive from Speed to Sir Robert Cotton, written in the years before publication, asking for assistance in gathering necessary materials. Speed acknowledged gratefully that Sir Robert&#x27;s cabinets were unlocked and his library set open, to supply the &quot;chiefest garnishments&quot; of this work, such as antique altars and trophies, and ancient coins, seals and medals: that the books and collections of John Barkham were similarly brought to his assistance; and that William Smith, Rouge Dragon, had particularly helped in matters of heraldry.

From the first page of the &quot;Histories&quot; a fresh approach is afoot. Speed dispenses with the full list of pseudo-historic rulers stemming from Brutus the supposed founder of Britain, drawn from Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; and repeated by Stow, and instead touches upon the Trojan theory in his discussion of the &quot;Name of Britain&quot;. Coming into the Saxon narrative, marginal references identify the sources of information from Gildas (&quot;De Excidio Britanniae&quot;), Bede, Widukind of Corvey and many others, presenting an erudite voice and a discursive historical method, while preserving the structure and chronology relating to the seven kingdoms, and illustrating coins and other materials in true antiquarian fashion. James Spedding, noting the limitations in Speed&#x27;s account of Henry VII, allowed that his &quot;Historie&quot; &quot;was enriched with some valuable records and digested with a more discriminating judgement than had been brought to the task before.&quot;

===&quot;History of Great Britaine&quot;===
In the first edition of his &quot;History of Great Britaine&quot; (1611), following the &quot;Proem&quot;, the historical text begins as page 155 of the whole work, to which the maps of that edition are counted as occupying the preceding page-numbers, and presented separately as &quot;The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britain&quot;. &quot;This collection makes a noble apparatus to his history&quot;, observed Richard Gough, who noted that these were the first maps in which all the counties are divided into hundreds, and that those which Speed derived from Saxton&#x27;s maps were mostly so corrected or amended as to supersede any attribution to Saxton. The County descriptions printed on the reverse of the maps were mainly adapted from those of William Camden. Speed&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; is from this point a twin Chorographical and Historical work. In the issue of 1614 and the second, revised and augmented edition (of 1623) the whole work is introduced as being in ten Chapters, of which the first four (the &quot;Chorographicall Part&quot;) are the maps, arranged as:
* (1) Describing the whole Kingdome in generall, with those Shires, Cities, and Shire-townes which are properly accounted for English
* (2) Containing the Counties of Wales (13)
* (3) Scotlands Kingdom in one Generall (1)
* (4) Containing the Kingdome of Ireland – a general plan, and maps of Munster, Leinster, Connaught and Ulster (5)
The work then proceeds to the &quot;Historicall Part&quot;, Books 5-10, arranged as follows:
* (5) The Site, Names, Ancient Inhabitants, Manners, Government, Governors, Costume and Appearance of Great Britain and the Ancient British.
* (6) The Monarchs of Great Britain under the Romans (54 sections).
* (7) The Saxon Kings and English Monarchs, from the downfall of Britain and the origins and arrival of the Saxons, through the Heptarchy, from Hengest (sect. 13) to Edmund Ironside (sect. 45).
* (8) The Danish rulers, with their origins and first assaults, and in detail from Cnut to Harold II (7 sections).
* (9) The Norman rulers and their origins, continued from William I to the end of Elizabeth I (24 sections).
* (10) &quot;James, our dread Soueraigne&quot;.

The many coins, seals and other antiquities illustrated in Speed&#x27;s text were cut by the Swiss wood-engraver Christoph Schweitzer. An important feature of the &quot;History&quot; is Speed&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue of the Religious Houses, Colledges, and Hospitals Sometimes in England and Wales&quot;, appended to the reign of Henry VIII, said to have been compiled by the elder William Burton. The list was published in Latin in 1622 as &quot;Catalogus ex Anglico Ioannis Speed, Latinus&quot;, as appendix to Nicholas Harpsfield&#x27;s &quot;Historia Anglicana Ecclesiastica&quot;.

===&quot;The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine&quot;===

Speed is now best-known as a map-maker, and above all for his atlas, &quot;The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine&quot; (1611, 1616, 1623), which attempted a complete set of individual county maps of England and Wales, as well as maps of Ireland and a general map of Scotland. A 21-year royal privilege (franchise) for the printing of Speed&#x27;s &quot;Theatre&quot; was granted to George Humble in April 1608. The collection developed cumulatively, together with his &quot;History&quot;, and was undertaken with the encouragement of William Camden. The entire work, including the &quot;History&quot;, was dedicated to King James I as the ruler in whom the distinct Kingdoms of the British Isles had been brought together under one rule in such a way as to form an &quot;Empire&quot;. 

In the Introduction to his &quot;well affected and favourable reader&quot;, Speed acknowledged that he had &quot;copied, adapted and compiled the work of others&quot; rather than making an entirely new survey. He took various existing maps as his models, crediting five to Christopher Saxton, five to John Horden, two to William Smith, one to Philip Symonson (Kent) and others to John Harrington (Rutland), William White, Thomas Durham, James Burrell, and Geradus Mercator. Much of the engraving was done in Amsterdam at the workshop of the Flemish engraver Jodocus Hondius, to whom Speed&#x27;s project was recommended by Camden, and with whom Speed collaborated from 1606 until Hondius&#x27;s sudden death in 1612. The maps were printed by William Hall and John Beale, and sold by John Sudbury and George Humble.
Speed is admired also for his detailed plans of principal British towns, several of which are the earliest-known depictions of those places and provide valuable topographical insights. Most, but not all, of the county maps have town plans inset; those showing a &quot;Scale of Passes&quot; (i.e., &quot;Paces&quot;, reckoned at five feet imperial) were surveyed by Speed himself. On the back of the maps a text in English appears, describing the areas shown: a rare 1616 edition of the British maps has the text in Latin, in a translation by Philemon Holland, thought to have been produced for the Continental market. His maps of English and Welsh counties were often bordered with costumed figures ranging from nobility to country folk. Speed drew historical maps as well as those depicting present times, showing (for instance) invasions of England and Ireland, or the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy, a subject previously attempted (probably by Laurence Nowell) for William Lambarde&#x27;s &quot;Archaionomia&quot; published in 1568.

The &quot;Gardner copies&quot; in the Cambridge University Library are a collection of proof impressions from the engraved copper plates, taken during the process of checking the detail before the publication of 1611. In describing his intentions Speed admitted the possibility of errors despite his best endeavours:

The maps, in two-folio spreads, represented: Fol. 1, The British Isles; 3, England (General); 5, The Saxon Heptarchy; 7, Kent; 9, Sussex; 11, Surrey; 13, Hampshire; 15, Isle of Wight; 17, Dorset; 19, Devon; 21 [73], Cornwall; 23, Somerset; 25, Wiltshire; 27, Berkshire; 29, Middlesex; 31, Essex; 33, Suffolk; 35, Norfolk; 37, Cambridgeshire; 39, Hertfordshire; 41, Bedfordshire; 43, Buckinghamshire; 45, Oxfordshire; 47, Gloucestershire; 49, Herefordshire; 51, Worcestershire; 53, Warwickshire; 55, Northamptonshire; 57, Huntingdon; 59, Rutland; 61, Leicestershire; 63, Lincolnshire; 65, Nottinghamshire; [67], Derbyshire; 69, Staffordshire; 71, Shropshire; 73 [21], Cheshire; 75, Lancashire; 77, Yorkshire; 79, West Riding; 81, North and East Ridings; 83, Durham-Bishopric; 85, Westmorland; 87, Cumberland; 89, Northumberland; [91], Isle of Man; 93, Islands (Holy Island, the Farne Islands, the Channel Islands). 99, Wales (General); 101, Pembrokeshire; 103, Carmarthenshire; 105, Glamorganshire; 109, Radnorshire; 111, Cardiganshire; 113, Montgomeryshire; 115, Merionethshire; 117, Denbighshire; 119, Flintshire; 121, Carnarvonshire; 123, Anglesey. 131, Scotland (General). 137, Ireland (General); 139, Munster; 141, Leinster; 143, Connaught; 145, Ulster. In 2016, the British Library reprinted this collection of maps of the British Isles with an introduction by Nigel Nicolson and commentaries by Alasdair Hawkyard.

===Town inserts (examples)===

===Views of Welsh towns (examples)===
Speed represented Wales as a separate province from England but not as an independent entity.
===&quot;A Prospect of the Most Famous Parts of the World&quot;===
In 1627, two years before his death, was published Speed&#x27;s &quot;A Prospect of the Most Famous Parts of the World&quot;, printed by John Dawson for George Humble. This was the first world atlas produced by an Englishman. The principal sheets included the continents of 3, Asia, 5, Affrica, 7, Europe, 9, America; with the following domains, 11, Greece; 13, The Romane Empire; 15, Germanie; 17, Bohemia; 19, France; 21, Belgia; 23, Spaine; 25, Italia; 27, Hungarie; 29, Denmarke; 31, Poland; 33, Persia; 35, Turkish Empire; 37, Kingdom of China; 39, Tartarie; 41, Sommer Islands (Bermudas). With it were also included the County and Kingdom maps from the &quot;Theatre&quot;, corresponding to the third edition of that work, together with a &quot;New and Accurat Map of the World&quot; in a double hemisphere projection. A facsimile edition was published in 1966.

At 40 shillings, its circulation was limited to wealthier sort of customers, and to libraries, where many copies are nowadays preserved.

==Family==
The pedigree for &quot;Speed of Southampton&quot;, as prepared by the antiquary Benjamin Wyatt Greenfield in 1896, has the marriage of John Speed and Susanna daughter of Thomas Draper, Esq., of London, at its head, and shows the descendants of their son John. Although stating that Speed was born in 1542, and giving other dates which conflict with variant sources, it presents the names of six children. They are shown as:

* John Speed (1595-1640), M.D. (1628), studied at Merchant Taylor&#x27;s School (1603-04), and was Scholar (1612), B.A. (1616), M.A. (1620) and Fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Oxford. He married Margaret, daughter of Bartholomew Warner, M.D., of St John&#x27;s College (Professor of Physic). John died testate in 1640 and is buried in the chapel of St John&#x27;s College. Their sons:
** John Speed was a student of St John&#x27;s College, Oxford in 1652, and was Mayor of Southampton in 1681 and 1694.
** Samuel Speed, D.D. of Christ Church, Oxford, died in 1674. 
* Samuel Speed, Merchant Taylor of London, who married Joan, daughter of Richard Joyner, alias Lloyd, of Abingdon, and had a son Samuel who died in 1633
* Nathan Speed
* Joan Speed, who married John Hayley, Esq., of London
* Sarah Speed, who married Edward Blackmore, Esq., of London
* Anne Speed, who married Benjamin Wesley, citizen and Merchant Taylor of London

His arms, granted by William Camden, are: &quot;Gules, on a chief or, two swifts volant proper&quot;. Crest: &quot;On a wreath or and gules a swift volant proper.&quot; His monument, in the escutcheon within the broken pediment above the niche, shows these arms impaling &quot;Azure a chevron Ermine between three estoiles Or.&quot;

From their funeral monument, it appears that John and Susanna Speed had 12 sons and 6 daughters in all. 

==Monument and epitaph==
===Wall monument===
Richard Newcourt described the monument to John Speede at St Giles without Cripplegate. &quot;...the famous Chronologer and Historiographer John Speed, lies buried here, and hath a Monument on the South-side of the Chancel, with this inscription on one side for him, and on the other for his Wife&quot;:

Although the monument was damaged by enemy action in 1940–1941, an engraving of 1791 by John Thomas Smith shows how the panels carrying the inscriptions were originally disposed as if forming the opened hinged doors of a cabinet. The church&#x27;s website notes that it was &quot;one of the few memorials that survived the bombing&quot; of this church during the London Blitz of 1940–1941: a modern plaque records that the monument was restored in 1971 by the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company, in which John Speed was a citizen and brother. 

===Monumental brass===
In 1944 Sir William Burrell and Constance, Lady Burrell included a monumental brass, stated to be for the cartographer John Speed, among their collection donated to the city of Glasgow. It is described as a tomb brass representing a full-length male figure, 62.7 cm tall, facing three-quarters to the right [i.e. his left side turned away], his hands joined in prayer. He has short hair with a trimmed beard and moustache, and wears a gown and cape over a buttoned tunic surmounted by a ruff. The expression &quot;tomb brass&quot; suggests that this figure may have belonged to a group set into the covering slab of a stone table tomb (as opposed to a floor matrix), an inference supported by the comparatively unworn condition of the engraving.

The latten is torn away at the toe, suggesting a forceful detachment, but the rivet-holes by which the brass was originally attached to its stone matrix are neatly preserved, suggesting careful removal. The position of the figure indicates that there was once a corresponding, facing plate representing a wife. The squared edge of the brass plate below the foot possibly rested against another brass plate bearing an inscription. The descriptions by Newcourt, Strype and Granger of Speed&#x27;s monument agree with the text (including the words &quot;On the other side of him&quot; to introduce the inscription for Susanna) given in Anthony Munday&#x27;s 1633 edition of Stow&#x27;s &quot;Survey of London&quot;, and all clearly refer to the wall monument and inscriptions depicted by Smith and now remaining in restored form. If, however, the attribution of this brass to a tomb monument for John Speed is correct, it may enlarge the view of the original appearance of Speed&#x27;s monument as it stood on the south side of the chancel of St Giles. The brass is on display in the Burrell Collection.

== Interpretations ==
=== John Speed and William Shakespeare ===
William Shakespeare had near connections with St Giles, Cripplegate parish, of which John Speed was a parishioner. In his account of the reign of King Henry V, John Speed mentions that the character of Sir John Oldcastle, a Lollard martyr in Henry V&#x27;s time, was falsely represented in the theatres as a stock buffoon and rogue. He wrote,

The author of &quot;The Three Conversions&quot; was the Jesuit Robert Persons, and the references to the Lollard martyr Oldcastle are in the third part of the work. Speed is saying that Persons the Catholic author had infamously falsified the historical character of Oldcastle the Lollard martyr by representing him as the cowardly rebel portrayed in the late Elizabethan stage plays. Thomas Fuller, in his &quot;Church-History of Britain&quot; (1655), evidently echoes Speed where he remarks:
While Shakespeare&#x27;s character of Sir John Falstaff is evidently based on the stage-Oldcastle model, under a different name, the inference drawn by some editors (since Nicholas Rowe) that Speed was referring specifically to Shakespeare, or (if he was), that he intended to associate Shakespeare directly with Robert Persons and his Catholic sympathies, has long been debated. Possibly, Speed was referring to the author of a different play in which the Oldcastle figure appeared by name. A summary of the argument was presented by Edmond Malone&#x27;s editors.

John Speed&#x27;s maps and associated commentaries are sometimes employed for the interpretation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. Speed&#x27;s historiography employs &quot;theatrical metaphors&quot; and makes use of medieval mythical content.

=== Appreciation ===
In later years, Robert Sheringham (who recited Speed&#x27;s text to his map of the Isle of Wight) referred to him as &quot;summus et eruditus Antiquarius&quot; (&quot;a foremost and erudite antiquary&quot;), and he was called &quot;our English Mercator&quot;; &quot;a person of extraordinary industry and attainments in the study of antiquities&quot; (by William Nicolson); an &quot;honest and impartial historian... who was furnished with the best materials from some of the most considerable persons in this kingdom&quot; (by Stephen Hyde Cassan), a &quot;faithful Chronologer&quot; (in a text of 1656), and &quot;our Cheshire historian...a scholar...a distinguished writer on history&quot; (by Charles Hulbert). Richard Newcourt called him a &quot;celebrated chronologer and historiographer&quot;; James Granger observed, &quot;his History of Great Britain was in its kind incomparably more complete than all the histories of his predecessors put together.&quot;

&quot;And thus&quot; (says Thomas Fuller), &quot;we take our leaves of Father Speed, truly answering his name, in both the acceptions thereof, for &quot;celerity&quot; and &quot;success&quot;.&quot;

== Persistence ==
His maps were used in high-income circles, and therefore Speed&#x27;s influence was long-lasting and far-reaching. In 1673 and 1676 long after his death, other maps were published under his name obviously being counterfeits abusing the brand to represent the British Isles, the Chesapeake Bay region, and specifically Virginia and Maryland, the East Indies, the Russian Empire (then ruled by Peter the Great), Jamaica, and Barbados, and other locations. With these printings and many others, Speed&#x27;s maps became the basis for world maps until at least the mid-eighteenth century: his British maps formed an important topographical resource long after their original publication.

<text>William Camden (2 May 1551 – 9 November 1623) was an English antiquarian, historian, topographer, and herald, best known as author of &quot;Britannia&quot;, the first chorographical survey of the islands of Great Britain and Ireland that relates landscape, geography, antiquarianism, and history, and the &quot;Annales&quot;, the first detailed historical account of the reign of Elizabeth I of England.

== Early years ==
William Camden was born in London. His father Sampson Camden was a member of The Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers. He attended Christ&#x27;s Hospital and St Paul&#x27;s School, and in 1566 entered Oxford (Magdalen College, Broadgates Hall, and finally Christ Church). At Christ Church, he became acquainted with Philip Sidney, who encouraged Camden&#x27;s antiquarian interests. He returned to London in 1571 without a degree. In 1575, he became Usher of Westminster School, a position that gave him the freedom to travel and pursue his antiquarian researches during school vacations.

==&quot;Britannia&quot;==

In 1577, with the encouragement of Abraham Ortelius, Camden began his great work &quot;Britannia&quot;, a topographical and historical survey of all of Great Britain and Ireland. His stated intention was to &quot;restore antiquity to Britaine, and Britain to his antiquity&quot;. The first edition, written in Latin, was published in 1586. It proved very popular, and ran through five further Latin editions, of 1587, 1590, 1594, 1600 and 1607, each greatly enlarged from its predecessor in both textual content and illustrations. The 1607 edition included for the first time a full set of English county maps, based on the surveys of Christopher Saxton and John Norden, and engraved by William Kip and William Hole (who also engraved the fine frontispiece). The first English-language edition, translated by Philemon Holland, appeared in 1610, again with some additional content supplied by Camden.

&quot;Britannia&quot; is a county-by-county description of Great Britain and Ireland. It is a work of chorography: a study that relates landscape, geography, antiquarianism, and history. Rather than write a history, Camden wanted to describe in detail the Great Britain of the present, and to show how the traces of the past could be discerned in the existing landscape. By this method, he produced the first coherent picture of Roman Britain.

He continued to collect materials and to revise and expand &quot;Britannia&quot; throughout his life. He drew on the published and unpublished work of John Leland and William Lambarde, among others, and received the assistance of a large network of correspondents with similar interests. He also travelled throughout Great Britain to view documents, sites, and artefacts for himself: he is known to have visited East Anglia in 1578, Yorkshire and Lancashire in 1582, Devon in 1589, Wales in 1590, Salisbury, Wells and Oxford in 1596, and Carlisle and Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in 1599. His fieldwork and firsthand research set new standards for the time. He even learned Welsh and Old English for the task: his tutor in Old English was Laurence Nowell.
In 1593 Camden became headmaster of Westminster School. He held the post for four years, but left when he was appointed Clarenceux King of Arms. By this time, largely because of the &quot;Britannia&quot;″s reputation, he was a well-known and revered figure, and the appointment was meant to free him from the labour of teaching and to facilitate his research. The College of Arms at that time was not only a centre of genealogical and heraldic study, but also a centre of antiquarian study. The appointment, however, roused the jealousy of Ralph Brooke, York Herald, who, in retaliation, published an attack on &quot;Britannia&quot;, charging Camden with inaccuracy and plagiarism. Camden successfully defended himself against the charges in subsequent editions of the work.

&quot;Britannia&quot; was recognised as an important work of Renaissance scholarship, not only in England, but across the European &quot;Republic of Letters&quot;. Camden considered having the 1586 &quot;Britannia&quot; printed in the Low Countries, and although that did not happen, the third edition of 1590, in addition to its London printing, was also published the same year in Frankfurt, and reprinted there in 1616. In 1612 parts were condemned by the Spanish Inquisition. An abridgement was published in Amsterdam in 1617 and reprinted in 1639; and versions of the text were also included in Joan Blaeu&#x27;s &quot;Theatrum Orbis Terrarum&quot; (published in Amsterdam in 1645) and in Jan Janssonius&#x27;s &quot;Novus Atlas&quot; (again published in Amsterdam, in 1646).

== &quot;Annales&quot; ==

In 1597, William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley suggested that Camden write a history of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s reign. The degree of Burghley&#x27;s subsequent influence on the work is unclear: Camden only specifically mentions John Fortescue of Salden, Elizabeth&#x27;s last Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Henry Cuffe, Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex&#x27;s secretary, as sources. Camden began his work in 1607. The first part (books 1–3) of the &quot;Annales rerum Anglicarum et Hibernicarum regnante Elizabetha, ad annum salutis M.D. LXXXIX&quot;, covering the reign up to 1588, appeared in 1615. The second part (book 4, covering 1589–1603) was completed in 1617, but was not published until 1625 (Leiden edition), and 1627 (London edition), following Camden&#x27;s death. The first translation into English of books 1–3 appeared in 1625, done by Abraham Darcie or Darcy (). Book 4 was translated into English by Thomas Browne, canon of Windsor, in 1629.

The &quot;Annales&quot; were not written in a continuous narrative, but in the style of earlier annals, giving the events of each year in a separate entry. Sometimes criticised as being too favourably disposed towards Elizabeth and James I, the &quot;Annales&quot; are one of the great works of English historiography and had a great impact on the later image of the Elizabethan age. Hugh Trevor-Roper said about them: &quot;It is thanks to Camden that we ascribe to Queen Elizabeth a consistent policy of &quot;via media&quot; rather than an inconsequent series of unresolved conflicts and paralysed indecisions.&quot;

Camden heavily revised and self-censored his work to favour his patron. This included pages being overwritten, or passages covered by having pieces of paper stuck on. This made censored passages on hundreds of pages unreadable. In 2023 enhanced imaging technology using transmitted light made the hidden passages readable, revealing major insights, and confirming that the &quot;Annales&quot; were deliberately rewritten to depict Elizabeth&#x27;s reign in a way favourable to her successor. Amongst new revelations, the Annals reported that Elizabeth, dying, had named James VI of Scotland as her successor. Analysis of the manuscript drafts shows the deathbed scene to be a fabricated addition to support James&#x27;s succession. Pope Pius V was reported to have excommunicated Elizabeth due to &quot;secret plots&quot;; this originally had been the more inflammatory &quot;spiritual warfare&quot;, and had been toned down. the new material was being studied, with the expectation that modern interpretations of Elizabeth and her reign would potentially change.

==&quot;Remaines Concerning Britain&quot;==
Camden&#x27;s &quot;Remaines of a Greater Worke, Concerning Britaine&quot; was a collection of themed historical essays, conceived as a more popular companion to &quot;Britannia&quot;. This was the only book Camden wrote in English, and, contrary to his own misleading description of it in the first edition (1605) as being merely the &quot;rude rubble and out-cast rubbish&quot; of a greater and more serious work (i.e. &quot;Britannia&quot;), manuscript evidence clearly indicates that he planned this book early on and as a quite separate project. &quot;Remaines&quot; subsequently ran into many editions. The standard modern edition, edited by R. D. Dunn, is based on the surviving manuscript material and the three editions published in Camden&#x27;s lifetime (1605, 1614, and 1623). Editions published after 1623 are unreliable and contain unauthentic material, especially the bowdlerized edition of 1636 by John Philipot. Thomas Moule&#x27;s edition of 1870, of which many copies survive, is based on Philipot&#x27;s 1674 edition.

Camden&#x27;s &quot;Remaines&quot; is often the earliest or sole usage cited for a word in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;; and further significant early usages (including new words and antedatings) have since been identified. &quot;Remaines&quot; also contains the first-ever alphabetical list of English proverbs, since heavily exploited by the editors of the principal modern dictionaries of proverbs (including those of Burton Stevenson (1949), M. P. Tilley (1950) and the third edition of the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English Proverbs&quot;, edited by F. P. Wilson (1970)). Scattered through the book are a number of additional proverbs not recorded elsewhere.

==&quot;Reges, reginae&quot;==
In 1600 Camden published, anonymously, &quot;Reges, reginae, nobiles et alii in ecclesia collegiata B. Petri Westmonasterii sepulti&quot;, a guidebook to the many tomb monuments and epitaphs of Westminster Abbey. Although slight, this was a highly innovative work, predating John Weever&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Funerall Monuments&quot; by over thirty years. It proved popular with the public, and two expanded editions appeared in 1603 and in 1606.

==Other writings==
Among Camden&#x27;s other works were the &quot;Institutio Graecae grammatices compendiaria in usum regiae scholae Westmonasteriensis&quot; (1595), a Greek grammar which remained a standard school textbook for over a century; &quot;Actio in Henricum Garnetum, Societatis Jesuiticae in Anglia superiorem&quot; (1607), a Latin translation of the trial of the Gunpowder Plotters, aimed at an international readership; an unpublished essay on printing; and a number of Latin poems.

==Final years==

In 1609 Camden moved to Chislehurst in Kent, now south-east London. Though often in ill health, he continued to work diligently. In 1622 he founded an endowed lectureship in history at Oxford – the first in the world – which continues to this day as the Camden Professor of Ancient History. That same year he was struck with paralysis. He died at Chislehurst on 9 November 1623, and was buried at Westminster Abbey, where his monument, incorporating a demi-figure of Camden holding a copy of the &quot;Britannia&quot;, can still be seen in the south transept (&quot;Poets&#x27; Corner&quot;).

Camden left his books to his former pupil and friend Sir Robert Cotton, the creator of the Cotton library. His circle of friends and acquaintances included Lord Burghley, Fulke Greville, Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, John Stow, John Dee, Jacques de Thou and Ben Jonson, who was Camden&#x27;s student at Westminster and who dedicated an early edition of &quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot; to him.

==Legacy==
Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot; remained a standard and highly regarded authority for many years after his death. A lightly revised edition of Holland&#x27;s 1610 translation was published in 1637. A new and greatly expanded translation, edited by Edmund Gibson, was published in 1695, and was reissued in revised editions in 1722, 1753 and 1772. Yet another new and further expanded translation by Richard Gough was published in 1789, followed by a second edition in 1806. In an address given in 1986, marking the original publication&#x27;s 400th anniversary, George Boon commented that the work &quot;still fundamentally colours the way in which we, as antiquaries, look at our country&quot;.

Hitherto hidden censored passages in the &quot;Annales&quot; which became readable in 2023 may significantly change modern interpretations of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s reign.

The lectureship in history at Oxford endowed by Camden survives as the Camden Professor of Ancient History. Since 1877 it has been attached to Brasenose College, and since 1910 has been limited to Roman history.

The Camden Society, named after Camden, was a text publication society founded in 1838 to publish early historical and literary materials. In 1897 it was absorbed into the Royal Historical Society, which continues to publish texts in what are now known as the Camden Series.

The Cambridge Camden Society, which also took its name from Camden, was a learned society founded in 1839 by undergraduates at Cambridge University to promote the study of Gothic architecture. In 1845 it moved to London, where it became known as the Ecclesiological Society, and was highly influential in the development of the 19th-century Gothic revival.

After Camden&#x27;s death, his former home at Chislehurst became known as Camden Place. In the 18th century, it was acquired by Sir Charles Pratt, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and later Lord Chancellor, who in 1765 was elevated to the peerage with the title Baron Camden, of Camden Place. In 1786 he was created Earl Camden, and in 1812 his son became Marquess Camden. The family owned and developed land to the north of London, and so, by this circuitous route, William Camden&#x27;s name survives in the names of Camden Town and the London Borough of Camden.

<doc id="102498" wikidata="Q931579" url="?curid=102498" title="Ornithine decarboxylase">
<text>The enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (, ODC) catalyzes the decarboxylation of ornithine (a product of the urea cycle) to form putrescine. This reaction is the committed step in polyamine synthesis. In humans, this protein has 461 amino acids and forms a homodimer.

In humans, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is expressed by the gene &quot;ODC1&quot;. The protein ODC is sometimes referred to as &quot;ODC1&quot; in research pertaining to humans and mice, but certain species such as &quot;Drosophila&quot; (&quot;dODC2&quot;), species of Solanaceae plant family (&quot;ODC2&quot;), and the lactic acid bacteria &quot;Paucilactobacillus wasatchensis&quot; (&quot;odc2&quot;) have been shown to have a second ODC gene.

== Reaction mechanism ==

Lysine 69 on ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) binds the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate to form a Schiff base. Ornithine displaces the lysine to form a Schiff base attached to orthonine, which decarboxylates to form a quinoid intermediate. This intermediate rearranges to form a Schiff base attached to putrescine, which is attacked by lysine to release putrescine product and reform PLP-bound ODC. This is the first step and the rate-limiting step in humans for the production of polyamines, compounds required for cell division.

Spermidine synthase can then catalyze the conversion of putrescine to spermidine by the attachment of an aminopropyl moiety. Spermidine is a precursor to other polyamines, such as spermine and its structural isomer thermospermine.

== Structure ==
The active form of ornithine decarboxylase is a homodimer. Each monomer contains a barrel domain, consisting of an alpha-beta barrel, and a sheet domain, composed of two beta-sheets. The domains are connected by loops. The monomers connect to each other via interactions between the barrel of one monomer and the sheet of the other. Binding between monomers is relatively weak, and ODC interconverts rapidly between monomeric and dimeric forms in the cell.

The pyridoxal phosphate cofactor binds lysine 69 at the C-terminus end of the barrel domain. The active site is at the interface of the two domains, in a cavity formed by loops from both monomers.

== Function ==

The ornithine decarboxylation reaction catalyzed by ornithine decarboxylase is the first and committed step in the synthesis of polyamines, particularly putrescine, spermidine and spermine. Polyamines are important for stabilizing DNA structure, the DNA double strand-break repair pathway and as antioxidants. Therefore, ornithine decarboxylase is an essential enzyme for cell growth, producing the polyamines necessary to stabilize newly synthesized DNA. Lack of ODC causes cell apoptosis in embryonic mice, induced by DNA damage.

== Proteasomal degradation==

ODC is the most well-characterized cellular protein subject to ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation. Although most proteins must first be tagged with multiple ubiquitin molecules before they are bound and degraded by the proteasome, ODC degradation is instead mediated by several recognition sites on the protein and its accessory factor antizyme. The ODC degradation process is regulated in a negative feedback loop by its reaction products.

Until a report by Sheaff et al. (2000), which demonstrated that the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21Cip1 is also degraded by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-independent manner, ODC was the only clear example of ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation.

== Clinical significance ==

ODC is a transcriptional target of the oncogene Myc and is upregulated in a wide variety of cancers. The polyamine products of the pathway initialized by ODC are associated with increased cell growth and reduced apoptosis. Ultraviolet light, asbestos and androgens released by the prostate gland are all known to induce increased ODC activity associated with cancer. Inhibitors of ODC such as eflornithine have been shown to effectively reduce cancers in animal models, and drugs targeting ODC are being tested for potential clinical use.
The mechanism by which ODC promotes carcinogenesis is complex and not entirely known. Along with their direct effect on DNA stability, polyamines also upregulate gap junction genes and downregulate tight junction genes. Gap junction genes are involved in communication between carcinogenic cells and tight junction genes act as tumor suppressors.

Mutations of the &quot;ODC1&quot; gene have been shown to cause Bachmann-Bupp syndrome (BABS), a rare neurometabolic disorder characterized by global developmental delay, alopecia, macrocephaly, dysmorphic features, and behavioral abnormalities. BABS is typically caused by an autosomal dominant &quot;de novo&quot; &quot;ODC1&quot; variant.

ODC gene expression is induced by a large number of biological stimuli including seizure activity in the brain. Inactivation of ODC by difluoromethylornithine (DMFO, eflornithine) is used to treat cancer and facial hair growth in postmenopausal females.

ODC is also an enzyme indispensable to parasites like &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;, &quot;Giardia&quot;, and &quot;Plasmodium&quot;, a fact exploited by the drug eflornithine.

== Immunological significance ==
In antigen-activated T cells, ODC enzymatic activity increases after activation, which corresponds with increase in polyamine synthesis in T cells after activation. As with ODC and cancer, MYC, also referred to as c-Myc for cellular Myc, is the master regulator of polyamine biosynthesis in T cells.

A 2020 study by Wu et al. using T-cell specific &quot;ODC&quot; cKO mice showed that T cells can function and proliferate normally &quot;in vivo&quot; and other polyamine synthesis pathways can compensate for lack of ODC. However, blocking polyamine synthesis via ODC with DMFO and polyamine uptake with AMXT 1501 depleted the polyamine pool and inhibited T-cell proliferation and suppressed T-cell inflammation.

Recent studies have shown the importance of ODC and polyamine synthesis in T helper cell fate commitment. A 2021 study by Puleston et al. showed that TH1 and TH2 cells express higher levels of ODC than regulatory T (Treg) cells and TH17 cells, which corresponded to higher levels of polyamine biosynthesis in TH1 and TH2. A 2021 study by Wagner et al. showed a promotion of a Treg program in &quot;Odc1&quot;-/- mice. They concluded that polyamine-related enzyme expression was enhanced in pathogenic TH17 and suppressed in Treg cells.

<text>Mentha pulegium, commonly (European) pennyroyal, or pennyrile, also called mosquito plant and pudding grass, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae, native to Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Crushed pennyroyal leaves emit a very strong fragrance similar to spearmint. Pennyroyal is a traditional folk remedy, emmenagogue, abortifacient, and culinary herb, but is toxic to the liver and has caused some deaths. European pennyroyal is related to an American species, &quot;Hedeoma pulegioides&quot;. Though they differ in genera, they share similar chemical properties.

==Description==

An annual to perennial plant with creeping or erect branched stems to about 40 cm in height. The stems are square in cross-section and can vary from hairless on some plants to densely hairy on others, with a green to sometimes red or purplish colour. The leaves, which grow in opposite pairs, are narrowly oval, 2–3 cm long x 1 cm wide, downy, sparsely toothed towards the tip, and taper into a short stalk. All parts of the plant are strongly scented when crushed but it does not have noticeable glands on its surface. The small (6 mm) flowers are densely packed in whorls at the nodes, widely separated, above pairs of leaf-like bracts. The calyx is a ribbed tube about 3 mm long, with five triangular teeth, the lower two being narrower and slightly longer than the upper three; it is hairy both on the inside and the outside. The corolla has four mauve lobes or &quot;petals&quot; and is hairy only on the outside. The flowers are bisexual and have four long stamens, two (or all four) of which project well beyond the corolla lobes. There is one long style which is forked to produce two stigmas, which also project from the flower. The fruits consist of a cluster of four brown, 1-seeded nutlets, each about 0.7 mm long.

The flowering period starts in June and continues into mid-summer, although in northern countries it flowers rather later, sometimes as late as September, when it can fail to set seed.

Its chromosome number is 2n = 20.

==Distribution==
The native range of pennyroyal is thought to be around the eastern Mediterranean, where it grows in damp meadows, around pools and in stream margins. It is, however, very widely established around the world, including North and South America, throughout Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. In many places it is considered a troublesome weed of agriculture. Towards the northern edge of its range, as in Britain, it is considered to be rare and declining, except where introduced.

==Habitat and ecology==

The habitat of pennyroyal is seasonally damp pasture, where standing water over the winter leaves bare ground in the summer, and where livestock preferentially graze other plants. An analogue of this habitat is found on roadsides, where trampling or disturbance of the ground produces similarly bare soil, particularly where there is waterlogging in winter. It is also found along watercourses, in wet woodland and in abandoned fields.

In California, where it is considered an invasive species, it occupies a similar niche, in seeps, streamsides, vernal pools and swales, marshes, and ditches. There is some speculation that it may displace native species in these areas.

Few animals eat pennyroyal. In Britain, the only insect known to feed on it is the bug &quot;Heterogaster artemisiae&quot; Schilling, which is a seed bug that normally feeds on wild thyme.

It is considered an axiophyte in many British counties, because low-intensity pasture is a rare habitat, although it has been spreading in recent decades. Its Ellenberg values in Britain are L = 8, F = 7, R = 5, N = 7, and S = 0.

==History==

===Ancient and modern use===

Documented use of pennyroyal dates back to ancient Greek, Roman, and Medieval cultures. Its name – although of uncertain etymology – is associated with Latin &quot;pulex&quot; (flea), alluding to the manner it was used to drive away fleas when smeared on the body. Pennyroyal was commonly incorporated as a cooking herb by the Greeks and Romans. A large number of the recipes in the Roman cookbook of Apicius called for the use of pennyroyal, often along with such herbs as lovage, oregano and coriander. Although it was commonly used for cooking also in the Middle Ages, it gradually fell out of use as a culinary herb and is seldom used as such today.

Records from Greek and Roman physicians and scholars contain information pertaining to pennyroyal&#x27;s medicinal properties, as well as recipes used to prepare it. Pliny the Elder, in his encyclopedia &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; (&quot;Natural History&quot;), described the plant as an emmenagogue, and that it also expelled a dead fetus. Galen only listed pennyroyal as an emmenagogue, as did Oribasius. Roman and Greek writers Quintus Serenus Sammonicus and Aspasia the Physician however both agreed that pennyroyal, when served in tepid water, was an effective abortive method. A medical text on gynecology attributed to Cleopatra (though it was actually written by a female Greek physician Metrodora) recommends the use of pennyroyal with wine to induce abortions.

In regard to its contraceptive properties, it was referred to in a joking manner in Aristophanes&#x27; play &quot;Peace&quot; (421 BCE). The god Hermes provides the male character Trygaios a female companion; when Trygaios asks if there would be a problem if she became pregnant, Hermes responds, &quot;Not if you add a dose of pennyroyal.&quot; In a similar manner, in Aristophanes&#x27; comedy &quot;Lysistrata&quot;, after a pregnant female character on stage is told to withhold her body sexually from her husband, a slender female character, in comparison to the pregnant woman, is described as &quot;a very lovely land Well croppy, and trimmed and spruced with pennyroyal.&quot;

Early settlers in colonial Virginia used dried pennyroyal to eradicate pests. Pennyroyal was such a popular herb that the Royal Society published an article on its use against rattlesnakes in the first volume of its Philosophical Transactions in 1665. 17th-century apothecary and physician Nicholas Culpeper mentions pennyroyal in his medical text &quot;The English Physitian&quot;, published in 1652. In addition to its abortive properties, Culpeper recommends its use for gastrointestinal ailments, such as constipation and hemorrhoids, as well as itching and blemishes to the skin, and even toothaches.

Pennyroyal is an essential ingredient in the North african dish, which is still eaten to this day, called .

Pennyroyal continued to be used up through the 20th and 21st centuries. Its oil is still commercially available today, though little is known about the appropriate dosages for humans. Scientists therefore likely consider it unsafe for use, as it is potentially toxic.

==Uses==

Pennyroyal is frequently used as an insecticide and pest repellent. As a pest repellent, it is used to keep fleas away from household animals as well as on humans to ward off gnats and mosquitos. Some flea collars for pets have pennyroyal oil or the herb can be crushed in the lining. Humans have also put crushed pennyroyal stems in their pockets or on their clothing to ward off unwanted insects. However, when using the pennyroyal plant as a pest repellent, the use of the concentrated pennyroyal oil should be avoided. Pennyroyal oil can be extremely toxic to both humans and animals, even in small quantities. With the use of pennyroyal around animals and humans comes the risk of it being absorbed through the skin and causing negative health effects. The less concentrated leaves of the plant should be used instead as an insect repellent.

Pennyroyal has historically also been used as a mint flavoring in herbal teas and foods. Pennyroyal tea has been used for cold relief, fevers, coughs, indigestion, liver and kidney problems and headaches. The fresh or dried leaves of pennyroyal have also been used when treating influenza, abdominal cramps, to induce sweating, as well as in the treatment of diseases such as smallpox and tuberculosis. To make the tea, the leaves of the plant are boiled in hot water. The lower concentrations of toxic chemicals in these teas are less harmful than pennyroyal oil. It is recommended that people only drink pennyroyal tea periodically, as it is taxing on the body and should not be drunk on a regular basis. Consumption of pennyroyal tea can be fatal to infants and children.

In Italy the fresh leaves of this plant, which in Rome and the surrounding area is called &quot;menta romana&quot;, are used in the capital&#x27;s cuisine to flavour lamb and tripe. In culinary use it should not be confused with lesser calamint (&quot;Clinopodium nepeta&quot;), which in Rome is used to prepare artichokes.

The pennyroyal plant has also been used as an emmenagogue and an abortifacient. Chemicals in the pennyroyal plant cause the uterine lining to contract, causing a woman&#x27;s uterine lining to shed. Women who struggle with regulating their menstrual cycle or suffer from a cystic ovary syndrome may choose to drink pennyroyal tea. Pennyroyal tea is subtle enough to induce menstrual flow with minimal risk of negative health effects. More concentrated versions of the plant, such as the oil, are much more toxic and will likely force a miscarriage if ingested by a pregnant woman. Since the U.S. Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act in October 1994, all manufactured forms of pennyroyal in the United States have carried a warning label against its use by pregnant women, but pennyroyal is not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Rennie&#x27;s 1833 supplement to the pharmacopeias admitted its use as an &quot;expectorant, diuretic, and emmenagogue&quot; in doses of 10 grains to 1 scruple (0.6–1.3g) of the powdered dried herb, but dismissed the use of the Pennyroyal Water (Aqua Pulegii) as &quot;popularly but erroneously supposed&quot; to be an abortifacient [no mention is made of toxicity].

At least one study has shown pennyroyal oil to have potent acaricidal activity against house dust mites.

==Toxicity==

Pennyroyal is toxic to humans and has differing effects dependent on the volume and concentration ingested. The most concentrated and toxic form of the pennyroyal plant is pennyroyal oil. The oil contains 80% to 92% of cyclohexanone pulegone. Pulegone, the molecule in highest concentration in the pennyroyal plant, causes a variety of ailments in those who ingest it and is what causes the plant to have its peppermint flavor.

Symptoms that may persist after ingesting a small dose (&lt;10 mL) of pennyroyal oil are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and dizziness. Larger volumes may result in multiorgan failure that could lead to death. There are no current toxicokinetics studies performed on humans for the effects of pulegone, but there are some studies performed on other mammals. When pulegone is ingested, it is broken down by the liver and reacts to form multiple toxic metabolites that can wreak havoc in the body. Some identified metabolites are menthofuran, piperitenone, piperitone, and menthone.

==Chemistry==

===Structure and reactivity===

The active chemical in pennyroyal is pulegone. Pulegone is a ketone and on the cellular level, ketones can act as enzyme inhibitors. The carbonyl center of the pulegone structure acts as a strong electrophile, causing active sites on enzymes to bind with pulegone instead of the target protein.

The exocyclic double bond found in pulegone is vital to the activation and binding mechanism of the molecule and causes it to be an effective hepatotoxin. When ingested, pulegone targets the liver and kidney, among other organs. Studies conducted on rats show that one of the main effects is the inhibition of contractile activity in the myometrium and death by kidney failure. The studies also found that long-term exposure to pennyroyal increased incidences of urinary bladder tumors.

===Mechanism of action===

The exact mechanism of action by which pennyroyal induces menses and abortions in humans is still unknown. Studies using animal models speculate the source of liver toxicity is due to one of the many constituents the plant contains: pulegone, a monoterpene. Pulegone is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP 1A2 and 2E1) and converted to several toxins. Both &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; studies have found the pulegone metabolite menthofuran to be an inhibitor of CYP2A6, accounting for a significant degree of pennyroyal&#x27;s hepatotoxicity.

The exact pathway pulegone undergoes to be converted to menthofuran is unknown, but one study strongly suggested it included allylic oxidation of a methyl group (from CYP450), intramolecular cyclization to form a hemiketal, and subsequent dehydration to form the furan. Additionally, pulegone and menthofuran may deplete glutathione levels, leaving hepatocytes vulnerable to free radical damage.

==Treatment==
There is no known antidote for pennyroyal toxicity. Case studies involving pennyroyal poisonings have reported the use of gastric lavages and administration of emetics or vomiting inducing agents, or absorbents like activated charcoal. As glutathione depletion has been shown to regulate liver toxification, administration of N-acetylcysteine in similar doses as given for acetaminophen toxicity have been given to patients.

A study testing pulegone toxicity found inhibitors of cytochrome P450, such as cobaltous chloride or piperonyl butoxide, blocked toxicity. Such testing has not been expanded to humans, however, as the pennyroyal mechanism of toxicity is still not entirely understood.

<text>The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a database for the three-dimensional structural data of large biological molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, which is overseen by the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB). These structural data are obtained and deposited by biologists and biochemists worldwide through the use of experimental methodologies such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and, increasingly, cryo-electron microscopy. All submitted data are reviewed by expert biocurators and, once approved, are made freely available on the Internet under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication. Global access to the data is provided by the websites of the wwPDB member organisations (PDBe, PDBj, RCSB PDB, and BMRB).

The PDB is a key in areas of structural biology, such as structural genomics. Most major scientific journals and some funding agencies now require scientists to submit their structure data to the PDB. Many other databases use protein structures deposited in the PDB. For example, SCOP and CATH classify protein structures, while PDBsum provides a graphic overview of PDB entries using information from other sources, such as Gene Ontology.

==History==
Two forces converged to initiate the PDB: a small but growing collection of sets of protein structure data determined by X-ray diffraction; and the newly available (1968) molecular graphics display, the &quot;Brookhaven RAster Display&quot; (BRAD), to visualize these protein structures in 3-D. In 1969, with the sponsorship of Walter Hamilton at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Edgar Meyer (Texas A&amp;M University) began to write software to store atomic coordinate files in a common format to make them available for geometric and graphical evaluation. By 1971, one of Meyer&#x27;s programs, SEARCH, enabled researchers to remotely access information from the database to study protein structures offline. SEARCH was instrumental in enabling networking, thus marking the functional beginning of the PDB. 

The Protein Data Bank was announced in October 1971 in Nature New Biology as a joint venture between Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, UK and Brookhaven National Laboratory, US.

Upon Hamilton&#x27;s death in 1973, Tom Koetzle took over direction of the PDB for the subsequent 20 years. In January 1994, Joel Sussman of Israel&#x27;s Weizmann Institute of Science was appointed head of the PDB. In October 1998,
the PDB was transferred to the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB); the transfer was completed in June 1999. The new director was Helen M. Berman of Rutgers University (one of the managing institutions of the RCSB, the other being the San Diego Supercomputer Center at UC San Diego). In 2003, with the formation of the wwPDB, the PDB became an international organization. The founding members are PDBe (Europe), RCSB (US), and PDBj (Japan). The BMRB joined in 2006. Each of the four members of wwPDB can act as deposition, data processing and distribution centers for PDB data. The data processing refers to the fact that wwPDB staff review and annotate each submitted entry. The data are then automatically checked for plausibility (the source code for this validation software has been made available to the public at no charge).

==Contents==
The PDB database is updated weekly (UTC+0 Wednesday), along with its holdings list. , the PDB comprised:

::162,041 structures in the PDB have a structure factor file.
::11,242 structures have an NMR restraint file.
::5,774 structures in the PDB have a chemical shifts file.
::13,388 structures in the PDB have a 3DEM map file deposited in EM Data Bank

Most structures are determined by X-ray diffraction, but about 7% of structures are determined by protein NMR. When using X-ray diffraction, approximations of the coordinates of the atoms of the protein are obtained, whereas using NMR, the distance between pairs of atoms of the protein is estimated. The final conformation of the protein is obtained from NMR by solving a distance geometry problem. After 2013, a growing number of proteins are determined by cryo-electron microscopy. 

For PDB structures determined by X-ray diffraction that have a structure factor file, their electron density map may be viewed. The data of such structures may be viewed on the three PDB websites. 

Historically, the number of structures in the PDB has grown at an approximately exponential rate, with 100 registered structures in 1982, 1,000 structures in 1993, 10,000 in 1999, 100,000 in 2014, and 200,000 in January 2023.

==File format==

The file format initially used by the PDB was called the PDB file format. The original format was restricted by the width of computer punch cards to 80 characters per line. Around 1996, the &quot;macromolecular Crystallographic Information file&quot; format, mmCIF, which is an extension of the CIF format was phased in. mmCIF became the standard format for the PDB archive in 2014. In 2019, the wwPDB announced that depositions for crystallographic methods would only be accepted in mmCIF format.

An XML version of PDB, called PDBML, was described in 2005.
The structure files can be downloaded in any of these three formats, though an increasing number of structures do not fit the legacy PDB format. Individual files are easily downloaded into graphics packages from Internet URLs:
* For PDB format files, use, e.g., codice_1 or codice_2
* For PDBML (XML) files, use, e.g., codice_3 or codice_4
The &quot;codice_5&quot; is the PDB identifier. Each structure published in PDB receives a four-character alphanumeric identifier, its PDB ID. (This is not a unique identifier for biomolecules, because several structures for the same molecule—in different environments or conformations—may be contained in PDB with different PDB IDs.)

==Viewing the data==
The structure files may be viewed using one of several free and open source computer programs, including Jmol, Pymol, VMD, Molstar and Rasmol. Other non-free, shareware programs include ICM-Browser, MDL Chime, UCSF Chimera, Swiss-PDB Viewer, StarBiochem (a Java-based interactive molecular viewer with integrated search of protein databank), Sirius, and VisProt3DS (a tool for Protein Visualization in 3D stereoscopic view in anaglyph and other modes), and Discovery Studio. The RCSB PDB website contains an extensive list of both free and commercial molecule visualization programs and web browser plugins.

<doc id="102510" wikidata="Q1298115" url="?curid=102510" title="Eglin Air Force Base">
<text>Eglin Air Force Base is a United States Air Force (USAF) base in the western Florida panhandle, located about southwest of Valparaiso in Okaloosa County.

The host unit at Eglin is the 96th Test Wing (formerly the 96th Air Base Wing). The 96 TW is the test and evaluation center for Air Force air-delivered weapons, navigation and guidance systems, command and control systems, and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) systems.

Eglin AFB was established in 1935 as the Valparaiso Bombing and Gunnery Base. It is named in honor of Lt. Col. Frederick I. Eglin who was killed in a crash of his Northrop A-17 attack aircraft on a flight from Langley to Maxwell Field, Alabama.

==History==
===Creation and World War II===
Much of the base was part of a national forest until the outbreak of World War II in Europe when a proving ground for aircraft armament was established at Eglin. The U.S. Forest Service ceded over of the Choctawhatchee National Forest to the War Department on 18 October 1940.

Eglin Air Force Base evolved from the 1933 creation of the Valparaiso Airport, when an arrowhead-shaped parcel of was cleared for use as an airdrome.

In 1931, personnel of the Air Corps Tactical School, newly relocated to Maxwell Field, Alabama, sought a location for a bombing and gunnery range. They saw the potential of the sparsely populated forested areas surrounding Valparaiso and the vast expanse of the adjacent Gulf of Mexico.

From October 1941 to October 1945, a USAAF Fixed Gunnery School operated at the base, supervised by the 75th Flying Training Wing.

At its peak during World War II, the base employed more than 1,000 officers, 10,000 enlisted personnel and 4,000 civilians.

===Postwar===
After the war, Eglin became a pioneer in developing the techniques for missile launching and handling; and the development of drone or pilotless aircraft beginning with the Republic-Ford JB-2 Loon, an American copy of the V-1. The 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group was activated at Eglin Field, Florida, on 6 February 1946, operating out of Auxiliary Field 3. By March 1950, the 550th Guided Missiles Wing, comprising the 1st and 2nd Guided Missile Squadrons, had replaced the 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group. The 2nd Guided Missile Squadron, SSM, had 62 pilots manning 14 B-17s, three B-29s, and four F-80 Shooting Stars, yellow-tailed drone aircraft used in the role of testing guided missiles.

In December 1955, the Air Munitions Development Laboratory was reassigned from the Wright Air Development Center at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, to the Air Force Armament Center at Eglin by Headquarters Air Research and Development Command. The responsibility for development of guns, bombs, rockets, fuses, guided missile warheads and other related equipment in the armament field was transferred from the Dayton, Ohio facility at this time. Work on nuclear weapons was not included in this mission.

=== 1960s ===
The USAF Special Air Warfare Center was activated 27 April 1962, with the 1st Combat Applications Group (CAG) organized as a combat systems development and test agency under the SAWC. The 1st CAG concentrated on testing and evaluation of primarily short-term projects which might improve Air Force counter-insurgency (COIN) operations. The Special Air Warfare Center, located at Hurlburt Field, undertook to develop tactical air doctrine while training crews for special air warfare in places like Southeast Asia. By mid-1963, SAW groups were in Vietnam and Panama.

The USAF Tactical Air Warfare Center was activated on 1 November 1963. It would be re-designated as the USAF Air Warfare Center on 1 October 1991.

With the increasing U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia in the 1960s, the need for increased emphasis on conventional weapons development made Eglin&#x27;s mission even more important. On 1 August 1968, the Air Proving Ground Center was redesignated the Armament Development and Test Center to centralize responsibility for research, development, test and evaluation, and initial acquisition of non-nuclear munitions for the Air Force. On 1 October 1979, the center was given division status. The Armament Division, redesignated Munitions Systems Division on 15 March 1989, placed into production the precision-guided munitions for the laser, television, and infrared guided bombs; two anti-armor weapon systems; and an improved hard target weapon, the GBU-28, used in Operation Desert Storm during the Persian Gulf War. The Division was also responsible for developing the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), an Air Force-led joint project with the U.S. Navy.

===Late Cold War era===
The Air Force Armament Museum was founded on base in 1975. In 1981 the original building housing the museum was condemned and the facility closed until 1984.

Selected on 27 April 1975, the installation served as one of four main U.S. Vietnamese Refugee Processing Centers operated by the Interagency Task Force for Indochina Refugees, where base personnel housed and processed more than 10,000 Southeast Asian refugees, the first 374 of which arrived on board a Northwest Orient Boeing 747 on 4 May 1975.

In 1978, the USAF Tactical Air Warfare Center assumed responsibility for the USAF Air Ground Operations School. In the same year, the Electronic Warfare Evaluation Program became another one of the USAFTAWC&#x27;s weapons system evaluation programs, and resulted in the activation of the 4487th Electronic Warfare Aggressor Squadron in 1990.

Construction began in 1984 on the Bob Hope Village, the only retirement facility that caters to enlisted military, opening in February 1985. Residents pay below market value for the 256 independent apartments. Col. Bob Gates, Bob Hope&#x27;s USO pilot, was key in getting the comedian&#x27;s support for the undertaking, as well as lending his name to the project. He was named an honorary board member of the foundation in 1978 and held benefit concerts for nearly two decades.

===Post-Cold War===
During a 1992 reorganization, the Air Force disestablished Eglin&#x27;s parent major command, Air Force Systems Command (AFSC) and merged its functions with the former Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC). The newly created major command from this merger, Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), remains Eglin&#x27;s parent command to this day. The Development Test Center, Eglin&#x27;s host unit, became part of AFMC on 30 June 1992. The 46th Test Wing replaced the 3246th Test Wing in October 1992.

On 10 August 1994 construction began on the All Conflicts&#x27; Veterans War Memorial on the site of the old POW/MIA memorial on the western end of Eglin Boulevard. The memorial was dedicated on 15 August 1995.As part of the military drawdown in the 1990s, the Air Force inactivated the 33d Fighter Wing&#x27;s 59th Fighter Squadron on 15 April 1999. The wing lost six aircraft and consolidated the remaining aircraft into the 58th and 60th Fighter Squadrons. Originally selected for inactivation in 1997, Air Force officials delayed the decision in recognition of the Nomads&#x27; connection with Khobar Towers. The 59th reactivated as the 59th Test and Evaluation Squadron on 3 December 2004, at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. The 59th falls under the 53rd Test Management Group at Eglin.

In July 2012 the Air Armament Center was inactivated. The center had planned, directed and conducted test and evaluation of U.S. and allied air armament, navigation and guidance systems, and command and controlled systems. It operated two Air Force installations, providing host support not only to Eglin AFB, but also Kirtland AFB, New Mexico. It had included the Armament Product Directorate (Eglin), the 46th Test Wing (Eglin), the 96th Air Base Wing (Eglin), and the 377th Air Base Wing (Kirtland).

The US Navy&#x27;s VFA-101 &quot;Grim Reapers&quot; deactivated on 23 May 2019 after seven years of F-35C training at Eglin.

===Base railroad===

Initial construction of a railroad line into the region had been discussed as early as 1927 as part of the Choctawhatchee and Northern Railroad, though military-use proposals didn&#x27;t come forward until 1941. German POWs were used in clearing and grading the alignment during World War II. There was one commercial customer served by the line, a lumber pulp yard at Niceville which is now community athletic fields. The line was later abandoned in the late 1970s and the southern end, west of State Road 285, lifted by the mid-1980s.

==Role and operations==
Eglin is an Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) base serving as the focal point for all Air Force armaments. Eglin is responsible for the development, acquisition, testing, deployment and sustainment of all air-delivered non-nuclear weapons.

The base plans, directs, and conducts test and evaluation of U.S. and allied air armament, navigation and guidance systems, and command and control systems.

Severe-weather testing of aircraft and other equipment is carried out here at the McKinley Climatic Laboratory.

The residential portion of the base is a census-designated place; its population was 8,082 at the 2000 census. Eglin Air Force Base had 2,359 military family housing units. Unmarried junior enlisted members generally live in one of Eglin&#x27;s seven dormitories located near the dining hall, chapel, base gym, enlisted club, and bus lines on base. Each individual unit generally handles dormitory assignments. Bachelor Officer Quarters are not available. Several units and one dormitory were being renovated in 2011. The base covers 463,128 acres (1,874.2 km / 723.6 sqm).

===Major units===
====96th Test Wing (96 TW)====
The 96 TW is the test and evaluation wing for Air Force air-delivered weapons, navigation and guidance systems, command and control (C2) systems, and Air Force Special Operations Command systems. The Eglin Gulf Test Range provides approximately of over water airspace. The 96 TW supports other tenant units on the installation with traditional military services as well as all the services of a small city, to include civil engineering, personnel, logistics, communications, computer, medical, security. The 96 TW reports to the Air Force Test Center at Edwards AFB.

====33d Fighter Wing (33 FW)====
The 33d FW &quot;Nomads&quot; is the largest tenant unit at Eglin. The 33 FW is a joint graduate flying and maintenance training wing for the F-35 Lightning II, organized under Air Education and Training Command&#x27;s 19th Air Force. First established as the 33d Pursuit Group, the wing&#x27;s contribution to tactical airpower during its 50-year history has been significant with participation in campaigns around the world, while flying various fighter aircraft. Reactivated at Eglin on 1 April 1965 with F-4C Phantom IIs, the wing operated, successively, F-4D and E models into the 1970s before transitioning to the F-15 Eagle. As of 1 October 2009, the 33d FW transitioned to a training wing for the new F-35. The final F-15s assigned to the 33d departed the base in September 2009. As the first of its kind in the Department of Defense, the joint wing is responsible for F-35 pilot and maintainer training for the Air Force, Marine Corps and the Navy. The first of 59 F-35s arrived from Lockheed Martin Fort Worth, Texas on 14 July 2011.

=====58th Fighter Squadron=====
The 58th FS &quot;Mighty Gorillas&quot; are authorized to operate 24 assigned F-35A aircraft, planning and executing a training curriculum in support of USAF and international partner pilot training requirements. The F-35A is a conventional take-off and landing, low-observable, multi-role fighter aircraft, designed with 5th-generation sensors and weapons, and is able to perform air superiority, air interdiction and close air support missions. The F-35A made its first flight on 15 December 2006.

====53d Wing (53 WG)====
The 53 WG is headquartered at Eglin and serves as the USAF&#x27;s focal point for operational test and evaluation of armament and avionics, aircrew training devices, chemical defense, aerial reconnaissance improvements, electronic warfare systems, and is responsible for the QF-4 Phantom II Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) program and subscale drone programs (located at Tyndall AFB, Florida). The wing tests every fighter, bomber, unmanned aerial vehicle, and associated weapon system in the Air Force inventory. The wing reports to the United States Air Force Warfare Center  at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, a Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) to Headquarters, Air Combat Command (ACC).

=====49th Test and Evaluation Squadron (49 TES) =====
The 49 TES is attached to the 53d Wing but located at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. The squadron plans, executes and reports ACC&#x27;s weapon system evaluation programs for bombers (B-52, B-1 and B-2) and nuclear-capable fighters (F-15E Strike Eagle and F-16). These evaluations include operational effectiveness and suitability, command and control, performance of aircraft hardware and software systems, employment tactics, and accuracy and reliability of associated precision weapons. These weapons include air-launched cruise missiles, standoff missiles, and gravity bombs. Results and conclusions support acquisition decisions and development of war plans. The unit also performs operational testing on new systems and tactics development for the B-52.

==== Armament Directorate ====
The Armament Directorate located at Eglin is responsible for management of air and ground dominance weapon system programs. Led by the Air Force Program Executive Officer for Weapons, the directorate concurrently reports to the Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Washington, D.C., and the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

====Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW)====
AFRL/RW develops, demonstrates, and transitions science and technology for air-launched munitions for defeating ground fixed, mobile/relocatable, air and space targets to assure pre-eminence of U.S. air and space forces. The directorate conducts basic research, exploratory development, and advanced development and demonstrations. It also participates in programs focused on technology transfer, dual-use technology and small business development.

====7th Special Forces Group (7th SFG)====
In 2011, the United States Army&#x27;s 7th Special Forces Group relocated to a newly constructed cantonment on the Eglin Air Force Base reservation from Fort Bragg, as part of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round realigning Fort Bragg. It is tasked with conducting special operations in Latin America.

===Tenant units===
Tenant units at an Air Force installation are units which have a mission that is significantly different from that of the host unit, and rely heavily upon the host unit for day-to-day operations (sewer, power, security, recreation).

====6th Ranger Training Battalion (6th RTB)====
Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field No. 6 (Biancur Field) is the site of Camp James E. Rudder and the home of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 6th Ranger Training Battalion. The 6th RTB conducts the final phase of the U.S. Army Ranger Course. The entire course is 61 days long and is divided into three phases. Each phase is conducted at different geographical and environmental locations.

====20th Space Control Squadron (20 SPCS)====
The mission of the 20 SPCS is to detect, track, identify, and report near Earth and deep space objects in Earth&#x27;s orbit, and provide space object identification data in support of United States Space Command&#x27;s space control mission. A unit of the United States Space Force (USSF), the men and women of the 20th SPCS operate and maintain the AN/FPS-85 radar, the Space Force&#x27;s only phased-array radar dedicated to tracking Earth-orbiting objects.

====323 Squadron RNLAF====
Royal Netherlands Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation squadron, operates 2 F-35A

====486th Flight Test Squadron (486th FLTS)====
This unit, which is apparently not a test squadron at all, operates Boeing C-32Bs in discrete missions for the United States Department of State&#x27;s Foreign Emergency Support Team.

====919th Special Operations Wing (919 SOW)====
The 919 SOW, located about south of Crestview and from Eglin main at Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field No. 3 (Duke Field) and is the only special operations wing in the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). In wartime or a contingency, the 919 SOW reports to Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) at Hurlburt Field, Florida, its gaining major command.

====AFOTEC Det 2====
The Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center stood up Detachment 2 at Eglin to provide realistic operational testing for new and modified weapon systems.

====Naval School of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)====
The Naval School of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (NAVSCOLEOD) is a Navy-managed command, jointly staffed by Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps personnel. NAVSCOLEOD opened its new consolidated training facility in April 1999.

====Joint Assessment Division (JAD)====
Directorate of the Joint Staff, JAD (formerly the Joint Deployable Analysis Team) conducts field analysis of CJADC2 C2 information systems and procedures producing decision-quality data to improve Joint C2 integration and interoperability.

===Scheduled airline service===
Eglin is also one of the few military air bases in the U.S. to have scheduled passenger airline service as the Destin–Fort Walton Beach Airport (VPS) is co-located on the base property.

==Based units==
Flying and notable non-flying units based at Eglin Air Force Base.

Units marked GSU are Geographically Separate Units, which although based at Eglin, are subordinate to a parent unit based at another location.

==Eglin auxiliary fields==
A number of auxiliary fields were constructed on the Eglin reservation during World War II, many of which are still in service in various roles, either in support of flight operations or special test activities.
* Auxiliary Field 1 (Wagner Field)

: Work on Auxiliary Field 1 began 27 November 1940. Auxiliary Field 1 is named Wagner Field for Maj. Walter J. Wagner, former commanding officer for the 1st Proving Ground, Eglin Field, who was killed 19 October 1943 in the crash of a Douglas XA-26B, s/n 41-19588, 9 miles east of Eglin Field, Valpariso, FL. Much of the Doolittle Raid and Operation Credible Sport training took place here. The U.S. Navy used the field as an auxiliary facility for pilot training out of Whiting Field for a time, dating from early 1960. A proposal by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to build a multi-million dollar research installation for testing rocket fuels and components at Field 1 in early 1960 was dropped in mid-February, the chief reason for consideration being abandoned &quot;was the possibility the military would have other uses for the field in the near future.&quot; It is also known as Site C-5. Range C-72 extends SE from Wagner Field.
* Auxiliary Field 2 (Pierce Field)

: Auxiliary Field 2 is named Pierce Field for Lt. Col. George E. Pierce, killed 19 October 1942 while piloting a North American B-25C-1 Mitchell which crashed into the Gulf of Mexico S of Destin, Florida. Joe Baugher cites date of 19 October 1942 for loss. It is also known as Site C-3. Between November 1966 and 1970, it was the site of the 560th Civil Engineering Squadron, also known as the Civil Engineering Field Activities Center, for the training of Red Horse personnel.
* Auxiliary Field 3 (Duke Field)

: Auxiliary Field 3 is named Duke Field for 1st Lt Robert L. Duke, killed in the crash of a Curtiss A-25A-20-CS Shrike near Spencer, Tennessee, on 29 December 1943. He was assigned as Assistant A-3 of Eglin Field. Used as the set for the fictional 918th Bomb Group in the 1949 film &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot;. Field 3 was long-associated with drone operations of the 3200th and 3205th Drone Groups. Aircraft were &quot;sanitized&quot; (stripped of all identification) here for the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba.
* Auxiliary Field 4 (Peel Field)

: Auxiliary Field 4 is named Peel Field for 2nd Lt. Garland O. Peel Jr., who died in the take-off crash of a Martin B-12AM of the 387th School Squadron, 2 January 1942, when he suffered engine failure. He was a gunnery school instructor at Eglin. Peel Field was utilized for the filming of scenes for the 1944 film &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;. Wartime temporary housing for NCOs located here was razed in the 1960s. In the early 1960s, while in a moribund state, one of the runways was used as an unofficial auto drag strip by local civilians. The ramp of the non-flight-rated facility now serves as a vehicle park for aircraft and armor after being expended as targets on the Eglin ranges.
* Auxiliary Field 5 (Piccolo Field)

: Auxiliary Field 5 is named Piccolo Field for Capt. Anthony D. Piccolo, who died in the crash of a North American AT-6A-NT Texan on 6 October 1942. Piccolo was the commanding officer of the 386th Single Engine Gunnery Training Squadron at Eglin. Today, the area is due north of Field Four and serves as a microwave station. A 60-foot radar antenna was installed here in April 1961. On most base maps, it is identified as Site C-4. Doolittle Raid training was conducted here.
* Auxiliary Field 6 (Biancur Field)

: Auxiliary Field 6 is named Biancur Field for 1st Lt. Andrew Biancur, a test pilot of the Medium Bombardment Section of the 1st Proving Ground Group, killed 8 January 1944 in the crash of a Northrop YP-61-NO Black Widow at Eglin Field. The U.S. Army Ranger facility Camp Rudder is located here. It is designated Site B-6. The X-43A-LS low-speed demonstrator underwent testing out of Auxiliary Field 6 in November 2003.
* Auxiliary Field 7 (Epler Field)

: Auxiliary Field 7 is named Epler Field for Col. Robin E. Epler, deputy commander (Technical) of the Air Proving Ground Command, Eglin Field, Florida, killed 28 January 1944 in the crash of a Douglas A-20G-10-DO Havoc NE of Crestview, Florida. It is designated Site B-12.
* Auxiliary Field 8 (Baldsiefen Field)

: Auxiliary Field 8 is named Baldsiefen Field for 2nd Lt. Richard Edward Baldsiefen, a gunnery instructor at Eglin, killed 4 March 1942 along with Lt. John W. Smith, in the crash of a North American AT-6A-NA Texan which came down at Auxiliary Field 4. It is designated Site C-52C.
* Auxiliary Field 9 (Hurlburt Field)

: Auxiliary Field 9 is named Hurlburt Field for Lt. Donald Wilson Hurlburt, killed 1 October 1943 when his Lockheed AT-18-LO Hudson gunnery trainer crashed during take-off at Eglin. After flying Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress combat missions from Great Britain and receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC), Hurlburt was assigned in mid-1943 to the First Proving Ground Electronics Test Unit at Eglin Field. Field 9 was named in his honor by base commander General Grandison Gardner. Hurlburt&#x27;s nephew was Captain Craig D. Button (noted for his mysterious flight and crash of an A-10 Thunderbolt on 2 April 1997). An official history of Eglin AFB&#x27;s early years cites 2 October 1943 as the date of this accident.
* Auxiliary Field 10 (Dillon Field)

: Auxiliary Field 10 is the westernmost of the wartime Eglin airfields, located in Santa Rosa County, and is named Dillon Field for Capt. Barclay H. Dillon, test pilot of the Fighter Section of the 1st Proving Ground Group, killed 2 October 1943 when his Lockheed P-38J-5-LO Lightning crashed W of Milton, Florida. Field 10 was later named Eglin Dillon Airdrome. Now used primarily for U.S. Navy basic flight training, the Navy refers to it as Naval Outlying Landing Field Choctaw (NOLF). It is also used for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle [UAV] training, and it is expected that F-35 Lightning IIs assigned to the 33d Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force Base will utilize NOLF Choctaw for training.
* Auxiliary Field 11 is an unconfirmed name for a Red Horse unsurfaced east–west airstrip that shows up on Google Earth in Walton County.
* The Santa Rosa Island Range Complex is part of the Eglin overwater range that provides 86,500 square miles of overwater airspace that is jointly used for a variety of test and evaluation activities and training exercises.

==Demographics==
Eglin employs more than 8,500 civilians and approximately 4,500 military, with an additional 2,200 jobs due to move to Eglin under the 2005 BRAC.

The Eglin AFB census-designated place (CDP), referred to simply as the Eglin CDP until the 2010 census, had a population of 3,006 at the 2020 census, up from 2,274 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Crestview–Fort Walton Beach–Destin metropolitan area.

About 4.5% of families and 4.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.5% of those under the age of 18 and none of those 65 and older.

==National historic status==
There are two U.S. National Historic Landmark Districts with connections to the base: Camp Pinchot and Eglin Field.

On 6 October 1997, the McKinley Climatic Laboratory was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

==Notable residents==
* Author Hunter S Thompson was stationed on Eglin from 1956 until 1958 during his enlistment with the Air Force.
* Infielder Jay Bell was born in the base hospital in 1965.
* NASCAR Cup Series driver Aric Almirola was born in Eglin in 1984.
* John Boyd, USAF officer and military strategist who developed the Energy–maneuverability theory while stationed at Eglin.
* Professional cyclist Neilson Powless, first rider of Native American ancestry to compete in the Tour de France, was born at Eglin.

==Eglin AFB in pop culture==
* Movies that have been filmed in part at Eglin Air Force Base or its outlying auxiliary airfields, &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; in 1944, &quot;Twelve O&#x27; Clock High&quot; in 1949, &quot;On the Threshold of Space&quot; in 1955 and &quot;Search for Paradise&quot; in 1956.
* Thirteen airmen assigned to the 48th Recovery Squadron played a part in the 1965 James Bond movie &quot;Thunderball&quot;. The airmen, all highly skilled paratroopers, assisted in a sky diving scene filmed in Miami Beach. They jumped out of an HC-97 in Biscayne Bay at an altitude of 1,500 feet. A quote from TSgt Lewis Roberts said, &quot;We played the good guys and were helping James Bond destroy the villains who were about to blow up the East Coast.&quot;
* Several Tom Clancy novels refer to &quot;raking the sand traps on the officers&#x27; golf course&quot; at Eglin as a common activity for low-security prisoners at the associated Federal Prison Camp, Eglin, now closed.
* F-15 Eagles from Eglin&#x27;s 33rd Fighter Wing, 59th Fighter Squadron, were used in the filming of the 1997 movie &quot;Air Force One&quot;.
* Eglin AFB appears as the default airport in the simulation software Prepar3D.

==Geography==

===Flora and fauna===
The forests and shores of Eglin Air Force Base are at the center of one of the most biodiverse locations in North America. Over 50 species threatened in Florida are found on the base, including sea turtles that nest on its white-sand beaches and red-cockaded woodpeckers that thrive in its longleaf pine forests. The base has a natural resources management team that constantly monitors important species within the base with the goal of balancing their national defense mission with environmental stewardship. Longleaf pine forest, a forest type reduced to 5% of its former range in the last few centuries, covers of the base. Part of this forest, , is old growth, making the base home to one of the most extensive old-growth longleaf pine forests in the world.

===Climate===
Warm, subtropical weather lasts longer than the average summer. The annual precipitation ranges from . Year-round, the average temperatures run:

January–March: 60–69 High and 42–51 LowApril–June: 76–88 High and 58–72 LowJuly–September: 86–98 High and 70–77 LowOctober–December: 63–79 High and 44–69 Low

The area gets only 50 to 60 days of annual precipitation or more rainfall. There are few days without sunshine, which allows year-round outdoor activities.

===Noise===
In order to deal with the high noise levels of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, officials from Santa Rosa, Okaloosa and Walton counties are studying which homes, businesses and public buildings will require additional noise protection.

==Civil rocketry==
Eglin Air Force Base was also a launch site for civil rockets of NASA. There are three launch pads: one at 29.6700 N, 85.3700 W at Cape San Blas; and two on Santa Rosa Island at 30.3800 N, 86.7400 W and 30.3800 N, 86.8170 W. Rockets launched here have included Arcas, Nike Cajun, Nike Apaches, and Nike Iroquois. This site was formerly operated by the 4751st ADMS with CIM-10 Bomarcs, which inactivated in 1979. In the 1940s, captured V-1 flying bombs and American copies, Republic-Ford JB-2 LOONs, were launched out over the Gulf of Mexico from these sites. Two concrete launch ramps were placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. A rusting Loon launch ramp still exists at Auxiliary Field 1, Wagner Field.

Eglin is known to have been used for 441 launches from 1959 to 1980, reaching up to 686 kilometers altitude.

==Amateur radio restrictions==
The US Code of Federal Regulations specifies that amateur radio operators within 322 kilometers of Eglin must not transmit with more than 50 watts of power on the 70-centimeter band.

<text>A coalition is formed when two or more people or groups temporarily work together to achieve a common goal. The term is most frequently used to denote a formation of power in political, military, or economical spaces.

== Formation ==
According to &quot;A Guide for Political Parties&quot; published by the National Democratic Institute and the Oslo Center for Peace and Human Rights, there are five steps to coalition building. The first step in coalition building involves &quot;developing a party strategy&quot; that will prepare for successful negotiation. The more effort parties place on this step, the more likely they are to identify strategic partners, negotiate a good deal and avoid some of the common mistakes associated with coalition building. 

The second step is &quot;negotiating a coalition&quot;. Based on the strategy that each party has prepared, the parties come together to negotiate and reach an agreement on the coalition terms. Depending on the context and objectives of the coalition, these negotiations may be completely secret or partially public. While some issues may be agreed on with relative ease, others may be more contentious and require different approaches to reach compromise.

As negotiation concludes, the agreement between political parties needs to be formally sealed. This third step includes finalizing a written agreement, securing formal approval of the deal from the relevant structures of the coalition’s member parties and announcing the coalition details to the general public. The next step involves &quot;working in coalition&quot;. As the coalition partners begin working to implement their agreement, they will need to maintain good relations by continuing efforts to increase or sustain trust and communication among the member parties. Each party will also need to find a balance between respecting its obligations to the coalition and maintaining its individual identity. 

The final step is to &quot;identify lessons learned&quot;. Regardless of whether it plans to move forward alone or in another coalition, it is important for each party to review and document lessons learned from each coalition-building experience. This will make it possible to get a clearer picture of the positive and negative impacts of coalition-building on the party and to identify lessons learned that can inform any future coalition-building efforts.

Coalitions manifest in a variety of forms, types, and terms of duration. Campaign coalitions are high intensity and involve long-term cooperation. Federations are characterized by a relatively lower degree of involvement, intensity, and participation, also involving long-term cooperation but with members&#x27; primary commitment remaining with their own entities. Instrumental coalitions have low-intensity involvement without a foundation to mediate conflict. Finally, event-based coalitions are those that have a high level of involvement and the potential for future collaboration.

In contrast to alliances, coalitions may be termed &quot;partnerships of unequals&quot;, since comparative political, economic, and military might, as well as the extent to which a nation is prepared to commit to the coalition, dictate influence. Coalitions can often occur as unplanned responses to situations of danger, uncertainty, or extraordinary events, directed at interim objectives.

== Function ==
Coalitions can be classified as internal or external. Internal coalitions consist of people who are already in an organization, such as a workplace. For example, a trade union is a type of coalition formed to represent employees&#x27; wages, benefits, and working conditions. Without this unity between employees, workers may be subjugated to harsh working environments and low pay due to no practical regulations. Often, organizations prefer to meet with members of their respective internal coalitions before implementing changes in the workplace to ensure support.

In contrast, external coalitions consist of people that are members of different organizations who collaborate their efforts to achieve an overall objective. For example, in order to prevent gun violence and advocate gun control, several groups, unions, and nonprofit organizations banded together to form the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. External coalitions base their confidence in gaining credibility on inviting unlikely partners who wish to attain the same end goal, even if the reasons to achieve the goal differ.

== Use ==

=== Government and politics === 
Coalition government is an alternative model to a majority government, the latter being prevalent in winner-take-all first-past-the-post electoral systems that favor clear distinctions between winners and losers. Not only can coalitions of legislative groups form governments in parliamentary systems, they can also form in divisions of power. Most typical analyses of coalitions in politics deal with the formation of multiparty cabinets in parliamentary regimes. In Germany, every administration has been a multiparty coalition since the conclusion of the Second World Waran example of coalition government creation in a parliamentary system. When different winning coalitions can be formed in a parliament, the party composition of the government may depend on the bargaining power of each party and the presence or lack of a dominant party.

Coalitions are similar to parliamentary groups. Fluid coalitions, which change with each vote, exist in the European Parliament and Swiss parliament to pass legislation.

=== International relations ===

The temporary collaboration of two or more separate parties with a set goal and common purpose can be viewed as a coalition in international relations. Coalition competitions are represented in international political dynamics. A coalition can be an &quot;ad hoc&quot; grouping of nations united for specific purposes. Although persons and groups form coalitions for many and varied reasons, the most common purpose is to combat a common threat or to take advantage of a certain opportunity, resulting in the often temporary nature of coalitions. The common threat or existence of opportunity is what gives rise to the coalition and allows it to exist as all parties involved see the benefit in working together. Such collaborative processes allow the actors of the coalition to approach a common goal or accomplish the same task. The behavior and dynamics of coalitions in international relations are created by commonalities and differences within the groups joining together. Rationality, group dynamics, and gender are all contributing factors of coalitional behaviors in an international security framework.

=== Economics ===
Economic agents can form coalitions. When a coalition is formed around economic goals, the reasoning is financial. In economics, when two opposing sectors, such as a buyer and seller or two sellers, come together, it can be thought of as a coalition in the denotative sense, as the two groups come together temporarily to achieve a goal. One example would be the 1997 deal between Microsoft and Apple. The deal consisted of Microsoft rescuing the then-struggling Apple with a cash infusion of $150 million. Unions can be viewed as coalitions of workers, usually of the same job sector. When the agents considered are countries, the formation of an international treaty (e.g. trade agreements or international environmental agreements) can also be seen as a coalition. In economics, a coalition&#x27;s formation and its stability is mostly studied using game theory.

=== Civil society ===
In civil society, a coalition denotes a group effort or a population of people coming together who believe strongly in their cause. The term also describes alliances between civil society organizations, such as labor unions, community organizations, and religious institutions. In France for example, workers from different sectors and unions band together to aid each other in communicating a point. This coalition of unions is often very effective as it can cause massive inconvenience to the country. The formation of coalitions such as the Community-Labor Coalition have proven to be an important strategy for social change in many contexts. In social groups, a coalition often forms from private citizens uniting behind a common goal or purpose, sometimes within a coalitional identity. Many of these private citizen groups form grassroots organizations, such as the Christian Coalition, which is the largest grassroots political group in the US. Activist groups in civil society are also viewed as coalitions for their respective cause. These activists are joined together by their belief in what they want to achieve or accomplish.

=== Military ===

Military coalitions can be built and united under a singular power by multiple states and governments. They are fluid in terms of membershipnot only does a country not have to have been a traditional ally to join a coalition, but nations can join, vary their contributions and caveats, withdraw, and be replaced by new members as the situation changes or national agendas change. The expansion of assets accessible to member nations to perform military operations is a crucial attribute of coalitions. In many ways, coalition warfare serves to make the crafting of a peace more difficult than winning the war itself. An example of such a coalition happened after World War I during the 1919 Versailles Peace Conference, when the Allied powers attempted to reach a peace agreement.

Examples of military coalitions include the Coalition of the Gulf War, when George H. W. Bush ended Saddam Hussein&#x27;s aggression in the Middle East by enlisting and leading a military coalition in the 1991 Gulf War&#x27;s Operation Desert Storm as well as his son George W. Bush&#x27;s efforts in the Coalition of the Willing, a phrase employed during the 2003 campaign for the war in Iraq led by the US and its allies. A contemporary example is the United Nations coalition that intervened in the 2011 Libyan Civil War against Muammar Gaddafi. For coalitions to be effective in principle or in action, participating nations have tended to require a single overpowering threatperhaps to freedom or a way of life or a crucial national interestor the presence of a single despotic figure or regime whose continued existence is considered not only abhorrent to the generality of nations but also destabilizing to the region or world order.

=== Mathematics ===
In mathematics, the term &quot;coalition&quot; is linked to an equation which uses the coalition model for exponential population growth. This analytical equation was first published by mathematician Pierre François Verhulst in 1838 to allow for the approximation of the world&#x27;s population at a given time by applying differential and integral techniques.

<doc id="102516" wikidata="Q2071504" url="?curid=102516" title="Nemesis (Asimov novel)">
<text>Nemesis is a science fiction novel by American writer Isaac Asimov. One of his later science fiction novels, it was published in 1989, three years before his death. This novel is connected to Asimov&#x27;s other works by several ideas from earlier and later novels, including non-human intelligence, sentient astronomical bodies (&quot;Hallucination&quot;), and rotor engines (&quot;Fantastic Voyage II: Destination Brain&quot;).

==Plot summary==
The novel is set in an era in which interstellar travel is in the process of being discovered and perfected. In Chapter 2, the novel states that the year 2220 was 16 years ago. Accordingly, the bulk of the novel takes place in or around the year 2236.

Before the novel&#x27;s opening, &quot;hyper-assistance&quot;, a technology allowing travel just shy of the speed of light, is used to move a reclusive space station colony called &quot;Rotor&quot; from the vicinity of Earth to the newly discovered red dwarf Nemesis. There, it takes up orbit around the semi-habitable moon Erythro, named for the red light that falls on it.

It is eventually discovered that the bacterial life on Erythro forms a collective organism that possesses a form of consciousness and telepathy (a concept similar to the Gaia of Asimov&#x27;s Foundation series). While the colonists argue over the direction of future colonization—down to Erythro, or up to the asteroid belts of Nemesis system—events catch up with them. Back on Earth superluminal flight is perfected, ending Rotor Colony&#x27;s isolation and opening the galaxy to human exploration.

The story also relates the breakup and reunion of a family. The mother, who discovered Nemesis, and her daughter were separated from the Earthbound father when the colony departed. The father then becomes part of the hyperjump research project as a result. Important in the novel is the startling discovery that the bacterial inhabitants of Erythro collectively constitute a sentient and telepathic organism and the discovery and resolution of a massive crisis: Nemesis&#x27; trajectory threatens to gravitationally destabilize the Solar System.

==Story notes==

The demands of the plot required Asimov to hypothesize a planetary system about a star named Nemesis. At the time of the writing, the name Nemesis was given to a hypothetical companion to Earth&#x27;s Sun that could provide a mechanism for periodic disturbances of comets in the Oort cloud, which would then fall inwards causing mass extinctions. The red dwarf star in the book turns out not to be this companion; it is simply passing through the Solar System.

The planetary system in the book included a gas giant planet named Megas in a very short-period orbit about its primary star. (Erythro is a moon of Megas.) This was a radical idea in 1989, but was vindicated with the discovery of the first extrasolar planet orbiting a sun-like star (51 Pegasi) in 1995, dubbed &quot;Bellerophon&quot;. Furthermore, the first speculated &quot;habitable&quot; planet discovered, Gliese 581c, orbits a red dwarf star (Gliese 581) located only 20.3 light years from Earth—a notable similarity to the novel wherein Erythro is the first inhabited extra–solar body.

In the foreword of the novel, Asimov stated that &quot;Nemesis&quot; is not a part of the &quot;Foundation&quot; universe that consists of the &quot;Foundation&quot;, &quot;Robot&quot;, and &quot;Empire&quot; series. In his autobiography he said that it was in fact his editor Jennifer Brehl who had suggested a novel which was &quot;not part of either the &quot;Foundation&quot; series or the &quot;Robot&quot; series, but ... an entirely independent background.&quot; In the foreword he also stated that he may change his mind on the matter.
Some have suspected that the radiation from the star Nemesis may have been intended to be another possible reason for the radiation on Earth forcing emigration. However, Nemesis is referred to in &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot;, where Hari Seldon refers to a twenty-thousand-year-old story of &quot;a young woman that could communicate with an entire planet that circled a sun named Nemesis.&quot; A few commentators noted that &quot;Nemesis&quot; contains barely disguised references to the Spacers and their calendar system, the Galactic Empire and even to Hari Seldon which seem to have been deliberately placed for the purpose of later integration into the &quot;Foundation&quot; universe.

According to Alasdair Wilkins, in a discussion posted on Gizmodo, &quot;Asimov absolutely loves weird, elliptical structures. All three of his non-robot/Foundation science fiction novels — &quot;The End of Eternity&quot;, &quot;The Gods Themselves&quot;, and &quot;Nemesis&quot; — leaned heavily on non-chronological narratives, and he does it with gusto in &quot;The Gods Themselves&quot;.&quot;

== Major characters ==
* Dr. Eugenia Insigna Fisher: from the Euro-dominated Rotor Colony; astronomer for the Far Probe project; discoverer of Nemesis
* Crile Fisher: a fetcher (technological espionage operative) for Earth
* Marlene Fisher: homely daughter of Crile and Eugenia; can read body language exceptionally well
* Dr. Janus Pitt: Commissioner of Rotor; enemy of Eugenia, Crile, and Marlene
* Siever Genarr: Erythro Dome Chief, former admirer of Eugenia
* Ranay D&#x27;Aubisson: Chief Neurophysicist of the Erythro Dome
* Dr. Tessa Anita Wendel: from Adelia Colony; Chief Physicist in Superluminal Theory
* Kattimoro Tanayama: Director of Earth Intelligence
* Igor Koropatsky: Tanayama&#x27;s successor after he dies
* Aurinel Pampas: attractive 17-year-old boy on whom Marlene has a crush

== Reception ==
On Kirkus Reviews, the novel is said to be &quot;a medium-future space drama, often quite absorbing despite the absence of a theme or even much of a plot&quot; and a &quot;low-key, oddly likable performance considering that, despite all the complicated maneuvering, nothing much happens: the old Asimov charm keeps the pages turning&quot;.

According to SF Site, Isaac Asimov seems to &quot;feel[s] obliged to apologize for the fact that it is completely unrelated to any of his own novels&quot;. &quot;Nemesis&quot; turns out to be &quot;in fact nothing more than an average Isaac Asimov novel&quot; with good and bad points summarized as follows: &quot;On the positive side, that means that it has intelligent and thoughtful ideas, a carefully crafted plot, and a well-maintained sense of suspense. On the negative side, that means that it offers generally perfunctory characterization, an undistinguished prose style, and an excessive emphasis on endless conversation—as in a soap opera, Asimov&#x27;s characters spend far more time talking about what they are doing than actually doing anything.&quot;

<doc id="102518" wikidata="Q1785694" url="?curid=102518" title="List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees">
<text>The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, established in 1983 and located in Cleveland, Ohio, United States, is dedicated to recording the history of some of the best-known and most influential musicians, bands, producers, and others that have in some major way influenced the music industry, particularly in the area of rock and roll. Originally, there were four categories of induction: performers, non-performers, early influences, and lifetime achievement. In 2000, &quot;sidemen&quot; was introduced as a category.

The only category that has seen new inductees every single year is the performers category. Artists become eligible for induction in that category 25 years after the release of their first record. In order to be inducted, an artist must be nominated by a committee that selects a number of candidates, the highest being 16 for the 2020 class. Ballots are then sent to more than 1,000 &quot;rock experts&quot; who evaluate the candidates and vote on who should be inducted. The performers that receive the highest number of votes are inducted. This number varies; for example, seven were inducted in 2019. Starting in 2012, fans could vote on a fan ballot with an equal weight to the other ballots. , new inductees are honored at an annual ceremony held alternately in New York and at the Hall of Fame in Cleveland; prior to that, the ceremonies rotated between Cleveland, New York, and Los Angeles.

== Inductees ==
=== Performers ===
The performers category is meant for recording artists and bands that have &quot;influence and significance to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll&quot;.

Note 1. These backing bands were inducted by a separate committee, and not by the ballot voting used for all other performer inductees.

Note 2. This artist was later inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after inducting someone else.

Note 3. This artist was already a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when they inducted someone else.

Note 4. Dire Straits were the first artist in the hall&#x27;s history to not have an official induction speaker. Band member John Illsley did the induction speech himself.

Note 5. John Gustafson was originally included among the list of inducted members for Roxy Music; however, his name was dropped in the final list.

Note 6. In 2012, six additional bands and groups were inducted as performers by a special committee, due to the controversial nature of their band being excluded when their lead singer was inducted. &quot;There was a lot of discussion about this,&quot; said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. &quot;There had always been conversations about why the groups weren&#x27;t included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question – it was so long ago... We decided we&#x27;d sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result.&quot;

Note 7. Although Pat Benatar is a solo artist, her husband, guitarist and primary musical partner Neil Giraldo was also included as part of her induction.

Note 8. There was no induction speaker for the Spinners. Instead, New Edition performed a medley of three of their songs.

=== Early/musical influences ===
Artists inducted into the early influences category were originally for those &quot;whose music predated rock and roll but had an impact on the evolution of rock and roll and inspired rock&#x27;s leading artists&quot;. Unlike the performers category, these inductees are selected by a committee. In 2023, the award was renamed from &quot;Early influence&quot; to &quot;Musical influence&quot;.

A. Previously nominated as a performer: Wanda Jackson in 2005 and 2009; Freddie King in 2012; The &quot;5&quot; Royales in 2002 and 2004; Sister Rosetta Tharpe in 2016; Kraftwerk in 2003, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020; and Link Wray in 2014 and 2018.

=== Non-performers (Ahmet Ertegun Award) ===
The non-performer category honors &quot;songwriters, producers, disc jockeys, record executives, journalists and other industry professionals who have had a major influence on the development of rock and roll&quot;. Several of the inductees in this category were in fact prominent performers as well. The inductees in this category are selected by the same committee that chooses the early influences. In 2008, this category was renamed the &quot;Ahmet Ertegun Award&quot;.

=== Award for Musical Excellence ===
Established in 2000 as &quot;Sidemen&quot;, the category &quot;honors those musicians, producers and others who have spent their careers out of the spotlight working with major artists on various parts of their recording and live careers&quot;. A separate committee, composed mainly of producers, chooses the inductees. In 2010, the category was renamed to the &quot;Award for Musical Excellence&quot;. According to Joel Peresman, the president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, &quot;This award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized.&quot;

A. Previously nominated in the performers category: King Curtis in 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1996; LL Cool J in 2010, 2011, 2014, 2018, 2019, and 2021; Judas Priest in 2018, 2020, and 2022; Chaka Khan in 2016, 2017, and 2021; MC5 in 2003, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2022; and Dionne Warwick in 2021 and 2022.

=== Singles ===
At the 2018 ceremony, a new induction category for singles was announced by Steven Van Zandt. According to Van Zandt, the category is &quot;a recognition of the excellence of the singles that shaped rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, kind of a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll jukebox, records by artists not in the Rock Hall – which is not to say these artists will never be in the Rock Hall. They just are not in the Rock Hall at the moment.&quot; However, The Isley Brothers, whose song &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; was inducted in 2019, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as performers in 1992. In 2023, Link Wray, whose song &quot;Rumble&quot; was inducted in 2018, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a Musical Influence inductee.

== Individuals inducted twice or more ==
As of 2024, twenty-seven performers have been inducted twice or more; fifteen have been recognized as a solo artist and with a band, and eight have been inducted with two separate bands. Eric Clapton is the only one to be inducted three times: as a solo artist, with Cream, and with The Yardbirds. Clyde McPhatter was the first to ever be inducted twice and is one of three artists to be inducted first as a solo artist and then as a member of a band, the other artists being Neil Young and Rod Stewart. Stephen Stills is the only artist to be inducted twice in the same year.

Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash and The Beatles are the only two bands whose members were also each inducted separately, with other acts or as solo artists. In addition to their 1997 induction with CSN, David Crosby was inducted with The Byrds in 1991, Stephen Stills with Buffalo Springfield in 1997, and Graham Nash with The Hollies in 2010. Beatles members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison were inducted as solo artists in the main performer category, while Ringo Starr was inducted in the Award for Musical Excellence category.

There are several performers who were inducted with one (or more) of the bands they played for, but were not inducted as members of one (or more) other bands. For example, Neil Young was inducted with Buffalo Springfield and as a solo artist, but was left out when Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash were inducted.

In 2019, Stevie Nicks became the first woman to be inducted twice, after having been inducted with Fleetwood Mac in 1998. She was later joined by Carole King and Tina Turner. In 2021, Carole King was the first person to be inducted as both a performer and a non-performer. 

John Lennon and Dave Grohl are the only two multiple inductees who were inducted in their first year of eligibility on both inductions.

<doc id="102519" wikidata="Q167741" url="?curid=102519" title="Dolomite (mineral)">
<text>Dolomite () is an anhydrous carbonate mineral composed of calcium magnesium carbonate, ideally The term is also used for a sedimentary carbonate rock composed mostly of the mineral dolomite (see Dolomite (rock)). An alternative name sometimes used for the dolomitic rock type is dolostone. 

==History==

As stated by Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure the mineral dolomite was probably first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1768. In 1791, it was described as a rock by the French naturalist and geologist Déodat Gratet de Dolomieu (1750–1801), first in buildings of the old city of Rome, and later as samples collected in the Tyrolean Alps. Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure first named the mineral (after Dolomieu) in March 1792.

==Properties==
The mineral dolomite crystallizes in the trigonal-rhombohedral system. It forms white, tan, gray, or pink crystals. Dolomite is a double carbonate, having an alternating structural arrangement of calcium and magnesium ions. Unless it is in fine powder form, it does not rapidly dissolve or effervesce (fizz) in cold dilute hydrochloric acid as calcite does. Crystal twinning is common.

Solid solution exists between dolomite, the iron-dominant ankerite and the manganese-dominant kutnohorite. Small amounts of iron in the structure give the crystals a yellow to brown tint. Manganese substitutes in the structure also up to about three percent MnO. A high manganese content gives the crystals a rosy pink color. Lead, zinc, and cobalt also can substitute in the structure for magnesium. The mineral dolomite is closely related to huntite .

Because dolomite can be dissolved by slightly acidic water, areas where dolomite is an abundant rock-forming mineral are important as aquifers and contribute to karst terrain formation.

==Formation==
Modern dolomite formation has been found to occur under anaerobic conditions in supersaturated saline lagoons such as those at the Rio de Janeiro coast of Brazil, namely, Lagoa Vermelha and Brejo do Espinho. There are many other localities where modern dolomite forms, notably along sabkhas in the Persian Gulf, but also in sedimentary basins bearing gas hydrates and hypersaline lakes. It is often thought that dolomite nucleates with the help of sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g. &quot;Desulfovibrio brasiliensis&quot;), but other microbial metabolisms have been also found to mediate in dolomite formation. In general, low-temperature dolomite may occur in natural supersaturated environments rich in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and microbial cell surfaces. This is likely result from complexation of both magnesium and calcium by carboxylic acids comprising EPS.

Vast deposits of dolomite are present in the geological record, but the mineral is relatively rare in modern environments. Reproducible, inorganic low-temperature syntheses of dolomite are yet to be performed. Usually, the initial inorganic precipitation of a metastable &quot;precursor&quot; (such as magnesium calcite) can easily be achieved. The precursor phase will theoretically change gradually into a more stable phase (such as partially ordered dolomite) during periodical intervals of dissolution and re-precipitation. The general principle governing the course of this irreversible geochemical reaction has been coined &quot;breaking Ostwald&#x27;s step rule&quot;. High diagenetic temperatures, such as those of groundwater flowing along deeply rooted fault systems affecting some sedimentary successions or deeply buried limestone rocks allocate dolomitization. But the mineral is also volumetrically important in some Neogene platforms never subjected to elevated temperatures. Under such conditions of diagenesis the long-term activity of the deep biosphere could play a key role in dolomitization, since diagenetic fluids of contrasting composition are mixed as a response to Milankovitch cycles.

A recent biotic synthetic experiment claims to have precipitated ordered dolomite when anoxygenic photosynthesis proceeds in the presence of manganese(II). A still perplexing example of an organogenic origin is that of the reported formation of dolomite in the urinary bladder of a Dalmatian dog, possibly as the result of an illness or infection.

==Uses==
Dolomite is used as an ornamental stone, a concrete aggregate, and a source of magnesium oxide, as well as in the Pidgeon process for the production of magnesium. It is an important petroleum reservoir rock, and serves as the host rock for large strata-bound Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) ore deposits of base metals such as lead, zinc, and copper. Where calcite limestone is uncommon or too costly, dolomite is sometimes used in its place as a flux for the smelting of iron and steel. Large quantities of processed dolomite are used in the production of float glass.

In horticulture, dolomite and dolomitic limestone are added to soils and soilless potting mixes as a pH buffer and as a magnesium source. Pastures can be limed with dolomitic lime to raise their pH and where there is a magnesium deficiency. 

Dolomite is also used as the substrate in marine (saltwater) aquariums to help buffer changes in the pH of the water.

Calcined dolomite is also used as a catalyst for destruction of tar in the gasification of biomass at high temperature. Particle physics researchers like to build particle detectors under layers of dolomite to enable the detectors to detect the highest possible number of exotic particles. Because dolomite contains relatively minor quantities of radioactive materials, it can insulate against interference from cosmic rays without adding to background radiation levels.

In addition to being an industrial mineral, dolomite is highly valued by collectors and museums when it forms large, transparent crystals. The specimens that appear in the magnesite quarry exploited in Eugui, Esteribar, Navarra (Spain) are considered among the best in the world.

<doc id="102535" wikidata="Q1361427" url="?curid=102535" title="Sexual roleplay">
<text>Sexual roleplay is roleplay that has a strong erotic element. It may involve two or more people who act out roles in order to bring to life a sexual fantasy and may be a form of foreplay and be sexually arousing. Many people regard sexual roleplay as a means of overcoming sexual inhibitions. It may take place in the real world, or via an internet forum, chat-room, video-game, or email—allowing for physically or virtually impossible erotic interests to be enacted.

How seriously the play is taken depends on the participants, and the scenario may be anywhere from simple and makeshift to detailed and elaborate, including costumes and a script. The role-play may involve a fantasy based on any social role and could incorporate any kind of sexual fetish desired by the participants. Examples include items of clothing experienced as erotic or one or more participants being nude. The role-play may involve elements of dominance and submission including sexual bondage and erotic humiliation.

Depending on the play scenario, the roleplay may be before spectators, and bystanders may be unknowing participants in a roleplay. For example, the roleplay may involve house guests or may be taken out of a couple&#x27;s home and into, say, a bar, street, park etc. A role may require, for example, one or both partners to flirt with a stranger, or for one partner to seduce the other partner&#x27;s friend, etc. It may also call for one or both partners to, say, strip in a car or park.

The popularity of the Internet has also allowed for online sexual encounters, known as cybersex, which may involve roleplay. In a 2015 US survey, up to 22% of respondents stated that they had performed sexual role play in their lifetime.

== BDSM ==
Many of the most common sexual roleplays involve a power differential and form part of the dominance and submission aspect of BDSM. Roles can be general designations of power positions, or very specific, detailed fantasies. Some people, such as those living the Gorean lifestyle make use of an entire imaginary world. The controlling player is often called the top or &quot;dominant&quot; while the controlled individual is called the bottom or &quot;submissive&quot;. It can be considered dangerous and therefore a safeword is advised to continue the safety of other(s) in such acts.

== Examples of scenarios ==

Common scenarios include:
*Burglary
*Doctor/Nurse/Patient: medical fetishism where the participants play the roles of doctor, nurse, or patient, e.g., enema play.
*Escort – Client: one partner assumes the role of paid escort for an encounter.
*Ticket Collector - Stoyaway Beauty: one woman dresses in an office skirt outfit with lingerie undergarments with the intent of flirting her way out of paying an expensive train ticket. But the ticket collector, a man, pressures her to pay with sex when she claims she has no money.

*Executive – Secretary: one partner assumes the role of a business executive while the other takes the role of their secretary.
*Handyman – Housewife: the tradesman enters the housewife&#x27;s home initially with the intent of carrying out plumbing/maintenance work.
*Master – Slave: the slave is required to comply with all demands of the master.
*Photographer – Model: this allows one partner to photograph the other as a precursor to sexual interaction.
*Stripper – Client: one participant performs a striptease for the other.
*Teacher – Student: the student dresses for the part and must do as they are told, or are punished.
*Circus master - Lion: the lion is given a demand and must do it for the sake of entertainment.
*Sex doll - Doll owner: the sex doll must stay still and be obedient.
*Pilot – flight attendant: One partner takes on the role of the pilot while the other plays a seductive flight attendant. 
*Mechanic – client: While one partner plays the mechanic the other takes on the role of the client. The client tries to pay the mechanic via seduction. 
*Soldier – girlfriend: A returning soldier is surprised by his girlfriend in a stunning lingerie set.

Other scenarios include:
*Ageplay: where an individual acts and/or treats another as if they were a different age. The practice can be regressive, in which the goal is to re-experience childhood, or sexual, recreating a sexual relationship with people of the pretended ages. Generally this can involve someone pretending to be younger than they actually are, but more rarely can involve assuming an older role.
*Animal roleplay: where a player is treated as a non-human animal such as a dog, pony, or cat.
*Authority figure/Misbehaving Adult: where a player takes on the role of an authority figure and blackmails or humiliates his or her partner into sexual activity.
*Clown kink in the manner of coulrophilia between a young person and a performing mime, jester, or circus clown
*Gender-play: where one or more players take on roles of another gender.
*Incest fantasy: also known as incest play, where two or more play the role of family members.
*Owner/Inanimate object: such as the bottom being human furniture.
*Prison fetish: situational play set in a prison environment. Given real life prisons are same-sex communities, this fetish does lend itself to male on male or female on female activities and settings. Opposite gender play is also possible between inmates and guards or when the setting includes a co-ed facility/institution. Prison play is also an expansion of the uniform fetish by use of inmate, guard, and staff uniforms.
*Torturer/Captive prisoner: where one player is a captor who abuses the other, can also include ravishment and kidnap scenarios.
*Uniform fetishism: one participant dresses in uniform (for instance as a school student, cheerleader, French maid, etc.), while the other participant plays an authority figure (e.g., a parent, teacher, coach, police officer). Can also include scenarios with both participants in uniforms.
*Supernatural Seductions: One participant takes the role of a predatory vampire, incubus, succubus or witch and seduces, enthralls or claims the other participant as their victim.
*Rape play involves acting out roles of coercive sex with communication, consent and safety being especially crucial elements.

Sexologist Gloria Brame lists a number of these scenarios, as does Trevor Jacques.

<text>Daniel Irvin Rather Jr. (; born October 31, 1931) is an American journalist, commentator, and former national evening news anchor. He began his career in Texas, becoming a national name after his reporting saved thousands of lives during Hurricane Carla in September 1961. In his first national broadcast, he helped initiate the successful evacuation of 350,000 people. He reported on some of the most significant events of the modern age, such as the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Gulf War, 9/11, the Iraq War, and the war on terror.

Rather also famously reported from Dallas in November 1963 at the time that President John F. Kennedy had been assassinated. Based on such reporting, he was promoted at CBS News, where he served as White House correspondent beginning in 1964. He served as foreign correspondent in London and Vietnam over the next two years before returning to the White House correspondent position. He covered the presidency of Richard Nixon, including Nixon&#x27;s trip to China, the Watergate scandal, and the president&#x27;s resignation.

In 1981, Rather was promoted to news anchor for the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, a role he occupied for 24 years. Along with Peter Jennings at ABC News and Tom Brokaw at NBC News, he was one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; nightly news anchors in the U.S. from the 1980s through the early 2000s. He frequently contributed to CBS&#x27;s weekly news magazine, &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

Rather left the anchor desk in 2005 following the Killian documents controversy, in which he presented unauthenticated documents in a news report on President George W. Bush&#x27;s Vietnam War–era service in the National Guard. He continued to work with CBS until 2006, when he was dismissed.

In September 2007, Rather filed a $70 million lawsuit against CBS and its former parent company Viacom. Rather accused the network and its ownership and management of making him a &quot;scapegoat&quot; in the Killian story. An intermediate New York state appeals court dismissed the lawsuit in September 2009, and the New York Court of Appeals refused to reinstate it in January 2010.

On the cable channel AXS TV (then called HDNet), Rather hosted &quot;Dan Rather Reports&quot;, a &quot;60 Minutes&quot;–style investigative news program, from 2006 to 2013. He also hosts several other projects for AXS TV, including &quot;Dan Rather Presents&quot;, which provides in-depth reporting on broad topics such as mental health care or adoption, and &quot;The Big Interview with Dan Rather&quot;, in which he conducts long-form interviews with musicians and other entertainers. In January 2018, he began hosting an online newscast called &quot;The News with Dan Rather&quot; on the &quot;Young Turks&quot; YouTube channel. Since 2021, he has been writing the newsletter &quot;Steady&quot; on the Substack platform, with 170 posts in 2024.

In April 2024, Rather was interviewed by correspondent Lee Cowan on &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, his first return to CBS News since his 2006 departure.

== Early life ==

Rather was born on October 31, 1931, in Wharton County, Texas, the son of Daniel Irvin Rather Sr., a ditch digger and pipe layer, and the former Byrl Veda Page. Neither of his parents completed high school; however, they were avid readers. The Rathers moved to Houston when he was a child, where Dan attended Lovett Elementary School and Hamilton Middle School. He graduated in 1950 from John H. Reagan High School in Houston where he played football. Rather aspired to be a reporter, and his mother encouraged him to attend college and to become the first person in the family to earn a college degree. He hitchhiked to Sam Houston State Teachers College in Huntsville, Texas and walked on to the school&#x27;s football team. 

When he did not earn an athletic scholarship, Rather turned his focus to journalism and found part-time jobs to pay for tuition. In 1953, Rather earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism, and he was editor of the school newspaper, &quot;The Houstonian&quot;. He was also a member of the Caballeros, the founding organization of the Epsilon Psi chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity. While in college, Rather worked for KSAM-FM radio in Huntsville, calling junior high, high school, and Sam Houston State football games. After obtaining his undergraduate degree, Rather briefly attended South Texas College of Law in Houston.

In January 1954, Rather enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and was sent to Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego. He was soon discharged, however, because he was found to have had rheumatic fever as a child, a fact he had omitted during the enlistment process.

== Early career ==

Rather began his journalism career in 1950 as an Associated Press reporter in Huntsville, Texas. Later, he was a reporter for United Press (1950–1952), several Texas radio stations, and the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; (1954–1955). Around 1955, Rather wrote a piece on heroin. Under the auspices of the Houston Police, he tried a dose of the drug, which he characterized as &quot;a special kind of hell&quot;.

He worked for four seasons as the play-by-play announcer for the University of Houston football team. During the 1959 minor league baseball season, Rather was the play-by-play radio announcer for the Texas League Houston Buffs.

In 1959, Rather began his television career as part of a weekly Coaches Show for the University of Houston on KTRK-TV, the ABC affiliate in Houston. In 1960, he was hired as the 6:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. news anchor and director of news for KHOU-TV, the local CBS affiliate.

In September 1961, Rather covered Hurricane Carla for KHOU-TV, broadcasting from the then National Weather Center in Galveston and showing the first radar image of a hurricane on TV. He conceived of overlaying a transparent map over the radar screen, to show the size of Hurricane Carla to the audience. Convinced of the threat, more than 350,000 people evacuated from the area, the largest known evacuation to that time. Their actions are believed to have saved thousands of lives compared to the previous hurricane, which had killed 6,000 to 12,000 people. Rather&#x27;s live coverage of Carla was broadcast by New York and national stations. Ray Miller, news director of KPRC-TV, the NBC affiliate in Houston, also mentored Rather in his early years.

On February 28, 1962, Rather left Houston for New York City for a six-month trial initiation at CBS. Rather did not fit in easily on the East Coast. His first report for CBS included radio coverage of the crash of American Airlines Flight 1 in Jamaica Bay, and a story on the accidental deaths of newborns who were served salt in their formula at Binghamton General Hospital in Binghamton, New York, referred to years later as the Salt Babies. Shortly after, Rather was made chief of CBS&#x27;s Southwest bureau in Dallas. In August 1963, he was appointed chief of the Southern bureau in New Orleans, responsible for coverage of news events in the South, Southwest, Mexico and Central America.

=== JFK assassination to Watergate ===
In his autobiography, Rather noted that he was in Dallas in November 1963 to return film from an interview in Uvalde at the ranch of former Vice President John Nance Garner, who celebrated his 95th birthday on November 22. He happened to be &quot;on the other side of the railroad tracks, beyond the triple underpass, thirty yards from a grassy knoll that would later figure in so many conspiracy theories&quot;. His job was to fetch a film drop from a camera truck at that location, and take it to the station for editing. He did not witness the shooting of Kennedy, and knew nothing of the events until he reached KRLD, having run through Dealey Plaza. He later wrote: 
The moment I cleared the railroad tracks I saw a scene I will never forget. Some people were lying on the grass, some screaming, some running, some pointing. Policemen swarmed everywhere and distinctly above the din, I heard one shout, &#x27;DON&#x27;T ANYBODY PANIC.&#x27; And of course, there was nothing but panic wherever you looked.

In his autobiography, Rather said he was one of the first to view the Zapruder film showing the assassination, and the first to describe it on television. Rather reported the fatal headshot as forcing Kennedy&#x27;s head forward, but it was thrown backward.

Later, he reported that some Dallas schoolchildren had applauded when they were notified of the president&#x27;s death. Administrators said they had announced that school was to be dismissed early, and did not mention the assassination. However, teacher Joanna Morgan confirmed that students had cheered at the news that Kennedy was shot. This story infuriated local journalists at then-CBS affiliate KRLD-TV (now Fox-owned-and-operated KDFW-TV).

Rather&#x27;s reporting during the national mourning period following the Kennedy assassination and subsequent events impressed CBS News management. In 1964, they selected him for the network&#x27;s White House correspondent position. When White House correspondent, he contributed to the subsequent events following the Kennedy assassination. In 1965, he contributed to the reporting of return to Washington from Dallas by Charles von Fremd during a conversation that NBC Director Max Schindler, who directed the coverage of the arrival for the networks, did with President Lyndon B. Johnson, at the White House for the TV networks.

In 1965, Rather served as a foreign correspondent for CBS in London, and in 1966 in Vietnam. He served again as White House correspondent during the presidency of Richard Nixon. In 1970, he was also assigned as anchor for the CBS Sunday Night News (1970–73; 1974–75), and later for the CBS Saturday &quot;Evening News&quot; (1973–76). Rather was among those journalists who accompanied Nixon to China. He later covered the Watergate investigation, as well as the impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon in Congress.

=== &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; anchor ===

After President Nixon&#x27;s resignation in 1974, Rather became chief correspondent for the documentary series &quot;CBS Reports&quot;. In December 1975, he became a correspondent of the long-running Sunday night news show &quot;60 Minutes—&quot;at the time the program was moved from a Sunday afternoon time-slot to primetime. Success there helped Rather pull ahead of longtime correspondent Roger Mudd, who was in line to succeed Walter Cronkite as anchor and Managing Editor of &quot;The&quot; &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;.

Rather succeeded to the news anchor position after Cronkite&#x27;s retirement, making his first broadcast on March 9, 1981. Rather had a significantly different style of reporting the news. In contrast to the Cronkite, who ended his newscast with &quot;That&#x27;s the way it is,&quot; Rather searched to find a broadcast ending more suitable to his tastes. For one week in September 1986, with CBS the target of potentially hostile new ownership, Rather tried ending his broadcasts with the word &quot;courage&quot;, and was roundly ridiculed for it. For nearly two decades, Rather ended the show with: &quot;That&#x27;s part of our world tonight.&quot;

Rather also held other positions during his time as anchor. In January 1988, he became host of the newly created &quot;48 Hours,&quot; and in January 1999, Rather joined the new &quot;60 Minutes II&quot; as a correspondent.

Ratings for the &quot;Evening News&quot; with Rather at the helm fluctuated wildly, at a time when more alternatives to TV news were developing. After a dip to second place, Rather regained the top spot in 1985 until 1989, when he ceded the ratings peak to rival Peter Jennings at &quot;ABC&#x27;s World News Tonight&quot;. By 1992, however, the &quot;Evening News&quot; had fallen to third place of the three major networks. It rose in rankings in 2005, when Bob Schieffer became the interim anchor between Rather and Katie Couric. It briefly moved ahead of &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; in the wake of the death of Peter Jennings, but remained behind &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. Rather was a frequent collaborator with CBS News producer Susan Zirinsky, a leading member of the news division&#x27;s staff.

In 1987, new CBS owner Laurence Tisch oversaw layoffs of hundreds of CBS News employees, in a major shake-up of the network. Among those to go were correspondents such as David Andelman, Fred Graham, Morton Dean, and Ike Pappas. Fewer videotape crews were dispatched to cover stories, and numerous bureaus were closed. Critics cited the cutbacks as a major factor in CBS News&#x27; fall into third place in the ratings.
For a short time from 1993 to 1995, Rather co-anchored the evening news with Connie Chung. Chung had been a Washington, DC correspondent for CBS News, and anchored short news updates on the West Coast during her time as a newscaster for KNXT (now KCBS-TV) in Los Angeles. On joining the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, she reported &quot;pop news&quot; stories. In one widely cited case, she aggressively pursued Tonya Harding, who was accused of a plot to injure fellow Olympic ice skater Nancy Kerrigan. After Chung left the network, Rather went back to doing the newscast alone.
By the 2005–06 season, the end of Rather&#x27;s time as anchor, &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; lagged behind &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; in the ratings. But it still drew approximately 5.5 million viewers a night. Criticism of Rather reached a fever pitch after &quot;60 Minutes II&quot; ran his 2004 report about President Bush&#x27;s military record. Numerous critics questioned the authenticity of the documents upon which the report was based. Rather subsequently admitted on the air that the documents&#x27; authenticity could not be proven. In the aftermath, CBS fired several members of CBS News staff but temporarily retained Rather, until his contract was up for renewal the following year, whereupon he was completely ousted.

== Journalistic history and influence ==

=== Nixon ===
During Richard Nixon&#x27;s presidency, critics accused Rather of biased coverage against him. At a Houston news conference in March 1974, Nixon fielded a question from Rather, still CBS&#x27;s White House correspondent, who said, &quot;Thank you, Mr. President. Dan Rather, of CBS News.&quot; The room filled with jeers and applause, prompting Nixon to joke, &quot;Are you running for something?&quot; Rather replied, &quot;No, sir, Mr. President. Are you?&quot; He questioned whether Nixon was cooperating with the grand jury investigation and House Judiciary Committee in relation to the Watergate scandal.

NBC&#x27;s Tom Brokaw has said the network considered hiring him to replace Rather as its White House correspondent, but dropped it after word was leaked to the press. Rather was believed to have provided tough coverage of the Watergate scandal, raising his profile.

=== Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster ===

In January 1986, NASA faced repeated delays in the preparations to launch the Space Shuttles &quot;Columbia&quot; and &quot;Challenger&quot; in close sequence. Rather described the January 10 delay of &quot;Columbia&quot; as: 
star-crossed space shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; stood ready for launch again today, and once more, the launch was scrubbed. Heavy rain was the cause this time. The launch has been postponed so often since its original date, December 18, that it&#x27;s now known as mission impossible.
This was considered an example of the &quot;biting sarcasm&quot; the media used related to NASA&#x27;s scheduling. &quot;Columbia&quot; launched on January 12.

On January 27, Rather&#x27;s reporting of the expected &quot;Challenger&quot; launch began as follows:
On January 28, &quot;Challenger&quot;&#x27;s explosion and destruction occurred 73 seconds after launch.

=== Afghanistan, Reagan, and George H. W. Bush ===

During the Soviet–Afghan War, Rather was filmed reporting near the front lines while wearing a traditional mujahideen headdress and garments. Rather attracted an &quot;Evening News&quot; audience (and was nicknamed &quot;Gunga Dan&quot;). The American comic strip &quot;Doonesbury&quot; spoofed his actions.

Rather&#x27;s reports were later revealed to have influenced Congressman Charlie Wilson (D-Texas), who led an effort to help the mujahideen which included the Taliban. The Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan in the late 1980s, shortly before the collapse of the USSR.

Rather was promoted to the anchor spot on the &quot;Evening News&quot;. He was competing with Roger Mudd, a more senior correspondent and a frequent substitute anchor for Walter Cronkite on &quot;Evening News&quot;. Mudd had also anchored the Sunday evening broadcast, but Rather traveled through Afghanistan when news led there. A few years into his service as anchor, Rather began wearing sweaters beneath his suit jacket to soften his on-air appearance for viewers.

During the 1980s, Rather gained further renown for his forceful and direct reporting of the Iran–Contra affair. He questioned Vice President George H. W. Bush in an on-air interview during the latter&#x27;s presidential campaign. Bush referred to Rather&#x27;s &quot;dead air incident&quot; saying: 
I want to talk about why I want to be President, why those 41 percent of the people are supporting me. And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran. How would you like it if I judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the set in New York?

Shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait, Rather secured an interview with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
On February 24, 2003, Rather conducted another interview with Hussein before the United States&#x27; 2003 invasion of Iraq. In the interview, Hussein invited Rather to be the moderator of a live television debate between himself and George W. Bush. The debate never took place.

=== &quot;The Wall Within&quot; ===
On June 2, 1988, Rather hosted a CBS News special, &quot;The Wall Within&quot;. In it, he interviewed six veterans, each of whom said he had witnessed horrible acts in Vietnam. Two of the men said that they had killed civilians, and two others said that they had seen friends die. Each talked about the effects the war had upon their lives—including depression, unemployment, drug use, and homelessness.

In 2004, &quot;National Review&quot; ran an article by Anne Morse entitled &quot;The First Rathergate&quot;. She said that almost nothing claimed by participants in &quot;The Wall Within&quot; was true. Citing the self-published book &quot;Stolen Valor&quot; (1998) by veteran B. G. Burkett, and investigative journalist Glenna Whitley, Morse said that military records revealed that the six former servicemen had lied about their experiences. Only one served in combat, and two had never been in Vietnam.

=== Killian documents ===

On September 8, 2004, Rather reported on &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot; that a series of memos critical of President George W. Bush&#x27;s Texas Air National Guard service record had been discovered in the personal files of Lt. Bush&#x27;s former commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian. Once copies of the documents were made available on the Internet, their authenticity was quickly called into question. Much of this was based on the fact that the documents were proportionally printed and displayed using other modern typographic conventions usually unavailable on military typewriters of the 1970s. The font used on the documents has characteristics that exactly or almost exactly match standard font features of Microsoft Word. This led to claims that the memos were forgeries. The accusations then spread over the following days into mainstream media outlets, including &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot;.

Rather and CBS initially defended the story, insisting that the documents had been authenticated by experts. CBS was contradicted by some of the experts it originally cited, and later reported that its source for the documents—former Texas Army National Guard officer Lt. Col. Bill Burkett—had misled the network about how he had obtained them.

On September 20, 2004, CBS retracted the story. Rather stated, &quot;If I knew then what I know now, I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question.&quot; The controversy has been referred to by some as &quot;Memogate&quot; and &quot;Rathergate&quot;.

Following an investigation commissioned by CBS, CBS fired story producer Mary Mapes, and asked three other producers connected with the story to resign. Many believe Rather&#x27;s retirement was hastened by this incident. On September 20, 2007, Rather was interviewed on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; commenting, &quot;Nobody has proved that they were fraudulent, much less a forgery. ... The truth of this story stands up to this day.&quot;

=== Departure from the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; ===
Rather retired as the anchorman and Managing Editor of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; in 2005; his last broadcast was Wednesday, March 9, 2005. He had worked as the anchorman for 24 full years, the longest tenure of anyone in American television history, and for a short time, continued to work as a correspondent for &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. Bob Schieffer, a fellow Texan and host of &quot;Face the Nation,&quot; took over Rather&#x27;s position on an interim basis, with Katie Couric replacing Schieffer in 2006.
Since retiring, Rather has spoken out about what he perceives as a lack of courage by American journalists. On January 24, 2006, Rather spoke to a Seattle audience. Before the speaking engagement, he told a newspaper reporter, &quot;In many ways on many days, [reporters] have sort of adopted the attitude of &#x27;go along, get along.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;What many of us need is a spine transplant,&quot; Rather added. &quot;Whether it&#x27;s City Hall, the State House, or the White House, part of our job is to speak truth to power.&quot;

=== Fired from CBS News ===
In June 2006, reports surfaced that CBS News would most likely not renew Rather&#x27;s contract. According to a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article, sources from CBS said that executives at the network decided &quot;there is no future role for Rather&quot;.

On June 20, 2006, CBS News and Sports President Sean McManus announced that Rather would leave the network after 44 years. Rather issued a separate statement which accompanied the news of the departure:

==== Lawsuit over ouster from CBS Network ====
On September 19, 2007, Rather filed a $70 million lawsuit in the New York Supreme Court before judge Ira Gammerman, against CBS, its former parent company Viacom; CBS President and CEO Leslie Moonves; Sumner Redstone, chairman of both Viacom and CBS; and Andrew Heyward, former president of CBS News. Rather accused the network and its ownership and management of making him a &quot;scapegoat&quot; in the Killian story. A CBS spokesman claimed that the lawsuit was &quot;old news&quot; and &quot;without merit&quot;. On September 21, 2009, Rather&#x27;s lawyers claimed that Bush&#x27;s military service would be proven to be a sham, and Rather would be vindicated. On September 29, 2009, a New York state appeals court dismissed Rather&#x27;s lawsuit against CBS. On January 12, 2010, New York&#x27;s top court refused to reinstate Rather&#x27;s breach-of-contract lawsuit against CBS Corp. In his book titled &quot;Rather Outspoken,&quot; Rather claimed that the lawsuit &quot;took a big whack out of my time, my psyche and my bank balance, but even so, it was worth it&quot;. On May 18, 2012, Rather appeared on &quot;Real Time With Bill Maher&quot; and claimed he had been fired for reporting a story about George W. Bush&#x27;s year of absence from the reserve unit he served with, and that the news corporations had been &quot;very uncomfortable&quot; running the story.

== Post-CBS career ==
Following his departure from CBS, Rather joined Mark Cuban&#x27;s cable network AXS TV (then called HDNet) to host and produce the weekly one-hour news show &quot;Dan Rather Reports&quot; from 2006 until 2013.

Since 2013, Rather has hosted and produced the hour-long series &quot;The Big Interview with Dan Rather&quot; on AXS TV, where he sits down for in-depth interviews with influential figures in music and entertainment, such as: Gregory Allman, Robert Plant, John Fogerty, Quentin Tarantino, Simon Cowell, Aaron Sorkin, and Sammy Hagar. He has also produced several documentary specials for the network under the banner &quot;Dan Rather Presents,&quot; including specials about &quot;America&#x27;s Mental Health Crisis&quot;, the United States Secret Service, and &quot;The Shameful Side of International Adoption&quot;.

Rather also appears frequently on a number of news shows, including MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot; and &quot;The Last Word with Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell&quot; and on CNN. He has also written for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; and Mashable.

On May 28, 2007, Rather compared historical events to events in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films in the History Channel special titled &quot;Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed&quot;.

In 2012, Rather published an autobiography titled &quot;Rather Outspoken: My Life in the News&quot;.

In 2015, Rather launched an independent production company called News and Guts Media, through which he produces &quot;The Big Interview&quot; among other projects.

In 2015, Rather also began actively posting on Facebook. He credits young staffers at News and Guts Media with pushing him to try social media. While his posts were considerably longer than typical social media posts, they resonated with the audience, which soon grew to more than two million followers. Even late night TV noticed Rather&#x27;s unusual but effective Facebook presence. Subject matter has covered a range of topics, including: current political events, journalism, and childhood memories.

On September 23, 2016, SiriusXM Radio announced a new hour-long weekly program, &quot;Dan Rather&#x27;s America&quot;, airing Tuesday mornings at 10am Eastern on Radio Andy channel 102, debuting on September 27.

In the fall of 2017, the Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas completed a digital humanities project dedicated to the long career of the journalist that was titled &quot;Dan Rather: American Journalist&quot;. The culmination of three years of research conducted at the Briscoe Center, the site uses materials from a dozen archives and libraries, and draws from over 25 of the Briscoe Center for American History&#x27;s news media and photojournalism collections. The website features over 2,000 digitized documents, 300 excerpts from twelve oral history interviews, and 1000 video clips, enabling visitors to dive deep into the history of the last 60 years through the lens of Dan Rather&#x27;s career.

On January 21, 2018, it was announced that Rather would be launching a weekly 30-minute newscast on &quot;The Young Turks&quot;. Titled &quot;The News with Dan Rather&quot;, it aired on Mondays at 5:30pm Eastern Time until that June.

== Personal life ==
Rather was married to Jean Goebel for 67 years, from 1957 until her death in November 2024. They had a son and daughter, and maintained homes in New York City and Austin, Texas. Their daughter Robin is an environmentalist and community activist in Austin. Their son Dan is an assistant D.A. in the Manhattan, New York City, District Attorney&#x27;s office.

Sam Houston State University renamed its mass communications building after Rather in 1994. The building houses &quot;The Houstonian&quot; and KSHU, the student-run radio and television stations. In May 2007, Rather received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Siena College in Loudonville, New York, for his lifetime contributions to journalism.

A columnist whose work is distributed by King Features Syndicate, Rather continues to speak out against political influence in journalism by corporations and governments. At a 2008 conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota, sponsored by the group Free Press, Rather criticized both local and national news organizations, stating—according to reports—that there is no longer incentive to do &quot;good and valuable news&quot;.

== Awards ==

Rather has received numerous Emmy Awards, several Peabody Awards, and various honorary degrees from universities.

In addition to these awards, Rather was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 2004. In 2001, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2023, Rather was inducted into the SXSW Hall of Fame.

== Criticism ==
As one of the last broadcast news journalists from the era of the &quot;Big Three&quot; network news primacy, Rather was generally regarded highly within his profession by long-serving journalists; however, he has been accused of having a liberal bias.

=== Claims of bias ===
Rather&#x27;s on-screen comments and election-night reporting have come under attack dating back to Richard Nixon&#x27;s presidency. In a June 2002 interview with Larry King, his long-time co-worker (and self-described liberal), Andy Rooney stated that Rather is &quot;transparently liberal&quot;.

During the weeks following the Killian documents stories, Rather received widespread criticism from other journalists and historians. In an interview with commentator Bill Maher, Rather accused Fox News Channel of receiving &quot;talking points&quot; from the Republican-controlled White House. Fox News commentator Bill O&#x27;Reilly, who had defended Rather during the Killian documents incident, criticized Rather for not offering any evidence to support the claim.

In 2002, Bernard Goldberg published a book with the title &quot;&quot;, alleging a liberal bias in print and broadcast news organizations. In the book, Goldberg used Dan Rather as a primary example of a news anchorman with a liberal bias. He also criticized the anchor for his criticisms of President George W. Bush&#x27;s and Vice President Dan Quayle&#x27;s service in the National Guard, rather than the Active Duty military during the Vietnam War, and questioned Rather&#x27;s own service.

Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting has accused Rather of having &quot;an unwillingness to challenge official power and policy&quot; in his reporting. Investigative reporter Mark Hertsgaard characterized Rather as a &quot;stern anti-Communist&quot; during the Reagan administration, for allegedly having &quot;reported the pronouncements of public officials with considerable respect&quot;.

In April 2001, according to a front-page story in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Rather spoke at a Democratic party fundraiser in Austin, where he was the featured speaker. One of the official hosts for the fundraiser was Rather&#x27;s daughter, Robin Rather; Rather said that he did not realize that his daughter was a host of the fundraiser. Rather also said that he did not realize that the event was a partisan fundraiser, although he did realize that after he arrived at the event.

=== From Walter Cronkite ===
During an appearance on CNN&#x27;s &quot;American Morning&quot; in 2005, former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite said about Rather: &quot;It surprised quite a few people at CBS and elsewhere that, without being able to pull up the ratings beyond third in a three-man field, that they tolerated his being there for so long.&quot; Cronkite also said that he would like to have seen Bob Schieffer in Rather&#x27;s position sooner.

=== From Dallas CBS news director Eddie Barker ===
In the aftermath of the Kennedy assassination while Rather was a Dallas reporter, he interviewed a minister, who said some local schoolchildren had cheered upon learning of the President&#x27;s shooting. The Associated Press later confirmed the story. A teacher at the school backed up the Rather story, confirming that some students at the school had cheered at the principal&#x27;s news about Kennedy. Eddie Barker, local Dallas-area news director for CBS, claimed that the children were merely happy about being sent home early, and he also claimed that they had not been given a reason for early school closure (Barker&#x27;s children attended the school). Barker alleged that Rather had deliberately misrepresented the facts by indicating that the children were happy about the shooting. Barker attempted to fire Rather, but was overruled by the national CBS News management.

== Incidents and controversies ==

=== 1968 Democratic convention ===
During live coverage of the 1968 Democratic National Convention, Rather attempted to interview a delegate from Georgia who appeared as though he was being forcibly removed by men without identification badges.

As Rather approached the delegate to question the apparent strong-arm tactics of the Chicago political machine under Mayor Daley, he was punched in the stomach by one of the men, knocking him to the ground. &quot;He lifted me right off the floor and put me away. I was down, the breath knocked out of me, as the whole group blew on by me ... In the CBS control room, they had switched the camera onto me just as I was slugged.&quot; Walter Cronkite, viewing the incident, added on-air, &quot;I think we got a bunch of thugs here Dan!&quot;

=== Chicago cab ride ===
On November 10, 1980, Rather landed at Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport and got into a cab. He asked the cab driver to take him to the home of writer Studs Terkel, whom he was interviewing for &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. A police spokesman said that the cab driver refused to go to the address and instead &quot;wildly drove through the city streets,&quot; with Rather shouting out the window asking for help. The driver was charged with disorderly conduct. Rather called the incident &quot;a rather minor thing&quot;. By the time the case was about to come to trial, he was about to add anchoring the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; to his &quot;60 Minutes&quot; role at CBS News. Rather declined to press charges, citing a &quot;mounting schedule of reporting assignments&quot;.

=== Galloway lawsuit ===
In 1980, Rather and CBS were taken to court when Carl Galloway, a California doctor, claimed that a report on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; wrongfully implicated him in an insurance fraud scheme. CBS stated Galloway had signed the bogus report and was suing Rather because he was upset at being caught. The jury sided with CBS and Rather, and they won the case. During the trial, Galloway&#x27;s side used outtakes from the TV report showing that one interview was rehearsed.

=== &quot;Courage&quot; ===
For one week in September 1986, Rather signed off his broadcasts to CBS with the word &quot;courage&quot;. He said that it was just a signature line, and had nothing to do with the news at the time. Other newscasters ridiculed and parodied Rather, and he dropped it.

=== &quot;Kenneth, what is the frequency?&quot; ===

On October 4, 1986, while walking along Park Avenue to his New York apartment, Rather was attacked and punched from behind by a man who demanded to know &quot;Kenneth, what is the frequency?&quot; while a second assailant chased and beat him. As the assailant pummeled and kicked Rather, he kept repeating the question. In describing the incident, Rather said &quot;I got mugged. Who understands these things? I didn&#x27;t and I don&#x27;t now. I didn&#x27;t make a lot of it at the time and I don&#x27;t now. I wish I knew who did it and why, but I have no idea.&quot; Until the crime was resolved years later, Rather&#x27;s description of the bizarre crime led some to doubt the veracity of his account, although the doorman and building supervisor who came to Rather&#x27;s aid fully confirmed his version of events.

The assault remained unsolved for some time, and the phrase &quot;What&#x27;s the frequency, Kenneth?&quot; became a popular culture reference over the years, such as in a scene in the graphic novel &quot;Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron&quot; by Daniel Clowes. The opening track of the 1987 album &quot;Lolita Nation&quot; by California power pop group Game Theory is titled &quot;Kenneth, What&#x27;s the Frequency?&quot; In 1994, the band R.E.M. released the song &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; on their album &quot;Monster&quot;. Rather later sang with R.E.M. during a sound check prior to a gig at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, which was shown the following night on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

In 1997, a TV critic writing in the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; solved the mystery, publishing a photo of the alleged assailant, William Tager, who received a 12.5-to-25-year prison sentence for killing NBC stagehand Campbell Montgomery outside &quot;The Today Show&quot; studio in 1994. Rather confirmed the story: &quot;There&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that this is the person.&quot; New York District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau said &quot;William Tager&#x27;s identity as the man who attacked Mr. Rather was established in the course of an investigation by my office.&quot; Tager claimed he thought television networks were beaming signals into his brain. When he murdered the stagehand, Tager was trying to force his way into an NBC studio with a weapon, to find out the frequency the networks were using to attack him, so that he could block it. Tager was paroled in October 2010.

=== Dead air ===
On September 11, 1987, Pope John Paul II was in Miami, beginning a rare U.S. tour. Rather was scheduled to anchor &quot;Evening News&quot; remotely. A U.S. Open tennis match broadcast ran long, extending into the timeslot for the &quot;Evening News&quot;. Rather walked off the set in anger just before he was to anchor the newscast. He was upset and informed CBS Sports that it should fill the half-hour if the &quot;Evening News&quot; did not begin on time. The Steffi Graf–Lori McNeil tennis coverage ended sooner than expected at 6:32 pm, but Rather had disappeared by then and could not be located. (CBS Sports agreed to break away immediately after the match without commentary.) More than 100 CBS affiliate stations were forced to broadcast six minutes of dead air. Some stations aired syndicated programming, such as reruns of game shows or sitcoms, and others displayed graphics explaining that they were experiencing technical difficulties.

Phil Jones, the chairman of the CBS affiliation board and general manager of Kansas City&#x27;s KCTV, demanded an apology from Rather. Miami CBS affiliate WTVJ dropped the newscast episode entirely and aired a syndicated rerun of a game show instead. The next day, Rather apologized for abandoning the anchor desk.

The following year, when Rather asked Vice President George H.W. Bush about his role in the Iran–Contra affair during a live interview, Bush responded, &quot;Dan, how would you like it if I judged your entire career by those seven minutes when you walked off the set in New York?&quot; Bush&#x27;s media consultant Roger Ailes had a mole at CBS who alerted him that Rather&#x27;s goal was to &quot;take Bush out of the race&quot; with a tough interview about Iran-Contra. Ailes alerted Bush during the cab ride to the studio and suggested the reply. Bush was running for president in 1988, and his polling favorability benefited in Iowa and New Hampshire after the interview aired.

In his 2013 book, Rather denied being angry or upset but only misinformed about the timing of the match.

== &quot;Ratherisms&quot; ==

Rather is known for his many colorful analogies and descriptions during live broadcasts. Similar to those used by baseball announcer Red Barber, cycling commentator Phil Liggett, and Formula 1 commentator Murray Walker, these &quot;Ratherisms&quot; are also called &quot;Texanisms&quot; or &quot;Danisms&quot; by some. A few of the more colorful ones, several of which were used throughout the 2008 HBO made-for-TV movie &quot;Recount&quot; about the 2000 Election, include:
* &quot;This race is shakier than cafeteria Jell-O.&quot;
* &quot;This thing is as tight as the rusted lugnuts on a &#x27;55 Ford.&quot;
* His characterization of the Republican Party&#x27;s assessment of President Obama: &quot;[He] couldn&#x27;t sell watermelons if you gave him the state troopers to flag down the traffic.&quot;

== In popular culture ==

Rather has been referenced in the television shows &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot; and many films. An animated caricature of him made a cameo appearance in the JibJab political cartoon, &quot;Good to Be in D.C.&quot; In 1971, he had a cameo in an episode of the number one hit comedy series &quot;All in the Family&quot;. Entitled &quot;The Man in the Street&quot;, series star Carroll O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Archie Bunker character excitedly awaits the viewing of a videotaped interview he gave earlier that day for the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. At the last minute, to his dismay, the segment is preempted by the telecast of a Richard Nixon presidential address from the Oval Office. Rather appears, as himself, delivering post-speech analysis from actual news footage. Jean Stapleton, as Archie&#x27;s scatterbrained wife Edith Bunker, says of Rather how he&#x27;s there to &quot;...tell us what Mr. Nixon just said.&quot;

In 2004, he was featured in the documentary film &quot;Barbecue: A Texas Love Story&quot; by Austin-based director Chris Elley. Two years later, Rather and Elley educated a group of New Yorkers in Madison Square Park about the true meaning of BBQ, and its significance to the identity of the Lone Star State.

In the 2006–07 graphic novel &quot;Shooting War&quot;, which is set in the year 2011, an 80-year-old Dan Rather is shown to be one of the last journalists still reporting from Iraq. He had a cameo in the premiere of the Fall 2007 drama &quot;Dirty Sexy Money&quot; on ABC television. He guest-starred as himself in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode, &quot;E Pluribus Wiggum&quot;.

Rather appeared on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; in May 2009, wearing an Afro wig and mutton-chop sideburns to narrate a segment about the late former President Nixon eating a burrito, as a parody of MSNBC&#x27;s extensive coverage of President Obama and Vice President Biden&#x27;s hamburger lunch. He appears in the 2008 award-winning documentary &quot;Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story&quot;.

A skit on the 38th season of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; featured Anderson Cooper interviewing two grouches, &quot;Walter Cranky&quot; and &quot;Dan Rather Not&quot;, who, when asked to answer questions, demurred with the phrase &quot;I&#x27;d rather not.&quot;

Robert Redford portrayed Rather in the 2015 film &quot;Truth&quot;. Rather appeared in the documentary series &quot;Facing&quot; in the episode &quot;Facing Saddam&quot;, providing his views on Saddam Hussein.

The 1998 mashup song &quot;Rocked by Rape&quot; by the Evolution Control Committee parodied TV news by selecting hundreds of phrases uttered by Rather on the air, focusing on bad, evil, terrible things. CBS sent them a &quot;cease-and-desist&quot; letter in 2000, claiming copyright violation, but after fair use responses from the Committee and others, desisted. The recording was played at a Rather roast and on C-SPAN.

In 2024, Netflix aired the documentary film &quot;Rather&quot;, directed by Frank Marshall, a biography of Rather.

== Ratings ==
Under Rather&#x27;s predecessor, Walter Cronkite, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; was a strong No. 1 in the ratings, which Rather maintained through much of the 1980s. However, Tom Brokaw and his &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, and Peter Jennings of ABC News&#x27; &quot;World News Tonight&quot;, increasing in popularity, eventually cut deep into the Rather broadcast&#x27;s numbers.

<text>Meiko Scientific Ltd. was a British supercomputer company based in Bristol, founded by members of the design team working on the Inmos transputer microprocessor.

==History==
In 1985, when Inmos management suggested the release of the transputer be delayed, Miles Chesney, David Alden, Eric Barton, Roy Bottomley, James Cownie, and Gerry Talbot resigned and formed Meiko (Japanese for &quot;well-engineered&quot;) to start work on massively parallel machines based on the processor. Nine weeks later in July 1985, they demonstrated a transputer system based on experimental 16-bit transputers at the SIGGRAPH in San Francisco.

In 1986, a system based on 32-bit T414 transputers was launched as the &quot;Meiko Computing Surface&quot;. By 1990, Meiko had sold more than 300 systems and grown to 125 employees. In 1993, Meiko launched the second-generation &quot;Meiko CS-2&quot; system, but the company ran into financial difficulties in the mid-1990s. The technical team and technology was transferred to a joint venture company named Quadrics Supercomputers World Ltd. (QSW), formed by Alenia Spazio of Italy in mid-1996. At Quadrics, the CS-2 interconnect technology was developed into QsNet.

, a vestigial Meiko website still exists.

==Computing Surface==
The Meiko Computing Surface (sometimes retrospectively referred to as the CS-1) was a massively parallel supercomputer. The system was based on the Inmos transputer microprocessor, later also using SPARC and Intel i860 processors.

The Computing Surface architecture comprised multiple boards containing transputers connected together by their communications links via Meiko-designed link switch chips. A variety of different boards were produced with different transputer variants, random-access memory (RAM) capacities and peripherals.

The initial software environments provided for the Computing Surface was &quot;Occam Programming System&quot; (OPS), Meiko&#x27;s version of Inmos&#x27;s D700 Transputer Development System. This was soon superseded by a multi-user version, &quot;MultiOPS&quot;. Later, Meiko introduced &quot;Meiko Multiple Virtual Computing Surfaces&quot; (M²VCS), a multi-user resource management system let the processors of a Computing Surface be partitioned into several &quot;domains&quot; of different sizes. These domains were allocated by M²VCS to individual users, thus allowing several simultaneous users access to their own virtual Computing Surfaces. M²VCS was used in conjunction with either OPS or &quot;MeikOS&quot;, a Unix-like single-processor operating system.

In 1988, Meiko launched the In-Sun Computing Surface, which repackaged the Computing Surface into VMEbus boards (designated the MK200 series) suitable for installation in larger Sun-3 or Sun-4 systems. The Sun acted as &quot;front-end&quot; host system for managing the transputers, running development tools and providing mass storage. A version of M²VCS running as a SunOS daemon named &quot;Sun Virtual Computing Surfaces&quot; (SVCS) provided access between the transputer network and the Sun host.

As the performance of the transputer became less competitive toward the end of the 1980s (the follow-on T9000 transputer being beset with delays), Meiko added the ability to supplement the transputers with Intel i860 processors. Each i860 board (MK086 or MK096) contained two i860s with up to 32 MB of RAM each, and two T800s providing inter-processor communication. Sometimes known as the Concerto or simply the i860 Computing Surface, these systems had limited success.

Meiko also produced a SPARC processor board, the MK083, which allowed the integration of the SunOS operating system into the Computing Surface architecture, similarly to the In-Sun Computing Surface. These were usually used as front-end host processors for transputer or i860 Computing Surfaces. SVCS, or an improved version, called simply &quot;VCS&quot; was used to manage the transputer resources. Computing Surface configurations with multiple MK083 boards were also possible.

A major drawback of the Computing Surface architecture was poor I/O bandwidth for general data shuffling. Although aggregate bandwidth for special case data shuffling could be very high, the general case has very poor performance relative to the compute bandwidth. This made the Meiko Computing Surface uneconomic for many applications.

===MeikOS===

MeikOS (also written as &quot;Meikos&quot; or &quot;MEiKOS&quot;) is a Unix-like transputer operating system developed for the Computing Surface during the late 1980s.

MeikOS was derived from an early version of Minix, extensively modified for the Computing Surface architecture. Unlike HeliOS, another Unix-like transputer operating system, MeikOS is essentially a single-processor operating system with a distributed file system. MeikOS was intended for use with the &quot;Meiko Multiple Virtual Computing Surfaces&quot; (M²VCS) resource management software, which partitions the processors of a Computing Surface into &quot;domains&quot;, manages user access to these domains, and provides inter-domain communication.

MeikOS has &quot;diskless&quot; and &quot;fileserver&quot; variants, the former running on the seat processor of an M²VCS domain, providing a command line user interface for a given user; the latter running on processors with attached SCSI hard disks, providing a remote file service (named &quot;Surface File System&quot; (SFS)) to instances of diskless MeikOS. The two can communicate via M²VCS.

MeikOS was made obsolete by the introduction of the In-Sun Computing Surface and the Meiko MK083 SPARC processor board, which allow SunOS and &quot;Sun Virtual Computing Surfaces&quot; (SVCS), later developed as &quot;VCS&quot; to take over the roles of MeikOS and M²VCS respectively. The last MeikOS release was MeikOS 3.06, in early 1991.

===CS-1 Interconnect===
This was based on the transputer link protocol. Meiko developed its own switch silicon on and European Silicon Systems, ES2 gate array. This application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) provided static connectivity and limited dynamic connectivity and was designed by Moray McLaren.

==CS-2==
The CS-2 was launched in 1993 and was Meiko&#x27;s second-generation system architecture, superseding the earlier Computing Surface.

The CS-2 was an all-new modular architecture based around SuperSPARC or hyperSPARC processors and, optionally, Fujitsu μVP vector processors. These implemented an instruction set similar to the Fujitsu VP2000 vector supercomputer and had a nominal performance of 200 megaflops on double precision arithmetic and double that on single precision. The SuperSPARC processors ran at 40 MHz initially, later increased to 50 MHz. Subsequently, hyperSPARC processors were introduced at 66, 90 or 100 MHz. The CS-2 was intended to scale up to 1024 processors. The largest CS-2 system built was a 224-processor system installed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

The CS-2 ran a customized version of Sun&#x27;s operating system Solaris, initially Solaris 2.1, later 2.3 and 2.5.1.

===Elan-Elite Interconnect===
The processors in a CS-2 were connected by a Meiko-designed multi-stage packet-switched &quot;fat tree&quot; network implemented in custom silicon.

This project, codenamed Elan-Elite, was started in 1990, as a speculative project to compete with the T9000 Transputer from Inmos, which Meiko intended to use as an interconnect technology. The T9000 began to suffer massive delays, such that the internal project became the only viable interconnect choice for the CS-2.

This interconnect comprised two devices, code-named &quot;Elan&quot; (adapter) and &quot;Elite&quot; (switch). Each processing element included an Elan chip, a communications co-processor based on the SPARC architecture, accessed via a Sun MBus cache coherent interface and providing two 50 MB/s bi-directional links. The Elite chip was an 8-way link crossbar switch, used to form the packet-switched network. The switch had limited adaption based on load and priority.

Both ASICs were fabbed in complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) gate arrays by GEC Plessey in their Roborough, Plymouth semi-conductor fab in 1993.

After the Meiko technology was acquired by Quadrics, the Elan/Elite interconnect technology was developed into QsNet.

==Meiko SPARC FPU==
Meiko had hired Fred (Mark) Homewood and Moray McLaren both of whom had been instrumental in the design of the T800. Together, they designed and developed an improved, higher performance FPU core, owned by Meiko. This was initially targeted at the Intel 80387 instruction set. An ongoing legal battle between Intel, AMD and others over the 80387 made it clear this project was a commercial non-starter. A chance discussion between McLaren and Andy Bechtolsheim while visiting Sun Microsystems to discuss licensing Solaris caused Meiko to re-target the design for SPARC. Meiko was able to turn around the core FPU design in a short time and LSI Logic fabbed a device for the SPARCstation 1.

A major difference over the T800 FPU was that it fully implemented the IEEE 754 standard for computer arithmetic. This including all rounding modes, denormalised numbers and square root in hardware without taking any hardware exceptions to complete computation.

A SPARCstation 2 design was also developed together with a combined part targeting the SPARCstation 2 ASIC pinout. LSI fabbed and manufactured the separate FPU L64814, as part of their SparKIT chipset.

The Meiko design was eventually fully licensed to Sun which went on to use it in the MicroSPARC family of ASICs for several generations in return for a one-off payment and full Solaris source license.

<text>Island of the Sequined Love Nun is a novel by American absurdist writer Christopher Moore, published in 1997. It is based partly on the author&#x27;s personal experiences in Micronesia.

==Plot==
Tucker (Tuck) Case is a pilot for a cosmetics company, who crashes the company plane while having sex. This event causes Tuck to be blacklisted from flying in the United States, so he accepts a lucrative offer from a doctor-missionary on a remote Micronesian island to transport cargo to and from the island and Japan.

Tuck moves to the island with a Filipino trans woman navigator and a talking fruit bat. There Tuck eventually uncovers a horrible secret harbored by the doctor and his wife, who capitalized on the fact that the island natives are under the influence of a cargo cult that developed as a result of establishment by Allies of an air runway there during World War II.

==Shakespearean allusions==
In chapter 8, &quot;The Humiliation of the Pilot as a Passenger&quot;, Moore alludes to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Tuck is the heir to the Denmark Silverware Corporation, much like Hamlet being the prince. Later Tuck&#x27;s mother marries his uncle after her husband has a not-so-accidental riding accident resulting in his death.

Tuck is then summoned by an old girlfriend named Zoophilia (similar to Ophelia). While approaching the house in a rage he runs over Zoophilia&#x27;s father. Zoophilia meets her demise by taking a handful of Prozac and a mouthful of water then drowns in her hot tub, grief-stricken. Before Tuck leaves he is threatened by Zoophilia&#x27;s brother.

<doc id="102542" wikidata="Q1195289" url="?curid=102542" title="The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove">
<text>The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove is a novel by American writer Christopher Moore, published in 1999. It is set in the same fictional town of Pine Cove, California, as his first novel, &quot;Practical Demonkeeping&quot;, and also brings back some of the same characters.

==Plot summary==
Pine Cove suffers a major crisis when the town psychiatrist, Val Riordan — who has been haphazardly issuing prescriptions instead of dealing with the real mental problems of her patients — suffers a sudden bout of guilt and substitutes all of her patients&#x27; anti-depressants with placebos. At this same time, by coincidence, human-generated environmental activity stirs a prehistoric sea-beast from its underwater keep to come ashore.

In addition to its ability to change form, the beast exudes a pheromone that inspires uncontrollable lust among the residents of Pine Cove and also lures some of them as prey. After mistakenly trying to mate with a fuel truck (causing an explosion), the beast hides in a trailer park, attracting the curiosity of local crazy lady and former B-movie star Molly Michon, who builds a rapport with the injured beast.

Meanwhile, Theophilus Crowe, the town constable, investigates a strange suicide, the activities of his corrupt boss, and his adversely affected marijuana habit. When the beast (whom Molly has named &quot;Steve&quot;) starts eating residents of Pine Cove and interfering with Theo&#x27;s boss&#x27;s methamphetamine business, Molly (who has become romantically involved with the beast) and Theo band together to make possible the beast&#x27;s safe escape and to take down the boss at the same time.

==Reception==
James Sallis praised &quot;Lust Lizard&quot;, saying that Moore&#x27;s novel provides &quot;[like] all the best comic writing, something beyond jokes, caricature, spinning plates and crazy-tilt towers, something intangible that vanishes whenever we try to look directly at it: some sense, perhaps, that we&#x27;re still able to rescue from the ever-increasing detritus of our culture a decent, simple humanity.&quot;

<doc id="102544" wikidata="Q1770859" url="?curid=102544" title="Absurdist fiction">
<text>Absurdist fiction is a genre of novels, plays, poems, films, or other media that focuses on the experiences of characters in situations where they cannot find any inherent purpose in life, most often represented by ultimately meaningless actions and events that call into question the certainty of existential concepts such as truth or value. In some cases, it may overlap with literary nonsense.

The absurdist genre of literature arose in the 1950s and 1960s, first predominantly in France and Germany, prompted by post-war disillusionment. Absurdist fiction is a reaction against the surge in Romanticism in Paris in the 1830s, the collapse of religious tradition in Germany, and the societal and philosophical revolution led by the expressions of Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche.

Common elements in absurdist fiction include satire, dark humor, incongruity, the abasement of reason, and controversy regarding the philosophical condition of being &quot;nothing&quot;. Absurdist fiction in play form is known as Absurdist Theatre. Both genres are characterised by a focus on the experience of the characters, centred on the idea that life is incongruous, irreconcilable and meaningless. The integral characteristic of absurdist fiction involves the experience of the struggle to find an intrinsic purpose in life, depicted by characters in their display of meaningless actions in the futile events they take part in.

Absurdism as a philosophical movement is an extension of, or divergence from, Existentialism, which focuses on the pointlessness of mankind and specifically the emotional angst and anxiety present when the existence of purpose is challenged. Existentialist and agnostic perspectives are explored in absurdist novels and theatre in their expression of plot and characters. Major absurdist authors include Franz Kafka, Albert Camus, Samuel Beckett, and Eugène Ionesco.

== Characteristics ==
A great deal of absurdist fiction may be humorous or irrational in nature. The absurdist humor is described as a manner of comedy that relies on non-sequiturs, violation of causality, and unpredictable juxtapositions. However, the hallmark of the genre is neither comedy nor nonsense, but rather, the study of human behavior under circumstances (whether realistic or fantastical) that appear to be purposeless and philosophically absurd. Absurdist fiction posits little judgment about characters or their actions; that task is left to the reader. Also, the &quot;moral&quot; of the story is generally not explicit, and the themes or characters&#x27; realizations — if any — are often ambiguous in nature.

Additionally, unlike many other forms of fiction, absurdist works will not necessarily have a traditional plot structure (i.e., rising action, climax, falling action, etc.). The conventional elements of fiction such as plot, characterization, and development tend to be absent. Some scholars explain that this fiction entails a &quot;going away from&quot; a norm. There is also the case of the questioning of the validity of human reason, from which perceptions of the natural laws arise.

The absurdist fiction also does not seek to appeal to the so-called collective unconscious as it is fiercely individualistic and almost exclusively focuses on exploring an individual&#x27;s or a being&#x27;s subjective feelings of its existence.

==Overview==
The absurdist genre grew out of the modernist literature of the late 19th and early 20th century in direct opposition to the Victorian literature which was prominent just prior to this period. It was largely influenced by the existentialist and nihilist movements in philosophy, and the Dada and surrealist movements in art. Existential and nihilistic philosophical influences on absurdist fiction were resultant of the post-war disillusionment. Absurdist fiction novelists and composers demanded freedom from the conventions prevalent in the 1940 philosophical movement in France. Other historical events that impacted the literary movement&#x27;s style and philosophy include the atomic bomb and the Cold War.

Psychologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of British Columbia published a report in 2009 showing that reading absurdist tales improved test subjects&#x27; ability to find patterns. Their findings summarized that, when people have to work to find consistency and meaning in a fragmented story, it increases &quot;the cognitive mechanisms responsible for implicitly learning statistical regularities&quot;.

== Context and origins ==
Franz Kafka, Jean-Paul Sartre, Samuel Beckett, Eugène Ionesco, Albert Camus, Saul Bellow, Donald Barthelme and Cormac McCarthy are considered to be the most well-known composers of absurdist fiction. Kafka (1883–1924) was a German-speaking Bohemian novelist, and a notorious absurdist. Writers that influenced Kafka include Friedrich Nietzsche, Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Dickens and more. Kafka&#x27;s most popular fictional stories include &quot;The Judgment&quot;, published in 1912; &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;, published 1915; &quot;In the Penal Colony&quot;, published 1919; and &quot;A Hunger Artist&quot;, published 1922. &quot;The Trial&quot;, written between 1914 and 1915, is recognised as Kafka&#x27;s most well-known fiction. In its &quot;mythic symbolism of a world gone berserk&quot;, Kafka&#x27;s use of mythology, comedy, aphorism and surrealism epitomise the distinctive features of absurdist fiction. Franz Kafka&#x27;s influence on absurdism was so great that he is referred to by some as the &quot;King of the Absurd&quot; and a leader of the absurd movement. Others argue that Kafka was predominantly a Surrealist, however Kafka clarifies his unique style as &quot;the blend of absurd, surreal and mundane which gave rise to the adjective &#x27;Kafkaesque&#x27;&quot;. Samuel Beckett was also an early absurdist; an Irish novelist, playwright, short story writer, theatre director, poet, and literary translator. Beckett&#x27;s well-known &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, premiered in 1953, is classified within absurdist theatre using techniques of tragicomedy. The characteristics introduced by Beckett included bitter humour and despair, and a vivid and spontaneous improvisation on the absurdity of theatre (Dickson, Andrew, 2017). Eugène Ionesco was a Romanian French playwright, one of the foremost composers of French avant-garde theatre and a leader of absurdism. Ionesco&#x27;s &quot;The Chairs&quot; (1952) was branded as a &quot;tragic farce&quot; by Ionesco himself in its experimentation of absurdist motifs, existentialism and nonsensical verse, of which elaborates on incommunicability in our human lives.

== Ideology ==
The term &quot;absurd&quot; has roots in the Latin &quot;absurdus&quot;, meaning &quot;contrary to reason&quot; or &quot;inharmonious&quot;. The term elaborates on the concept of the modern word corresponding to the identification of the irrational and incongruous nature of everyday life. The ideology and philosophy behind the absurdist fiction genre stems from nihilism and existentialism extracted from the 20th-century world. Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855), known as the &quot;father of existentialism&quot;, was a prolific Danish writer who opposed conventional boundaries of philosophy, psychology, theology, fiction and literary criticism. Kierkegaard&#x27;s philosophy contends with the plausibility of Christendom, and inherently disputes the sense of purpose it prompts in personal life. The concept of the absurd was used by Kierkegaard to term the point in which faith becomes indefensible, yet valid for those who employ it, and it alone. Kierkegaard heavily influenced the work of Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. Existentialism as a philosophical approach or theory emphasises the single individual&#x27;s existence and the concept of an individual as a free agent in determining their own meaning or purpose in life. On the other hand, nihilism is the recognition that life has no intrinsic meaning. Absurdist fiction in relation to existentialism expresses what happens when human existence has no meaning or purpose, therefore all communication breaks down. Eugène Ionesco&#x27;s &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot; (1950) is an absurdist fiction text which emphasises in depth the notion of mankind&#x27;s inability to communicate with each other. Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) was a cultural critic, composer, poet, philologist, and a Latin and Greek egg scholar who also yielded profound inspiration in Western philosophy and modern intellectual history. Nietzsche is another primary influencer on the philosophy and ideology behind the absurd. His interest in nihilism, in particular his views on Christianity and God, alludes to the traditions of the Western world in their reliance on religion as a &quot;moral compass&quot; and source of meaning. Nietzsche claimed that this dependence is now unviable, appearing in his novel &quot;The Gay Science&quot;, published 1882, translated in 1974. The writings of Nietzsche influenced absurdist fiction in the influence on Sartre and Albert Camus. Particularly, Camus&#x27; understanding of nihilism was heavily motivated by the conception that Nietzsche put forth of life and death and the nihilistic perspectives of such.

=== Absurdist fiction in novels ===
French writer Albert Camus is the novelist that most literary critics date the concept of absurdist fiction to, with Camus&#x27; most famous novel, &quot;L&#x27;Étranger&quot; (&quot;The Stranger&quot;, 1942), and his philosophical essay &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; (1942). The Bohemian, German-speaking, Franz Kafka is another absurdist fiction novelist. Kafka&#x27;s novel &quot;The Trial&quot; was published in 1925 after Kafka&#x27;s death in 1924. Kafka&#x27;s novel encompasses mankind&#x27;s inability to engage in communication in a purposeless world.

===Characteristics and techniques===
Albert Camus&#x27; &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; (1942) extracts from the Greek fable of a man forced to continuously roll a rock up a mountain only for it to roll back down the mountain due to its own weight, a dilemma that lasts for eternity. Camus elucidates his own symbolism as a representation of the human condition in a world where we face the universal difficulty of making sense of events; however instead of turning to suicide that we must reconcile with the &quot;elusive feeling of absurdity&quot; and endure it to the best of our abilities. Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Trial&quot; (1925) follows the tale of Josef K., a man who is arrested and prosecuted by an authority that is remote and inaccessible; both him and the reader are not told the nature of his crime or why he was prosecuted. Kafka uses restrained prose throughout the novel to add dramatic irony as well as the illogical and inconsistent line of events of the arrest and court case of Joseph K. Kafka&#x27;s novel can be perceived to imply a gap in the rational world as a result of hyper-rationalization consuming society, an example highlighted by Kafka being the judiciary. Kafka employs erroneous alliteration and literary manipulation to compose a nonsensical, existentialist novel that exemplifies the inhumanity, alienation and absurdity persisting in the modern world alongside the impacts of totalitarianism, injustice and bureaucracy as a whole.

==Theatre of the Absurd==

The Theatre of the Absurd is termed as a post-World War One designation for absurdist fiction plays, specifically those written by primarily European playwrights in the late twentieth century, also as one for the style of theatre which has evolved from their work. Martin Esslin, a literary critic, coined the term &quot;Theatre of the Absurd&quot; in his 1960 essay &quot;Theatre of the Absurd&quot;. Esslin related these selected plays based on the broad theme of the absurd, similar to the way Camus used the term in his 1942 essay &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;. The ideology of the Theatre of the Absurd is drawn from existentialism and expresses the result of human existence becoming deprived of meaning or purpose and the result of all communication thus breaking down. Logical construction and argument within absurdist theatre gave way to characteristics of irrational and illogical speech and the ultimate conclusion of silence. The Theatre of the Absurd involves a fascination with absurdity in a range of forms; the existential, philosophical, emotional and dramaturgical. The Theatre of the Absurd as a dramatic form inherently pushes theatre to the extreme, while posing questions about what both reality and unreality truly look like. Martin Esslin named the four defining playwrights of the Theatre of the Absurd movement as Samuel Beckett, Arthur Adamov, Eugène Ionesco, and Jean Genet. In later editions of his essay he included a fifth playwright, Harold Pinter. Other writers that are also associated with this movement by Esslin and other critics are Tom Stoppard, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Fernando Arrabal, Edward Albee, Boris Vian, and Jean Tardieu.

===Characteristics===
The Theatre of the Absurd subverts conventional theatrical form audiences have come to expect when viewing a play. Movement of the plot is arbitrary; characters of absurdist theatre are mostly unfamiliar and strangely motivated, scenery is often unrecognizable and sometimes unchanging or desolate, and dialogue appears to be nonsense. To absurdist playwrights, and irrationality represent reality better than rationality and order. Plays can be both tragic and comic in nature, characteristic of the tragicomedy genre in theatre.

===Examples===
* Alliteration
* Repetition
* Lists
* Allusion
* Dramatic devices
* Neologism 
* Convolution
* Stream of consciousness
* Irony
* Satire

=== Theatre of the Absurd plays ===
Eugène Ionesco&#x27;s &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot; (1950) is a memorable absurdist theatre play. Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; (1953) is an absurdist theatre play with two acts using dramatic techniques. Other examples include Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s play &quot;No Exit&quot; (1944), Max Frisch&#x27;s play &quot;The Firebugs&quot; (1953) and Ezio D&#x27;Errico&#x27;s play &quot;The Anthill and Time of the Locusts&quot; (1954). Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Long Christmas Dinner&quot; (1931) and Jean Tardieu&#x27;s &quot;Underground Lovers&quot; (1934) are earlier examples.

=== Techniques and devices examples ===
Romanian-French playwright Eugène Ionesco&#x27;s &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot; (1950) is a dominating play central to the Theatre of the Absurd, its &quot;dreamlike symphony of nonsensical speech and disjointed associations expose how hopeless human communication is&quot;. The &quot;nonsensical speech&quot; and &quot;disjointed associations&quot; are key elements of the Theatre of the Absurd. Most of the dialogue in Ionesco&#x27;s play has little meaning and frequently there is outright gibberish in the actors&#x27; speeches. The satire and nonsensical discourse present throughout Ionesco&#x27;s text serves his purpose in presenting how nonsensical mundane life can be. Ionesco&#x27;s engagement with existentialism is also characteristic of absurdist theatre, and distinct in the utilisation of the seemingly ridiculous English language and society&#x27;s unwillingness to communicate with each other. Ionesco&#x27;s &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot; encompasses mankind&#x27;s inability to engage in communication in a purposeless world, reiterating the influence of Existentialism on Absurdist Fiction and how this presents in texts within the Theatre of the Absurd literary genre.

Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; (1953), an originally French text, is an absurdist theatre drama that is described as one of the most important plays of the 20th century despite its early reception. The play was first performed on January 5, 1953, at Theatre de babylone in Paris. The reception of the play in the 1950s can be interpreted by critics reviews. Literary critic Vivian Mercer claimed that the play was &quot;a play in which nothing happens, twice&quot;, alluding to the two acts that take a cyclical form. Alfonso Sastre, another literary critic reviewing Beckett&#x27;s text, described the play as &quot;a death certificate for hope&quot;; he continues, &quot;what is so fascinating about waiting for Godot; [is] that nothing happens. It is a lucid testimony of nothingness.&quot; Beckett&#x27;s desolate universe in his play is rendered by Absurdist techniques; an unchanging landscape, characters subjected to random and whimsical acts of violence with cyclical discourse. Beckett captures the sense of perpetual anticipation for meaning in humanity in the portrayal of the relationship between &#x27;Gogo&#x27; and &#x27;Didi&#x27;, a strong interdependence mixed with irritability. The tragicomedy element to Beckett&#x27;s absurdist fiction play adds a comic futility that can be compared to slapstick comedy and cartoon characters such as the characters Tom and Jerry. The relationship between the two characters in &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; (Vladimir and Estragon) is whimsical, interdependent yet irritable. Their nature, dialogue and interactions are reminiscent of familiar comical duos such as Laurel and Hardy and Tom and Jerry.

<text>C. D. Payne (born C. Douglas Payne; July 5, 1949) is an American writer of absurdist fiction who is best known for his series of novels about fictional teenager Nick Twisp. They are called the &quot;Youth in Revolt&quot; series or &quot;The Journals of Nick Twisp.&quot;

In the novels the protagonist, Nick, strives to balance out his budding sexual urges while remaining an intellectual teenager in a world of moronic adults.

Along with the &quot;Youth&quot; series he is the author of several other novels including &quot;Frisco Pigeon Mambo&quot; and &quot;Civic Beauties&quot;, a parody of politics in the United States, which follows the lives of teenage twin girls whose father is campaigning to be Vice President. He has also published a play titled, &quot;Queen of America: A Royal Comedy in Three Acts&quot;. &quot;Frisco Pigeon Mambo&quot; was bought by Fox Animation, but was never made into a film.

&quot;Youth in Revolt&quot; was developed and distributed by Dimension Films in January 2010.

==Personal life==
Payne was born in Akron, Ohio, in 1949, and graduated from Harvard College in 1971. He then moved to California and lived in a trailer in Santa Monica. He has worked as a newspaper editor, cartoonist, typesetter, graphic artist, proofreader, photographer, advertising copywriter, trailer park handyman, and carpenter. Many of his recent novels and stories are set in the 1950s.

He is married and lives with his pet in Sonoma County, California.

Payne is an avid collector of campers, mobile homes, and trailers. His most prized possession is a 1964 Airstream trailer.

*Michelle Goldberg is an American journalist and author, and an op-ed columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Like most Americans, Wineburg had been unaware of the power Moon holds in our nation&#x27;s politics.

<doc id="102554" wikidata="Q3000" url="?curid=102554" title="District of Duchy of Lauenburg">
<text>Duchy of Lauenburg ( ) is the southernmost &quot;Kreis&quot;, or district, officially called District of Duchy of Lauenburg (), of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is bordered by (from the west and clockwise) the district of Stormarn, the city of Lübeck, the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (districts of Nordwestmecklenburg and Ludwigslust-Parchim), the state of Lower Saxony (districts of Lüneburg and Harburg), and the city state of Hamburg. The district of Herzogtum Lauenburg is named after the former Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg.

==Geography==
The district&#x27;s territory comprises most of the former Duchy&#x27;s territory north of the river Elbe, except of the Amt Neuhaus. All the former Saxe-Lauenburgian areas beyond the Elbe belong today to the Lower Saxon districts of Cuxhaven (Land of Hadeln), Harburg and Lüneburg.

The district&#x27;s area contains a number of historically important towns, e.g. Lauenburg/Elbe, Mölln and Ratzeburg. This importance was due to the Old Salt Route (&quot;Alte Salzstraße&quot;), one of the major medieval trade routes. Salt from the salt-works south of the Elbe river was transported northward to Lübeck. The transport of salt was also the motive for constructing the oldest artificial waterway of Europe, the Stecknitz Canal (1398). It was replaced in 1900 by the Elbe-Lübeck Canal.

The landscape is characterised by numerous lakes, forming the Lauenburg Lakes Nature Park. The largest lake is the Ratzeburger See with an area of 16 km2.

==History==

The district Herzogtum Lauenburg is named after the medieval Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg, which was one of the remnants of the original Duchy of Saxony. The Duchy of Saxony was partitioned in a process started in 1269, nine years after in 1260 Albert II and John I had succeeded their father Albert I of Saxony. In 1269, 1272 and 1282, the brothers gradually divided their governing competences within the three territorially unconnected Saxon areas along the Elbe river (one called Land of Hadeln, another around Lauenburg upon Elbe and the third around Wittenberg upon Elbe), thus preparing a partition.

After John I&#x27;s resignation in 1282, Albert II ruled with his still minor nephews Albert III, Eric I and John II, who by 1296 definitely partitioned the duchy providing Saxe-Lauenburg for the brothers, and Saxe-Wittenberg for their uncle Albert II. The last document, mentioning the brothers and their uncle Albert II as Saxon fellow dukes dates back to 1295. A deed of 20 September 1296, circumscribing Saxe-Lauenburg, mentions the Vierlande (now Hamburg), Sadelbande (Land of Lauenburg), the Land of Ratzeburg, the Land of Darzing (later Amt Neuhaus), and the Land of Hadeln (the latter two now Lower Saxony) as the joint territory of the brothers, separate of Saxe-Wittenberg.

Saxe-Lauenburg was also known simply as Lauenburg. While the territory of Saxe-Wittenberg changed drastically over the centuries, the Duchy of Lauenburg remained almost unchanged, until it lost its independence in 1689, when it was inherited by the Principality of Lüneburg. From 1815–1864 it was ruled in personal union by the Duke of Holstein, being simultaneously King of Denmark. In 1864 it fell to Prussia after the Second Schleswig War. For a short period Lauenburg was still an autonomous entity, but in 1876 it was incorporated as a district into the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein.

Lauenburg upon Elbe was the first capital and name-giving to the Duchy, before it moved in 1619 to Ratzeburg, which remained the capital also when the Duchy was downgraded to a district within Prussia. In 1937—by a territorial redeployment within the scope of the Greater Hamburg Act—the city of Geesthacht (formerly a part of Hamburg), some Mecklenburgian exclaves, including Ratzeburg&#x27;s &quot;Cathedral immunity district&quot;, and some Lübeckian exclaves within the district territory, were incorporated into the district.

In May 1945 British forces captured the district territory, which in September 1944 had been determined in the London Protocol to become part of the British Zone of Occupation. On 13 November 1945 the British general Colin Muir Barber and the Soviet general major Nikolay Grigoryevich Lyashchenko () signed the (or the Gadebusch Agreement) in Gadebusch, redeploying some municipalities of the &quot;Duchy of Lauenburg District&quot; and neighbouring Mecklenburg, then part of the Soviet Zone of Occupation. Thus some eastern suburbs of Ratzeburg, such as Ziethen in Lauenburg, Mechow, Bäk and Römnitz became part of the district, while the Lauenburgian municipalities of Dechow, Groß and Klein Thurow (now component parts of Roggendorf) as well as Lassahn (now a component part of Zarrentin am Schaalsee) were ceded to Mecklenburg. The redeployment was accomplished on 26 November, the respective occupational forces had until 28 November to withdraw to their respective new zonal territories.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms displays a white horse, the ancient symbol of the duchy of Saxony. The horse is surrounded by a black and white checked border, which represents the colours of Prussia. This is a modified version of the arms used when Saxe-Lauenburg was ruled in personal union with the Danish monarchy, 1815-64. The former arms featured a golden horse&#x27;s head on a red shield.

The coat of arms was granted on 12 November 1866, after the Hohenzollern dynasty started to rule Saxe-Lauenburg in personal union with the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1876 the duchy was incorporated in a real union into Prussia, forming a district within the Prussian Province of Schleswig-Holstein. The usage of the coat of arms was discontinued, as then districts were not allowed to use coats of arms. Today the coat of arms is used by the district, displayed with a crown on top.

From 1873–82 the Hereditary Land Marshal (&quot;Erblandmarschall&quot;) was responsible for administration of the district and the appointment of offices. The &quot;landrat&quot; (about in ), as a Prussian official, dealt only with the national administration.

*1873–1874: &quot;Regierungsassessor&quot; Jungbluth
*1874–1881: Graf Andreas von Bernstorff

After 1 October 1882 the &quot;Landrat&quot; became responsible also for local administration, free from state control.

*1882–1897: Oskar von Dolega-Kozierowski
*1897–1900: Graf Finck von Finckenstein
*1900–1907: Friedrich von Bülow
*1907–1919: Emil Mathis
*1919–1927: Kurt Schönberg
*1927–1933: Gustav Voigt
*1933–1938: Theodor Fründt, NSDAP
*1939–1945: Erich Jüttner, NSDAP

A change in government came about after the Second World War with the 1946 county statute issued by the British military government. The &quot;Landrat&quot; now temporarily functioned as an honorary head of the district council (&quot;Kreistag&quot;), which now dealt with the administration of the district directly. Later, however, the &quot;Landrat&quot; took over the district administration again.

*1945–1946: Ewald Raaz
*1946–1948: Wilhelm Gülich, SPD
*1948–1950: Fritz Vagt, CDU
*1950–1969: Gerhard Wandschneider
*1969–1975: Klaus Prößdorf
*1975–2002: Günter Kröpelin, CDU
*2002–2015: Gerd Krämer, independent
*2015–present: Dr. Christoph Mager, CDU

===District President===
The District President (&quot;Kreispräsident&quot;) is the chairman of the district council and is selected from its members. The president chairs the meetings of the council and represents the district, together with the landrat, abroad.

* 19??–1994: Norbert Brackmann, CDU
* 1994–2003: Helga Hinz, SPD
* 2003–present: Meinhard Füllner, CDU

===Organisation===
Contrary to others in Schleswig-Holstein, this district is characterised by numerous relatively small municipalities, which practise direct democracy and citizens&#x27; participation. The administration most often takes place via offices, which are often of a very manageable size. To that extent, the scope of the planned Schleswig-Holstein Administrative Structure Law will be quite significant: according to the draft of the Ministry of the Interior, a minimum size of 8000 inhabitants was to be implemented for &quot;Ämter&quot; and independent municipalities as a regional reorganisation due 1 April 2007. Thus, the existence of six of the eleven &quot;Ämter&quot; of the district is threatened. However, a minimum size for municipalities belonging to an &quot;Amt&quot; has not yet been officially determined. Until the deadline, the possibility for voluntary unions exists, which, according to the draft, may as well cross district boundaries.
The economical emphasis of the district lies on the Hamburg bacon-belt, while the eastern parts in the Lauenburg Lakes Nature Park with their abundance of water cater more to tourism and are largely focused on agriculture. The district belongs to Hamburg Metropolitan Region.

==Transportation==
* In 2003, the public transit system in the district was integrated into the &quot;Hamburger Verkehrsverbund&quot; (HVV).
* Connections to the Autobahn network are provided by the A1 (Hamburg–Lübeck) in the west, the A 24 (Hamburg–Berlin) in the south, the A 25 (Geesthacht–Hamburg) and the A 20 (Lübeck–Rostock) in the north of the district.
* Railway connections exist from Hamburg to Büchen and on to Berlin; and from Lüneburg to Büchen and on to Lübeck, via Mölln/Ratzeburg. Both routes are operated by Deutsche Bahn AG. From Bergedorf to Geesthacht, there is still the old Bergedorf-Geesthachter Eisenbahn (BGE) freight route, which now serves as a museum railway line, belonging to the privately operated AKN Eisenbahn.
*The Elbe harbour of Lauenburg/Elbe constitutes one end of the Elbe-Lübeck Canal, established in 1900. Via the Trave river, it connects the Central European network of canals to Lübeck and the Baltic Sea. The canal served as a part of the Old Salt Route.
* Nearby airports are Lübeck Airport and Hamburg Airport.

<text>The University of Tromsø – The Arctic University of Norway (Norwegian: &quot;Universitetet i Tromsø – Norges arktiske universitet&quot;; Northern Sami: &quot;Romssa universitehta – Norgga árktalaš universitehta&quot;) is a state university in Norway and the world&#x27;s northernmost university. Located in the city of Tromsø, Norway, it was established by an act of parliament in 1968, and opened in 1972. It is one of ten universities in Norway. The University of Tromsø is the largest research and educational institution in Northern Norway and the sixth-largest university in Norway. The university&#x27;s location makes it a natural venue for the development of studies of the region&#x27;s natural environment, culture, and society.

The main focus of the university&#x27;s activities is on auroral light research, space science, fishery science, biotechnology, linguistics, multicultural societies, Saami culture, telemedicine, epidemiology and a wide spectrum of Arctic research projects. The close vicinity of the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research and the Polar Environmental Centre gives Tromsø added weight and importance as an international centre for Arctic research. Research activities, however, are not limited to Arctic studies. The university researchers work within a broad range of subjects and are recognised both nationally and internationally.

==History==
===Mergers===
On 1 January 2009, the University of Tromsø merged with Tromsø University College. The college&#x27;s teacher education department (the descendant of the Tromsø Seminarium first established in 1848) became part of the university&#x27;s department of education and pedagogy. On 1 August 2013, the university merged with Finnmark University College to form &quot;Universitetet i Tromsø – Norges arktiske universitet&quot; (The University of Tromsø – The Arctic University of Norway), thereby adding campuses in Alta, Hammerfest, and Kirkenes. On 1 January 2016, Narvik University College and Harstad University College merged with UiT - The Arctic University of Norway. As of September 2024 the university has eleven campus locations in northern Norway, the main campus being Tromsø.

===Spy case in 2022===

In October 2022 a guest researcher at UiT was arrested by the Norwegian Police Security Service and charged with espionage against Norway. The researcher posed as a Brazilian researcher named José Assis Giammaria, but later revealed that he is a Russian citizen by the name Mikhail Valerijevitsj Mikusjin.

Mikusjin is a suspected illegalist who worked for the Russian intelligence service GRU.

<doc id="102559" wikidata="Q3707361" url="?curid=102559" title="Gay panic defense">
<text>The gay panic defense or homosexual advance defense is a victim blaming strategy of legal defense, which refers to a situation in which a heterosexual individual charged with a violent crime against a homosexual (or bisexual) individual claims they lost control and reacted violently because of an unwanted sexual advance that was made upon them. A defendant will use available legal defenses against assault and murder, with the aim of seeking an acquittal, a mitigated sentence, or a conviction of a lesser offense. A defendant may allege to have found the same-sex sexual advances so offensive or frightening that they were provoked into reacting, were acting in self-defense, were of diminished capacity, or were temporarily insane, and that this circumstance is exculpatory or mitigating.

The  is a closely related legal strategy applied in cases of assault or murder of a transgender individual whom the assailant(s) had engaged with, or were close to engaging with, in sexual relations, and claim to have been unaware that the victim was transgender, producing in the attacker an alleged trans panic reaction. In most cases, the violence or murder is perpetrated by a heterosexual man against a trans woman.

Broadly, the defenses may be called the &quot;gay and trans panic defense&quot; or the &quot;LGBTQ+ panic defense&quot;.

== History ==
The gay panic defense grew out of a combination of legal defenses from the mid-nineteenth century and a mental disorder described in the early twentieth, seeking to apply the legal framework of the temporary insanity defense, provocation defense, or self-defense, often by using the mental condition of &quot;homosexual panic disorder&quot;.

=== Homosexual panic disorder ===
Homosexual panic seen as a mental health disorder is distinct from the homosexual panic defense within the legal system. Whereas homosexual panic disorder was at one point considered a diagnosable medical condition, the legal defense implies only a temporary loss of self-control.

Edward J. Kempf, a psychiatrist, coined the term &quot;homosexual panic&quot; in 1920 and identified it as a condition of &quot;panic due to the pressure of uncontrollable perverse sexual cravings&quot;, and classified it as an acute pernicious dissociative disorder, meaning that it involved a disruption in typical perception and memory functions. Kempf identified the condition during and after World War I at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C.

The disorder was briefly included in DSM-1 as a supplementary term in Appendix C but did not appear in any subsequent editions of DSM and thus is not considered a diagnosable condition by the American Psychiatric Association.

Unlike the legal defense created later and named after it, the onset of the condition was not attributed to unwanted homosexual advances. Rather, Kempf stated that it was caused by the individual&#x27;s own &quot;aroused homosexual cravings&quot;.

=== Types of defenses ===
The gay panic defense strategy usually falls into three categories of defenses: the provocation defense, self defense (including imperfect self defense) and insanity based defenses (including temporary insanity, irresistible impulse, and diminished responsibility). The gay panic defense is not a stand-alone defense, but rather a legal tactic used by the defense which seeks to obtain an acquittal, a mitigated sentence, or a conviction of a lesser offense.

The defense is commonly defined by the attempt to shift the blame onto the victim&#x27;s sexual orientation or gender identity of the victim as a form of victim blaming.

==Jurisdictions==
===Australia===
In Australia, it is known as the &quot;homosexual advance defence&quot; (HAD). Of the status of the HAD in Australia, Kent Blore wrote in 2012:

In Australia, as of 2023, all Australian states have either abolished the provocation defense altogether (Tasmania in 2003, Victoria in 2005, Western Australia in 2008 and South Australia in 2020), or have restricted its application. Queensland restricted the defense of provocation in 2011, and further restricted it in 2017 (with a clause to allow it in &#x27;exceptional circumstances&#x27; to be determined by a magistrate). In a differing approach, New South Wales, the ACT and Northern Territory have implemented changes to stipulate that non-violent sexual advances (of any kind, including homosexual) are not a valid defense. In New South Wales, the law on provocation was amended to provide that the provocative conduct of the deceased must also have constituted a serious indictable offense.

Garry Wait, a 20-year-old waiter, mounted an unsuccessful gay panic defence after being charged with the murder of 63-year-old former federal MP Bill Arthur in 1982. Wait not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter, on the grounds that Arthur had made &quot;homosexual advances&quot;. The jury rejected his account of the killing, convicting him of murder. He was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment.

South Australia was the first Australian jurisdiction to legalize consensual homosexual acts in 1975; however, it was the only Australian jurisdiction not to have repealed or overhauled the gay panic defense. In 2015, the South Australian state government was awaiting the report from the South Australian Law Reform Institute and the outcome of the appeal to the High Court from the Court of Criminal Appeal of South Australia. In 2011, Andrew Negre was killed by Michael Lindsay bashing and stabbing him. Lindsay&#x27;s principal defense was that he stabbed Negre in the chest and abdomen but Negre&#x27;s death was the result of someone else slitting Negre&#x27;s throat. The secondary defense was that Lindsay&#x27;s action in stabbing Negre was because he had lost self-control after Negre made sexual advances towards him and offered to pay Lindsay for sex. The jury convicted Lindsay of murder and he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 23-year non-parole period. The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the conviction, finding that the directions to the jury on the gay panic defense were flawed, but that every reasonable jury would have found that an ordinary person would not have lost self-control and acted in the way Lindsay did. The High Court held that a properly instructed jury might have found that an offer of money for sex made by a Caucasian man to an Aboriginal man in the latter&#x27;s home and in the presence of his wife and family may have had a pungency that an unwelcome sexual advance made by one man toward another in other circumstances would not have. Lindsay was re-tried and was again convicted of murder. The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the conviction, and an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court was dismissed. In April 2017, the South Australian Law Reform Institute recommended that the law of provocation be reformed to remove discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender, but that the removal of a non-violent sexual advance as a partial defence to murder be deferred until stage 2 of the report was produced. Finally, in 2020, South Australia abolished the defense of provocation altogether.

===New Zealand===
In 2003, a gay interior designer and former television host, David McNee, was killed by a part-time sex worker, Phillip Layton Edwards. Edwards said at his trial that he told McNee he was not gay, but would masturbate in front of him on a &quot;no-touch&quot; basis for money. The defense successfully argued that Edwards, who had 56 previous convictions and had been on parole for 11 days, was provoked into beating McNee after he violated their &quot;no touching&quot; agreement. Edwards was jailed for nine years for manslaughter.

In July 2009, Ferdinand Ambach, 32, a Hungarian tourist, was convicted of killing Ronald Brown, 69, by hitting him with a banjo and shoving the instrument&#x27;s neck down Brown&#x27;s throat. Ambach was initially charged with murder, but the charge was downgraded to manslaughter after Ambach&#x27;s lawyer successfully invoked the gay panic defense.

On November 26, 2009, the New Zealand Parliament voted to abolish Section 169 of the Crimes Act 1961, removing the provocation defense from New Zealand law, although it was argued by some that this change was more a result of the failed provocation defense in the Sophie Elliott murder trial by her ex-boyfriend.

=== Philippines ===
Lance Cpl. Joseph Scott Pemberton, a U.S. Marine from Massachusetts, was convicted of homicide (but not of murder) in the killing of Jennifer Laude in a motel room in Olongapo in the Philippines in 2014. Police said that Pemberton became enraged after discovering that Laude was transgender. After Pemberton served six years of a ten-year sentence, President Rodrigo Duterte gave him an absolute pardon. Sen. Imee Marcos said the pardon would help the Philippines maintain &quot;very deep and very cordial&quot; relations with the US.

===United Kingdom===
Guidance given to counsel by the Crown Prosecution Service of England and Wales states: &quot;The fact that the victim made a sexual advance on the defendant does not, of itself, automatically provide the defendant with a defence of self-defence for the actions that they then take.&quot; In the UK, it has been known for decades as the &quot;Portsmouth defence&quot; or the &quot;guardsman&#x27;s defence&quot;. The latter term was used in a 1980 episode of &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;.

In December 2024, the CPS issued updated guidance regarding &quot;deception as to sex&quot; in sexual assault cases. The guidance suggests that deception or non-disclosure about one&#x27;s birth sex could impact consent, and such cases may result in criminal charges.

===United States===
====Federal laws====
In 2018, Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) and Representative Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) introduced S.3188 and H.R.6358, respectively, which would ban the gay and trans panic defense at the national level. Both bills died in committee.

In June 2019, the bill was reintroduced in both houses of Congress as the Gay and Trans Panic Defense Prohibition Act of 2019 (S.1721 and H.R.3133). The bills would prohibit a federal criminal defendant from asserting, as a defense, that the nonviolent sexual advance of an individual or a perception or belief of the gender, gender identity, or expression, or sexual orientation of an individual excuses or justifies conduct or mitigates the severity of an offense. Similarly to S.3188, after being sent to committee, the bill died at the end of 2020, and was re-introduced (as S.1137) in April 2021. It was reintroduced in January 2023.

====State laws====
In 2006, the California State Legislature amended the Penal Code to include jury instructions to ignore bias, sympathy, prejudice, or public opinion in making their decision, and a directive was made to educate district attorneys&#x27; offices about panic strategies and how to prevent bias from affecting trial outcomes. The American Bar Association (ABA) unanimously passed a resolution in 2013 urging governments to follow California&#x27;s lead in prescribing explicit juror instructions to ignore bias and to educate prosecutors about panic defenses.

Following the ABA&#x27;s resolution in 2013, the LGBT Bar is continuing to work with concerned lawmakers at the state level to help ban the use of this tactic in courtrooms across the country.

On September 27, 2014, Governor Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill No. 2501, making California the first state in the US to ban the gay and trans panic defense. AB 2501 states that discovery of, knowledge about, or potential disclosure of the victim&#x27;s actual or perceived gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation does not, by itself, constitute sufficient provocation to justify a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter.

In August 2017, Bruce Rauner, Governor of Illinois, signed SB1761, banning the gay and trans panic defenses in that state.

In June 2018, H7066aa and S3014, bills to prohibit the gay and trans panic defense passed the Rhode Island Assembly with overwhelming margins: The House voted 68–2 and the Senate voice voted 27–0. The Governor of Rhode Island signed the bill into law a month later in July 2018. The law went into effect immediately.

In 2019, the New York State Legislature once again considered banning the gay panic defense. For the 2019–2020 session, the bills considered were S3293 and A2707; prior versions of the bill have died in committee (S7048, 2013–14 session; A5467/S499, 2015–16 session; A5001/S50, 2017–18 session). On June 30, 2019, the day of the NYC Pride March, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the ban into law, effective immediately.

In April 2019, both houses of the Hawaii State Legislature passed bills to prohibit the gay and trans panic defense (HB711 and SB2). A conference committee was set up to reconcile the two versions of the bill; the reconciled bill passed both houses on April 26, 2019, and was signed into law two months later, on June 26, 2019, by the Governor David Ige. It went into effect immediately.

In May 2019, the Nevada Legislature passed SB97 to prohibit the gay and trans panic defense used within Nevada state courts and tribunals. On May 14, 2019, Governor Steve Sisolak signed SB97 into law. The law went into effect on October 1, 2019.

In June 2019, the Connecticut General Assembly passed SB-0058 unanimously to prohibit the trans and gay panic defense. The bill was signed into law by Governor Ned Lamont. The law went into effect on October 1, 2019, as per the rules governed under the Constitution of Connecticut.

Also in June 2019, the Maine Legislature passed a bill (House vote 132–1 and Senate vote 35–0), which was signed by Governor Janet Mills on June 21, 2019, to ban the &quot;gay and trans panic defense&quot; effective immediately.

New Jersey passed a bill without a single vote in opposition to ban the gay and trans panic defense; it was signed into law in January 2020.
In February 2020, the Washington State Legislature passed a bill (House vote 90–5 with 3 excused and Senate vote 46–3) to abolish the gay panic defense. The bill was signed into law in March 2020, by the Governor of Washington State Jay Inslee. Washington state became the tenth US state to ban the gay panic defense when the law went into effect in June 2020.

In July 2020, Colorado became the 11th US state to abolish the gay panic defense. The final vote was 63–1–1 in the House and 35–0 in the Senate. 

In December 2020, the Council of the District of Columbia unanimously voted on a bill to ban the use of the &quot;gay and trans panic defense&quot;. Mayor Muriel Bowser said she would sign the measure. The bill will then go to Capitol Hill for a 30 legislative day review by Congress, required by the District of Columbia Home Rule Act.

As of January 2021, similar bills have been introduced in several other states.

In 2023, New Hampshire enacted HB 315, sponsored by Rep. Shaun Filiault. The state officially became the first Republican-controlled state to abolish the gay and trans panic defense, and went into effect on midnight January 1, 2024.

Effective from August 1, 2024, Minnesota implemented a law explicitly banning the gay and trans panic defense within an omnibus justice bill passed and signed into law in May 2024. 

The Michigan legislature passed a ban on the use of the gay and trans panic defense on June 27, 2024. The bill was signed into law by Governor Gretchen Whitmer on July 23, 2024.

==== Use of the gay panic defense ====
The gay panic defense is invoked as an affirmative defense, but only to strengthen a more &quot;traditional criminal law defense such as insanity, diminished capacity, provocation, or self-defense&quot; and is not meant to provide justification of the crime on its own. While using the gay panic defense to explain insanity has typically not been successful in winning a complete acquittal, diminished capacity, provocation, and self-defense have all been used successfully to reduce charges and sentences.

Historically, in US courts, use of the gay panic defense has not typically resulted in the acquittal of the defendant; instead, the defendant was usually found guilty, but on lesser charges, or judges and juries may have cited homosexual solicitation as a mitigating factor, resulting in reduced culpability and sentences.

In 1995, the tabloid talk show &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot; filmed an episode titled &quot;Revealing Same Sex Secret Crush&quot;. Scott Amedure, a 32-year-old gay man, publicly revealed on the program that he was a secret admirer of Jonathan Schmitz, a 24-year old straight man. Three days after the episode was filmed, Schmitz confronted and killed Amedure. Schmitz was tried for the first-degree murder of Scott Amedure; however, he was convicted on the lesser offense of second-degree murder after asserting the gay panic defense.

====Uses of the trans panic defense====

* In the 1997 murder of Chanelle Pickett, William C. Palmer claimed that he attacked Pickett after discovering she &quot;was actually a man&quot;. However, when the victim&#x27;s sister and other witnesses revealed that Palmer was aware of Pickett&#x27;s trans status, Palmer abandoned this defense.
* A trans panic defense was used in 2004–2005 in California by the three defendants in the Gwen Araujo homicide case, who claimed that they were enraged by the discovery that Araujo, a transgender teenager with whom they had engaged in sex, had a penis. Following their initial suspicions about her birth-assigned sex, Araujo was &quot;subjected to forced genital exposure in the bathroom, after which it was announced that she was &#x27;really a man. The defendants claimed that Araujo&#x27;s failure to disclose her birth-assigned sex and anatomy was tantamount to deception, and that the subsequent revelation of her birth-assigned sex &quot;had provoked the violent response to what Thorman represented as a sexual violation &#x27;so deep it&#x27;s almost primal. The first trial resulted in a jury deadlock; in the second, defendants Mike Magidson and Jose Merél were convicted of second-degree murder, while the jury again deadlocked in the case of Jason Cazares. Cazares later entered a plea of no contest to charges of voluntary manslaughter. The jury did not return the requested hate crime additions to the convictions for the defendants.
* Angie Zapata was beaten to death by Allen Andrade in July 2008. After Andrade learned that Zapata had a penis, she smiled at him and said &quot;I&#x27;m all woman&quot;; his defense attorney stated the smile &quot;was a highly provoking act, and it would cause someone to have an aggressive reaction&quot; when arguing to have the charge against him dropped to second-degree murder. Judge Marcelo Kopcow rejected that argument, and Andrade was sentenced to a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole after he was convicted by a jury of first-degree murder in 2009 after two hours of deliberation. The conviction included a hate crime endorsement, believed to be the first instance of a hate crime application when the victim was transgender.
* Islan Nettles was beaten to death in Harlem just after midnight on August 17, 2013. The killer, James Dixon, was not indicted until March 2015, despite turning himself in three days after the attack and confessing that he had flown into &quot;a blind fury&quot; when he realized that Nettles was a transgender woman. Dixon pleaded not guilty to first-degree manslaughter at his indictment. Dixon was not charged with murder, which would have required proof of intent, nor was he charged with a hate crime. During his confession, Dixon said that his friends had mocked him for flirting with Nettles, not realizing that she was transgender. Furthermore, in an incident a few days prior to the beating, his friends had teased him after he flirted with two transgender women while he was doing pull-ups on a scaffolding at 138th Street and Eighth Avenue. Dixon pleaded guilty and received a sentence of 12 years&#x27; imprisonment, a sentence that Nettles&#x27; mother felt was too lenient.

<doc id="102562" wikidata="Q1052606" url="?curid=102562" title="Tabernacle Choir">
<text>The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square, formerly known as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, is an American choir affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). It has performed in the Salt Lake Tabernacle for over 100 years. Its weekly devotional program, &quot;Music &amp; the Spoken Word&quot;, is one of the longest-running radio programs in the world, having aired every week since July 15, 1929.

The choir was founded on August 22, 1847, shortly after the Mormon pioneers entered the Salt Lake Valley. Prospective singers must be LDS Church members who are eligible for a temple recommend, be between 25 and 55 years of age at the start of choir service, and live within of Temple Square.

The Tabernacle Choir is one of the most famous choirs in the world. It first performed for a U.S. president in 1911, and has performed at the inaugurations of presidents Lyndon B. Johnson (1965), Richard Nixon (1969), Ronald Reagan (1981), George H. W. Bush (1989), George W. Bush (2001), and Donald Trump (2017). 

==History==

The Tabernacle was completed in October 1867 and the choir held its first concert there on July 4, 1873.

The choir started out fairly small and rather undisciplined. On April 6, 1869, George Careless was appointed as the choir&#x27;s conductor and the Tabernacle Choir began to improve musically. Under Careless, the first large choir was assembled by adding smaller choral groups to the main Salt Lake Choir. This larger choir, just over 300, sang at the church&#x27;s October 6–8, 1873 general conference. It was at this point that the choir began to match the size of the spacious Tabernacle. On September 1, 1910, the choir sang the song &quot;Let the Mountains shout for Joy&quot; as their first ever recording. Three hundred of the 600 members showed up for the recording.

Since July 15, 1929, the choir has performed a weekly radio broadcast, &quot;Music &amp; the Spoken Word&quot;, which is one of the longer-running continuous radio network broadcasts in the world.

Later directors brought more solid vocal training and worked to raise the standards of the choir. The choir also began improving as an ensemble and increased its repertoire from around one hundred songs to nearly a thousand. On July 15, 1929, the choir performed its first radio broadcast of &quot;Music &amp; the Spoken Word&quot;. By 1950, the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square performed numerous concerts each year and had released its first long-playing recording. During the 1950s, the choir made its first tour of Europe and earned a Grammy Award for its recording of the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic.&quot;

At the end of the choir&#x27;s 4,165th live broadcast on July 12, 2009, the show&#x27;s host, Lloyd D. Newell, announced another milestone that the show had hit: the completion of its 80th year in existence. The show has been televised since the early 1960s and is now broadcast worldwide through approximately 1,500 radio and television stations.

On October 5, 2018, the choir retired the name &quot;The Mormon Tabernacle Choir&quot; and adopted the name &quot;The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square&quot; in order to align with the direction of LDS Church leadership regarding the use of terms &quot;Mormon&quot; and &quot;LDS&quot; in referencing church members. The new name retains the reference to the historic Salt Lake Tabernacle, which has been the choir&#x27;s home for over 150 years, and its location on Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Several award-winning popular artists have reflected on the beauty of the choir&#x27;s music publicly, including Bryn Terfel, Gladys Knight (of Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips), Sting (of The Police), James Taylor, Ric Ocasek (of The Cars), and The Osmonds.

The choir performs an annual Christmas concert in the Conference Center in Salt Lake City during the month of December.

The combined audience for each concert series is approximately 63,000. Tickets to the concert are free, and are available on a first-come, first-served basis. A live album (CD/DVD) is typically released, along with the concert being aired on PBS and BYUtv, during December of the following year. The concert traditionally concludes with a performance of &quot;Angels, from the Realms of Glory&quot;.

==Leadership==
The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square has about fifteen staff members including a president, directors, organists, a &quot;Music and the Spoken Word&quot; announcer, and two business-related staff members.

===Music directors===

Mack Wilberg is the current director, with associate director Ryan Murphy. Wilberg was appointed as director in March 2008, and Murphy was appointed to replace Wilberg in his former position as associate director in March 2009.

===Organists===

Richard Elliott, Andrew Unsworth, Linda Margetts, Brian Mathias, and Joseph Peeples are the current organists.

===&quot;Music and the Spoken Word&quot; announcers===

Since its inception in 1929, the &quot;spoken word&quot; segment of the program has been voiced by four separate individuals. The original writer, producer, and announcer of the spoken portion of the broadcast was Edward (Ted) Kimball, who would stand at the top of a tall ladder and announce the name of each performance piece into the microphone suspended from the Tabernacle ceiling. Kimball remained at the post for only 11 months, when he was replaced by Richard L. Evans, who continued in that capacity until his death in 1971. J. Spencer Kinard took over as announcer in 1972 until he stepped down in 1990. Lloyd D. Newell served as the announcer until mid-June 2024, and he was succeeded by Derrick Porter.

==Awards and inductions==
The choir has a number of awards, including the National Medal of Arts (2003), a Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group or Chorus (1960), and four Emmy Awards (1987, 2013, 2014). The choir is also an inductee to the American Classical Music Hall of Fame (2015) and the National Association of Broadcasters Broadcasting Hall of Fame (2004). The 320-person choir is the largest act to chart on the Billboard Hot 100—their version of &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; reached No. 13 in 1959.

<text>John Nash (18 January 1752 – 13 May 1835) was one of the foremost British architects of the Georgian and Regency eras, during which he was responsible for the design, in the neoclassical and picturesque styles, of many important areas of London. His designs were financed by the Prince Regent and by the era&#x27;s most successful property developer, James Burton. Nash also collaborated extensively with Burton&#x27;s son, Decimus Burton.

Nash&#x27;s best-known solo designs are the Royal Pavilion, Brighton; Marble Arch; and Buckingham Palace. His best-known collaboration with James Burton is Regent Street and his best-known collaborations with Decimus Burton are Regent&#x27;s Park and its terraces and Carlton House Terrace. The majority of his buildings, including those that the Burtons did not contribute to, were built by James Burton&#x27;s company.

== Background and early career ==
Nash was born in 1752, probably in Lambeth, south London. His father was a millwright also called John (1714–1772). From 1766 or 1767, Nash trained with the architect Sir Robert Taylor. The apprenticeship was completed in 1775 or 1776.

On 28 April 1775, at the now-demolished church of St Mary Newington, Nash married his first wife Jane Elizabeth Kerr, daughter of a surgeon. Initially, he seems to have pursued a career as a surveyor, builder and carpenter. This gave him an income of around £300 a year (~£49,850 in 2020 money). The couple set up home at Royal Row, Lambeth. 

He established his own architectural practice in 1777 as well as being in partnership with a timber merchant, Richard Heaviside. The couple had two children, both were baptised at St Mary-at-Lambeth, John on 9 June 1776 and Hugh on 28 April 1778. 

In June 1778, Nash, &quot;by the ill conduct of his wife found it necessary to send her into Wales in order to work a reformation on her.&quot; The cause of this appears to have been the claim that Jane Nash, &quot;had imposed two spurious children on him as his and her own, notwithstanding she had then never had any child&quot;, and she had contracted several debts unknown to her husband, including one for milliners&#x27; bills of £300. The claim that Jane had faked her pregnancies and then passed babies she had acquired off as her own was brought before the Consistory court of the Bishop of London. His wife was sent to Aberavon to lodge with Nash&#x27;s cousin, Ann Morgan, but she developed a relationship with a local man, Charles Charles. In an attempt at reconciliation, Jane returned to London in June 1779, but she continued to act extravagantly so he sent her to another cousin, Thomas Edwards of Neath. She gave birth just after Christmas and acknowledged Charles Charles as the father. In 1781, Nash instigated action against Jane for separation on grounds of adultery. The case was tried at Hereford in 1782. Charles, who was found guilty, was unable to pay the damages of £76 (~£13,200 in 2020 money) and subsequently died in prison. The divorce was finally read 26 January 1787.

His career was initially unsuccessful and short-lived. After inheriting £1000 (~£162,000 in 2020 money) in 1778 from his uncle Thomas, he invested the money in his first independent works, 15–17 Bloomsbury Square and 66–71 Great Russell Street in Bloomsbury. However, the property failed to let and he was declared bankrupt on 30 September 1783. His debts were £5000 (~£760,000 in 2020 money), including £2000 he had been lent by Robert Adam and his brothers. A blue plaque commemorating Nash was placed on 66 Great Russell Street by English Heritage in 2013.

== Wales ==

Nash left London in 1784 to live in Carmarthen, Wales, where his mother had retired (her family was from the area). In 1785, he and a local man, Samuel Simon Saxon, re-roofed the town&#x27;s church for 600 guineas. Nash and Saxon seem to have worked as building contractors and suppliers of building materials. Nash&#x27;s London buildings had been standard Georgian terraced houses. 

In Wales, he matured as an architect. His first major work in the area was the first of three prisons he would design, Carmarthen 1789–92. This was planned by the penal reformer John Howard and Nash developed this into the finished building. He went on to design the prisons at Cardigan (1791–1796) and Hereford (1792–1796). It was at Hereford that Nash met Richard Payne Knight, whose theories on the picturesque as applied to architecture and landscape would influence Nash. The commission for Hereford Gaol came after the death of William Blackburn, who was to have designed the building. Nash&#x27;s design was accepted after James Wyatt approved of the design.

In 1789, St Davids Cathedral was suffering from structural problems. Its west front was leaning forward by one foot, and Nash was hired to survey the structure and develop a plan to save the building. His solution, completed in 1791, was to demolish the upper part of the façade and rebuild it with two large but inelegant flying buttresses. In 1790, Nash met Uvedale Price, of Downtown Castle, whose theories of the Picturesque would influence Nash&#x27;s town planning. Price commissioned Nash to design Castle House Aberystwyth (1795). Its plan took the form of a right-angled triangle, with an octagonal tower at each corner, sited on the very edge of the sea.

One of Nash&#x27;s most important developments were a series of medium-sized country houses that he designed in Wales, which developed the villa designs of his teacher Sir Robert Taylor. Most of these villas consist of a roughly square plan with a small entrance hall and a staircase offset in the middle to one side, around which are placed the main rooms. There is then a less prominent servants&#x27; quarters in a wing attached to one side of the villa. The buildings are usually only two floors in height and the elevations of the main block are usually symmetrical. One of the finest of these villas is Llanerchaeron, but at least a dozen villas were designed throughout south Wales. Others, in Pembrokeshire, include Ffynone, built for the Colby family at Boncath, near Manordeifi, and Foley House, built for the lawyer Richard Foley (brother of Admiral Sir Thomas Foley) at Goat Street in Haverfordwest.
From 1796, Nash spent most of his time working in London; this was a prelude to his return to the capital in 1797. At this time, Nash designed the delicate Gothic revival gateway to Clytha Park near Abergavenny in Monmouthshire, and also his alterations in Gothic Revival style in 1794 to Hafod Uchtryd for Thomas Johnes at Devil&#x27;s Bridge, Cardiganshire. Also in c. 1794–95 he advised on the paving, lighting and water supply in Abergavenny and designed an elegant market building. Other work included Whitson Court, near Newport. After his return to London, Nash continued to design houses in Wales including Harpton Court in Radnorshire, which was demolished, apart from the service wing, in 1956. In 1807 he drew up plans for the re-building of Hawarden Castle with Gothic battlements and towers, but the plan appears to have been modified by another architect when it was carried out. In about 1808, he designed Monachty, near Aberaeron, and later drew up plans for work at Nanteos.

He met Humphry Repton at Stoke Edith in 1792 and formed a successful partnership with the landscape garden designer. One of their early commissions was at Corsham Court in 1795–96. The pair would collaborate to carefully place the Nash-designed building in grounds designed by Repton. The partnership ended in 1800 under recriminations, Repton accusing Nash of exploiting their partnership to his own advantage. As Nash developed his architectural practice, it became necessary to employ draughtsmen; the first in the early 1790s was Augustus Charles Pugin, and later in 1795, John Adey Repton, son of Humphry.

== Return to London ==

In June 1797, Nash moved into 28 Dover Street, a building of his own design. He built a larger house next door at 29, into which he moved the following year. Nash married 25-year-old Mary Anne Bradley on 17 December 1798 at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square. In 1798, he purchased a plot of land of at East Cowes on which he erected 1798–1802 East Cowes Castle as his residence. It was the first of a series of picturesque Gothic castles that he would design.

Nash&#x27;s final home in London was 14 Regent Street which he designed and built 1819–23. Number 16 was built at the same time for the home of Nash&#x27;s cousin John Edwards, a lawyer who handled all of Nash&#x27;s legal affairs. Located in lower Regent Street, near Waterloo Place, both houses formed a single design around an open courtyard. Nash&#x27;s drawing office was on the ground floor, and on the first floor was the finest room in the house, the long picture and sculpture gallery; it linked the drawing room at the front of the building with the dining room at the rear. The house was sold in 1834, and the gallery interior moved to East Cowes Castle.

The finest of the dozen country houses that Nash designed as picturesque castles include the relatively small Luscombe Castle Devon (1800–04); Ravensworth Castle (Tyne and Wear), begun in 1807 but only finally completed in 1846, which was one of the largest houses by Nash; Caerhays Castle in Cornwall (1808–10); and Shanbally Castle, County Tipperary (1818–1819), which was the last of these castles to be built. These buildings all represented Nash&#x27;s continuing development of an asymmetrical and picturesque architectural style that had begun during his years in Wales, at both Castle House Aberystwyth and his alterations to Hafod Uchtryd.

This process would be extended by Nash in planning groups of buildings, the first example being Blaise Hamlet (1810–1811). There a group of nine asymmetrical cottages was laid out around a village green. Nikolaus Pevsner described the hamlet as &quot;the &quot;ne plus ultra&quot; of the Picturesque movement&quot;. The hamlet has also been described as the first fully realized exemplar of the garden suburb. Nash developed the asymmetry of his castles in his Italianate villas. His first such exercise was Cronkhill (1802), and others included Sandridge Park (1805) and Southborough Place, Surbiton(1808).

He advised on work to the buildings of Jesus College, Oxford, in 1815, for which he required no fee but asked that the college commission a portrait of him from Sir Thomas Lawrence to hang in the college hall.

== Architect to the Prince Regent ==

Nash was a dedicated Whig and was a friend of Charles James Fox through whom Nash probably came to the attention of the Prince Regent (later King George IV). In 1806 Nash was appointed architect to the Surveyor General of Woods, Forests, Parks, and Chases. From 1810 Nash would take very few private commissions and for the rest of his career he would largely work for the Prince. His employment by the Prince Regent enabled Nash to embark upon a number of grand architectural projects.

His first major commissions in (1809–1826) from the Prince were Regent Street and the development of an area then known as Marylebone Park. With the Regent&#x27;s backing, Nash created a master plan for the area, put into effect from 1818 onwards, which stretched from St James&#x27;s northwards and included Regent Street, Regent&#x27;s Park (1809–1832) and its neighbouring streets, terraces and crescents of elegant townhouses and villas. Nash did not design all the buildings himself. In some instances, these were left in the hands of other architects such as James Pennethorne and the young Decimus Burton.

Nash went on to re-landscape St. James&#x27;s Park (1814–1827), reshaping the formal canal into the present lake, and giving the park its present form. A characteristic of Nash&#x27;s plan for Regent Street was that it followed an irregular path linking Portland Place to the north with Carlton House, London (replaced by Nash&#x27;s Carlton House Terrace (1827–1833) to the south. At the northern end of Portland Place Nash designed Park Crescent, London (1812 and 1819–1821), this opens into Nash&#x27;s Park Square, London (1823–24), this only has terraces on the east and west, the north opens into Regent&#x27;s Park.

The terraces that Nash designed around Regent&#x27;s Park though conforming to the earlier form of appearing as a single building, as developed by John Wood, the Elder, are unlike earlier examples set in gardens and are not orthogonal in their placing to each other. This was part of Nash&#x27;s development of planning, a most extreme example of this was found when he set out Park Village East and Park Village West (1823–34) to the north-east of Regent&#x27;s Park, here, a mixture of detached villas, semi-detached houses, both symmetrical and asymmetrical in their design are set out in private gardens railed off from the street, the roads loop and the buildings are both classical and gothic in style. No two buildings were the same, and or even in line with their neighbours. The park villages can be seen as the prototype for the Victorian suburbs. 
Nash was employed by the Prince from 1815 to develop his Marine Pavilion in Brighton, originally designed by Henry Holland. By 1822 Nash had finished his work on the Marine Pavilion, which was now transformed into the Royal Pavilion. The exterior was based on Mughal architecture, giving the building its exotic form, the Chinoiserie style interiors are largely the work of Frederick Crace.

Nash was also a director of the Regent&#x27;s Canal Company set up in 1812 to provide a canal link from west London to the River Thames in the east. Nash&#x27;s master plan provided for the canal to run around the northern edge of Regent&#x27;s Park; as with other projects, he left its execution to one of his assistants, in this case James Morgan. The first phase of the Regent&#x27;s Canal was completed in 1816 and finally completed in 1820.

Together with Robert Smirke and Sir John Soane, he became an official architect to the Office of Works in 1813 (although the appointment ended in 1832) at a salary of £500 per annum (£57,810 in 2020 money). Following the death in September of that year of James Wyatt, this marked the high point in his professional life. As part of Nash&#x27;s new position, he was invited to advise the Parliamentary Commissioners on the building of new churches from 1818 onwards. Nash produced ten church designs, each estimated to cost around £10,000 (£1.2 million in 2020 money) with seating capacity for 2000 people; the style of the buildings were both classical and gothic. In the end, Nash only built two churches for the Commission: the classical All Souls Church, Langham Place (1822–24), terminating the northern end of Regent Street, and the gothic St. Mary&#x27;s Haggerston (1825–27), bombed during The Blitz in 1941.
Nash was involved in the design of two of London&#x27;s theatres, both in Haymarket. The King&#x27;s Opera House (now rebuilt as Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre) (1816–1818) where he and George Repton remodelled the theatre, with arcades and shops around three sides of the building, the fourth being the still surviving Royal Opera Arcade. The other theatre was the Theatre Royal Haymarket (1821), with its fine hexastyle Corinthian order portico, which still survives, facing down Charles II Street to St. James&#x27;s Square, Nash&#x27;s interior no longer survives (the interior now dates from 1904). 

In 1820 a scandal broke, when a cartoon was published showing a half-dressed King George IV embracing Nash&#x27;s wife with a speech bubble coming from the King&#x27;s mouth containing the words &quot;I have great pleasure in visiting this part of my dominions&quot;. Whether this was based on just a rumour put about by people who resented Nash&#x27;s success or if there is substance behind is not known. Further London commissions for Nash followed, including the remodelling of Buckingham House to create Buckingham Palace (1825–1830),
and for the Royal Mews (1822–24) and Marble Arch (1828). The arch was originally designed as a triumphal arch to stand at the entrance to Buckingham Palace. It was moved when the east wing of the palace designed by Edward Blore was built, at the request of Queen Victoria whose growing family required additional domestic space. Marble Arch became the entrance to Hyde Park and the Great Exhibition.

== Work with James and Decimus Burton ==

The parents of John Nash, and Nash himself during his childhood, lived in Southwark, where James Burton worked as an &#x27;Architect and Builder&#x27; and developed a positive reputation for prescient speculative building between 1785 and 1792. Burton built the Blackfriars Rotunda in Great Surrey Street (now Blackfriars Road) to house the Leverian Museum, for land agent and museum proprietor James Parkinson. However, whereas Burton was vigorously industrious, and quickly became &#x27;most gratifyingly rich&#x27;, Nash&#x27;s early years in private practice, and his first speculative developments, which failed either to sell or let, were unsuccessful, and his consequent financial shortage was exacerbated by the &#x27;crazily extravagant&#x27; wife whom he had married before he had completed his training, until he was declared bankrupt in 1783.

To repair his finances, Nash cultivated the acquaintance of James Burton, who consented to patronize him. James Burton responsible for the social and financial patronage of the majority of Nash&#x27;s London designs, in addition to for their construction. Architectural scholar Guy Williams has written, &quot;John Nash relied on James Burton for moral and financial support in his great enterprises. Decimus had showed precocious talent as a draughtsman and as an exponent of the classical style... John Nash needed the son&#x27;s aid, as well as the father&#x27;s&quot;.

Subsequent to the Crown Estate&#x27;s refusal to finance them, James Burton agreed to personally finance the construction projects of Nash at Regent&#x27;s Park, which he had already been commissioned to construct. Consequently, in 1816, Burton purchased many of the leases of the proposed terraces around, and proposed villas within, Regent&#x27;s Park and, in 1817, Burton purchased the leases of five of the largest blocks on Regent Street. The first property to be constructed in or around Regent&#x27;s Park by Burton was his own mansion: The Holme, which was designed by his son, Decimus Burton, and completed in 1818. Burton&#x27;s extensive financial involvement &#x27;effectively guaranteed the success of the project&#x27;. In return, Nash agreed to promote the career of Decimus Burton.
Nash was a vehement advocate of the neoclassical revival endorsed by John Soane, although he had lost interest in the plain stone edifices typical of the Georgian style, and instead advocated the use of stucco. Decimus Burton entered the office of Nash in 1815, where he worked alongside Augustus Charles Pugin, who detested the neoclassical style. Burton established his own architectural practice in 1821. In 1821, Nash invited Decimus Burton to design Cornwall Terrace in Regent&#x27;s Park, and he was also invited by George Bellas Greenough, a close friend of the Prince Regent, Humphry Davy, and Nash, to design Grove House in Regent&#x27;s Park.

Greenough&#x27;s invitation to Decimus Burton was &#x27;virtually a family affair&#x27;, for Greenough had dined frequently with Decimus&#x27; parents and brothers, including the physician Henry Burton. Greenough and Decimus finalized their designs during numerous meetings at the opera. The design, when the villa had been completed, was described in &quot;The Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot; as, &quot;one of the most elegant and successful adaptations of the Grecian style to purposes of modern domestic architecture to be found in this or any country.&quot;

Subsequently, Nash invited Decimus to design Clarence Terrace, Regent&#x27;s Park. Such were Decimus Burton&#x27;s contributions to the Regent&#x27;s Park project that the Commissioners of Woods described Burton, not Nash, as &#x27;the architect of Regent&#x27;s Park&#x27;. Contrary to popular belief, the dominant architectural influence in many of the Regent&#x27;s Park projects - including Cornwall Terrace, York Terrace, Chester Terrace, Clarence Terrace, and the villas of the Inner Circle, including The Holme and the London Colosseum attraction (the latter to Thomas Hornor&#x27;s specifications) all of which were constructed by James Burton&#x27;s company - was Decimus Burton, not John Nash, who was appointed architectural &#x27;overseer&#x27; for Burton Jr.&#x27;s projects.

Decimus Burton, to Nash&#x27;s chagrin, developed the Terraces according to his own style to the extent that Nash sought, unsuccessfully, to demolish and completely rebuild Chester Terrace. Decimus subsequently eclipsed his master and emerged as the dominant force in the design of Carlton House Terrace, where he exclusively designed No. 3 and No. 4. He also designed some of the villas of the Inner Circle: his villa for the Marquess of Hertford has been described as, &#x27;decorated simplicity, such as the hand of taste, aided by the purse of wealth can alone execute&#x27;.

== Retirement and death ==
Nash&#x27;s career effectively ended with the death of George IV in 1830. The King&#x27;s notorious extravagance had generated much resentment, and Nash was now without a protector. The Treasury started to look closely at the cost of Buckingham Palace. Nash&#x27;s original estimate of the building&#x27;s cost had been £252,690, but this had risen to £496,169 in 1829; the actual cost was £613,269 (~£69.5 million in 2020 money), and the building was still unfinished. This controversy ensured that Nash would not receive any more official commissions, nor would he be awarded the knighthood that other contemporary architects such as Jeffry Wyattville, John Soane and Robert Smirke received. Nash retired to the Isle of Wight to his home, East Cowes Castle.
On 28 March 1835 Nash was described as &quot;very poorly and faint&quot;. This was the beginning of the end. On 1 May Nash&#x27;s solicitor John Wittet Lyon was summonsed to East Cowes Castle to finalise his will. By 6 May he was described as &#x27;very ill indeed all day&#x27;, he died at his home on 13 May 1835. His funeral took place at St. James&#x27;s Church, East Cowes on 20 May, where he was buried in the churchyard with a monument in the form of a stone sarcophagus. His widow acted to clear Nash&#x27;s debts (some £15,000; £1.97 million in 2020 money), she held a sale of the Castle&#x27;s contents, including three paintings by J. M. W. Turner painted on the Isle of Wight, four by Benjamin West and several copies of old master paintings by Richard Evans. These artworks were sold at Christie&#x27;s on 11 July 1835 for £1,061 (~£139,500 in 2020 money). His books, medals, drawings and engravings were bought by a bookseller named Evans for £1,423 on 15 July (~£187,078 in 2020 money). The Castle itself was sold for a reported figure of £20,000 (~£2.63 million in 2020 money) to Henry Boyle, 3rd Earl of Shannon, within the year. Nash&#x27;s widow retired to a property Nash had bequeathed to her in Hampstead where she lived until her death in 1851; she was buried with her husband on the Isle of Wight.

==Assistants and pupils==
Nash had many pupils and assistants, including Decimus Burton; Humphry Repton&#x27;s sons, John Adey Repton and George Stanley Repton; Anthony Salvin; John Foulon (1772–1842); Augustus Charles Pugin; F.H. Greenway; James Morgan; James Pennethorne; and the brothers Henry, James, and George Pain.

<doc id="102567" wikidata="Q128736" url="?curid=102567" title="John Forbes Nash Jr.">
<text>John Forbes Nash Jr. (June 13, 1928 – May 23, 2015), known and published as John Nash, was an American mathematician who made fundamental contributions to game theory, real algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and partial differential equations. Nash and fellow game theorists John Harsanyi and Reinhard Selten were awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize in Economics. In 2015, he and Louis Nirenberg were awarded the Abel Prize for their contributions to the field of partial differential equations.

As a graduate student in the Princeton University Department of Mathematics, Nash introduced a number of concepts (including Nash equilibrium and the Nash bargaining solution) which are now considered central to game theory and its applications in various sciences. In the 1950s, Nash discovered and proved the Nash embedding theorems by solving a system of nonlinear partial differential equations arising in Riemannian geometry. This work, also introducing a preliminary form of the Nash–Moser theorem, was later recognized by the American Mathematical Society with the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research. Ennio De Giorgi and Nash found, with separate methods, a body of results paving the way for a systematic understanding of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations. Their De Giorgi–Nash theorem on the smoothness of solutions of such equations resolved Hilbert&#x27;s nineteenth problem on regularity in the calculus of variations, which had been a well-known open problem for almost sixty years.

In 1959, Nash began showing clear signs of mental illness, and spent several years at psychiatric hospitals being treated for schizophrenia. After 1970, his condition slowly improved, allowing him to return to academic work by the mid-1980s. 

Nash&#x27;s life was the subject of Sylvia Nasar&#x27;s 1998 biographical book &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, and his struggles with his illness and his recovery became the basis for a film of the same name directed by Ron Howard, in which Nash was portrayed by Russell Crowe.

== Early life and education ==
John Forbes Nash Jr. was born on June 13, 1928, in Bluefield, West Virginia. His father and namesake, John Forbes Nash Sr., was an electrical engineer for the Appalachian Electric Power Company. His mother, Margaret Virginia (née Martin) Nash, had been a schoolteacher before she was married. He was baptized in the Episcopal Church. He had a younger sister, Martha (born November 16, 1930).

Nash attended kindergarten and public school, and he learned from books provided by his parents and grandparents. Nash&#x27;s parents pursued opportunities to supplement their son&#x27;s education, and arranged for him to take advanced mathematics courses at nearby Bluefield College (now Bluefield University) during his final year of high school. He attended Carnegie Institute of Technology (which later became Carnegie Mellon University) through a full benefit of the George Westinghouse Scholarship, initially majoring in chemical engineering. He switched to a chemistry major and eventually, at the advice of his teacher John Lighton Synge, to mathematics. After graduating in 1948, with both a B.S. and M.S. in mathematics, Nash accepted a fellowship to Princeton University, where he pursued further graduate studies in mathematics and sciences.

Nash&#x27;s adviser and former Carnegie professor Richard Duffin wrote a letter of recommendation for Nash&#x27;s entrance to Princeton stating, &quot;He is a mathematical genius.&quot; Nash was also accepted at Harvard University, along with the University of Chicago and the University of Michigan. However, the chairman of the mathematics department at Princeton, Solomon Lefschetz, offered him the John S. Kennedy fellowship, convincing Nash that Princeton valued him more. Further, he considered Princeton more favorably because of its proximity to his family in Bluefield. At Princeton, he began work on his equilibrium theory, later known as the Nash equilibrium.

== Research contributions ==
Nash did not publish extensively, although many of his papers are considered landmarks in their fields. As a graduate student at Princeton, he made foundational contributions to game theory and real algebraic geometry. As a postdoctoral fellow at MIT, Nash turned to differential geometry. Although the results of Nash&#x27;s work on differential geometry are phrased in a geometrical language, the work is almost entirely to do with the mathematical analysis of partial differential equations. After proving his two isometric embedding theorems, Nash turned to research dealing directly with partial differential equations, where he discovered and proved the De Giorgi–Nash theorem, thereby resolving one form of Hilbert&#x27;s nineteenth problem.

In 2011, the National Security Agency declassified letters written by Nash in the 1950s, in which he had proposed a new encryption–decryption machine. The letters show that Nash had anticipated many concepts of modern cryptography, which are based on computational hardness.

=== Game theory ===
Nash earned a PhD in 1950 with a 28-page dissertation on non-cooperative games. The thesis, written under the supervision of doctoral advisor Albert W. Tucker, contained the definition and properties of the Nash equilibrium, a crucial concept in non-cooperative games. A version of his thesis was published a year later in the Annals of Mathematics. In the early 1950s, Nash carried out research on a number of related concepts in game theory, including the theory of cooperative games. For his work, Nash was one of the recipients of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994.

=== Real algebraic geometry ===
In 1949, while still a graduate student, Nash found a new result in the mathematical field of real algebraic geometry. He announced his theorem in a contributed paper at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1950, although he had not yet worked out the details of its proof. Nash&#x27;s theorem was finalized by October 1951, when Nash submitted his work to the Annals of Mathematics. It had been well-known since the 1930s that every closed smooth manifold is diffeomorphic to the zero set of some collection of smooth functions on Euclidean space. In his work, Nash proved that those smooth functions can be taken to be polynomials. This was widely regarded as a surprising result, since the class of smooth functions and smooth manifolds is usually far more flexible than the class of polynomials. Nash&#x27;s proof introduced the concepts now known as Nash function and Nash manifold, which have since been widely studied in real algebraic geometry. Nash&#x27;s theorem itself was famously applied by Michael Artin and Barry Mazur to the study of dynamical systems, by combining Nash&#x27;s polynomial approximation together with Bézout&#x27;s theorem.

===Differential geometry===
During his postdoctoral position at MIT, Nash was eager to find high-profile mathematical problems to study. From Warren Ambrose, a differential geometer, he learned about the conjecture that any Riemannian manifold is isometric to a submanifold of Euclidean space. Nash&#x27;s results proving the conjecture are now known as the Nash embedding theorems, the second of which Mikhael Gromov has called &quot;one of the main achievements of mathematics of the twentieth century&quot;.

Nash&#x27;s first embedding theorem was found in 1953. He found that any Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded in a Euclidean space by a continuously differentiable mapping. Nash&#x27;s construction allows the codimension of the embedding to be very small, with the effect that in many cases it is logically impossible that a highly-differentiable isometric embedding exists. (Based on Nash&#x27;s techniques, Nicolaas Kuiper soon found even smaller codimensions, with the improved result often known as the &quot;Nash–Kuiper theorem&quot;.) As such, Nash&#x27;s embeddings are limited to the setting of low differentiability. For this reason, Nash&#x27;s result is somewhat outside the mainstream in the field of differential geometry, where high differentiability is significant in much of the usual analysis.

However, the logic of Nash&#x27;s work has been found to be useful in many other contexts in mathematical analysis. Starting with work of Camillo De Lellis and László Székelyhidi, the ideas of Nash&#x27;s proof were applied for various constructions of turbulent solutions of the Euler equations in fluid mechanics. In the 1970s, Mikhael Gromov developed Nash&#x27;s ideas into the general framework of &quot;convex integration&quot;, which has been (among other uses) applied by Stefan Müller and Vladimír Šverák to construct counterexamples to generalized forms of Hilbert&#x27;s nineteenth problem in the calculus of variations.

Nash found the construction of smoothly differentiable isometric embeddings to be unexpectedly difficult. However, after around a year and a half of intensive work, his efforts succeeded, thereby proving the second Nash embedding theorem. The ideas involved in proving this second theorem are largely separate from those used in proving the first. The fundamental aspect of the proof is an implicit function theorem for isometric embeddings. The usual formulations of the implicit function theorem are inapplicable, for technical reasons related to the &quot;loss of regularity&quot; phenomena. Nash&#x27;s resolution of this issue, given by deforming an isometric embedding by an ordinary differential equation along which extra regularity is continually injected, is regarded as a fundamentally novel technique in mathematical analysis. Nash&#x27;s paper was awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research in 1999, where his &quot;most original idea&quot; in the resolution of the &quot;loss of regularity&quot; issue was cited as &quot;one of the great achievements in mathematical analysis in this century&quot;. According to Gromov:
Due to Jürgen Moser&#x27;s extension of Nash&#x27;s ideas for application to other problems (notably in celestial mechanics), the resulting implicit function theorem is known as the Nash–Moser theorem. It has been extended and generalized by a number of other authors, among them Gromov, Richard Hamilton, Lars Hörmander, Jacob Schwartz, and Eduard Zehnder. Nash himself analyzed the problem in the context of analytic functions. Schwartz later commented that Nash&#x27;s ideas were &quot;not just novel, but very mysterious,&quot; and that it was very hard to &quot;get to the bottom of it.&quot; According to Gromov:
===Partial differential equations===
While spending time at the Courant Institute in New York City, Louis Nirenberg informed Nash of a well-known conjecture in the field of elliptic partial differential equations. In 1938, Charles Morrey had proved a fundamental elliptic regularity result for functions of two independent variables, but analogous results for functions of more than two variables had proved elusive. After extensive discussions with Nirenberg and Lars Hörmander, Nash was able to extend Morrey&#x27;s results, not only to functions of more than two variables, but also to the context of parabolic partial differential equations. In his work, as in Morrey&#x27;s, uniform control over the continuity of the solutions to such equations is achieved, without assuming any level of differentiability on the coefficients of the equation. The Nash inequality was a particular result found in the course of his work (the proof of which Nash attributed to Elias Stein), which has been found useful in other contexts.

Soon after, Nash learned from Paul Garabedian, recently returned from Italy, that the then-unknown Ennio De Giorgi had found nearly identical results for elliptic partial differential equations. De Giorgi and Nash&#x27;s methods had little to do with one another, although Nash&#x27;s were somewhat more powerful in applying to both elliptic and parabolic equations. A few years later, inspired by De Giorgi&#x27;s method, Jürgen Moser found a different approach to the same results, and the resulting body of work is now known as the De Giorgi–Nash theorem or the De Giorgi–Nash–Moser theory (which is distinct from the Nash–Moser theorem). De Giorgi and Moser&#x27;s methods became particularly influential over the next several years, through their developments in the works of Olga Ladyzhenskaya, James Serrin, and Neil Trudinger, among others. Their work, based primarily on the judicious choice of test functions in the weak formulation of partial differential equations, is in strong contrast to Nash&#x27;s work, which is based on analysis of the heat kernel. Nash&#x27;s approach to the De Giorgi–Nash theory was later revisited by Eugene Fabes and Daniel Stroock, initiating the re-derivation and extension of the results originally obtained from De Giorgi and Moser&#x27;s techniques.

From the fact that minimizers to many functionals in the calculus of variations solve elliptic partial differential equations, Hilbert&#x27;s nineteenth problem (on the smoothness of these minimizers), conjectured almost sixty years prior, was directly amenable to the De Giorgi–Nash theory. Nash received instant recognition for his work, with Peter Lax describing it as a &quot;stroke of genius&quot;. Nash would later speculate that had it not been for De Giorgi&#x27;s simultaneous discovery, he would have been a recipient of the prestigious Fields Medal in 1958. Although the medal committee&#x27;s reasoning is not fully known, and was not purely based on questions of mathematical merit, archival research has shown that Nash placed third in the committee&#x27;s vote for the medal, after the two mathematicians (Klaus Roth and René Thom) who were awarded the medal that year.

== Mental illness ==
Although Nash&#x27;s mental illness first began to manifest in the form of paranoia, his wife later described his behavior as erratic. Nash thought that all men who wore red ties were part of a communist conspiracy against him. He mailed letters to embassies in Washington, D.C., declaring that they were establishing a government. Nash&#x27;s psychological issues crossed into his professional life when he gave an American Mathematical Society lecture at Columbia University in early 1959. Originally intended to present proof of the Riemann hypothesis, the lecture was incomprehensible. Colleagues in the audience immediately realized that something was wrong.

In April 1959, Nash was admitted to McLean Hospital for one month. Based on his paranoid, persecutory delusions, hallucinations, and increasing asociality, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. In 1961, Nash was admitted to the New Jersey State Hospital at Trenton. Over the next nine years, he spent intervals of time in psychiatric hospitals, where he received both antipsychotic medications and insulin shock therapy.

Although he sometimes took prescribed medication, Nash later wrote that he did so only under pressure. According to Nash, the film &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; inaccurately implied he was taking atypical antipsychotics. He attributed the depiction to the screenwriter who was worried about the film encouraging people with mental illness to stop taking their medication.

Nash did not take any medication after 1970, nor was he committed to a hospital ever again. Nash recovered gradually. Encouraged by his then former wife, Lardé, Nash lived at home and spent his time in the Princeton mathematics department where his eccentricities were accepted even when his mental condition was poor. Lardé credits his recovery to maintaining &quot;a quiet life&quot; with social support.

Nash dated the start of what he termed &quot;mental disturbances&quot; to the early months of 1959, when his wife was pregnant. He described a process of change &quot;from scientific rationality of thinking into the delusional thinking characteristic of persons who are psychiatrically diagnosed as &#x27;schizophrenic&#x27; or &#x27;paranoid schizophrenic. For Nash, this included seeing himself as a messenger or having a special function of some kind, of having supporters and opponents and hidden schemers, along with a feeling of being persecuted and searching for signs representing divine revelation. During his psychotic phase, Nash also referred to himself in the third person as &quot;Johann von Nassau&quot;. Nash suggested his delusional thinking was related to his unhappiness, his desire to be recognized, and his characteristic way of thinking, saying, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have had good scientific ideas if I had thought more normally.&quot; He also said, &quot;If I felt completely pressureless I don&#x27;t think I would have gone in this pattern&quot;.

Nash reported that he started hearing voices in 1964, then later engaged in a process of consciously rejecting them. He only renounced his &quot;dream-like delusional hypotheses&quot; after a prolonged period of involuntary commitment in mental hospitals—&quot;enforced rationality&quot;. Upon doing so, he was temporarily able to return to productive work as a mathematician. By the late 1960s, he relapsed. Eventually, he &quot;intellectually rejected&quot; his &quot; influenced&quot; and &quot;politically oriented&quot; thinking as a waste of effort. In 1995, he said that he did not realize his full potential due to nearly 30 years of mental illness.

Nash wrote in 1994:
== Recognition and later career ==

In 1978, Nash was awarded the John von Neumann Theory Prize for his discovery of non-cooperative equilibria, now called Nash Equilibria. He won the Leroy P. Steele Prize in 1999.

In 1994, he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (along with John Harsanyi and Reinhard Selten) for his game theory work as a Princeton graduate student. In the late 1980s, Nash had begun to use email to gradually link with working mathematicians who realized that he was John Nash and that his new work had value. They formed part of the nucleus of a group that contacted the Bank of Sweden&#x27;s Nobel award committee and were able to vouch for Nash&#x27;s mental health and ability to receive the award.

Nash&#x27;s later work involved ventures in advanced game theory, including partial agency, which show that, as in his early career, he preferred to select his own path and problems. Between 1945 and 1996, he published 23 scientific papers.

Nash has suggested hypotheses on mental illness. He has compared not thinking in an acceptable manner, or being &quot;insane&quot; and not fitting into a usual social function, to being &quot;on strike&quot; from an economic point of view. He advanced views in evolutionary psychology about the potential benefits of apparently nonstandard behaviors or roles.

Nash criticized Keynesian ideas of monetary economics which allowed for a central bank to implement monetary policies. He proposed a standard of &quot;Ideal Money&quot; pegged to an &quot;industrial consumption price index&quot; which was more stable than &quot;bad money.&quot; He noted that his thinking on money and the function of monetary authority paralleled that of economist Friedrich Hayek.

Nash received an honorary degree, Doctor of Science and Technology, from Carnegie Mellon University in 1999, an honorary degree in economics from the University of Naples Federico II in 2003, an honorary doctorate in economics from the University of Antwerp in 2007, an honorary doctorate of science from the City University of Hong Kong in 2011, and was keynote speaker at a conference on game theory. Nash also received honorary doctorates from two West Virginia colleges: the University of Charleston in 2003 and West Virginia University Tech in 2006. He was a prolific guest speaker at a number of events, such as the Warwick Economics Summit in 2005, at the University of Warwick.

Nash was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2006 and became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2012.

On May 19, 2015, a few days before his death, Nash, along with Louis Nirenberg, was awarded the 2015 Abel Prize by King Harald V of Norway at a ceremony in Oslo.

== Personal life ==
In 1951, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) hired Nash as a C. L. E. Moore instructor in the mathematics faculty. About a year later, Nash began a relationship with Eleanor Stier, a nurse he met while admitted as a patient. They had a son, John David Stier, but Nash left Stier when she told him of her pregnancy. The film based on Nash&#x27;s life, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, was criticized during the run-up to the 2002 Oscars for omitting this aspect of his life. He was said to have abandoned her based on her social status, which he thought to have been beneath his.

In Santa Monica, California, in 1954, while in his twenties, Nash was arrested for indecent exposure in a sting operation targeting gay men. Although the charges were dropped, he was stripped of his top-secret security clearance and fired from RAND Corporation, where he had worked as a consultant.

Not long after breaking up with Stier, Nash met Alicia Lardé Lopez-Harrison, a naturalized U.S. citizen from El Salvador. Lardé was a graduate of MIT with a major in physics. They married in February 1957. Although Nash was an atheist, the ceremony was performed in an Episcopal church. In 1958, Nash was appointed to a tenured position at MIT, and his first signs of mental illness soon became evident. He resigned his position at MIT in the spring of 1959. His son, John Charles Martin Nash, was born a few months later. The child was not named for a year because Alicia felt that Nash should have a say in choosing the name. Due to the stress of dealing with his illness, Nash and Lardé divorced in 1963. After his final hospital discharge in 1970, Nash lived in Lardé&#x27;s house as a boarder. This stability seemed to help him, and he learned how to consciously discard his paranoid delusions. Princeton allowed him to audit classes. He continued to work on mathematics and was eventually allowed to teach again. In the 1990s, Lardé and Nash resumed their relationship, remarrying in 2001. John Charles Martin Nash earned a PhD in mathematics from Rutgers University and was diagnosed with schizophrenia as an adult.

== Death ==
On May 23, 2015, Nash and his wife died in a car accident on the New Jersey Turnpike in Monroe Township, New Jersey while returning home from receiving the Abel Prize in Norway. The driver of the taxicab they were riding in from Newark Airport lost control of the cab and struck a guardrail. Because neither were wearing seatbelts, both passengers were ejected and killed. At the time of his death, Nash was a longtime resident of New Jersey. He was survived by two sons, John Charles Martin Nash, who lived with his parents at the time of their death, and elder child John Stier.

Following his death, obituaries appeared in scientific and popular media throughout the world. In addition to their obituary for Nash, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article containing quotes from Nash that had been assembled from media and other published sources. The quotes consisted of Nash&#x27;s reflections on his life and achievements.

== Legacy ==
At Princeton in the 1970s, Nash became known as &quot;The Phantom of Fine Hall&quot; (Princeton&#x27;s mathematics center), a shadowy figure who would scribble arcane equations on blackboards in the middle of the night.

He is referred to in a novel set at Princeton, &quot;The Mind-Body Problem&quot;, 1983, by Rebecca Goldstein.

Sylvia Nasar&#x27;s biography of Nash, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, was published in 1998. A film by the same name was released in 2001, directed by Ron Howard with Russell Crowe playing Nash; it won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. For his performance as Nash, Crowe won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama at the 59th Golden Globe Awards and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor at the 55th British Academy Film Awards. Crowe was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 74th Academy Awards; Denzel Washington won for his performance in &quot;Training Day&quot;.

<text>A personal trainer is an individual who creates and delivers safe and effective exercise programs for healthy individuals and groups, or those with medical clearance to exercise. They motivate clients by collaborating to set goals, providing meaningful feedback, and by being a reliable source for accountability. Trainers also conduct a variety of assessments beginning with a preparticipation health-screening and may also include assessments of posture and movement, flexibility, balance, core function, cardio-respiratory fitness, muscular fitness, body composition, and skill-related parameters (e.g. power, agility, coordination, speed, and reactivity) to observe and gather relevant information needed to develop an effective exercise program and support client goal attainment.

These assessments may be performed at the beginning of and after an exercise program to measure client progress toward improved physical fitness. Trainers create exercise programs following a progression model, using the baseline assessment as the starting point of a client&#x27;s physical abilities and framing the program to fit the individual personally. They also provide education on many other aspects of wellness, including general health and nutrition guidelines. Helping clients to reach their full potential in various aspects of life requires a comprehensive client-centered approach along with a belief that clients are resourceful and capable of change.

Qualified personal trainers or certified personal trainers (CPTs) recognize their own areas of expertise. If a trainer suspects that one of their clients has a medical condition that could prevent the client from safe participation in an exercise program, they must refer the client to the proper health professional for medical clearance.

== Purpose of personal training ==
 The scope of practice for a personal trainer has a primary focus on prevention and involves enhancing components of health and fitness for the general, healthy population or those cleared for exercise.
Proper exercise prescription may result in improved body composition, physical performance, heart condition, and health outcomes. The decision to hire a personal trainer may be related to a perceived health threat, a lack of knowledge, a personal belief in one&#x27;s ability to begin and adhere to an exercise program, or some sort of psychological effect. Often clients will seek the guidance of a personal trainer for factors related to motivation and adherence. A personal trainer pays close attention to the client&#x27;s exercise technique, workout routine, goals, values, and nutrition. Personal training in men and women has been shown to improve the benefit-to-concern ratio for exercise (decisional balance), and increase confidence to choose exercise in the face of other time demands (scheduling self-efficacy). Personal training results in higher strength, higher workout intensities, and higher perceived exertion during exercise.

== Employment characteristics ==

The profession is generally not restricted by the venue, and personal trainers may work in fitness facilities, in their own homes, in client homes, over live video (also called &quot;virtual personal trainers&quot;), or outdoors. Almost all exercise professionals work in physical fitness facilities, health clubs, and fitness centers located in the amusement and recreation industry or in civic and social organizations. Personal training is not regulated in any jurisdiction in the United States except for Washington D.C. which adopted registration requirements for personal fitness trainers in February 2014. Some employers, such as gyms, require personal trainers to be certified. However, this is not always the case and some personal trainers can find work without certification. Overall, personal trainers must possess certain skills, such as a passion for fitness and helping others achieve their goals, industry knowledge, leadership, and the ability to communicate effectively with their clients.

Personal trainers may specialize in a certain training type, training philosophy, performance type, exercise modality, or client population. In general, most personal trainers develop exercise plans for aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and/or flexibility training. With aerobic exercise prescription, personal trainers determine the type of exercise, duration of exercise, and frequency of exercise. For resistance exercise prescription, the type of exercise, total session volume, rest period, frequency, and intensity are determined. Personal trainers may also be involved in the prescription of stretching routines or other approaches. Personal trainers help clients to perform exercises with correct techniques, minimizing the risk of injury. While some discuss nutrition, ergogenic supplementation, and spiritual practices with clients, there is debate within the industry as to whether it fits within their scope of practice and training qualifications.

==Accreditation==

Personal trainer accreditation is a process that provides certification of competency. Qualification standards for personal trainers vary between countries. Personal trainer accreditation is also viewed as experience in the field with many client testimonials on their achievements working with their personal trainer.

===International===
The International Confederation of Registers for Exercise Professionals (ICREPs) is an international partnership between registration bodies around the world that register exercise professionals. Member countries conform to the international standards set by ICREPs for personal training (and other exercise education credentials) and are transferable to other member countries. The current members of ICREPs (as of 2019) are: Fitness Australia, NFLA Canada, REPs India, REPs Ireland, REPs New Zealand, REPs Poland, REPs South Africa, REPs United Arab Emirates, USREPs, and IranREPs.

===Australia===
In Australia, personal trainers may work independently with suitable insurance or choose to be a member of a registering body (Fitness Australia or Physical Activity Australia). The qualifications levels include; Level 1 - Certificate III in Fitness, Level 2 - Certificate IV in Fitness and Level 3 - Diploma of Fitness. These can be obtained from nationally accredited colleges (TAFE, Australian College of Sport &amp; Fitness, Fitness Industry Training, Global Fitness Institute, Australian Institute of Fitness, Australian Fitness Academy). Once working in the industry, trainers who are members of associations are also required to complete short courses to obtain continuing education credit (CEC) points they need to keep their registration. A minimum of 20 CEC points every two years is required. Many personal trainers also have additional qualifications in weight loss, strength training, kid&#x27;s fitness, and nutrition, which is in part due to the CEC program. CEC courses can cover a wide variety of topics such as different training techniques, nutrition, exercise styles, health conditions, physiology, lifestyle, and rehabilitation.

Once members obtain their Australian Cert III &amp; IV in Fitness, they can practice nationally. This can be done with this certification and using the Global Portability Matrix. The Global Portability Matrix was designed by ICREPS. This stands for International Confederation of Registers for Exercise Professionals, which allows all members to practice in other countries. Members can train in Belgium, The Netherlands, Hungary, The United Kingdom, Ireland, Lebanon, Poland, The United States, The Caribbean, South Africa, United Arab Emirates, Canada, and New Zealand.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, personal trainers must have a bachelor&#x27;s degree in &quot;Physical Education&quot; (a degree that combines knowledge in the fields of Exercise Science and Healthcare science) and be registered with the Conselho Federal de Educação Física (Federal Council of Physical Education), and risk criminal charges if they operate without these two requirements.

===Canada===
In Canada, the main certifying bodies are Canadian Fitness Education Services (CFES), Canadian Fitness Professionals (CanFit Pro), Certified Personal Trainers Network, the Canadian Society of Exercise Physiology (CSEP), and the National Fitness Leadership Association (NFLA). CSEP requires a diploma or degree in the exercise field, most other organizations require experience and/or workshops to qualify for a credential. Many personal trainers receive a CFES, CanFit Pro, NFLA or an NCCA accredited certification, but there are no certifications required by law. Fitness instruction in Canada is an unregulated industry.

===Iran===
In Iran, the main certifying bodies are IranREPs and Bodybuilding Federation which these two organizations signed a memorandum of understanding in the beginning of 2019. IranREPs requires a diploma or degree in the exercise field from EuropeActive accredited providers or Sport universities.
IranREPs joined the ICREPs in 2020.

=== Europe ===
In Europe, personal trainers may work independently, but will always need accreditation by one of the main certifying bodies such as:

EREPS: The European Register of Exercise Professionals (EREPS) is an independent process for the registering of instructors, trainers and teachers working in the European health, fitness and physical activity sector. It is a pan-European system, based on independent national registers, which culminate in a central European database.

=== New Zealand ===
New Zealand has one major registration body for exercise professionals – REPs New Zealand. REPs New Zealand is recognised by both Exercise New Zealand (the industry association) and ICREPs.

REPs NZ currently have three major registration categories

&quot;1: Exercise Prescription&quot;

&quot;2: Group Exercise&quot;

&quot;3: Yoga Teacher&quot;

To be eligible to register for REPs you need to have one the below options 

&quot;a) Completed an initial qualification from a REPs registered Provider&quot;

&quot;b) Complete a NZ University Degree with an Exercise focus&quot;

&quot;c) Hold a NZ Certificate in Exercise 4&quot;

&quot;d) Hold current registration with an ICREPs partner&quot;

To maintain your REPs registration you will need to 

&quot;a) Renew your registration yearly&quot;

&quot;b) Keep your CPR and First Aid up to date and valid&quot;

&quot;c) Complete 10CPD points per year&quot;

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, there are several ways to achieve a personal training qualification. Most personal training qualifications are accredited through awarding bodies like Active IQ, Focus Awards, YMCA Awards, VTCT and City and Guilds. These qualifications are generally delivered by Further Education (FE) establishments like colleges, or by private training providers. Upon successful completion of an accredited awarding body qualification, candidates become eligible for CIMSPA Practitioner status.

There is no legal restriction on the title of Personal Trainer nor any formal body associated with regulating Personal Training.

===United States===
A number of certifications are available in the U.S., although a number are not accredited. Most require a high school diploma, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) certification, and some type of examination.

The United States Registry of Exercise Professionals (USREPS) is the official registry of exercise professionals in the United States and provides clients, employers, healthcare practitioners, policymakers, and insurance providers a single source for finding well-qualified exercise professionals or to verify credentials.

In the United States, various certifications are available within the fitness industry, although not all are accredited. Most certifications typically require a high school diploma, CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), AED (automated external defibrillator) certification, and may involve an examination process.

A 2002 investigation evaluated a random sample of 115 personal trainers using the Fitness Instructors Knowledge Assessment (FIKA) (which measures knowledge in nutrition, health screening, testing protocols, exercise prescription, and special populations). The study described that:
* 70% of those surveyed did not have a degree in any field related to exercise science.
* Those who did not have a bachelor&#x27;s degree in an exercise science-related field scored 31% less on average than those with a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher in the field.
* Those holding one of two specific certifications (the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) or the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) certification) scored 83% of the questions correctly on average. Those holding any certification other than ACSM or NSCA answered only 38% of the questions correctly.
* Years of experience was not found to be predictive of personal trainer knowledge.

In partnership with the fitness industry, the International Health, Racquet &amp; Sportsclub Association (IHRSA), which represents over 9,000 health and fitness facilities, started an initiative in 2002 to improve standards for both its own clubs and the industry as a whole. In January 2006, IHRSA implemented a recommendation that its facilities only accept personal trainers with certifications recognized by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) if recognized either by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) and/or the U.S. Department of Education (USDE). As a result, the Distance Education Accrediting Commission (DEAC) was recognized by IHRSA as a recognized accreditor of fitness professional certification organizations. Since then, the DEAC has accredited several personal trainer certification organizations, including the Athletics and Fitness Association of America (AFAA) and the International Sports Sciences Association (ISSA) among others. As of now, NASM, ISSA, AFAA, ACSM, ACE, and NSCA certifications are among the 16 accredited certifications recognized by IHRSA, three of which are accredited by the Distance Education Accrediting Commission (DEAC).

Various organizations within the profession have lobbied for the adoption of more stringent criteria for certification developed by the NSF International. There remains no national legal restriction on the industry to date except for the District of Columbia (D.C.) which as of February 2014, passed legislation requiring personal fitness trainers to register in that jurisdiction.

===India===
Personal Trainers in India must hold an appropriate Certification in Personal Training from respected organizations such as Active IQ, National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM), National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA), National Exercise and Sports Trainer Association (NESTA), National Council on Strength and Fitness (NCSF) and The International Sports Sciences Association(ISSA).
Apart from all these International certifications, if one holds any National Skill Qualification Framework Certifications (NSQF Certificates) such as Level 4 Fitness Trainer, Level 5 Personal Fitness Trainer, Level 6 Strength and Conditioning and Diploma in Personal Training from REPS India, will also provide an opportunity to work as a personal trainer in India. Any additional continuing educational courses such as Corrective Exercise Specialist, Special Population Trainer, Weight loss Specialist, Reebok Crossfit, LesMills Bodypump and Yoga Trainer will yield an individual further benefits of salary escalation.
To work in India, Personal trainers do not have to register as an Exercise Professional to get employment.

<text>Robert Bresson (; 25 September 1901 – 18 December 1999) was a French film director. Known for his ascetic approach, Bresson made a notable contribution to the art of cinema; his non-professional actors, ellipses, and sparse use of scoring have led his works to be regarded as preeminent examples of minimalist film. Much of his work is known for being tragic in story and nature.

Bresson is among the most highly regarded filmmakers of all time. He has the highest number of films (seven) that made the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll of the 250 greatest films ever made. His works &quot;A Man Escaped&quot; (1956), &quot;Pickpocket&quot; (1959) and &quot;Au hasard Balthazar&quot; (1966) were ranked among the top 100, and other films like &quot;Mouchette&quot; (1967) and (1983) also received many votes. Jean-Luc Godard once wrote, &quot;He is the French cinema, as Dostoevsky is the Russian novel and Mozart is German music.&quot;

==Personal life==
Bresson was born at Bromont-Lamothe, Puy-de-Dôme, the son of Marie-Élisabeth (née Clausels) and Léon Bresson. Little is known of his early life. He was educated at Lycée Lakanal in Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine, close to Paris, and turned to painting after graduating. Three formative influences in his early life are evident in his films: Catholicism, art, and his experiences as a prisoner of war. Robert Bresson lived in Paris, France, in the Île Saint-Louis.

Initially a photographer, Bresson made his first short film, &quot;Les affaires publiques&quot; (&quot;Public Affairs&quot;) in 1934. He enlisted in the French Army on the onset of World War II and was captured by the Germans in 1940 and held as a prisoner of war for more than a year; an experience which informed &quot;A Man Escaped&quot;. In a career that spanned fifty years, Bresson made only 13 feature-length films. This reflects his painstaking approach to the filmmaking process and his non-commercial preoccupations. Difficulty finding funding for his projects was also a factor.

Bresson was sometimes accused of an uncompromising &quot;ivory tower existence&quot; outside of mainstream cinema. Later in his life, he said that he had stopped watching other filmmakers&#x27; movies in theaters, although he later praised the James Bond film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981), saying that &quot;It filled me with wonder ... if I could have seen it twice in a row and again the next day, I would have.&quot; Critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, an admirer of Bresson&#x27;s work, argued that the filmmaker was &quot;a mysterious, aloof figure&quot;, and wrote that on the set of &quot;Four Nights of a Dreamer&quot; (1971), where Rosenbaum was an extra, the director &quot;seemed more isolated from his crew than any other filmmaker I&#x27;ve seen at work; his widow and onetime assistant director, Mylene van der Mersch, often conveyed his instructions.&quot;

Bresson died on 18 December 1999, at his home in Droue-sur-Drouette, southwest of Paris. He was 98. He made his last film, , in 1983 and had been unwell for some time.

==Themes and style==

=== Artistic minimalism ===
Bresson published &quot;Notes on the Cinematographer&quot; in 1975, in which he argues for a unique sense of the term &quot;cinematography&quot;. For him, cinematography is the higher function of cinema. While a movie is in essence &quot;only&quot; filmed theatre, Bresson defines cinematography as an attempt to create a new language of moving images and sounds. His early artistic focus was to separate the language of cinema from that of the theater, which often relies heavily upon the actor&#x27;s performance to drive the work. Film scholar Tony Pipolo writes that &quot;Bresson opposed not just professional actors, but acting itself,&quot; preferring to think of his actors as &#x27;models&#x27;. In &quot;Notes on the Cinematographer&quot; (; also published in English as &quot;Notes on the Cinematograph&quot;), a collection of aphorisms written by Bresson, the director succinctly defines the difference between the two:

HUMAN MODELS: movement from the exterior to the interior. [...]
ACTORS: movement from the interior to the exterior.

Bresson further elaborates on his disdain for acting by appropriating a remark Chateaubriand had made about 19th century poets and applying it to actors: &quot;what they lack is not naturalness, but Nature.&quot; For Bresson, &quot;to think it&#x27;s more natural for a movement to be made or a phrase to be said like &quot;this&quot; than like &quot;that&quot;&quot; is &quot;absurd&quot;, and &quot;nothing rings more false in film [...] than the overstudied sentiments&quot; of theater.

With his &#x27;model&#x27; technique, Bresson&#x27;s actors were required to repeat multiple takes of each scene until all semblances of &#x27;performance&#x27; were stripped away, leaving a stark effect that registers as both subtle and raw. This, as well as Bresson&#x27;s restraint in musical scoring, would have a significant influence on minimalist cinema. In the academic journal &quot;CrossCurrents&quot;, Shmuel Ben-gad wrote:

There is a credibility in Bresson&#x27;s models: They are like people we meet in life, more or less opaque creatures who speak, move, and gesture [...] Acting, on the other hand, no matter how naturalistic, actively deforms or invents by putting an overlay or filter over the person, presenting a simplification of a human being and not allowing the camera to capture the actor&#x27;s human depths. Thus what Bresson sees as the essence of filmic art, the achievement of the creative transformation involved in all art through the interplay of images of real things, is destroyed by the artifice of acting. For Bresson, then, acting is, like mood music and expressive camera work, just one more way of deforming reality or inventing that has to be avoided.
Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that Bresson&#x27;s directorial style resulted in films &quot;of great passion: Because the actors didn&#x27;t act out the emotions, the audience could internalize them.&quot; In &quot;Against Interpretation&quot;, Susan Sontag wrote that &quot;Some art aims directly at arousing the feelings; some art appeals to the feelings through the route of the intelligence ... art that detaches, that provokes reflection. In the film, the master of the reflective mode is Robert Bresson.&quot; Sontag said that &quot;the form of Bresson’s films is designed (like Ozu&#x27;s) to discipline the emotions at the same time that it arouses them: to induce a certain tranquility in the spectator, a state of spiritual balance that is itself the subject of the film.&quot;
=== Catholicism ===

Bresson was a Catholic, although he disagreed with some points of Catholic theology, explaining that he was not sure of the resurrection of the body and &quot;would rather be a Jansenist than Jesuit&quot; due to his belief in predestination. In his later life he stopped attending church services due to his dissatisfaction with the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s transition to the Mass of Paul VI, explaining that while he still felt a sense of transcendence sitting in a cathedral, Vatican II&#x27;s changes to the Mass made it harder for him to feel the presence of God. Although several writers claim that Bresson described himself as a &quot;Christian atheist&quot;, it is not known in what context he made that statement (if he ever did).

In 1973, Bresson explained:

In a 1976 interview with Paul Schrader, Bresson said that he was concerned by what he saw as &quot;the collapse of the Catholic religion&quot; in France. He did not believe the post-Vatican II Church was capable of responding to this challenge. &quot;The Devil Probably&quot; incorporates some of his criticisms of the post-Vatican II Church. Bresson explained that his youthful protagonist &quot;is looking for something on top of life, but he doesn&#x27;t find it. He goes to Church to seek it, and he doesn&#x27;t find it.&quot; In addition, an early scene in the film shows a young Catholic complaining that the post-Vatican II Church &quot;run[s] after Protestants.&quot;

Some feel that Bresson&#x27;s Catholic upbringing and belief system lie behind the thematic structures of most of his films. Recurring themes under this interpretation include salvation, redemption, defining and revealing the human soul, and metaphysical transcendence of a limiting and materialistic world. An example is &quot;A Man Escaped&quot; (1956), where a seemingly simple plot of a prisoner of war&#x27;s escape can be read as a metaphor for the mysterious process of salvation. However, Bresson&#x27;s films are also critiques of French society and the wider world, with each revealing the director&#x27;s sympathetic, if unsentimental, view of society&#x27;s victims. That the main characters of Bresson&#x27;s most contemporary films, &quot;The Devil, Probably&quot; (1977) and (1983), reach similarly unsettling conclusions about life indicates the director&#x27;s feelings towards the culpability of modern society in the dissolution of individuals. Of an earlier protagonist he said, &quot;Mouchette offers evidence of misery and cruelty. She is found everywhere: wars, concentration camps, tortures, assassinations.&quot; Film historian Mark Cousins argues that &quot;If Bergman and Fellini filmed life as if it was a theatre and a circus, respectively, Bresson&#x27;s microcosm was that of a prison&quot;, describing Bresson&#x27;s characters as &quot;psychologically imprisoned&quot;.

Bresson explained that his films often address secular themes because he believed that a secular film with religious undercurrents was more likely to resonate with modern filmgoers than an explicitly religious theme. Susan Sontag wrote that in his films, while a &quot;religious vocation supplies one setting for ideas about gravity, lucidity, and martyrdom, ... the drastically secular subjects of crime, the revenge of betrayed love, and solitary imprisonment also yield the same themes.&quot; Bresson worried that the new French generation was too materialistic to harbor true religious belief, saying that &quot;every religion is poverty and poverty is the way of having contact with mystery and with God. When Catholicism wants to be materialistic, God is not there.&quot; He tried to reach modern audiences indirectly, explaining, &quot;the more life is what it is—ordinary, simple—without pronouncing the word &#x27;God,&#x27; the more I see the presence of God in that. ... I don&#x27;t want to shoot something in which God would be too transparent.&quot; In his work, &quot;there is a presence of something which I call God, but I don&#x27;t want to show it too much. I prefer to make people feel it.&quot;

Furthermore, in a 1983 interview for TSR&#x27;s &quot;Spécial Cinéma&quot;, Bresson declared that he had been interested in making a film based on the Book of Genesis, although he believed such a production would be too costly and time-consuming.

==Legacy==
Bresson is often referred to as a &quot;patron saint&quot; of cinema, not only for the strong Catholic themes found throughout his oeuvre, but also for his notable contributions to the art of film. His style can be detected through his use of sound, associating selected sounds with images or characters; paring dramatic form to its essentials by the spare use of music; and through his infamous &#x27;actor-model&#x27; methods of directing his almost exclusively non-professional actors. Mark Cousins writes:

So complete was Bresson&#x27;s rejection of cinema norms that he has a tendency to fall outside film history. However, his uncompromising stance has been extremely influential in some quarters.

Bresson&#x27;s book &quot;Notes on the Cinematographer&quot; (1975) is one of the most respected books on film theory and criticism. His theories about film greatly influenced other filmmakers, particularly the French New Wave directors.

===French cinema===
Opposing the established pre-war French cinema (known as &quot;Tradition de la Qualité&quot; [&quot;tradition of quality&quot;]) by offering his own personal responses to the question &quot;what is cinema?&quot;, and by formulating his ascetic style, Bresson gained a high reputation with the founders of the French New Wave. He is often listed (along with Alexandre Astruc and André Bazin) as one of the main figures who influenced them. New Wave pioneers praised Bresson and posited him as a prototype for or precursor to the movement. However, Bresson was neither as overtly experimental nor as outwardly political as the New Wave filmmakers, and his religious views (Catholicism and Jansenism) were not attractive to most of the filmmakers associated with the movement.

In his development of auteur theory, François Truffaut lists Bresson among the few directors to whom the term &quot;auteur&quot; can genuinely be applied, and later names him as one of the only examples of directors who could approach even the so-called &quot;unfilmable&quot; scenes, using the film narrative at its disposal. Jean-Luc Godard also looked upon Bresson with high admiration (&quot;Robert Bresson is French cinema, as Dostoevsky is the Russian novel and Mozart is the German music.&quot;) Screenwriter and director Alain Cavalier describes Bresson&#x27;s role as pivotal not only in the New Wave movement, but for French cinema in general, writing, &quot;In French cinema you have a father and a mother: the father is Bresson and the mother is Renoir, with Bresson representing the strictness of the law and Renoir warmth and generosity. All the better French cinema has and will have to connect to Bresson in some way.&quot;

=== Reception and influence===
Bresson has also influenced a number of other filmmakers, including Andrei Tarkovsky, Chantal Akerman, Jean Eustache, Abel Ferrara, Philippe Garrel, Hal Hartley, Monte Hellman, Jim Jarmusch, Louis Malle, Michael Haneke, Olivier Assayas, Atom Egoyan, the Dardenne brothers, Aki Kaurismäki, and Paul Schrader, whose book &quot;Transcendental Style in Film: Ozu, Bresson, Dreyer&quot; includes a detailed critical analysis. The Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman praised and admired Bresson&#x27;s films such as &quot;Mouchette&quot; and &quot;Diary of a Country Priest&quot;, although he disliked &quot;Au hasard Balthazar&quot;. The French filmmaker Jean Cocteau held Bresson in high regard. The French filmmaker Alain Resnais was a strong admirer of Bresson and his work. The French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Melville was also fond of Bresson and his work. The French filmmaker Jacques Rivette has acknowledged Bresson&#x27;s influence on his films. The Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieślowski was also influenced by him and ranked Bresson&#x27;s film, &quot;A Man Escaped&quot; as one of the top ten films that &quot;affected&quot; him the most. The Italian filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni was influenced by Bresson&#x27;s film &quot;Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne&quot;. The German filmmaker Werner Herzog praised Bresson&#x27;s films such as &quot;Pickpocket&quot; and &quot;Au hasard Balthazar&quot;. The Hungarian filmmaker Béla Tarr was influenced by Bresson and listed Bresson film &quot;Au hasard Balthazar&quot; on his top ten films of all time. The Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami was highly influenced by Bresson and mentioned the personal importance of Bresson&#x27;s book, &quot;Notes on the Cinematographer&quot;. The Greek filmmaker Theo Angelopoulos listed Bresson&#x27;s film &quot;Pickpocket&quot; on his top ten films of all time. The German director Wim Wenders praised and admired Bresson&#x27;s films such as &quot;Au Hasard Balthazar&quot; and &quot;Mouchette&quot;, which were influential to his film career.

The German filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder was influenced by Bresson and championed and paid homage to Bresson&#x27;s film &quot;The Devil Probably&quot; with his film &quot;The Third Generation&quot;. When Fassbinder was a member of the jury in the 1977 Berlin Film Festival, he even went so far as to threaten to leave the jury (when his enthusiasm was not shared by his peers) unless his appreciation for Bresson&#x27;s film was made known to the public. The Dardenne brothers&#x27;s film &quot;L&#x27;Enfant&quot; was influenced by Bresson&#x27;s film &quot;Pickpocket&quot;. The German director Margarethe von Trotta lists Bresson as one of her favorite directors. The American filmmaker Wes Anderson listed &quot;Au hasard Balthazar&quot; as one of his favorite films in the Criterion Collection library and called Bresson&#x27;s film &quot;Mouchette&quot;, &quot;terrific&quot;. The American filmmaker Richard Linklater was influenced by Bresson&#x27;s work and listed &quot;Au hasard Balthazar&quot; and &quot;Pickpocket&quot; in his top 10 film list from the Criterion Collection. The British-American filmmaker Christopher Nolan was influenced by Bresson&#x27;s films (specifically &quot;Pickpocket&quot; and &quot;A Man Escaped&quot;) for his film, &quot;Dunkirk&quot;. The Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos listed Bresson as one of his favorite filmmakers and picked &quot;Pickpocket&quot; as &quot;the most moving film I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. Benny Safdie named the Bresson&#x27;s film &quot;A Man Escaped&quot; as his favorite film of all time. Martin Scorsese praised Bresson as &quot;one of the cinema&#x27;s greatest artists&quot; and an influence on his films such as &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;. Andrei Tarkovsky held Bresson in very high regard, noting him and Ingmar Bergman as his two favourite filmmakers, and stating: &quot;I am only interested in the views of two people: one is called Bresson and one called Bergman.&quot; In his book &quot;Sculpting in Time&quot;, Tarkovsky describes Bresson as &quot;perhaps the only artist in cinema, who achieved the perfect fusion of the finished work with a concept theoretically formulated beforehand.&quot;

=== Rankings over time ===
Although the number of films listed in the decennial &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; poll has changed over time, Bresson has normally been well-represented in these polls. The following table represents the critics&#x27; poll, not the related directors&#x27; poll. Only rankings above #250 are listed.

<text>Dihydrofolate reductase, or DHFR, is an enzyme that reduces dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, using NADPH as an electron donor, which can be converted to the kinds of tetrahydrofolate cofactors used in one-carbon transfer chemistry. In humans, the DHFR enzyme is encoded by the &quot;DHFR&quot; gene. It is found in the q14.1 region of chromosome 5.

There are two structural classes of DHFR, evolutionarily unrelated to each other. The former is usually just called DHFR and is found in bacterial chromosomes and animals. In bacteria, however, antibiotic pressure has caused this class to evolve different patterns of binding diaminoheterocyclic molecules, leading to many &quot;types&quot; named under this class, while mammalian ones remain highly similar. The latter (type II), represented by the plastid-encoded R67, is a tiny enzyme that works by forming a homotetramer.

== Function ==

Dihydrofolate reductase converts dihydrofolate into tetrahydrofolate, a proton shuttle required for the de novo synthesis of purines, thymidylic acid, and certain amino acids. While the functional dihydrofolate reductase gene has been mapped to chromosome 5, multiple intronless processed pseudogenes or dihydrofolate reductase-like genes have been identified on separate chromosomes.

Found in all organisms, DHFR has a critical role in regulating the amount of tetrahydrofolate in the cell. Tetrahydrofolate and its derivatives are essential for purine and thymidylate synthesis, which are important for cell proliferation and cell growth. DHFR plays a central role in the synthesis of nucleic acid precursors, and it has been shown that mutant cells that completely lack DHFR require glycine, a purine, and thymidine to grow. DHFR has also been demonstrated as an enzyme involved in the salvage of tetrahydrobiopterin from dihydrobiopterin.

== Structure ==

A central eight-stranded beta-pleated sheet makes up the main feature of the polypeptide backbone folding of DHFR. Seven of these strands are parallel and the eighth runs antiparallel. Four alpha helices connect successive beta strands. Residues 9–24 are termed &quot;Met20&quot; or &quot;loop 1&quot; and, along with other loops, are part of the major subdomain that surround the active site. The active site is situated in the N-terminal half of the sequence, which includes a conserved Pro-Trp dipeptide; the tryptophan has been shown to be involved in the binding of substrate by the enzyme.

== Mechanism ==

=== General mechanism ===

DHFR catalyzes the transfer of a hydride from NADPH to dihydrofolate with an accompanying protonation to produce tetrahydrofolate. In the end, dihydrofolate is reduced to tetrahydrofolate and NADPH is oxidized to NADP+. The high flexibility of Met20 and other loops near the active site play a role in promoting the release of the product, tetrahydrofolate. In particular the Met20 loop helps stabilize the nicotinamide ring of the NADPH to promote the transfer of the hydride from NADPH to dihydrofolate.

The mechanism of this enzyme is stepwise and steady-state random. Specifically, the catalytic reaction begins with the NADPH and the substrate attaching to the binding site of the enzyme, followed by the protonation and the hydride transfer from the cofactor NADPH to the substrate. However, two latter steps do not take place simultaneously in a same transition state. In a study using computational and experimental approaches, Liu &quot;et al&quot; conclude that the protonation step precedes the hydride transfer.
DHFR&#x27;s enzymatic mechanism is shown to be pH dependent, particularly the hydride transfer step, since pH changes are shown to have remarkable influence on the electrostatics of the active site and the ionization state of its residues. The acidity of the targeted nitrogen on the substrate is important in the binding of the substrate to the enzyme&#x27;s binding site which is proved to be hydrophobic even though it has direct contact to water. Asp27 is the only charged hydrophilic residue in the binding site, and neutralization of the charge on Asp27 may alter the pKa of the enzyme. Asp27 plays a critical role in the catalytic mechanism by helping with protonation of the substrate and restraining the substrate in the conformation favorable for the hydride transfer. The protonation step is shown to be associated with enol tautomerization even though this conversion is not considered favorable for the proton donation. A water molecule is proved to be involved in the protonation step. Entry of the water molecule to the active site of the enzyme is facilitated by the Met20 loop.

=== Conformational changes of DHFR ===

The catalytic cycle of the reaction catalyzed by DHFR incorporates five important intermediate: holoenzyme (E:NADPH), Michaelis complex (E:NADPH:DHF), ternary product complex (E:NADP+:THF), tetrahydrofolate binary complex (E:THF), and THF‚NADPH complex (E:NADPH:THF). The product (THF) dissociation step from E:NADPH:THF to E:NADPH is the rate determining step during steady-state turnover.

Conformational changes are critical in DHFR&#x27;s catalytic mechanism. The Met20 loop of DHFR is able to open, close or occlude the active site. Correspondingly, three different conformations classified as the opened, closed and occluded states are assigned to Met20. In addition, an extra distorted conformation of Met20 was defined due to its indistinct characterization results. The Met20 loop is observed in its occluded conformation in the three product ligating intermediates, where the nicotinamide ring is occluded from the active site. This conformational feature accounts for the fact that the substitution of NADP+ by NADPH is prior to product dissociation. Thus, the next round of reaction can occur upon the binding of substrate.

=== R67 DHFR ===

Due to its unique structure and catalytic features, R67 DHFR is widely studied. R67 DHFR is a type II R-plasmid-encoded DHFR without geneticay or structural relation to the E. coli chromosomal DHFR. It is a homotetramer that possesses the 222 symmetry with a single active site pore that is exposed to solvent. This symmetry of active site results in the different binding mode of the enzyme: It can bind with two dihydrofolate (DHF) molecules with positive cooperativity or two NADPH molecules with negative cooperativity, or one substrate plus one, but only the latter one has the catalytical activity. Compare with E. coli chromosomal DHFR, it has higher Km in binding dihydrofolate (DHF) and NADPH. The much lower catalytical kinetics show that hydride transfer is the rate determine step rather than product (THF) release.

In the R67 DHFR structure, the homotetramer forms an active site pore. In the catalytical process, DHF and NADPH enters into the pore from opposite position. The π-π stacking interaction between NADPH&#x27;s nicotinamide ring and DHF&#x27;s pteridine ring tightly connect two reactants in the active site. However, the flexibility of p-aminobenzoylglutamate tail of DHF was observed upon binding which can promote the formation of the transition state.

== Clinical significance ==

DHFR mutations cause dihydrofolate reductase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of folate metabolism that results in megaloblastic anemia, pancytopenia and severe cerebral folate deficiency. These issues can be overcome by supplementation with a reduced form of folate, usually folinic acid.

== Therapeutic applications ==

DHFR is an attractive pharmaceutical target for inhibition due to its pivotal role in DNA precursor (thymine) synthesis. Trimethoprim, an antibiotic, inhibits bacterial DHFR while methotrexate, a chemotherapy agent, inhibits mammalian DHFR. However, resistance has developed against some drugs, as a result of mutational changes in DHFR itself.

=== Cancer ===
DHFR is responsible for the levels of tetrahydrofolate in a cell, and the inhibition of DHFR can limit the growth and proliferation of cells that are characteristic of cancer and bacterial infections. Methotrexate, a competitive inhibitor of DHFR, is one such anticancer drug that inhibits DHFR.

Folate is necessary for growth, and the pathway of the metabolism of folate is a target in developing treatments for cancer. DHFR is one such target. A regimen of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and methotrexate was shown to prolong survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer. Further studies into inhibitors of DHFR can lead to more ways to treat cancer.

=== Infection ===
Bacteria also need DHFR to grow and multiply and hence inhibitors selective for bacterial DHFR have found application as antibacterial agents. Trimethoprim has shown to have activity against a variety of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. However, resistance to trimethoprim and other drugs aimed at DHFR can arise due to a variety of mechanisms, limiting the success of their therapeutical uses. Resistance can arise from DHFR gene amplification, mutations in DHFR, decrease in the uptake of the drugs, among others. Regardless, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole in combination has been used as an antibacterial agent for decades.

Pyrimethamine is a widely used antiprotozoal agent.

Other classes of compounds that target DHFR in general, and bacterial DHFRs in particular, belong to the classes such as diaminopteridines, diaminotriazines, diaminopyrroloquinazolines, stilbenes, chalcones, deoxybenzoins, diaminoquinazolines, diaminopyrroloquinazolines, to name but a few.

==== Potential anthrax treatment ====
Dihydrofolate reductase from &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot; (BaDHFR) is a validated drug target in the treatment of the infectious disease, anthrax. BaDHFR is less sensitive to trimethoprim analogs than is dihydrofolate reductase from other species such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;. A structural alignment of dihydrofolate reductase from all four species shows that only BaDHFR has the combination phenylalanine and tyrosine in positions 96 and 102, respectively.

BaDHFR&#x27;s resistance to trimethoprim analogs is due to these two residues (F96 and Y102), which also confer improved kinetics and catalytic efficiency. Current research uses active site mutants in BaDHFR to guide lead optimization for new antifolate inhibitors.

== As a research tool ==

DHFR has been used as a tool to detect protein–protein interactions in a protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA), using a split-protein approach.

DHFR-lacking CHO cells are the most commonly used cell line for the production of recombinant proteins. These cells are transfected with a plasmid carrying the &quot;dhfr&quot; gene and the gene for the recombinant protein in a single expression system, and then subjected to selective conditions in thymidine-lacking medium. Only the cells with the exogenous DHFR gene along with the gene of interest survive. Supplementation of this medium with methotrexate, a competitive inhibitor of DHFR, can further select for those cells expressing the highest levels of DHFR, and thus, select for the top recombinant protein producers.

== Interactions ==

Dihydrofolate reductase has been shown to interact with GroEL and Mdm2.
