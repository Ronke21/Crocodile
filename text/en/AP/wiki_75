<text>Claude Henri Jean Chabrol (; 24 June 1930 – 12 September 2010) was a French film director and a member of the French New Wave (&quot;nouvelle vague&quot;) group of filmmakers who first came to prominence at the end of the 1950s. Like his colleagues and contemporaries Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Éric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette, Chabrol was a critic for the influential film magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; before beginning his career as a film maker.

Chabrol&#x27;s career began with &quot;Le Beau Serge&quot; (1958), inspired by Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; (1943). Thrillers became something of a trademark for Chabrol, with an approach characterized by a distanced objectivity. This is especially apparent in &quot;Les Biches&quot; (1968), &quot;La Femme infidèle&quot; (1969), and &quot;Le Boucher&quot; (1970) – all featuring Stéphane Audran, who was his wife at the time.

Sometimes characterized as a &quot;mainstream&quot; New Wave director, Chabrol remained prolific and popular throughout his half-century career. In 1978, he cast Isabelle Huppert as the lead in &quot;Violette Nozière&quot;. On the strength of that effort, the pair went on to others including the successful &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; (1991) and &quot;La Cérémonie&quot; (1995). Film critic John Russell Taylor has stated that &quot;there are few directors whose films are more difficult to explain or evoke on paper, if only because so much of the overall effect turns on Chabrol&#x27;s sheer hedonistic relish for the medium...Some of his films become almost private jokes, made to amuse himself.&quot; James Monaco has called Chabrol &quot;the craftsman par excellence of the New Wave, and his variations upon a theme give us an understanding of the explicitness and precision of the language of the film that we don&#x27;t get from the more varied experiments in genre of Truffaut or Godard.&quot;

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Claude Henri Jean Chabrol was born on 24 June 1930 to Yves Chabrol and Madeleine Delarbre in Paris and grew up in Sardent, France, a village in the region of Creuse 400 km (240 miles) south of Paris. Chabrol said that he always thought of himself as a country person, and never as a Parisian. Both Chabrol&#x27;s father and grandfather had been pharmacists, and Chabrol was expected to follow in the family business. But as a child, Chabrol was &quot;seized by the demon of cinema&quot; and ran a film club in a barn in Sardent between the ages of 12 and 14. It was at this time that he developed his passion for the thriller genre, detective stories and other forms of popular fiction.

===Early years in Paris===
After World War II, Chabrol moved to Paris to study pharmacology and literature at the Sorbonne, where he received a licence en lettres. Some biographies also state that he briefly studied law and political science at the École Libre des Sciences Politiques. While living in Paris Chabrol became involved with the postwar cine club culture and frequented Henri Langlois&#x27;s Cinémathèque Française and the Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin, where he first met Éric Rohmer, Jacques Rivette, Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut and other future &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; journalists and French New Wave filmmakers. After graduating, Chabrol served his mandatory military service in the French Medical Corps, serving in Germany and reaching the rank of sergeant. Chabrol has said that while in the army he worked as a film projectionist. After he was discharged from the army, he joined his friends as a staff writer for &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;, who were challenging then-contemporary French films and championing the concept of Auteur theory. As a film critic, Chabrol advocated realism both morally and aesthetically, mise-en-scene, and deep focus cinematography, which he wrote &quot;brings the spectator in closer with the image&quot; and encourages &quot;both a more active mental attitude on the part of the spectator and a more positive contribution on his part to the action in progress.&quot; He also wrote for &quot;Arts&quot; magazine during this period. Among Chabrol&#x27;s most famous articles were &quot;Little Themes&quot;, a study of genre films, and &quot;The Evolution of Detective Films&quot;.

In 1955 Chabrol was briefly employed as a publicity man at the French offices of 20th Century Fox, but was told that he was &quot;the worst press officer they&#x27;d ever seen&quot; and was replaced by Jean-Luc Godard, who they said was even worse. In 1956 he helped finance Jacques Rivette&#x27;s short film &quot;Le coup du berger&quot;, and later helped finance Rohmer&#x27;s short &quot;Véronique et son cancre&quot; in 1958. Unlike all of his future New Wave contemporaries, Chabrol never made short film nor did he work as an assistant on other directors&#x27; work before making his feature film debut. In 1957 Chabrol and Eric Rohmer co-wrote &quot;Hitchcock&quot; (Paris: Éditions Universitaires, 1957), a study of the films made by director Alfred Hitchcock through the film &quot;The Wrong Man&quot;. Chabrol had said that Rohmer deserves the majority of the credit for the book, while he mainly worked on the sections pertaining to Hitchcock&#x27;s early American films, &quot;Rebecca&quot;, &quot;Notorious&quot;, and &quot;Stage Fright&quot;. Chabrol had interviewed Hitchcock with François Truffaut in 1954 on the set of &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;, where the two famously walked into a water tank after being starstruck by Hitchcock. Years later, when Chabrol and Truffaut had both become successful directors themselves, Hitchcock told Truffaut that he always thought of them when he saw &quot;ice cubes in a glass of whiskey.&quot;

===1957–1967: Early film career===
The most prolific of the major New Wave directors, Chabrol averaged almost one film a year from 1958 until his death. His early films (roughly 1958–1963) are usually categorized as part of the New Wave and generally have the experimental qualities associated with the movement; while his later early films are usually categorized as being intentionally commercial and far less experimental. In the mid-sixties it was difficult for Chabrol to obtain financing for films so he made a series of commercial &quot;potboilers&quot; and spy spoofs, which none of the other New Wave filmmakers did.

Chabrol had married Agnès Goute in 1952 and in 1957 his wife inherited a large sum of money from relatives. In December of that year Chabrol used the money to make his feature directorial debut with &quot;Le Beau Serge&quot;. Chabrol spent three months shooting in his hometown of Sardent using a small crew and little known actors. The film&#x27;s budget was $85,000. The film starred Jean-Claude Brialy as François and Gérard Blain as Serge, two childhood friends reunited when the recent medical school graduate François returns to Sardent and discovers that Serge has become an alcoholic after the stillbirth of his physically retarded first child. Despite suffering from tuberculosis, François drags Serge through a snowstorm to witness the birth of his second child, thus giving Serge a reason to live while killing himself in the process. &quot;Le Beau Serge&quot; is considered the inaugural film of the French New Wave Film movement that would peak between 1959 and 1962. Chabrol was the first of his friends to complete a feature film (although Jacques Rivette had already begun filming his first feature &quot;Paris nous appartient&quot;), and it immediately received critical praise and was a box office success. It won the Grand Prix at the Locarno Film Festival and the Prix Jean Vigo. Critics noticed similarities to Hitchcock&#x27;s films, such as the motifs of doubling and re-occurrences and the &quot;Catholic guilt transference&quot; that Chabrol had also written about extensively in his and Rohmer&#x27;s book the year earlier. Chabrol stated that he made the film as a &quot;farewell to Catholicism&quot;, and many critics have called his first film vastly different from any of his subsequent films.

Chabrol quickly followed this success up with &quot;Les Cousins&quot; in 1958. The film is a companion piece and a reversal to &quot;Le Beau Serge&quot; in many ways, such as having the responsible student Brialy now play the decadent and insensitive Paul while the reckless Blain now plays the hard-working law student Charles. In this film, the country cousin Charles arrives in the big city of Paris to live with his corrupt cousin Paul while attending school. This was the first of many Chabrol films to include characters named Paul and Charles, and later films would often include a female named Hélène. More so than his first film, &quot;Les Cousins&quot; features many characteristics that would be seen as &quot;Chabrolian&quot;, including the Hitchcock influence, a depiction of the French bourgeoisie, characters with ambiguous motives and a murder. It was also Chabrol&#x27;s first film co-written with his longtime collaborator Paul Gégauff, of whom Chabrol once said &quot;when I want cruelty, I go off and look for Gégauff. Paul is very good at gingering things up...He can make a character look absolutely ridiculous and hateful in two seconds flat.&quot; &quot;Les Cousins&quot; was another box office success in France and won the Golden Bear at the 9th Berlin International Film Festival.

Chabrol formed his own production company AJYM Productions (acronym based on the initials of his wife&#x27;s and children&#x27;s names) at the time of making &quot;Le Beau Serge&quot;. After the success of &quot;Le Beau Serge&quot; and &quot;Les Cousins&quot;, Chabrol began funding many of the films of his friends. AJYM helped fund Eric Rohmer&#x27;s feature debut &quot;The Sign of Leo&quot;, partially funded Rivette&#x27;s &quot;Paris nous appartient&quot;, and Philippe de Broca&#x27;s films &quot;Les Jeux de l&#x27;amour&quot; and &quot;Le farceur&quot;. He also donated excess film stock from &quot;Les Cousins&quot; to Rivette to complete &quot;Paris nous appartient&quot;. Chabrol was also a technical advisor on Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s feature debut &quot;Breathless&quot; and acted in small parts in many of his friends&#x27; and his own early films. For his support to the early careers of so many of his friends, Chabrol has been referred to as &quot;the godfather of the French New Wave&quot;, although many film histories tend to overlook this contribution and dismiss Chabrol altogether.

After two box office hits in a row, Chabrol was given a big budget to make his first color film, &quot;À double tour&quot; (&quot;Léda&quot;) in the spring of 1959. The film stars Jean-Paul Belmondo as Laszlo and Antonella Lualdi as Léda, two outsiders of a bourgeois family who experience different results when attempting to enter that family. Chabrol adapted the script with Paul Gégauff from a novel by Stanley Ellin, and the film is known for its oedipal sex triangle and murder scenario. The film was shot on location in Aix-en-Provence with cinematographer Henri Decaë and includes choppy, hand-held camera footage that is atypical of a Chabrol film despite being present in many of the New Wave films made at the same time. The film was both a box office and critical disappointment, and critic Roy Armes criticized &quot;Chabrol&#x27;s lack of feeling for his characters and love of overacting.&quot;

In 1960 Chabrol made what is considered by many critics as his best early film, &quot;Les Bonnes Femmes&quot;. The film stars Bernadette Lafont, Clotilde Joano, Stéphane Audran and Lucile Saint-Simon as four Parisian appliance store employees who all dream of an escape from their mediocre lives, and the different outcomes for each girl. Most critics praised the film, such as Robin Wood and James Monaco. However some left-wing critics disliked Chabrol&#x27;s depiction of working-class people and accused him of making fun of their lifestyles. The film was another box office disappointment for Chabrol. It was followed with two films that were also financially unsuccessful and which Chabrol has admitted to making purely for &quot;commercial reasons&quot;. &quot;Les Godelureaux&quot; was made in 1960 and hated by Chabrol. &quot;The Third Lover&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Œil du Malin&quot;), released in 1961, received better reviews than Chabrol&#x27;s previous films, with critics pointing out that the films that Chabrol wrote without Paul Gégauff were much more compassionate and realistic than the ones with Gégauff. It was shot on location in Munich. Although she had appeared in supporting roles in several Chabrol films before, &quot;The Third Lover&quot; was the first Chabrol film in which Stéphane Audran appeared as the female lead. They later married in 1964 and worked together until the late 1970s.

In 1962 Chabrol made &quot;Ophelia&quot;, a loose adaptation of &quot;Hamlet&quot; that was another box office disappointment. Later that year he had a minor hit film with &quot;Landru&quot;, written by Françoise Sagan and starring Charles Denner, Michèle Morgan, Danielle Darrieux and Hildegard Knef. The film depicts the famous French serial killer Henri Désiré Landru, a story that had previously inspired Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s film &quot;Monsieur Verdoux&quot;.

From 1964 to 1967 Chabrol made six films and one short that were critically and commercially disastrous, and this period is considered a low point of his career. Four of these films were in the then-popular genre of spy spoof films, including &quot;Le Tigre aime la chair fraiche&quot; and &quot;Le Tigre se parfume à la dynamite&quot;. Chabrol had said that &quot;I like to get to the absolute limit of principles...In drivel like the Tiger series I really wanted to get the full extent of the drivel. They were drivel, so OK, let&#x27;s get into it up to our necks.&quot; During this period a Variety headline read &quot;Vital To Keep Making Pictures, and What Sort Not Relevant; Chabrol No &#x27;Doctrinaire&#x27; Type.&quot; In 1965 Chabrol also contributed to the New Wave portmanteau film &quot;Six in Paris&quot; with the segment &quot;La Muette&quot;. Chabrol co-starred with Stéphane Audran as a middle aged couple dealing with their rebellious teenage daughter. In 1964 Chabrol also directed a stage production of &quot;MacBeth&quot; for the Théâtre Récamier.

===1968–1978: &quot;Golden Era&quot;===

In 1968 Chabrol began working with film producer André Génovès and started to make more critically acclaimed films that would later be considered his &quot;Golden Era&quot;. Most of these films revolved around themes of bourgeois characters and a murder is almost always part of the plot. Unlike his earlier films, most of these films centered around middle aged people. Chabrol often worked with the same people during this period including actors Audran and Michel Bouquet, cinematographer Jean Rabier, editor Jacques Gaillard, sound technician Guy Chichignoud, composer Pierre Jansen, set designer Guy Littaye, as well as producer Génovés and co-writer Paul Gégauff.

In 1968 Chabrol made &quot;Les Biches&quot;, one of his most acclaimed works. The film stars Stéphane Audran as the dominant and bisexual Frédérique, who finds a young protege in the bisexual Why (Jacqueline Sassard), until they both become the lover of a young architect named Paul (Jean-Louis Trintignant). Why ends up killing Frédérique, but it is unclear whether she murdered her cheating lover or the person that her lover was cheating with. The film received critical praise and was a box office hit. Chabrol followed this with a similar film &quot;The Unfaithful Wife&quot; (&quot;La Femme infidèle&quot;), in which a husband named Charles murders the lover of his cheating wife. It was later remade in 2002 by director Adrian Lyne. Chabrol finished the decade with &quot;This Man Must Die&quot; (&quot;Que la bête meure&quot;) in 1969. Based on an original story by Cecil Day-Lewis, in the film Charles (Michel Duchaussoy) plots to kill Paul (Jean Yanne) after Paul killed Charles&#x27; son in a hit and run car accident. However the film&#x27;s ending is left intentionally ambiguous, and Chabrol has stated that &quot;you&#x27;ll never see a Charles kill a Paul. Never.&quot; The film was especially praised for its landscape cinematography.

In 1970 Chabrol made &quot;The Butcher&quot; (&quot;Le boucher&quot;) starring Jean Yanne and Stéphane Audran. Yanne plays Popaul, a former war hero known for his violent behavior, much like that depicted in the prehistoric cave drawings that the characters look at in their Périgord community. The French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; called it &quot;the best French film since the liberation.&quot; After another examination of bourgeois life in &quot;The Breach&quot; (&quot;La Rupture&quot;) in 1970, Chabrol made &quot;Just Before Nightfall&quot; (&quot;Juste avant la nuit&quot;) in 1971. The film stars Michel Bouquet as an ad executive named Charles who kills his mistress but cannot handle the guilt, so he confesses his crime to her husband (François Périer) and his wife (Stéphane Audran), expecting their condemnation. To his surprise they are only compassionate and forgiving to his crime and Charles cannot find relief from the guilt of what he has done. Later in 1971 Chabrol made &quot;Ten Days&#x27; Wonder&quot; (&quot;La Décade prodigieuse&quot;), based on a novel by Ellery Queen. The film was shot in English and starred Michel Piccoli, Anthony Perkins and Orson Welles. It received poor critical reviews. He followed this with the equally disliked &quot;Dr. Popaul&quot;, starring Jean-Paul Belmondo and Mia Farrow. Critics compared the film unfavorably with Chabrol&#x27;s earlier film that centered on a &quot;Landru-like&quot; theme. Critic Jacques Siclier said that &quot;the &quot;novelty&quot; of &quot;Docteur Popaul&quot; comes from the offhandedness with which the criminal history is treated.&quot;

Chabrol took a slight change of pace with his 1973 film &quot;Wedding in Blood&quot; (&quot;Les Noces rouges&quot;) by making his first film with political themes. The film stars Audran and Michel Piccoli as lovers who plot to murder Audran&#x27;s husband, who is the corrupt gaullist mayor of their town. To their surprise the President of France orders that no investigation be made of the mayor&#x27;s death, leading the murdering couple to suspect political interest in their crime. In the spring of 1973 the French government banned the film for one month, allegedly so that it would not influence members of the jury of a controversial criminal trial. Chabrol followed this political theme with &quot;Nada&quot;, in which a group of young anarchists kidnap an American ambassador. It was Chabrol&#x27;s first film to not center on the bourgeois since &quot;Le Beau Serge&quot;. Chabrol returned to more familiar ground in 1975 with &quot;A piece of pleasure&quot; (&quot;Une partie de plaisir&quot;). In this film screenwriter Paul Gégauff plays a writer with a troubled marriage that ends in tragedy. (In 1983, Gégauff was stabbed to death in real life by his second wife.) Gégauff&#x27;s wife is played by his real-life first wife Danièle Gégauff (already divorced when this film was made) and his daughter is played by real life daughter Clemence Gégauff. The film received poor critical reviews, with Richard Roud calling it &quot;rather interestingly loathsome.&quot;

Chabrol ended his Golden Period with one of his most admired and his most controversial films &quot;Violette Nozière&quot; in 1978. The film starred a young Isabelle Huppert as a real life Parisian girl from a respectable petit-bourgeois family in the 1930s. At night Violette sneaks out to pick up men and eventually contracts syphilis, which she convinces her parents must be hereditary before she kills them. The film was controversial in France but praised in other countries.

===1979–2009: Later work===
In the 1980s and 1990s Chabrol engaged himself with many different projects for both TV and the silver screen. His films &quot;Poulet au vinaigre&quot; (1985) and &quot;Masques&quot; (1987) were entered into the 38th Cannes Film Festival and 37th Berlin International Film Festival respectively. &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; (1991) was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design. It was also entered into the 17th Moscow International Film Festival. &quot;La Cérémonie&quot; (1995) is perhaps his most acclaimed film from this period, as it was nominated for numerous César Awards and was entered into the 52nd Venice International Film Festival among other. His 1999 film &quot;The Color of Lies&quot; was entered into the 49th Berlin International Film Festival.

In 1995 Chabrol was awarded the Prix René Clair from the Académie française for his body of work.

Chabrol continued directing films and TV series well into the 2000s.

==Personal life==

Chabrol&#x27;s first marriage to Agnès Goute (1956–1962) produced a son, Matthieu Chabrol, a composer who scored most of his father&#x27;s films from the early 1980s. He divorced Agnès to marry the actress Stéphane Audran, with whom he had a son, actor Thomas Chabrol. They remained married from 1964 to 1978. His third wife was Aurore Paquiss, who has been a script supervisor since the 1950s. He had four children. Chabrol was a known gourmet chef and shot &quot;10 Days Wonder&quot; in Alsace only because he wanted to visit its restaurants. Although he acknowledges the influence of Alfred Hitchcock in his work, Chabrol has stated that &quot;others have influenced me more. My three greatest influences were Murnau, the great silent film director...Ernst Lubitsch and Fritz Lang.&quot;

Chabrol died on 12 September 2010 of leukemia. He is buried in Pere Lachaise Cemetery in north-eastern Paris.

<doc id="102579" wikidata="Q969527" url="?curid=102579" title="Heinosuke Gosho">
<text>was a Japanese film director and screenwriter who directed Japan&#x27;s first successful sound film, &quot;The Neighbor&#x27;s Wife and Mine&quot;, in 1931. His films are mostly associated with the shōshimin-eiga (lit. &quot;common people drama&quot;) genre. Among his most noted works are &quot;Where Chimneys Are Seen&quot;, &quot;An Inn at Osaka&quot;, &quot;Takekurabe&quot; and &quot;Yellow Crow&quot;. 

==Life==
Gosho was born on January 24, 1902, in Kanda, Tokyo, to merchant Heisuke Gosho and his father&#x27;s geisha mistress. At the age of five, after Heisuke&#x27;s eldest son died, Gosho left his mother to be the successor to his father&#x27;s wholesale business. He studied business at Keio University, graduating in 1923.

Through his father&#x27;s close relation to film director Yasujirō Shimazu, Gosho was able to join the Shochiku film studios and worked as assistant director to Shimazu. In 1925, Gosho debuted as a director with the film &quot;Nantō no haru&quot;. His films of the 1920s are nowadays regarded as lost. 

Gosho&#x27;s first notable success, and Japan&#x27;s first feature length sound film, was the 1931 comedy &quot;The Neighbor&#x27;s Wife and Mine&quot; about a writer distracted by a noisy next-door jazz band. Naming Ernst Lubitsch&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage Circle&quot; and Charles Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;A Woman of Paris&quot; as the greatest foreign influences, Gosho&#x27;s work oscillated between comedy and drama, sometimes mixing the two, which earned his films the reputation of making the viewer &quot;laugh and cry at the same time&quot;. Other Gosho trademarks were his fast editing style and his repeated relying on literary sources, such as the works of Yūzō Yamamoto and Ichiyō Higuchi. Together with Shirō Toyoda, Gosho was one of the first directors to adapt the works of the &quot;junbungaku&quot; (&quot;pure literature&quot;) movement for the screen, which opposed &quot;popular&quot; literature in favour of &quot;serious&quot; literature and a more complex handling of its subjects. A prominent example is &quot;The Dancing Girl of Izu&quot; (1933), a successful adaptation of Yasunari Kawabata&#x27;s story of the same name, about the unfulfilled love between a student and a young country woman. Of his 36 1930s films, only slightly more than a half-dozen are extant.

A firm believer in humanism, Gosho tried to reduce militarist content in his wartime films, and showed solidarity with dismissed co-workers during the Toho studios strike of 1948. In 1950 he started the independent production company Studio Eight together with Shirō Toyoda and other former studio employees. Studio Eight&#x27;s first production was Gosho&#x27;s 1951 drama &quot;Dispersed Clouds&quot; about an unhappy young woman from Tokyo finding fulfilment as assistant of a country doctor. His best-known works of this era are the social realist marriage drama &quot;Where Chimneys Are Seen&quot; (1953), which was shown in competition at the Berlin International Film Festival, and &quot;Yellow Crow&quot; (1957), the portrait of a troubled father-son-relationship, which received the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Although his films grew darker in tone by the mid-1950s, evident in works like &quot;An Inn at Osaka&quot;, about a group of Osaka residents struggling with an unrestrained materialistic environment, he stayed true to his ideals of &quot;tolerance, compromise and rationality&quot;.

Gosho was also one of the first major Japanese directors to work extensively for television as a writer. Due to the rapid changes in the film industry at the time, Gosho&#x27;s work in the 1960s alternated mostly between melodrama and shomin-geki, sometimes not exceeding well-made commercial entertainment. Notable films of this era are &quot;Hunting Rifle&quot; (1961), based on Yasushi Inoue&#x27;s novella about an adulterous couple, &quot;An Innocent Witch&quot; (1965), the account of a young prostitute falling victim to superstition, and &quot;Rebellion of Japan&quot; (1967), a love story set against the backdrop of the February 26 Incident. His last feature-length directorial effort was the puppet film &quot;Meiji haru aki&quot; (1968). 

Between 1964 and 1980, Gosho served as president of the Directors Guild of Japan. Although having repeatedly worked with internationally known actresses and actors like Kinuyo Tanaka, few of his films have been seen in the West. In 1989–1990, a retrospective of his work was held by the Japan Society and the Museum of Modern Art, New York.

Gosho also wrote haiku poems and served as director of the Japanese Haiku Art Association.

<doc id="102580" wikidata="Q257818" url="?curid=102580" title="Throne of Blood">
<text>is a 1957 Japanese &quot;jidaigeki&quot; film co-written, produced, edited, and directed by Akira Kurosawa, with special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya. The film transposes the plot of English dramatist William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1606) from Medieval Scotland to feudal Japan, with stylistic elements drawn from Noh drama. The film stars Toshiro Mifune and Isuzu Yamada in the lead roles, modelled on the characters Macbeth and Lady Macbeth.

As with the play, the film tells the story of a warrior who assassinates his sovereign at the urging of his ambitious wife. Kurosawa was a fan of the play and intended to make his own adaptation for several years, delaying it after learning of Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1948). Among his changes was the ending, which required archers to shoot arrows around Mifune. The film was shot around Mount Fuji and Izu Peninsula. With a budget of (), the film was one of the most expensive films ever made in Japan at the time of its release.

Despite the change in setting and language and numerous creative liberties, &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; is often considered one of the best film adaptations of the classic play, and has received much critical praise. The film won two Mainichi Film Awards, including Best Actor for Toshiro Mifune.

==Plot==
Generals Miki and Washizu are samurai commanders and friends under Tsuzuki, a local lord who reigns in the castle of the Spider&#x27;s Web Forest. After defeating the lord&#x27;s enemies in battle, they return to his castle. On their way through the thick forest, they encounter a spirit who foretells their future, informing them that Washizu will be named Lord of the Northern Garrison and Miki will become commander of the first fortress that day. The spirit then foretells that Washizu eventually will become Lord of Spider&#x27;s Web Castle, and finally, Miki&#x27;s son will become lord. When the two return to Tsuzuki&#x27;s estate, he rewards them with exactly what the spirit had predicted. As Washizu discusses this with his wife Asaji, she manipulates him into causing the second part of the prophecy to come true by murdering Tsuzuki when he visits.

Asaji gives drugged sake to Tsuzuki&#x27;s guards, causing them to fall asleep and allowing Washizu to enter Tsuzuki&#x27;s bedchamber and kill him in his sleep. When Washizu returns in shock at his deed, Asaji grabs the bloody spear and puts it in the hands of an unconscious guard, then cries out that an intruder has entered the castle; Washizu slays the guard before he has a chance to plead his innocence. Kunimaru, Tsuzuki&#x27;s vengeful son, and Noriyasu, one of Tsuzuki&#x27;s advisors, both suspect Washizu&#x27;s treachery and try to warn Miki, who refuses to believe what they are saying about his friend. Under Asaji&#x27;s influence, Washizu is unsure of Miki&#x27;s loyalty but chooses Miki&#x27;s son as his heir because he and Asaji have no child of their own. Washizu plans to tell Miki and his son about his decision at a grand banquet. However, Asaji tells him that she is pregnant, which leaves him with a quandary concerning his heir: now, Miki and his son have to be eliminated.

During the banquet, Washizu is agitated because Miki and his son have not arrived and drinks sake copiously. He loses his self-control when Miki&#x27;s ghost suddenly appears. In a delusional panic, he reveals what has happened to Miki by exclaiming that he is willing to slay Miki a second time, unsheathing his sword and slashing at the empty air near Miki&#x27;s seat. Attempting to cover for him, Asaji tells the guests that he is drunk and has everyone retire for the evening. One of Washizu&#x27;s men arrives carrying a bundle containing the severed head of Miki, and tells Washizu and Asaji that Miki&#x27;s son escaped. Washizu kills the man.

Later, Washizu&#x27;s men are beginning to doubt and fear him, and rumors circulate that Miki&#x27;s son Yoshiteru, Kunimaru, and Noriyasu have joined forces with their onetime rival Inui. Washizu is distraught by the news that his heir has been born dead. In order to ascertain the outcome of the impending battle with his foes, he returns to the forest in search of the evil spirit. The spirit tells him that he will not be defeated in battle until &quot;the trees of the Spider&#x27;s Web Forest rise against the castle&quot;. Washizu believes this is impossible and becomes confident of his victory. Washizu tells his troops of the prophecy, and they share his confidence. The next morning, Washizu is awakened by the screams of Asaji&#x27;s attendants. In her quarters, he finds Asaji in a semi-catatonic state, trying to wash clean an imaginary stain and stench of blood from her hands. Distracted by the sound of his troops, Washizu leaves to investigate. Washizu is told by a panicked soldier that the trees of Spider&#x27;s Web Forest &quot;have risen to attack us&quot;.

Washizu tries to muster his troops, but they ignore his commands and begin firing arrows at him. Several go through his armor, and one pierces his neck, severely wounding him. When Washizu tells them that to kill their lord is treason, they accuse him of the murder of his predecessor. With his enemies approaching the castle gates, he falls to his arrow wounds, trying to draw his sword as he dies. It is then revealed that the attacking force had used trees, cut from the forest during the night, to shield their advance onto the castle.

==Production==
===Development===

William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays had been read in Japan since the Meiji Restoration in 1868, though banned during World War II for not being Japanese. Director Akira Kurosawa stated that he had admired Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; for a long time, and that he envisioned making a film adaptation of it after he completed his 1950 film &quot;Rashomon&quot;. When he learned that Orson Welles had released his own version of &quot;Macbeth&quot; in 1948, Kurosawa decided to postpone his adaptation project for several years.

Kurosawa believed that Scotland and Japan in the Middle Ages shared social problems and that these had lessons for the present day. Moreover, &quot;Macbeth&quot; could serve as a cautionary tale complementing his 1952 film &quot;Ikiru&quot;.

In May 1956, Kurosawa announced that he would be producing three samurai films for Toho, &quot;Throne of Blood&quot;, &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot;, and &quot;Revenge&quot;, each to be filmed from September 1956 to early 1957 by other directors. Ishirō Honda, best known for directing the 1954 &quot;kaiju&quot; film &quot;Godzilla&quot;, was slated to direct &quot;Throne of Blood&quot;, but Kurosawa ended up directing all three films himself.

The film combines Shakespeare&#x27;s play with the Noh style of drama. Kurosawa was an admirer of Noh, which he preferred over Kabuki. In particular, he wished to incorporate Noh-style body movements and set design. Noh also makes use of masks, and the evil spirit is seen, in different parts of the film, wearing faces reminiscent of these masks, starting with &quot;yaseonna&quot; (old lady). Noh often stresses the Buddhist doctrine of impermanence. This is connected to Washizu being denied salvation, with the chorus singing that his ghost is still in the world. Furthermore, the film score&#x27;s use of flute and drum are drawn from Noh.

===Writing===
All three of Kurosawa&#x27;s frequent script collaborators participated for the first time: Hideo Oguni, Shinobu Hashimoto, and Ryūzō Kikushima, each working with the director for their fourth time. Initially, the screenwriters wrote the script with the intention that it would be directed by Ishirō Honda, but Toho insisted Kurosawa take the directing position after reading the script and realizing a large budget was required for the film.

===Set design===

The castle exteriors were built and shot on the volcanic slopes of Mount Fuji. The castle courtyard was constructed at Toho&#x27;s Tamagawa studio, with volcanic soil brought from Fuji so that the ground matched. The interiors were shot in a smaller studio in Tokyo. The forest scenes were a combination of actual Fuji forest and studio shots in Tokyo. Washizu&#x27;s mansion was shot in the Izu Peninsula.

In Kurosawa&#x27;s own words: 

Production designer Yoshirō Muraki said the crew opted to employ the color black in the set walls, and a lot of armor, to complement the mist and fog effects. This design was based on ancient scrolls depicting Japanese castles.

===Special effects===
The scene in which trees from the Spider&#x27;s Web Forest approach the castle, was created by Toho&#x27;s special effects department and directed by Eiji Tsuburaya. Originally, this scene was longer, but Kurosawa cut several shots of trees from the film because he was unimpressed by them.

Washizu&#x27;s death scene, in which his own archers turn upon him and shoot him with arrows, was in fact performed with real arrows, shot by knowledgeable and skilled archers. During filming, Mifune waved his arms, which was how the actor indicated his intended bodily direction. This was for his own safety in order to prevent the archers from accidentally hitting him.

==Release==
The film was released theatrically in Japan on January 15, 1957, by Toho, and grossed , making it the second-highest-grossing Japanese film of 1957, after Shintoho&#x27;s &quot;Emperor Meiji and the Great Russo-Japanese War&quot;, which grossed ¥542.91 million. In the United States, the film was distributed by Brandon Films with English subtitles at 105 minutes and opened on November 22, 1961.

&quot;Throne of Blood&quot; was the first film to be screened at the 1st BFI London Film Festival on October 16, 1957. After the screening, Akira Kurosawa attended a party at film critic Dilys Powell&#x27;s house, and had dinner with actor Laurence Olivier, and actress Vivien Leigh who were planning on playing Macbeth and Lady Macbeth in a film adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; that never materialized. Olivier told Kurosawa that he had enjoyed watching the film and was impressed by the scene in which Toshiro Mifune&#x27;s Macbeth is shot by arrows. Isuzu Yamada&#x27;s acting impressed Leigh, and she asked why Yamada made such little movement when she was mad.

In 1991, the film was released in the United States on LaserDisc by The Criterion Collection, and on VHS by Media Home Entertainment. Toho released the film on DVD in Japan in 2002 and on Blu-ray in 2010. In 2013, Madman Entertainment distributed the film on DVD in Region 4. In Region A, The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray in 2014, having released the film on DVD 10 years earlier.

In 2018, the film was screened by the National Film Archive of Japan at the &quot;Essential 2018 National Film Archive Opening Cinema Memorial&quot; in Kyōbashi, Tokyo, along with 9 other Japanese films. In 2021, the Kawakita Memorial Film Institute screened a 4K remaster of the film at the 12th 10am Film Festival.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 96% based on 47 reviews, with an average score of 8.80/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A career high point for Akira Kurosawa – and one of the best film adaptations of a Shakespeare play.&quot;

When it was released in the United States in 1961, the &quot;Time&quot; review praised Kurosawa and the film as &quot;a visual descent into the hell of greed and superstition&quot;.

Bosley Crowther from &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the idea of Shakespeare in Japanese &quot;amusing&quot;, and complimented the cinematography. Most critics stated it was the visuals that filled the gap left by the removal of Shakespeare&#x27;s poetry.

U.K. directors Geoffrey Reeve and Peter Brook considered the film to be a masterpiece, but denied it was a Shakespeare film because of the language. Film historian Donald Richie praised the film as &quot;a marvel because it is made of so little: fog, wind, trees, mist&quot;. Film critic Stephen Prince compared its minimalist landscapes to the painting technique &quot;sumi-e&quot;.

David Parkinson of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine rated it 5 out of 5, calling it &quot;highly cinematic&quot; and &quot;a film studded with magnificent set-pieces&quot;.

The film has received praise from literary critics despite the many liberties it takes with the original play. The American literary critic Harold Bloom judged it &quot;the most successful film version of &quot;Macbeth&quot;&quot;. Sylvan Barnet writes it captured Macbeth as a strong warrior, and that &quot;Without worrying about fidelity to the original,&quot; &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; is &quot;much more satisfactory&quot; than most Shakespeare films. Film historian David A. Conrad wrote that just as Shakespeare&#x27;s play commented on &quot;questions of legitimacy, masculinity, and civil war&quot; that resonated in early 17th-century England, Kurosawa&#x27;s movie engages with contemporary Japanese debates about the &quot;spiderless cobweb&quot; of postwar bureaucracy and industry. In his &quot;Movie Guide&quot;, Leonard Maltin gave the film four stars, calling it a &quot;graphic, powerful adaptation&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Legacy==
Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1960 film &quot;The Bad Sleep Well&quot;, was heavily influenced by William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, as well as &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; by Alexandre Dumas. Roman Polanski&#x27;s 1971 film version of &quot;Macbeth&quot; has similarities to &quot;Throne of Blood&quot;, in shots of characters on twisted roads, set design, and music to identify locations and psychological conditions. Toshiro Mifune&#x27;s death scene was the source of inspiration for Piper Laurie&#x27;s death scene in the 1976 film &quot;Carrie&quot;, in which knives are thrown at her, in this case by character Carrie White using her psychic powers. In 1985, Kurosawa returned to adapting Shakespeare, choosing the play &quot;King Lear&quot; for his final epic film &quot;Ran&quot;, and again moving the setting to feudal Japan.

&quot;Throne of Blood&quot; is referenced in the anime film &quot;Millennium Actress&quot; (2001) in the form of the Forest Spirit/Witch. It was adapted for the stage by director Ping Chong, premiering at the 2010 Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon.

<doc id="102584" wikidata="Q49830" url="?curid=102584" title="Continental Reformed Protestantism">
<text>Continental Reformed Protestantism is a part of the Reformed tradition within Protestantism that traces its origin to continental Europe. Prominent subgroups are the Dutch Reformed, the Swiss Reformed, the French Huguenots, the Hungarian Reformed, the Waldensian Church in Italy, and reformed churches in Germany, which have long been united and mixed with Lutheran ones.

The term is used to distinguish these churches from Presbyterian, Congregational or other Calvinist churches, which can trace their origin to the British Isles or elsewhere in the world. Notably, their theology is largely derived from the Swiss Reformation, as Switzerland (specifically Geneva and Zürich) was a base for the most influential Reformed theologians of the era. It was inaugurated by Huldrych Zwingli, who formulated the first expression of the Reformed faith. Swiss Reformation was more fully articulated by Martin Bucer, Heinrich Bullinger and John Calvin. In the sixteenth century, the movement spread to most of continental Europe, sometimes with the protection of monarchs or members of the nobility, as in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Hungary, some German states, and France.

==History==

The first Calvinist churches were established in Europe after 1519 and were part of the Protestant Reformation. 

Calvinist doctrine is expressed in various confessions. A few confessions are shared by many denominations. Different denominations use different confessions, usually based on historical reasons. 

The continental Reformed churches had an impact on Anglicanism through the Puritans, who wished to reform the Church of England along continental lines.

The following is a chronological list of confession and theological doctrines of the Reformed churches:
*First Helvetic Confession (1536)
*Consensus Tigurinus (1549)
*French Confession (1559)
*Scots Confession (1560)
*Three forms of Unity
**Heidelberg Catechism (1563)
**Belgic Confession (1566)
**Canons of Dordrecht (1619)
*Second Helvetic Confession (1566)
*Helvetic Consensus (1675)
*Barmen Declaration (1934)

==Forms of government==
In contrast to the episcopal polity of the Anglican and many Lutheran and Methodist churches, Continental Reformed churches are ruled by assemblies of &quot;elders&quot; or ordained officers. This is usually called Synodal government by the Continental Reformed, but is essentially the same as presbyterian polity, with the elders forming the &quot;consistory&quot;, the regional governing body known as the &quot;classis&quot;, and the highest court of appeal being the &quot;general synod&quot;.

The Reformed Church in Hungary, its sister church in Romania, the Hungarian Reformed Church in America, and the Polish Reformed Church are the only continental Reformed churches to have retained the office of bishop.

==Calvinist churches worldwide==
Many churches in the Calvinist tradition spread either by European immigration, or European and North American missionary work.

<text>Julia Scarlett Elizabeth Louis-Dreyfus ( ; born January 13, 1961) is an American actress and comedian. Often described as one of the greatest performers in television history, she is widely known for her roles as various characters on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1982–1985), Elaine Benes on &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (1990–1998), Christine Campbell on &quot;The New Adventures of Old Christine&quot; (2006–2010), and Selina Meyer on &quot;Veep&quot; (2012–2019). Her list of accolades makes her one of the most award-winning actresses in American television history, and she has received more Primetime Emmy Awards and more Screen Actors Guild Awards than any other performer.

Louis-Dreyfus was born in New York City, the daughter of the French billionaire Gérard Louis-Dreyfus, and entered comedy as a performer with the Practical Theatre Company in Chicago. This led to her being cast in the sketch show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Her breakthrough came in 1990 with her debut at the start of a nine-season run on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, which became one of the most critically and commercially successful sitcoms. In addition to leading roles on &quot;The New Adventures of Old Christine&quot; and &quot;Veep&quot;, she has made guest appearances on shows such as &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, and &quot;30 Rock&quot;. On film, Louis-Dreyfus has had supporting film roles in &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989), &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; (1997), and &quot;You People&quot; (2023), and leading film roles in &quot;Enough Said&quot; (2013), &quot;Downhill&quot; (2020), &quot;You Hurt My Feelings&quot; (2023), and &quot;Tuesday&quot; (2023). Her voice acting work includes &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (1998), &quot;Planes&quot; (2013), and &quot;Onward&quot; (2020). Since 2021, she has played Valentina Allegra de Fontaine in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in three films and one Disney+ miniseries.

Louis-Dreyfus has received 11 Primetime Emmy Awards (eight for acting and three for producing) in addition to nine Screen Actors Guild Awards and one Golden Globe Award. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2010 and was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 2014. She was named as one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 most influential people in the world in 2016. She has also received numerous honors including the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2018 and the National Medal of Arts in 2021.

==Early life==
Julia Scarlett Elizabeth Louis-Dreyfus was born in New York City on January 13, 1961. Her mother, Judith (née LeFever), is an American writer and special needs educator. Her father, Gérard Louis-Dreyfus (1932–2016), was a French billionaire who served as chairman of the Louis Dreyfus Company. Her paternal grandfather, Pierre Louis-Dreyfus (1908–2011), was president of the Louis Dreyfus Group commodities and shipping conglomerate. He was a member of a Jewish family from Alsace, and served as a cavalry officer and member of the French Resistance during World War II. Louis-Dreyfus is the great-great-granddaughter of French businessman Léopold Louis-Dreyfus (1833–1915), founder of the Louis Dreyfus Group, which members of her family still control. She is the fifth cousin four times removed of Alfred Dreyfus (1859–1935) of the infamous Dreyfus affair. Robert Louis-Dreyfus (1946–2009), her father&#x27;s second cousin, was the CEO of Adidas and owner of the soccer team Olympique de Marseille. Julia&#x27;s paternal grandmother was the daughter of a Brazilian-Jewish father (whose family was Dutch, English, and Polish).

In 1962, a year after her birth, Louis-Dreyfus&#x27; parents divorced. She has said that she first noticed her penchant for comedy after sticking raisins up her nose at the age of three, which first made her mother laugh but then led to an emergency hospital visit. After moving to Washington, D.C., when Louis-Dreyfus was four, her mother married L. Thompson Bowles, dean of the George Washington University Medical School; Louis-Dreyfus gained a half-sister, Lauren Bowles, also an actress. Due to her stepfather&#x27;s work with Project HOPE, she spent her childhood in several U.S. states and countries such as Colombia, Sri Lanka, and Tunisia. In 1979, she graduated from the all-girls Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland. She later said of the school, &quot;There were things I did in school that, had there been boys in the classroom, I would have been less motivated to do. For instance, I was president of the honor society.&quot;

Louis-Dreyfus graduated from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in 1983, where she was a member of the Delta Gamma sorority. She studied theatre and performed in the Mee-Ow Show, a student-run improv and sketch comedy revue, before dropping out during her junior year to take a job at &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In 2007, she received an honorary doctor of arts degree from Northwestern University.

==Career==
===1982–1989: Early career and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===
As part of her comedic training, Louis-Dreyfus appeared in The Second City, one of the best-known improvisational theatre groups. It was her performance with The Practical Theatre Company at their &quot;Golden 50th Anniversary Jubilee&quot; that led to her being asked to join the cast of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; at the age of 21.

Louis-Dreyfus subsequently became a cast member on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1982 to 1985, the youngest female cast member in the history of the program at that time. It was during her third and final year on &quot;SNL&quot; that she met writer Larry David during his only year on the show. David later co-created &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. Louis-Dreyfus has commented that her casting on &quot;SNL&quot; was a &quot;Cinderella-getting-to-go-to-the-ball kind of experience&quot;; however, she has also admitted that at times it was often quite tense, stating that she &quot;didn&#x27;t know how to navigate the waters of show business in general and specifically doing a live sketch-comedy show&quot;.

Recurring characters on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;
* April May June, a televangelist
* Becky, El Dorko&#x27;s (Gary Kroeger) date
* Consuela, Chi Chi&#x27;s friend and co-host of &quot;Let&#x27;s Watch TV&quot;
* Darla in &quot;SNL&quot;″s parody of &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;
* Weather Woman, a superhero who controls the weather
* Patti Lynn Hunnsucker, a teenage correspondent on Weekend Update

Following her 1985 departure from &quot;SNL&quot;, Louis-Dreyfus appeared in several films, including &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986) by Woody Allen, &quot;Soul Man&quot; (1986), and &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989), in which she starred alongside fellow &quot;SNL&quot; alumnus Chevy Chase. In 1987, Louis-Dreyfus appeared in the NBC sitcom pilot &quot;The Art of Being Nick&quot;, an intended spin-off from &quot;Family Ties&quot; starring Scott Valentine. When the pilot did not make it to series, Louis-Dreyfus was retained by producer Gary David Goldberg for a role on his new sitcom &quot;Day by Day&quot;, as the sarcastic and materialistic neighbor, Eileen Swift. Premiering in early 1988, &quot;Day by Day&quot; aired for two seasons on NBC before being cancelled.

===1990–1998: &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and widespread recognition===

In the early 1990s, Louis-Dreyfus became famous for the role of Elaine Benes on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. She played the role for nine seasons, appearing in all but three episodes. One of the episodes that she did not appear in was the pilot episode, &quot;The Seinfeld Chronicles&quot;, because her character was not initially intended to be a part of the series. It was only after the first episode that NBC executives felt the show was too male-centric and demanded that creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld add a woman to the cast. It was revealed in the commentary on the DVD package that the addition of a female character was the condition for commissioning the show. Louis-Dreyfus won the role over several other actresses who also eventually enjoyed TV success, including Patricia Heaton and Megan Mullally. On the &quot;Notes About Nothing&quot; featurette on the DVD package, Seinfeld says that Louis-Dreyfus&#x27;s ability to eat a peanut M&amp;M without breaking the peanut described her: &quot;She cracks you up without breaking your nuts.&quot;

Louis-Dreyfus garnered critical acclaim for her performance on the series, and she was a regular winner and nominee at television award shows throughout the 1990s. Her performance earned her two Golden Globe Award nominations, winning once in 1994, nine Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, winning one in 1995 and two in both 1997 and 1998, and seven American Comedy Awards, winning five times in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1998. In 1996, she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, an award she was nominated for on seven occasions from 1992 to 1998. After receiving the award, Louis-Dreyfus said the win was a &quot;shocker&quot;, and that after being in both positions, it was &quot;much better to win than to lose.&quot;

In 1998, Jerry Seinfeld decided to end the series after nine seasons. The series finale aired on May 14 and was one of the most-watched TV events in history, with over 76 million viewers tuning in. During her time on &quot;Seinfeld,&quot; she appeared in several films, including the comedy films &quot;Fathers&#x27; Day&quot; (1997), opposite Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, and Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; (1997).

===1999–2004: Post-&quot;Seinfeld&quot;===
Following a voice role in the highly successful Pixar film &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (1998), Louis-Dreyfus lent her voice as Snake&#x27;s girlfriend Gloria in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love&quot;. In 2001, she made several special guest appearances on &quot;Seinfeld&quot; co-creator Larry David&#x27;s show &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, playing herself fictionally trying to break the &quot;curse&quot; by planning to star in a show in which she would play an actress affected by a &quot;Seinfeld&quot;-like curse.

After several years away from a regular TV job, Louis-Dreyfus began a new single-camera sitcom, &quot;Watching Ellie&quot;, which premiered on NBC in February 2002. The series was created by husband Brad Hall and co-starred Steve Carell and Louis-Dreyfus&#x27;s half-sister Lauren Bowles. The initial premise of the show was to present viewers with a &quot;slice of life&quot; from the goings-on and happenings of the life of Ellie Riggs, a Southern California jazz singer. The first season included a 22-minute countdown kept digitally in the lower left-hand corner of the screen, which many critics panned, claiming it was useless and &quot;did nothing for the show.&quot; Overall, the show received mixed reviews but debuted strongly with over 16 million viewers tuning in for the series premiere, and maintained an average audience of about 10 million viewers per week.

When the series returned for a second season in the spring of 2003, it suffered a decline in viewership, averaging around eight million viewers per week. The show had undergone a drastic stylistic change between the production of seasons one and two. The first season was filmed in the single-camera format, but the second season was presented as a traditional multicamera sitcom filmed in front of a live studio audience. With dwindling viewership and failing to retain the numbers from its &quot;Frasier&quot; lead-in, the series was cancelled by NBC in May 2003.

Following NBC&#x27;s cancellation of &quot;Watching Ellie&quot;, the media began circulating rumors of a so-called &quot;&quot;Seinfeld&quot; curse&quot;, which claimed that none of the former &quot;Seinfeld&quot; actors could ever achieve success again in the television industry. Louis-Dreyfus dismissed the rumor as &quot;a made-up thing by the media&quot;, while &quot;Seinfeld&quot; co-creator Larry David asserted that the curse was &quot;completely idiotic.&quot; Louis-Dreyfus was interested in the role of Susan Mayer on &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, the role that ultimately went to Teri Hatcher. Instead, Louis-Dreyfus scored a recurring guest role as Maggie Lizer, the deceitful prosecutor and love interest of Michael Bluth on the Emmy-winning comedy &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, from 2004 to 2005.

===2005–2010: &quot;The New Adventures of Old Christine&quot;===

In 2005, Louis-Dreyfus was cast in the title role of a new CBS sitcom, &quot;The New Adventures of Old Christine&quot;. The series and its concept were created by writer and producer of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, Kari Lizer. The series told the story of Christine Campbell, a single mother who manages to maintain a fantastic relationship with her ex-husband while running a women&#x27;s gym. The series debuted on CBS in March 2006 to an audience of 15 million and was initially a ratings winner for the network.

Louis-Dreyfus received considerable critical acclaim for her performance on the show, with Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; stating that Louis-Dreyfus broke the so-called &quot;&quot;Seinfeld&quot; curse [...] with one of the best conventional half-hours to come along in a while.&quot; Alessandra Stanley from &quot;The New York Times&quot; asserted that Louis-Dreyfus&#x27;s performance on the series proved she is &quot;one of the funniest women on network television.&quot; Louis-Dreyfus also earned the 2006 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance in the first season. Referring to the curse, she stated in her acceptance speech, &quot;I&#x27;m not somebody who really believes in curses, but curse this, baby!&quot; Throughout the course of the series, she received five consecutive Emmy Award nominations, three consecutive Satellite Award nominations, two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, and a nomination for a Golden Globe Award. In 2007, she also received two nominations for a People&#x27;s Choice Award due to her return to popularity, thanks to the success of &quot;Old Christine&quot;.

In May 2006, Louis-Dreyfus hosted an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, becoming the first female former cast member to return to the show as a host. In the episode, she appeared with her &quot;Seinfeld&quot; co-stars Jason Alexander and Jerry Seinfeld in her opening monologue, parodying the so-called &quot;&quot;Seinfeld&quot; curse&quot;. After a successful reception of her 2006 episode, Louis-Dreyfus again hosted &quot;SNL&quot; on March 17, 2007, and April 17, 2016. Louis-Dreyfus reprised her role as Gloria in two &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes: 2007&#x27;s &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; and 2008&#x27;s &quot;Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes&quot;. In the fall of 2009, she appeared with the rest of the cast of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; in four episodes of the seventh season of Larry David&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. The reunion shows received much media attention, and the episode received strong ratings for the series.
In 2009, Louis-Dreyfus was granted the honorary award for Legacy of Laughter at the TV Land Awards. Previous winners had included Lucille Ball and Mike Myers. She was presented with the award by friend Amy Poehler. The following year, Louis-Dreyfus received the 2,407th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on May 4, 2010, for her remarkable contribution to the broadcast television industry as both an actress and a comedian. Originally, the star was set with Louis-Dreyfus&#x27;s name spelled incorrectly. It was missing both the &#x27;o&#x27; and the hyphen in her last name. The star was corrected and the misspelled portion was removed and presented to her. Celebrity guests at the event included past and current colleagues from throughout her career, including Clark Gregg, Larry David, Eric McCormack, and Jason Alexander.

&quot;Old Christine&quot; was cancelled by CBS on May 18, 2010, after 5 years. Discussions were held with ABC to revive the show but the show was never revived. In the spring of 2010, Louis-Dreyfus guest-starred several times in the third season of the web series &quot;Web Therapy&quot;, starring Lisa Kudrow. Louis-Dreyfus played the sister of the main character, Fiona Wallice, who gives her therapy online. When the series made the transition to cable television on the Showtime network, Louis-Dreyfus&#x27;s appearance from the web series was included in the second season, airing in July 2012. In fall 2010, Louis-Dreyfus made a guest appearance on the live episode of &quot;30 Rock&quot;, playing Tina Fey&#x27;s role of Liz Lemon in the cutaway shots. Louis-Dreyfus was among several &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumni appearing in the episode, including Rachel Dratch, Bill Hader, and regulars Tracy Morgan and Fey herself. Louis-Dreyfus also starred in a &quot;Women of SNL&quot; special on November 1, 2010, on NBC.

===2011–2019: &quot;Veep&quot; and acclaim ===
In May and June 2011, Louis-Dreyfus teamed up with husband Brad Hall for her first short film, &quot;Picture Paris&quot;. This was the first time the couple had collaborated since their early-2000s NBC comedy &quot;Watching Ellie&quot;. Hall wrote and directed the film, while Louis-Dreyfus played the lead role of an ordinary woman with an extraordinary obsession with the city of Paris. The film premiered on January 29, 2012, at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, and has received considerable critical acclaim. It made its television premiere on HBO on December 17, 2012.
In early 2011, HBO confirmed that Louis-Dreyfus had been cast in the lead role of U.S. Vice President Selina Meyer in a new satirical comedy series titled &quot;Veep&quot;. The series was commissioned for a first season of eight episodes. In addition to her starring role, Louis-Dreyfus would also be a producer. In preparation for her role, Louis-Dreyfus spoke with Al Gore and another former vice president, senators, speechwriters, chiefs of staffs of various offices, and schedulers. Louis-Dreyfus commended HBO for allowing the cast and crew to engage in a &quot;protracted pre-production process&quot;, which included a six-week rehearsal period before filming began.

The first season was filmed in the fall of 2011, in Baltimore, and the series premiered on April 22, 2012. The premiere episode was met with high praise from critics, particularly for Louis-Dreyfus&#x27; performance. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; asserted the character of Selina Meyer was her &quot;best post-Seinfeld role&quot; to date and claimed she gives &quot;an Emmy-worthy effort&quot;, while the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; contended the series demonstrates she is &quot;one of the medium&#x27;s great comediennes.&quot; Following the success of the first season, Louis-Dreyfus was named by the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; as one of the funniest people of 2012, asserting that she is the &quot;most magnetic and naturally funny woman on TV since Mary Tyler Moore.&quot;
For her performance on &quot;Veep&quot;, Louis-Dreyfus received several accolades, most notably seven nominations for the Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series between 2012 and 2019, winning the award six times. These Emmy wins for &quot;Veep&quot;, following previous wins for &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;The New Adventures of Old Christine&quot;, resulted in her becoming the only woman to win an acting award for three separate comedy series. Her sixth win in 2016 surpassed the record previously held by Mary Tyler Moore and Candice Bergen for the most wins in that category. In 2017, her sixth consecutive win, and eighth acting win, overall made her the performer with the most Emmys for the same role in the same series, surpassing Candice Bergen and Don Knotts, and put her in a tie with Cloris Leachman for the most Emmys ever won by a performer. She was also nominated as one of the producers for &quot;Veep&quot; in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series category for all seven seasons, winning the award in 2015, 2016 and 2017 for the fourth, fifth and sixth seasons respectively. Louis-Dreyfus also received five Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award nominations, winning twice in 2013 and 2014, ten Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, winning twice in 2014 and 2017, and five Television Critics Association Award nominations, winning once in 2014. Her performance additionally garnered her five Satellite Award nominations and five consecutive Golden Globe Award nominations.
Louis-Dreyfus lent her voice to the 2013 animated film &quot;Planes&quot;, in the role of Rochelle. To date, the film has grossed well over $200 million at the box office worldwide. She also starred in the film &quot;Enough Said&quot;, directed by Nicole Holofcener, which was released on September 18, 2013. This marked her debut as a lead actress in a full-length feature film. The film garnered rave reviews from film critics, ranking among the best-reviewed films of 2013. The website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 96% based on 152 reviews, many of them praising Louis-Dreyfus&#x27;s performance. She received several Best Actress nominations including for the Golden Globe Awards and the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards. Another review aggregation website, Metacritic, gave the film a score of 78 out of 100, based on 44 critics, signifying &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Since December 2014, Louis-Dreyfus has appeared in a series of television commercials for Old Navy. In 2015 she acted in the Comedy Central sketch series &quot;Inside Amy Schumer&quot; alongside Tina Fey and Patricia Arquette, playing a version of themselves giving advice on aging to Amy Schumer. Dreyfus said of the experience &quot;I started to feel unbelievably paranoid that I was making fun of myself and wondering, was this really happening to me? Like, how meta is this moment in my life? I started to have a kind of soul-searching crisis in the middle of the day. And I didn&#x27;t know [the other women] well enough to bring it up, so I was just trying to be a good sport even though I was dying a little bit on the inside.&quot; On April 16, 2016, she returned to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; serving as host for the third time with musical guest Nick Jonas. During the episode&#x27;s cold open, she reprised her role of Elaine Benes from &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.

She also starred in the A24 film &quot;Tuesday&quot;, directed by Daina Oniunas-Pusić, which premiered at the 2023 Telluride Film Festival.

== Reception ==
Louis-Dreyfus is widely regarded as one of the finest comedic actresses of her generation. Jake Coyle of the &quot;Lubbock Avalanche-Journal&quot; said &quot;Few comediennes have both her gift for physical comedy... and vocal precision&quot;. According to the journalist Molly Ball, Louis-Dreyfus has played mostly &quot;funny, self-centered women who are compelling despite often being ill-behaved.&quot; Louis-Dreyfus said she had turned playing unlikeable people into a career. Ball said: &quot;She has also left an indelible cultural mark, expanding the possibilities for women in comedy–and maybe in politics and public life as well.&quot;

She said: &quot;One in eight women get breast cancer. Today, I&#x27;m the one. The good news is that I have the most glorious group of supportive and caring family and friends, and fantastic insurance through my union. The bad news is that not all women are so lucky, so let&#x27;s fight all cancers and make universal healthcare a reality.&quot; On October 18, 2018, she announced on an episode of &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; that she was cancer-free.

Louis-Dreyfus was raised Catholic but moved towards agnosticism; she said she had no &quot;traditional religious affiliation&quot;.

<doc id="102593" wikidata="Q228503" url="?curid=102593" title="Uninflected word">
<text>In linguistic morphology, an uninflected word is a word that has no morphological markers (inflection) such as affixes, ablaut, consonant gradation, etc., indicating declension or conjugation. If a word has an uninflected form, this is usually the form used as the lemma for the word.

In English and many other languages, uninflected words include prepositions, interjections, and conjunctions, often called invariable words. These cannot be inflected under any circumstances (unless they are used as different parts of speech, as in &quot;ifs and buts&quot;).

Only words that cannot be inflected at all are called &quot;invariable&quot;. In the strict sense of the term &quot;uninflected&quot;, only invariable words are uninflected, but in broader linguistic usage, these terms are extended to be inflectable words that appear in their basic form. For example, English nouns are said to be uninflected in the singular, while they show inflection in the plural (represented by the affix &quot;-s/-es&quot;). The term &quot;uninflected&quot; can also refer to uninflectability with respect to one or more, but not all, morphological features; for example, one can say that Japanese verbs are uninflected for person and number, but they do inflect for tense, politeness, and several moods and aspects.

In the strict sense, among English nouns only mass nouns (such as &quot;sand&quot;, &quot;information&quot;, or &quot;equipment&quot;) are truly uninflected, since they have only one form that does not change; count nouns are always inflected for number, even if the singular inflection is shown by an &quot;invisible&quot; affix (the null morpheme). In the same way, English verbs are inflected for person and tense even if the morphology showing those categories is realized as null morphemes. In contrast, other analytic languages like Mandarin Chinese have true uninflected nouns and verbs, where the notions of number and tense are completely absent. 

In many inflected languages, such as Greek and Russian, some nouns and adjectives of foreign origin are left uninflected in contexts where native words would be inflected; for instance, the name &quot;Abraam&quot; in Greek (from Hebrew), the Modern Greek word μπλε &quot;ble&quot; (from French &quot;bleu&quot;), the Italian word &quot;computer&quot;, and the Russian words , (kangaroo) and , (coat, from French &quot;paletot&quot;).

In German, all modal particles are uninflected.

<text>Alan LaVern Bean (March 15, 1932 – May 26, 2018) was an American naval officer and aviator, aeronautical engineer, test pilot, NASA astronaut and painter. He was selected to become an astronaut by NASA in 1963 as part of Astronaut Group 3, and was the fourth person to walk on the Moon.

Before becoming an astronaut, Bean graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from University of Texas at Austin in 1955 and re-joined the U.S. Navy—he served as an enlisted member for a year after his high school graduation. He received his naval aviator wings in 1956 and served as a fighter pilot. In 1960, he graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, flew as a test pilot and was The New Nine selection finalist in 1962.

Bean made his first flight into space aboard Apollo 12 in November 1969, the second crewed mission to land on the Moon. He spent over seven hours walking on the Moon during two lunar excursions. He made his second and final flight into space on the Skylab 3 mission in 1973, the second crewed mission to the Skylab space station. 

After retiring from the United States Navy in 1975 and NASA in 1981, Bean pursued his interest in painting, depicting various space-related scenes and documenting his own experiences in space as well as those of his fellow Apollo program astronauts. He was the last living crew member of Apollo 12.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Bean was born March 15, 1932, in Wheeler, the seat of Wheeler County in the northeastern Texas Panhandle, to parents Arnold Horace Bean and Frances Caroline Bean ( Murphy), who lived from 1908 to 1983, and 1906 to 1981, respectively. He considered Fort Worth his hometown. He was of Scottish descent. As a boy, he lived in Minden, the seat of Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana, where his father worked for the U.S. Soil Conservation Service. Bean was a Boy Scout and he earned the rank of First Class. He graduated from R. L. Paschal High School in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1949. Following his high school graduation in 1949, Bean enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve.

Bean received a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 1955, where he attended on a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) scholarship. While at the university, he also joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.

===Military service===
He was an Electronics Technician Striker at the NAS Dallas, Texas, until September 1950, when he was honorably discharged. In January 1955, Bean was commissioned a U.S. Navy ensign through the NROTC at the University of Texas at Austin, and attended flight training. After completing flight training in June 1956, he was assigned to Attack Squadron 44 (VA-44) at NAS Jacksonville, Florida, from 1956 to 1960, flying the F9F Cougar and A4D Skyhawk. After a four-year tour of duty, he attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School (USNTPS) at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, where his instructor was his future Apollo 12 Commander, Pete Conrad, graduating in November 1960. Bean took art classes at St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland during this tour, and flew as a test pilot on several types of naval aircraft. Following his assignment at USNTPS and aviation safety training with the University of Southern California (USC), he went through additional instruction with his old Attack Squadron 44, and was assigned to Navy Attack Squadron VA-172 at NAS Cecil Field, Florida, flying the A-4 Skyhawks, during which time he was selected as a NASA astronaut.

Bean logged more than 7,145 hours of flying time, including 4,890 hours in jet aircraft.

===NASA career===
Bean was selected by NASA as part of Astronaut Group 3 in 1963 (after not being selected for Astronaut Group 2 the previous year). He was selected to be the backup command pilot for Gemini 10, but was unsuccessful in securing an early Apollo flight assignment. He was placed in the Apollo Applications Program in the interim. In that capacity, he was the first astronaut to dive in the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator and a champion of the process for astronaut training. When fellow astronaut Clifton Williams was killed in an air crash, a space was opened for Bean on the backup crew for Apollo 9. Apollo 12 Commander Conrad, who had instructed Bean at the Naval Test Pilot School years before, personally requested Bean to replace Williams.

====Apollo program====

Bean was the Apollo Lunar Module pilot on Apollo 12, the second lunar landing. In November 1969, Bean and Pete Conrad landed on the Moon&#x27;s Ocean of Storms—after a flight of 250,000 miles and a launch that included a harrowing lightning strike. He was the astronaut who executed John Aaron&#x27;s &quot;Flight, try SCE to &#x27;Aux&#x27;&quot; instruction to restore telemetry after the spacecraft was struck by lightning 36 seconds after launch, thus salvaging the mission. They explored the lunar surface, deployed several lunar surface experiments, and installed the first nuclear power generator station on the Moon to provide the power source. Dick Gordon remained in lunar orbit, photographing landing sites for future missions.

Bean had planned on using a self-timer for his Hasselblad camera to take a photograph of both Pete Conrad and himself while on the lunar surface near the Surveyor III spacecraft. He was hoping to record a good photo, and also to confuse the mission scientists as to how the photo could have been taken. However, neither he nor Conrad could locate the timer in the tool carrier tote bag while at the Surveyor III site, thus lost the opportunity. After finding the self-timer unit at the end of the EVA, when it was too late to use, he threw it as far as he could. His paintings of what this photo would have looked like (titled &quot;The Fabulous Photo We Never Took&quot;) and one of his fruitless search for the timer (&quot;Our Little Secret&quot;) are included in his collection of Apollo paintings.

Bean&#x27;s suit is on display in the National Air and Space Museum.

====Skylab====
Bean was the spacecraft commander of Skylab 3, the second crewed mission to Skylab, from July 29 to September 25, 1973. With him on the mission were scientist-astronaut Owen Garriott and Marine Corps Colonel Jack R. Lousma. Bean and his crew were on Skylab for 59 days, during which time they covered a world-record-setting 24.4 million miles. During the mission, Bean tested a prototype of the Manned Maneuvering Unit and performed one spacewalk outside the Skylab. The crew of Skylab 3 accomplished 150% of its mission goals.

===Post-NASA career===

On his next assignment, Bean was the backup spacecraft commander of the United States flight crew for the joint American-Russian Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.

Bean retired from the Navy in October 1975 as a captain, and continued as head of the Astronaut Candidate Operations and Training Group within the Astronaut Office in a civilian capacity.

Bean logged 1,671 hours and 45 minutes in space while at NASA, of which 10 hours and 26 minutes were spent in EVAs on the Moon and in Earth orbit.

==Painting==
Bean resigned from NASA in June 1981 to devote his time to painting. He said his decision was based on that, in his 18 years as an astronaut, he was fortunate enough to visit worlds and see sights no artist&#x27;s eye, past or present, has ever viewed firsthand and he hoped to express these experiences through his art.

As a painter, Bean wanted to add color to the Moon. &quot;I had to figure out a way to add color to the Moon without ruining it,&quot; he remarked. In his paintings, the lunar landscape is not a monotonous gray, but shades of various colors. &quot;If I were a scientist painting the Moon, I would paint it gray. I&#x27;m an artist, so I can add colors to the Moon&quot;, said Bean.

Bean&#x27;s paintings include &quot;Lunar Grand Prix&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll on the Ocean of Storms&quot;, and he used real Moon dust in his paintings. When he began painting, he realized that keepsake patches from his space suit were dirty with Moon dust. He added tiny pieces of the patches to his paintings, which made them unique. He also used a hammer, used to pound the flagpole into the lunar surface, and a bronzed Moon boot to texture his paintings.

In July 2009, for the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, Bean exhibited his lunar paintings at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum in Washington.

==Personal life and death==
Bean took a piece of Clan MacBean tartan to the Moon. In recognition of his Scottish ancestry, Bean stated:
He married Sue Ragsdale, a fellow graduate of the University of Texas on April 19, 1955, shortly before her graduation. With Ragsdale, Bean had a son, Clay, and a daughter, Amy Sue. 

Bean died on May 26, 2018, in Houston, Texas, at the age of 86. His death followed the sudden onset of illness two weeks before while he was in Fort Wayne, Indiana. At the time of his death, Bean was married to his second wife, Leslie, and was also survived by his sister, Paula Scott.

Bean was interred in Arlington National Cemetery on November 8, 2018.

== Legacy ==
He was awarded with several awards and decorations during his career. He received the Rear Admiral William S. Parsons Award for Scientific and Technical Progress, the Godfrey L. Cabot Award for 1970, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Trustees Award, the V. M. Komarov Diploma for 1973 and the AAS Flight Achievement Award for 1974.

Bean received the Navy Astronaut Wings, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal (twice), the NASA Distinguished Service Medal (twice), and the National Defense Service Medal with bronze star.

Bean was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983, the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997, the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame in 2010, and the National Aviation Hall of Fame for 2010. He was also a fellow of the American Astronautical Society and a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots.

Bean received the University of Texas Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1970 and the Distinguished Engineering Graduate Award. Bean, the first Texan to walk on the Moon, was awarded the Texas Press Associations Texan of the Year Award for 1969. The 1973 Robert J. Collier Trophy was awarded to NASA and the Skylab crew. Bean was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Texas Wesleyan College in 1972, and was presented an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering Science degree from the University of Akron (Ohio) in 1974. The city of Chicago held a parade and presented gold medals to the Skylab astronauts in 1974. Bean was the recipient of Fédération Aéronautique Internationale&#x27;s prestigious Yuri Gagarin Gold Medal for 1973 in Sydney, Australia. In 1975, President Ford presented Skylab commander Gerald Carr with the Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy at a White House ceremony, on behalf of all Skylab astronauts (including Bean). Bean was a co-recipient of AIAA&#x27;s Octave Chanute Award for 1975, along with fellow Skylab 3 astronauts Jack Lousma and Owen Garriott. In 2019, Northrop Grumman named the spacecraft for the NG-12 mission the &quot;S.S. Alan Bean&quot;.

==In media==
In the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, Bean was portrayed by Dave Foley. Swedish indie pop artist Stina Nordenstam has a song called &quot;The Return of Alan Bean&quot; on her 1991 debut album &quot;Memories of a Color&quot;. British indie rock band Hefner released a single called &quot;Alan Bean&quot; in 2001, writing from the perspective of Bean during Apollo 12. For her 2019 novel, &quot;America Was Hard to Find&quot;, American writer Kathleen Alcott based her description of the Apollo landing on interviews she conducted with Bean.

<text>The charge at Krojanty, battle of Krojanty, the riding of Krojanty or skirmish of Krojanty was a Polish cavalry charge on the evening of 1 September 1939, the first day of the Second World War, near the Pomeranian village of Krojanty. It occurred at the start of the invasion of Poland and was part of the larger Battle of Tuchola Forest. Polish soldiers advanced east along the railway to a railroad crossroads from the town of Chojnice, where elements of the Polish cavalry charged and dispersed a German infantry battalion. Machine gun fire from German armoured cars that appeared from a nearby forest forced the Poles to retreat. However, the attack delayed the German advance, allowing the Polish 1st Rifle Battalion and Czersk Operational Group to withdraw safely.

The incident prompted false reports of Polish cavalry attacking German tanks, after journalists saw the bodies of horses and cavalrymen. Nazi propaganda took advantage to suggest that the Poles attacked intentionally since they had believed the Germans still had the dummy tanks permitted by the Versailles Treaty&#x27;s restrictions. The scene of the Polish cavalry charging panzers with lances remains a common myth.

== Before the battle ==
Polish units were engaged in battle from 05:00 against elements of German 76th Infantry Regiment (Colonel Hans Gollnick) of 20th Motorised Division under Lt. Gen. Mauritz von Wiktorin, which operated on the left (northern) flank of XIX Panzer Corps under Gen. Heinz Guderian. Early in the day, Polish cavalry had intercepted German infantry moving towards the Free City of Danzig (Gdańsk) and slowed their progress.

At 08:00, the Germans broke through Polish Border Guard units south of the Polish cavalry, which forced the Polish units in the area to start a retreat towards a secondary defence line at the Brda river. The 18th Pomeranian Uhlan Regiment was ordered to cover the retreat.

== The battle ==

The 18th Pomeranian Uhlans spotted a group of German infantry resting in a clearing in the Tuchola Forest heath near the railroad crossroads of Chojnice–Runowo Pomorskie line.

Colonel Kazimierz Mastalerz decided to take the enemy by surprise and ordered Eugeniusz Świeściak, commander of the 1st squadron, to execute a cavalry charge at 1900 hours, leading two squadrons, about 250 strong. Most of the two other squadrons, and their TKS/TK3 tankettes, were held back in reserve.

The charge was successful: the German infantry unit was dispersed, and the Poles occupied the clearing. However, German armored reconnaissance vehicles appeared from the forest road, probably part of &quot;Aufklärungs-Abteilung 20&quot;, and soon the Polish units came under heavy machine gun fire, probably from Leichter Panzerspähwagen equipped with MG 34, or Schwerer Panzerspähwagen equipped also with a 20 mm gun. The Poles were completely exposed and began to gallop for cover behind a nearby hillock.

Commander Świeściak was killed, as was Mastalerz, who tried to save him. About a third of the Polish force was dead or wounded. On the other hand, the German advance was halted long enough to allow the withdrawal of Polish 1st Rifle battalion and National Defence battalion &quot;Czersk&quot; from the nearby battle of Chojnice.

The Polish cavalry charge impressed the Germans and caused a delay in the offensive of the German 20th Motorised Infantry Division which considered a tactical retreat. This was however prevented by personal intervention of Gen. Guderian, who in his memoirs stated that he encountered his staff &quot;wearing helmets, preparing an anti-tank gun for a possible Polish cavalry attack,&quot; and that &quot;the panic of the first day of war was overcome quickly&quot;.
== Aftermath and myth ==
The Polish cavalry charge stopped the German pursuit for the day, and the units of Czersk Operational Group were able to withdraw southwards unopposed. Also, it took the Germans several hours to reorganise and continue the advance. On 2 September 1939 the 18th Pomeranian Uhlans Regiment was decorated by General Stanisław Grzmot-Skotnicki, the commander of the Operational Group, with his own Virtuti Militari medal for valour shown in combat.

The same day, German war correspondents were brought to the battlefield, together with two journalists from Italy. They were shown the corpses of Polish cavalrymen and their horses as well as German tanks that had arrived after the battle. One of the Italian correspondents, Indro Montanelli, sent home an article in which he described the bravery and heroism of Polish soldiers, who charged German tanks with sabres and lances. Although such a charge did not happen, and there were no tanks used during combat, the myth was used in German propaganda during the war. German propaganda magazine &quot;Die Wehrmacht&quot; reported on 13 September that the Poles had gravely underestimated German weapons, as Polish propaganda had suggested that German armoured vehicles were covered only with sheet metal, which led to a grotesque attack.

One writer said:
The Poles had anti-tank weapons, including the anti-tank rifle model 1935 7.92 mm (Wz. 35 anti-tank rifle). It could penetrate 15 mm of armour at 300 m at 30 degrees. In 1939, the Germans were equipped mainly with the small Panzer I and Panzer II models, which were vulnerable to such weapons.

<doc id="102600" wikidata="Q1349650" url="?curid=102600" title="RC5">
<text>In cryptography, RC5 is a symmetric-key block cipher notable for its simplicity. Designed by Ronald Rivest in 1994, &quot;RC&quot; stands for &quot;Rivest Cipher&quot;, or alternatively, &quot;Ron&#x27;s Code&quot; (compare RC2 and RC4). The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) candidate RC6 was based on RC5.

==Description==
Unlike many schemes, RC5 has a variable block size (32, 64 or 128 bits), key size (0 to 2040 bits), and number of rounds (0 to 255). The original suggested choice of parameters were a block size of 64 bits, a 128-bit key, and 12 rounds.

A key feature of RC5 is the use of data-dependent rotations; one of the goals of RC5 was to prompt the study and evaluation of such operations as a cryptographic primitive. RC5 also consists of a number of modular additions and eXclusive OR (XOR)s. The general structure of the algorithm is a Feistel-like network, similar to RC2. The encryption and decryption routines can be specified in a few lines of code. The key schedule, however, is more complex, expanding the key using an essentially one-way function with the binary expansions of both e and the golden ratio as sources of &quot;nothing up my sleeve numbers&quot;. The tantalising simplicity of the algorithm together with the novelty of the data-dependent rotations has made RC5 an attractive object of study for cryptanalysts.
RC5 is basically denoted as RC5-w/r/b where w=word size in bits, r=number of rounds, b=number of bytes in the key.

==Algorithm==

RC5 encryption and decryption both expand the random key into 2(r+1) words that will be used sequentially (and only once each) during the encryption and decryption processes. All of the below comes from Rivest&#x27;s revised paper on RC5.

===Key expansion===

The key expansion algorithm is illustrated below, first in pseudocode, then example C code copied directly from the reference paper&#x27;s appendix.

Following the naming scheme of the paper, the following variable names are used:
* – The length of a word in bits, typically 16, 32 or 64. Encryption is done in 2-word blocks.
* – The length of a word in bytes.
* – The length of the key in bytes.
* – The key, considered as an array of bytes (using 0-based indexing).
* – The length of the key in words (or 1, if b = 0).
* – A temporary working array used during key scheduling, initialized to the key in words.
* – The number of rounds to use when encrypting data.
* – the number of round subkeys required.
* – The round subkey words.
* – The first magic constant, defined as , where is the nearest odd integer to the given input, is the base of the natural logarithm, and is defined above. For common values of , the associated values of are given here in hexadecimal:
** For &quot;w&quot; = 16: 0xB7E1
** For &quot;w&quot; = 32: 0xB7E15163
** For &quot;w&quot; = 64: 0xB7E151628AED2A6B
* – The second magic constant, defined as , where is the nearest odd integer to the given input, where is the golden ratio, and is defined above. For common values of , the associated values of are given here in hexadecimal:
** For &quot;w&quot; = 16: 0x9E37
** For &quot;w&quot; = 32: 0x9E3779B9
** For &quot;w&quot; = 64: 0x9E3779B97F4A7C15
# Break K into words
# u = w / 8
c = ceiling(max(b, 1) / u)
# L is initially a c-length list of 0-valued w-length words
for i = b-1 down to 0 do:
 L[i / u] = (L[i / u] «&lt; 8) + K[i]
# Initialize key-independent pseudorandom S array
# S is initially a t=2(r+1) length list of undefined w-length words
S[0] = P_w
for i = 1 to t-1 do:
 S[i] = S[i - 1] + Q_w
# The main key scheduling loop
i = j = 0
A = B = 0
do 3 * max(t, c) times:
 A = S[i] = (S[i] + A + B) «&lt; 3
 B = L[j] = (L[j] + A + B) «&lt; (A + B)
 i = (i + 1) % t
 j = (j + 1) % c

# return S
The example source code is provided from the appendix of Rivest&#x27;s paper on RC5. The implementation is designed to work with w = 32, r = 12, and b = 16.
void RC5_SETUP(unsigned char *K)
 // w = 32, r = 12, b = 16
 // c = max(1, ceil(8 * b/w))
 // t = 2 * (r+1)
 WORD i, j, k, u = w/8, A, B, L[c];
 for (i = b-1, L[c-1] = 0; i != -1; i--)
 L[i/u] = (L[i/u] « 8) + K[i];
 for (S[0] = P, i = 1; i &lt; t; i++)
 S[i] = S[i-1] + Q;
 for (A = B = i = j = k = 0; k &lt; 3 * t; k++, i = (i+1) % t, j = (j+1) % c)
 A = S[i] = ROTL(S[i] + (A + B), 3);
 B = L[j] = ROTL(L[j] + (A + B), (A + B));
}
===Encryption===

Encryption involved several rounds of a simple function, with 12 or 20 rounds seemingly recommended, depending on security needs and time considerations. Beyond the variables used above, the following variables are used in this algorithm:

* A, B - The two words composing the block of plaintext to be encrypted.
A = A + S[0]
B = B + S[1]
for i = 1 to r do:
 A = ((A ^ B) «&lt; B) + S[2 * i]
 B = ((B ^ A) «&lt; A) + S[2 * i + 1]

# The ciphertext block consists of the two-word wide block composed of A and B, in that order.
return A, B
The example C code given by Rivest is this.
void RC5_ENCRYPT(WORD *pt, WORD *ct)
 WORD i, A = pt[0] + S[0], B = pt[1] + S[1];
 for (i = 1; i &lt;= r; i++)
 A = ROTL(A ^ B, B) + S[2*i];
 B = ROTL(B ^ A, A) + S[2*i + 1];
 ct[0] = A; ct[1] = B;


===Decryption===

Decryption is a fairly straightforward reversal of the encryption process. The below pseudocode shows the process.
for i = r down to 1 do:
 B = ((B - S[2 * i + 1]) »&gt; A) ^ A
 A = ((A - S[2 * i]) »&gt; B) ^ B
B = B - S[1]
A = A - S[0]

return A, B
The example C code given by Rivest is this.
void RC5_DECRYPT(WORD *ct, WORD *pt)
 WORD i, B=ct[1], A=ct[0];
 for (i = r; i &gt; 0; i--)
 B = ROTR(B - S[2*i + 1], A) ^ A;
 A = ROTR(A - S[2*i], B) ^ B;
 
 pt[1] = B - S[1]; pt[0] = A - S[0];


==Cryptanalysis==
Twelve-round RC5 (with 64-bit blocks) is susceptible to a differential attack using 244 chosen plaintexts. 18–20 rounds are suggested as sufficient protection.

A number of these challenge problems have been tackled using distributed computing, organised by Distributed.net. Distributed.net has brute-forced RC5 messages encrypted with 56-bit and 64-bit keys and has been working on cracking a 72-bit key since November 3, 2002. As of July 26, 2023, 10.409% of the keyspace has been searched and based on the rate recorded that day, it would take a little more than 59 years to complete 100% of the keyspace. The task has inspired many new and novel developments in the field of cluster computing.

RSA Security, which had a (now expired) patent on the algorithm, offered a series of US$10,000 prizes for breaking ciphertexts encrypted with RC5, but these contests were discontinued as of May 2007. As a result, distributed.net decided to fund the monetary prize. The individual who discovers the winning key will receive US$1,000, their team (if applicable) will receive US$1,000, and the Free Software Foundation will receive US$2,000.

<text>The Harvard Bridge (also known locally as the MIT Bridge, the Massachusetts Avenue Bridge, and the &quot;Mass. Ave.&quot; Bridge) is a steel haunched girder bridge carrying Massachusetts Avenue (Route 2A) over the Charles River and connecting Back Bay, Boston with Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is the longest bridge over the Charles River at .

After years of disagreement between the cities of Boston and Cambridge, the bridge was built jointly by the two cities between 1887 and 1891. It was named for Harvard University founder John Harvard. Originally equipped with a central swing span, it was revised several times over the years until its superstructure was completely replaced in the late 1980s due to unacceptable vibration and the collapse of a similar bridge in Connecticut.

The bridge is known locally for being marked off in the idiosyncratic unit of length called the smoot.

==Conception==
In 1874 the Massachusetts Legislature authorized construction of a bridge between Boston and Cambridge, and in 1882 follow-up legislation set out its location.

The bridge was to have a draw with an opening of at least . Boston interests opposed the bridge, mainly because it did not provide for an overhead crossing of the Grand Junction Branch of the Boston and Albany Railroad. Further legislation in 1885 changed the draw to a clear opening of at least and no more, until the other bridges below the proposed location were required to have a larger opening. There was still no substantive progress until 1887, when Cambridge petitioned the Legislature to compel Boston to proceed; the resulting act required each city pay half the cost, and allowed Boston to raise up to $250,000 (US$ with inflation) for this purpose, in excess of its debt limit. This implied an estimated cost of US$500,000 (US$ with inflation) for the bridge.

The Legislature provided for a bridge commission, to consist of the mayors of Boston and Cambridge plus a third commissioner to be appointed by the mayors. The mayors of Boston and Cambridge, Hugh O&#x27;Brien and William E. Russell, appointed Leander Greeley of Cambridge as the third commissioner, though this appointment changed over time.

The commission&#x27;s 1892 report claimed:

===Name===
The bridge is named for the Reverend John Harvard, for whom Harvard University is also named, rather than for the university itself. Other names suggested included Blaxton, Chester, Shawmut, and Longfellow.

==Engineering==

Originally projected as a wooden pile structure with stone pavement for the first (because the Charles River Embankment extension was expected to take that space) the design was changed to be entirely iron spans on stone piers. The general plans were approved on July 14, 1887. The engineers were William Jackson (Boston City Engineer), John E. Cheney (assistant Boston City Engineer), Samuel E. Tinkham (assistant engineer), and Nathan S. Brock (assistant engineer at bridge).

The subsurface conditions at the bridge location are extreme. Much of Boston is underlain with clay, but the situation at the bridge is exacerbated by a fault which roughly follows the path of the Charles River itself. From a depth of approximately below existing ground, is a very dense till composed of gravel and boulders with a silt-clay matrix. Above that to approximately below the surface is Boston blue clay (BBC). Over this are thin layers of sand, gravel, and fill. The BBC is overconsolidated up to a depth of approximately .

The substructure originally consisted of two masonry abutments and twenty-three masonry piers, as well as one pile foundation with a fender pier for the draw span. The superstructure was originally twenty-three cantilevered fixed spans and suspended spans, of plate girders with one swing span. The Boston abutment rests on vertical piles, while the Cambridge end is directly on gravel.

Originally, the bridge was built across the Charles River connecting West Chester Park, in Boston, with Front Street, in Cambridge. This is now called Massachusetts Avenue on both sides of the river. As originally built, the total length between centers of bearings on abutments was with a draw wide between centers. The width of the bridge was except near and on the draw.

The bridge as built was composed of fixed and suspended spans roughly long and piers apart, center to center. The span lengths alternated between . The longer spans were cantilevered, while the shorter spans were suspended between the cantilevers.

The original roadway contained two lanes for horse-drawn vehicles and two street car tracks, for a total width of . There were also two sidewalks. The original roadway and sidewalk stringers were of wood, with an approximately thick covering of asphalt on the sidewalk and a spruce wearing surface on the roadway.

The exception was at the swing span, which was wide. This span was approximately long, and sat on a wooden pier. It was a double-cantilevered, electrically-driven structure also carrying a bridge caretaker&#x27;s house.

The bridge opened on September 1, 1891. The original cost of construction was $511,000, $ in current dollars.

==Maintenance and events==
In 1898, bicycle lanes were installed next to each curb. In 2011 (113 years later), the City of Boston finally connected these lanes to its own bike lanes.

A marker near the southeast end of the bridge memorializes one of Harry Houdini&#x27;s &quot;well known escapes&quot;, during which he jumped from the bridge on May 1, 1908. (Other sources give the date as April 30, 1908.)

The bridge was declared unsafe in 1909, requiring all of the iron and steel to be replaced. The draw was elevated slightly and the trolley rails were replaced as well.

When the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) took control of the bridge in 1924, they rebuilt much of the bridge superstructure. They replaced the wooden stringers with steel &quot;I&quot; beams, topped wooden deck elements with concrete and brick, and replaced the street car rails. Structural steel hangers replaced wrought iron. The swing span was converted into two fixed spans the same width as the rest of the bridge. The wooden pier was heavily modified with concrete and stone to make it resemble the other piers, increasing the number of stone piers from 23 to 24.

Heavy traffic at the Mass Ave and Memorial Drive intersection on the Cambridge end of the bridge led to the construction of an underpass in 1931.

The bridge was formerly referred to as the &quot;Xylophone Bridge&quot; because of the sound its wooden decking made when traffic traveled over it. This decking was replaced in 1949 with concrete-filled &quot;I-beam lok&quot; grating topped with a thick bituminous wearing surface. At this time, all bearings were replaced, and the trolley car tracks were removed, as were granite blocks. The trolley car poles were reused for street lights. Ramps between the bridge and the under-construction Storrow Drive were added.

The 1924 sidewalk slabs were replaced by precast, prestressed slabs in 1962. The fifteen expansion dams were replaced or repaired in 1969.

===Engineering study, 1971–1972===

An engineering study was performed by the Metropolitan District Commission (later merged into the Department of Conservation and Recreation) in 1971–1972 due to complaints by bridge users of excessive vibration. The bridge was found to be understrength for its load. Before the final study was complete, the recommendation was to place a load limit of per axle and a total of per vehicle, or to restrict trucks to the interior lanes, where the bridge was stronger. A limit was imposed.

Suggestions made included strengthening the existing structure by adding either struts or plates to make the existing four beams along the length of the bridge into a stiffening truss, or to replace the superstructure with a new one, made of either steel or concrete, which would be up to current standards. The recommendation was to replace the superstructure with one weighing approximately the same in order to reuse the piers, which were in good condition.

The reasoning was that the cost of a new structure could be predicted much more easily than the cost of repairing and reinforcing the existing bridge. The resulting new bridge would be of known materials and quality, such as ductile structural steel rather than brittle wrought iron, and rated at AASHO HS-20. Repairing the existing structure would leave old wrought iron of uncertain quality and condition standing, and would not bring the design up to (then) current standards. Detailed engineering calculations were included. The price was estimated at US$2.5 million to US$3 million (US$ to US$ with inflation).

The action taken based on this study was to establish load restrictions on the bridge, in the outer lanes, on the inner lanes. This was expanded in 1979 to a flat limit of on the whole bridge.

===Superstructure replacement, 1980s===
After the failure of the Mianus River Bridge at Greenwich, Connecticut in 1983, the Harvard Bridge was shut down and inspected because it contained similar elements, specifically the suspended spans. Traffic was restricted to the inner two lanes due to the discovery of two failed hangers on span 14. A few days later, all trucks and buses were banned from the bridge.

In 1986, a report was published containing the plan to replace the superstructure on the existing supports. Alternatives considered were very similar to the 1972 report, and were similarly decided. Structural modifications included an upgrade from four longitudinal girders to six of the same shape and replacement of a stairway with a handicapped pedestrian ramp on the Boston end of the bridge.

Ramp &quot;B&quot;, from southbound (Boston bound) bridge lanes to eastbound Storrow Drive, caused traffic to merge onto Storrow Drive from the left (high speed) lanes using a short acceleration lane, causing safety issues. The MDC requested elimination of this ramp. Compared to overall bridge traffic of 30,000 vehicles per day, traffic on ramp B was found to be low, approximately 1,500 vehicles per day with a peak of 120 vehicles per hour.

The historic value of the bridge was considered significant, so the plan was to make the replacement superstructure appear similar, with similar railing and lighting. In order to document the pre-existing structure, a Historic American Engineering Record (HAER) would be prepared.

Pier 12 was exhibiting inappropriate movement and was scheduled for reinforcement.

The work would be done in two phases. Phase 1 would reinforce the downstream side of the bridge to allow MBTA bus traffic, and was expected to take 5 months. Most of this effort would be spent on the underside of the bridge and would not affect existing traffic. Phase 2 would replace the entire superstructure and was expected to take three construction seasons to implement. Cost was estimated to be (US$ with inflation). Phase 1 finished in 1987, and Phase 2 in 1990.


===Subsequent events===
In the fall of 2014, the Charles River Conservancy announced that an anonymous donor would fund an upgrade of the street lights for both the roadway and both sidewalks on the bridge. The new roadway and aesthetic lighting was installed in 2015, highlighting the smoot marks along the sidewalk. The design was selected after a competition won by Miguel Rosales of Rosales + Partners. The light posts were located apart.
&quot;It will provide safe lighting for pedestrians and drivers, and the elements of design on the bridge will be pulled out and emphasized. It will become a really beautiful bridge,&quot; said Renata von Tscharner, founder and president of the Charles River Conservancy.

===Separated bicycle lanes===

In November 2021, to improve bicycle safety, MassDOT initiated a separated bicycle lane pilot on the Harvard by placing cones to create two wide bicycle lanes. This reduced general purpose lanes from four to two over the bridge. Despite some hiccups involving vandalism, the pilot was deemed a success in the Fall 2022. MassDOT went on to hire Toole Design Group to engineer flex-post separated bicycle lanes, bus priority lanes, and new traffic signal phasing for the corridor. These changes were implemented just before 2023, and have been in place since. To this date, the Harvard Bridge remains one of the most popular cycling routes in New England, with an average of over 1,000 bicyclists in each direction per day.

==Smoots==

The Harvard Bridge is marked off in an idiosyncratic unit of measure, the smoot.

In 1958, members of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity at MIT measured the bridge&#x27;s eastern sidewalk by using that year&#x27;s shortest , Oliver Smootnominally, tallas a measuring stick. Years after this stunt, Smoot became president of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and later president of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

Markers painted at intervals give the bridge&#x27;s length 364.4 smoots long, &quot;plus one ear&quot;. Originally this read &quot;plus or minus one ear&quot;representing measurement uncertaintybut over the years the words &quot;or minus&quot; disappeared. The marks are repainted periodically by members of the fraternityoriginally surreptitiously and later openly.

During the major reconstruction in the 1980s, the new sidewalks were divided into smoot-length slabs rather than the standard six feet, and the smoot markings were painted on the new deck. Officials&#x27; original determination to omit the smoot markings from the reconstructed bridge, and to scrupulously prevent the fraternity from repainting them, evaporated when it was realized that police routinely used the smoot marks as reference points in accident reports.

The nominal length of 364.4 smoots (from two designated points at the bridge&#x27;s ends) corresponds to about 2030 feet or 620 m, somewhat less than the bridge&#x27;s published length of . A possible cause is that in 1958, there were ramps to Storrow Drive on both sides of the bridge, which interrupted the sidewalk earlier than it extends today. A bridge of corresponds to 387.7 smoots ± one ear.

<text>A ramp meter, ramp signal, or metering light is a device, usually a basic traffic light or a two-section signal light (red and green only, no yellow) together with a signal controller, that regulates the flow of traffic entering freeways according to current traffic conditions. Ramp meters are used at freeway on-ramps to manage the rate of automobiles entering the freeway. Ramp metering systems have proved to be successful in decreasing traffic congestion and improving driver safety.

Ramp meters are claimed to reduce congestion (increase speed and volume) on freeways by reducing demand and by breaking up groups of cars. Two variations of demand reduction are commonly cited; one being access rate, the other diversion. Some ramp meters are designed and programmed to operate only at times of peak travel demand; during off-peak times, such meters are either showing a steady green, flashing yellow (Maryland), or are turned off altogether. This allows traffic to merge onto the freeway without stopping. Other ramp meters are designed to operate continuously, only being turned off for maintenance or repairs.

==Types==
Some metered ramps have bypass lanes for high-occupancy vehicles, allowing carpools, buses, and other eligible vehicles to skip the queue and get directly on the highway. In other places such as Northern California, carpool lanes are still metered, but the queue is typically shorter in comparison to regular lanes. Meters often only operate in rush hour periods. Some ramp meters have only one lane of traffic at the signal; others may have two or more lanes of traffic. Generally, meters with multiple lanes only give one lane the green light at a time. In one common configuration, each entrance lane has two signals; a red-yellow-green signal perched overhead over each lane (or mounted high on a pole for a single lane), and a two-phase lamp mounted low on a pole next to the stop line.

The overhead lights are for cars approaching the metering point; the low-mounted two-phase lights are intended to be used by the vehicle at the front of the queue. In normal operation of the ramp meters, only the red and green lamps are used. However, when ramp metering is about to be enabled, the overhead lamps may show flashing or solid yellow to warn drivers to prepare to stop. (Once ramp metering is turned on, there is no further need for the yellow lamp.) In California, some meters allow two or three cars to proceed on a green light. These meters use red-yellow-green signals on both the upper and lower mounts on the pole, and operate in a standard green-yellow-red fashion.

In Ontario, the ramp meter lights are always green when there are no restrictions in place for traffic to proceed.

The sophistication and extent of a ramp metering system is based on the amount of improvement desired, existing traffic conditions, installation costs, and the continuing resource requirements that are necessary to operate and maintain the system effectively. The simplest form of control is a fixed time operation. It performs the basic functions of breaking up platoons into single-vehicle entries and setting an upper limit on the flow rates that enter the freeway. Presence and passage detectors may be installed on the ramp to actuate and terminate the metering cycles, but the metering rate is based on average traffic conditions at a particular ramp at a particular time. This type of operation provides the benefits associated with accident reductions, but is not as effective in regulating freeway volumes because there is no input about mainline traffic. Pre-timed control can be implemented on any number of ramps, and is often implemented as an initial operating strategy until individual ramps can be incorporated into a traffic responsive system. 

The next level of control, traffic responsive, establishes metering rates based on actual freeway conditions. The local traffic responsive approach utilizes detectors and a micro-processor to determine the mainline flow in the immediate vicinity of the ramp and the ramp demand to select an appropriate metering rate. Traffic responsive control also permits ramp metering to be used to help manage demand when incidents occur on the freeway, i.e. reduce the metering rate at ramps upstream of the incident and increase the rate at ramps downstream. 

System-wide control is a form of traffic responsive control but operates on the basis of total freeway conditions. Centralized computer controlled systems can handle numerous ramps in a traffic responsive scheme and feature multiple control programs and overrides. Control strategies can also be distributed among individual ramps. A significant feature of system control is interconnection that permits the metering rate at any ramp to be influenced by conditions at other locations. Denver showed that this type of control has significant benefits when properly applied.

System control need not be limited to the freeway and its ramps. The concept of integrated traffic control combines or coordinates freeway and arterial street control systems to operate on the basis of corridor wide traffic conditions. The potential advantages of integrated control include reduced installation and operating costs, corridor wide surveillance, better motorist information, and quicker and coordinated use of all of the control elements (meters, signals, signs, etc.) in response to real time traffic conditions. Simulation results from one study showed that, during an incident, coordination of arterial traffic signals and ramp meters can improve the traffic performance of a corridor.

==Ramp metering signal controls==
Ramp meter signals are set according to the current traffic conditions on the road. Detectors (generally an induction loop) are installed in the road, both on the ramp and on the main road which measure and calculate the traffic flow, speed and occupancy levels. These are then used to alter the number of vehicles that can leave the ramp. The more congested the main freeway, the fewer vehicles are allowed to leave the ramp, this is effected by giving longer red times to the traffic signals.

Much research is currently being carried out into the most appropriate algorithms for controlling ramp meter signals. Some algorithms that are in use or have been evaluated are ALINEA, demand control and fuzzy algorithms.

===Demand control algorithms===
The demand control algorithms are examples of feed-forward control. One version of the demand control algorithm is the RWS strategy used in the Netherlands. In this algorithm the number of vehicles that the signals allow off the ramp is calculated as the difference between the flow before the ramp and the pre-specified capacity of the road. 

==Ramp metering in North America==
This first application involved a police officer who would stop traffic on an entrance ramp and release vehicles one at a time at a predetermined rate, so that the objectives of safer and smoother merging onto the freeway traffic was easier without disrupting the mainline flows.

Ramp metering was first implemented in 1963 on the Eisenhower Expressway (Interstate 290) in Chicago by Adolf D. May, now a UC Berkeley professor. Development in systems control theory allowed for improved traffic regulation throughout the early 1970s, pioneered by Leif Isaksen in his paper &quot;Suboptimal Control of Large Scale Systems with Application to Freeway Traffic Regulation.&quot; Since then ramp-meters have been systematically deployed in many urban areas including Los Angeles; San Diego; Sacramento; the San Francisco Bay Area; Fresno; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Seattle; Spokane; Denver; Phoenix; Las Vegas; Salt Lake City; Portland, Oregon; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Milwaukee; Columbus; Cincinnati; Houston; Atlanta; Miami; Orlando; Washington, DC (only along Interstate 270 in Montgomery County, Maryland and Interstate 395 and Interstate 66 in Arlington County, Virginia); Kansas City, Missouri; and along the Queen Elizabeth Way in Mississauga, Ontario (Toronto-bound ramps from Cawthra Road, Hurontario Street, Mississauga Road, Erin Mills Parkway, Winston Churchill Boulevard, Ford Drive) Canada since the 1970s. In the early 1970s, this traffic control practice drew the attention of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which was looking for innovative ways to reduce air pollution in California by make the transportation system more effective.
Ramp meters are commonplace in the New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Seattle, Phoenix, Houston, Atlanta, Milwaukee, Columbus, and Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan areas, and they are also found in more than two dozen smaller metropolitan areas. In the New York City metro area, locals refer to ramp meters as &quot;merge lights&quot; and in Houston they&#x27;re known as &quot;flow signals.&quot;

Ramp meters have been withdrawn after initial introduction in several cities, including Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin, Texas. Disused metering signals can still be found along some parkways surrounding New York City and Detroit. Although deactivated shortly after they were added, ramp meters have been reactivated at select interchanges of Interstate 476 in suburban Philadelphia.

Ramp meters were installed along Interstate 435 in Overland Park, Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri in 2009. In 2017, ramp meters were installed along Interstate 35 in Kansas City.

Ramp meters in Mississauga, Ontario are designed in such a way so that if the queue waiting to enter the QEW grows to the point where it may back up onto city streets, the meter is lifted and all traffic entering the highway is able to move freely without waiting for the meter. The meter goes back into service once the ramp queue is reduced to a reasonable level. While this method may increase congestion on the highway itself, it has the benefit of keeping city arterials free of stopped traffic waiting in queue. Ramp queues are usually quite short, lasting only 5–6 seconds on average before the driver may continue to the freeway.

===Minneapolis–Saint Paul ramp meter experiment===
In 2000, a $650,000 experiment was mandated by the Minnesota State Legislature in response to citizen complaints and the efforts of State Senator Dick Day. The study involved shutting off all 433 ramp meters in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area for eight weeks to test their effectiveness. The study was conducted by Cambridge Systematics and concluded that when the ramp meters were turned off freeway capacity decreased by 9%, travel times increased by 22%, freeway speeds dropped by 7% and crashes increased by 26%. However, ramp meters remain controversial, and the Minnesota State Department of Transportation has developed new ramp control strategies. Fewer meters are activated during the course of a normal day than prior to the 2000 study, some meters have been removed, timing has been altered so that no driver waits more than four minutes in ramp queue, and vehicles are not allowed to back up onto city streets.

=== Mainline metering ===
A mainline meter throttles traffic flow from one segment of a highway to the next by directly metering the highway&#x27;s traffic. Such a scheme is typically implemented in specialized situations such as bridges and tunnels. A mainline meter was installed at the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge toll plaza in the early 1970s. Similar mainline meters have also been installed downstream from the toll plazas at two other San Francisco Bay crossings, the San Mateo Bridge and the Dumbarton Bridge. However, these mainline meters have not yet been activated (as of September 2006). A mainline meter also exists on California State Route 125 southbound at its junction with Interstate 8 in La Mesa, California.

== Ramp metering in Europe ==
Ramp metering has been installed in several countries in Europe, including the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands. A research project, &quot;EURAMP - European Ramp Metering Project&quot;, funded by the European Union was completed in March 2007. The EURAMP Project Deliverables included information about the results of ramp metering in a number of locations and situations, and whether they were helpful in those situations, and a &quot;Handbook of ramp metering&quot;.

=== United Kingdom ===

The first trial in the UK was on the M6 J10 near Walsall in 1986. No more sites were developed for the next two decades until a second &#x27;pilot&#x27; study in 2006 by the Highways Agency (HA) concluded that ramp metering provides a net benefit under certain conditions - generally more congested junctions. A Summary Report by the HA, dated November 2007, includes an overview of the background and history, international experience, limitations, system operation, algorithms and implementation of ramp metering. In its conclusion it &quot;envisaged ramp metering will be deployed more widely in the coming period.&quot; Ramp metering was then introduced widely in England - Phase 1 involved the implementation of approximately 30 sites and was completed by 2008. Phase 2 followed and as of March 2011 there are 88 Ramp Metering sites on the 4,500 miles (7,242 km) of strategic highways operated and maintained by the HA.

=== The Netherlands ===
The first ramp metering in the Netherlands was introduced in 1989. Ramp metering is being introduced more widely in the Netherlands after a pilot study by the AVV Transport Research Centre which concluded that ramp metering can provide a small benefit for the traffic flow on the highway, leading to a higher capacity. Ramp meters can also contribute to decreasing &#x27;rat running&#x27;. By 2006 50 ramp meters were installed. This number increases by 4 to 5 each year.

=== Germany ===
Ramp metering has been implemented on Autobahns in several areas in Germany, including the Rhine-Ruhr area, Munich, and Hamburg.

=== Italy ===
Ramp metering has been implemented on Tangenziale di Venezia (A57) as temporary solution for the increased traffic before the definitive solution (building of the Passante di Mestre).

=== Ireland ===
There is one metered ramp in Ireland, located at J1 on the M1 Motorway (Ireland) Northbound. It is on the entry ramp from Coolock Lane, and is used when the M1 gets congested due to the M1 Port Tunnel and the M1 meeting further up.
=== Poland ===
The first two ramp meters in the country were installed in 2022 on two on-ramps on expressway S2 in Warsaw. These are the last on-ramps before the entrance of the Ursynów Tunnel both eastbound and westbound.

== Ramp metering elsewhere ==

=== Japan ===
Ramp metering is being installed in Japan in the next few years to keep the flow of traffic moving in Japan. There are plans to install ramp meters on every on-ramp in the Japan motorway system.

=== Australia ===

The largest ramp metering network in the country is in Melbourne (managed and controlled through VicRoads) on the Eastern Freeway and most of all, on the entire inner-city M1 route which includes the Monash Freeway, the CityLink Tollway, the West Gate Freeway and the metropolitan section (south of the beginning of the Monash Freeway) for the Princes Freeway. There are also various ramp meters on the inner-city section of the Calder Freeway. Brisbane&#x27;s Pacific Motorway and Bruce Highway (S/Bound Caboolture - Gateway Mwy) also uses ramp metering on some on-ramps, as does the northbound on-ramps of Perth&#x27;s Kwinana Freeway between Roe and Canning Highways. On most motorways, ramp metering is activated when sensors indicate that traffic is heavy, however, some motorways without sensors use time-based activation.

The 2010 M1 Upgrade in Melbourne installed 62 ramp meters that are coordinated using the HERO suite of algorithms developed by Markos Papageorgiou and Associates from the Technical University of Crete. The system was built on the STREAMS platform and utilises the state-of-the-art ITS architecture. All the ramps can be linked when required to resolve motorway bottlenecks before they emerge. The results of a trial improved capacity by 9% over the previous fixed-time ramp-metering system, average speeds increased by 20 km/h (12 MPH) and traffic throughput at bottleneck locations can be reliably maintained around 2200 PCE per lane. The HERO system takes real time data every 20 seconds from the motorway, ramps and arterial road in order determine the best signal timing for the next 20 seconds. The data detection system comprises Sensys detectors in every freeway lane at 500 m (1,640 feet ) spacings with a minimum detectors at three locations on each ramp including the freeway entrance with the arterial road. The system also manages the arterial road interface with the freeway, balances ramp queues and delays across ramps, and is capable of managing bottlenecks 3–4 km (1.8 - 2.4 mi) downstream of a ramp entrance. The system is also supplemented by real-time travel-time information to key destinations and incident and congestion information displayed on specially designed full-colour VMS on the approaches to the freeway entrance ramps. This information provides sufficient advice for motorists to determine whether or not to use the freeway during incidents etc. The system also provides dynamic ramp closure in the event of a major incident.

Ramp metering was introduced on the Rozelle Interchange in Sydney in 2024 to alleviate congestion for Victoria Rd users, after lengthy delays and back-ups through Drummoyne and Rozelle and onto the Anzac Bridge. https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/projects/current-projects/rozelle-interchange.

Auckland has currently 91 ramp meters across the Southern, South Western, Northern and North Western motorways making it the largest Southern Hemisphere ramp metering system. Ramp metering was installed Auckland-wide after a successful trial on Mahunga Drive in 2004, before the Mangere Bridge.

Traffic data collected from 25 ramp metering sites in 2007 (before ramp metering deployment) and 2009 (after) shows an average 25% improvement in both congestion duration and traffic speed as well as an 8% increase in traffic throughput. The data also shows an average reduction in crashes of 22%. This performance and safety data translates into estimated benefits of US$1.6M per ramp metering site per year.

The system controlling the ramps promotes the traditional coordination among on-ramps as well as real-time integration with traffic signals on the adjacent arterial network allowing the whole road network to be managed as a single integrated network. For example, when motorway incidents adversely impact the adjacent arterial roads, an automatic response to the arterial traffic signals can be triggered to mitigate the impacts of the incident and vice versa. Recurrent and excessive traffic queues at on-ramp and off-ramp can also be managed in an integrated way in real-time. This integrated management is possible in Auckland because the same adaptive SCATS system controls both arterial traffic lights and motorway ramp meters.

The term &quot;Ramp Signalling&quot; rather than &quot;Ramp Metering&quot; is purposefully adopted in New Zealand as a user-oriented name.

=== South Africa ===
Ramp meters were, for a while, installed on the Samrand South bound, Old Johannesburg South bound and on New Road North and South bound interchanges on the N1 Ben Schoeman highway. The ramp metering was part of the Intelligent Transport System launched in October 2007 to aid traffic flow between Johannesburg and Pretoria.

A ramp meter has also been installed on the northbound on-ramp from Blue Lagoon to the M4 Highway in Durban since early 2007.

=== Taiwan ===
Freeways in Taiwan use ramp meters during peak hours since 1993. Traffic enforcement cameras are deployed to deter running the red lights, but a bus lane at Taipei Interchange from northbound Chongqing North Road to southbound National Highway No. 1 in northern Datong District, Taipei allows buses and properly indicated emergency vehicles to bypass the traffic control imposed by the ramp meters.

=== Turkey ===
In 2016, two ramp meters were installed on a major highway in Istanbul. It has been noted that there is a 10% improvement in traffic provement along with 20% decrease in delays.

== Enforcement ==
On some ramp meters, there is a singular red light on the backside of the signal that is synchronized with the red light on the traffic signal that the drivers see when queueing. When the queueing drivers see the red light on the traffic signal, the backside red light is on, when the traffic signal displays green or yellow, the backside red light is off. This allows highway patrol to enforce the metering lights by having an officer park their car or motorcycle on the shoulder a short distance past the targeted signal, watch the red light for any offenders, and pull them over. Additionally, if the given ramp has a carpool bypass lane, officers from that vantage point may also catch and pull over non-carpoolers who are illegally using the carpool lane to skip past the ramp meter queue.
On westbound I-80 in Oakland, California just past the Bay Bridge toll plaza, there is a section with overhead metering lights that cycle when the freeway traffic volumes are high, equipped with cameras that capture license plate images of drivers who run the red light and then send a fine.

<doc id="102607" wikidata="Q1480013" url="?curid=102607" title="Minneapolis–Saint Paul">
<text>Minneapolis–Saint Paul is a metropolitan area in the Upper Midwestern United States centered around the confluence of the Mississippi, Minnesota, and St. Croix rivers in the U.S. state of Minnesota. It is commonly known as the Twin Cities after the area&#x27;s two largest cities, Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Minnesotans often refer to the two together (or the seven-county metro area collectively) simply as &quot;The Cities&quot;. The area is Minnesota&#x27;s economic, cultural, and political center.

Minneapolis sits mostly on the west side of the Mississippi River on lake-covered terrain. Although most of the city is residential neighborhoods, it has a business-dominated downtown area with some historic industrial areas, the Mill District and the North Loop area. Saint Paul, which sits mostly on the east side of the river, has a smaller business district, many tree-lined neighborhoods, and a large collection of late-Victorian architecture. Both cities, and the surrounding smaller cities, feature lakes, hills, and creeks.

Originally inhabited by the Ojibwe and Dakota people, the two cities were settled by various Europeans. Minneapolis was strongly influenced by early Scandinavian and Lutheran settlers, while Saint Paul was settled predominantly by the French, the Irish, and German Catholics. Both urban areas are home to new immigrant communities, including Mexicans, Somalis, Hmong, Indians, Ethiopians (particularly Oromo), Vietnamese, Cameroonians, and Liberians.

&quot;Twin Cities&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the seven-county region governed by the Metropolitan Council regional governmental agency and planning organization. The United States Office of Management and Budget officially designates 15 counties as the &quot;Minneapolis–St. Paul–Bloomington MN–WI Metropolitan Statistical Area&quot;. It is the 16th-largest metropolitan statistical area in the U.S. and third-largest metropolitan area in the Midwest, with a population of 3,690,261 at the 2020 census. The larger 21-county Minneapolis–St. Paul MN–WI Combined Statistical Area, the nation&#x27;s 16th-largest combined statistical area, had a population of 4,078,788 at the 2020 census.

==History==


=== European settlement ===
The first European settlement in the region was near what is now the town of Stillwater, Minnesota, about from downtown Saint Paul and on the western bank of the St. Croix River, which forms the border of central Minnesota and Wisconsin. Another settlement that fueled early interest in the area was the outpost at Fort Snelling, which was constructed from 1820 to 1825 at the confluence of the Minnesota River and the Mississippi River.

The Fort Snelling military reservation bordered both sides of the river up to Saint Anthony Falls. The town of Saint Anthony grew just outside the reservation on the river&#x27;s east side. For several years, the only European resident to live on the west bank of the river was Colonel John H. Stevens, who operated a ferry service across the river. When the military reservation was reduced in size, settlers quickly moved to the land, creating the new village of Minneapolis. The town grew, with Minneapolis and Saint Anthony eventually merging. On the eastern side of the Mississippi, a few villages such as Pig&#x27;s Eye and Lambert&#x27;s Landing grew to become Saint Paul.

==Geography==
Natural geography played a role in the two cities&#x27; settlement and development. The Mississippi River Valley in the area is defined by a series of stone bluffs that line the river. Saint Paul grew up around Lambert&#x27;s Landing, the last place to unload boats coming upriver at an easily accessible point, seven miles (11 km) downstream from Saint Anthony Falls, the geographic feature that, due to the value of its immense water power for industry, defined Minneapolis&#x27;s location and its prominence as the Mill City. The falls can be seen from the Mill City Museum, housed in the former Washburn &quot;A&quot; Mill, which was among the world&#x27;s largest mills in its time. The phrase &quot;St. Paul is the last city of the East, Minneapolis the first city of the West&quot; alludes to the historical difference.

=== Farming ===

The state&#x27;s oldest farms are in Washington County. The county borders the St. Croix River and Wisconsin on the eastern side of the metropolitan area. Joseph Haskell was Minnesota&#x27;s first white farmer, harvesting the first crops in the state in 1840 on what is now part of Afton Township on Trading Post Trail.

=== Grand Excursion ===

The Grand Excursion, a trip into the Upper Midwest sponsored by the Rock Island Railroad, brought more than a thousand curious travelers into the area by rail and steamboat in 1854. In 1855, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow published &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, an epic poem based on the Ojibwe legends of Hiawatha. A number of natural area landmarks appear in the story, including Lake Minnetonka and Minnehaha Falls. Tourists inspired by the coverage of the Grand Excursion in eastern newspapers and those who read &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; flocked to the area in the following decades.

=== Rail transport ===
At one time, the region had numerous passenger rail services, including both interurban streetcar systems and interstate rail. Due to the river&#x27;s width at points farther south, the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area was briefly one of the few places where the Mississippi could be crossed by railroad. Much commercial rail traffic also ran through the area, often carrying grain to be processed at Minneapolis mills or delivering other goods to Saint Paul to be transported along the Mississippi. Saint Paul was long at the head of navigation on the river, until a lock and dam facility was added upriver in Minneapolis.

Passenger travel hit its peak in 1888, with nearly eight million traversing to and from Saint Paul Union Depot. This amounted to approximately 150 trains daily. Soon, other rail crossings were built farther south and travel through the region began to decline. In an effort by the rail companies to combat the rise of the automobile, some of the earliest streamliners ran from Chicago to Minneapolis/Saint Paul and eventually served distant points in the Pacific Northwest. Today, this interstate service is served by Amtrak&#x27;s Seattle/Portland-to-Chicago &quot;Empire Builder&quot; route, running once daily in each direction, and supplemented by the route to Chicago. The Empire Builder is named after James J. Hill, a railroad tycoon who settled on Summit Avenue in Saint Paul in what is now known as the James J. Hill House.

=== Socioeconomic history ===
Like many Northern cities that grew up with the Industrial Revolution, Minneapolis and St. Paul experienced shifts in their economic base as heavy industry declined, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. With the economic decline of those decades came population decline in the central city areas, white flight to suburbs, and, in the summer of 1967, race riots on Minneapolis&#x27;s North Side. But by the 1980s and 1990s, Minneapolis and Saint Paul were often cited as former Rust Belt cities that had made successful transitions to service, high-technology, finance, and information economies.

In May and June 2020, the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area became a focus of international attention after MPD officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for almost ten minutes. The murder sparked local, nationwide and international protests against racism and police brutality, bringing considerable attention to the MPD. Minneapolis–Saint Paul was the site of the second-costliest act of civil disobedience in U.S. history, after the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. Local protests and riots caused an estimated $550 million in damages and affected around 1,600 businesses.

===Rivalry===
Minneapolis and Saint Paul have competed since they were founded, resulting in some duplication of effort. After Saint Paul completed its elaborate cathedral in 1915, Minneapolis followed up with the equally ornate Basilica of St. Mary in 1926. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the rivalry became so intense that an architect practicing in one city was often refused business in the other. The 1890 United States census even led to the two cities arresting and/or kidnapping each other&#x27;s census takers, in an attempt to keep each city from outgrowing the other.

The rivalry occasionally erupted into inter-city violence, as at a 1929 game between the Minneapolis Millers and the St. Paul Saints, both baseball teams of the American Association. In the 1950s, both cities competed for a major league baseball franchise (which resulted in two rival stadiums being built), and there was a brief period in the mid-1960s when the two cities could not agree on a common calendar for daylight saving time, resulting in a few weeks when people in Minneapolis were one hour &quot;behind&quot; those in Saint Paul.

The cities&#x27; mutual antagonism was largely healed by the end of the 1960s, aided by the simultaneous arrival in 1961 of the Minnesota Twins of the American League and the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League, both of which identified themselves with the state as a whole (the former explicitly named for both Twin Cities) rather than either city (like the earlier Minneapolis Lakers). Since 1961, it has been common practice for any major sports team based in the Twin Cities to be named for Minnesota as a whole. In terms of development, the two cities remain distinct in their progress, with Minneapolis absorbing new and avant-garde architecture while Saint Paul continues to carefully integrate new buildings into the context of classical and Victorian styles.

==Geology==
Like much of Minnesota, the Twin Cities area was shaped by water and ice over millions of years. The area&#x27;s land sits atop thick layers of sandstone and limestone laid down as seas encroached upon and receded from the region. Erosion caused natural caves to develop, which were expanded into mines when white settlers came to the area. During Prohibition, at least one speakeasy was built into these hidden spaces—eventually refurbished as Saint Paul&#x27;s Wabasha Street Caves.

Lakes across the area were formed and altered by the movement of glaciers. This left many bodies of water in the region, some with unusual shapes. For example, Lake Minnetonka, toward the western side of the Twin Cities, consists of a complex arrangement of channels and large bays. Elevations in the area range from above sea level in the northwest metro to at the edge of the Mississippi River in the southeast.

===Climate===

Owing to their northerly latitude and inland location, the Twin Cities experience the coldest climate of any major metropolitan area in the United States. But due to their southern location in the state and the urban heat island, the Twin Cities are among Minnesota&#x27;s warmest places. The average annual temperature recorded at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport is ; colder than Winona, Minnesota, and warmer than Roseau, Minnesota. Monthly average daily high temperatures range from in January to in July; the average daily minimum temperatures for those months are and respectively.
Minimum temperatures of or lower are seen on an average of 29.7 days per year, and 76.2 days do not have a maximum temperature exceeding the freezing point. Temperatures above occur an average of 15 times per year. Higher temperatures at or above are recorded once every 4–5 years on average, and sometimes during a single summer. The lowest temperature ever reported at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport was on January 22, 1936; the highest, , was reported on July 14 of the same year. Early settlement records at Fort Snelling show temperatures as low as . Recent records include at Vadnais Lake on February 2, 1996 (National Climatic Data Center).

Precipitation averages per year, and is most plentiful in June () and least so in February (). The greatest one-day rainfall amount was , reported on July 23, 1987. The cities&#x27; record for lowest annual precipitation was set in 1910, when fell throughout the year; coincidentally, the opposite record of was set the next year. At an annual average of , snowfall is generally abundant.

The Twin Cities area takes the brunt of many types of extreme weather, including high-speed straight-line winds, tornadoes, flash floods, drought, heat, bitter cold, and blizzards. The costliest weather disaster in Twin Cities history was a derecho event on May 15, 1998. Hail and wind damage exceeded $950 million, much of it in the Twin Cities. Other memorable Twin Cities weather-related events include the tornado outbreak on May 6, 1965, the Armistice Day Blizzard on November 11, 1940, and the Halloween Blizzard of 1991. In January 2019, Minnesota experienced its coldest temperatures since 1996, when a polar vortex dropped temperatures as low as in Cotton, Minnesota, with wind-chill temperatures lower than in much of the state. These temperatures are colder than those found on the surface of Mars. (See: Department of Natural Resources - Cold Outbreak: January 27-31, 2019)

A normal growing season in the metro extends from late April or early May through the month of October. The USDA places the area in the 4a plant hardiness zone.

==Communities==

===Metropolitan Statistical Area===

The Minneapolis–St. Paul–Bloomington MN–WI Metropolitan Statistical Area, or Twin Cities, includes 15 counties, of which 13 are in Minnesota and two in Wisconsin. The Minnesota portion accounts for almost two-thirds of Minnesota&#x27;s population.

Note: Counties that are bolded are under jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Council. Counties that are &quot;italicized&quot; were added to the metropolitan area when the Office of Management and Budget revised its delineations of metropolitan statistical areas in 2013. Sibley County was included in the metropolitan statistical area from 2013 to September 2018.

===Combined Statistical Area===

The Minneapolis–St. Paul, MN–WI Combined Statistical Area is made up of 19 counties in Minnesota and two counties in Wisconsin. The statistical area includes two metropolitan areas and four micropolitan areas. As of the 2010 census, the CSA had a population of 3,682,928 (though a July 1, 2012 estimate placed it at 3,691,918). In 2013, the Owatonna Micropolitan Statistical Area was added.

Note: Owatonna MSA was not part of CSA in 2010.

===Cities and suburbs===
There are approximately 218 incorporated municipalities in the Twin Cities metropolitan region. This includes census-designated places and villages in Wisconsin, but excludes unincorporated towns in Wisconsin, known as civil townships in other states. Population numbers are from the 2020 census.

==Culture==
===Fine and performing arts===
The Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area fine art museums include the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Walker Art Center, the Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum, Minnesota Museum of American Art and The Museum of Russian Art. Other museums include American Swedish Institute, Science Museum of Minnesota, Minnesota Children&#x27;s Museum, Bell Museum (natural history and planetarium) and The Bakken Museum (science and technology). The Minnesota Orchestra and the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra are full-time professional musical ensembles. The Guthrie Theater is a world-class regional theater overlooking the Mississippi River. The Minnesota Fringe Festival is an annual celebration of theatre, dance, improvisation, puppetry, kids&#x27; shows, visual art, and musicals.

The Twin Cities is also the home of Minnesota Public Radio (MPR), the nation&#x27;s second-largest public radio station. It has both a classical station and a contemporary station, The Current, which plays music from regional and other contemporary artists. The MPR program &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;, hosted by Minnesota native Garrison Keillor, aired live for many years from the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul. The show ended its run in 2016, with its successor &quot;Live from Here&quot; also airing from the same venue. This radio program was the basis of the 2006 film &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;.

The Brave New Workshop Comedy Theater is a sketch and improvisational comedy theater in Minneapolis. It is the nation&#x27;s oldest comedy theater.

The Current and the Walker Art Center host the annual music festival Rock the Garden, which features nationally recognized and local artists. The festival has been held annually since 2008 and has featured artists such as Lizzo, Hippo Campus, Chance the Rapper, Bon Iver, The Flaming Lips, Wilco and Sonic Youth.

The Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis hosts the annual Basilica Block Party, another music festival, which has featured nationally recognized artists such as Weezer, Andy Grammer, Death Cab for Cutie and Panic! at the Disco. The festival is used as a fundraiser for the restoration of the basilica. The event draws about 25,000 people to the downtown area.

The Twin Cities area has a number of venues where artists come to perform. Minneapolis is home to First Avenue. First Avenue is known for being the starting venue for many famous artists and bands from the area, including Prince, The Replacements, Atmosphere, and Manny Phesto. It became one of the most recognizable venues in Minnesota after the release of the Prince movie Purple Rain, in which it is featured.

===Outdoors===
There are numerous lakes in the region, and some cities in the area have extensive park systems for recreation. Organized recreation includes the Great River Energy bicycle festival, the Twin Cities Marathon, and the U.S. pond hockey championships. Some studies have shown that area residents take advantage of this, and are among the most physically fit in the country, but others have disputed that. Medicine is a major industry in the region and the southeasterly city of Rochester, as the University of Minnesota has joined other colleges and hospitals in doing significant research, and major medical device manufacturers started in the region (the most prominent is Medtronic). Technical innovators have brought important advances in computing, including the Cray line of supercomputers.

Many Twin Cities residents own or share cabins and other properties along lakes and forested areas in central and northern Minnesota, and weekend trips &quot;up North&quot; happen in the warmer months. Ice fishing is a major winter pastime, although overambitious fishers sometimes find themselves in danger when they venture onto the ice too early or too late. Hunting, snowmobiling, ATV riding and other outdoor activities are also popular. This connection to the outdoors also brings a strong sense of environmentalism to many Minnesotans.

In 2011 and 2012, the American College of Sports Medicine named Minneapolis–Saint Paul the nation&#x27;s healthiest metropolitan area.

===Sports===


The Twin Cities is one of 12 American metropolitan areas with teams in all four major professional sports—baseball (MLB), football (NFL), basketball (NBA) and ice hockey (NHL). Including Major League Soccer (MLS), it is one of 11 metro areas with five major professional sports teams. To avoid favoring either city, most teams based in the area use only the word &quot;Minnesota&quot; in their names, rather than &quot;Minneapolis&quot; or &quot;St. Paul&quot;.

Minneapolis was the site of two Super Bowls—Super Bowl XXVI in 1992 and Super Bowl LII in 2018. It is the farthest north that a Super Bowl has ever been played. The Minnesota Vikings have played in four Super Bowls—IV in 1970, VIII in 1974, IX in 1975 and XI in 1977.

The World Series has been played in the Twin Cities three times—1965, 1987 and 1991—as have three Major League Baseball All-Star Games—1965, 1985 and 2014. NHL All-Star games were hosted in 1972 and 2004, NBA All-Star game in 1994, WNBA All-Star game in 2018 and MLS All-Star game in 2022.

The Stanley Cup Finals have been played in the Twin Cities twice, in 1981 and 1991. The NHL Stadium Series had a game in the Twin Cities in 2016, and the NHL Winter Classic was played at Target Field in 2022.

The Final Four Men&#x27;s National College Athletics Association (NCAA) basketball tournament has been hosted by Minneapolis four times—1951, 1992, 2001 and 2019—and the Women&#x27;s twice, in 1995 and 2022.

The Frozen Four Men&#x27;s NCAA hockey tournament has been hosted by the Twin Cities nine times—1958, 1966, 1989, 1991, 1994, 2002, 2011, 2018 and 2024.

Major golf tournaments hosted in the Twin Cities include: U.S. Open—1916, 1930, 1970, 1991; U.S. Women&#x27;s Open—1966, 1977, 2008; PGA Championship—1932, 1954, 2002, 2009; Women&#x27;s PGA Championship, 2019; Walker Cup, 1957; Solheim Cup, 2002; and the Ryder Cup, 2016. The Ryder Cup is scheduled to return in 2028.

The 1998 World Figure Skating Championships were held at the Target Center in Minneapolis.

The 2017, 2018 and 2019 X Games were held in Minneapolis. The 2020 X Games were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Twin Cities host three nationally competing Roller Derby leagues: the Minnesota Roller Derby of the Women&#x27;s Flat Track Derby Association Division 1, the North Star Roller Derby of WFTDA Division 2, and Minnesota Men&#x27;s Roller Derby, a league of the Men&#x27;s Roller Derby Association. MNRD and NSRD have four home teams each: the Dagger Dolls, Garda Belts, Rockits, and Atomic Bombshells of MNRD and the Banger Sisters, Delta Delta Di, Kilmores, and Violent Femmes of NSRD, as well as two traveling teams each. MMRD has three home teams: The Gentlemen&#x27;s Club, Destruction Workers, and Thunderjacks, and two traveling teams.

The annual Twin Cities Marathon is held in the fall with a course running through Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Minneapolis was the birthplace of Rollerblade and is a center for inline skating, as well as home to the most golfers per capita of any U.S. city. Additionally, water skiing got its start on Lake Pepin, a lake southeast of the metropolitan area, in the Mississippi River about downstream from Saint Paul.

Some other sports teams gained their names from being in Minnesota before relocating. The Los Angeles Lakers get their name from once being based in Minneapolis, the City of Lakes. The Dallas Stars also derived their name from their tenure as a Minnesota team, the Minnesota North Stars.

====Professional sports teams in Minneapolis–Saint Paul====
The Twin Cities are also home of the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers who play in the Big Ten Conference.

===Media===
====Print====
The Twin Cities have two major daily newspapers: &quot;The Minnesota Star Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Saint Paul Pioneer Press&quot;. The &quot;Minnesota Daily&quot; serves the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Twin Cities campus and surrounding neighborhoods. There is one general-interest neighborhood weekly newspaper still in the cities: The &quot;East Side Review&quot;, devoted to the 90,000 residents in St. Paul&#x27;s eastern third. Other weekly papers are devoted to specific audiences/demographics, including (until 2020) &quot;City Pages&quot;.

====Television====

The region is the 15th-largest television market, according to Nielsen Media Research. Three duopolies exist in the Twin Cities: Twin Cities PBS operates KTCA and KTCI (channels 2.1 and 2.4), Saint Paul-based Hubbard Broadcasting (founded by Stanley E. Hubbard) owns ABC affiliate KSTP-TV (channel 5) and independent station KSTC-TV (channel 5.2), and Fox Television Stations operates Fox owned-and-operated station KMSP-TV (channel 9) and MyNetworkTV O&amp;O WFTC (channel 9.2). Diversified from radio, KSTP-TV was the first television station to operate in the region and the 17th to sign on in the U.S., initially reaching 3,000 sets when Hubbard signed on the station in April 1948.
Two local television stations in the area operate their main studios in Minneapolis: CBS O&amp;O WCCO-TV (channel 4) and CW affiliate WUCW (channel 23, owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group). Saint Paul is home to KSTP/KSTC and KTCA/KTCI. The other major television stations are based in nearby suburban areas: NBC affiliate KARE (channel 11, owned by Tegna) operates a broadcasting complex in Golden Valley, while KMSP/WFTC operates from a facility in Eden Prairie.

For much of the last two decades, WCCO and KARE have had the most popular evening newscasts in the area, while KSTP has struggled to maintain decent ratings on its news programs. Since becoming an independent station in 1979, after losing the ABC affiliation to KSTP in a three-station affiliation swap that resulted in NBC moving from KSTP to then-independent WTCN (now KARE), KMSP has carried a nightly prime time newscast (originally airing at 9:30 p.m. before moving to 9:00 p.m. upon trading time slots with the now-canceled &quot;Independent Network News&quot; in 1982). It remained the top-rated newscast in the 9:00 hour long after it gained competition from then-Fox affiliate WFTC (which launched a standalone news department in April 2001, later absorbed into KMSP&#x27;s existing news operation after Fox acquired both stations that year from Clear Channel Television and United Television, respectively) and independent KSTC (which began airing a newscast produced by sister station KSTP in 2001).

Communities in the region have their own public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable television channels. One, the Metro Cable Network, is available on channel 6 on cable systems across the seven-county region.

Several television programs that originated in the Twin Cities have aired nationally on broadcast and cable networks. KTCA created the science program &quot;Newton&#x27;s Apple&quot; and distributes a children&#x27;s program today. A few unusual comedic shows also originated in the area. In the 1980s, KTMA (later KLGT and KMWB, now WUCW) created a number of low-budget shows, including &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, a satirical B-movie showcase that achieved cult classic status during its 1989–96 national cable run on Comedy Central. The short-lived &quot;Let&#x27;s Bowl&quot; started on KARE and later ran on KLGT and St. Cloud-licensed KXLI-TV (channel 41, now Ion O&amp;O KPXM-TV), before airing on Comedy Central from 2001 to 2002; it was a panel discussion featuring critical and humorous analysis of TV commercials. The advertising-focused panel discussion series &quot;Mental Engineering&quot; originated on the Saint Paul Neighborhood Network (SPNN) cable access channel in 1997 before being syndicated nationally to PBS member stations from 2001 to 2008.

From 1984 to 2002, Hubbard Broadcasting and Viacom operated CONUS Communications, a satellite news gathering and news video-sharing service for local television stations throughout the nation. In 1989, the venture launched All News Channel (ANC), a syndicated television news service that operated from the company&#x27;s St. Paul broadcast facility and used some on-air staff previously employed by KSTP. Similar in format to then-competitor CNN Headline News (now HLN), ANC produced rolling half-hour national newscasts that were syndicated to local stations (most of which, as KSTP did throughout its existence, aired them as overnight filler programming); Hubbard shut down most of CONUS&#x27;s operations and ANC in 2002, citing the dominance of network-run affiliate wire services (such as CNN Newsource), but it maintains a digital archive of its news library.

In 1994, Hubbard launched United States Satellite Broadcasting (USSB), a satellite television provider offering premium channels from Home Box Office, Inc. and Showtime Networks, pay-per-view movies and events, a limited selection of basic cable channels (mainly those in which Viacom held full or partial ownership interest, such as MTV, Lifetime and Nickelodeon), and All News Channel. Founded in 1981 by then-Hubbard President Stanley S. Hubbard, USSB and competitor DirecTV used the Digital Satellite System (DSS) infrastructure, allowing customers to optionally subscribe to both services. Hubbard sold USSB&#x27;s assets to then-DirecTV parent Hughes Electronics in 1999, leading the latter provider to add USSB&#x27;s remaining channels. (Viacom moved its basic channels over to DirecTV the previous year.)

====Radio====
The Twin Cities radio market was ranked 15th by Nielsen in 2018. In November 2018, the area&#x27;s top five morning radio shows were all FM stations: KSTP (94.5), KFXN (100.3), KQQL (107.9), KDWB (101.3), and KXXR (93.7). Three of those stations are owned by iHeartRadio. Most stations broadcast on air and online, as livestreams from their websites.
In addition to owning KSTP television, Hubbard Broadcasting also operates two radio stations that share call letters (which reference their shared licensed city, St. Paul) with its co-owned television outlet: KSTP (1500 AM) maintains a sports radio format as an ESPN Radio affiliate, and KSTP-FM maintains a pop music format. In 1985, Hubbard—valued at $400 million—was one of the nation&#x27;s larger corporate media companies; in 2005, valued at $1.2 billion, Hubbard was a fairly small major-market media operation.

The Twin Cities have a mix of commercial and non-commercial radio stations. The market is dominated by iHeartMedia, which operates seven stations (including contemporary hits outlet KDWB, sports radio outlet KFXN, classic hits outlet KQQL, and news/talk station KTLK). Multiple small, independent stations are award winners, including KUOM]] (770 AM; relayed in St. Paul on 100.7 FM and in Minneapolis on 104.5 FM), operated by the University of Minnesota, community radio outlet KFAI (90.3) in Cedar–Riverside, and African American-oriented community station KMOJ (89.9 FM) in North Minneapolis.

Minnesota Public Radio (MPR)—a regional public radio network that transmits on 46 affiliate stations across the state—broadcasts on three stations in the area, each with distinct programming formats: KNOW (91.1 FM) serves as the flagship station of MPR&#x27;s news and information service, MPR News, featuring locally produced and NPR-distributed news and talk programs; KSJN (99.5 FM) serves as the flagship of MPR&#x27;s classical music service, &quot;YourClassical MPR&quot;; and Northfield-licensed KCMP (89.3 FM) maintains an adult album alternative format branded as &quot;The Current&quot;. (In addition to being relayed on MPR stations in Duluth and Rochester, KCMP&#x27;s &quot;Current&quot; programming is also carried in the Los Angeles market on an HD subchannel of educational FM station KPCC.) MPR was first nationally known for the variety show &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;, which ceased production in 2016. Doing business as American Public Media, the company is the second-largest producer of NPR content, after National Public Radio (of which MPR is an affiliate).

====Independent media====
The Twin Cities is home to many independent media organizations, including The UpTake and &quot;MinnPost&quot;.

==Demographics==
===Population===


===Place of birth===
About 93% of the metropolitan area&#x27;s population is native to the United States, including 0.6% born in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, or abroad to American parents. The rest of the population is foreign-born.

The highest percentages of immigrants came from Asia (38.2%), Latin America (25.4%), and Africa (20.1%); smaller percentages of newcomers came from Europe (13.1%), other parts of North America (3.0%), and Oceania (0.2%).

===Religion===

Minneapolis–Saint Paul is a major center for religion in the state, especially Christianity. The state headquarters of five major Christian churches are there: the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, the Episcopal Diocese of Minnesota, the Presbyterian Synod of Lakes and Prairies, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The Presbyterian and LDS churches both have missions in Saint Paul, Minneapolis, and Bloomington, as does the Orthodox Church in America.

The headquarters of the former American Lutheran Church (ALC), Evangelical Lutheran Church, Lutheran Free Church and the Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church were in Minneapolis; the headquarters of Augsburg Fortress publishing house still is. The Minneapolis Area Synod and the Saint Paul Area Synod are the largest and third-largest synods of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), respectively.

The Evangelical Free Church of America is headquartered in Bloomington, and the Association of Free Lutheran Congregations is headquartered in Plymouth, along with its seminary and a Bible School.

The Twin Cities are home to a Jewish population of approximately 64,800, with about 31% of Jewish households in Minneapolis suburbs, 24% in Minneapolis, 16% in St. Paul, 14% in the St. Paul suburbs, and 15% in outer suburbs. There is also a Hindu temple in the Twin Cities suburb of Maple Grove. The Twin Cities&#x27; sole Sikh gurdwara is in Bloomington. A recent influx of immigrants from Laos and North Africa has brought many more religions to the area. There are several Islamic masjids in the area. There is a temple for the religion of Eckankar in the suburb of Chanhassen known as the Temple of Eck. In addition, many Hmong and Tibetan Buddhist peoples live in Saint Paul; a Hmong Buddhist temple opened in suburban Roseville in 1995. The LDS St. Paul Minnesota Temple opened in Oakdale, a suburb east of Saint Paul, in 2000. There are several Unitarian Universalist communities, such as the First Unitarian Society of Minneapolis, as well as several Pagan and Buddhist groups. Minneapolis–Saint Paul has been called Paganistan due to the large numbers of Pagans living there. An estimated 20,000 Pagans live in the area.

Minneapolis is where the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association started and was its home for more than 50 years.

==Politics==
Minneapolis and Saint Paul have each hosted a national political convention. The 2008 Republican National Convention was held at the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul. Minneapolis hosted the 1892 Republican National Convention at the Industrial Exposition Building.
Like most major metropolitan areas, the Twin Cities is a stronghold for the Democratic Party, known in Minnesota as the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. At the state level, DFLers in the Minnesota legislature have increasingly relied on the Twin Cities to build majorities. Outside of the staunchly liberal urban core, the suburbs of the Twin Cities have been historically competitive for both the DFL and the Republicans.

==Economy==
The Minneapolis–Saint Paul area is home to 24 Fortune 1000 headquarters. The 2022 rankings are:
Private companies headquartered in the Twin Cities area include Cargill, the country&#x27;s largest private company, Carlson, Radisson Hotel Group, Holiday Stationstores, and Andersen. Foreign companies with U.S. headquarters in the Twin Cities include Aimia, Allianz Life, Canadian Pacific, Coloplast, Medtronic, Pearson VUE and Pentair.

The Twin Cities&#x27; economy is the nation&#x27;s 13th-largest and ranks second in the Midwest after Chicago. The Minneapolis–Saint Paul area is also North America&#x27;s second-largest medical device manufacturing center and the fourth-largest U.S. banking center, based on total assets of banks headquartered in the area, after New York, San Francisco, and Charlotte.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis covers the 9th District of the Federal Reserve System, which is made up of Minnesota, Montana, North and South Dakota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Its geographical territory is the third-largest of the 12 Federal Reserve banks.

===Buildings and structures===

The 11 tallest buildings and 16 of the 17 tallest buildings in the area are in downtown Minneapolis. There is some dispute over which building is the tallest—most Minnesotans think of the IDS Center if asked, but most sources seem to agree that Capella Tower is slightly taller. In early 2005, it was found that the IDS Center is taller by a washroom garage on top, bringing its height to . Capella Tower and the Wells Fargo Center differ in height by a foot or two. The tallest building in St. Paul is Wells Fargo Place, at .

Buildings have gone up and been torn down rapidly across the region. Some city blocks have been demolished six or seven times since the mid-19th century. No single architectural style dominates the region. The cities have a mishmash of different designs, although structures from a few eras stand out. There were once many stone buildings in the Richardsonian Romanesque style (or at least Romanesque-inspired variants). Minneapolis City Hall is one prominent example of this, though buildings of all types—including personal residences such as the James J. Hill House—were similarly designed. A few decades later, Art Deco brought several structures that survive today, including St. Paul City Hall, the Foshay Tower, and the Minneapolis Post Office. The style of buildings in the two cities varies greatly. In Minneapolis, the trend has been toward sleek lines and modern glass facades, while Saint Paul tends to follow a more traditional style to better accompany its older structures.
Saint Paul and especially Minneapolis underwent massive urban renewal projects in the post-World War II era, so a vast number of buildings are now lost to history. Some of the larger and harder to demolish structures have survived. In fact, the area might be signified more by bridges than buildings. A series of reinforced concrete arch spans crossing the Mississippi River were built in the 1920s and 1930s. They still carry daily traffic. A number have undergone major repair work, but retain the original design. Several are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the 10th Avenue Bridge, Intercity Bridge (Ford Parkway), Robert Street Bridge, and the longest, the Mendota Bridge. The area is also noted for having the first known permanent crossing of the Mississippi. That structure is long gone, but a series of Hennepin Avenue Bridges have since been built at the site. Both downtowns have extensive networks of enclosed pedestrian bridges known as skyways.

Several prominent Minneapolis buildings helped modernize the city. These include the Walker Art Center, Central Public Library, Weisman Art Museum and the Guthrie Theater. Opening in April 2005, the new Walker Art Center, nearly double its former size, includes increased indoor and outdoor facilities. The Walker is recognized internationally as a singular model of a multidisciplinary arts organization and a national leader for its innovative approaches to audience engagement. The Guthrie received a large amount of media coverage for its opening in June 2006. It was designed by Jean Nouvel and is a facility that houses three theaters: the theater&#x27;s signature thrust stage, seating 1,100; a 700-seat proscenium stage; and a black-box studio with flexible seating. In 2002, the National Trust for Historic Preservation put the old Guthrie building on its list of the most endangered historic properties in the U.S. in response to plans the Walker announced to expand on the land occupied by the theater. The original Guthrie building was torn down in 2006.

===Transportation===
====Roads and highways====
In the 20th century, the Twin Cities area expanded outward significantly. Automobiles made it possible for suburbs to grow greatly. The area now has a number of freeways, and many traffic cameras and ramp meters to monitor and manage traffic congestion. There is some use of HOV (high-occupancy vehicle) express lanes, which is becoming more common. To use an express lane, a driver must have a MnPASS transponder or at least one passenger. MnPASS rates are determined by the amount of traffic on the road and/or the time of day. During non-peak times, the MnPASS express lanes, except those on Interstate 394 (I-394) between Minnesota Highway 100 (MN 100) and I-94, are open to all traffic.

I-94 comes into the area from the east and heads northwest from Minneapolis. Two spur routes form the I-494/I-694 loop, and I-394 continues west when I-94 turns north. I-35 splits in Burnsville in the southern part of the region, bringing I-35E into Saint Paul and I-35W into Minneapolis. They rejoin to the north in Columbus (just south of Forest Lake) and continue to the highway&#x27;s terminus in Duluth. This is one of only two examples of an interstate highway splitting into branches and then rejoining; the other is in Dallas–Fort Worth, where I-35 also splits into east and west branches.

On August 1, 2007, much of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge near downtown Minneapolis collapsed into the Mississippi River around 6:05pm CDT. A replacement bridge opened on September 18, 2008.

====Air travel====
The main airport in the region is Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport (MSP), a major hub for Delta Air Lines. Endeavor Air, a Delta subsidiary is based here. The airport is also the main hub and operating base for Sun Country Airlines. There are six smaller (relief) airports in the area owned and operated by the Metropolitan Airports Commission (the same agency operates MSP). Some people commute by air to the Twin Cities from northern Minnesota.

Relief airports in the metropolitan area are:
* Airlake Airport (LVN) – Lakeville
* Anoka County-Blaine Airport (ANE) – Blaine
* Crystal Airport (MIC) – Crystal
* Flying Cloud Airport (FCM) – Eden Prairie
* Lake Elmo Airport (21D) – Lake Elmo
* St. Paul Downtown Airport (STP) – St. Paul
====Public transit====

Metro Transit, by far the area&#x27;s biggest bus service provider, owes its existence to the old streetcar lines in the area. Metro Transit provides about 95% of the public transit rides in the region, with over 900 buses, while some suburbs have other bus services. The University of Minnesota, Twin Cities operates a free bus system between its campuses. This system includes the Campus Connector bus rapid transit line, which travels between the Minneapolis and Saint Paul campuses by a dedicated bus line and throughout the two campuses on normal access roads. The METRO Blue Line LRT (light rail) began operations in June 2004, connecting downtown Minneapolis, Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport and the Mall of America in Bloomington. It was followed by the METRO Red Line BRT (bus rapid transitway) in 2013 connecting the Mall of America with Lakeville along Cedar Avenue through the southern suburbs. The METRO Green Line LRT connecting downtown Minneapolis, the University of Minnesota campus and downtown Saint Paul along University Avenue opened in 2014. Metro Transit operates all three lines. The Northstar Line commuter rail line connecting Minneapolis with Big Lake opened in 2009.

The METRO system consists of six separate projects. There are two light rail lines: the Blue Line, which runs from Target Field in downtown Minneapolis past Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport to the Mall of America; and the Green Line, which runs from Target Field past the University of Minnesota to Union Depot in downtown Saint Paul. The BRT Red Line serves as an extension of the Blue Line across the Minnesota River, where it connects with southern suburbs at four different stations. The BRT Orange Line connects downtown Minneapolis with Burnsville along I-35W. The arterial BRT A and C lines serve as upgrades to existing local bus routes and connect with the Blue and Green lines at certain shared stations.

 METRO

* Blue Line LRT: Target Field Station – Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport – Mall of America
* Green Line LRT: Target Field Station – University of Minnesota – Union Depot
* Orange Line BRT: Downtown Minneapolis – Burnsville Heart of the City
* Red Line BRT: Mall of America – Apple Valley Transit Station
* A Line BRT: 46th Street station – Rosedale Transit Center
* C Line BRT: Downtown Minneapolis – Brooklyn Center Transit Center
* D Line BRT: Mall of America – Brooklyn Center Transit Center

A variety of rail services are being pondered by state and local governments, including neighborhood streetcar systems, intercity light rail service, and commuter rail options to exurban regions. Minnesota is one of several Midwestern states considering high-speed rail service, using Chicago as a regional hub.

The Minneapolis–Saint Paul area has been criticized for inadequate public transportation. Its public transportation system is less robust than those of many other cities its size. As the metro area has grown, the roads and highways have been updated and widened, but traffic volume is growing faster than the projects needed to widen them, and public transportation has not expanded commensurate with the population. Minneapolis–Saint Paul is ranked the fifth-worst for congestion growth of similar-sized U.S. metro areas. Additional lines and spurs are needed to upgrade public transportation in the Twin Cities. Construction is underway for Green Line extension connecting downtown Minneapolis to the southwest suburb of Eden Prairie. A northwest LRT (Blue Line extension) along Bottineau Boulevard is being planned from downtown Minneapolis to Brooklyn Park. The METRO Orange Line BRT will eventually be extended to Lakeville. The METRO Gold Line BRT is planned to connect downtown Saint Paul to the eastern suburbs within the next few years.

<doc id="102618" wikidata="Q4762213" url="?curid=102618" title="Angel Manfredy">
<text>Angel Manfredy (born October 30, 1974) is a Puerto Rican-American former professional boxer. Angel Manfredy was a popular fighter in the late 1990s.

== Personal ==
Manfredy, nicknamed &quot;El Diablo&quot; (&quot;The Devil&quot;) because of his reckless lifestyle and of his boxing style converted to Christianity after trying to commit suicide in his bed while on cocaine.

He wears a tattoo of the Puerto Rican Flag on his shoulder. Also he has a tattoo of the cross and a naked lady.

== Amateur career ==

Manfredy had an amateur record of 48–8.

== Professional career ==

Manfredy was known for his walk-ins to his matches wearing a latex mask depicting Satan, which he used until his fight with Floyd Mayweather and conversion to Apostolic Pentecostalism.

During his career, Manfredy defeated notable fighters, such as Arturo Gatti (by technical knockout), Ivan Robinson (by knockout), Jorge Páez, and Julio Díaz (by a split decision). He also fought notables Floyd Mayweather Jr., Paul Spadafora and Diego Corrales. A frequent contender, Manfredy was a former WBU Super Featherweight champion, but lost in each of four attempts to capture a World Title. Manfredy currently has a record of 43-8-1 (32 knockouts).

Manfredy lost two of his first five fights, but then won 23 in a row, including wins over former champions such as Calvin Grove, and Jorge Páez, and top contenders such as Wilson Rodriguez, before landing his first major fight against Gatti, in the latter&#x27;s hometown of Atlantic City. Manfredy, who was an underdog, dominated the fight, knocking Gatti down in the third round, and eventually stopping him on cuts in round 8.

Following this fight, Manfredy fought twice before fighting Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a major HBO television event. Manfredy was stopped in the second round after a barrage of punches. Manfredy called the stoppage premature and stated he was not injured. This was one of Manfredy&#x27;s first fights in his new Christian personality, and celebrated having Kid Rock appear at the match singing for him during his walk-in.

Following this fight, Manfredy knocked out Ivan Robinson in what had been HBO&#x27;s Boxing After Dark&#x27;s highest-rated show of 1999. Manfredy then received another world title shot against Stevie Johnston in 1999, but was thoroughly outboxed. In 2002 Manfredy challenged Paul Spadafora for the International Boxing FederationWorld lightweight title. Spadafora beat Manfredy in a close decision. Manfredy last fought in 2004.

== Training and Promoting ==
In 2017 Manfredy took a position as a trainer and promoter in Crown Point, Indiana in a gym owned by boxer Ricky Carr.

As of 2023 Manfredy has been teaching boxing as a personal trainer. He currently trains his clients at Premier Mixed Martial Arts in Schereville.

<doc id="102637" wikidata="Q545924" url="?curid=102637" title="Dana Carvey">
<text>Dana Thomas Carvey (born June 2, 1955) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, podcaster, screenwriter and producer.

Carvey is best known for his seven seasons on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, from 1986 to 1993, which earned him five consecutive Primetime Emmy Award nominations. He returned to the show during and immediately after the 2024 presidential election to impersonate outgoing US President Joe Biden as well as Trump advisor, businessman, and billionaire Elon Musk.

Carvey is also known for his film roles in comedies such as &quot;Moving&quot; (1988), &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; (1990), &quot;Trapped in Paradise&quot; (1994), and &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; (2002), as well as reprising his role of Garth Algar in the &quot;SNL&quot; spin-off film &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; (1992) and its sequel &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot; (1993).

==Early life==
Carvey was born in Missoula, Montana, the fourth of five (with three older brothers and one younger sister&lt;ref name=&quot;yearbook/1976-Carlmont&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) born to Billie Dahl, a schoolteacher, and William John (Bud) Carvey,&lt;ref name=&quot;smdailyjournal/obituaries/bud&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a high school business teacher. He has some Irish ancestry. Carvey is the brother of Brad Carvey, the engineer/designer of the Video Toaster. The character Garth Algar is loosely based on Brad. Carvey was raised Lutheran.

In 1957, his family moved to Anderson, California, where his father got a teaching job. When he was three years old, his family moved to San Carlos, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area. He attended Tierra Linda Junior High in San Carlos, Carlmont High School in Belmont, California (where he was a member of the Central Coast Section champion cross country team), College of San Mateo in San Mateo, California, and earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in broadcast communications from San Francisco State University. In 1977, he won the San Francisco Stand-Up Comedy Competition.

==Career==
===Early career===
Carvey had a minor role in &quot;Halloween II&quot; in 1981, and co-starred in &quot;One of the Boys&quot; in 1982, a short-lived television sitcom that also starred Mickey Rooney, Nathan Lane, and Meg Ryan. In 1984, Carvey had a small role in Rob Reiner&#x27;s film &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, in which he played a mime, with fellow comedian Billy Crystal (who tells him &quot;&quot;). He appeared in the music video for the Greg Kihn song &quot;Lucky&quot; in 1985. He also appeared in the short-lived film-based action television series &quot;Blue Thunder&quot;. His big break came in 1986, when he co-starred opposite Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster in &quot;Tough Guys&quot;. As a lifelong Douglas fan, Carvey threw in an affectionate impression of his mentor, while describing a hairy scene they did together on a moving train.

Carvey was a finalist for the hosting role on the Nickelodeon TV game show &quot;Double Dare&quot;. He ultimately withdrew his name from consideration after he was cast on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The job would go to Marc Summers.

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===

In 1986, Carvey became a household name when he joined the cast of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. He, along with newcomers Phil Hartman, Kevin Nealon, Jan Hooks, and Victoria Jackson, helped to reverse the show&#x27;s declining popularity and made &quot;SNL&quot; &quot;must-see&quot; TV once again. An important part of the show&#x27;s revival was Carvey&#x27;s breakout character, the Church Lady, the uptight, smug, and pious host of &quot;Church Chat&quot;. Carvey said he based the character on women he knew from church while growing up, who would keep track of other churchgoers&#x27; attendance. He became so associated with the character that later cast members such as Chris Farley referred to Carvey simply as &quot;The Lady&quot;. The Church Lady&#x27;s discontinuation was mentioned in a sketch which satirized the film &quot;Misery&quot; with host Roseanne Barr playing the role of Annie Wilkes.

Carvey&#x27;s other original characters included Garth Algar (from &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;), who was based on his brother; Hans (from &quot;Hans and Franz&quot;); the Grumpy Old Man (from &quot;Weekend Update&quot; appearances); and Ching Chang, a Chinese poultry store owner. Throughout the election and presidency of George H. W. Bush, he was the designated impersonator of the president, making him the lead actor of the regular political sketches on &quot;SNL&quot;.
During the 1992 US presidential election campaign, Carvey also did an impression of independent candidate Ross Perot; in a prime-time special before the election, Carvey played both George H. W. Bush and Perot in a three-way debate with Bill Clinton, played by Phil Hartman. As Perot—recorded and timed to give the appearance of interacting with the live Bush and Clinton—Carvey eschewed the show&#x27;s signature &quot;Live from New York&quot; opening line, telling Bush &quot;Why don&#x27;t you do it, live-boy?&quot; Carvey left &quot;SNL&quot; in 1993, after seven years.

In 1992, Carvey joined Mike Myers in &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;, the film. A sequel, &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;, was filmed and released in 1993.

Carvey&#x27;s &quot;SNL&quot; work won him an Emmy Award in 1993 for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program. He has a total of six Emmy nominations. Carvey has returned to host &quot;SNL&quot; four times, in 1994, 1996, 2000, and 2011 in addition to numerous cameo appearances. 

Carvey nearly rejoined the SNL cast for season 20 in 1994, but ultimately did not rejoin the cast, but did host an episode early in that season.

Carvey made more regular appearances in 2024 to play Joe Biden and Elon Musk in the immediate lead-up and aftermath to the 2024 presidential election. Musk notably criticized Carvey&#x27;s performance of him on X, saying that he did not believe that it sounded like him, which Carvey later agreed with. 

===After &quot;SNL&quot;===
In 1994, Carvey starred in the film &quot;Clean Slate&quot;. The following year, Carvey filmed his first HBO stand-up special &quot;Critic&#x27;s Choice&quot;. The show featured Carvey doing many of his &quot;SNL&quot; impersonations, as well as making fun of the premium channel&#x27;s name, pronouncing it &quot;hobo&quot;.

He turned down a role in &quot;Bad Boys&quot; because he felt overwhelmed as a new father.

He reprised many of his &quot;SNL&quot; characters in 1996 for &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot;, a short-lived prime-time variety show on ABC. The show was most notable for launching Robert Smigel&#x27;s cartoon &quot;The Ambiguously Gay Duo&quot;, as well as the careers of Steve Carell and Stephen Colbert.

In 2002, he returned to films in the spy comedy &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot;. Released a week after former colleague Mike Myers&#x27; successful film &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;, most critics compared the movies and panned Carvey&#x27;s effort. However, the movie did manage about $40 million at the North American box office. In March 2007, review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes ranked the film as the 18th worst-reviewed movie of the 2000s decade, with an approval rating of 1% based on 103 reviews. Comedian and former &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; host Michael J. Nelson named the film the third-worst comedy ever made. Carvey did not appear in a film again until 2011&#x27;s &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;.

In 2004, he ranked number 90 on Comedy Central&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time.

===After &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot;===

Carvey eventually withdrew from the limelight to focus on his family. He later said in an interview that he did not want to be in a career in which his kids would already be grown with him having neglected spending time with them, a major reason for his declining the hosting spot for &quot;Late Night&quot; that ultimately went to Conan O&#x27;Brien. Carvey has said that he generally prefers stand-up comedy to acting in movies and regularly performs lucrative corporate dates, boasting of &quot;a few million-dollar months&quot; during a 2016 Howard Stern interview.

Carvey made an appearance at the 2008 MTV Movie Awards, reprising his &quot;SNL&quot; character Garth Algar with host Mike Myers for a &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; sketch. On June 14, 2008, Carvey filmed a second HBO stand-up special, the first in 13 years, entitled &quot;Squatting Monkeys Tell No Lies&quot;.

In 2010, Carvey appeared in the &quot;Funny or Die&quot; original comedy sketch &quot;Presidential Reunion&quot;. He played the role of President George H. W. Bush alongside other current and former &quot;SNL&quot; president impersonators.

In early 2010, Carvey and comedian/writer Spike Feresten created and starred together in &quot;Spoof&quot;, a sketch comedy pilot for Fox. This included a sketch of a trailer for &quot;Darwin&quot;, a mock film in which he played the evolutionary biologist, as well as a spoof of the hit TV series &quot;Lost&quot;. Both of these sketches can be seen on YouTube. On the animated TV series &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, Carvey voiced Cosmo Cosma&#x27;s con artist brother Schnozmo.

On April 29 and 30, 2016, Carvey recorded two live performances at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts for a Netflix special released later in the year. His two sons, Tom and Dex, opened the show for him.

Carvey was a guest on Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s podcast, &quot;Conan O&#x27;Brien Needs a Friend&quot;, on January 27, 2019. Carvey was subsequently featured in a six episode mini-series of the podcast titled &quot;Deep Dive with Dana Carvey&quot;, released in August 2019.

Carvey has regularly done sketch impressions on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; playing, among others, President Joe Biden and former national security advisor John Bolton.

On August 1, 2019, Carvey appeared on the guest panel of the fourth episode of &quot;Lights Out with David Spade&quot; and also in costume as Tony Montana in a number of later episodes.

===Podcasts===
In 2021, Carvey began hosting the comedy podcast &quot;Fantastic! with Dana Carvey&quot;. The podcast features mini sketches involving Carvey&#x27;s many celebrity impressions, as well as interview segments with Carvey&#x27;s family members and other friends from the stand-up comedy world. That same year, Carvey reprised his role of Garth Algar alongside Myers&#x27; Wayne Campbell in a series of commercials for Uber Eats. The original spot first ran during Super Bowl LV.

In 2022, Carvey began co-hosting the Fly on the Wall podcast with fellow &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alum David Spade. Guests include former cast members and hosts of &quot;SNL&quot;.

In 2024, the &quot;Superfly&quot; video podcast (a spinoff of &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot;) co-hosted by Spade was launched.

==Personal life==
While performing at The Other Cafe in San Francisco, Carvey met and became romantically involved with Paula Zwagerman. Dana and Paula became engaged in 1981 and married in 1983. The couple had two children. The elder son, Dex, died from an accidental drug overdose on November 15, 2023, at the age of 32.

In 1995, Carvey had a home in the San Fernando Valley, and his parents relocated to Murrieta, California, to be near his mother&#x27;s sister, Shirley Miller.&lt;ref name=&quot;crippenandflynnchapels/4641094&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Carvey underwent heart bypass surgery for a blocked coronary artery. The artery was buried deep in myocardium and difficult to find; the surgeon mistakenly&lt;ref name=&quot;people/2000-heart&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; performed the bypass on another accessible artery that was unblocked. As a result, Carvey continued to suffer from angina pectoris and successfully sued for $7.5 million in damages, which he donated to charity; he later underwent additional corrective surgery. He told &quot;Newsday&quot; that, while he was in the hospital for his final angioplasty, Frank Sinatra died in the room adjacent to his. From 2002 to 2010, Carvey took a break to raise his two sons.&lt;ref name=&quot;people/carvey-left-hollywood&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;siriusxm/carvey-sons&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Carvey and his family live in Mill Valley in Marin County, California.

<text>Matra Marconi Space (MMS) was a Franco-British aerospace company.

== History ==
Matra Marconi Space was established in 1990 as a joint venture between the space and telecommunication division of the French conglomerate Matra (Matra Espace) and that of the British GEC group (Marconi Space Systems). The new company was announced in December 1989 and was owned 51% by Matra and 49% by GEC-Marconi. It would have annual sales of £300 million, with £8.7 million in assets from Marconi Space Systems and £10.7 million in assets from Matra Espace.

Claude Goumy, the Managing Director of Matra Espace was the first Managing Director. The first deputy Managing Director was Richard Wignall, the former Managing Director of Marconi Space Systems. The space industry was important to France - almost half the budget of the European Space Agency (ESA) came from the French government.

=== Acquisitions ===
In 1991, British Aerospace was discussing with MMS how to merge their space interests, as well as Robert Bosch GmbH and Deutsche Aerospace.

On 19 July 1994, it acquired British Aerospace Space Systems (a subsidiary of BAe Dynamics with 900 workers) for £56 million. On 11 August 1994, it bought Ferranti Satcomms (from administration), which was based in Poynton in Cheshire. Ferranti Satcomms brought satellite ground station, component and subsystem technologies to the group.

In July 1995, GEC bought 45% of shares in the National Remote Sensing Centre for the company. Also in July 1995, the company was looking to link up with the French state giant Aérospatiale and DASA of Germany to form a Europe-wide space company. The company would (five years later) link up with DASA.

By 1996, the company was turning over more than £1 billion. In the late 1990s, it developed a partnership with the University of Sheffield&#x27;s Sheffield Centre for Earth Observation Science (SCEOS), which researched interferometry.

In November 1997, it announced that it would close the Filton site (former BAe Dynamics) in August 1999, with the planned transfer of 300 of 400 personnel and staff from Bristol to Stevenage. The Filton site specialised in scientific satellites and their computer software; projects included Ulysses, Hubble Space Telescope Solar Arrays, Giotto, Envisat / Polar Platform, Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) and the Cluster spacecraft destroyed in the first flight of Ariane 5. Over 380 staff left the Company and, as a result, MMS lost the ESA prime contract for the Rosetta spacecraft. British Aerospace regained an interest in the company when it merged with GEC&#x27;s Marconi Electronic Systems to form BAE Systems in November 1999.

=== Astrium ===
In late 1998, it was discussing a possible merger with DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG (DASA).
In 2000, it was merged with the space division of DASA to form Astrium.

<text>In probability and statistics, a Bernoulli process (named after Jacob Bernoulli) is a finite or infinite sequence of binary random variables, so it is a discrete-time stochastic process that takes only two values, canonically 0 and 1. The component Bernoulli variables &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; are identically distributed and independent. Prosaically, a Bernoulli process is a repeated coin flipping, possibly with an unfair coin (but with consistent unfairness). Every variable &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; in the sequence is associated with a Bernoulli trial or experiment. They all have the same Bernoulli distribution. Much of what can be said about the Bernoulli process can also be generalized to more than two outcomes (such as the process for a six-sided die); this generalization is known as the Bernoulli scheme.

The problem of determining the process, given only a limited sample of Bernoulli trials, may be called the problem of checking whether a coin is fair.

==Definition==
A &quot;Bernoulli process&quot; is a finite or infinite sequence of independent random variables &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, &quot;X&quot;3, ..., such that

* for each &quot;i&quot;, the value of &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; is either 0 or 1;
* for all values of formula_1, the probability &quot;p&quot; that &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; = 1 is the same.

In other words, a Bernoulli process is a sequence of independent identically distributed Bernoulli trials.

Independence of the trials implies that the process is memoryless, in which past event frequencies have no influence on about future event probability frequencies. In most instances the true value of &quot;p&quot; is unknown, therefore we use past frequencies to asses/forecaste/estimate future events &amp; their probabilities indirectly via applying probabilistic inference upon &quot;p&quot;.

If the process is infinite, then from any point the future trials constitute a Bernoulli process identical to the whole process, the fresh-start property.

=== Interpretation ===

The two possible values of each &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; are often called &quot;success&quot; and &quot;failure&quot;. Thus, when expressed as a number 0 or 1, the outcome may be called the number of successes on the &quot;i&quot;th &quot;trial&quot;.

Two other common interpretations of the values are true or false and yes or no. Under any interpretation of the two values, the individual variables &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; may be called Bernoulli trials with parameter p.

In many applications time passes between trials, as the index i increases. In effect, the trials &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ... &quot;X&quot;i, ... happen at &quot;points in time&quot; 1, 2, ..., &quot;i&quot;, ... That passage of time and the associated notions of &quot;past&quot; and &quot;future&quot; are not necessary, however. Most generally, any &quot;X&quot;i and &quot;X&quot;&quot;j&quot; in the process are simply two from a set of random variables indexed by {1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;}, the finite cases, or by {1, 2, 3, ...}, the infinite cases. 

One experiment with only two possible outcomes, often referred to as &quot;success&quot; and &quot;failure&quot;, usually encoded as 1 and 0, can be modeled as a Bernoulli distribution. Several random variables and probability distributions beside the Bernoullis may be derived from the Bernoulli process:

*The number of successes in the first &quot;n&quot; trials, which has a binomial distribution B(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;p&quot;)
*The number of failures needed to get &quot;r&quot; successes, which has a negative binomial distribution NB(&quot;r&quot;, &quot;p&quot;)
*The number of failures needed to get one success, which has a geometric distribution NB(1, &quot;p&quot;), a special case of the negative binomial distribution

The negative binomial variables may be interpreted as random waiting times.

==Formal definition==
The Bernoulli process can be formalized in the language of probability spaces as a random sequence of independent realisations of a random variable that can take values of heads or tails. The state space for an individual value is denoted by formula_2

===Borel algebra===
Consider the countably infinite direct product of copies of formula_3. It is common to examine either the one-sided set formula_4 or the two-sided set formula_5. There is a natural topology on this space, called the product topology. The sets in this topology are finite sequences of coin flips, that is, finite-length strings of &quot;H&quot; and &quot;T&quot; (&quot;H&quot; stands for heads and &quot;T&quot; stands for tails), with the rest of (infinitely long) sequence taken as &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot;. These sets of finite sequences are referred to as cylinder sets in the product topology. The set of all such strings forms a sigma algebra, specifically, a Borel algebra. This algebra is then commonly written as formula_6 where the elements of formula_7 are the finite-length sequences of coin flips (the cylinder sets).

===Bernoulli measure===
If the chances of flipping heads or tails are given by the probabilities formula_8, then one can define a natural measure on the product space, given by formula_9 (or by formula_10 for the two-sided process). In another word, if a discrete random variable &quot;X&quot; has a &quot;Bernoulli distribution&quot; with parameter &quot;p&quot;, where 0 ≤ &quot;p&quot; ≤ 1, and its probability mass function is given by 

:formula_11 and formula_12. 

We denote this distribution by Ber(&quot;p&quot;). 

Given a cylinder set, that is, a specific sequence of coin flip results formula_13 at times formula_14, the probability of observing this particular sequence is given by 

:formula_15
where &quot;k&quot; is the number of times that &quot;H&quot; appears in the sequence, and &quot;n&quot;−&quot;k&quot; is the number of times that &quot;T&quot; appears in the sequence. There are several different kinds of notations for the above; a common one is to write 
:formula_16
where each formula_17 is a binary-valued random variable with formula_18 in Iverson bracket notation, meaning either formula_19 if formula_20 or formula_21 if formula_22. This probability formula_23 is commonly called the Bernoulli measure.

Note that the probability of any specific, infinitely long sequence of coin flips is exactly zero; this is because formula_24, for any formula_25. A probability equal to 1 implies that any given infinite sequence has measure zero. Nevertheless, one can still say that some classes of infinite sequences of coin flips are far more likely than others, this is given by the asymptotic equipartition property.

To conclude the formal definition, a Bernoulli process is then given by the probability triple formula_26, as defined above.

== Law of large numbers, binomial distribution and central limit theorem==

Let us assume the canonical process with formula_27 represented by formula_28 and formula_29 represented by formula_30. The law of large numbers states that the average of the sequence, i.e., formula_31, will approach the expected value almost certainly, that is, the events which do not satisfy this limit have zero probability. The expectation value of flipping &quot;heads&quot;, assumed to be represented by 1, is given by formula_32. In fact, one has
:formula_33
for any given random variable formula_17 out of the infinite sequence of Bernoulli trials that compose the Bernoulli process.

One is often interested in knowing how often one will observe &quot;H&quot; in a sequence of &quot;n&quot; coin flips. This is given by simply counting: Given &quot;n&quot; successive coin flips, that is, given the set of all possible strings of length &quot;n&quot;, the number &quot;N&quot;(&quot;k&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) of such strings that contain &quot;k&quot; occurrences of &quot;H&quot; is given by the binomial coefficient 
:formula_35

If the probability of flipping heads is given by &quot;p&quot;, then the total probability of seeing a string of length &quot;n&quot; with &quot;k&quot; heads is
:formula_36
where formula_37.
The probability measure thus defined is known as the Binomial distribution.

As we can see from the above formula that, if n=1, the &quot;Binomial distribution&quot; will turn into a &quot;Bernoulli distribution&quot;. So we can know that the &quot;Bernoulli distribution&quot; is exactly a special case of &quot;Binomial distribution&quot; when n equals to 1.

Of particular interest is the question of the value of formula_38 for a sufficiently long sequences of coin flips, that is, for the limit formula_39. In this case, one may make use of Stirling&#x27;s approximation to the factorial, and write
:formula_40

Inserting this into the expression for &quot;P&quot;(&quot;k&quot;,&quot;n&quot;), one obtains the Normal distribution; this is the content of the central limit theorem, and this is the simplest example thereof.

The combination of the law of large numbers, together with the central limit theorem, leads to an interesting and perhaps surprising result: the asymptotic equipartition property. Put informally, one notes that, yes, over many coin flips, one will observe &quot;H&quot; exactly &quot;p&quot; fraction of the time, and that this corresponds exactly with the peak of the Gaussian. The asymptotic equipartition property essentially states that this peak is infinitely sharp, with infinite fall-off on either side. That is, given the set of all possible infinitely long strings of &quot;H&quot; and &quot;T&quot; occurring in the Bernoulli process, this set is partitioned into two: those strings that occur with probability 1, and those that occur with probability 0. This partitioning is known as the Kolmogorov 0-1 law.

The size of this set is interesting, also, and can be explicitly determined: the logarithm of it is exactly the entropy of the Bernoulli process. Once again, consider the set of all strings of length &quot;n&quot;. The size of this set is formula_41. Of these, only a certain subset are likely; the size of this set is formula_42 for formula_43. By using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, putting it into the expression for &quot;P&quot;(&quot;k&quot;,&quot;n&quot;), solving for the location and width of the peak, and finally taking formula_39 one finds that

:formula_45

This value is the Bernoulli entropy of a Bernoulli process. Here, &quot;H&quot; stands for entropy; not to be confused with the same symbol &quot;H&quot; standing for &quot;heads&quot;.

John von Neumann posed a question about the Bernoulli process regarding the possibility of a given process being isomorphic to another, in the sense of the isomorphism of dynamical systems. The question long defied analysis, but was finally and completely answered with the Ornstein isomorphism theorem. This breakthrough resulted in the understanding that the Bernoulli process is unique and universal; in a certain sense, it is the single most random process possible; nothing is &#x27;more&#x27; random than the Bernoulli process (although one must be careful with this informal statement; certainly, systems that are mixing are, in a certain sense, &quot;stronger&quot; than the Bernoulli process, which is merely ergodic but not mixing. However, such processes do not consist of independent random variables: indeed, many purely deterministic, non-random systems can be mixing).

==Dynamical systems==
The Bernoulli process can also be understood to be a dynamical system, as an example of an ergodic system and specifically, a measure-preserving dynamical system, in one of several different ways. One way is as a shift space, and the other is as an odometer. These are reviewed below.

===Bernoulli shift===

One way to create a dynamical system out of the Bernoulli process is as a shift space. There is a natural translation symmetry on the product space formula_46 given by the shift operator
:formula_47

The Bernoulli measure, defined above, is translation-invariant; that is, given any cylinder set formula_48, one has
:formula_49
and thus the Bernoulli measure is a Haar measure; it is an invariant measure on the product space.

Instead of the probability measure formula_50, consider instead some arbitrary function formula_51. The pushforward 
:formula_52
defined by formula_53 is again some function formula_54 Thus, the map formula_55 induces another map formula_56 on the space of all functions formula_54 That is, given some formula_51, one defines
:formula_59
The map formula_56 is a linear operator, as (obviously) one has formula_61 and formula_62 for functions formula_63 and constant formula_64. This linear operator is called the transfer operator or the &quot;Ruelle–Frobenius–Perron operator&quot;. This operator has a spectrum, that is, a collection of eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenvalues. The largest eigenvalue is the Frobenius–Perron eigenvalue, and in this case, it is 1. The associated eigenvector is the invariant measure: in this case, it is the Bernoulli measure. That is, formula_65

If one restricts formula_56 to act on polynomials, then the eigenfunctions are (curiously) the Bernoulli polynomials! This coincidence of naming was presumably not known to Bernoulli.

=== The 2x mod 1 map===
The map &quot;T&quot; : [0,1) → [0,1), formula_67 preserves the [[Lebesgue measure]].

The above can be made more precise. Given an infinite string of binary digits formula_68 write
:formula_69
The resulting formula_70 is a real number in the unit interval formula_71 The shift formula_55 induces a homomorphism, also called formula_55, on the unit interval. Since formula_74 one can see that formula_75 This map is called the dyadic transformation; for the doubly-infinite sequence of bits formula_76 the induced homomorphism is the Baker&#x27;s map.

Consider now the space of functions in formula_70. Given some formula_78 one can find that
:formula_79

Restricting the action of the operator formula_56 to functions that are on polynomials, one finds that it has a discrete spectrum given by 
:formula_81
where the formula_82 are the Bernoulli polynomials. Indeed, the Bernoulli polynomials obey the identity
:formula_83

===The Cantor set===
Note that the sum
:formula_84
gives the Cantor function, as conventionally defined. This is one reason why the set formula_85 is sometimes called the Cantor set.

===Odometer===

Another way to create a dynamical system is to define an odometer. Informally, this is exactly what it sounds like: just &quot;add one&quot; to the first position, and let the odometer &quot;roll over&quot; by using carry bits as the odometer rolls over. This is nothing more than base-two addition on the set of infinite strings. Since addition forms a group (mathematics), and the Bernoulli process was already given a topology, above, this provides a simple example of a topological group.

In this case, the transformation formula_55 is given by
:formula_87 

It leaves the Bernoulli measure invariant only for the special case of formula_88 (the &quot;fair coin&quot;); otherwise not. Thus, formula_55 is a measure preserving dynamical system in this case, otherwise, it is merely a conservative system.

==Bernoulli sequence==
The term &quot;Bernoulli sequence&quot; is often used informally to refer to a realization of a Bernoulli process.
However, the term has an entirely different formal definition as given below.

Suppose a Bernoulli process formally defined as a single random variable (see preceding section). For every infinite sequence &quot;x&quot; of coin flips, there is a sequence of integers

:formula_90

called the &quot;Bernoulli sequence&quot; associated with the Bernoulli process. For example, if &quot;x&quot; represents a sequence of coin flips, then the associated Bernoulli sequence is the list of natural numbers or time-points for which the coin toss outcome is &quot;heads&quot;.

So defined, a Bernoulli sequence formula_91 is also a random subset of the index set, the natural numbers formula_92.

Almost all Bernoulli sequences formula_91 are ergodic sequences.

==Randomness extraction==

From any Bernoulli process one may derive a Bernoulli process with &quot;p&quot; = 1/2 by the von Neumann extractor, the earliest randomness extractor, which actually extracts uniform randomness.

=== Basic von Neumann extractor ===
Represent the observed process as a sequence of zeroes and ones, or bits, and group that input stream in non-overlapping pairs of successive bits, such as (11)(00)(10)... . Then for each pair,
* if the bits are equal, discard;
* if the bits are not equal, output the first bit.

This table summarizes the computation.

For example, an input stream of eight bits &quot;10011011&quot; would by grouped into pairs as &quot;(10)(01)(10)(11)&quot;. Then, according to the table above, these pairs are translated into the output of the procedure:
&quot;(1)(0)(1)()&quot; (=&quot;101&quot;).

In the output stream 0 and 1 are equally likely, as 10 and 01 are equally likely in the original, both having probability &quot;p&quot;(1−&quot;p&quot;) = (1−&quot;p&quot;)&quot;p&quot;. This extraction of uniform randomness does not require the input trials to be independent, only uncorrelated. More generally, it works for any exchangeable sequence of bits: all sequences that are finite rearrangements are equally likely.

The von Neumann extractor uses two input bits to produce either zero or one output bits, so the output is shorter than the input by a factor of at least 2. On average the computation discards proportion &quot;p&quot;2 + (1 − &quot;p&quot;)2 of the input pairs(00 and 11), which is near one when &quot;p&quot; is near zero or one, and is minimized at 1/4 when &quot;p&quot; = 1/2 for the original process (in which case the output stream is 1/4 the length of the input stream on average).

Von Neumann (classical) main operation pseudocode:

if (Bit1 ≠ Bit2) {
 output(Bit1)


=== Iterated von Neumann extractor ===

This decrease in efficiency, or waste of randomness present in the input stream, can be mitigated by iterating the algorithm over the input data. This way the output can be made to be &quot;arbitrarily close to the entropy bound&quot;. 

The iterated version of the von Neumann algorithm, also known as advanced multi-level strategy (AMLS), was introduced by Yuval Peres in 1992. It works recursively, recycling &quot;wasted randomness&quot; from two sources: the sequence of discard-non-discard, and the values of discarded pairs (0 for 00, and 1 for 11). It relies on the fact that, given the sequence already generated, both of those sources are still exchangeable sequences of bits, and thus eligible for another round of extraction. While such generation of additional sequences can be iterated infinitely to extract all available entropy, an infinite amount of computational resources is required, therefore the number of iterations is typically fixed to a low value – this value either fixed in advance, or calculated at runtime.

More concretely, on an input sequence, the algorithm consumes the input bits in pairs, generating output together with two new sequences, () gives AMLS paper notation:

(If the length of the input is odd, the last bit is completely discarded.) Then the algorithm is applied recursively to each of the two new sequences, until the input is empty.

Example: The input stream from the AMLS paper, &quot;11001011101110&quot; using 1 for H and 0 for T, is processed this way:


Starting from step 1, the input is a concatenation of sequence 2 and sequence 1 from the previous step (the order is arbitrary but should be fixed). The final output is &quot;()()(1)()(1)()(1)(1)()()(0)(0)()(0)(1)(1)()(1)&quot; (=&quot;1111000111&quot;), so from 14 bits of input 10 bits of output were generated, as opposed to 3 bits through the von Neumann algorithm alone. The constant output of exactly 2 bits per round per bit pair (compared with a variable none to 1 bit in classical VN) also allows for constant-time implementations which are resistant to timing attacks.

Von Neumann–Peres (iterated) main operation pseudocode:

if (Bit1 ≠ Bit2) {
 output(1, Sequence1)
 output(Bit1)
} else {
 output(0, Sequence1)
 output(Bit1, Sequence2)

Another tweak was presented in 2016, based on the observation that the Sequence2 channel doesn&#x27;t provide much throughput, and a hardware implementation with a finite number of levels can benefit from discarding it earlier in exchange for processing more levels of Sequence1.

<doc id="102652" wikidata="Q1490400" url="?curid=102652" title="Lagardère Group">
<text>Lagardère S.A. () is an international group with operations in over 40 countries. Based in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, the group was founded and created in 1992 by Jean-Luc Lagardère under the name Matra, Hachette &amp; Lagardère.

Headed by Arnaud Lagardère, it is focused around two priority divisions: Lagardère Publishing and Lagardère Travel Retail. While its book and e-publishing division (Lagardère Publishing) includes the major imprint Hachette Livre, its Travel Retail unit includes store retail, largely in airports and railway stations.

The group&#x27;s business scope also comprises other activities, mainly including Lagardère News (&quot;Paris Match&quot;, &quot;Le Journal du Dimanche&quot; and the Elle brand licence), Lagardère Radio (Europe 1, Europe 2, RFM), Lagardère Live Entertainment (production of concerts and shows and venue management) and Lagardère Paris Racing (sports club).

On November 21, 2023, Vivendi completed the purchase of a majority stake (60%) in Lagardère.

By the following year, Vivendi announced a major breakup of its businesses. As a result, Vivendi&#x27;s shares in Lagadère were transferred to Louis Hachette Group prior to its listing on December of that year.

== History ==

=== Hachette and Matra, the foundation of Lagardère ===
The starting point for what would become the Lagardère Group was Louis Hachette&#x27;s acquisition of Parisian bookstore Brédif in 1826. Hachette published magazines dedicated to public entertainment (&quot;Le Journal pour Tous&quot; [&quot;Everyone&#x27;s Newspaper&quot;], 1855) and also took part in publishing the (&quot;Dictionary of the French Language&quot;) with his friend Littré, starting in 1863. In 1953, Hachette launched Le Livre de Poche with Henri Filipacchi.

Created in 1945, Matra (Mechanics/Aviation/Traction) was the company behind several technological projects, including creating a twin-engine aeroplane prototype able to travel at 800 km/h and breaking the sound barrier at Mach 1.4 in vertical flight for the first time in Europe. In 1990, Matra Espace and the aerospace division of Gec Marconi came together to create Matra Marconi Space. Matra Hautes Technologies joined the aerospace industry and officially became Aerospatiale Matra on June 11, 1999. EADS, or the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, later Airbus, was founded on July 10, 2000, from the merger of Aérospatiale Matra SA, Aeronautics SA, and DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG. It officially launched the A380 program that same year. The aircraft would make its first flight in 2005.

=== Jean-Luc Lagardère and the birth of the group ===
In 1963, Jean-Luc Lagardère was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Matra, with 1,450 employees. In 1981, he became head of Hachette. In 1988, the group acquired Grolier Encyclopedias in the USA, its first overseas acquisition. In 1992, after a major year-long restructuring, Matra Hachette and Lagardère group were created. In 1990, Jean-Luc Lagardère turned to television and became head of La Cinq, which had been suffering from financial problems since it began operations in 1986. The network&#x27;s financial problems would worsen after Lagardère took control, and La Cinq ultimately ceased operations on 12 April 1992 (it would be replaced by France 5 in late 1994).

=== Arnaud Lagardère and the group&#x27;s refocus on media ===
In 1994, Hachette Livre launched the first multimedia encyclopedia, Axis. Also in 1994, Matra Hachette Multimedia presented EPSIS, the first image-substitution process for advertising. In 1998, Hachette Multimedia was born of the consolidation of the multimedia division of Hachette Livre and Grolier Interactive (online educational services). A strategic agreement signed in 2000 by Lagardère and Deutsche Telekom to provide Internet service led to the merger of T-Online and Club-Internet.

In 1995, Hachette acquired UCS, Canada&#x27;s leading newsstand chain, and became the third largest operator in the international retail press trade. In 1996, Hachette Livre acquired the Hatier Group. In 1997, Hachette Livre won a string of literary prizes, including the Prix Goncourt and the Prix de l&#x27;Académie française with La Bataille (The Battle) by Patrick Rambaud (Grasset). That same year, Europe 1 and Club-Internet launched Europe Info. In 2000, Hachette Distribution Services created Relay, an international brand specializing in selling media products at public points of sale. That same year, Lagardère and Canal+ got into digital television. In 2001, Lagardère acquired the Virgin Stores brand and Virgin Megastore in France. Hachette Filipacchi Médias has continued its growth by taking a 42% stake in the Marie Claire Group.

=== From a conglomerate to a media-diversified group ===

With the death of Jean-Luc Lagardère on March 14, 2003, Arnaud Lagardère was appointed General Partner of Lagardère SCA. That same year, Lagardère sold off its interest in Renault as well as its automotive engineering business. In 2004, the Group acquired Vivendi Universal Publishing. After antitrust review, Lagardère kept 40% of the company, including the imprints Larousse, Dalloz, Dunod, Nathan, Armand Colin and Sedes, as well as the Spanish division Grupo Anaya. The remainder was sold in 2004 under the name of Editis. Lagardère took advantage of the growth of TNT to launch the youth channel Gulli in partnership with France Télévisions.

In 2006, Arnaud Lagardère created Lagardère Sports, a new subsidiary of the Group specializing in sports economics and sporting rights. Lagardère also became the new franchisee of the Croix-Catelan (Bois de Boulogne, Paris) and the Rue Eblé sports and recreation sites, for a twenty-year period. On May 31, 2010, Lagardère Sports changed its name and became Lagardère Unlimited, a new branch of the group specializing in the sport industry and entertainment.

On July 8, 2015, Lagardère Services was renamed Lagardère Travel Retail. On September 15 of that year, agencies of the Lagardère Group announced that they were being renamed under a common corporate brand: Lagardère Sports and Entertainment. This new brand would replace the brand of Lagardère Unlimited as one of the four divisions of the Lagardère Group. In addition, all sports marketing agencies within this division, including Sportfive, World Sport Group, IEC in Sports, Sports Marketing and Management and Lagardère Unlimited Inc., would be unified under a single commercial brand, Lagardère Sports, with all entertainment businesses under the brand Lagardère Live Entertainment.

=== 2010 shareholders meeting ===

Seventeen years after the creation of the limited partnership disputed by an American activist, the SCA (the French limited partnership with shares) was confirmed by nearly 80% of shareholders at the Shareholders Meeting on April 27, 2010.

=== Agreement between Lagardère SCA and Hearst Corporation ===

On March 28, 2011, Lagardère SCA signed a contract to sell its international magazine business, totaling 102 titles, to Hearst Corporation for €651 million. The transaction included a Master License Agreement (MLA) relating to the ELLE trademark in the 15 countries affected by the transfer, in return for which the Group would receive an annual recurring royalty payment. Lagardère would retain complete ownership of its magazine business operations in France and of its ELLE trademark throughout the world. The closing of the transaction remained subject to approval by local partners in certain countries as well as to certain customary governmental approvals and antitrust clearances in certain jurisdictions.

=== Sale of endurance sports division to WTC ===

In January 2016, Lagardère sold the endurance sports division to the World Triathlon Corporation. The transaction included the ITU World Triathlon Series races in Hamburg, Abu Dhabi, Kapstadt, Leeds and Stockholm; other running events like the Hamburg-Marathon, Hawkes Bay International Marathon, Marathon de Bordeaux, Queenstown Marathon and The Music Runs; and cycling events like the Cyclassics Hamburg, Velothon Berlin, Velothon Wales, Velothon Copenhagen, Velothon Stockholm and Velothon Stuttgart.

=== Sale of most of the media assets and sports agency ===

Since the first half of 2018, a plan to sell the Group&#x27;s media assets (excluding &quot;Paris Match&quot;, &quot;Le Journal du Dimanche&quot;, Europe 1, Europe 2, RFM and the &quot;Elle&quot; brand licence) was underway at Lagardère Active. The Group had already divested a large number of assets, including international radio operations, the main digital assets (including e-Health), and the interest in Marie Claire. In 2019, Lagardère finalised the sale of most of the magazine publishing titles in France, the TV businesses, the stake in Mezzo and Disney Hachette Presse.

The Lagardère group finalized the sale of 75% of Lagardère Sports (excluding Lagardère Live Entertainment) to Hamburg-based private equity firm H.I.G. Capital on April 22, 2020.

In May 2020, the Group resisted a demand for the replacement of most of the board members, submitted by Amber Capital, its new largest shareholder. In August, peer French media conglomerate Vivendi raised its stake in the Group to 23.5%, the highest among all shareholders, including Amber (which raised its own by 2% to 20%). It made a pact with the fund in which the two jointly requested four seats, three for Amber and one for Vivendi, on the board.

In November 2020, Lagardère Studios, the entertainment television division of Lagardère Active was sold to French-based media production and distribution company Mediawan. In July 2021, Lagardère Sports was fully divested by the sale of remaining 25% to H.I.G. Capital.

=== Recent acquisitions ===

Lagardère Publishing acquired Perseus Books (2016), Bookouture (2017), La Plage (2018), Worthy Publishing Group (2018), Gigamic (2019), Blackrock Games (2019), Short Books (2019), Laurence King Publishing (2020), Workman Publishing (2021) and Welbeck Publishing (2022).

===Self-censorship===
In 2022 the Financial Times reported that the Lagardère Group&#x27;s Octopus Books had censored references in books to issues seen as sensitive in China, including information about Taiwan. One book had an entire section about Taiwan cut. The censorship was implemented to allow Octopus to continue to use low-cost Chinese book printers.

Until 30 June 2021, the management structure of Lagardère reflects its status as a société en commandite par actions (partnership limited by shares): the firm is led by general and managing partner Arnaud Lagardère, who heads an executive committee comprising two co-managing partners (Pierre Leroy and Thierry Funck-Brentano), spokesperson and chief of external relations Ramzi Khiroun and chief financial officer Sophie Stabile.

At the end of 2013, Lagardère acquired the Dutch company Gerzon, including Gerzon Schiphol, Gerzon Duty Free and Gerzon Import.

<text>In the theory of probability and statistics, a Bernoulli trial (or binomial trial) is a random experiment with exactly two possible outcomes, &quot;success&quot; and &quot;failure&quot;, in which the probability of success is the same every time the experiment is conducted. It is named after Jacob Bernoulli, a 17th-century Swiss mathematician, who analyzed them in his &quot;&quot; (1713).

The mathematical formalization and advanced formulation of the Bernoulli trial is known as the Bernoulli process.

Since a Bernoulli trial has only two possible outcomes, it can be framed as a &quot;yes or no&quot; question. For example:

*Is the top card of a shuffled deck an ace?
*Was the newborn child a girl? (See human sex ratio.)

Success and failure are in this context labels for the two outcomes, and should not be construed literally or as value judgments. More generally, given any probability space, for any event (set of outcomes), one can define a Bernoulli trial according to whether the event occurred or not (event or complementary event). Examples of Bernoulli trials include:

*Flipping a coin. In this context, obverse (&quot;heads&quot;) conventionally denotes success and reverse (&quot;tails&quot;) denotes failure. A fair coin has the probability of success 0.5 by definition. In this case, there are exactly two possible outcomes.
*Rolling a die, where a six is &quot;success&quot; and everything else a &quot;failure&quot;. In this case, there are six possible outcomes, and the event is a six; the complementary event &quot;not a six&quot; corresponds to the other five possible outcomes.
*In conducting a political opinion poll, choosing a voter at random to ascertain whether that voter will vote &quot;yes&quot; in an upcoming referendum.

==Preliminary==
Suppose there exists an experiment consiting of indepently repeated trials, each of which has only two possible outcomes; called experimental Bernoulli trials. The collection of formula_1 experimental realizations of success (1) and failure (0) will be defined by a Bernoulli random variable: formula_2 | formula_3 Let formula_4 be the probability of success in a Bernoulli trial, and formula_5 be the probability of failure. Then the probability of success and the probability of failure sum to one, since these are complementary events: &quot;success&quot; and &quot;failure&quot; are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Thus, one has the following relations:
:formula_6

Alternatively, these can be stated in terms of odds: given probability &quot;formula_4&quot; of success and &quot;formula_5&quot; of failure, the &quot;odds for&quot; are formula_9 and the &quot;odds against&quot; are formula_10 These can also be expressed as numbers, by dividing, yielding the odds for, formula_11, and the odds against, formula_12:
:formula_13
These are multiplicative inverses, so they multiply to 1, with the following relations:
:formula_14

In the case that a Bernoulli trial is representing an event from finitely many equally likely outcomes, where &quot;formula_15&quot; of the outcomes are success and &quot;formula_16&quot; of the outcomes are failure, the odds for are formula_17 and the odds against are formula_18 This yields the following formulas for probability and odds:
:formula_19
Here the odds are computed by dividing the number of outcomes, not the probabilities, but the proportion is the same, since these ratios only differ by multiplying both terms by the same constant factor.

Random variables describing Bernoulli trials are often encoded using the convention that 1 = &quot;success&quot;, 0 = &quot;failure&quot;.

Closely related to a Bernoulli trial is a binomial experiment, which consists of a fixed number formula_20 of statistically independent Bernoulli trials, each with a probability of success formula_4, and counts the number of successes. A random variable corresponding to a binomial experiment is denoted by formula_22, and is said to have a &quot;binomial distribution&quot;.
The probability of exactly formula_23 successes in the experiment formula_22 is given by:
:formula_25

where formula_26 is a binomial coefficient.

Bernoulli trials may also lead to negative binomial distributions (which count the number of successes in a series of repeated Bernoulli trials until a specified number of failures are seen), as well as various other distributions.

When multiple Bernoulli trials are performed, each with its own probability of success, these are sometimes referred to as Poisson trials.

==Examples==

===Tossing coins===
Consider the simple experiment where a fair coin is tossed four times. Find the probability that exactly two of the tosses result in heads.

====Solution====

For this experiment, let a heads be defined as a &quot;success&quot; and a tails as a &quot;failure.&quot; Because the coin is assumed to be fair, the probability of success is formula_27. Thus, the probability of failure, formula_5, is given by
:formula_29.

Using the equation above, the probability of exactly two tosses out of four total tosses resulting in a heads is given by:
:formula_30

===Rolling dice===
What is probability that when three independent fair six-sided dice are rolled, exactly two yield sixes?

====Solution====

On one die, the probability of rolling a six, formula_31. Thus, the probability of not rolling a six, formula_32.

As above, the probability of exactly two sixes out of three,
:formula_33

<text>SOGEADE (Société de gestion de l&#x27;aéronautique, de la défense et de l&#x27;espace) was a French intermediate holding company. It was dissolved in 2013.
== History ==
SOGEADE was created solely to hold French interests in the newly founded EADS (Airbus), as an intermediate holding company, which were owned by the state of France (through SOGEPA) and Lagardère Group (Désirade). In 2005, SOGEADE had the same shares holding ratio with Daimler AG for 29.9%.

In 2006 Daimler and Lagardère agreed to sell 7.5% shares each to the open public. In 2007 Daimler agreed to sell 7.5% shares of Airbus to Dedalus while Lagardère issued mandatory exchangeable bonds for the 7.5% shares of Airbus to Natixis. In 2013 the French State&#x27;s portion of ownership was transferred to SOGEPA, while SOGEADE became the wholly owned subsidiary of Lagardère. Soon later Lagardère sold all the shares.

<text>The Memory of Whiteness is a science fiction novel written by Kim Stanley Robinson and published in September 1985.

==Theme==
It shares with the Mars trilogy a focus on human colonization of the Solar System and depicts a grand tour that travels from the outer planets inward toward the Sun, visiting many human colonies along the way. The different human societies on the various planets and planetoids visited are depicted in detail.

==Plot summary==
The purpose of the tour is to stage concerts by the &quot;Holywelkin Orchestra&quot;, a futuristic musical instrument played by a selected master. Readers follow the Orchestra and its entourage together with a journalist, who after some time detects a conspiracy that seems to be connected with a group of gray-clad, sun-worshipping monks. The tour ends near the planet Mercury in a solar station belonging to these &quot;Grays&quot;, which controls the white line energy source for the whole Solar System.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Memory of Whiteness&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #76, and stated that &quot;this is impressive for its scope and feel of connecting the two cultures: both music and multidimensional physics &quot;sound&quot; convincing.&quot;

<text>Stevens Point is a city in and the county seat of Portage County, Wisconsin, United States. Its population was 25,666 as of the 2020 census. It forms the core of the Stevens Point micropolitan statistical area, which had a population of 70,377 in 2020.

The city was incorporated in 1858. Stevens Point is home to the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point and a campus of Mid-State Technical College.

==History==
Historically part of the Menominee homelands, a three-mile strip along the Wisconsin River was ceded to the United States in an 1836 treaty. In 1854 the Menominee made its last treaty with the U.S., gathering on a reservation on the Wolf River. In the Menominee language it is called &quot;Pasīpahkīhnen&quot; which means &quot;It juts out as land&quot; or &quot;point of land&quot;.

Stevens Point was named after George Stevens, who operated a grocery and supply business on the Wisconsin River during the extensive logging of interior Wisconsin. The river was used by logging companies to float logs to market. Loggers on the river found this a convenient stopping point, as the river bends slightly and the operation was from far upstream. The town developed from Stevens&#x27;s post and was named for him.

In 1845, the postal service came to Stevens Point and with this improvement in communications, the population tripled within 20 years.

In 1847, the first plat was laid out of what became the City of Stevens Point, including the Public Square. The town square was originally an area next to the Wisconsin River where professionals, craftsmen, businessmen, and loggers gathered before their river journeys, bringing revenue to the area. As years went by, the area around the town square grew as logging increased.

Most buildings were first built with readily available wood. Many cases of early fires were reported from 1850–1890. Around 1880, buildings began to be built of brick and sandstone.

<text>The Viridian Design Movement was an aesthetic movement focused on concepts from bright green environmentalism. The name was chosen to refer to a shade of green that does not quite look natural, indicating that the movement was about innovative design and technology, in contrast with the &quot;leaf green&quot; of traditional environmentalism. The movement tied together environmental design, techno-progressivism, and global citizenship. It was founded in 1998 by Bruce Sterling, a postcyberpunk science fiction author. Sterling always remained the central figure in the movement, with Alex Steffen perhaps the next best-known. Steffen, Jamais Cascio, and Jon Lebkowsky, along with some other frequent contributors to Sterling&#x27;s Viridian notes, formed the Worldchanging blog. Sterling wrote the introduction to Worldchanging&#x27;s book (&quot;Worldchanging: A Users Guide for the 21st Century&quot;), which (according to Ross Robertson) is considered the definitive volume on bright green thinking. Sterling formally closed the Viridian movement in 2008, saying there was no need to continue its work now that bright green environmentalism had emerged.

<text>The Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte () or simply Vaux-le-Vicomte is a Baroque French château located in Maincy, near Melun, southeast of Paris in the Seine-et-Marne department of Île-de-France.

Built between 1658 and 1661 for Nicolas Fouquet, Marquis de Belle Île, Viscount of Melun and Vaux, the Superintendent of Finances of Louis XIV, the château was an influential work of architecture in mid-17th-century Europe. At Vaux-le-Vicomte, the architect Louis Le Vau, the landscape architect André Le Nôtre and the painter-decorator Charles Le Brun worked together on a large-scale project for the first time. Their collaboration marked the beginning of the Louis XIV style combining architecture, interior design and landscape design. The garden&#x27;s pronounced visual axis is an example of this style.

==History==

Once a small château between the royal residences of Vincennes and Fontainebleau, the estate of Vaux-le-Vicomte was purchased in 1641 by Nicolas Fouquet, an ambitious 26-year-old member of the Parlement of Paris. Fouquet was an avid patron of the arts, attracting many artists with his generosity.

When Fouquet became King Louis XIV&#x27;s Superintendent of Finances in 1656, he commissioned Le Vau, Le Brun and Le Nôtre to renovate his estate and garden to match his grand ambition. Fouquet&#x27;s artistic and cultivated personality subsequently brought out the best in the three.

To secure the necessary grounds for the elaborate plans for Vaux-le-Vicomte&#x27;s garden and castle, Fouquet purchased and demolished three villages. The displaced villagers were then employed in the upkeep and maintenance of the gardens. It was said to have employed 18 thousand workers and cost as much as 16 million livres.

The château and its patron became for a short time a focus for fine feasts, literature and arts. The fabulist and poet Jean de La Fontaine and the playwright Molière were among the artists close to Fouquet. At the inauguration of Vaux-le-Vicomte, a Molière play was performed, along with a dinner event organized by François Vatel and an impressive firework show.

===Fête and arrest===
The château was lavish, refined and dazzling to behold, but those characteristics proved tragic for its owner: the king had Fouquet arrested shortly after a famous fête that took place on 17 August 1661, where Molière&#x27;s play &#x27;Les Fâcheux&#x27; debuted. The celebration had been too impressive and the superintendent&#x27;s home too luxurious. Fouquet&#x27;s intentions were to flatter the king: part of Vaux-le-Vicomte was actually constructed specifically for the king, but Fouquet&#x27;s plan backfired. Jean-Baptiste Colbert led the king to believe that his minister&#x27;s magnificence was funded by the misappropriation of public funds. Colbert, who then replaced Fouquet as superintendent of finances, arrested him. Later, Voltaire was to sum up the famous fête: &quot;On 17 August, at six in the evening Fouquet was the King of France: at two in the morning he was nobody.&quot; La Fontaine wrote describing the fête and shortly afterwards penned his &quot;Elégie aux nymphes de Vaux&quot;.

===After Fouquet===
After Fouquet was arrested and imprisoned for life and his wife exiled, Vaux-le-Vicomte was placed under sequestration. The king seized, confiscated or purchased 120 tapestries, the statues and all the orange trees from Vaux-le-Vicomte. He then sent the team of artists (Le Vau, Le Nôtre and Le Brun) to design what would be a much larger project than Vaux-le-Vicomte, the palace and gardens of Versailles.

Madame Fouquet recovered her property 10 years later and retired there with her eldest son. In 1705, after the death of her husband and son, she decided to put Vaux-le-Vicomte up for sale.

===Recent history===

Marshal Claude Louis Hector de Villars became the new owner without first seeing the château. In 1764, the Marshal&#x27;s son sold the estate to the Duke of Praslin, whose descendants maintained the property for over a century. It is sometimes mistakenly reported that the château was the scene of a murder in 1847, when Charles de Choiseul-Praslin killed his wife in her bedroom. He did so at their Paris residence, rather than at Vaux-le-Vicomte.

In 1875, after thirty years of neglect, the estate was sold to in a public auction. &quot;He came for the [Charles] Le Brun paintings, especially those on the ceiling of the Chambre des Muses – he loved art,&quot; according to descendant Alexandre de Vogüé. The château was empty, some of the outbuildings had fallen into ruin and the gardens were completely overgrown. Restoration and refurbishment began under the direction of the architect Gabriel-Hippolyte Destailleur, assisted by the landscape architect Elie Lainé. When Sommier died in 1908, the château and the gardens had recovered their original appearance. His son, Edme Sommier, and his daughter-in-law completed the task. His descendants continue to preserve the château, which remains privately owned.

Since 1967, the owner has been Patrice de Vogüé, Alfred Sommier&#x27;s great-grandson, who received it as a wedding present, with his wife Cristina, the Count and Countess de Vogüé. By that time, the estate contained only a few pieces that had originally been owned by Fouquet. For some time, the family occupied the first floor, and then the refurbished stables, of this largest private château in France with its 1,235 acres of gardens.

In 1968, the property was opened for public tours. A major restoration was completed starting in 1976 and it was continuing in 2017; the roof repair alone took six years. The Baroque ceiling in the Chambre des Muses, &quot;decorated by Charles Le Brun&#x27;s workshop&quot;, was restored in 2016–2017 and was first shown to the public in March 2017. The business is now administered by their three sons: Alexandre, Jean-Charles and Ascanio de Vogüé. &quot;We don’t care about the aristocratic part of this life,&quot; said Alexandre de Vogüé, but they are determined to continue the preservation. &quot;We have a ten-year plan, detailing what to do and when; a plan that includes a project of infrastructure restoration, restoration of the garden, and smaller projects; all with anticipated costs next to it. We make this list public for our donors, and people can sponsor a special project, such as restoring a statue in the garden,&quot; Alexandre told a reporter in 2017.

Approximately 300,000 visitors arrive each year, 75% of them from France. Recognized by the state as a &quot;monument historique&quot;, the property is open most of the year, but closed for approximately two months in winter, 6 January to 22 March in 2019, for example. During the Christmas season, major decorations are installed: 150 trees, 10,000 items and 4,000 metres of garlands and lights, as well as a giant illuminated squirrel and angel, in 2018.

==Features==
=== Architecture ===
The château is situated near the northern end of a 1.5-km long north–south axis with the entrance front facing north. Its elevations are perfectly symmetrical to either side of this axis. Somewhat surprisingly the interior plan is also nearly completely symmetrical with few differences between the eastern and western halves. The two rooms in the centre, the entrance vestibule to the north and the oval salon to the south, were originally an open-air loggia, dividing the château into two distinct sections. The interior decoration of these two rooms was therefore more typical of an outdoor setting. Three sets of three arches, those on the entrance front, three more between the vestibule and the salon, and the three leading from the salon to the garden are all aligned and permitted the arriving visitor to see through to the central axis of the garden even before entering the château. The exterior arches could be closed with iron gates and only later were filled in with glass doors and the interior arches with mirrored doors. Since the loggia divided the building into two-halves, there are two symmetrical staircases on either side of it, rather than a single staircase. The rooms in the eastern half of the house were intended for the use of the king, those in the western were for Fouquet. The provision of a suite of rooms for the king was normal practice in aristocratic houses of the time, since the king travelled frequently.

Another surprising feature of the plan is the thickness of the main body of the building (&quot;corps de logis&quot;), which consists of two rows of rooms running east and west. Traditionally, the middle of the &quot;corps de logis&quot; of French châteaux consisted of a single row of rooms. Double-thick &quot;corps de logis&quot; had already been used in &quot;hôtels particuliers&quot; in Paris, including Le Vau&#x27;s Hôtel Tambonneau, but Vaux was the first château to incorporate this change. Even more unusual, the main rooms are all on the ground floor rather than the first floor (the traditional &quot;piano nobile&quot;). This accounts for the lack of a grand staircase or a gallery, standard elements of most contemporary châteaux. Also noteworthy are corridors in the basement and on the first floor, which run the length of house, providing privacy to the rooms they access. Up to the middle of the 17th century, corridors were essentially unknown. Another feature of the plan, the four pavilions, one at each corner of the building, is more conventional.

Vaux-le-Vicomte was originally planned to be constructed in brick and stone, but after the mid-century, as the middle classes began to imitate this style, aristocratic circles began using stone exclusively. Rather late in the design process, Fouquet and Le Vau switched to stone, a decision that may have been influenced by the use of stone at François Mansart&#x27;s Château de Maisons. The service buildings flanking the large &quot;avant-cour&quot; to the north of the house remained in brick and stone, and other structures preceding them were in rubble-stone and plaster, a social ranking of building materials that would be common in France for a considerable length of time thereafter.

The main château is constructed entirely on a moated platform, reached via two bridges, both aligned with the central axis and placed on the north and south sides. The moat is a picturesque holdover from medieval fortified residences, and is again a feature that Le Vau may have borrowed from Maisons. The moat at Vaux may also have been inspired by the previous château on the site, which Le Vau&#x27;s work replaced.

The bridge over the moat on the north side leads from the &quot;avant-cour&quot; to an ample forecourt, flanked by raised terraces on either side, a layout evoking the &quot;cour d&#x27;honneur&quot; of older aristocratic houses in which the entrance court was enclosed by anterior wings, typically housing kitchens and domestic quarters. Le Vau&#x27;s terraces even terminate in larger squares suggesting former pavilions. In more modern residences, like Vaux, it had become the custom to put these facilities in the basement, so these structures were no longer needed. This U-shaped plan of the house with the terraces is a device that again recalls Maisons, where Mansart intended &quot;to indicate that his château was conceived in a noble tradition of French design while at the same time emphasizing its modernity in comparison to predecessors.&quot;

The entrance front of the main château is characteristically French, with the two lateral pavilions flanking a central &quot;avant-corps&quot;, again reminiscent of Mansart&#x27;s work at Maisons. Le Vau supplements these with two additional receding volumes between the pavilions and the central mass. All of these elements are further emphasized with steep pyramidal caps. Such steep roofs were inherited from medieval times and, like brick, were rapidly going out of fashion. Le Vau would never use them again. The overall effect at Vaux, according to Andrew Ayers, is &quot;somewhat disparate and disorderly&quot;. Moreover, as David Hanser points out, Le Vau&#x27;s elevation violates several rules of pure classical architecture. One of the most egregious is the use of two, rather than three, bays in the lateral pavilions, resulting in the uncomfortable placement of the pediments directly over the central pilaster. Ayers does concede however that, &quot;although rather ungainly, the entrance facade at Vaux is nonetheless picturesque, in spite, or perhaps because, of its idiosyncrasies.&quot;

The garden front of the main château is considered more successful. The enormous, double-height Grand Salon that substantially protrudes from the &quot;corps de logis&quot; clearly dominates the southern elevation. The salon is covered by a huge slate dome surmounted with an imposing lantern and is fronted with a two-storey portico that is almost identical to one at the Hôtel Tambonneau. The use of a central oval salon is an innovation adopted by Le Vau from Italy. Although he himself had never been there, he undoubtedly knew from drawings and engravings of examples in buildings, such as the Palazzo Barberini in Rome, and had already used one to great effect at his Château du Raincy. At Le Raincy the salon spans the &quot;corps de logis&quot; and projects on both sides, but at Vaux, because of the double row of rooms, it is preceded by the vestibule on the entrance side, &quot;thus delaying and dramatizing the visitor&#x27;s discovery of this, the centrepiece of the house.&quot; The lateral pavilions of the garden facade project only slightly but are three bays wide with traditional tall slate roofs like those on the entrance front, effectively balancing the central domed salon.

=== Gardens ===
The château rises on an elevated platform in the middle of the woods and marks the border between unequal spaces, each treated in a different way. This effect is more distinctive today, as the woodlands are more mature, than it was in the seventeenth century when the site had been farmland, and the plantations were new.

Le Nôtre&#x27;s garden was the dominant structure of the great complex, stretching nearly a mile and a half (3 km), with a balanced composition of water basins and canals contained in stone curbs, fountains, gravel walks, and patterned parterres that remains more coherent than the vast display Le Nôtre was to create at Versailles.

The site was naturally well-watered, with two small rivers that met in the park; the canalized bed of one forms the Grand Canal, which leads to a square basin.

Le Nôtre created a magnificent scene to be viewed from the house, using the laws of perspective. Le Nôtre used the natural terrain to his advantage. He placed the canal at the lowest part of the complex, thus hiding it from the main perspectival point of view. Past the canal, the garden ascends a large open lawn and ends with the Hercules column added in the 19th century. Shrubberies provided a picture frame to the garden that also served as a stage for royal fêtes.

===Anamorphosis abscondita in the garden===
Le Nôtre employed an optical illusion called &quot;anamorphosis abscondita&quot; (which might be roughly translated as &#x27;hidden distortion&#x27;) in his garden design in order to establish decelerated perspective. The most apparent change in this manner is of the reflecting pools. They are narrower at the closest point to the viewer (standing at the rear of the château) than at their farthest point; this makes them appear closer to the viewer. From a certain designed viewing point, the distortion designed into the landscape elements produces a particular forced perspective and the eye perceives the elements to be closer than they actually are. That point, for Vaux-le-Vicomte, is at the top of the stairs at the rear of the château. Standing atop the grand staircase, one begins to experience the garden with a magnificent perspectival view. The anamorphosis abscondita creates visual effects, which are not encountered in nature, making the spectacle of gardens designed in this way extremely unusual to the viewer (who experiences a tension between the natural perspective cues in his peripheral vision and the forced perspective of the formal garden). The perspective effects are not readily apparent in photographs, either, making viewing the gardens in person the only way of truly experiencing them.

From the top of the grand staircase, this gives the impression that the entire garden is revealed in one single glance. Initially, the view consists of symmetrical rows of shrubbery, avenues, fountains, statues, flowers and other pieces developed to imitate nature: the elements exemplify the Baroque desire to mold nature to fit its wishes, thus using nature to imitate nature. The centrepiece is a large reflecting pool flanked by grottos holding statues in their many niches. The grand sloping lawn is not visible until one begins to explore the garden, when the viewer is made aware of the optical elements involved and discovers that the garden is much larger than it looks. Next, a circular pool, previously seen as ovular due to foreshortening, is passed and a canal that bisects the site is revealed, as well as a lower level path. As the viewer continues on, the second pool shows itself to be square and the grottos and their niched statues become clearer. However, when one walks towards the grottos, the relationship between the pool and the grottos appears awry. The grottos are actually on a much lower level than the rest of the garden and separated by a wide canal that is over half a mile (almost a kilometre) long. According to Allen Weiss, in &quot;Mirrors of Infinity&quot;, this optical effect is a result of the use of the tenth theorem of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Optics&quot;, which asserts that &quot;the most distant parts of planes situated below the eye appear to be the most elevated&quot;.

In Fouquet&#x27;s time, interested parties could cross the canal in a boat, but walking around the canal provides a view of the woods that mark what is no longer the garden and shows the distortion of the grottos previously seen as sculptural. Once the canal and grottos have been passed, the large sloping lawn is reached and the garden is viewed from the initial viewpoint&#x27;s vanishing point, thus completing the circuit as intended by Le Nôtre. From this point, the distortions create the illusion that the gardens are much longer than they actually are. The many discoveries made as one travels through the dynamic garden contrast with the static view of the garden from the château.

==Use in film, television and popular culture==
The château buildings and grounds have been used in at least 13 productions, a full 70, in fact, according to the owners. For example, the property was used as the California home of the main villain Hugo Drax (played by Michael Lonsdale) in the 1979 James Bond film &quot;Moonraker&quot;. It can also be seen in the background in the 1998 film &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot;. In addition, the château appeared in several episodes of &quot;The Revolution&quot;, which is a documentary television series about the American Revolutionary War that was broadcast by History Channel in 2006. &quot;Australia&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; had a fashion shoot at the château for its 7th Cycle (Episode 02), televised in August 2011. A confused retelling of the Vaux-le-Vicomte story was given by character Little Carmine Lupertazzi in season 4 of HBOs &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. More recently, it featured as the Palace of Versailles for BBC/Canal+ production of the TV drama series &quot;Versailles&quot;.

The château is one of the settings of Alexandre Dumas&#x27; novel &quot;The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later&quot;.

The second most expensive wedding was held at the palace in 2004. Vanisha Mittal, daughter of British-Indian steel industrialist billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, held her wedding to Amit Bhatia, a British-Indian economist and businessman, at the château following their engagement ceremony at the Palace of Versailles. Kylie Minogue was paid $330,000 to sing at the wedding and the ceremony was followed by fireworks launched from the Eiffel Tower. According to a report in &quot;India Today&quot;,&quot;over 35 craftsmen were flown in from Mumbai to erect a mandap on a pond in the sprawling gardens of the estate. Elephants made of fiberglass, minarets and a huge reception hall done up in pink were also put up. A lotus was designed in the pond and petals of all colour and shape scattered over it. Craftsmen were jetted in from India and florists from the Netherlands&quot;.

The Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte is the setting of Victoria&#x27;s Secret first short film, &quot;Victoria’s Secret Holiday 2016: A Very Private Affair.&quot;, featuring Stella Maxwell, Elsa Hosk, Taylor Hill, Romee Strijd, Sara Sampaio, Josephine Skriver and Jasmine Tookes.

<text>The fall of Constantinople, also known as the conquest of Constantinople, was the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire by the Ottoman Empire. The city was captured on 29 May 1453 as part of the culmination of a 55-day siege which had begun on 6 April. 

The attacking Ottoman Army, which significantly outnumbered Constantinople&#x27;s defenders, was commanded by the 21-year-old Sultan Mehmed II (later nicknamed &quot;the Conqueror&quot;), while the Byzantine army was led by Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. After conquering the city, Mehmed II made Constantinople the new Ottoman capital, replacing Adrianople.

The fall of Constantinople and of the Byzantine Empire was a watershed of the Late Middle Ages, marking the effective end of the Roman Empire, a state which began in roughly 27 BC and had lasted nearly 1500 years. For many modern historians, the fall of Constantinople marks the end of the medieval period and the beginning of the early modern period. The city&#x27;s fall also stood as a turning point in military history. Since ancient times, cities and castles had depended upon ramparts and walls to repel invaders. The Walls of Constantinople, especially the Theodosian Walls, protected Constantinople from attack for 800 years and were noted as some of the most advanced defensive systems in the world at the time. However, these fortifications were overcome with the use of gunpowder, specifically from Ottoman cannons and bombards, heralding a change in siege warfare. The Ottoman cannons repeatedly fired massive cannonballs weighing over which created gaps in the Theodosian Walls for the Ottoman siege.

==Background==
Constantinople had been an imperial capital since its consecration in 330 under Roman emperor Constantine the Great. In the following eleven centuries, the city had been besieged many times but was captured only once before: the Sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. The crusaders established an unstable Latin state in and around Constantinople while the remainder of the Byzantine Empire splintered into a number of successor states, notably Nicaea, Epirus and Trebizond. They fought as allies against the Latin establishments, but also fought among themselves for the Byzantine throne.

The Nicaeans eventually reconquered Constantinople from the Latins in 1261, reestablishing the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty. Thereafter, there was little peace for the much-weakened empire as it fended off successive attacks by the Latins, Serbs, Bulgarians and Ottoman Turks.

Between 1346 and 1349, the Black Death killed almost half of the inhabitants of Constantinople. The city was further depopulated by the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453, it consisted of a series of walled villages separated by vast fields encircled by the fifth-century Theodosian Walls.

By 1450, the empire was exhausted and had shrunk to a few square kilometers outside the city of Constantinople itself, the Princes&#x27; Islands in the Sea of Marmara and the Peloponnese with its cultural center at Mystras. The Empire of Trebizond, an independent successor state that formed in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, was also present at the time on the coast of the Black Sea.

==Preparations==
When Mehmed II succeeded his father in 1451, he was 19 years old. Many European courts assumed that the young Ottoman ruler would not seriously challenge Christian hegemony in the Balkans and the Aegean. In fact, Europe celebrated Mehmed coming to the throne and hoped his inexperience would lead the Ottomans astray. This calculation was boosted by Mehmed&#x27;s friendly overtures to the European envoys at his new court. But Mehmed&#x27;s mild words were not matched by his actions. By early 1452, work began on the construction of a second fortress (&quot;Rumeli hisarı&quot;) on the European side of the Bosphorus, several miles north of Constantinople. The new fortress sat directly across the strait from the &quot;Anadolu Hisarı&quot; fortress, built by Mehmed&#x27;s great-grandfather Bayezid I. This pair of fortresses ensured complete control of sea traffic on the Bosphorus and defended against attack by the Genoese colonies on the Black Sea coast to the north. In fact, the new fortress was called &quot;Boğazkesen&quot;, which means &quot;strait-blocker&quot; or &quot;throat-cutter&quot;. The wordplay emphasizes its strategic position: in Turkish &quot;boğaz&quot; means both &quot;strait&quot; and &quot;throat&quot;. In October 1452, Mehmed ordered Turakhan Beg to station a large garrison force in the Peloponnese to block Thomas and Demetrios (despotes in Southern Greece) from providing aid to their brother Constantine XI Palaiologos during the impending siege of Constantinople. Karaca Pasha, the beylerbeyi of Rumelia, sent men to prepare the roads from Adrianople to Constantinople so that bridges could cope with the massive cannons. Fifty carpenters and 200 artisans also strengthened the roads where necessary. The Greek historian Michael Critobulus quotes Mehmed II&#x27;s speech to his soldiers before the siege:

===European support===
Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI swiftly understood Mehmed&#x27;s true intentions and turned to Western Europe for help; but now the price of centuries of war and enmity between the eastern and western churches had to be paid. Since the mutual excommunications of 1054, the Pope in Rome was committed to establishing authority over the eastern church. The union was agreed by the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1274, at the Second Council of Lyon, and indeed, some Palaiologoi emperors had since been received into the Latin Church. Emperor John VIII Palaiologos had also recently negotiated union with Pope Eugene IV, with the Council of Florence of 1439 proclaiming a &quot;Bull of Union&quot;. The imperial efforts to impose union were met with strong resistance in Constantinople. A propaganda initiative was stimulated by anti-unionist Orthodox partisans in Constantinople; the population, as well as the laity and leadership of the Byzantine Church, became bitterly divided. Latent ethnic hatred between Greeks and Italians, stemming from the events of the Massacre of the Latins in 1182 by the Greeks and the Sack of Constantinople in 1204 by the Latins, played a significant role. Ultimately, the attempted union between east and west failed, greatly annoying Pope Nicholas V and the hierarchy of the Roman church.

In the summer of 1452, when Rumeli Hisarı was completed and the threat of the Ottomans had become imminent, Constantine wrote to the Pope, promising to implement the union, which was declared valid by a half-hearted imperial court on 12 December 1452. Although he was eager for an advantage, Pope Nicholas V did not have the influence the Byzantines thought he had over the Western kings and princes, some of whom were wary of increasing papal control. Furthermore, these Western rulers did not have the wherewithal to contribute to the effort, especially in light of the weakened state of France and England from the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Spain&#x27;s involvement in the Reconquista, the internecine fighting in the Holy Roman Empire, and Hungary and Poland&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Varna of 1444. Although some troops did arrive from the mercantile city-states in northern Italy, the Western contribution was not adequate to counterbalance Ottoman strength. Some Western individuals, however, came to help defend the city on their own account. Cardinal Isidore, funded by the Pope, arrived in 1452 with 200 archers. An accomplished soldier from Genoa, Giovanni Giustiniani, arrived in January 1453 with 400 men from Genoa and 300 men from Genoese Chios. As a specialist in defending walled cities, Giustiniani was immediately given the overall command of the defence of the land walls by the Emperor. The Byzantines knew him by the Latin spelling of his name, &quot;John Justinian&quot;, named after the famous 6th century Byzantine emperor Justinian the Great. Around the same time, the captains of the Venetian ships that happened to be present in the Golden Horn offered their services to the Emperor, barring contrary orders from Venice, and Pope Nicholas undertook to send three ships laden with provisions, which set sail near the end of March.
From the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily arrived in Constantinople the condottiero Gabriele Orsini del Balzo, duke of Venosa and count of Ugento, together with 200 Neapolitan archers, who died fighting for the defense of the capital of the Byzantine Empire.

Meanwhile, in Venice, deliberations were taking place concerning the kind of assistance the Republic would lend to Constantinople. The Senate decided upon sending a fleet in February 1453, but the fleet&#x27;s departure was delayed until April, when it was already too late for ships to assist in battle. Further undermining Byzantine morale, seven Italian ships with around 700 men, despite having sworn to defend Constantinople, slipped out of the capital the moment Giustiniani arrived. At the same time, Constantine&#x27;s attempts to appease the Sultan with gifts ended with the execution of the Emperor&#x27;s ambassadors.


=== The Great Chain of the Golden Horn ===
Fearing a possible naval attack along the shores of the Golden Horn, Emperor Constantine XI ordered that a defensive chain be placed at the mouth of the harbour. This chain, which floated on logs, was strong enough to prevent any Turkish ship from entering the harbour. This device was one of two that gave the Byzantines some hope of extending the siege until the possible arrival of foreign help. This strategy was used because in 1204, the armies of the Fourth Crusade successfully circumvented Constantinople&#x27;s land defences by breaching the Golden Horn Wall, which faces the Horn. Another strategy employed by the Byzantines was the repair and fortification of the Land Wall (Theodosian Walls). Emperor Constantine deemed it necessary to ensure that the Blachernae district&#x27;s wall was the most fortified because that section of the wall protruded northwards. The land fortifications consisted of a wide moat fronting inner and outer crenellated walls studded with towers every 45–55 metres.

===Strength===
The army defending Constantinople was relatively small, totalling about 7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were foreigners. The population decline also had a huge impact upon the Constantinople&#x27;s defense capabilities. At the end of March 1453, emperor Constantine XI ordered a census of districts to record how many able-bodied men were in the city and whatever weapons each possessed for defense. George Sphrantzes, the faithful chancellor of the last emperor, recorded that &quot;in spite of the great size of our city, our defenders amounted to 4,773 Greeks, as well as just 200 foreigners&quot;. In addition there were volunteers from outside, the &quot;Genoese, Venetians and those who came secretly from Galata to help the defense&quot;, who numbered &quot;hardly as many as three thousand&quot;, amounting to something under 8,000 men in total to defend a perimeter wall of twelve miles. At the onset of the siege, probably fewer than 50,000 people were living within the walls, including the refugees from the surrounding area. Turkish commander Dorgano, who was in Constantinople working for the Emperor, was also guarding one of the quarters of the city on the seaward side with the Turks in his pay. These Turks kept loyal to the Emperor and perished in the ensuing battle. The defending army&#x27;s Genoese corps were well trained and equipped, while the rest of the army consisted of small numbers of well-trained soldiers, armed civilians, sailors and volunteer forces from foreign communities, and finally monks. The garrison used a few small-calibre artillery pieces, which in the end proved ineffective. The rest of the citizens repaired walls, stood guard on observation posts, collected and distributed food provisions, and collected gold and silver objects from churches to melt down into coins to pay the foreign soldiers.

The Ottomans had a much larger force. Recent studies and Ottoman archival data state that there were some 50,000–80,000 Ottoman soldiers, including between 5,000 and 10,000 Janissaries, 70 cannons, and an elite infantry corps, and thousands of Christian troops, notably 1,500 Serbian cavalry that Đurađ Branković was forced to supply as part of his obligation to the Ottoman sultan — just a few months before, Branković had supplied the money for the reconstruction of the walls of Constantinople. Contemporaneous Western witnesses of the siege, who tend to exaggerate the military power of the Sultan, provide disparate and higher numbers ranging from 160,000 to 300,000 (Niccolò Barbaro: 160,000; the Florentine merchant Jacopo Tedaldi and the Great Logothete George Sphrantzes: 200,000; the Cardinal Isidore of Kiev and the Archbishop of Mytilene Leonardo di Chio: 300,000).

====Ottoman dispositions and strategies====
Mehmed built a fleet (crewed partially by Spanish sailors from Gallipoli) to besiege the city from the sea. Contemporary estimates of the strength of the Ottoman fleet span from 110 ships to 430 (Tedaldi: 110; Barbaro: 145; Ubertino Pusculo: 160, Isidore of Kiev and Leonardo di Chio: 200–250; (Sphrantzes): 430). A more realistic modern estimate predicts a fleet strength of 110 ships comprising 70 large galleys, 5 ordinary galleys, 10 smaller galleys, 25 large rowing boats, and 75 horse-transports.

Before the siege of Constantinople, it was known that the Ottomans had the ability to cast medium-sized cannons, but the range of some pieces they were able to field far surpassed the defenders&#x27; expectations. The Ottomans deployed a number of cannons, anywhere from 12 to 62 cannons. They were built at foundries that employed Turkish cannon founders and technicians, most notably Saruca, in addition to at least one foreign cannon founder, Orban (also called Urban). Most of the cannons at the siege were built by Turkish engineers, including a large bombard by Saruca, while one cannon was built by Orban, who also contributed a large bombard.

Orban, a Hungarian (though some suggest he was German), was a somewhat mysterious figure. His cannon was named &quot;Basilica&quot; and was able to hurl a stone ball over a mile (1.6 km). Orban initially tried to sell his services to the Byzantines, but they were unable to secure the funds needed to hire him. Orban then left Constantinople and approached Mehmed II, claiming that his weapon could blast &quot;the walls of Babylon itself&quot;. Given abundant funds and materials, the Hungarian engineer built the gun within three months at Edirne. However, this was the only cannon that Orban built for the Ottoman forces at Constantinople, and it had several drawbacks: it took three hours to reload; cannonballs were in very short supply; and the cannon is said to have collapsed under its own recoil after six weeks. The account of the cannon&#x27;s collapse is disputed, given that it was only reported in the letter of Archbishop Leonardo di Chio and in the later, and often unreliable, Russian chronicle of Nestor Iskander.
Having previously established a large foundry about away, Mehmed now had to undertake the painstaking process of transporting his massive artillery pieces. In preparation for the final assault, Mehmed had an artillery train of 70 large pieces dragged from his headquarters at Edirne, in addition to the bombards cast on the spot. This train included Orban&#x27;s enormous cannon, which was said to have been dragged from Edirne by a crew of 60 oxen and over 400 men. There was another large bombard, independently built by Turkish engineer Saruca, that was also used in the battle.

Mehmed planned to attack the Theodosian Walls, the intricate series of walls and ditches protecting Constantinople from an attack from the West and the only part of the city not surrounded by water. His army encamped outside the city on 2 April 1453, the Monday after Easter.

The bulk of the Ottoman army was encamped south of the Golden Horn. The regular European troops, stretched out along the entire length of the walls, were commanded by Karadja Pasha. The regular troops from Anatolia under Ishak Pasha were stationed south of the Lycus down to the Sea of Marmara. Mehmed himself erected his red-and-gold tent near the &quot;Mesoteichion&quot;, where the guns and the elite Janissary regiments were positioned. The Bashi-bazouks were spread out behind the front lines. Other troops under Zagan Pasha were employed north of the Golden Horn. Communication was maintained by a road that had been destroyed over the marshy head of the Horn.

The Ottomans were experts in laying siege to cities. They knew that in order to prevent diseases they had to burn corpses, sanitarily dispose of excrement, and carefully scrutinize their sources of water.

====Byzantine dispositions and tactics====
The city had about 20 km of walls (land walls: 5.5 km; sea walls along the Golden Horn: 7 km; sea walls along the Sea of Marmara: 7.5 km), one of the strongest sets of fortified walls in existence. The walls had recently been repaired (under John VIII) and were in fairly good shape, giving the defenders sufficient reason to believe that they could hold out until help from the West arrived. In addition, the defenders were relatively well-equipped with a fleet of 26 ships: 5 from Genoa, 5 from Venice, 3 from Venetian Crete, 1 from Ancona, 1 from Aragon, 1 from France, and about 10 from the empire itself.

On 5 April, the Sultan himself arrived with his last troops, and the defenders took up their positions. As Byzantine numbers were insufficient to occupy the walls in their entirety, it had been decided that only the outer walls would be guarded. Constantine and his Greek troops guarded the &quot;Mesoteichion&quot;, the middle section of the land walls, where they were crossed by the river Lycus. This section was considered the weakest spot in the walls and an attack was feared here most. Giustiniani was stationed to the north of the emperor, at the Charisian Gate (&quot;Myriandrion&quot;); later during the siege, he was shifted to the &quot;Mesoteichion&quot; to join Constantine, leaving the &quot;Myriandrion&quot; to the charge of the Bocchiardi brothers. and his Venetians were stationed in the Blachernae Palace, together with Teodoro Caristo, the Langasco brothers, and Archbishop Leonardo of Chios.

To the left of the emperor, further south, were the commanders Cataneo, who led Genoese troops, and Theophilus Palaeologus, who guarded the Pegae Gate with Greek soldiers. The section of the land walls from the Pegae Gate to the Golden Gate (itself guarded by a Genoese called Manuel) was defended by the Venetian Filippo Contarini, while Demetrius Cantacuzenus had taken position on the southernmost part of the Theodosian wall. The sea walls were guarded more sparsely, with Jacobo Contarini at Stoudion, a makeshift defence force of Greek monks to his left hand, and Prince Orhan at the Harbour of Eleutherios. Genoese and Catalan troops were stationed at the Great Palace; Cardinal Isidore of Kiev guarded the tip of the peninsula near the boom. Finally, the sea walls at the southern shore of the Golden Horn were defended by Venetian and Genoese sailors under Gabriele Trevisano.

Two tactical reserves were kept behind in the city: one in the Petra district just behind the land walls and one near the Church of the Holy Apostles, under the command of Loukas Notaras and Nicephorus Palaeologus, respectively. The Venetian Alviso Diedo commanded the ships in the harbour. Although the Byzantines also had cannons, the weapons were much smaller than those of the Ottomans, and the recoil tended to damage their own walls. According to David Nicolle, despite many odds, the idea that Constantinople was inevitably doomed is incorrect and the situation was not as one-sided as a simple glance at a map might suggest. It has also been claimed that Constantinople was &quot;the best-defended city in Europe&quot; at that time.

==Siege==
At the beginning of the siege, Mehmed sent out some of his best troops to reduce the remaining Byzantine strongholds outside the city of Constantinople. The fortress of Therapia on the Bosphorus and a smaller castle at the village of Studius near the Sea of Marmara were taken within a few days. The Princes&#x27; Islands in the Sea of Marmara were likely taken by Admiral Baltoghlu&#x27;s fleet during this phase of the siege. Mehmed&#x27;s massive cannons fired on the walls for weeks but due to their imprecision and extremely slow rate of fire, the Byzantines were able to repair most of the damage after each shot, mitigating the effect of the Ottoman artillery.

Despite some probing attacks, the Ottoman fleet under Baltoghlu could not enter the Golden Horn due to the chain across the entrance. Although one of the fleet&#x27;s main tasks was to prevent any foreign ships from entering the Golden Horn, on 20 April, a small flotilla of four Christian ships managed to get in after some heavy fighting, an event which strengthened the morale of the defenders and caused embarrassment to the Sultan. Baltoghlu was most likely injured in the eye during the skirmish. Mehmed stripped Baltoghlu of his wealth and property and gave it to the janissaries and ordered him to be whipped 100 times.

Mehmed ordered the construction of a road of greased logs across Galata on the north side of the Golden Horn and dragged his ships over the hill, directly into the Golden Horn on 22 April, bypassing the chain barrier. This action seriously threatened the flow of supplies from Genoese ships from the nominally neutral colony of Pera and it demoralized the Byzantine defenders. On the night of 28 April, an attempt was made to destroy the Ottoman ships already in the Golden Horn using fire ships but the Ottomans forced the Christians to retreat with many casualties. Forty Italians escaped their sinking ships and swam to the northern shore. On orders of Mehmed, they were impaled on stakes, in sight of the city&#x27;s defenders on the sea walls across the Golden Horn. In retaliation, the defenders brought their Ottoman prisoners, 260 in all, to the walls, where they were executed, one by one, before the eyes of the Ottomans. With the failure of their attack on the Ottoman vessels, the defenders were forced to disperse part of their forces to defend the sea walls along the Golden Horn.

The Ottoman army had made several frontal assaults on the land wall of Constantinople, but they were costly failures. Venetian surgeon Niccolò Barbaro, describing in his diary one such land attack by the Janissaries, wrote


After these inconclusive attacks, the Ottomans sought to break through the walls by constructing tunnels to mine them from mid-May to 25 May. Many of the sappers were miners of Serbian origin sent from Novo Brdo under the command of Zagan Pasha. An engineer named Johannes Grant, a German who came with the Genoese contingent, had counter-mines dug, allowing Byzantine troops to enter the mines and kill the miners. The Byzantines intercepted the first tunnel on the night of 16 May. Subsequent tunnels were interrupted on 21, 23 and 25 May, and destroyed with Greek fire and vigorous combat. On 23 May, the Byzantines captured and tortured two Turkish officers, who revealed the location of all the Turkish tunnels, which were destroyed.

On 21 May, Mehmed sent an ambassador to Constantinople and offered to lift the siege if they gave him the city. He promised he would allow the Emperor and any other inhabitants to leave with their possessions. He would recognize the Emperor as governor of the Peloponnese. Lastly, he guaranteed the safety of the population that might choose to remain in the city. Constantine XI only agreed to pay higher tributes to the sultan and recognized the status of all the conquered castles and lands in the hands of the Turks as Ottoman possessions. The Emperor was not willing to leave the city without a fight:

Around this time, Mehmed had a final council with his senior officers. Here he encountered some resistance; one of his Viziers, the veteran Halil Pasha, who had always disapproved of Mehmed&#x27;s plans to conquer the city, now admonished him to abandon the siege in the face of recent adversity. Zagan Pasha argued against Halil Pasha and insisted on an immediate attack. Believing that the Byzantine defence was already weakened sufficiently, Mehmed planned to overpower the walls by sheer force and started preparations for a final all-out offensive.

===Final assault===
Preparations for the final assault began in the evening of 26 May and continued to the next day. For 36 hours after the war council decided to attack, the Ottomans extensively mobilized their manpower for the general offensive. Prayer and resting was then granted to the soldiers on 28 May before the final assault would be launched. On the Byzantine side, a small Venetian fleet of 12 ships, after having searched the Aegean, reached the Capital on 27 May and reported to the Emperor that no large Venetian relief fleet was on its way. On 28 May, as the Ottoman army prepared for the final assault, mass religious processions were held in the city. In the evening, a solemn last ceremony of Vespers was held in the Hagia Sophia, in which the Emperor with representatives and nobility of both the Latin and Greek churches partook. Up until this point, the Ottomans had fired 5,000 shots from their cannons using 55,000 pounds of gunpowder. Criers roamed the camp to the sound of the blasting horns, rousing the Ghazis.

Shortly after midnight on Tuesday 29 May, the offensive began. The Christian troops of the Ottoman Empire attacked first, followed by successive waves of the irregular azaps, who were poorly trained and equipped and Anatolian Turkmen beylik forces who focused on a section of the damaged Blachernae walls in the north-west part of the city. This section of the walls had been built earlier, in the 11th century, and was much weaker. The Turkmen mercenaries managed to breach this section of walls and entered the city but they were just as quickly pushed back by the defenders. Finally, the last wave consisting of elite Janissaries, attacked the city walls. The Genoese general in charge of the defenders on land, Giovanni Giustiniani, was grievously wounded during the attack, and his evacuation from the ramparts caused a panic in the ranks of the defenders.

With Giustiniani&#x27;s Genoese troops retreating into the city and towards the harbour, Constantine and his men, now left to their own devices, continued to hold their ground against the Janissaries. Constantine&#x27;s men eventually could not prevent the Ottomans from entering the city and the defenders were overwhelmed at several points along the wall. Janissaries, led by Ulubatlı Hasan, pressed forward. Many Greek soldiers ran back home to protect their families, the Venetians retreated to their ships and a few of the Genoese escaped to Galata. The rest surrendered or committed suicide by jumping off the city walls. The Greek houses nearest to the walls were the first to suffer from the Ottomans. It is said that Constantine, throwing aside his purple imperial regalia, led the final charge against the incoming Ottomans, perishing in the ensuing battle in the streets alongside his soldiers. The Venetian Nicolò Barbaro claimed in his diary that Constantine hanged himself at the moment when the Turks broke in at the San Romano gate. Ultimately, his fate remains unknown.

After the initial assault, the Ottoman army fanned out along the main thoroughfare of the city, the Mese, past the great forums and the Church of the Holy Apostles, which Mehmed II wanted to provide as a seat for his newly appointed patriarch to better control his Christian subjects. Mehmed II had sent an advance guard to protect these key buildings. The Catalans that maintained their position on the section of the wall that the emperor had assigned them, had the honor of being the last troops to fall. The sultan had Pere Julià, his sons and the consul Joan de la Via, amongst others, beheaded.

A few civilians managed to escape. When the Venetians retreated over to their ships, the Ottomans had already taken the walls of the Golden Horn. Luckily for the occupants of the city, the Ottomans were not interested in killing potentially valuable slaves but rather in the loot they could get from raiding the city&#x27;s houses, so they decided to attack the city instead. The Venetian captain ordered his men to break open the gate of the Golden Horn. Having done so, the Venetians left in ships filled with soldiers and refugees. Shortly after the Venetians left, a few Genoese ships and even the Emperor&#x27;s ships followed them out of the Golden Horn. This fleet narrowly escaped prior to the Ottoman navy assuming control over the Golden Horn, which was accomplished by midday.

The army converged upon the Augusteum, the vast square that fronted the great church of Hagia Sophia whose bronze gates were barred by a huge throng of civilians inside the building, hoping for divine protection. After the doors were breached, the troops separated the congregation according to what price they might bring in the slave markets. Ottoman casualties are unknown but they are believed by most historians to be severe due to several unsuccessful Ottoman attacks made during the siege and final assault. The Venetian Barbaro observed that blood flowed in the city &quot;like rainwater in the gutters after a sudden storm&quot; and that bodies of Turks and Christians floated in the sea &quot;like melons along a canal&quot;.

== Atrocities ==

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, Mehmed II &quot;permitted an initial period of looting that saw the destruction of many Orthodox churches&quot;, but tried to prevent a complete sack of the city. 
The looting was extremely thorough in certain parts of the city. On 2 June, the Sultan found the city largely deserted and half in ruins; churches had been desecrated and stripped, houses were no longer habitable, and stores and shops were emptied. He is famously reported to have been moved to tears by this, saying, &quot;What a city we have given over to plunder and destruction.&quot;

According to David Nicolle, the ordinary people were treated better by their Ottoman conquerors than their ancestors had been by Crusaders back in 1204, stating that only about 4,000 Greeks died in the siege, while according to a Venetian Senate report, 50 Venetian noblemen and over 500 other Venetian civilians died during the siege. 
Many of the riches of the city were already looted in 1204, leaving only limited loot to the Ottomans.
Other sources claim far more brutal and successful pillaging by the Ottoman invaders. 

Looting was carried out on a massive scale by sailors and marines who entered the city via other walls before they had been suppressed by regular troops, who were beyond the main gate. 
&quot;Everywhere there was misfortune, everyone was touched by pain&quot; when Mehmed entered the city. &quot;There were lamentations and weeping in every house, screaming in the crossroads, and sorrow in all churches; the groaning of grown men and the shrieking of women accompanied looting, enslavement, separation, and rape.&quot; 

If any citizens of Constantinople tried to resist, they were slaughtered. According to Niccolò Barbaro, &quot;all through the day the Turks made a great slaughter of Christians through the city&quot;. According to Makarios Melissenos:

The women of Constantinople suffered from rape at the hands of Ottoman forces. 
According to historian Philip Mansel, widespread persecution of the city&#x27;s civilian inhabitants took place, resulting in thousands of murders and rapes. 

Leonard of Chios made accounts of the atrocities that followed the fall of Constantinople stated the Ottoman invaders pillaged the city, murdered or enslaved tens of thousands of people, and raped nuns, women and children:

According to Steven Runciman most of the elderly and the infirm/wounded and sick who were refugees inside the churches were killed, and the remainder were chained up and sold into slavery.

During three days of pillaging, the Ottoman invaders captured children and took them away to their tents, and became rich by plundering the imperial palace and the houses of Constantinople. 
The Ottoman official Tursun Beg wrote:

Critobulus also noted: &quot;As for the Sultan, he was sensual rather than acquisitive, and more interested in people than in goods. Phrantzes, the faithful servant of the Basileus, has recounted the fate of his young and good-looking family. His three daughters were consigned to the Imperial harem, even the youngest, a girl of fourteen, who died there of despair. His only son John, a fifteen-year-old boy, was killed by the sultan for having repelled his advances.&quot;

George Sphrantzes says that people of both genders were raped inside Hagia Sophia. Critobulus described the enslavement and sexual abuse committed by the Ottoman troops inside the Hagia Sophia: 

The elder refugees in the Hagia Sophia were slaughtered and the women raped. 
Mehmed entered the Hagia Sophia, &quot;marveling at the sight&quot; of the grand basilica. Witnessing a Ghazi wildly hammering at the marble floor, he asked what he was doing. &quot;It is for the Faith!&quot; the Ghazi said. 
Mehmed cut him down with his Kilij: &quot;Be satisfied with the booty and the captives; the buildings of the city belong to me.&quot;

Ottoman Chroniclers confirmed: &quot;They made the people of the city slaves and killed their emperor, and the gazis embraced their pretty girls&quot;.

During the festivities, &quot;and as he had promised his viziers and his other officers,&quot; Mehmed had the &quot;wretched citizens of Constantinople&quot; dragged before them and &quot;ordered many of them to be hacked to pieces, for the sake of entertainment.&quot;

Byzantine historian Doukas claims that, while drunk during his victory banquet, the Sultan ordered the Grand Duke Loukas Notaras to give his youngest son, to him for his pleasure. He replied that &quot;it would be far better for me to die than hand over my own child to be despoiled by him.&quot; Mehmed was enraged after hearing this and ordered Loukas to be executed. Before his death, Notaras supposedly said that &quot;Him who was crucified for us, died and arose&quot;&#x27; and urged his horrified sons to reject the advances of Mehmed and not fear the outcome. Their father&#x27;s words encouraged them, and they also &quot;were ready to die&quot;. They are also said to have been executed. However, American researcher and professor Walter G. Andrew doubts the authenticity of this story, citing the similarities with the earlier story of Saint Pelagius, he states that, &quot;it is likely that Doukas&#x27;s tale owes more to Saint Pelagius and a long history of attempts to portray Muslims as morally inferior than to anything that actually happened during the conquest of Constantinople/Istanbul.&quot; One of the concubines (sex slaves) in the Ottoman Imperial harem of Sultan Mehmet II was Çiçek Hatun, who was herself referred to as a slave-girl captured during the fall of Constantinople. 

The vast majority of the citizens of Constantinople (30,000–50,000) were forced to become slaves.
According to Nicolas de Nicolay, slaves were displayed naked at the city&#x27;s slave market, and young girls could be purchased.

== Aftermath ==
Mehmed II granted his soldiers three days to plunder the city, as he had promised them and in accordance with the custom of the time. By noon, the city streets were filled with blood. The Turks looted houses, raped and impaled women and children, destroyed churches, tore icons from their frames and books from their bindings. All that remained of the imperial palace in Blachernae were the walls; Byzantium&#x27;s most sacred icon, the Hodegetria, was cut into four pieces and destroyed. The most monstrous events took place in the Church of Hagia Sophia. There, the morning service was already underway when the parishioners heard the maddened conquerors approaching. The huge bronze doors immediately slammed shut, but soon the Turks smashed them and entered the temple. The poorer and less attractive looking parishioners were killed on the spot, the rest were taken to a Turkish camp, where they remained to await the decision of their fate. Soldiers fought over the possession of some of the spoils of war. On the third day of the conquest, Mehmed II ordered all looting to stop and issued a proclamation that all Christians who had avoided capture or who had been ransomed could return to their homes without further molestation, although many had no homes to return to, and many more had been taken captive and not ransomed. Byzantine historian George Sphrantzes, an eyewitness to the fall of Constantinople, described the Sultan&#x27;s actions:

Mehmed himself knocked over and trampled on the altar of the Hagia Sophia. He then ordered a muezzin to ascend the pulpit and sound a prayer. The &quot;Hagia Sophia&quot; was converted into a mosque, but the Greek Orthodox Church was allowed to remain intact and Gennadius Scholarius was appointed Patriarch of Constantinople. This was once thought to be the origin of the Ottoman &quot;millet&quot; system; however, it is now considered a myth and no such system existed in the fifteenth century.
The fall of Constantinople shocked many Europeans, who viewed it as a catastrophic event for their civilization. Many feared other European Christian kingdoms would suffer the same fate as Constantinople. Two possible responses emerged amongst the humanists and churchmen of that era: Crusade or dialogue. Pope Pius II strongly advocated for another Crusade, while the German Nicholas of Cusa supported engaging in a dialogue with the Ottomans.

The Morean (Peloponnesian) fortress of Mystras, where Constantine&#x27;s brothers Thomas and Demetrius ruled, constantly in conflict with each other and knowing that Mehmed would eventually invade them as well, held out until 1460. Long before the fall of Constantinople, Demetrius had fought for the throne with Thomas, Constantine, and their other brothers John and Theodore. Thomas escaped to Rome when the Ottomans invaded Morea while Demetrius expected to rule a puppet state, but instead was imprisoned and remained there for the rest of his life. In Rome, Thomas and his family received some monetary support from the Pope and other Western rulers as Byzantine emperor in exile, until 1503. In 1461, the independent Byzantine state in Trebizond fell to Mehmed.

Constantine XI had died without producing an heir, and had Constantinople not fallen he likely would have been succeeded by the sons of his deceased elder brother, who were taken into the palace service of Mehmed after the fall of Constantinople. The oldest boy, renamed Murad, became a personal favourite of Mehmed and served as Beylerbey (Governor-General) of Rumeli (the Balkans). The younger son, renamed Mesih Pasha, became Admiral of the Ottoman fleet and Sancak Beg (Governor) of the province of Gallipoli. He eventually served twice as Grand Vizier under Mehmed&#x27;s son, Bayezid II.

With the capture of Constantinople, Mehmed II had acquired the future capital of his kingdom, albeit one in decline due to years of war. The loss of the city was a crippling blow to Christendom, and it exposed the Christian West to a vigorous and aggressive foe in the East. The Christian reconquest of Constantinople remained a goal in Western Europe for many years after its fall to the Ottoman Empire. Rumours of Constantine XI&#x27;s survival and subsequent rescue by an angel led many to hope that the city would one day return to Christian hands. Pope Nicholas V called for an immediate counter-attack in the form of a crusade, however no European powers wished to participate, and the Pope resorted to sending a small fleet of 10 ships to defend the city. The short lived Crusade immediately came to an end and as Western Europe entered the 16th century, the age of Crusading began to come to an end.

For some time Greek scholars had gone to Italian city-states, a cultural exchange begun in 1396 by Coluccio Salutati, chancellor of Florence, who had invited Manuel Chrysoloras, to lecture at the University of Florence. After the conquest many Greeks, such as John Argyropoulos and Constantine Lascaris, fled the city and found refuge in the Latin West, bringing with them knowledge and documents from the Greco-Roman tradition to Italy and other regions that further propelled the Renaissance. Those Greeks who stayed behind in Constantinople mostly lived in the Phanar and Galata districts of the city. The Phanariotes, as they were called, provided many capable advisers to the Ottoman rulers.

A severed head that was claimed to belong to Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos was found and presented to Mehmed and nailed onto a column. While standing before the head, the sultan in his speech said:
The news spread rapidly across the Islamic world. In Egypt &quot;good tidings were proclaimed, and Cairo decorated&quot; to celebrate &quot;this greatest of conquests.&quot; The Sharif of Mecca wrote to Mehmed, calling the Sultan &quot;the one who has aided Islam and the Muslims, the Sultan of all kings and sultans&quot;. The fact that Constantinople, which was long &quot;known for being indomitable in the eyes of all,&quot; as the Sharif of Mecca said, had fallen and that the Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s prophecy came true shocked the Islamic world and filled it with a great jubilation and rapture.

===Third Rome===

Byzantium is a term used by modern historians to refer to the later Roman Empire. In its own time, the Empire ruled from Constantinople (or &quot;New Rome&quot; as some people call it, although this was a laudatory expression that was never an official title) and was simply considered as &quot;the Roman Empire.&quot; The fall of Constantinople led competing factions to lay claim to being the inheritors of the Imperial mantle. Russian claims to Byzantine heritage clashed with those of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s own claim. In Mehmed&#x27;s view, he was the successor to the Roman Emperor, declaring himself &quot;Kayser-i Rum&quot;, literally &quot;Caesar of the Romans&quot;, that is, of the Roman Empire, though he was remembered as &quot;the Conqueror&quot;.

Stefan Dušan, Tsar of Serbia, and Ivan Alexander, Tsar of Bulgaria, both made similar claims, regarding themselves as legitimate heirs to the Roman Empire . Other potential claimants, such as the Republic of Venice and the Holy Roman Empire, have disintegrated into history.

===Impact on the Churches===
Pope Pius II believed that the Ottomans would persecute Greek Orthodox Christians and advocated for another crusade at the Council of Mantua in 1459.

===Legends===
There are many legends in Greece surrounding the Fall of Constantinople. It was said that the partial lunar eclipse that occurred on 22 May 1453 represented a fulfilment of a prophecy of the city&#x27;s demise.

Four days later, the whole city was blotted out by a thick fog, a condition unknown in that part of the world in May. When the fog lifted that evening, a strange light was seen playing about the dome of the Hagia Sophia, which some interpreted as the Holy Spirit departing from the city. &quot;This evidently indicated the departure of the Divine Presence, and its leaving the City in total abandonment and desertion, for the Divinity conceals itself in cloud and appears and again disappears.&quot;

For others, there was still a distant hope that the lights were the campfires of the troops of John Hunyadi who had come to relieve the city. It is possible that all these phenomena were local effects of the cataclysmic 1452/1453 mystery eruption which occurred around the time of the siege. The &quot;fire&quot; seen may have been an optical illusion due to the reflection of intensely red twilight glow by clouds of volcanic ash high in the atmosphere.

Another legend holds that two priests saying divine liturgy over the crowd disappeared into the cathedral&#x27;s walls as the first Turkish soldiers entered. According to the legend, the priests will appear again on the day that Constantinople returns to Christian hands. Another legend refers to the &quot;Marble Emperor&quot; (Constantine XI), holding that an angel rescued the emperor when the Ottomans entered the city, turning him into marble and placing him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to be brought to life again (a variant of the sleeping hero legend). However, many of the myths surrounding the disappearance of Constantine were developed later and little evidence can be found to support them even in friendly primary accounts of the siege.

===Cultural impact===
Guillaume Dufay composed several songs lamenting the fall of the Eastern church, and the duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good, avowed to take up arms against the Turks. However, as the growing Ottoman power from this date on coincided with the Protestant Reformation and subsequent Counter-Reformation, the recapture of Constantinople became an ever-distant dream. Even France, once a fervent participant in the Crusades, became an ally of the Ottomans.

Nonetheless, depictions of Christian coalitions taking the city and of the late Emperor&#x27;s resurrection by Leo the Wise persisted.

29 May 1453, the day of the fall of Constantinople, fell on a Tuesday, and since then Tuesday has been considered an unlucky day by Greeks generally.

===Impact on the Renaissance===

The migration waves of Byzantine scholars and émigrés in the period following the sacking of Constantinople and the fall of Constantinople in 1453 is considered by many scholars key to the revival of Greek and Roman studies that led to the development of the Renaissance humanism and science. These émigrés were grammarians, humanists, poets, writers, printers, lecturers, musicians, astronomers, architects, academics, artists, scribes, philosophers, scientists, politicians and theologians. They brought to Western Europe the far greater preserved and accumulated knowledge of Byzantine civilization. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;: &quot;Many modern scholars also agree that the exodus of Greeks to Italy as a result of this event marked the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Renaissance&quot;.

===Renaming of the city===

Ottomans used the Arabic transliteration of the city&#x27;s name &quot;Qosṭanṭīniyye&quot; (القسطنطينية) or &quot;Kostantiniyye&quot;, as can be seen in numerous Ottoman documents. &quot;Islambol&quot; (, &quot;Full of Islam&quot;) or &quot;Islambul&quot; (&quot;find Islam&quot;) or &quot;Islam(b)ol&quot; (&quot;old Turkic: be Islam&quot;), both in Turkish, were folk-etymological adaptations of &quot;Istanbul&quot; created after the Ottoman conquest of 1453 to express the city&#x27;s new role as the capital of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. It is first attested shortly after the conquest, and its invention was ascribed by some contemporary writers to Mehmed II himself.

The name of Istanbul is thought to be derived from the Greek phrase &quot;īs tīmbolī(n)&quot; (, translit. &quot;eis tēn pólin&quot;, &quot;to the City&quot;), and it is claimed that it had already spread among the Turkish populace of the Ottoman Empire before the conquest. However, Istanbul only became the official name of the city in 1930 by the revised Turkish Postal Law.

<doc id="102676" wikidata="Q5612967" url="?curid=102676" title="Binaural recording">
<text>Binaural recording is a method of recording sound that uses two microphones, arranged with the intent to create a 3D stereo sound sensation for the listener of actually being in the room with the performers or instruments. This effect is often created using a technique known as dummy head recording, wherein a mannequin head is fitted with a microphone in each ear. Binaural recording is intended for replay using headphones and will not translate properly over stereo speakers. This idea of a three-dimensional or &quot;internal&quot; form of sound has also translated into useful advancement of technology in many things such as stethoscopes creating &quot;in-head&quot; acoustics and IMAX movies being able to create a three-dimensional acoustic experience.

The term &quot;binaural&quot; has frequently been confused as a synonym for the word &quot;stereo&quot;, due in part to systematic misuse in the mid-1950s by the recording industry, as a marketing buzzword. Conventional stereo recordings do not factor in natural ear spacing or &quot;head shadow&quot; of the head and ears, since these things happen naturally as a person listens, generating interaural time differences (ITDs) and interaural level differences (ILDs) specific to their listening position. 

==History==
The history of binaural recording goes back to 1881. The first binaural unit, the théâtrophone, was invented by Clément Ader. It consisted of an array of spaced pairs of carbon pencil microphones installed along the front edge of the Opera Garnier. The signal was sent to subscribers through the telephone system, and required that they hold a headset up to each ear.

In the early 1930&#x27;s, several binaural &quot;heads&quot; were developed. One, referred to as &quot;Oscar&quot; was made by Bell Labs, using 1.4&quot; microphones inserted into the cheeks of a mannequin&#x27;s head, and was demonstrated at the World Fair in Chicago, in 1933. The Dutch firm, Philips, also developed a binaural head, with the microphones located at the ears, which produced a better result. These early adaptations of the mannequins used in shops to model clothes led to the moniker &quot;dummy head&quot;.

Over the course of the 20th century, advancements in microphone design and an understanding of the significance that the anatomy of the human ear played in the localization of sound led to further developments in the design of binaural heads. Their use ranged from acoustic analysis, such as to record word scoring for speech intelligibility measurement, hearing aid design, for music reproduction, and radio drama.

&quot;Demolition&quot; (1973) was the first radio drama recorded using a dummy head.

In 1974, Virgin Records issued the first solo album by Tangerine Dream&#x27;s leader Edgar Froese, titled &quot;Aqua&quot;. The sleeve notes inform listeners that the tracks &quot;NGC 891&quot; and &quot;Upland&quot; were recorded using a binaural head system developed by Gunther Brunschen. Listeners were advised to listen with stereo headphones. Although Edgar was keen to continue to use this system for subsequent recordings, it was abandoned because although it worked well through headphones, the improved sound quality did not translate adequately to a hi-fi speaker system.

In 1972, Neumann released the KU80 binaural head, which would eventually lead to the KU100 binaural head, which is widely used today.

In 1978, Lou Reed released the first commercially produced binaural pop record, &quot;Street Hassle&quot;, a combination of live and studio recordings.

Binaural sound did not take off for music reproduction for consumers due to the expensive, specialized equipment required for quality recordings, and the requirement of headphones for proper reproduction. Particularly in pre-Walkman days, most consumers considered headphones an inconvenience, and were only interested in recordings that could be listened to on a home stereo system or in automobiles. Lastly, the types of things that can be recorded do not have a typically high market value. Popular music typically involves a lot of electro-acoustic sources such as guitars and keyboards that when recorded in a studio setting would have little benefit from being recorded binaurally. Recordings that are of interest are live orchestral performances, and ambient &quot;environmental&quot; recordings of city sounds, nature, and other such subject matters.

During the 1990s, electronic devices which used digital signal processing (DSP) to reproduce HRTFs were made commercially available. These devices allowed the sound engineer to make it sound like a monophonic sound had been recorded with a binaural head, adjusting the apparent direction and proximity of a sound in real time. They were unusual and expensive, but would allow the sound engineer to alter special effects of prerecorded sounds quickly and conveniently. Software versions of these are now widely available.

The modern era has seen a resurgence of interest in binaural, partially due to the increased use of headphones, cheaper methods of recording and the general increased commercial interest in 360° audio technology.

In 2005, &quot;Aqua&quot; was remixed for limited edition reissue in Germany and Japan, with an additional track &quot;Upland Dawn&quot; appended to the end of the CD.

In 2015, Singaporean singer-songwriter JJ Lin released his debut experimental album &quot;From M.E. to Myself&quot;, using dummy head recording. This is also the first full album in the pop music industry to use this technology.

In 2015, the UK-based theatre company Complicité presented &quot;The Encounter&quot;, where an audience of up to 850 people wore wired headphones listening to a binaural soundscape that featured both binaural recordings and the sound from a KU100 binaural head onstage, which relayed sound from the performer onstage. The show toured the world, and played on Broadway for several months, winning a Tony Award for its sound design.

Binaural sound is often used in Virtual Reality, to help the user locate the source of something outside their field of vision. It also helps the user feel immersed in the experience by creating a realistic sonic landscape. Typically, this form of binaural sound is created by using monophonic recordings of sound that are processed through a binaural panner (and other processes that simulate distance, occlusion and acoustics) in real-time, based on where the user is facing.

The online ASMR community has widely employed binaural recordings.

Many of the major music streaming services have started offering &quot;Spatial Audio&quot; versions of popular music. These are often mixed using Dolby Atmos, which combines cinematic-style surround sound panning with object based panning. A smart phone, tablet or computer can be used to listen to these with headphones and the music track will be rendered into binaural sound on playback. Devices like Apple&#x27;s AirPods Pro can be used to track the rotation of the users head and allow the music sources to rotate around the listener as they rotate their head.

The increasing popularity of podcasts has seen an increase in audio drama production, and there have been many produced using binaural recording, or by recording in mono and mixing those recordings using Dolby Atmos.

==Recording techniques==


The simplest recording technique utilizes two small microphones, placed inside the ears of a human, a technique that can create very impressive first-person perspective recordings. The DPA 4560 was produced specifically for this type of recording. This technique also clearly picks up the sounds of the person wearing the microphones, their breathing, clothing rustle, and any shifts in movement they may make, which can make it impractical for many types of recording.

More common is using a binaural head, also known as a dummy head, or &quot;Kunstkopf&quot;. These typically have two microphones, 15cm apart, facing away from each other, with a head shaped mass between them. Typically these microphones will be embedded within the &quot;head&quot; with a silicone mould of a pair of ears in front of them. 

Some binaural microphones go further and include elements of the human torso, aiming to simulate how sounds are reflected off the shoulders and absorbed by body mass, known as Head and Torso Simulators (HATS). They often include more intricate detail, such as a mouth simulator.The distance between the ears, the size, weight and shape of the head and ears aim to roughly approximate those of an average human, though as very few people are actually the average size this explains some of the variance in how dramatically a binaural effect is heard by different people. 

The aim is that each microphone records sound in the same spatial relationship: each signal having the relative inter-aural time, level and timbral differences that the two ears of a human being would have if they were situated in the same position as the binaural head.

The recordings are then listened to through headphones, with the microphone from the left ear of the binaural head routed into the left headphone of the listener, and the microphone from the right ear routed into the right headphone of the listener. Our brains are then able to interpret the spatial cues within the recordings to create a three-dimensional soundscape within our consciousness because it mirrors our own hearing system. 

Like our ears, a binaural head records sounds from all directions: all the sounds of a space and a clear impression of the room acoustics. This can be a benefit or a challenge depending on what you are trying to record. A binaural head can create exceptional recordings of acoustic music concerts, for example. However, it will also clearly record any noises the audience make too.

A binaural head also mirrors the limitations of the human hearing system too. so for example when a sound is directly in front of us. there is very little difference between the sound hitting our left ear and our right ear. If a sound is directly behind us, again there is very little difference between the sound hitting our left ear and our right ear. Without the help of our visual system, we can struggle to tell if something is directly in front of us, or directly behind us, based on our hearing system alone.

== Examples of binaural microphones ==

=== Brüel &amp; Kjær Head and Torso Simulators (HATS) ===
Designed to be used in-situ for electro-acoustic tests on, for example, telephone handsets, headsets, audio conference devices, microphones, headphones, hearing aids and hearing protectors. It includes soft moulded pinnae, nose, mouth and torso. Using an MRI scanner, Brüel &amp; Kjær and DTU collected the geometries of a large population of human ears. By capturing the full ear canal geometry including the bony part adjoining the eardrum was, this data was post-processed to determine the average human ear canal geometry.

=== Neumann KU 100 ===
The Neumann KU 100 is a simple design, with a more abstract representation of a head, and &quot;realistic&quot; ears. It is not customisable. The Neumann is a commonly used binaural microphone and features use by BBC R&amp;D teams.

=== G.R.A.S. Head &amp; Torso Simulator KEMAR (HATS) ===
KEMAR was initially invented in collaboration with the audiological industry for the use of hearing aid development, and is still the de facto standard for this industry – however since then the usage of KEMAR has spread into a multitude of other industries like: telecommunications, hearing protection test, automotive development etc. KEMAR is designed using large statistical research to as close to the average human measurements as possible. Torso reflections have been seen to be a considerable contributor to creating a successful binaural recording. It has replaceable pinnae of different sizes and materials and sets of different type ear-canal simulators.

=== 3Dio range ===
The 3Dio range of binaural microphones feature two silicone ear (pinna) moulds separated by —slightly narrower than many binaural microphones. Microphones are placed inside the ears, and range from Primo EM172 in the Free Space and Free Space XLR models, to DPA 4060s in the Pro II model. The 3Dio range is considerably cheaper than the Neumann KU 100, for example, and used more on a consumer to prosumer level. There is no head mass between the ears, which allows the microphone to be lighter and more mobile, compared to other binaural microphones which can often weigh several kilograms.

=== Sound Professionals SP-TFB-2 and DPA 4560 headset microphone ===
These are both in-ear wearable stereo microphones, used like earphones, placed inside the human pinna. They use the user&#x27;s pinna and head mass to create the binaural effect.

== Alternative methods of achieving binaural sound ==
Sounds that have been recorded in mono can be placed in a three-dimensional soundstage as if they had been recorded using a binaural head by using &quot;binaural panning&quot; software, such as DearVR Pro 2 . The sound is processed using a complex mathematical algorithm imprinting inter-aural time, level, limited HRTF information, and optionally also room acoustics, onto the sound recording creating a binaural effect.

Ambisonic recording techniques can also be used to generate binaural sound recordings.

== Re-recording techniques ==
The technique of binaural re-recording is simple but has not been well established. It follows the same principles of Worldizing, a technique used by film sound designers in which sound is played over a loudspeaker in a real-world location and then re-recorded, taking along all the aspects and characteristics of the real-world environment with it. A binaural microphone is used to record content being played over a multi-channel speaker set-up. The binaural head, or microphone, is therefore theoretically making a recording of how humans will hear multi-channel content. The soundtrack to a film, for example, could be recorded by the binaural microphone with all the environmental cues of the given location, as well as reverberations.

== Known issues ==

=== Averaging ===
The main focus of recording with a binaural head is to achieve a perfect binaural playback that is suited to all listeners. The problem arises that each human head has different shaped and sized features, making it very difficult to create a binaural effect compatible for everyone&#x27;s ears. 

Averaging is done, either in the physical properties of binaural head microphones, or in the mathematical algorithm used to generate binaural sound using binaural panning software or ambisonic decoders. Some people may report hearing a very dramatic soundstage, while others may not. 

The effect that the shape of our head and our ears has on the sound we hear is part of what is called the Head Related Transfer Function, or HRTF. Recent Apple iPhone Pro&#x27;s use the phone&#x27;s camera and LiDAR Scanner to create a 3D picture of the listener&#x27;s ears, in order to create a personalized HRTF file so that their own ear shape is factored into what they hear.

===Timbral issues===
In January 2012 BBC R&amp;D worked together with BBC Radio 4 to produce a binaural production of &quot;Private Peaceful&quot;. The dramatization featured a reproduction of a 5.1 speaker system, and had 4 variations. At the start of each variation, the listener would hear a series of test signals allowing for a choice of which version gives them the best spatial experience. By doing this, BBC R&amp;D have accepted that there will be variations on the success of the binaural reproduction, and therefore provided different mixes based on different sets of HRTF data. The release of &quot;Private Peaceful&quot; had an accompanying survey which all listeners were asked to complete. It asked questions about the success that the binaural reproduction had with the listeners and which version (1-4) the listener thought was most successful.

During an interview with Chris Pike from BBC R&amp;D in September 2012, Pike stated that &quot;you may get good spatial impression but timbral coloration is often an issue&quot;. The issue of timbral coloration is mentioned in a large amount of spatial enhancement research and is sometimes seen as the outcome of the misuse or insufficient amount of HRTF data when reproducing binaural audio for example, or the fact that the end-user simply will not respond well to the collected HRTF data. Francis Rumsey states in the 2011 article &quot;Whose head is it anyway?&quot; that &quot;badly implemented HRTFs can give rise to poor timbral quality, poor externalisation, and a host of other unwanted results&quot;. Getting the HRTF data correct is a key point in making the final product a success, and possibly by making the HRTF data as extensive as possible, there will be less room for error such as timbral issues. The HRTFs used for &quot;Private Peaceful&quot; were designed by measuring impulse responses in a reverberant room, done so to capture a sense of space, but is not very external and there are obvious timbral issues as pointed out by Pike.

Juha Merimaa from Sennheiser Research Laboratories found that using HRTF filters to reduce timbral issues did not affect the spatial localization previously achieved using the data when tested on a panel of listeners. This explains that there are ways of reducing the effects of timbral issues on audio that have been processed with HRTF data, but this does mean further EQ manipulation of the audio. If this route is to be further explored, researchers will have to be happy with the fact that the audio is being manipulated in great amounts to achieve a greater sense of spatial awareness, and that this further manipulation will cause irreversible changes to the audio, something content creators may not be happy with. Consideration will have to be taken into how much manipulation is appropriate and to what extent, if any, will this affect the end users experience.

=== Issues related to headphone quality ===
Ideal listening conditions will most likely be experienced with headphones designed to give an as flat frequency response as possible in order to reduce colouration of the audio the user is listening to. But many people may only have access to low quality headphones, which can result in them hearing something very different from what was intended, and that can muddy the spatial cues in the binaural audio.

=== Loudspeaker compatibility ===
While a binaural recording can be played on a stereo loudspeaker system, the spatial cues that should only be heard by the left ear are heard by both ears, rather than only by the ear on the corresponding side, as would be the case with headphones. Likewise, with the right ear spatial cues. This means the spatial effect of the binaural sound is compromised to a degree, and in some cases can sound a little odd. It is possible to convert binaural sound into a format that sits more naturally on a stereo loudspeaker system using software, such as Logic Pro&#x27;s Binaural Post Processing plug-in.

<text>Dassault Systèmes SE () (abbreviated 3DS) is a French multinational software corporation which develops software for 3D product design, simulation, manufacturing and other 3D related products.

Founded in 1981, it is headquartered in Vélizy-Villacoublay, France, and has 23,811 employees across 194 global offices.

== History ==

=== 1980s ===
Dassault Systèmes (also known as 3DS) grew out of the aerospace industry&#x27;s search for more sophisticated drafting tools to streamline the development process and aid in the increasing complexity of aviation design. Dassault Systèmes spun out in 1981 (as part of Dassault Group) to develop and market their 3D surface design software CATI, later renamed CATIA. That same year, Dassault Systèmes signed a sales and marketing agreement with IBM, allowing IBM to resell the CATIA CAD software.

=== 1990s ===
In the 1990s, Dassault Systèmes&#x27; software was used to develop seven out of every ten new airplanes and four out of every ten new cars worldwide. Major players in the aviation and automotive industries, including Honda, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Boeing, were able to design and mock-up their products in CATIA rather than using CAD programs and physical prototypes. The Boeing 777, the Falcon 2000 business jet, and the Rafale jet fighter were designed using CATIA.

Dassault Systèmes launched an initial public offering (IPO) on both the Paris Bourse and Nasdaq in 1996. Following its success, the next year, the company acquired SolidWorks and Deneb Robotics, which later became part of the DELMIA brand, and additional software to build toward product lifecycle management (PLM). The SolidWorks acquisition strengthened Dassault Systèmes&#x27; 2D drafting capacity and provided entry into the Microsoft market, while other acquisitions added digital manufacturing software to the product lineup. These acquisitions paved the way for Dassault Systèmes to introduce a total manufacturing system with their subsidiary brand, DELMIA, in 1998. The new offering enabled access to data across the spectrum of manufacturing processes, while remaining independent of the CAD environment.

By the end of 1998, the CAD software industry vendors were devising strategies to become internet-enabled. The main focus was to enable the viewing of 3D models in web browsers and build interfaces to product data management (PDM) systems. Dassault Systèmes was one of the leaders in enabling these functions for its users. The company benefited from their experience integrating CAD software across networks for the Boeing 777 project, and had already made moves toward internet-enabled CAD software in 1996 with CATIA Conferencing Groupware; which enabled review and annotation of models using the internet. The introduction of ENOVIA further marked their industry-leading place by providing internet-enabled PDM and 3D product lifecycle management. Dassault Systèmes&#x27; acquisitions continued into 1999, when two CAD software vendors were purchased: Matra Datavision and Smart Solutions. Also in 1999, Dassault Systèmes released CATIA Version 5, which was the first version to be fully implemented in the Microsoft Windows environment.

=== 2000–2011 ===
As the demand for digital and virtual experiences increased in 2000, Dassault Systèmes launched DELMIA, which provides digital manufacturing tools for virtual planning, simulating, and modeling of production processes.

The mid-2000s heralded a series of acquisitions for Dassault Systèmes to improve their product offerings and expand their market reach, and Dassault Systèmes launched new software and tools. In 2005, Dassault Systèmes sought to improve the quality of 3D interactions and simulations. First they acquired Abaqus, a US-based company specializing in software that allows engineers to simulate and observe the performance of components in products.

Then they acquired Virtools, software that enables companies to create 3D applications. The following year, the company extended its market reach into high-tech, consumer products, and medical devices through the acquisition of MatrixOne, which would be linked with ENOVIA. In 2007, subsidiary brand 3DVIA was launched to create a social network and content community for 3D artists and modelers.

=== 2012–2019 ===
As the 2000s progressed, Dassault Systèmes began to enter online applications and build toward more online applications for product data management, collaboration, realistic simulation and more. Examples of this strategy include the purchase or launch of brands such as EXALEAD for information intelligence, NETVIBES for business analytics, 3DEXCITE for marketing, and GEOVIA for modeling the planet. In 2012, the company launched the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to connect its software applications. 

CATIA under the 3DEXPERIENCE platform enables users to go beyond physical product definition to model any product in the context of its real-life behavior. Systems, architects, engineers, designers and all contributors collaborate on fit, form, function, and customer experience. 

Dassault Systèmes also began to offer its version of digital twins, which the company calls virtual twin experiences and are powered by the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. Virtual twins help companies visualize, model and simulate an entire environment to explore how a product or process will behave when assembled, operated or subjected to a range of events. 

To expand their capabilities and industries served through the 3DEXPERIENCE platform, Dassault Systèmes completed additional acquisitions, including:

* Dynasim AB (2006)
* Simpoe S.A.S. (2013)
* Realtime Technology (2014)
* Accelrys (2014)
* Quintiq (2014)
* CST (2016)
* Outscale (majority stake, 2016)
* Centric (majority stake, 2018)
* IQMS (2018)
* Medidata Solutions (2019)
* Argosim
Throughout the decade, Dassault Systèmes advanced into the life sciences and healthcare industry, including launching the Living Heart Project for simulating heart function in 2014 and acquiring subsidiary brand MEDIDATA for managing clinical trials, in 2019.

=== 2020–present ===
In 2020, Dassault Systèmes expanded its focus from “Things to Life” by applying what they have learned over the past four decades and applying it to the human body. By developing a virtual twin experience of the human body, they can model, search, test and treat a human body as precisely, safely and effectively as cars, buildings or airplanes and customize the care of each individual. 

To expand the capabilities served through the 3DEXPERIENCE platform, Dassault Systèmes completed additional acquisitions, including:

*NuoDB (2020)
* Proxem (2020)
* Diota (2022)

In late 2022, Dassault Systèmes, along with French companies Docaposte, Bouygues Telecom and Banque des Territoires, announced plans to create Numspot, a joint effort to build a European sovereign cloud service for the financial, health and public sectors that would rely on the infrastructure of 3DS Outscale.

In 2022, the company named Philippine de T&#x27;Serclaes as its chief sustainability officer.

<doc id="102684" wikidata="Q17497140" url="?curid=102684" title="Backyard Sports">
<text>Backyard Sports (originally branded as Junior Sports and then Humongous Sports) is a video game series released for consoles, computers, and mobile devices created by Humongous Entertainment. The series is best known for starring a diverse cast of fictional children as well as child versions of famous professional sports athletes, such as Albert Pujols, Paul Pierce, Barry Bonds, Tim Duncan, Clint Mathis, Kevin Garnett, Tom Brady, David Ortiz, Joe Thornton, and Andy Macdonald. The &quot;Backyard Sports&quot; series was previously licensed by the five major professional American sports leagues: Major League Baseball (MLB), Major League Soccer (MLS), the National Football League (NFL), the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the National Hockey League (NHL), as well as their affiliated players associations. The series has changed ownership and developers several times since Humongous&#x27;s closure in 2005 and has endured a years-long hiatus from 2010 to 2024 (excluding a brief mobile game revival in 2015), when the franchise was revived by its current publisher Playground Productions.

The series includes five sub-series based on different team sports—&quot;Backyard Baseball&quot;, &quot;Backyard Soccer&quot; (association football), &quot;Backyard Football&quot; (American football), &quot;Backyard Basketball&quot;, and &quot;Backyard Hockey&quot; (ice hockey)—as well as the single game non-team sport-based &quot;Backyard Skateboarding&quot;. In the games, players form a team consisting of Backyard Kids and (in most entries) professional athletes as children, which players take through a &quot;Backyard League&quot; season, attempting to become the champions of their chosen sport. Players can create their own custom characters, starting in &quot;Backyard Football&quot; (1999). An additional aspect of the games is the use of Power-Ups, allowing players to gain &quot;Super-abilities&quot;. For instance, &quot;Super-Dunk&quot; allows a basketball player to make a dunk from nearly anywhere on the court, &quot;Leap Frog&quot; allows a football player to jump over the entire defensive line, and &quot;Ice Cream Truck&quot; causes the other team to be distracted for a brief period.

==History==
===1997–2005: Under Humongous Entertainment===
The series began in late 1997 when Humongous Entertainment, owned by GT Interactive, created the first game in the franchise: &quot;Backyard Baseball&quot;. Later, GT Interactive was purchased by Infogrames and was renamed as Infogrames, Inc. Infogrames allowed Humongous Entertainment to expand the series, and Humongous later developed more titles such as &quot;Backyard Soccer&quot;, &quot;Backyard Football&quot;, &quot;Backyard Basketball&quot;, &quot;Backyard Hockey&quot;, and &quot;Backyard Skateboarding&quot;. Following the buyout by Infogrames, these titles from the &quot;Backyard&quot; series were released for game consoles, including the GameCube, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and Wii. In 2003, Infogrames, Inc. was renamed as Atari, Inc.

===2005–2010: Under Humongous, Inc.===
In August 2005, Atari, Inc. sold Humongous Entertainment to their majority parent Infogrames Entertainment SA for shares worth . After the sale, Infogrames shuttered Humongous Entertainment and secured the studio&#x27;s assets to Humongous, Inc., a holding company formed solely for this purpose. With this point, newer &quot;Backyard Sports&quot; titles were developed by other studios for consoles and computers, with Atari, Inc. continuing to hold publishing rights to the series under license from Humongous, Inc. In March 2008, Infogrames purchased the remaining shares of Atari, Inc. that they didn&#x27;t own and renamed itself to Atari SA the following year. The two Atari businesses continued to release entries in the series within this time.

===2013–2020: Post-sale and attempted relaunch===
In July 2013, private equity firm The Evergreen Group bought the &quot;Backyard Sports&quot; franchise during the Atari bankruptcy proceedings for its portfolio company, Epic Gear LLC.

In February 2014, Day6 Sports Group acquired the franchise from Epic Gear. The company announced to relaunch the franchise in December with &quot;Backyard Sports NBA Basketball&quot; for smartphones and tablets, with Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry as the cover athlete. Two mobile games, &quot;Backyard Sports: Baseball 2015&quot; and &quot;Baseball Sports: NBA Basketball 2015&quot;, were released in February 2015, but Day6 did not release any further titles afterward, as the company was acquired by a European investment group in 2016 and later went out of business in 2020.

In April 2019, Humongous&#x27;s social media pages tweeted an image of the original &quot;Junior Sports&quot; logo, hinting at a possible re-release of the original games and/or the developer having re-secured the rights to the series proper, but a week prior, Humongous replied to a Twitter post saying that they didn&#x27;t own the rights to the franchise.

===2020–present: New ownership and full brand relaunch===
After Day6&#x27;s closure in 2020, the franchise was purchased by Ari Pinchot and Stuart Avi Savitsky via Backyard Sports LLC in 2021. While Backyard Sports LLC owns the trademarks associated with the brand, in 2024, Playground Productions LLC began to work with Pinchot and Savitsky in relaunching the IP across gaming and other verticals. This collaboration was accompanied by an animated trailer featuring several of the Backyard Kids preparing to start a game of baseball.

The franchise regained media attention in January 2024, when NFL player Jason Kelce, in an episode of his and his brother Travis&#x27;s podcast &quot;New Heights&quot;, reminisced about playing &quot;Backyard Football&quot; and &quot;Backyard Baseball&quot;, and stated his desire to purchase the rights to the brand to develop a new game in the series. It received further attention that August when Bobby Witt Jr. of the Kansas City Royals used a baseball bat themed after Pablo Sanchez, a popular character in the series, to hit a home run against the Cincinnati Reds during Major League Baseball&#x27;s Players&#x27; Weekend. 

The first entry released under Playground Productions and developer Mega Cat Studios, a remaster of the original &quot;Backyard Baseball&quot; entitled as &quot;Backyard Baseball &#x27;97&quot;, was released on October 10, 2024, followed by a remaster of &quot;Backyard Soccer&quot; entitled as &quot;Backyard Soccer &#x27;98&quot; the following month on November 27. Remasters of &quot;Backyard Football&quot;, &quot;Backyard Baseball 2001&quot;, &quot;Backyard Basketball&quot;, and &quot;Backyard Hockey&quot; are also planned. Playground Productions is collaborating with Mega Cat Studios to bring the remasters to mobile devices while developing a new original &quot;Backyard Sports&quot; title.

In early 2025, Playground Productions confirmed to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that they had signed over 60 athletes to rejoin or debut in the franchise, including Barry Sanders, Lisa Leslie, Dan Marino, and Mark McGwire.

==Games in the series==
==Other media==
In 2002, a live-action animated hour-long special based on the &quot;Backyard Football&quot; games entitled &quot;Backyard Basics&quot; aired on CBS on November 16.

In 2016, Cross Creek Pictures and Crystal City Entertainment were reportedly in development of a film based on &quot;Backyard Sports&quot; with producers Brian Oliver and Ari Daniel Pinchot. No news about the film has been revealed since. 

Along with the announcement of a new &quot;Backyard Sports&quot; title, Playground Productions revealed the development of an animated project based on the franchise, which is planned to release in 2025.

<text>Elizabeth Stamatina &quot;Tina&quot; Fey (; born May 18, 1970) is an American actress, comedian, writer, and producer. She was a cast member and head writer for the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1997 to 2006. After her departure from &quot;SNL&quot;, she created the NBC sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot; (2006–2013, 2020) and the Netflix sitcom &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot; (2015–2020), the former of which she also starred in. Fey is also known for her work in film, including &quot;Mean Girls&quot; (2004), &quot;Baby Mama&quot; (2008), &quot;Date Night&quot; (2010), &quot;Megamind&quot; (2010), &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot; (2014), &quot;Sisters&quot; (2015), &quot;Whiskey Tango Foxtrot&quot; (2016), &quot;Wine Country&quot; (2019), &quot;Soul&quot; (2020), &quot;A Haunting in Venice&quot; (2023), and &quot;Mean Girls&quot; (2024).

Fey broke into comedy as a featured player in the Chicago-based improvisational comedy group The Second City. She joined &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) as a writer, later becoming head writer and a performer, appearing as co-anchor in the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment and, later, developing a satirical portrayal of 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in subsequent guest appearances. In 2004, she co-starred in and wrote the screenplay for &quot;Mean Girls&quot;, which was adapted from the 2002 self-help book &quot;Queen Bees and Wannabes&quot;. After leaving &quot;SNL&quot; in 2006, Fey created the television series &quot;30 Rock&quot; for Broadway Video, a sitcom loosely based on her experiences at &quot;SNL&quot;. In the series, Fey starred as Liz Lemon, the head writer of a fictional sketch comedy series. In 2011, she released her memoir, &quot;Bossypants&quot;, which topped &quot;The New York Times Best Seller&quot; list for five weeks and garnered her a Grammy Award nomination. In 2015, she co-created the comedy series &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot;. Fey also created the musical adaptation &quot;Mean Girls&quot;, which premiered on Broadway in 2018, and earned her a Tony Award nomination. She later adapted the stage production into a 2024 musical film of the same name.

Fey has received numerous accolades, including nine Primetime Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, five Screen Actors Guild Awards, and seven Writers Guild of America Awards. She appeared on the &quot;Time&quot; 100 list of the 100 most influential people in the world in both 2007 and 2009. In 2008, the Associated Press gave Fey the AP Entertainer of the Year Award for her Sarah Palin impression on &quot;SNL&quot;. In 2010, Fey was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, becoming the youngest recipient of the award.

==Early life==
Elizabeth Stamatina Fey was born on May 18, 1970, in Upper Darby Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Her father, Donald Henry Fey, was a veteran of the Korean War, university administrator for the University of Pennsylvania and Thomas Jefferson University, and a grant proposal writer who raised $500 million for schools, hospitals, and public service agencies through proposals and direct mail appeals. Following her father&#x27;s death, Fey established a scholarship fund in his name at his alma mater, Temple University, to support war veterans studying journalism. Her mother, Zenobia &quot;Jeanne&quot; ( Xenakes), is a retired brokerage employee born in Piraeus, Greece. Fey&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Vasiliki Kourelakou, left the Greek village of Petrina, Laconia, on her own and arrived in the United States in February 1921. Fey&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Constantine Xenakes, was from the village of Panagia on the Greek island of Ikaria. Fey&#x27;s father had English, German and Scottish-Irish ancestry; one of her paternal ancestors was John Hewson, an English textile manufacturer who emigrated to the United States with the support of Benjamin Franklin, enabling Hewson to open a quilting factory in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. According to a genealogical DNA test arranged by the television series &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, Fey&#x27;s ancestry is 94% European, 3% Middle Eastern, and 3% from the Caucasus. She has a brother, Peter, who is eight years older.

Fey describes encountering comedy early:

At age 11, Fey read Joe Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Seventy Years of Great Film Comedians&quot; for a school project about comedy. She grew up watching &quot;Second City Television&quot; and has cited Catherine O&#x27;Hara as a role model.

Fey went by the nickname &quot;Tina&quot; at an early age. She attended Cardington-Stonehurst Elementary School and Beverly Hills Middle School in Upper Darby. By middle school, she knew she was interested in comedy. Fey attended Upper Darby High School, where she was an honors student, a member of the choir, drama club, and tennis team, and co-editor of the school&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Acorn&quot;. She anonymously wrote the newspaper&#x27;s satirical column, &quot;The Colonel&quot;. Following her graduation in 1988, Fey enrolled at the University of Virginia, where she studied playwriting and acting and was awarded the Pettway Prize. She graduated in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts, with a major in drama.

==Career==
===Career beginnings===
After college, Fey moved to Chicago. She worked as a receptionist during the day at the YMCA in Evanston, Illinois, and took performance classes at the improvisational comedy troupe The Second City at night. Fey started doing gigs at Improv Olympic where she first worked with pianist Jeff Richmond, her future husband and collaborator. Both Fey and Richmond got jobs at Second City. Fey appeared in &quot;the legendary revue &#x27;Paradigm Lost&#x27;, alongside the likes of Rachel Dratch, Kevin Dorff, Scott Adsit, Jenna Jolovitz and Jim Zulevic.&quot;

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1997–2006)===
While performing shows with The Second City in 1997, Fey submitted several scripts to NBC&#x27;s variety show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, at the request of its head writer Adam McKay, a former performer at Second City. She was hired as a writer following a meeting with &quot;SNL&quot; creator Lorne Michaels, and moved from Chicago to New York. Fey told &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;d had my eye on the show forever, the way other kids have their eye on Derek Jeter.&quot; Originally, Fey &quot;struggled&quot; at &quot;SNL&quot;. Her first sketch to air starred Chris Farley in a Sally Jessy Raphael satire. Fey went on to write a series of parodies, including one of ABC&#x27;s morning talk show &quot;The View&quot;. She co-wrote the &quot;Sully and Denise&quot; sketches with Rachel Dratch, who plays one of the teens.

Fey was an extra in a 1998 episode, and after watching herself, decided to diet and lost 30 pounds. She told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I was a completely normal weight, but I was here in New York City, I had money and I couldn&#x27;t buy any clothes. After I lost weight, there was interest in putting me on camera.&quot; In 1999, McKay stepped down as head writer, which led Michaels to approach Fey for the position. She became &quot;SNL&quot;″s first female head writer. In January 2001, she appeared on an episode of &quot;Real World/Road Rules Extreme Challenge&quot; as a judge of a comedy-based mission.

In 2000, Fey began performing in sketches, and she and Jimmy Fallon became co-anchors of &quot;SNL&quot;″s &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment. Fey said she did not ask to audition, but that Michaels approached her. Michaels explained that there was chemistry between Fey and Fallon, though he felt the decision was &quot;kind of risky&quot; at the time. Her role in &quot;Weekend Update&quot; was well received by critics. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;Fey delivers such blow darts – poison filled jokes written in long, precisely parsed sentences unprecedented in [&quot;Weekend Update&quot;] history – with such a bright, sunny countenance makes her all the more devilishly delightful.&quot; Dennis Miller, a former cast member of &quot;SNL&quot; and anchor of &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, was pleased with Fey as one of the anchors: &quot;Fey might be the best &quot;Weekend Update&quot; anchor who ever did it. She writes the funniest jokes.&quot; Robert Bianco of &quot;USA Today&quot;, however, commented that he was &quot;not enamored&quot; of the pairing.

In 2001, Fey and the rest of the writing staff won a Writers Guild of America Award for &quot;SNL&quot;″s 25th anniversary special. The following year at the 2002 Emmy Awards ceremony, they won the Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program.

When Fallon left the show in May 2004, he was replaced on &quot;Weekend Update&quot; by Amy Poehler. It was the first time that two women co-anchored &quot;Weekend Update&quot;. Fey revealed that she &quot;hired&quot; Poehler as her co-host for the segment. The reception was positive, with Rachel Sklar of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; noting that the pairing &quot;has been a hilarious, pitch-perfect success as they play off each other with quick one-liners and deadpan delivery&quot;.

The 2005–2006 season was her last; she departed to develop &quot;30 Rock&quot; for Broadway Video. At the time she left, the 117 episodes she co-hosted made her &quot;SNL&quot;″s longest-serving &quot;Weekend Update&quot; anchor, a mark that would later be passed by her replacement, Seth Meyers. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 &quot;SNL&quot; cast members to date, Fey was ranked third in importance (behind John Belushi and Eddie Murphy). They credited her with &quot;salvaging [&quot;Weekend Update&quot;] from a decade-long losing streak&quot;, and &quot;slapping &quot;SNL&quot; out of its late-nineties coma.&quot;

===&quot;30 Rock&quot; (2006–2013, 2020)===

In 2002, Fey suggested a pilot episode for a situation comedy about a cable news network to NBC, which rejected it. The pilot was reworked to revolve around an &quot;SNL&quot; style series, and was accepted by NBC. She signed a contract with NBC in May 2003, which allowed her to continue in her position within &quot;SNL&quot; as head writer at least through the 2004–2005 television season. As part of the contract, Fey was to develop a prime-time project to be produced by Broadway Video and NBC Universal. The pilot, directed by Adam Bernstein, centered on Liz Lemon (Fey), the head writer of a variety show on NBC, and how she managed her relationships with the show&#x27;s volatile stars and the new head of the network. In October 2006, the pilot aired on NBC as &quot;30 Rock&quot;. Although the episode received generally favorable reviews, it finished third in its time slot.

In 2007, Fey received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series. The show itself won the 2007 Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series (and did so again for two subsequent years). In 2008, she won the Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, and Emmy awards all in the category for Best Actress in a Comedy Series. The following year, Fey again won the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award in the same categories, and was nominated for an Emmy Award. In early 2010, Fey received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress, and won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Lead Actress. &quot;30 Rock&quot; returned for the 2011–2012 season, though due to Fey&#x27;s pregnancy with her second child, the season premiere was delayed until midseason.

Fey&#x27;s performance on the show was inspired by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and later used Louis-Dreyfus to play the stand-in for the character of Liz Lemon in flashback scenes during the live episode &quot;Live Show&quot; of the fifth season. After receiving 13 Emmy Award nominations and two wins for the final season, &quot;30 Rock&quot; ended its run with 112 Emmy Award nominations. It has been cited as one of the greatest TV series of all time and it is considered to have one of the greatest finales in television history.

The show returned for a remotely produced hourlong special which aired on July 16, 2020.

On June 23, 2020, Fey apologized for episodes of &quot;30 Rock&quot; where characters appeared in blackface. The episodes, which originally aired in seasons three, five, and six, were removed from streaming services and are no longer shown in re-runs. In her apology, Fey wrote: 

===&quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot; (2015–2020)===

In 2015, Fey created and produced the television comedy &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot; with fellow &quot;30 Rock&quot;-alumnus Robert Carlock. The series stars Ellie Kemper as the titular character who escapes from a doomsday cult and moves to New York City. It also stars Fey&#x27;s former co-star Jane Krakowski, as well as Tituss Burgess (who had previously appeared in four &quot;30 Rock&quot; episodes) and Carol Kane. Although it was originally produced for NBC, it was eventually sold to Netflix and renewed for a second season. The show premiered on March 6, 2015, to critical acclaim.

On July 16, 2015, the series was nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series. Fey was nominated both as the creator/executive producer of the series and for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her guest performance as Marcia, a bumbling prosecutor in reference to Marcia Clark.

In the second season, Fey joined the cast in the role of Kimmy&#x27;s psychiatrist Andrea Bayden, a role she reprised for season three. The season, along with the subsequent two seasons, were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, among other nominations. The fourth and final season concluded on January 25, 2019.

On May 8, 2019, it was announced that the series would return with an interactive special, which premiered on May 12, 2020. The special was released to positive reviews from critics and earned a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie.

===Feature films===
In 2002, Fey appeared in the surreal comedy &quot;Martin &amp; Orloff&quot;. She made her debut as writer and co-star of the 2004 teen comedy &quot;Mean Girls&quot;. Characters and behaviors in the film are based on Fey&#x27;s high school life at Upper Darby High School and on the non-fiction book &quot;Queen Bees and Wannabes&quot; by Rosalind Wiseman. The cast includes other past cast members of &quot;SNL&quot; including Tim Meadows, Ana Gasteyer, and Amy Poehler. The film received favorable reviews, and was a box office success, grossing US$129 million worldwide.
In a 2004 interview, Fey expressed a desire to write and direct films. In 2006, Fey worked on a script for Paramount Pictures, which was to feature Sacha Baron Cohen, by the name of &quot;Curly Oxide and Vic Thrill&quot;, based loosely on the true story of a Hasidic rock musician. In 2007, she was cast in the animated comedy film &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters&quot; as the Aqua Teens&#x27; mother, a giant burrito.

She received her SAG card after appearing in &quot;Artie Lange&#x27;s Beer League&quot; released in 2006, in which she was compelled to join for &quot;a thousand dollars&quot;.

Fey and former &quot;SNL&quot; castmate Amy Poehler starred in the 2008 comedy &quot;Baby Mama&quot;. The film was written and directed by Michael McCullers. The plot concerns Kate (Fey), a business woman, who wants a child but, discovering she has only a million-to-one chance of getting pregnant, decides to find a surrogate: Angie (Poehler), an obnoxious schemer. &quot;Baby Mama&quot; received mixed reviews, but critics enjoyed Fey&#x27;s performance. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Fey is a delight to watch throughout. Able to convey Kate&#x27;s intentions and feelings through the simple looks and inflections, she never melodramatizes her situation; nor does her efficient, perfectionist side become overbearing.&quot; The movie grossed over US$64 million at the box office.

Fey&#x27;s projects after 2008 include a voice role in the English-language version of the Japanese animated film &quot;Ponyo&quot;. In 2009, she appeared in &quot;The Invention of Lying&quot;. Her next film role was in Shawn Levy&#x27;s 2010 comedy &quot;Date Night&quot;, a feature that focuses on a married couple, played by Fey and Steve Carell, who go on a date; however, the night goes awry for the two. Also in the same year, she voiced Roxanne &quot;Roxie&quot; Ritchi, a television reporter, in the DreamWorks animated film &quot;Megamind&quot; (2010). With a total worldwide gross of US$321 million, &quot;Megamind&quot; is Fey&#x27;s most commercially successful picture to date. It earned US$173 million outside the U.S. and US$148 million domestically.

In 2013, Fey starred alongside Paul Rudd in the romantic comedy-drama film &quot;Admission&quot;, based on the Jean Hanff Korelitz novel by the same name. The film was directed by Paul Weitz. Fey later starred in the 2014 comedy-drama &quot;This Is Where I Leave You&quot;, helmed by &quot;Date Night&quot; director Shawn Levy. As was the case with &quot;Baby Mama&quot;, although both of these films received generally mixed reviews, Fey&#x27;s performances were well received by film critics.

In 2015, it was announced Fey would be the narrator for the Disneynature film &quot;Monkey Kingdom&quot;, which was released in theaters on April 17, 2015. She again worked with Poehler, starring in the 2015 comedy film &quot;Sisters&quot; as the title characters, and received positive reviews for her role. In 2016, Fey starred in the biographical war comedy-drama &quot;Whiskey Tango Foxtrot&quot;, based on the memoir &quot;The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan&quot;, to mixed reviews, with some criticizing the whitewashing of characters of color in the film. Fey dedicated the film to her late father, Don Fey, a veteran, writer, university administrator, and firefighter.

Fey had a supporting role in the comedy film &quot;Wine Country&quot;, longtime collaborator Amy Poehler&#x27;s directorial debut, which was released on Netflix in 2019. In August 2019, it was announced that Fey would voice 22, the co-lead role in the Pixar fantasy comedy adventure film &quot;Soul&quot;, which was released on Disney+ in December 2020 to critical acclaim. The film went on to receive three Academy Award nominations, including a win for Best Animated Feature. For her performance, Fey won the Critics&#x27; Choice Super Award for Best Voice Actress in an Animated Movie.

In 2023, Fey starred alongside Jon Hamm in the black comedy film &quot;Maggie Moore(s)&quot;, directed by John Slattery. That same year, she starred as the fictional novelist Ariadne Oliver in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s mystery film &quot;A Haunting in Venice&quot;, his third featuring Hercule Poirot and based on Agatha Christie novels. Fey was a part of the ensemble, alongside Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Dornan.

In 2024, Fey wrote, produced, and starred in the musical comedy film &quot;Mean Girls&quot;. It is an adaptation of the stage musical &quot;Mean Girls&quot;, itself based on the original film she wrote and starred in. Fey reprised her role as Ms. Sharon Norbury in the film.

===Subsequent &quot;SNL&quot; appearances===

On February 23, 2008, Fey hosted the first episode of &quot;SNL&quot; after the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. For this appearance, she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in the category of Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program. Fey hosted &quot;SNL&quot; for a second time on April 10, 2010, and for her appearance she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.

From September to November 2008, Fey made multiple guest appearances on &quot;SNL&quot; to perform a series of parodies of Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. On the 34th-season premiere episode, aired September 13, 2008, Fey imitated Palin in a sketch, alongside Amy Poehler as Hillary Clinton. Their repartee included Clinton needling Palin about her &quot;Tina Fey glasses&quot;. The sketch quickly became NBC&#x27;s most-watched viral video, with 5.7 million views by the following Wednesday. Fey reprised this role on the show of October 4, on the show of October 18 where she was joined by the real Sarah Palin, and on the show of November 1, where she was joined by John McCain and his wife Cindy. The show of October 18 had the best ratings of any &quot;SNL&quot; show since 1994. The following year Fey won an Emmy in the category of Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her impersonation of Palin. Fey returned to &quot;SNL&quot; in April 2010, and reprised her impression of Palin in one sketch titled the &quot;Sarah Palin Network&quot;. Fey once again did her impression of Palin when she hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on May 8, 2011. She hosted again on September 28, 2013. Fey returned to host on December 19, 2015, for which she won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. Her most recent hosting appearance was on May 19, 2018, during which she revived her Sarah Palin impression.

She served as one of the presenters on the December 18, 2021 episode hosted by Paul Rudd, in an emergency restructuring of the episode due to a surge in cases of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. This included her doing Weekend Update with incumbent co-anchor Michael Che.

In December 2009, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put her Palin impersonation on its end-of-the-decade &quot;best-of&quot; list, writing, &quot;Fey&#x27;s freakishly spot-on &quot;SNL&quot; impersonation of the wannabe VP (and her ability to strike a balance between comedy and cruelty) made for truly transcendent television.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called her Palin impression &quot;[arguably] the most brilliant move &quot;SNL&quot; ever made&quot;.

===Other work===

In 1997, Fey and other members of The Second City provided voices for the pinball game &quot;Medieval Madness&quot;.

In 2000, Fey partnered with fellow &quot;SNL&quot; cast member Rachel Dratch in the Off Broadway two-woman show &quot;Dratch &amp; Fey&quot; at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in New York City. The production was well received by critics. Tim Townsend of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that the fun part of watching Fey and Dratch perform was &quot;seeing how comfortable they are with each other&quot;. He concluded that the production &quot;isn&#x27;t about two women being funny ... Dratch and Fey are just funny. Period.&quot; One of the &quot;SNL&quot; sketches, &quot;Sully and Denise&quot;, originated at The Second City.

On April 5, 2011, Fey&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Bossypants&quot;, was released to a positive review from &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Critic Janet Maslin reviewed the book, saying that &quot;&quot;Bossypants&quot; isn&#x27;t a memoir. It&#x27;s a spiky blend of humor, introspection, critical thinking and Nora Ephron-isms for a new generation.&quot;

In 2011, Fey narrated &quot;The Secret Life of Girls&quot;, a two-hour-long radio documentary produced by The Kitchen Sisters. She introduced stories of women and girls from around the world, and also shared memories of her own girlhood and mother.

Also in 2021, Fey began a recurring role as Cinda Canning, a true crime podcaster, in the Hulu mystery comedy series &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot;. In the same year, Fey reprised her role as 22 in the short film &quot;22 vs. Earth&quot;.

In March 2020, Netflix announced a 20-episode order for the animated sitcom &quot;Mulligan&quot;, with Fey as executive producer alongside frequent collaborators Sam Means and Robert Carlock. She also voiced the character of Dr. Farrah Braun in the series, which premiered in May 2023.

==Comedic and acting style==
Fey is known for her deadpan humor and delivery; her &quot;sardonic wit&quot; has become a professional trademark, upon which several critics have commented in their reviews of Fey&#x27;s work. According to &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Mary McNamara, Fey &quot;project[s] both oblivious security and hyper-alert insecurity with the same expression&quot; in her performances, while &quot;The Chronicle&quot; Dillon Fernando wrote that the actress specializes in &quot;delectable, situational and ironic comedy&quot;. On Fey&#x27;s comedic prowess, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; creator Lorne Michaels enthused that his former employee &quot;has a very clear take on things ... It always comes from a place of intelligence and there is just an edge to it.&quot; Michaels concluded, &quot;It&#x27;s not fearful. It&#x27;s strong and confident and you recognise the voice and most of the time you agree with it.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Christopher Goodwin believes that Fey &quot;fashioned her comic persona around her glasses&quot;, which she has worn since 1995; Fey joked that &quot;Glasses make anyone look smarter.&quot;
Seldom hesitating to use herself as the butt of her own jokes, Fey is also well known for practicing self-deprecating humor, as demonstrated throughout her performance as Liz Lemon in &quot;30 Rock&quot;. In an article ranking Fey&#x27;s six greatest jokes, David Renshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the performer&#x27;s work continues to feature her &quot;trademark mix of snark, self-deprecation, and pop-culture smarts.&quot; Fey&#x27;s self-deprecating comedic style inspired Ashley Fetters of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; to recognize her as comedian Phyllis Diller&#x27;s successor because of their similar humor. Critics have been divided in their opinions and discussions of Fey&#x27;s use of self-deprecating humor, and its effect on women as a female comic; while blogger Kate Harding disapproved of Fey&#x27;s performance in &quot;30 Rock&quot; because &quot;I&#x27;m torn between being sad that she apparently doesn&#x27;t see [beauty] in herself and being pissed off that she&#x27;s reinforcing the idea that having brown hair, glasses, and a figure that&#x27;s maybe a size 2 instead of a 0 actually equals ugly&quot;, Jessica G. of &quot;Jezebel&quot; defended the actress, writing that Fey&#x27;s performance is &quot;supposed to be &quot;parodying&quot; precisely the kinds of media that reinforce ideas that unconventional women are unworthy.&quot; Writing that Harding misunderstood Fey&#x27;s intentions, the author concluded that her self-deprecation &quot;is &quot;precisely&quot; what makes her relatable&quot;, elaborating that &quot;[women] have many moments of self-doubt, and seeing someone as successful as Tina Fey be self-deprecating gives us all permission to be imperfect.&quot; Sophie Caldecott of &quot;Verily&quot; defended Fey&#x27;s modesty and tendency to downplay her own physical appearance: &quot;She mocks her own appearance, sure, but she does so in a way that consistently shows up our culture for placing so much importance on how women look, as if that&#x27;s the most interesting thing about us ... Her comic persona on &quot;30 Rock&quot;, Liz Lemon, can be laughed at for many things, but her career managerial style and ability is not one of them.&quot; Caldecott concluded, &quot;In reality, self-deprecation is an art that comedians everywhere dabble in ... In fact, I defy you to find a good male comedian who isn&#x27;t a master of self-deprecation. Comedians make fun of themselves for many reasons, mostly because it is the most readily accessible source of inspiration but also because it is the most generous one.&quot; Observing that Fey&#x27;s material lacks &quot;whining&quot;, Gina Barreca of the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; wrote that Fey&#x27;s comedy &quot;is not simply an iteration of self-deprecating femininity passing itself off as humor. In itself, this demarcates the current generation of female humorists from earlier generations of performers who were told, more or less, to use themselves not as a sounding board for ideas but as a punching bag for insults.&quot; Fey has also garnered criticism for being politically incorrect, but she defends her right to write borderline jokes, saying that she has chosen to &quot;opt out&quot; of the culture of demanding apologies.

As an actress, Fey has developed a reputation for portraying &quot;the hilarious, self-deprecating unmarried career woman&quot; in most of her films to-date. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;″s Janice Paige defended her limited filmography by writing that, unlike most film actors, Fey remains &quot;realistic about her range as a leading lady and says she&#x27;s been deliberate about only taking on parts for which she actually seems suited.&quot; Fey explained that she approaches each role asking herself, &quot;Would I be plausible in this role, in this job?&quot; However, her role as Kate Ellis in 2015&#x27;s &quot;Sisters&quot; provided Fey with an opportunity to stray from playing the type-A female characters for which she has become known. &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic A. O. Scott wrote, &quot;We&#x27;re used to seeing Ms. Fey ... as an anxious overthinker using her caustic sarcasm as a weapon against both her own insecurities and the flakes and train wrecks who surround her. This time, she gets to be the train wreck.&quot; In &quot;30 Rock&quot;, Fey&#x27;s acting was influenced by both physical and improvisational comedy while, as a writer, her &quot;carefully written scripts&quot; were often quirky and character-driven.

Fey stated that some of the artists who inspired her in her career include British feminist playwright Caryl Churchill, comedian Chris Rock, and composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim.

==Public image==

In 2001, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named Fey as one of their Entertainers of the Year for her work on &quot;Weekend Update&quot;. In 2007, she was named one of the magazine&#x27;s Entertainers of the Year, and placed number two in 2008. In 2009, Fey was named as &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; fifth individual in their 15 Entertainers of the 2000s list. In 2013, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; crowned Fey as &quot;The Once and Future Queen&quot; (an allusion to &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;) in their feature on &quot;Women Who Run TV&quot;, calling her &quot;the funniest woman in the free world.&quot; &quot;EW&quot; quoted Mindy Kaling as saying, &quot;I always feel unoriginal bringing up Tina as my inspiration, but she&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s inspiration for a reason.&quot; The column also quoted praise by Zooey Deschanel and Lena Dunham.

In 2002, Fey was ranked in the Hot 100 List at number 80 on &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine, which used photos taken earlier by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; calling her &quot;the thinking man&#x27;s sex symbol&quot;. She was named one of &quot;People magazine&#x27;s&quot; 50 Most Beautiful People in 2003, and continued as one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Most Beautiful People in 2007, 2008, and 2009. In 2007, Fey placed seventh on the Hot 100 List on AfterEllen.com. She repeated the appearance the following year, being voted as number one on the list.

The newspaper editors and broadcast producers of the Associated Press voted Fey the AP Entertainer of the Year as the performer who had the greatest impact on culture and entertainment in 2008, citing her impression of Sarah Palin on &quot;SNL&quot;. She has appeared on &quot;Forbes&quot; annual Celebrity 100 list of the 100 most powerful celebrities in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 at No. 99, No. 86, No. 90, No. 92, and No. 79 respectively.

Fey was among the Time 100, a list of the 100 most influential people in the world, in 2007 and 2009, as selected annually by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Fey&#x27;s featured article for the 2009 list was written by &quot;30 Rock&quot; co-star, Alec Baldwin. She was selected by Barbara Walters as one of America&#x27;s 10 Most Fascinating People of 2008.

In September 2011, Fey was ranked at the top of Forbes magazine&#x27;s list of the highest-paid TV actresses. In June 2010, it was announced Fey would receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011. In 2014, Fey was recognized by &quot;Elle magazine&quot; during The Women in Hollywood Awards, honoring women for their outstanding achievements in film, spanning all aspects of the motion picture industry, including acting, directing, and producing.

In 2019, Fey was proclaimed the best comedian of the 21st century by &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

==Charity work==
Fey is a supporter of Mercy Corps, a global relief and development organization, in their campaign to end world hunger. Fey narrated a video for Mercy Corps&#x27;s Action Center in New York City, describing hunger as a symptom of many wider world problems. She also supports the Love Our Children USA organization, which fights violence against children, who named her among their Mothers Who Make a Difference, in 2009. She was the 2009 national spokesperson for the Light the Night Walk, which benefits the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society.

Fey has granted wishes for The Make-A-Wish Foundation and hosted the 2018 Power of a Wish Gala in New York City.

==Personal life==
In 1994, two years after Fey joined Chicago&#x27;s Second City improvisational theatre troupe, she began dating Jeff Richmond, a pianist who later became Second City&#x27;s musical director and then a composer on &quot;30 Rock&quot;. They married in a Greek Orthodox ceremony on June 3, 2001. They have two daughters. In April 2009, Fey and Richmond purchased a US$3.4 million apartment on the Upper West Side in New York City.

Fey has a scar a few inches long on the left side of her chin and cheek. It was caused by her being slashed in the face by a stranger while she was playing in the front yard of her house when she was five years old.

==Filmography and awards==

Among her numerous accolades, Fey has won nine Primetime Emmy Awards, three Golden Globes, five Screen Actors Guild Awards, seven Writers Guild Awards, and three Producers Guild Awards. She has also been nominated for a Grammy Award and a Tony Award.

In 2008, she received the AP Entertainer of the Year Award from the Associated Press. In 2010, Fey was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, becoming the youngest-ever recipient of the award, and it was announced that she would receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011. In 2018, Fey received the Herb Sargent Award for Comedy Excellence from the Writers Guild of America together with frequent collaborator Robert Carlock.

<doc id="102687" wikidata="Q55135017" url="?curid=102687" title="Knockout Kings">
<text>Knockout Kings is a series of boxing video games produced by EA Sports for various platforms yearly between 1998 and 2003, and was replaced by the Fight Night series in 2004.

Before releasing the first &quot;Knockout Kings&quot;, Electronic Arts released its first 3D boxing game, &quot;Foes of Ali&quot;, for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in 1995. While there are a few similarities between the two games, &quot;Foes of Ali&quot; was developed by a different team, Gray Matter, and as such, is not regarded as a precursor.

== &quot;Gameplay&quot; ==
The duration of a round can be adjusted to either 90 seconds or 3 minutes. In the game&#x27;s &quot;slugfest&quot; mode, fighters can knock each other out at any given moment of the fight, or suffer 6 or 7 knockdowns and still last for the whole fight. There are several differences between Knockout Kings, Knockout Kings 2000, and Knockout Kings 2001 in particular, the most notable being the graphics.

In &quot;Knockout Kings&quot;, the boxer sprites, although distinctive, are not facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last only up to 10 rounds and not for 12 as in real life or 15 as in the past. In between rounds, all that is seen is a ring-card girl. In Career Mode, user created fighters fight all the way up the ladder, defeating the top contenders and eventually defeating the champion. After beating the title holder, the new champion defends the championship multiple times until retirement. A created boxer can fight in Career Mode and Slugfest Mode, but not in Exhibition mode. Although there is a training mode within Career Mode, it is extremely basic. However, 2 aspects that Knockout Kings has which the sequels lack is that the referee does a mandatory eight-count when a fighter is knocked down whereas in the sequels the referee stops the count immediately after a fighter gets up from a knockdown, and, in Career Mode, the result of a fight is afterwards seen on the screen as front-page newspaper headlines.

The Knockout Kings game series gives users a chance to compete against numerous real fighters, such as Muhammad Ali, Eric Esch, Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, Larry Holmes, Jake LaMotta, Roberto Durán, Alexis Argüello, and Ray Mancini. Fake amateur boxing legends, such as Daryl ‘Hotcakes’ McGee, The Great Smokey Maggard, Boto Bondingo, and Flute Top Terry, could also be unlocked by gaining certain achievements.

== &quot;Knockout Kings 2000&quot; ==
In &quot;Knockout Kings 2000&quot; for the PS, the boxer sprites are for the first time facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last up to 15 rounds. Sound and Music volume can also be adjusted in Option Mode. In between rounds, users may see either a ring-card girl, a replay of a part of the previous round, or the boxer the user is representing sitting at his corner together with the statistics so far of the bout. Injury to the face of boxers can also be recognized, as well as his mouth-piece flying out if he is hit by a hard punch. A created boxer in Career Mode can now fight in all modes. The training mode within Career Mode is more specific. Users can now control their boxer while he is training and, in the PS version, users can also choose the location of a gym. Each boxer in the PS version can also be seen entering into the ring just before the bout takes place. There is also a new Mode where the player can see the statistics and biography of all the real-life boxers in the game, and another mode in which the player can re-live famous classic bouts. The user-interface and intro-theme of the PS version is different from the N64 version and there are also more boxers, while the graphics on each version are similar.

==&quot;Knockout Kings 2001&quot;==
&quot;Knockout Kings 2001&quot; features many well known boxers such as Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Rocky Marciano, Michael Grant, Lennox Lewis, Joe Louis, and Jack Dempsey. It also features arenas such as Caesars Palace, Madison Square Garden, Wembley Arena, and the Roman Coliseum, among others.

&quot;Knockout Kings 2001&quot; is largely considered the best boxing game on the original PlayStation. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the PS2 version a score of 30 out of 40.

&quot;Knockout Kings 2001&quot; contains the same improvements as Knockout Kings 2000 and adds more. Whereas fighters in KO Kings and KO Kings 2000 are either &quot;boxer&quot; or &quot;slugger&quot; style fighters, the styles of fighters in KO Kings 2001 are either &quot;boxer&quot;, &quot;slugger&quot;, &quot;freestyle&quot;, or &quot;crab&quot;, and these differences of style are very noticeable during bouts. Commentary in KO Kings 2001 is also far more vocal than its predecessors. During Career Mode, a boxing trainer trainer will occasionally talk and give users advice in between rounds as the bout progresses. A fighter in Career Mode is made to retire after winning the title and defending it for several times. KO Kings 2001 is also the first game of the series to introduce CPU vs CPU bouts and &quot;fantasy match-ups&quot; between famous boxers of different eras, and the first to introduce women&#x27;s boxing, which is accessible in Exhibition Mode. The PS and PS2 versions of &quot;Knockout Kings 2001&quot; are virtually identical.

== Knockout Kings 2002 ==
&quot;Knockout Kings 2002&quot; changes many concepts of its predecessors, e.g. users have to progress through a number of bouts in order to unlock new fighters.

==&quot;Knockout Kings 2003&quot;==
The final game of &quot;Knockout Kings&quot;, is Knockout Kings 2003 developed by GameFlow Entertainment and EA Redwood Studios. It was released exclusively on GameCube in 2002.

After &quot;Knockout Kings 2003&quot;, the name of the series was replaced by &quot;Fight Night (EA video game series)&quot;.

<doc id="102688" wikidata="Q191903" url="?curid=102688" title="Autocephaly">
<text>Autocephaly (; ) is the status of a hierarchical Christian church whose head bishop does not report to any higher-ranking bishop. The term is primarily used in Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches. The status has been compared with that of the churches (provinces) within the Anglican Communion.

==Overview of autocephaly==
In the first centuries of the history of the Christian church, the autocephalous status of a local church was promulgated by canons of the ecumenical councils. There developed the pentarchy, i.e., a model of ecclesiastical organization where the universal Church was governed by the primates (patriarchs) of the five major episcopal sees of the Roman Empire: Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. The independent (autocephalous) position of the Church of Cyprus by ancient custom was recognized against the claims of the Patriarch of Antioch, at the Council of Ephesus (431); it is unclear whether the Church of Cyprus had always been independent, or was once part of the Church of Antioch. When the Patriarch of Antioch claimed the Church of Cyprus was under its jurisdiction, the Cypriot clergy denounced this before the Council of Ephesus. The Council ratified the autocephaly of the Church of Cyprus by a resolution which conditionally states: &quot;If, as it is asserted in memorials and orally by the religious men who have come before the Council - it has not been a continuous ancient custom for the bishop of Antioch to hold ordinations in Cyprus, - the prelates of Cyprus shall enjoy, free from molestation and violence, their right to perform by themselves the ordination of bishops [for their island]&quot;. After the Council of Ephesus, the Church of Antioch never again claimed that Cyprus was under its jurisdiction. The Church of Cyprus has since been governed by the Archbishop of Cyprus, who is not subject to any higher ecclesiastical authority.

== Autocephaly in Eastern Orthodoxy ==
In Eastern Orthodoxy, the right to grant autocephaly is nowadays a contested issue, the main opponents in the dispute being the Ecumenical Patriarchate, which claims this right as its prerogative, and the Russian Orthodox Church (the Moscow Patriarchate), which insists that one autocephalous jurisdiction has the right to grant independence to one of its components. Thus, the Orthodox Church in America was granted autocephaly in 1970 by the Moscow Patriarchate, but this new status was not recognized by most patriarchates. During the medieval period, Orthodox empires wanted their church to be &quot;equal&quot; to the state and declare their own patriarchates. In the modern era, the issue of autocephaly has been closely linked to the issue of self-determination and political independence of a nation; self-proclamation of autocephaly was normally followed by a long period of non-recognition and schism with the mother church.

===Modern-era historical precedents===
Following the establishment of an independent Greece in 1832, the Greek government in 1833 unilaterally proclaimed the Orthodox church in the kingdom (until then within the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate) to be autocephalous; but it was not until June 1850 that the mother church (i.e. the Ecumenical Patriarchate), under the Patriarch Anthimus IV, recognized this status.

In May 1872, the Bulgarian Exarchate, set up by the Ottoman government two years prior, broke away from the Ecumenical Patriarchate, following the start of the people&#x27;s struggle for national self-determination. The Bulgarian Church was recognized in 1945 as an autocephalous patriarchate, following the end of World War II and after decades of schism. By that time, Bulgaria was ruled by the Communist party and was behind the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; of the Soviet Union.

Following the Congress of Berlin (1878), which established Serbia&#x27;s political independence, full ecclesiastical independence for the Metropolitanate of Belgrade was negotiated and recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate in 1879. Additionally, in the course of the 1848 revolution, following the proclamation of the Serbian Vojvodina (&quot;Serbian Duchy&quot;) within the Austrian Empire in May 1848, the autocephalous Patriarchate of Karlovci was instituted by the Austrian government. It was abolished in 1920, shortly after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918 following the Great War. Vojvodina was then incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The Patriarchate of Karlovci was merged into the newly united Serbian Orthodox Church under Patriarch Dimitrije residing in Belgrade, the capital of the new country that comprised all the Serb-populated lands.

The autocephalous status of the Romanian Church, legally mandated by the local authorities in 1865, was recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate in 1885, following the international recognition of the independence of the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia (later Kingdom of Romania) in 1878.

In late March 1917, following the abdication of the Russian tsar Nicholas II earlier that month and the establishment of the Special Transcaucasian Committee, the bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church in Georgia, then within the Russian Empire, unilaterally proclaimed independence of the Georgian Orthodox Church. This was not recognized by the Moscow Patriarchate until 1943, nor by the Ecumenical Patriarchate until 1990.

In September 1922, Albanian Orthodox clergy and laymen proclaimed autocephaly of the Church of Albania at the Great Congress in Berat. The church was recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople in 1937.

The independent Kyiv Patriarchate was proclaimed in 1992, shortly after the proclamation of independence of Ukraine and the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. The Moscow Patriarchate has condemned it as schismatic, as it claims jurisdiction over Ukraine. Some Orthodox churches have not yet recognized Ukraine as autocephalous. In 2018, the problem of autocephaly in Ukraine became a fiercely contested issue and a part of the overall geopolitical confrontation between Russia and Ukraine, as well as between the Moscow Patriarchate and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.

=== Autocephalous and autonomous Eastern Orthodox churches ===


=== Honorary use of the term ===
Historically, within the Patriarchate of Constantinople, adjective &quot;autocephalous&quot; was sometimes also used as an honorary designation, without connotations to real autocephaly. Such uses occurred in very specific situations. If a diocesan bishop was exempt from jurisdiction of his metropolitan, and also transferred to the direct jurisdiction of the patriarchal throne, such bishop would be styled as an &quot;autocephalous archbishop&quot; (self-headed, just in terms of not having a metropolitan). 

Such honorary uses of the adjective &quot;autocephalous&quot; were recorded in various &quot;Notitiae Episcopatuum&quot; and other sources, mainly from the early medieval period. For example, until the end of the 8th century, bishop of Amorium was under the jurisdiction of metropolitan of Pessinus, but was later exempt and placed under direct patriarchal jurisdiction. On that occasion, he was given an honorary title of an &quot;autocephalous archbishop&quot;, but with no jurisdiction over other bishops, and thus no real autocephaly. Sometime later (), metropolitan province of Amorium was created, and local archbishop gained regional jurisdiction as a metropolitan, still having no autocephaly since his province was under supreme jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.

<text>Full communion is a communion or relationship of full agreement among different Christian denominations or Christian individuals that share certain essential principles of Christian theology. Views vary among denominations on exactly what constitutes full communion, but typically when two or more denominations are in full communion it enables services and celebrations, such as the Eucharist, to be shared among congregants or clergy of any of them with the full approval of each.

==Definition and terminology==

Full communion is an ecclesiological term for an established relationship between Christian denominations that may be constituted by shared eucharist, doctrine, and ecclesiology. Different denominations emphasize different aspects or define the term differently.

Several Protestant denominations base their idea of full communion on the Augsburg Confession which says that &quot;the true unity of the church&quot; is present where &quot;the gospel is rightly preached and sacraments rightly administered.&quot; They believe that full communion between two denominations is not a merger, but rather is when two denominations develop a relationship based on a mutual understanding, respect and recognition of Baptism and sharing of the Lord&#x27;s Supper. They may worship together, exchange clergy, and share commitments to evangelism and service. For example, groups recognized as being in full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church, on this basis, include the Presbyterian Church (USA), Reformed Church in America, United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church (United States), the Moravian Church, and the United Methodist Church. These churches are not necessarily in full communion with each other, however; each denomination is free to develop its own relationships with other churches. For example, The Episcopal Church, in addition to being a member of the Anglican Communion, is in full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Moravian Church (Northern and Southern Provinces), Mar Thoma Syrian Church of India, Old Catholic Churches of the Union of Utrecht, Philippine Independent Church, and the Church of Sweden. They are not, currently, in full communion with the Presbyterian Church (USA), Reformed Church in America, or the United Church of Christ, though they are currently in dialogue with other churches; including the United Methodist Church, Presbyterian Church (USA), and Roman Catholic Church.

==By Christian denomination==

=== Catholic Church ===

====Full versus partial communion====

The Catholic Church makes a distinction between full and partial communion: where full communion exists, there is but the one Church; partial communion, on the other hand, exists where some elements of Christian faith are held in common, but complete unity on essentials is lacking. Accordingly, they see the Church as in partial communion with Protestants and in much closer, but still incomplete, communion with Orthodox Churches. It has expressed this distinction in documents such as &quot;Unitatis redintegratio&quot;, the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s decree on ecumenism, which states: &quot;quite large communities came to be separated from full communion with the Catholic Church. [...] Men who believe in Christ and have been truly baptized are in communion with the Catholic Church even though this communion is imperfect&quot;.

Nonetheless, the Second Vatican Council used the word &quot;communion&quot; in a sense other than &quot;communio in sacris&quot; when speaking of Christians separated from the Catholic Church. The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, citing the Second Vatican Council and Pope Paul VI, states:

Full communion thus involves completeness of &quot;those bonds of communion – faith, sacraments and pastoral governance – that permit the Faithful to receive the life of grace within the Church.&quot;

====Universal and particular Churches====

In Catholicism, the &quot;universal Church&quot; means Catholicism itself, from the Greek adjective καθολικός (katholikos), meaning &quot;universal&quot;. The term particular church denotes an ecclesiastical community headed by a bishop or equivalent, and this can include both local dioceses as well as autonomous (or &quot;sui juris&quot;) particular churches, which include other rites such as the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches.

A 1992 Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) letter to Catholic bishops expressed this idea as: &quot;the universal Church cannot be conceived as the sum of the particular Churches, or as a federation of particular Churches&quot;&#x27;. It is not the result of the communion of the Churches, but, in its essential mystery, it is a reality &quot;ontologically&quot; and &quot;temporally&quot; prior to every &quot;individual&quot; particular Church&quot;.

====List of Catholic churches in full communion====

====Sharing in the Eucharist====

As a practical matter for most Catholics, full communion means that a member of one Church may partake of the Eucharist celebrated in another, and for priests, that they are accepted as celebrants of the Eucharist in the other Church.

Restrictions in this matter were already in force in the second century as witnessed to by Justin Martyr in his &quot;First Apology&quot;: &quot;No one is allowed to partake (of the Eucharist) but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined.&quot;

For acceptance into full communion with the Catholic Church a specific profession of the faith of the Catholic Church is required even of those who have been members of a separate church whose sacraments the Catholic Church considers to be valid. Being &quot;in full communion with the Catholic Church&quot; requires that they &quot;firmly accept&quot; its teaching on faith and morals.

Intercommunion usually means an agreement between churches by which all members of each church (clergy with clergy, or laity with laity, respectively) may participate in the other&#x27;s Eucharistic celebrations or may hold joint celebrations. The Catholic Church has entered into no such agreement: it allows no Eucharistic concelebration by its clergy with clergy of churches not in full communion with it.

The Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism indicates the limited circumstances in which Catholics may receive the Eucharist from clergy of churches not in full communion (never if those churches are judged not to have valid apostolic succession and thus valid Eucharist), and in which Catholic clergy may administer the sacraments to members of other churches.

The norms there indicated for the giving of the Eucharist to other Christians () are summarized in canon 844 of the Latin Church&#x27;s 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;. The &quot;Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches&quot; (CCEO) indicates that the norms of the Directory apply also to the clergy and laity of the Eastern Catholic Churches.

===Eastern Orthodox===
Eastern Orthodox have an understanding of what full communion means that is very similar to that of the Catholic Church. Though they have no figure corresponding to that of the Roman Catholic Pope, performing a function like that of the Pope&#x27;s Petrine Office for the whole of their respective communions, they see each of their autocephalous churches as embodiments of, respectively, the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. They too consider full communion an essential condition for common sharing in the Eucharist.

For the autocephalous churches that form the Eastern Orthodox Church, see Eastern Orthodox Church organization. Their number is somewhat in dispute.

===Church of the East===
The Church of the East is currently divided into churches that are not in full communion with one another. The Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East divided in the 20th century over the former&#x27;s limitation of the post of patriarch to members of a single family and due to the adoption of the New Calendar by the former. There is movement towards reunity, but they are not in full communion with one another at present. The Chaldean Catholic Church shares a similar history with both, but is currently in full communion with neither. The Catholic Church, of which the Chaldean Church is part, allows its ministers to give the Eucharist to members of Eastern churches who seek it on their own accord and are properly disposed, and it allows its faithful who cannot approach a Catholic minister to receive the Eucharist, when necessary or spiritually advantageous, from ministers of non-Catholic churches that have a recognised Eucharist.

The &quot;Guidelines for Admission to the Eucharist between the Chaldean Church and the Assyrian Church of the East&quot; explicitly apply these rules, which hold also for the Ancient Church of the East and all Eastern Orthodox churches, to the Assyrian Church of the East. &quot;When necessity requires, Assyrian faithful are permitted to participate and to receive Holy Communion in a Chaldean celebration of the Holy Eucharist; in the same way, Chaldean faithful for whom it is physically or morally impossible to approach a Catholic minister, are permitted to participate and to receive Holy Communion in an Assyrian celebration of the Holy Eucharist&quot;.

=== Oriental Orthodox churches ===

The Oriental Orthodox Churches have a similar understanding of communion as the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church. There is no leader of all the Oriental Orthodox Churches. All churches within the Oriental Orthodox Churches are autocephalous and operate and function on their own. All Oriental Orthodox Churches are in full communion with each other. They can take part in all the 7 sacraments from each other&#x27;s churches.

The Oriental Orthodox churches are:

*Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria
*Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch
*Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church
*Armenian Apostolic Church
*Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church
*Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church

The Oriental Orthodox Churches have a relationship with the Roman Catholic Church, and is working on a relationship with the Eastern Orthodox Church and other Christian Churches.

The Oriental Orthodox Churches believe in apostolic succession, the concept that Jesus Christ gave spiritual authority to the 12 Apostles and 72 Disciples, and that authority has been passed on till this day.

For example, the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch is considered the successor of St. Peter, the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria is considered the successor of St. Mark, the Armenian Apostolic Catholicos of Armenia is considered the successor of St. Bartholomew and St. Thaddeus, the Catholicos of the East of India is considered the successor of St. Thomas.

Likewise, the Oriental Orthodox Churches acknowledges the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople as the successor of St. Andrew and the Roman Catholic Pope as the successor of St. Peter and St. Paul. Due to the schisms at the Council of Chalcedon, the tensions between the churches have been high, but in recent years the leaders of all churches have acknowledged each other, and are working on a relationship with each other.

=== Anglican Communion ===

The Anglican Communion distinguishes between full communion and intercommunion. It applies the first term to situations &quot;where between two Churches, not of the same denominational or confessional family, there is unrestricted &quot;communio in sacris&quot; including mutual recognition and acceptance of ministries&quot;, and the second term to situations &quot;where varying degrees of relation other than full communion are established by agreement between two such Churches&quot;. This distinction differs from the distinction that the Catholic Church makes between full and partial communion in that the Anglican concept of intercommunion implies a formal agreement entered into by the churches concerned. As with other Protestant traditions, the Anglican understanding of full communion differs from that of the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy, which consider that full communion between churches involves them becoming a single church, as in the case of the particular churches &quot;in which and formed out of which the one and unique Catholic Church exists&quot;.

All the churches of the Anglican Communion are in full communion with the Mar Thoma Syrian Church, which is an Oriental Protestant denomination based in India. In addition the Anglican Communion recognizes the possibility of full communion between some of its member provinces or churches and other churches, without having the entire Anglican Communion share that relationship. An example is the Porvoo Communion, which is largely composed of Evangelical Lutheran Churches.

The Anglican Communion established full communion with the Old Catholic Churches on the basis of the 1931 Bonn Agreement, which established three principles:
# Each communion recognizes the catholicity and independence of the other and maintains its own.
# Each communion agrees to admit members of the other communion to participate in the sacraments.
# Full communion does not require from either communion the acceptance of all doctrinal opinion, sacramental devotion or liturgical practice characteristic of the other, but implies that each believes the other to hold all the essentials of the Christian faith.

The Anglicans Online website provides a list of non-Anglican churches &quot;in full communion with the See of Canterbury&quot; and also indicates some important ecumenical agreements of local character (i.e., not involving the whole of the Anglican Communion) with other non-Anglican churches. It also lists churches that, in spite of bearing names (such as &quot;Anglican&quot; or &quot;Episcopal&quot;) that might suggest a relationship with the Anglican Communion, are not in communion with it.

===Lutheran Churches===
===Reformed Churches===

The United Church of Christ (UCC) defines full communion as meaning that &quot;divided churches recognize each others&#x27; sacraments and provide for the orderly transfer of ministers from one denomination to another.&quot; Some of these go back to the 17th century Pilgrims in Holland; other relationships are recent. The UCC is in full communion alliance with the members of the World Communion of Reformed Churches, the Union of Evangelical Churches in Germany, the Presbyterian Church in the US, and several others in North America and elsewhere.

===Other churches===

Churches or denominations holding to open communion allow all persons who consider themselves &quot;Christian believers&quot; to participate, even without any arrangement of full communion with the other church or denomination involved, and still less requiring an arrangement involving interchangeability of ordained ministers.

It is in the stronger sense of becoming a single church that in 2007 the Traditional Anglican Communion sought &quot;full communion&quot; with the Roman Catholic Church as a &quot;sui iuris&quot; (particular Church) jurisdiction, but in 2012 declined the possibility offered by Pope Benedict XVI to join a personal ordinariate for former Anglicans in full communion with the see of Rome.

== Agreements between churches ==

The following groupings of churches have arrangements for or are working on arrangements for:
* mutual recognition of members
* joint celebration of the Lord&#x27;s Supper/Holy Communion/Eucharist (these churches practice open communion)
* mutual recognition of ordained ministers
* mutual recognition of sacraments
* a common commitment to mission.

He has three older siblings, Scott, Elizabeth, and Valerie. His family is Jewish and descends from Russian Jewish immigrants on both sides. Sandler grew up in Manchester, New Hampshire, after his family moved there when he was six years old. He attended Manchester Central High School. As a teen, Sandler was in BBYO, a Jewish youth group. He graduated from New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts in 1988 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in acting.

==Career==
===1987–1994: Early television and film roles===

In 1987, Sandler played Theo Huxtable&#x27;s friend Smitty on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and the Stud Boy or Trivia Delinquent on the MTV game show &quot;Remote Control&quot;. After his film debut in &quot;Going Overboard&quot; in 1989, Sandler performed in comedy clubs, having first taken the stage at his brother&#x27;s urging when he was 17. He was discovered by comedian Dennis Miller, who caught Sandler&#x27;s act in Los Angeles and recommended him to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; producer Lorne Michaels. Sandler was hired as a writer for &quot;SNL&quot; in 1990, and became a featured player the following year. He made a name for himself by performing amusing original songs on the show, including &quot;The Thanksgiving Song&quot; and &quot;The Chanukah Song&quot;. Sandler told Conan O&#x27;Brien on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; that NBC fired him and Chris Farley from the show in 1995. Sandler used his firing as part of his monologue when he returned in 2019 to host the show.

In 1993, Adam Sandler appeared in the film &quot;Coneheads&quot; with fellow SNL performers Farley, David Spade, Dan Aykroyd, Phil Hartman, and Jane Curtin. In 1994, he co-starred in &quot;Airheads&quot; with Brendan Fraser and Steve Buscemi.

===1995–2014: Commercial success ===

Sandler starred in &quot;Billy Madison&quot; (1995) playing a grown man repeating grades 1–12 to earn back his father&#x27;s respect and the right to inherit his father&#x27;s multimillion-dollar hotel empire. The film was successful at the box office despite negative reviews. He followed this film with &quot;Bulletproof&quot; (1996), and the financially successful comedies &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot; (1998), his first collaboration with Drew Barrymore. He was initially cast in the bachelor party-themed comedy/thriller &quot;Very Bad Things&quot; (1998) but had to back out due to his involvement in &quot;The Waterboy&quot; (1998), one of his first big hits.

Sandler continued making successful comedy films including &quot;Big Daddy&quot; (1999), &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; (2002), &quot;Anger Management&quot; (2003), &quot;50 First Dates&quot; (2004, his second collaboration with Drew Barrymore), &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; (2005), and &quot;Click&quot; (2006). He also formed his film production company, Happy Madison Productions, in 1999, first producing fellow &quot;SNL&quot; alumnus Rob Schneider&#x27;s film &quot;Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo&quot;. The company has produced most of Sandler&#x27;s subsequent films to date, and is on the Sony/Columbia Pictures lot in Culver City, California. Most of its films have received negative reviews from critics, with three considered among the worst ever made yet most have performed well at the box office.

Although his earlier commercially successful films did not receive favorable critical attention, Sandler started to receive more positive reviews beginning with his more dramatic role in &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; in 2002. &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; writer and director, Paul Thomas Anderson, had an &quot;obsession-level&quot; love for Sandler&#x27;s previous movies and wrote the film with him in mind. Sandler was intimidated to work with Anderson upon viewing his previous film &quot;Magnolia&quot; (2000), but these fears were alleviated upon receiving the script from Anderson. Roger Ebert&#x27;s review of &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; concluded that Sandler had been wasted in earlier films with poorly written scripts and characters with no development. Ebert noted that Sandler&#x27;s character still maintained the &quot;childlike, love-starved&quot; persona from his previous films, but was shown in a new light as the &quot;key to all Adam Sandler films&quot;. Sandler was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his performance. The film marked the beginning of Sandler moving outside the genre of slapstick comedy to take on more serious roles, such as Mike Binder&#x27;s &quot;Reign Over Me&quot; (2007), a drama about a man who loses his entire family in the September 11 attacks and then struggles to rekindle a friendship with his old college roommate (Don Cheadle).

Sandler starred alongside friend Kevin James in the film &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry&quot; (2007), and headlined &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess with the Zohan&quot; (2008). The latter was written by Sandler, Judd Apatow, and Robert Smigel, and directed by Dennis Dugan. That same year, Sandler starred along with Keri Russell and English comedian Russell Brand in Adam Shankman&#x27;s children&#x27;s fantasy film &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; (2008), as a stressed hotel maintenance worker whose bedtime stories he reads to his niece and nephew begin to come true. It marked Sandler&#x27;s first family film and first film under the Disney banner.

In 2009, Sandler starred in Apatow&#x27;s third directorial feature, &quot;Funny People&quot;, a comedy drama about a famous comedian (Sandler) with a terminal illness. The film was released on July 31, 2009. After its release, &quot;Funny People&quot; and &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; were cited in the June 2010 announcement that Sandler was one of 135 people (including 20 actors) invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
In 2010, Sandler appeared in &quot;Grown Ups&quot;, alongside Kevin James, Chris Rock, Rob Schneider, David Spade, Salma Hayek, Maria Bello, and Maya Rudolph. Sandler and &quot;Dickie Roberts&quot; scribe Fred Wolf wrote the script and Dennis Dugan directed. Sandler&#x27;s later comedy films, including &quot;Grown Ups&quot; and &quot;Grown Ups 2&quot;, received largely negative reviews. Reviewing the latter, critic Mark Olsen of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; remarked that Sandler had become the antithesis of Judd Apatow; he was instead &quot;the white Tyler Perry: smart enough to know better, savvy enough to do it anyway, lazy enough not to care.&quot; The next year, Sandler starred with Jennifer Aniston in the romantic comedy film &quot;Just Go with It&quot;. He also voiced a capuchin monkey in Kevin James&#x27;s &quot;Zookeeper&quot;, released on July 8, 2011. In 2012, he starred in &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot;, as a man who fathered a son (Andy Samberg) with his teacher (Eva Amurri) in high school. In 2013, he guest starred in the Disney Channel Original Series &quot;Jessie&quot; as himself in the episode &quot;Punched Dumped Love&quot;. He and &quot;Jessie&quot; star Cameron Boyce had worked together in &quot;Grown Ups&quot; and &quot;Grown Ups 2&quot;; Sandler&#x27;s 2020 film &quot;Hubie Halloween&quot; was dedicated to Boyce&#x27;s memory. Sandler next reunited with Drew Barrymore for a third time in the Warner Bros. romantic comedy &quot;Blended&quot;, which was filmed in South Africa and released on May 23, 2014.

=== 2014-present: Final theatrical films and switch to Netflix ===

In October 2014, Netflix announced a four-movie deal with Sandler and Happy Madison Productions. Also that year, Sandler co-starred in the drama film &quot;Men, Women &amp; Children&quot;, directed by Jason Reitman.

The film premiered in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival where his performance received favorable notices from critics. Peter Debruge, film critic for &quot;Variety&quot;, wrote of his performance, &quot;With no shtick to fall back on, Sandler is forced to act, and it&#x27;s a glorious thing to watch&quot;.

In 2018, Sandler starred in the Netflix film &quot;The Week Of&quot; alongside Chris Rock. He also starred in a Netflix stand-up special &quot;Adam Sandler: 100% Fresh&quot;, which was part of his company&#x27;s Netflix deal and marked his first stand-up film in over two decades. The special was directed by longtime collaborator Steven Brill, while portions of the special was filmed by Paul Thomas Anderson, which marked his first project with Sandler since &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; sixteen years prior.

On May 4, 2019, Sandler made his first appearance as host of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, ending the episode with a tribute to his friend and fellow former cast member Chris Farley. Sandler received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series nomination for his hosting stint. In June 2019, he reunited with Jennifer Aniston in the Netflix film &quot;Murder Mystery&quot;, which broke the record for the biggest opening weekend in the company&#x27;s history, and spawned a sequel, &quot;Murder Mystery 2&quot;, in 2023.

<text>Don Novello (born January 1, 1943) is an American actor, comedian, writer, singer, film director and producer.

He appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as the character Father Guido Sarducci from 1978 to 1980, and 1985 to 1986. He appeared as Sarducci in television shows &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Blossom&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;, &quot;Unhappily Ever After&quot;, &quot;Square Pegs&quot;, and &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, and in the 1980 film &quot;Gilda Live&quot;. He is the voice of Vincenzo &quot;Vinny&quot; Santorini in the franchise of &quot;&quot;.

==Early life==
Novello was born on January 1, 1943, in Ashtabula, Ohio, the son of Eleanor Eileen Novello (née Finnerty), a nurse, and Augustine Joseph Novello, a physician. He is of Italian and Irish descent.

Novello&#x27;s family moved to Lorain, Ohio, when he was a child. In 1961, he graduated from Lorain High School. He subsequently enrolled into the University of Dayton and graduated from it in 1964. In 1965, he graduated with a Bachelor of Foreign Trade degree from the American Graduate School of International Management (today the Thunderbird School of Global Management of Arizona State University).

==Career==
In the late 1960s, Novello worked as an advertising copywriter for Leo Burnett in Chicago.

Novello created the Father Guido Sarducci character in 1973 after finding a monsignor&#x27;s outfit for $7.50 at a St. Vincent de Paul thrift shop. Adding sunglasses, a broom mustache, cigarette and a thick Italian accent, Sarducci became popular in a San Francisco nightclub. Sarducci appeared on San Francisco Channel 20&#x27;s &quot;Chicken Little Comedy Show&quot;, and comic David Steinberg was watching. Steinberg hired Novello as a writer for a TV show that never aired, but he also introduced Novello to Tommy and Dick Smothers, and they hired Novello, too. Novello performed on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Show&quot; in 1975, appearing as Sarducci. He also was with Pat Paulsen during Paulsen&#x27;s &quot;Presidential Campaign Tour&quot; in the mid-70s as his &quot;Campaign Manager.&quot;

In the 1970s, Novello started to write letters to famous people under the pen name of Lazlo Toth (after Laszlo Toth, a deranged man who vandalized Michelangelo&#x27;s Pietà in Rome). The letters, written to suggest a serious but misinformed and obtuse correspondent, were designed to tweak the noses of politicians and corporations. Many of them received serious responses; Novello sometimes continued the charade correspondence at length, with humorous results. The letters and responses were published in the books &quot;The Lazlo Letters&quot;, &quot;Citizen Lazlo!&quot;, and &quot;From Bush to Bush: The Lazlo Toth Letters&quot;.

&quot;The Lazlo Letters&quot;, Novello&#x27;s first book of stilted letters to celebrities, caught the attention of Lorne Michaels, producer of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Novello was hired as a writer for the show&#x27;s third season in 1977–1978 where he remained through the fifth season, and returned as a writer in the eleventh season. He also appeared numerous times on the show in the Father Guido Sarducci character.

In 1980, under the name of Father Guido Sarducci, he sang lead vocals on the Warner Bros. Records release &quot;I Won&#x27;t Be Twisting This Christmas&quot;/&quot;Parco MacArthur&quot; (WBS49627). Novello co-wrote the first tune with M. Davich, and the second tune is an Italian language cover of &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;, the Jimmy Webb song, in an arrangement similar to that recorded by Richard Harris.

Novello made newspapers around the world when he visited the Vatican in 1981 wearing the Father Guido Sarducci costume and, while taking photographs for a magazine article in an area where photography was prohibited, was arrested by the Swiss Guards along with his photographer (Paul Solomon), and eventually charged with &quot;impersonating a priest&quot;. The charges were later dropped, and Solomon managed to protect the film from confiscation.

In his stage show in Las Vegas and Reno with the Smothers Brothers, Sarducci rolled a wheelchair with a dummy in the robes of a cardinal. In the act, Sarducci explained he was the assistant of 108-year-old &quot;Cardinal Dario Fungi.&quot;

For a brief period in 1982, Novello was a producer on &quot;SCTV&quot;, a Toronto-based comedy show starring Martin Short, Joe Flaherty, John Candy, Eugene Levy, Dave Thomas, Rick Moranis, Andrea Martin and Catherine O&#x27;Hara. He was installed by NBC as one of a series of producers for the show&#x27;s fourth season, and produced a total of nine episodes.

In 1983, Novello had a cameo as Father Sarducci in the video for Rodney Dangerfield&#x27;s comedy rap song &quot;Rappin&#x27; Rodney&quot; which was heavily played on MTV.

In 1984 Novello wrote &quot;The Blade&quot;, a high school yearbook parody in which the students are represented by sheep. Novello co-wrote the unfilmed script for &quot;Noble Rot&quot; with John Belushi. He also narrated Faerie Tale Theatre&#x27;s third-season episode &quot;Pinocchio&quot; with Paul Reubens as the titular puppet. Also in 1984, Novello appeared in the music video for the Jefferson Starship song &quot;No Way Out&quot;.

In 1989, Novello co-starred in the anthology film &quot;New York Stories&quot; in the Francis Ford Coppola-directed segment, &quot;Life Without Zoe&quot;. In his 2 1/2 star review of the film, Roger Ebert cited Novello for giving &quot;the most engaging performance in the movie.&quot;

In 1990, Novello portrayed &quot;Dominic Abbandando&quot; in the film &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;. Abbandando appears with speaking lines in the first scene as public relations and media coordinator for Don Michael Corleone. Most notable is when he slaps down a news reporter with the challenge: &quot;You think you know better than the Pope?&quot; Novello appears in many other scenes as well, shadowing George Hamilton, and in the climactic scene on the steps of the Palermo opera house, Teatro Massimo.

In the early 2000s, Novello voiced Vinny Santorini in the Disney film &quot;&quot; and its direct-to-video sequel, &quot;&quot;. In 2003, he filed papers to enter the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election, but did not collect enough valid signatures to qualify for the ballot.

In 2005, after the death of Pope John Paul II, Novello, as Father Guido Sarducci, reprised his former &quot;SNL&quot; role as &quot;Special Vatican Reporter&quot; for Air America Radio host (and fellow &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumnus) Al Franken. He continued this role until the election of Pope Benedict XVI. In 2006, he portrayed the role of Galileo on the podcast &quot;The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd&quot;.

He portrayed Pope Pius XII in the 2009 short film &quot;All in the Bunker&quot;.

On June 23, 2010, he appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; as Father Guido Sarducci.

On October 30, 2010, he gave the benediction at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear hosted by Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert.

American recording artist Guthrie Thomas credited Don Novello as &quot;the best performer in the room&quot; when he appeared as Father Guido Sarducci on one of Thomas&#x27; albums in a recording studio full of famous performers.

==Personal life==
Novello resides in San Anselmo, California. He has one brother, Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Novello, and one sister, Eileen. His former sister-in-law, Antonia Novello, was Surgeon General of the United States from 1990 to 1993. His niece is film producer Holly Wiersma (&quot;Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Billionaire Boys Club&quot;).

<doc id="102695" wikidata="Q422665" url="?curid=102695" title="Trimethoprim">
<text>Trimethoprim (TMP) is an antibiotic used mainly in the treatment of bladder infections. Other uses include for middle ear infections and travelers&#x27; diarrhea. With sulfamethoxazole or dapsone it may be used for &quot;Pneumocystis&quot; pneumonia in people with HIV/AIDS. It is taken orally (swallowed by mouth).
Common side effects include nausea, changes in taste, and rash. Rarely it may result in blood problems such as not enough platelets or white blood cells. Trimethoprim may cause sun sensitivity. There is evidence of potential harm during pregnancy in some animals but not humans. It works by blocking folate metabolism via dihydrofolate reductase in some bacteria, preventing creation of bacterial DNA and RNA and leading to bacterial cell death.
Trimethoprim was first used in 1962. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==
It is primarily used in the treatment of urinary tract infections, although it may be used against any susceptible aerobic bacterial species. It may also be used to treat and prevent &quot;Pneumocystis jirovecii&quot; pneumonia. It is generally not recommended for the treatment of anaerobic infections such as &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; colitis (the leading cause of antibiotic-induced diarrhea). Trimethoprim has been used in trials to treat retinitis.

Resistance to trimethoprim is increasing, but it is still a first-line antibiotic in many countries.

===Spectrum of susceptibility===
Cultures and susceptibility tests should be done to make sure bacteria are treated by trimethoprim.
* &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;
* &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot;
* &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;
* &quot;Enterobacter&quot; species
* Coagulase-negative &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; species, including &quot;S. saprophyticus&quot;
* &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;
* &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;

==Side effects==

=== Common ===
* Nauseas
* Change in taste
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Rashes
* Sun sensitivity
* Itchiness

=== Rare ===
* Can cause thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets) by lowering folic acid levels; this may also cause megaloblastic anemia.
* Trimethoprim antagonizes the epithelial sodium channel in the distal tubule, thus acting like amiloride. This can cause increased potassium levels in the body (hyperkalemia).
* Can compete with creatinine for secretion into the renal tubule. This can cause an artificial rise in the serum creatinine.
* Use in EHEC infections may lead to an increase in expression of Shiga toxin.

=== Contraindications ===
* Known hypersensitivity to trimethoprim
* History of megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency

It may be involved in a reaction similar to disulfiram when alcohol is consumed after it is used, in particular when used in combination with sulfamethoxazole.

=== Pregnancy ===
Based on the studies that show that trimethoprim crosses the placenta and can affect folate metabolism, there has been growing evidence of the risk of structural birth defects associated with trimethoprim, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy.

The trophoblasts in the early fetus are sensitive to changes in the folate cycle. A 2013 study found a doubling in the risk of miscarriage in women exposed to trimethoprim in the early pregnancy.

==Mechanism of action==

Trimethoprim binds to dihydrofolate reductase and inhibits the reduction of dihydrofolic acid (DHF) to tetrahydrofolic acid (THF). THF is an essential precursor in the thymidine synthesis pathway and interference with this pathway inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis. Trimethoprim&#x27;s inhibitory activity for bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is sixty thousand times greater than for human dihydrofolate reductase. Sulfamethoxazole inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, an enzyme involved further upstream in the same pathway. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are commonly used in combination due to possible synergistic effects, and reduced development of resistance. This benefit has been questioned.
==History==
Trimethoprim was first used in 1962. In 1972, it was used as a prophylactic treatment for urinary tract infections in Finland.

Its name is derived from &quot;trimeth&quot;yl&quot;o&quot;xy-&quot;p&quot;y&quot;rim&quot;idine.

<text>The Dalí Theatre and Museum (, ; ) is a museum dedicated to the artist Salvador Dalí in his home town of Figueres, in Catalonia, Spain. Salvador Dalí lived there from 1984 to 1989, and is buried in a crypt below the stage. The museum received 1,368,755 visitors in 2016.

== Museum ==
The heart of the museum is the town&#x27;s theatre that Dalí knew as a child. It was where one of the first public exhibitions of young Dalí&#x27;s art was shown. The old theatre was burned during the Spanish Civil War and remained in a state of ruin. In 1960, Dalí and the mayor of Figueres decided to rebuild it as a museum dedicated to the town&#x27;s most famous son. In 1968, the city council approved the plan, and construction began the following year. The architects were Joaquim de Ros i Ramis and Alexandre Bonaterra. The museum opened on September 28, 1974, and it expanded through the mid-1980s. The museum now includes buildings and courtyards adjacent to the old theatre.

The museum displays the single largest and most diverse collection of works by Salvador Dalí, the core of which was from the artist&#x27;s personal collection. In addition to Dalí paintings from all decades of his career, there are Dalí sculptures, three-dimensional collages, mechanical devices, and other curiosities from Dalí&#x27;s imagination. A highlight is a three-dimensional anamorphic living-room installation with a &quot;Mae West Lips Sofa&quot;, a custom sofa that looks like the face of Mae West when viewed from a certain spot.

The museum also houses a small selection of works by other artists collected by Dalí, ranging from El Greco and Bougereau to Marcel Duchamp and John de Andrea, In accordance with Dalí&#x27;s specific request, a second-floor gallery is devoted to the work of his friend and fellow Catalan artist Antoni Pitxot, who also became director of the museum after Dalí&#x27;s death.

A glass geodesic dome cupola crowns the stage of the old theatre, and Dalí is buried in a crypt below the stage floor. The space formerly occupied by the audience has been transformed into a courtyard open to the sky, with Dionysian nude figurines standing in the old balcony windows. A Dalí installation inside a full-sized car, inspired by &quot;Rainy Taxi&quot; (1938), is parked near the centre of the space.

== Art collection ==
The Dalí Theatre and Museum holds the largest collection of major works by Dalí in a single location. Some of the most important exhibited works are &quot;Port Alguer&quot; (1924), &quot;The Spectre of Sex-appeal&quot; (1932), &quot;Soft self-portrait with grilled bacon&quot; (1941), &quot;Poetry of America—the Cosmic Athletes&quot; (1943), &quot;Galarina&quot; (1944–45), &quot;Basket of Bread&quot; (1945), &quot;Leda Atomica&quot; (1949), &quot;Galatea of the Spheres&quot; (1952), &quot;Crist de la Tramuntana&quot; (1968), and &quot;Dalí Seen from the Back Painting Gala from the Back Eternalised by Six Virtual Corneas Provisionally Reflected by Six Real Mirrors&quot; (1972-73).

There is also a set of works created by the artist expressly for the Museum, including the &quot;Mae West&quot; room, the &quot;Palace of the Wind&quot; room, the &quot;Monument to Francesc Pujols&quot;, and the &quot;Cadillac plujós&quot;.

A collection of holographic art by Dalí, and a collection of jewellery he designed are on display. Another room contains a bathtub and a side table with an open drawer and a lamp, all of which Dalí had installed upside-down on the ceiling.

An extension to the museum building contains a room dedicated to optical illusions, stereographs, and anamorphic art created by Dalí. The artist&#x27;s final works, including his last oil painting, &quot;The Swallow&#x27;s Tail&quot; (1983), are on display here.

<doc id="102698" wikidata="Q388063" url="?curid=102698" title="Bob Zmuda">
<text>Bob Zmuda (born December 12, 1949) is an American writer, comedian, producer, and director best known for his collaboration with comedian and performance artist Andy Kaufman.

==Biography==
Zmuda occasionally portrayed Kaufman&#x27;s Tony Clifton character on stage and for television appearances. In a 2006 interview, Zmuda told the &quot;Opie and Anthony Show&quot; that he was masquerading as Tony Clifton with David Letterman, and that Letterman did not find out until years later.
In 1986, Zmuda founded the American version of &quot;Comic Relief&quot;, an annual event that raises money to help the homeless in the United States. The event was televised on HBO, and was hosted by comedians Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg.

In 1999, Zmuda wrote a book about Kaufman&#x27;s life, titled &quot;Andy Kaufman Revealed!&quot;, which purported to unveil many tricks and hoaxes that the two pulled off in front of audiences and television cameras in the 1980s. One critic praised the book as &quot;the ultimate insider&#x27;s look at Kaufman&#x27;s life&quot;, while some of Kaufman&#x27;s fans and members of Kaufman&#x27;s family criticized it for inaccuracies about Kaufman.

Later that year, Miloš Forman directed &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, the story of Kaufman&#x27;s life. Zmuda created the &quot;Tony Clifton&quot; makeup for the film, and made a brief appearance portraying comedian Jack Burns, one of the producers, who gets into a brawl on stage during one of Kaufman&#x27;s appearances on the 1980–82 ABC late night comedy show, &quot;Fridays&quot;. Zmuda was also &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;″s co-executive producer. On camera, the character of Bob Zmuda was played by Paul Giamatti. Stanley Kaufman, Andy&#x27;s father, criticized Zmuda&#x27;s influence on the film shortly after its release, writing in the form of Andy speaking from beyond the grave.

Sam Simon, executive producer on &quot;Taxi&quot;, revealed in a 2013 interview with Marc Maron for the WTF Podcast that the portrayal of Andy on the show was &quot;a complete fiction&quot; largely created by Bob Zmuda, who he maintained has a &quot;vested interest&quot; in creating stories about Kaufman. In the interview Simon stated that Kaufman was &quot;completely professional&quot; and that he &quot;told you Tony Clifton was he&quot;, but conceded that Kaufman would have &quot;loved&quot; Zmuda&#x27;s version of events.

In 2014, Zmuda co-authored another book with new anecdotes about Kaufman&#x27;s desire to fake his death entitled &quot;Andy Kaufman: The Truth, Finally&quot;, which states that Kaufman&#x27;s death was indeed a prank. Zmuda says that Kaufman is still alive and that Kaufman would soon be revealing himself as his upper limit on the prank was thirty years. Zmuda now states that Kaufman offered to leave him money since Zmuda&#x27;s career was largely dependent on Kaufman performing but he turned it down because he believed it would implicate him in a crime. The terms of the book deal were not disclosed.

On November 7, 2014, Bob Zmuda appeared as a guest on Greg Fitzsimmons&#x27; podcast, &quot;Fitzdog Radio&quot;. During the interview, Zmuda claimed to have invested $50,000 in the new book. He stormed off the podcast after Fitzsimmons doubted Zmuda&#x27;s intentions regarding claims of Kaufman&#x27;s staged death.

On November 16, 2014, a post on the Tony Clifton Facebook page claimed that Zmuda had died at the Moonlite BunnyRanch, sourcing the information to a UPI article. The same day, the BunnyRanch tweeted that they had been asked by Zmuda&#x27;s management not to comment, with a link to the hoax Facebook story.

Two days later, comedy news website The Interrobang posted a story with photos, verifying that Zmuda was not dead. Later that day, UPI posted a story, confirming the hoax.

<doc id="102718" wikidata="Q304176" url="?curid=102718" title="Aluminium gallium arsenide">
<text>Aluminium gallium arsenide (also gallium aluminium arsenide) (AlxGa1−xAs) is a semiconductor material with very nearly the same lattice constant as GaAs, but a larger bandgap. The &quot;x&quot; in the formula above is a number between 0 and 1 - this indicates an arbitrary alloy between GaAs and AlAs.

The chemical formula &quot;AlGaAs&quot; should be considered an abbreviated form of the above, rather than any particular ratio.

The bandgap varies between 1.42 eV (GaAs) and 2.16 eV (AlAs). For x &lt; 0.4, the bandgap is direct.

The refractive index is related with the bandgap via the Kramers–Kronig relations and varies between 2.9 (x = 1) and 3.5 (x = 0). This allows the construction of Bragg mirrors used in VCSELs, RCLEDs, and substrate-transferred crystalline coatings.

Aluminium gallium arsenide is used as a barrier material in GaAs based heterostructure devices. The AlGaAs layer confines the electrons to a gallium arsenide region. An example of such a device is a quantum well infrared photodetector (QWIP).

It is commonly used in GaAs-based red- and near-infra-red-emitting (700–1100 nm) double-hetero-structure laser diodes.

==Safety and toxicity aspects==
The toxicology of AlGaAs has not been fully investigated. The dust is an irritant to skin, eyes and lungs. The environment, health and safety aspects of aluminium gallium arsenide sources (such as trimethylgallium and arsine) and industrial hygiene monitoring studies of standard MOVPE sources have been reported recently in a review.

Dubbed the most Roman city outside Italy, Nîmes has a rich history dating back to the Roman Empire when the city had a population of 50,000–60,000 and was the regional capital. Several famous monuments are in Nîmes, such as the Arena of Nîmes and the Maison Carrée. Because of this, Nîmes is often referred to as the &quot;French Rome&quot;.

Nimes is situated where the alluvial plain of the Vistrenque River abuts the hills of Mont Duplan to the northeast, Montaury to the southwest, and to the west Mt. Cavalier and the knoll of Canteduc.

Its name appears in inscriptions in Gaulish as &quot;dede matrebo Namausikabo&quot; (&quot;he has given to the mothers of Nîmes&quot;) and &quot;toutios Namausatis&quot; (&quot;citizen of Nîmes&quot;).

Nemausus was the god of the local Volcae Arecomici tribe.

==History==
===4000–2000 BCE===
The Neolithic site of Serre Paradis reveals the presence of semi-nomadic cultivators in the period 4000 to 3500 BCE on the site of Nîmes.

The menhir of Courbessac (or La Poudrière) stands in a field, near the aerodrome. This limestone monolith of over two metres in height dates to about 2500 BCE, and is considered the oldest monument of Nîmes.

===1800–600 BCE===
The Bronze Age has left traces of villages that were made out of huts and branches. The population of the site increased during the Bronze Age.

===600–121 BCE===

The hill of Mt. Cavalier was the site of the early oppidum which gave birth to the city. During the third and 2nd centuries BCE a surrounding wall was built with a dry-stone tower at the summit which was later incorporated into the Tour Magne. 

Strabo, the Greek geographer, mentioned that this town functioned as the regional capital for the Volcae Arecomici, a Celtic people. The city adopted the name of a local water deity, Nemausus. The town had a healing spring.

The Warrior of Grezan is considered to be the most ancient indigenous sculpture in southern Gaul.

In 123 BCE the Roman general Quintus Fabius Maximus campaigned against Gallic tribes in the area and defeated the Allobroges and the Arverni, while the Volcae offered no resistance. The Roman province Gallia Transalpina was established in 121 BCE and from 118 BCE the Via Domitia was built through the later site of the city.

===Roman period===
The city arose on the important Via Domitia which connected Italy with Hispania.

Nîmes became a Roman colony as &quot;Colonia Nemausus&quot; sometime before 28 BCE, as witnessed by the earliest coins, which bear the abbreviation , &quot;Colony of Nemausus&quot;. Veterans of Julius Caesar&#x27;s legions in his Nile campaigns were given plots of land to cultivate on the plain of Nîmes.

Augustus started a major building program in the city, as elsewhere in the empire. He also gave the town a ring of ramparts 6 km () long, reinforced by 14 towers; two gates remain today: the Porte d&#x27;Auguste and the Porte de France. Internally, the city was organized around the cardo and decumanus, intersecting at the forum. The Maison Carrée, an exceptionally well-preserved temple dating from the late 1st century BCE, stands as one of the finest surviving examples of Roman temple architecture. Dedicated to Roma and Augustus, it bears striking resemblance to Rome&#x27;s Temple of Portunus, blending Etruscan and Greek design influences.

The great Nimes Aqueduct, many of whose remains can be seen today outside of the city, was built to bring water from the hills to the north. Where it crossed the river Gard between Uzès and Remoulins, the spectacular Pont du Gard was built. This is north east of the city.

The museum contains many fine objects including mosaic floors, frescoes and sculpture from rich houses and buildings found in excavations in and near the city. It is known that the town had a civil basilica, a curia, a gymnasium and perhaps a circus. The amphitheatre is very well preserved, dates from the end of the 2nd century and was one of the largest amphitheatres in the Empire. The so-called Temple of Diana dating from Augustus and rebuilt in the 2nd century was not a temple but was centred on a nymphaeum located within the Fontaine Sanctuary dedicated to Augustus and may have been a library.

The city was the birthplace of the family of emperor Antoninus Pius (138-161).

Emperor Constantine (306-337) endowed the city with baths.

It became the seat of the Diocesan Vicar, the chief administrative officer of southern Gaul.

The town was prosperous until the end of the 3rd century when successive barbarian invasions slowed its development. During the 4th and 5th centuries, the nearby town of Arles enjoyed more prosperity. In the early 5th century the Praetorian Prefecture was moved from Trier in northeast Gaul to Arles.

The Visigoths captured the city in 472.

====4th–13th centuries====

When the Visigoths were accepted into the Roman Empire, Nîmes was included in their territory in 472, even after the Frankish victory at the Battle of Vouillé (507). The urban landscape went through transformation with the Goths, but much of the heritage of the Roman era remained largely intact.

By 725, the Muslim Umayyads had conquered the whole Visigothic territory of Septimania including Nîmes. In 736–737, Charles Martel and his brother led an expedition to Septimania and Provence, and largely destroyed the city (in the hands of Umayyads allied with the local Gallo-Roman and Gothic nobility), including the amphitheatre, thereafter heading back north. The Muslim government came to an end in 752, when Pepin the Short captured the city. In 754, an uprising took place against the Carolingian king, but was put down, and count Radulf, a Frank, appointed as master of the city. After the events connected with the war, Nîmes was now only a shadow of the opulent Roman city it had once been. The local authorities installed themselves in the remains of the amphitheatre. 
Islamic burials have been found in Nîmes.

Carolingian rule brought relative peace, but feudal times in the 12th century brought local troubles, which lasted until the days of St. Louis. During that period Nîmes was jointly administered by a bishop, as well as by a civil authority headquartered in the old amphitheater, where lived the Magistrate/ Viguier, as well as the Viguier&#x27;s retainers, the Knights of the Arena. Meanwhile the city was represented by four Consuls, whose offices were located in the old Maison Carrée.

Despite incessant feudal squabbling, Nîmes saw some progress both in commerce and industry as well as in stock-breeding and associated activities. After the last effort by Raymond VII of Toulouse, St. Louis managed to establish royal power in the region which became Languedoc. Nîmes thus finally came into the hands of the King of France.

===Period of invasions===

During the 14th and 15th centuries the Rhone Valley underwent an uninterrupted series of invasions which ruined the economy and caused famine. Customs were forgotten, religious troubles developed (&quot;see French Wars of Religion&quot;) and epidemics, all of which affected the city. Nîmes, which was one of the Protestant strongholds, felt the full force of repression and fratricidal confrontations (including the &quot;Michelade&quot; massacre) which continued until the middle of the 17th century, adding to the misery of periodic outbreaks of plague.

===17th century to the French Revolution===
In the middle of the 17th century Nîmes experienced a period of prosperity. Population growth caused the town to expand, and slum housing to be replaced. To this period also belong the reconstruction of Notre-Dame-Saint-Castor, the Bishop&#x27;s palace and numerous mansions (hôtels). This renaissance strengthened the manufacturing and industrial potential of the city, the population rising from 21,000 to 50,000 inhabitants.

In this same period the Fountain gardens, the &quot;Quais de la Fontaine&quot;, were laid out, the areas surrounding the Maison Carrée and the Amphitheatre were cleared of encroachments, whilst the entire population benefited from the atmosphere of prosperity.

===From the French Revolution to the present===
Following a European economic crisis that hit Nîmes with full force, the Revolutionary period awoke the slumbering demons of political and religious antagonism. The White Terror added to natural calamities and economic recession, produced murder, pillage and arson until 1815. Order was however restored in the course of the century, and Nîmes became the metropolis of Bas-Languedoc, diversifying its industry into new kinds of activity. At the same time the surrounding countryside adapted to market needs and shared in the general increase of wealth.

During the Second World War, the Maquis resistance fighters Jean Robert and Vinicio Faïta were executed at Nîmes on 22 April 1943. The Nîmes marshalling yards were bombed by American bombers in 1944.

The 2e Régiment Étranger d&#x27;Infanterie (2ºREI), the main motorised infantry regiment of the Foreign Legion, has been garrisoned in Nîmes since November 1983.

=== Archaeology ===
In April 2024, a collection of glassware dating back to the Roman period was discovered in Nîmes. The collection includes strigils, ornate glass vases, ceramics, a glass paste cup, lamps, and fragments of funerary monuments and amphorae.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Nîmes is one of the warmest cities in France. The city has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;), with summers being too wet for it to be classified as a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;). Its slightly inland, southerly location results in hot air over the city during summer months: temperatures above 34 °C are common in July and August, whereas winters are cool but not cold. Nighttime low temperatures below 0 °C are common from December to February, while snowfall occurs every year.

==Sights==

Several important remains of the Roman Empire can still be seen in and around Nîmes:

*The elliptical Roman amphitheatre, of the 1st or 2nd century AD, is the best-preserved Roman arena in France. It was filled with medieval housing, when its walls served as ramparts, but they were cleared under Napoleon. It is still used as a bull fighting and concert arena.
*The Maison Carrée (&quot;Square House&quot;), a small Roman temple dedicated to sons of Agrippa was built c. 19 BCE. It is one of the best-preserved Roman temples anywhere. Visitors can watch a short film about the history of Nîmes inside.
*The 18th-century &quot;Jardins de la Fontaine&quot; (Gardens of the Fountain) built around the Roman thermae ruins.
*The nearby Pont du Gard, also built by Agrippa, is a well-preserved aqueduct that used to carry water across the small Gardon river valley.
*The nearby Mont Cavalier is crowned by the &quot;Tour Magne&quot; (&quot;Great Tower&quot;), a ruined Roman tower.
*The castellum divisorium, a rare vestige of a Roman water inlet system.
*The Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1703.

Later monuments include:
*The cathedral (dedicated to Saint Castor of Apt, a native of the city), occupying, it is believed, the site of the temple of Augustus, is partly Romanesque and partly Gothic in style.
*The Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nîmes
*The Musée de la Romanité, a museum dedicated to Roman history, located outside the amphitheatre

Pieces of modern architecture can also be found : Norman Foster conceived the &quot;Carré d&#x27;art&quot; (1986), a museum of modern art and &quot;mediatheque&quot;, and Jean Nouvel designed the Nemausus, a post-modern residential ensemble.

== Economy ==
Nîmes is historically known for its textiles. Denim, the fabric of blue jeans, derives its name from this city (&quot;Serge de Nîmes&quot;). The blue dye was imported via Genoa from Lahore, the capital of the Great Mughal.

==Population==

The population of Nîmes in Roman times (50 AD) was estimated at 50–60,000, and it only reached that number again in the mid-19th century. The population of Nîmes increased from 128,471 in 1990 to 146,709 in 2012, yet the biggest growth the city ever experienced happened in 1968, with a growth of +23.5% compared to 1962.

==Culture==

From 1810 to 1822, Joseph Gergonne published in Nîmes a scientific journal specializing in mathematics called &quot;Annales de Gergonne&quot;.

The asteroid 51 Nemausa was named after Nîmes, where it was discovered in 1858.

Twice each year, Nîmes hosts one of the main French bullfighting events, Feria de Nîmes (festival), and several hundreds of thousands gather in the streets.

Metallica&#x27;s live DVD &quot;Français Pour une Nuit&quot; (English: French for One Night) was recorded in Nîmes, France, in the Arena of Nîmes on 7 July 2009, during the World Magnetic Tour.

==Transportation==
Nîmes-Alès-Camargue-Cévennes Airport serves the city, although its proximity with the much bigger Montpellier Airport has worked against its frequentation over the years. It is currently only served by Ryanair with an average of 3 flights per day, to destinations such as London, Fez, Dublin or Marrakech.

The motorway A9 connects Nîmes with Orange, Montpellier, Narbonne, and Perpignan, the A54 with Arles and Salon-de-Provence.

Nîmes station is the central railway station, offering connections to Paris (high-speed rail), Marseille, Montpellier, Narbonne, Toulouse, Perpignan, Figueres and Barcelona in Spain and several regional destinations. There is another station in the Saint-Césaire quarter, Saint-Césaire station, with connections to Le Grau-du-Roi, Montpellier and Avignon.

The new contournement Nîmes – Montpellier high-speed rail line opened to passenger service on 15 December 2019 together with a new TGV station at Nîmes-Pont-du-Gard station, located 12 km outside the city. The station is also located on the existing route between Nìmes and Avignon, thus providing connections between the new line and local rail service.

Nîmes bus station is adjacent to the city centre railway station. Buses connect the city with nearby towns and villages not served by rail.

==Sport==
The association football club Nîmes Olympique, currently playing in Championnat National, is based in Nîmes.

World Archery Indoor World Cup takes place in Nîmes each year in mid January.
