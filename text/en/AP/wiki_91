<text>The Real World (known as Real World from 2014 to 2017) is an American reality television series produced through MTV and Bunim/Murray Productions that most recently aired on Facebook Watch after airing on MTV from 1992 to 2017. It was originally produced by Mary-Ellis Bunim and Jonathan Murray. First broadcast in 1992, the show was inspired by the 1973 PBS documentary series &quot;An American Family&quot;. &quot;The Real World&quot; is one of the longest-running programs in MTV history, one of the longest-running reality series in history, and is credited with launching the modern reality TV genre. Seven to eight young adults are picked to temporarily live in a new city together in one residence while being filmed non-stop.

The series was hailed in its early years for depicting issues of contemporary young-adulthood relevant to its core audience, such as sex, prejudice, religion, abortion, illness, sexuality, AIDS, death, politics, and substance abuse, but later garnered a reputation as a showcase for immaturity and irresponsible behavior.
The series has generated two notable related series, both broadcast by MTV: &quot;Road Rules&quot;, a sister show, which lasted for 14 seasons (1995–2007), and the ongoing spin-off reality game show &quot;The Challenge&quot;, which has run for 40 seasons since 1998, thus surpassing &quot;The Real World&quot;.

On June 8, 2018, it was announced that MTV and Bunim/Murray were working on a revival of &quot;The Real World&quot;, with the hopes of selling the new version to a streaming platform. In 2018, it was announced that the revival had been sold to Facebook Watch for a new American season, plus a Mexican and a Thai version of the show. The thirty-third season was filmed in Atlanta, Georgia and premiered on June 13, 2019, along with the first new international localized versions since 1996: &quot;El Mundo Real&quot; in Mexico City and &quot;The Real World: Bangkok&quot;. A reboot of the original show for Paramount+ was mentioned in the press in 2021 but never materialized.

On March 4, 2021, the spin-off &quot;The Real World Homecoming: New York&quot; premiered on Paramount+. The series reunited the cast of &quot;The Real World: New York&quot; to live in the same loft they lived in for the original series. Two more reunion seasons followed. All three seasons were removed from the streaming service in 2023.

==History==

&quot;The Real World&quot; was inspired by the 1973 PBS documentary series &quot;An American Family&quot;. It focuses on the lives of a group of strangers who audition to live together in a house for several months, as cameras record their interpersonal relationships. The show moves to a different city each season. The footage shot during the housemates&#x27; time together was edited into 22-minute episodes for the first 19 seasons, and into 44-minute episodes beginning with &quot;The Real World: Hollywood&quot;, the series&#x27; twentieth season, before shortening to a 30-minute length for its thirty-third season. The narration given over the opening title sequence used during the first 28 seasons by the seven housemates states some variation of the following:

&quot;The Real World&quot; was originally inspired by the popularity of youth-oriented shows of the 1990s like &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. Bunim and Murray initially considered developing a scripted series in a similar vein, but quickly decided that the cost of paying writers, actors, costume designers, and make-up artists was too high. Bunim and Murray decided against this idea, and at the last minute, pulled the concept (and the cast) before it became the first season of the show. Tracy Grandstaff, one of the original seven picked for what has come to be known as &quot;Season 0&quot;, went on to minor fame as the voice of the animated &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; character Daria Morgendorffer, who eventually got her own spinoff, &quot;Daria&quot;. Dutch TV producer Erik Latour claims that the ideas for &quot;The Real World&quot; were directly derived from his television show &quot;Nummer 28&quot;, which aired in 1991 on Dutch television. Bunim/Murray decided upon the cheaper idea of casting a bunch of &quot;regular people&quot; to live in an apartment and taping their day-to-day lives, believing seven diverse people would have enough of a basis upon which to interact without scripts. The production converted a massive, 4000-square-foot duplex in Soho, cast seven cast members from 500 applicants, and paid them $2,600 for their time on the show. The cast lived in the loft from February 16 to May 18, 1992. The series premiered three days later, on May 21, 1992.

At the time of its initial airing, reviews of the show were mostly negative. Matt Roush, writing in &quot;USA Today&quot;, characterized the show as &quot;painfully bogus&quot;, and a cynical and exploitative new low in television, commenting, &quot;Watching The Real World, which fails as documentary (too phony) and as entertainment (too dull), it&#x27;s hard to tell who&#x27;s using who more.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Tom Shales commented, &quot;Ah to be young, cute, and stupid, and to have too much free time...Such is the lot facing the wayward wastrels of The Real World, something new in excruciating torture from the busy minds at MTV.&quot; Shales also remarked upon the cast members&#x27; creative career choices, saying, &quot;You might want to think about getting a real job.&quot;

Nonetheless, the series was a hit with viewers. One early sign of the show&#x27;s popularity occurred on the October 2, 1993 episode of the sketch comedy show, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, which parodied the second-season Los Angeles cast&#x27;s recurring arguments over cliquism, prejudice and political differences.

The show also gained widespread attention with its third season, &quot;The Real World: San Francisco&quot;, which aired in 1994, and depicted the conflict between David &quot;Puck&quot; Rainey, a bicycle messenger criticized for his poor personal hygiene, and his roommates, most notably AIDS activist Pedro Zamora. As the show increased in popularity, Zamora&#x27;s life as someone living with AIDS gained considerable notice, garnering widespread media attention. Zamora was one of the first openly gay men with AIDS to be portrayed in popular media, and after his death on November 11, 1994 (mere hours after the final episode of his season aired), he was lauded by then-President Bill Clinton. Zamora&#x27;s friend and roommate during the show, Judd Winick, went on to become a successful comic book writer, and wrote the Eisner Award-nominated graphic novel &quot;Pedro and Me&quot;, about his friendship with Zamora, as well as high-profile and controversial storylines in mainstream superhero comics that featured gay and AIDS-related themes. Zamora&#x27;s conflicts with Rainey were not only considered emotional high points for that season, but are credited with making &quot;The Real World&quot; a hit show, and with proving that the infant &quot;reality&quot; television format was one that could bring considerable ratings to a network. By July 1995, the series surpassed &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot; as the network&#x27;s top-rated show during the fourth season, &quot;The Real World: London&quot;.

==Cast member successes==
Appearing on the program has often served as a springboard to further success, especially in the entertainment industry.

Eric Nies of the New York cast went on to become a model, actor, and television host. His housemate, Kevin Powell, became a successful author, poet, journalist, and politician. Their housemate Heather B. Gardner went on to become a hip-hop music artist under the professional name Heather B.

Ex-Plosion cast member Cory Wharton went on to become a supporting cast member on Teen Mom OG with his girlfriend Cheyanne Floyd in 2018.

Dozens of former cast members from &quot;The Real World&quot; and its sister production &quot;Road Rules&quot; have appeared on the spin-off series &quot;The Challenge&quot;, which pays $100,000 or more to its winners. Various cast members have also earned livings as public speakers, since Bunim-Murray Productions funded their training in motivational speaking by the Points of Light Foundation in 2002, allowing them to earn between $1,500 and $2,000 for an appearance on the college lecture circuit.

==Residence and facilities==
The residence is typically elaborate in its décor, and for many seasons was furnished by IKEA. The residence usually includes a pool table, a Jacuzzi, and in many seasons an aquarium, which serves as a metaphor for the show, in that the roommates, who are being taped at all times in their home, are seen metaphorically as fish in a fishbowl. This point is punctuated not only by the fact that the MTV logo title card seen after the closing credits of each episode is designed as an aquarium, but also by a poem that Judd Winick wrote during his stay in the 1994 San Francisco house called &quot;Fishbowl&quot;. In some seasons, the group is provided with a shared car to use during their stay, or in the case of the St. Thomas season, a chauffeured motorboat to transport cast members from their Hassel Island residence to Charlotte Amalie. There is also a home phone and a computer provided for cast members to have contact with family and friends, as they are not allowed to use their mobile phones during their stay in the house.

==Format and structure==
Each season consists of seven to eight people (in initial seasons ages 18–26 before changing to 21–26 and currently cast for 21–34), usually selected from thousands of applicants from across the country, with the group chosen typically representing different races, sexes, sexual orientations, levels of sexual experience, and religious and political beliefs. Should a cast member decide to move out, or be asked to do so by all his or her roommates, the roommates will often get a replacement, dependent on how much filming time is left. Cast members are paid a small stipend for their participation in the show. The cast of the first season, for example, was given $2,500. This amount increased to $5,000 before taxes with the first New Orleans season in 2000, and included each cast member&#x27;s story rights in perpetuity. However, because cast members are not actors playing characters, they do not receive residuals that are routinely paid to actors when a TV show on which they appear is aired and replayed, and are not permitted to use the name of the series when promoting their own business ventures.

Each season begins with the individual members of the house shown leaving home, often for the first time, and/or meeting their fellow housemates while in transit to their new home, or at the house itself. The exception was the Los Angeles season, which premiered with two housemates picking up a third at his Kentucky home and driving in a Winnebago RV to their new home in Los Angeles.
The housemates are taped around the clock. The house is outfitted with video cameras mounted on walls to capture more intimate moments, and camera crews consisting of three to six people follow the cast around the house and out in public. In total, approximately 30 cameras are used during production. Each member of the cast is instructed to ignore the cameras and the crew, but are required to wear a battery pack and microphone in order to record their dialogue, though some castmembers have been known to turn off or hide them at times. The only area of the house in which camera access is restricted are the bathrooms.

Despite the initial awkwardness of being surrounded by cameramen, castmembers have stated that they eventually adjust to it, and that their behavior is purely natural, and not influenced by the fact that they are being taped. Winick, an alumnus of the show&#x27;s third season (San Francisco), adds that castmembers eventually stop thinking about the cameras because it is too exhausting not to, and that the fact that their lives were being documented made it seem &quot;more real&quot;. Other cast members have related different accounts. Members of the London cast found the cameras burdensome at times, such as Jay Frank and Jacinda Barrett, who felt they intruded on the intimacy of their romantic relationships. Lars Schlichting related an anecdote in which roommate Mike Johnson asked a question when cameras were not present, and then asked the same question five minutes later when cameras &quot;were&quot; present, which Schlichting adds was not typical of Johnson. Johnson himself has remarked that castmate Barrett &quot;hammed it up a lot,&quot; and that roommate Sharon Gitau withheld details of her life out of fear that her grandmother would react negatively. Movement of the roommates outside of the residence is restricted to places that are cleared by producers through contractual arrangements with locations to allow filming.

The producers made an exception to the taping protocol during the third season, when Pedro Zamora requested that he be allowed to go out on a date without the cameras, because the normal anxieties associated with first dates would be exacerbated by the presence of cameras.

===Confessional===
At the end of each week, each housemate is required to sit down and be interviewed about the past week&#x27;s events. Unlike the normal day-to-day taping, these interviews, which are referred to as &quot;confessionals&quot;, involve the subject looking directly into the camera while providing opinions and reflective accounts of the week&#x27;s activities, which are used in the final, edited episodes. The producers instruct the cast to talk about whatever they wish, and to speak in complete sentences, to reinforce the perception on the part of the home viewer that the cast is speaking to them. Winick described this practice as &quot;like therapy without the help&quot;. The confessionals were originally conducted by Mary-Ellis Bunim and Jonathan Murray, but were eventually delegated to production staff members like George Verschoor and Thomas Klein. Beginning with the second season (Los Angeles), a small soundproof room was incorporated into each house for this purpose, which itself has also become known as the Confessional in which cast members could record themselves and provide thoughts about house and life events. (The soundproofing practice appears to have been discontinued in later seasons.)

The various casts were often creative in their use of the confessional, which Bunim and Murray referred to as &quot;inspired lunacy&quot;, such as a group confessional that the Los Angeles cast conducted on their last day in order to appear less contentious, but which ended with them arguing and storming out, an appearance by San Francisco housemate Judd Winick in a nun&#x27;s habit, and Miami roommates Melissa Padrón and Flora Alekseyeun dressing up as sex workers for a shared confessional in which they discuss why their roommates did not get along with them. During Mardi Gras, 2000 New Orleans cast member Danny Roberts used the confessional to engage in a sex act.

===Evolution and changes===
Initially, the show documented the housemates as they struggled to find and maintain jobs and careers in their new locales, with minimal group activities aside from their day-to-day lives in the house and their socializing in the city. The only group activity engineered by the producers during the first season was a trip for the three women to Jamaica. By the second season, sending the entire cast on a vacation and/or short-term local trip would become the norm for most seasons. By the fifth season, the cast would be given an ongoing, season-long activity, with the Miami cast given startup money and a business advisor to begin their own business. This aspect of the show remained in most subsequent seasons. The assignments are obligatory, with casts assigned to work at an after-school daycare program, a radio station, public-access television station, etc. Beginning with the tenth season, a rule was implemented that required a roommate fired from the group job to be evicted from the house and dropped from the cast. Hollywood&#x27;s Greg Halstead and Cancun&#x27;s Joey Rozmus were evicted from their respective houses after they were fired from their group jobs. Later seasons provided the cast with pre-approved jobs they could apply for without the firing rule, while other casts took part in internships or did not pursue work.

===Editing===
Footage taped throughout each season is edited into episodes (half-hour episodes for the first 19 seasons, one-hour episodes beginning with the twentieth).

==Rules and discipline==
===Physical violence===
Physical violence of any kind is typically not tolerated by the producers. After an incident occurs, producers or cast members are typically given the choice as to whether a violent housemate can stay due to a contract clause that prohibits violence. After an incident during the Seattle season in which Stephen Williams slapped Irene McGee as she moved out, a response to the event was debated by the housemates, who did not witness the incident was viewed a videotape of it. The producers, not wanting to be seen condoning violence, gave the housemates the choice of having him leave, but instead the housemates chose to let him stay, and Williams was ordered to attend an anger management class. During the 2002–2003 Las Vegas season, Brynn Smith and Steven Hill got into an altercation in which Smith threw a fork at Hill. Hill contacted the producers who notified him that it was up to the cast to decide on Smith&#x27;s fate. The cast let Hill make the ultimate decision, and he chose that Smith could stay. During the Sydney season, Trisha Cummings shoved Parisa Montazaran to the ground during a heated altercation. Producers gave Montazaran the choice as to whether Cummings could stay or leave, and she chose that Cummings had to leave. Denver housemates Tyrie Ballard and Davis Mallory got into an explosive altercation that required production to intervene on-screen and separate the two before any violence occurred. Similarly, Hollywood castmates William Gilbert and Dave Malinosky got into a similar fight with fellow housemate Greg Halstead that also required intervention from production, as well as Gilbert and Malinosky to undergo anger management. During the Portland season, Nia Moore physically attacked Johnny Reilly in retaliation for Reilly purposely throwing a drink on her during a heated altercation, and later got into a physical altercation with Averey Tressler, when Tressler defended Reilly from an attempt by Moore to attack Reilly again with a hair dryer. Unlike most prior seasons where the one assaulted housemate was given the sole choice as to whether the attacker could stay, the Portland cast had its producers decide that only those not involved in the confrontation could decide whether Moore could stay via a majority vote. They chose to let her stay, and producers did not order Moore to anger management, despite subsequent threats to attack other cast members. As a result, Reilly and Tressler chose to leave the loft during that season&#x27;s final episode. In the final three episodes of the &quot;Go Big or Go Home&quot; season, castmates Jenna Thomason and Ceejai Jenkins got into two physical altercations while in the house. During the second altercation, Jenkins gave Thomason a black eye and bruises. As a result, both were removed by production due to the altercation.

===Drug use===
Cast members are also subject to random drug tests, and a cast member failing a drug test will lead to him or her being evicted from the house. During the Hollywood season, it became known that Joey Kovar, had used large amounts of alcohol, cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine, as well as steroids that he used in bodybuilding since he was a teenager, and had suffered near-fatal overdose. Because of the erratic behavior he displayed as a result of this, he was asked to leave the show to pursue treatment. Kovar would later die of opiate intoxication on August 17, 2012, at the age of 29. During the St. Thomas season, Brandon Kane was removed from the house in that season&#x27;s eleventh episode after testing positive for cocaine use.

===Property damage===
Cast members are held responsible for any damage to property that occurred within the house. For example, Brooklyn&#x27;s J.D. Ordoñez was required to pay $350 after destroying a coffee table in one episode. Cancun&#x27;s Bronne Bruzgo was evicted from the hotel that served as the cast residence following a drunken incident in which he threw a fire extinguisher from a balcony to a pool below, though he was provided with nearby alternative housing by Student City, the cast&#x27;s season employer. 2011 Las Vegas&#x27; Adam Royer was held responsible for the $3,105 worth of damage that his drunken and disorderly behavior caused to the suite that housed that season&#x27;s cast.

==Recurring themes==

===Prejudice===
As their experiences on &quot;The Real World&quot; were often the first time that cast members encountered people of different races or sexual orientations, many episodes documented conflict over these issues. First season housemate Kevin Powell had such arguments with Eric Nies, Julie Gentry, and Rebecca Blasband. The premiere episode of the Los Angeles season depicted regional epithets exchanged between Jon Brennan, Dominic Griffin, and Tami Roman. 1994 San Francisco housemate David &quot;Puck&quot; Rainey&#x27;s treatment of Pedro Zamora&#x27;s homosexuality was an issue for Zamora. Flora Alekseyeun, during an argument with her Miami roommate Cynthia Roberts, dismissed what she referred to as Roberts&#x27; &quot;black attitude&quot;, and their roommate Melissa Padrón, during a heated exchange with openly gay Dan Renzi, called him a &quot;flamer&quot;. Racism and religious intolerance was a point of contention among 2000 New Orleans housemates Julie Stoffer, Melissa Howard and Jamie Murray on more than one occasion.

The stereotypical views about black people imparted to &quot;Back to New York&quot; Mike Mizanin by his uncle offended Coral Smith and Nicole Mitsch when he related them, and they tried to educate him on African American culture. They were also offended by the fact that biracial roommate Malik Cooper wore a T-shirt with the image of Marcus Garvey, who was against miscegenation, despite the fact that Cooper was of mixed heritage and by his own admission had never dated a black woman.

Philadelphia&#x27;s Karamo Brown expressed being &quot;borderline racist&quot; towards White people, though he had softened in these feelings by the end of the season. In the Denver season, Davis Mallory and Stephen Nichols confronted each other over Mallory&#x27;s homosexuality and Nichols&#x27; race, and Mallory later used a racial epithet during a drunken argument with black housemate Tyrie Ballard.

During the Sydney season, Persian housemate Parisa Montazaran was offended at an anecdote related by housemate Trisha Cummings, in which Cummings described an Asian McDonald&#x27;s employee whose command of English was not perfect, though Cummings later insisted that she misworded her anecdote. A similar confrontation occurred during the Brooklyn season between J.D. Ordoñez and Chet Cannon, after a drunk Ordoñez made offensive statements about immigrants, following an incident at a drugstore.

Hollywood&#x27;s Kimberly Alexander got into an argument with Brianna Taylor, who is African American, and said, &quot;Let&#x27;s not get ghetto.&quot; When roommate William Gilbert saw this as racist, Alexander explained that Taylor had previously described herself as sometimes behaving &quot;ghetto&quot;, and was merely referencing that.

During the 2010 New Orleans season, tensions escalated between Ryan Leslie and openly gay Preston Roberson-Charles, amid questions about Leslie&#x27;s own sexuality, and their mutual use of homophobic slurs. In addition, Roberson-Charles also drew some homophobic remarks from housemate Ryan Knight. During the 2011 San Diego season, tensions arose between Frank Sweeney and his male housemates Zach Nichols and Nate Stodghill over Sweeney&#x27;s bisexuality, and Nichols later made what he said he intended to be a humorous remark to lesbian roommate Sam McGinn that alluded to gay bashing, to which McGinn took exception. In the &quot;Go Big or Go Home&quot; season, Jenna Thomason made homophobic and racist comments toward her roommates, causing tension between her and the rest of the cast.

===Politics and religion===
Los Angeles housemate Jon Brennan disagreed with Tami Roman&#x27;s decision to have an abortion, and argued with castmate Aaron Behle, and Behle&#x27;s girlfriend, Erin, who were both pro-choice. Rachel Campos, a conservative Republican member of the 1994 San Francisco cast, clashed with liberal roommates Mohammed Bilal and Judd Winick. Paris housemates Simon Sherry-Wood and Leah Gillingwater argued over the Iraq War, and in a subsequent episode, Chris &quot;C.T.&quot; Tamburello became confrontational and threatening toward Adam King, referencing the war himself. Nehemiah Clark, of the Austin cast, expressed disapproval of President George W. Bush and the Iraq War, coming into conflict with Rachel Moyal, who served in Iraq as a combat medic for the U.S. Army. Sydney&#x27;s Dunbar Flinn angered Parisa Montazaran and Trisha Cummings with his comments about Jesus and the Bible. The 2008 United States Presidential election served to highlight the political differences among the Brooklyn cast. In the Washington, D.C., season premiere, atheist Ty Ruff got into an argument with Christian roommates Ashley Lindley and Mike Manning.

===Romance===
Many cast members tried to maintain long-distance relationships that predated their time on the show, though remaining faithful was often a challenge. Miami&#x27;s Flora Alekseyeun attempted to maintain relationships with two boyfriends simultaneously. 2000 New Orleans&#x27; Danny Roberts cheated on his boyfriend Paul, who was stationed in the military. During the Seattle season, Nathan Blackburn&#x27;s girlfriend worried about their relationship. Shauvon Torres departed from the Sydney house to reconcile with her ex-fiancé. Her housemates, Trisha Cummings, KellyAnne Judd and Dunbar Merrin, all flirted, dated or had sex with people other than their significant others back home. Cancun&#x27;s Jonna Mannion, Washington D.C.&#x27;s Josh Colón and 2011 Las Vegas&#x27; Nany González severed long-term relationships following suspicions and admissions of infidelity, and in the case of González, after she began a relationship with housemate Adam Royer.

Some cast members developed romantic relationships with their castmates. 1994 San Francisco roommates Pam Ling and Judd Winick have since married, as have their roommate Rachel Campos and Sean Duffy of the Boston cast. In the 2002–2003 Las Vegas season, Trishelle Cannatella and Steven Hill consummated a romance during the show, while their roommates Irulan Wilson and Alton Williams began a relationship that continued for three years after they moved out of the Las Vegas suite. The Austin cast spawned two relationships, between Wes Bergmann and Johanna Botta, as well as Danny Jamieson and Melinda Stolp; the latter couple married in August 2008 but divorced in spring 2010. Hollywood&#x27;s William Gilbert became involved in a relationship with &quot;The Real World: Key West&quot; alumna Janelle Casanave, who made guest appearances in several episodes during that season. However, their relationship ended when Gilbert later became attracted to his roommate Brittni Sherrod. Portland housemates Johnny Reilly and Averey Tressler developed a mutual attraction, leading to a relationship that they continued for one year after filming ended.

===Sexuality===
The level of sexual experience varies among a given season&#x27;s cast members. New York&#x27;s Julie Gentry, Los Angeles&#x27; Jon Brennan and Aaron Behle, 1994 San Francisco&#x27;s Cory Murphy and Rachel Campos, Seattle&#x27;s Rebecca Lord, 2000 New Orleans&#x27; Matt Smith and Julie Stoffer, Paris&#x27; Mallory Snyder, Austin&#x27;s Lacey Buehler, Brooklyn&#x27;s Chet Cannon and Atlanta&#x27;s Meagan Melancon, for example, all stated they were virgins during their respective seasons. On the other end of the spectrum was 2000 New Orleans&#x27; David Broom, Cancun&#x27;s Joey Rozmus, and 2011 Las Vegas&#x27;s Heather Cooke, who took pride in their promiscuity with various sexual partners during their respective seasons. Denver&#x27;s Jenn Grijalva and Alex Smith, Sydney&#x27;s KellyAnne Judd and Dunbar Flinn, Cancun&#x27;s Ayiiia Elizarraras, and 2011 Las Vegas&#x27; Nany González and Heather Marter were sexually intimate with multiple castmates during their respective seasons.

More than once, fellow housemates have been involved in pregnancy scares, such as Steven Hill and Trishelle Cannatella during the 2002–2003 Las Vegas season, Cohutta Grindstaff and KellyAnne Judd during the Sydney season, and Leroy Garrett and Naomi Defensor during the 2011 Las Vegas season.

London&#x27;s Sharon Gitau expressed difficulty with relationships, and with being open about this and other aspects of her life with her castmates.

Overt sexual behavior was minimal during the show&#x27;s early seasons, relegated mostly to discussion. In subsequent seasons, the level of sexual activity greatly increased, beginning with the Miami season, which depicted or touched upon activities such as exhibitionism, frottage, voyeurism, and threesomes.

===Unrequited love===
Jon Brennan&#x27;s Los Angeles roommates speculated that he had developed a crush, or possibly had fallen in love, with Irene Berrera. 2000 New Orleans&#x27; Melissa Howard was attracted to Jamie Murray, who did not reciprocate. Their roommate Julie Stoffer harbored similar feelings for Matt Smith, who also did not reciprocate. &quot;Back to New York&quot;″s Lori Trespicio developed an attraction for Kevin Dunn, though he only saw her as a friend.

===Departed housemates===
Many times, housemates have left the &quot;Real World&quot; house (and the cast) before production was completed, due to conflicts with other roommates, personal issues, homesickness or violations of work assignment policies. Replacement roommates would sometimes move in as a result. Housemates who departed over personal conflicts with other housemates include Los Angeles&#x27; David Edwards, San Francisco&#x27;s David &quot;Puck&quot; Rainey, Sydney&#x27;s Trisha Cummings, 2010 New Orleans&#x27; Ryan Leslie and Ex-Plosion&#x27;s Ashley Mitchell, though Rainey, Leslie and Mitchell continued to appear in subsequent episodes following their departures. Housemates who moved out due to personal issues back home include Hawaii&#x27;s Justin Deabler, Sydney&#x27;s Shauvon Torres and Portland&#x27;s Joi Niemeyer. Housemates who moved out due to homesickness include 2004 San Diego&#x27;s Frankie Abernathy and Washington D.C.&#x27;s Erika Wasilewski. Housemates who were evicted after being fired from group work assignments include Hollywood&#x27;s Greg Halstead and Cancun&#x27;s Joey Rozmus, though Rozmus returned by that season&#x27;s finale. Housemates who were evicted for either physical altercations or reckless behavior include 2011 Las Vegas&#x27; Adam Royer, &quot;Go Big or Go Home&quot;&#x27;s Jenna Thomason and Ceejai Jenkins, &quot;Bad Blood&quot;&#x27;s Theo King-Bradley and Peter Romeo and Atlanta&#x27;s Clint Wright, though Royer later returned for that season&#x27;s twelfth episode.

Housemates have also departed for other reasons. Irene Barrera moved out of the Los Angeles house when she got married. Irene McGee claimed a relapse of Lyme disease was the reason for her moving out of the Seattle house, though in a previously unaired interview from her time on the show that aired during the 2000 reunion show, &quot;The Real World Reunion 2000&quot;, she explained that the main reason was her ethical objections to aspects of the show&#x27;s production, which she characterized as an inauthentic environment designed to fabricate drama and conflict, and not the social experiment it was portrayed to be. McGee further explained that this was an unhealthy environment for her to live in, and that the stress and manipulation of the production exacerbated her illness. Joey Kovar moved out of the Hollywood house, fearing a drug and alcohol relapse after spending time in rehab, though he returned for that season&#x27;s finale. St. Thomas&#x27; Brandon Kane was the first cast member ever evicted for failing a random drug test during filming. &quot;Ex-Plosion&quot; Lauren Ondersma and &quot;Bad Blood&quot; Tyara Hooks departed after finding out they were pregnant.

===On-screen marriage===
Irene Barrera got married during the Los Angeles season. Pedro Zamora exchanged wedding vows with his boyfriend, Sean Sasser, during the 1994 San Francisco season.

===Coping with illness===
Pedro Zamora lived with AIDS. He succumbed to complications related to the disease on November 11, 1994, hours after the 1994 San Francisco season finale aired. 2004 San Diego housemate Frankie Abernathy suffered from cystic fibrosis. She died on July 9, 2007.

Philadelphia&#x27;s Sarah Burke, Key West&#x27;s Paula Meronek, and Skeletons&#x27; Violetta Milerman each suffered from an eating disorder, anorexia and/or bulimia. Denver&#x27;s Colie Edison battled mononucleosis. Cancun&#x27;s Ayiiia Elizarraras had a history of drug abuse and self-harming, the latter of which manifested during that season&#x27;s fifth episode. She received treatment for it after filming ended, and recorded a public service announcement on the condition that it aired at the end of that episode. 2010 New Orleans&#x27; Ryan Leslie suffered from severe obsessive compulsive disorder, which had deleterious effects on his relationship with the rest of the cast.

One recurring illness with which a number of cast members have dealt is addiction. While cast members sometimes become inebriated in social situations during filming, Hawaii&#x27;s Ruthie Alcaide and Hollywood&#x27;s Joey Kovar entered treatment programs for drug or alcohol addiction during filming. Other cast members have recounted past troubles with addiction that they had endured prior to filming, including 2002 Chicago&#x27;s Chris Beckman, Hollywood&#x27;s Brianna Taylor, 2010 New Orleans&#x27; Ryan Knight, St. Thomas&#x27; Brandon Kane, and &quot;Skeletons&quot;″ Madison Walls.

==Seasons==

:Note: Seasons 20–32 aired one-hour episodes, while seasons 1–19 and 33 aired 30-minute episodes.
===&quot;Homecoming&quot;===
In addition to the main edition of the show, a handful of reunion specials of &quot;The Real World&quot; have been produced, where the casts from a particular season were reunited for another season of the show. The original Vegas reunion followed the cast as they returned to stay in their original residence with planned activities for them. The reunion series that began in 2021 (titled &quot;The Real World: Homecoming&quot;) maintained this basic premise while having an additional element of having the original cast occasionally watch footage from their original show and answering prompts.
==Spinoffs and related projects==
In 2008, prior to the airing of the Hollywood season, the first-ever &quot;Real World Awards Bash&quot; aired on MTV. Viewers voted the Austin season as their favorite season.

Since the introduction of &quot;The Real World&quot;, Bunim/Murray has introduced a number of other reality shows, most notably &quot;Road Rules&quot;, in which five strangers (six in later seasons) are sent off in a RV (with the exception of the eighth season) and asked to travel to various locales and complete certain tasks to eventually gain a &quot;handsome reward&quot;. Other Bunim/Murray productions include &quot;The Challenge&quot;, which pits teams of alumni from both shows against each other in physical competitions.

Bunim-Murray also produced &quot;Pedro&quot;, a 2008 film by director Nick Oceano, which dramatized the life of Pedro Zamora, including his stay in the &quot;Real World&quot; house. The film, Bunim/Murray&#x27;s first scripted project since the original unaired &quot;Real World&quot; concept, was an Official Selection at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival.

Two international localized editions were produced in the 1990s, &quot;The Real World: Stockholm&quot; and &quot;The Real World: Visby&quot;.

In February 2021, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Paramount was planning to develop future seasons for its streaming service Paramount+. The following month, the spin-off &quot;The Real World Homecoming: New York&quot; premiered on Paramount+, which reunited the cast of the original 1992 season. In September 2021, the series was renewed for two more seasons, with the second reuniting most of the cast of &quot;The Real World: Los Angeles&quot;. Because the majority of the original series&#x27; casts between the 3rd and 8th seasons declined any offers to return (and a London-set reunion was unconsidered because of the cost and logistical issues of holding it outside the U.S.), the third edition jumped ahead to a reunion of the 9th season in New Orleans, which like the RH: NY season had all of the original cast members return. The show has since been removed from Paramount+ streaming archives and as of 2025 there are no plans for any future &quot;Homecoming&quot; editions.

===&quot;The Real World Movie: The Lost Season&quot;===
In 2002, MTV also produced a made-for-TV movie, &quot;The Real World Movie: The Lost Season&quot;, ostensibly about a season of &quot;The Real World&quot; whose cast members are terrorized by a rejected would-be member.

==Criticism==
===Authenticity===

As with other reality shows, &quot;The Real World&quot; has received criticism for being staged. During a reunion show featuring the first four &quot;Real World&quot; casts, Heather Gardner, of the original New York cast, asked some members of the 1994 San Francisco cast if their situations were real. She noted that situations from the original season seemed to repeat themselves in the other incarnations, stopping short of accusing them of acting. On an edition of the &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; that spotlighted the series, cast member Jon Brennan revealed that he was asked by the producers to state on the air that he felt hatred towards housemate Tami Roman for her decision to have an abortion, and that he refused to do so, stating that although he disagreed with her decision, he did not feel hatred towards her. Another accusation is that producers selectively edit material in order to give the false impression of certain emotional reactions or statements from the castmates. &quot;New York&quot; cast member Rebecca Blasband says producers paid a man $100 to ask her out on a date, and that she terminated that plan when she learned of it. She also says that the argument she and Kevin Powell had in the seventh episode of that season was edited to make both of them appear more extreme.

Some critics see the very concept of being in &quot;the real world&quot; as a misnomer, asserting that in the real world, people do not live in luxurious dwellings for free, are not given jobs in the media without any effort, and are not taken to exotic locations for free, a &#x27;reaction&#x27; that has been &#x27;experienced&#x27; by Judd Winick, who calls the series &quot;reality in context&quot;.

===Behavior of housemates===
The early seasons have been reassessed in light of history, and in comparison to that of later seasons, particularly in terms of the cast. Writing in 2011, Meredith Blake of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; found the first-season cast&#x27;s career goals to be &quot;ambitious, articulate, and thoughtful&quot;, particularly in the context of the time when the show was produced, when cast members may have sought to be on TV to further their career goals, but not to be reality TV personalities, which was not yet a common goal at the time, stating, &quot;What&#x27;s so curious about the show&#x27;s somewhat chilly critical reception is that, compared to today&#x27;s reality fare—&quot;Jersey Shore&quot;, the Kardashians, the various &quot;Real Housewives—The Real World: New York&quot; now seems incredibly, achingly earnest, bracingly raw, and sweetly idealistic.&quot; Blake contrasts this with the casts of later seasons, such as that of 2011, who tend to be defined more by their pasts than by their career goals, and who are never unaware of their own onscreen &quot;narrative&quot;. In addition, the later seasons earned the series a reputation for immature or irresponsible behavior on the part of the cast, which Nola.com has described as being &quot;sometimes fit for a police report&quot;. On the final track of his &quot;Become the Media&quot; spoken word album, activist Jello Biafra discusses a conversation he had with &quot;The Real World: Seattle&quot; cast member Irene McGee, who was slapped by castmate Stephen Williams, saying:

McGee has toured colleges to discuss media manipulation and the falsehoods of reality television. She later started a youth-oriented radio show/podcast, &quot;No One&#x27;s Listening&quot;, covering a wide range of pop-culture and media-related issues.

The show has also been accused of encouraging or glorifying certain cast members’ alcohol abuse and sexual antics, beginning with the show&#x27;s 2002 Las Vegas season. &quot;The Real World: Hawaii&quot; (1999) season was also met with concerns and criticism surrounding the glorification of alcohol on the show, notably with then-21-year-old cast member Ruthie Alcaide’s heavy drinking on the premiere episode; after a long night out, Alcaide blacked-out. She was filmed by the camera crew being cared-for at home by the other housemates, and even vomiting in the shower; eventually, an ambulance was called. After being hospitalized, producers were filmed speaking to Alcaide about her drinking, which, notably, did not immediately stop at that time.

There is a larger perception that the show has become increasingly superficial, with respect to the drama and angst depicted on the part of cast members. As critic Benjamin Wallace-Wells put it:

A 2006 comment from &quot;LA Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Nikki Finke reflects the same sentiments:

The Parents Television Council, which has frequently criticized MTV, has also frequently criticized &quot;The Real World&quot; for its overtly sexual content. In addition, that organization contends that because MTV routinely reruns &quot;Real World&quot; episodes with a simple &quot;TV-14&quot; rating without the &quot;L&quot; (language) descriptor, parents cannot block out the show with a V-Chip, although countering reports claim that the V-Chip does not totally rely on content descriptors added to the general ratings to work. An episode of &quot;The Real World: San Diego&quot;, that was broadcast in January 2004, came under intense criticism from both the PTC and American Family Association for its sexual content.

===Diversity===
In December 2005, Aaron Gillego, a columnist for &quot;The Advocate&quot;, criticized the series for having never cast an Asian man in the then-13 years of its existence, opining that Asian women have been cast on the show because heterosexual men have been socialized by the media to think of them as exotic beauties or sex objects, but that Asian men have been largely invisible in popular media. As of 2018, an Asian man has never been cast in the 25 years of the show&#x27;s existence.

==Parodies==
* Dutch TV producer Erik Latour claims that the ideas for &quot;The Real World&quot; were directly derived from his television show &quot;Nummer 28&quot;, which aired in 1991 on Dutch television.
* Video artist Eileen Maxson&#x27;s short film &quot;Tape 5925: Amy Goodrow&quot; is set up as an audition tape for &quot;The Real World&quot;, a familiar component of the series&#x27; casting specials and season openers. Maxson portrays the title character, a sensitive and awkward young woman whose main hobby is paper craft, and reveals a surprising sexual encounter between her teenage self and a teacher. The resulting confession lands on the desk of a jaded MTV employee, who fast-forwards through the details of her depressing story. The video was named one of the &quot;sweet 16&quot; experimental film and video works of 2003 by &quot;Village Voice&quot; media critic Ed Halter.
* On &quot;Happy Endings&quot;, three of the core characters met during the season of &quot;The Real World&quot; titled &quot;The Real World: Sacramento&quot;. In the episode &quot;More Like Stanksgiving&quot;, the characters watch clips from an episode of their &quot;The Real World&quot; season. The fictional season was said to have not aired due to one of the cast members burning down the house.

<text>Erik XIV or Eric XIV (13 December 153326 February 1577) became King of Sweden following the death of his father, Gustav I, on 29 September 1560. During a 1568 rebellion against him, Erik was incarcerated by his half-brother John III. He was formally deposed by the Riksdag on 26 January 1569. Erik was also ruler of Estonia, after it placed itself under Swedish protection in 1561.

While Erik has been regarded as intelligent and artistically skilled, as well as politically ambitious, early in his reign he showed signs of mental instability, a condition that eventually led to insanity. Some scholars claim that his illness began early during his reign, while others believe that it first manifested with the Sture murders.

Erik, having been imprisoned and deposed, was most likely murdered. An examination of his remains in 1958 confirmed that he probably died of arsenic poisoning.

==Early years==

Erik XIV was born at Tre Kronor Castle, the morning of 13 December 1533. His mother, Catherine of Saxe-Lauenburg, died before he reached the age of two. In 1536, his father, Gustav I (Gustav Vasa), married Margaret Leijonhufvud, a Swedish noblewoman.

Erik&#x27;s first teacher was the learned German Georg Norman, whose services were shortly thereafter needed elsewhere within the Swedish state. He was replaced by French Calvinist Dionysius Beurraeus (1500–67). Dionysius taught both Erik and his half-brother John, and seems to have been appreciated by both. Erik was very successful in foreign languages and mathematics. He was also an informed historian, a good writer and familiar with astrology.

When Erik started to appear in public, he was referred to as &quot;chosen king&quot; () and after the meeting of parliament in Stockholm in 1560, he received the title of &quot;hereditary king&quot; ().
In 1557, Erik was assigned the fiefdoms of Kalmar, Kronoberg and Öland. He took up residence in the city of Kalmar.

Against his father&#x27;s wishes, Erik entered into marriage negotiations with the future Elizabeth I of England and pursued her for several years. Tensions between Erik and his father grew. Erik also made unsuccessful marriage proposals to, among others, Mary, Queen of Scots (1542–1587), Renata of Lorraine (1544–1602), Anna of Saxony (1544–1577) and Christine of Hesse (1543–1604).

==Rule==
Erik learned of his father&#x27;s death as he was on the point of embarking for England to press his suit for the hand of Queen Elizabeth I. Back in Stockholm he summoned a Riksdag, which met at Arboga on 15 April 1561. There he adopted the royal propositions known as the &quot;Arboga articles&quot;, considerably curtailing the authority of the royal dukes, his half-brothers John and Charles, in their respective provinces. He was crowned as Erik XIV, but was not necessarily the 14th king of Sweden named Erik. He and his brother Charles adopted regnal numbers according to Johannes Magnus&#x27;s partly fictitious history of Sweden. There had, however, been at least six earlier Swedish kings with the name of Erik, as well as pretenders about whom very little is known.

From the start of his reign, Erik was in opposition to the Swedish nobility. He chose as a close adviser Jöran Persson (1530–68), who had narrowly escaped execution under Erik&#x27;s father. Persson was also opposed to the nobility and a determined opponent of Erik&#x27;s half-brother, later John III of Sweden (1537–92). John was the Duke of Finland and was married to a Polish princess, against Erik&#x27;s wishes, which made him friendly with Poland. John pursued an expansionist policy in Livonia (now Estonia and Latvia), in breach of the Arboga articles, which led to contention between the brothers. In 1563, John was seized by an army sent to Finland, and tried for high treason by Erik&#x27;s order.

Unlike his father, who had been satisfied with ruling an independent state, Erik tried to expand his influence in the Baltic region and in Estonia, beginning the process that resulted in Sweden becoming a great power in the 17th century. This expansionism resulted in a clash with his cousin, Frederick II of Denmark-Norway (1534–88). Most of Erik XIV&#x27;s reign was then dominated by the Livonian War and the Scandinavian Seven Years&#x27; War against Denmark-Norway (1563–70), during which he successfully repelled most Danish-Norwegian attempts at conquest, but was unable to keep his own acquisitions.From 1563 onwards, his insanity became pronounced; his rule became even more arbitrary and marked by violence. His suspicion of the nobility led him to suspicions of the Sture family, then headed by Svante Stensson Sture, the brother-in-law of Erik&#x27;s father. King Erik first acted against the family in 1566, accusing Svante&#x27;s son Nils of treason, but commuted the sentence and instead sent Nils to Lorraine, supposedly to arrange a marriage with Princess Renata of Lorraine. However, Erik had determined to marry his mistress Karin Månsdotter and in 1567, on Nils&#x27;s return and suspicious of high treason, he killed several members of the family in the so-called Sture Murders, Erik himself stabbing Nils Svantesson Sture. The king probably thought of the killing as an execution rather than murder.

==Downfall==

After the Sture murders, Duke John was imprisoned and Erik&#x27;s conflict with the nobility came to its climax. Early in 1568, Erik seemed to recover his reason, and attempted to reconcile with his brother on the condition that the latter recognize Erik&#x27;s marriage with Karin Månsdotter. This marriage was solemnized in July, Karin was crowned queen, and their infant son Gustav pronounced prince-royal. However, in the fall of 1568, asserting Erik&#x27;s insanity, the dukes and the nobles rebelled, and after some resistance, Erik was imprisoned by John, who took power on 30 September. Jöran Persson was assigned much of the blame for the actions directed against the nobility during Erik XIV&#x27;s reign and was executed shortly after John III had incarcerated Erik, who was legally dethroned in January 1569 by the Riksdag.

==Imprisonment and death==

For the next eight years the ex-king was a source of anxiety to the new government. Three rebellions – the 1569 Plot, the Mornay Plot and the 1576 Plot – with the object of releasing and reinstating him, had to be suppressed, and Erik was held as a prisoner in many different castles in both Sweden and Finland. He died in prison in Örbyhus Castle. According to a tradition starting with Johannes Messenius, his final meal was a poisoned bowl of pea soup. A document signed by his brother, John III, and a nobleman, Bengt Bengtsson Gylta (1514–74), gave Erik&#x27;s guards in his last prison authorization to poison him if anyone tried to release him. His body was later exhumed and modern forensic analysis revealed evidence of lethal arsenic poisoning.

==Family and descendants==

Erik XIV had several relationships before his marriage.

With Agda Persdotter:

#Virginia Eriksdotter (1559–1633; living descendants)
#Constantia Eriksdotter (1560–1649; living descendants)
#Lucretia Eriksdotter (1564–after 1574) died young.

With Karin Jacobsdotter:
#An unnamed child, died April 1565.

Erik XIV finally married Karin Månsdotter (1550–1612) on 4 July 1568; their children were:
# Sigrid (1566–1633; born before the marriage), lady-in-waiting, wife of two noblemen.
# Gustaf (1568–1607; born before the marriage), mercenary 
#Henrik (1570–74)
#Arnold (1572–73)

==Erik XIV in literature==

The life of Erik XIV is the subject of an 1899 play by Swedish playwright August Strindberg (1849–1912), which was later adapted into a film, &quot;Karin Månsdotter&quot;. The love story of Erik XIV and Karin Månsdotter is the subject of a 1942 historical novel by Mika Waltari.

<doc id="104957" wikidata="Q1143822" url="?curid=104957" title="Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation">
<text>The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation is a nonprofit organization founded in 1937 by philanthropist Solomon R. Guggenheim and his long-time art advisor, artist Hilla von Rebay. The foundation is a leading institution for the collection, preservation, and research of modern and contemporary art and operates several museums around the world. The first museum established by the foundation was The Museum of Non-Objective Painting, in New York City. This became The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1952, and the foundation moved the collection into its first permanent museum building, in New York City, in 1959. The foundation next opened the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, Italy, in 1980. Its international network of museums expanded in 1997 to include the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Bilbao, Spain, and it expects to open a new museum, Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates after its construction is completed.

The mission of the foundation is &quot;to promote the understanding and appreciation of art, architecture, and other manifestations of visual culture, primarily of the modern and contemporary periods, and to collect, conserve, and study&quot; modern and contemporary art. The Foundation seeks, in its constituent museums, to unite distinguished architecture and artworks. The foundation&#x27;s first permanent museum, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, is housed in a modern spiral building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and the Guggenheim Bilbao was designed by Frank Gehry. Both of these innovative designs received wide press and critical attention. The Peggy Guggenheim Collection is housed in an 18th-century Italian palace, the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni, on the Grand Canal.

The permanent collection of the foundation is based primarily on nine private collections: Solomon R. Guggenheim&#x27;s collection of non-objective paintings; Karl Nierendorf&#x27;s collection of German expressionism and early abstract expressionism; Katherine S. Dreier&#x27;s gift of paintings and sculptures; Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s collection, concentrating on abstraction and surrealism; Justin K. and Hilde Thannhauser&#x27;s collection of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, and early modern masterpieces; part of Hilla von Rebay&#x27;s collection; Giuseppe Panza di Biumo&#x27;s holdings of American minimalist, post-minimalist, environmental and conceptual art of the 1960s and 1970s; a collection of photographs and mixed media from the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation; and the Bohen Foundation&#x27;s collection of film, video, photography and new media. The foundation&#x27;s collections have expanded greatly through eight decades and include every major movement of 20th- and 21st-century art. Its directors and curators have attempted to form a single collection that is not encyclopedic, but rather based on their unique visions. The collection has grown in scope to include new media and performance art, and the foundation has entered into collaborations with YouTube and BMW.

==History==

===Hilla Rebay and early years===
Solomon R. Guggenheim, a member of a wealthy mining family, began collecting works of the old masters in the 1890s. He retired from his business in 1919 to devote more time to art collecting. In 1926, at age 66, he met artist Hilla von Rebay, who was commissioned by Guggenheim&#x27;s wife, Irene Rothschild, to paint his portrait. Rebay introduced him to European avant-garde art, in particular abstract art that she felt had a spiritual and utopian aspect (non-objective art). Guggenheim completely changed his collecting strategy. In 1930, the two visited Wassily Kandinsky&#x27;s studio in Dessau, Germany, and Guggenheim began to purchase Kandinsky&#x27;s work. The same year, Guggenheim began to display the collection to the public at his apartment in the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Guggenheim&#x27;s purchases continued with the works of Rudolf Bauer, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay, and great artists who were not of the non-objective school, such as Marc Chagall, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Pablo Picasso and László Moholy-Nagy. Pieces from the collection were first shown outside New York City in 1936, when the Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston, South Carolina, displayed 128 of the collection&#x27;s paintings.
In 1937, Guggenheim established the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation to foster the appreciation of modern art. The foundation&#x27;s first venue for the display of art was called the &quot;Museum of Non-Objective Painting&quot;. It opened in 1939 under the direction of Rebay, its first curator, in a former automobile showroom at East 54th Street in midtown Manhattan. This moved, in 1947, to another rented space at 1071 Fifth Avenue. Under Rebay&#x27;s guidance, Guggenheim sought to include in the collection the most important examples of non-objective art available at the time, such as Kandinsky&#x27;s &quot;Composition 8&quot; (1923), Léger&#x27;s &quot;Contrast of Forms&quot; (1913) and Delaunay&#x27;s &quot;Simultaneous Windows&quot; (2nd Motif, 1st Part)&quot; (1912).

By the early 1940s, the foundation had accumulated such a large collection of avant-garde paintings that the need for a permanent building to house the art collection had become apparent. In 1943, Guggenheim and Rebay commissioned architect Frank Lloyd Wright to design the museum building. Rebay conceived of the space as a &quot;temple of the spirit&quot; that would facilitate a new way of looking at the modern pieces in the collection. In 1948, the collection was greatly expanded through the purchase of art dealer Karl Nierendorf&#x27;s estate of some 730 objects, notably German expressionist paintings. By that time, the foundation&#x27;s collection included a broad spectrum of expressionist and surrealist works, including paintings by Paul Klee, Oskar Kokoschka and Joan Miró. Guggenheim died in 1949, and the museum was renamed the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1952. The foundation expanded its display activities with a series of traveling exhibitions.

After Guggenheim&#x27;s death, members of the Guggenheim family who sat on the foundation&#x27;s board of directors had personal and philosophical differences with Rebay, and in 1952 she resigned as director of the museum. Nevertheless, she left a portion of her personal collection to the foundation in her will, including works by Kandinsky, Klee, Alexander Calder, Gleizes, Piet Mondrian and Kurt Schwitters.

===Sweeney and completion of the first building===

In 1953, the foundation&#x27;s collecting boundaries extended even further under its new director, James Johnson Sweeney. Sweeney rejected Rebay&#x27;s dismissal of &quot;objective&quot; painting and sculpture, and he soon acquired Constantin Brâncuși&#x27;s &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; (1921), followed by works of other modernist sculptors, including Jean Arp, Alexander Calder, Alberto Giacometti and David Smith. Sweeney reached beyond the 20th century to acquire Paul Cézanne&#x27;s &quot;Man with Crossed Arms&quot; (c. 1899). In 1953, the foundation received a gift of 28 important works from the Estate of Katherine S. Dreier, a founder of America&#x27;s first collection to be called a modern art museum, the Société Anonyme. Dreier had been a colleague of Rebay&#x27;s. The works included &quot;Little French Girl&quot; (1914–18) by Brâncuși, an untitled still life (1916) by Juan Gris, a bronze sculpture (1919) by Alexander Archipenko and three collages (1919–21) by German Hanoverian Dadaist Schwitters. It also included works by Calder, Marcel Duchamp, El Lissitzky and Mondrian. Among others, Sweeney also acquired the works of Alberto Giacometti, David Hayes, Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock. He also established the Guggenheim International Awards in 1956. Sweeney oversaw the last half dozen years of the construction of the museum building, during which time he had an antagonistic relationship with Frank Lloyd Wright, especially regarding the building&#x27;s lighting issues.

The distinctive cylindrical building, wider at the top than the bottom, with a spiral ramp climbing gently from ground level to the skylight at the top, turned out to be Wright&#x27;s last major work, as the architect died six months before its opening. The building opened in October 1959 to large crowds and instantly polarized architecture critics, though today it is widely praised. Some of the criticism focused on the idea that the building overshadows the artworks displayed inside, and that it is difficult to properly hang paintings in the shallow, windowless, concave exhibition niches that surround the central spiral. Prior to its opening, twenty-one artists signed a letter protesting the display of their work in such a space. Upon opening, the museum received a largely favorable response from the public, despite the early misgivings: &quot;overall Wright&#x27;s design was, and still is, admired for being highly personal and inviting&quot;.

===Messer and the ramp===
Thomas M. Messer succeeded Sweeney as director of the museum (but not the foundation) in 1961 and stayed for 27 years, the longest tenure of any of the city&#x27;s major arts institutions&#x27; directors. When Messer took over, the museum&#x27;s ability to present art at all was still in doubt due to the challenges presented by continuous spiral ramp gallery that is both tilted and has curved walls. Almost immediately, in 1962, he took a risk putting on a large exhibition that combined the Guggenheim&#x27;s paintings with sculptures on loan from the Hirshhorn Museum. Three-dimensional sculpture, in particular, raised &quot;the problem of installing such a show in a museum bearing so close a resemblance to the circular geography of hell&quot;, where any vertical object appears tilted in a &quot;drunken lurch&quot; because the slope of the floor and the curvature of the walls could combine to produce vexing optical illusions.

It turned out that the combination could work well in the Guggenheim&#x27;s space, but, Messer recalled that at the time, &quot;I was scared. I half felt that this would be my last exhibition.&quot; Messer had the foresight to prepare by staging a smaller sculpture exhibition the previous year, in which he discovered how to compensate for the space&#x27;s weird geometry by constructing special plinths at a particular angle, so the pieces were not at a true vertical yet appeared to be so. In the earlier sculpture show, this trick proved impossible for one piece, an Alexander Calder mobile whose wire inevitably hung at a true plumb vertical, &quot;suggesting hallucination&quot; in the disorienting context of the tilted floor.

The next year, Messer acquired a private collection from art dealer Justin K. Thannhauser for the foundation&#x27;s permanent collection. These 73 works include Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and French modern masterpieces, including important works by Paul Gauguin, Édouard Manet, Camille Pissarro, Vincent van Gogh and 32 works by Pablo Picasso.

===Global expansion===
Peggy Guggenheim, Solomon&#x27;s niece, collected and displayed art beginning in 1938. At Messer&#x27;s urging, she donated her art collection and home in Venice, the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni, to the foundation in 1976. After her death in 1979, the collection of more than 300 works was re-opened to the public as the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in 1980 by the foundation, which was then under the direction of Peter Lawson-Johnston. It includes early 20th century works of prominent American modernists and Italian futurists. Pieces in the collection embrace Cubism, Surrealism and Abstract expressionism. Some of the notable artists are Picasso, Dalí, Magritte, Brâncuși (including a sculpture from the &quot;Bird in Space&quot; series), eleven works by Pollock, Braque, Duchamp, Léger, Severini, Picabia, de Chirico, Mondrian, Kandinsky, Miró, Giacometti, Klee, Gorky, Calder, Max Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s daughter, Pegeen Vail Guggenheim.

Since 1985, the United States has selected the foundation to operate the U.S. Pavilion of the Venice Biennale, an exhibition held every other summer. In 1986, the foundation purchased the Palladian-style pavilion, built in 1930.

Thomas Krens, director of the foundation from 1988 to 2008, led a rapid expansion of the foundation&#x27;s collections. In 1991, he broadened the foundation&#x27;s holdings by acquiring the Panza Collection. Assembled by Count Giuseppe di Biumo and his wife, Giovanna, the Panza Collection includes examples of Minimalist sculptures by Carl Andre, Dan Flavin and Donald Judd, and Minimalist paintings by Robert Mangold, Brice Marden and Robert Ryman, as well as an array of Post-Minimal, Conceptual, and perceptual art by Robert Morris, Richard Serra, James Turrell, Lawrence Weiner and others, notably American examples of the 1960s and 1970s. In 1992, the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation gifted 200 of his best photographs to the foundation. The works spanned his entire output, from his early collages, Polaroids, portraits of celebrities, self-portraits, male and female nudes, flowers and statues. It also featured mixed-media constructions and included his well-known 1998 &quot;Self-Portrait&quot;. The acquisition initiated the foundation&#x27;s photography exhibition program.

Also in 1992, the New York museum building&#x27;s exhibition and other space was expanded by the addition of an adjoining rectangular tower, taller than the original spiral, and a renovation of the original building. The same year, the foundation opened the small Guggenheim Museum SoHo in the SoHo neighborhood of downtown Manhattan, designed by Arata Isozaki, and hosted exhibits that included &quot;Marc Chagall and the Jewish Theater&quot;, &quot;Paul Klee at the Guggenheim Museum&quot;, &quot;Robert Rauschenberg: A Retrospective&quot;, and &quot;Andy Warhol: The Last Supper&quot;. This space was kept after the main museum was re-opened, but it closed in 2002 due to an economic downturn. To finance these moves, controversially, the foundation sold works by Kandinsky, Chagall and Modigliani to raise $47 million, drawing considerable criticism for trading masters for &quot;trendy&quot; latecomers. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Michael Kimmelman wrote that the sales &quot;stretched the accepted rules of deaccessioning further than many American institutions have been willing to do.&quot; Krens defended the action as consistent with the museum&#x27;s principles, including expanding its international collection and building its &quot;postwar collection to the strength of our pre-war holdings&quot; and pointed out that such sales are a regular practice by museums.
One of Krens&#x27;s most significant initiatives was to expand the foundation&#x27;s international presence. The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened in 1997. Designed by Frank Gehry, the titanium, glass and limestone Guggenheim Bilbao is a centerpiece of the revitalization of the Basque city of Bilbao, Spain. The building was greeted with glowing praise from architecture critics. The Basque government funded the construction, while the Foundation purchased the artworks and manages the facility. The museum&#x27;s permanent collection includes works by modern and contemporary Basque and Spanish artists like Eduardo Chillida, Juan Muñoz and Antonio Saura, as well as works from the foundation, and it has organized various exhibitions curated by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.

Also in 1997, the foundation opened a small gallery in the Unter den Linden area of Berlin, Germany, as the Deutsche Guggenheim, in cooperation with the Deutsche Bank. The Deutsche Guggenheim had four exhibitions each year, complemented by educational programming, and it annually commissioned one, or occasionally two, new artworks or series by contemporary artists, which were then displayed at the museum in a special exhibition. After 14 years of operation, Deutsche Guggenheim closed at the end of 2012.

===Krens exhibitions and abortive projects===
Under Krens, the foundation mounted some of its most popular exhibitions: &quot;Africa: The Art of a Continent&quot; in 1996; &quot;China: 5,000 Years&quot; in 1998, &quot;Brazil: Body &amp; Soul&quot; in 2001; and &quot;The Aztec Empire&quot; in 2004. Unusual exhibitions included commercial art installations of Giorgio Armani suits and motorcycles. &quot;The New Criterion&quot;&#x27;s Hilton Kramer condemned both &quot;The Art of the Motorcycle&quot; and the retrospective of the work of fashion designer Armani. Others disagreed. A 2009 retrospective of Frank Lloyd Wright at the original New York building showcased the architect on the 50th anniversary of the opening of the building and was the museum&#x27;s most popular exhibit since it began keeping such attendance records in 1992.
In 2001, the foundation opened two new museums in Las Vegas, Guggenheim Las Vegas and Guggenheim Hermitage Museum, both designed by architect Rem Koolhaas. The museums showcased highlights of the collections, respectively, of the foundation and the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The first and larger of the two hosted one exhibition: &quot;The Art of the Motorcycle&quot;, before closing in 2003. The latter held ten exhibitions of masterworks by leading artists from the last six centuries, including Van Eyck, Titian, Velázquez, Van Gogh, Picasso, Pollock and Lichtenstein. The Guggenheim Hermitage Museum closed in 2008.

In 2001 the foundation also established the Sackler Center for Arts Education on the campus of the original New York building. The same year, the foundation received a gift of the large collection of the Bohen Foundation, which, for two decades, commissioned new works of art with an emphasis on film, video, photography and new media. Artists included in the collection are Pierre Huyghe, Sophie Calle and Jac Leirner. The foundation planned for a large Guggenheim museum on the waterfront in lower Manhattan, and it engaged Frank Gehry as the architect. His designs for the building were showcased in 2001 at the Fifth Avenue museum, but these plans were disrupted by the economic downturn of the early 2000s and the September 11, 2001 attacks, which prompted reconsideration of any plans in lower Manhattan. Other projects were considered but not completed in Rio de Janeiro, Vilnius, Salzburg, Taichung and Guadalajara

On January 19, 2005, the philanthropist Peter B. Lewis resigned from his position as chairman of the foundation, expressing his opposition to Krens&#x27; plans for further global expansion of the Guggenheim museums. Lewis had been the largest donor in the history of the Guggenheim. Tensions continued, however, and on February 27, 2008, Krens resigned from his position at the foundation. He remained, however, as an advisor for international affairs. Over his two decades at the head of the foundation, Krens was criticized not only for the deaccessioning of older works of the museum but for both his businesslike style and perceived populism and commercialization. One writer commented, &quot;Krens has been both praised and vilified for turning what was once a small New York institution into a worldwide brand, creating the first truly multinational arts institution. ... Krens transformed the Guggenheim into one of the best-known brand name in the arts.&quot;

=== Armstrong and later years ===

Richard Armstrong became the fifth director of the foundation on November 4, 2008. He had been director of the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for 12 years, where he had also served as chief curator and curator of contemporary art. In addition to its permanent collections, which continue to grow, the foundation administers loan exhibitions and co-organizes exhibitions with other museums to foster public outreach.

In 2006, Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, announced an agreement with the Guggenheim Foundation to build a new museum, &quot;Guggenheim Abu Dhabi&quot;. Gehry designed the structure, which will, if completed, be the foundation&#x27;s largest by far. It began construction on the northwest tip of Saadiyat Island, where a performing arts center and other museums have been built. The completion date has been pushed back repeatedly. The museum is expected to house modern and contemporary collections that will focus on Middle-Eastern contemporary art and to display special exhibitions from the foundation&#x27;s main collection.

In 2011, the city of Helsinki, Finland, commissioned the foundation to study the feasibility of constructing a museum there. The study recommended building the museum in Helsinki&#x27;s South Harbor. In 2012, the proposal was rejected by the city board, and in 2013, the foundation made a revised proposal. The Guggenheim&#x27;s licensing fee was to be funded by private sources; one journalist called the Foundation&#x27;s cost and revenue estimates &quot;speculative at best&quot;. An international architecture competition solicited designs for the museum, and in 2015, a design was chosen. In 2016 the Helsinki city council voted to reject the plan. 

Armstrong left the museum at the end of 2023. In June 2024, Mariët Westermann, previously the vice chancellor of New York University Abu Dhabi, became the Guggenheim&#x27;s first female director.

== Restitution claims ==
In 2007, the heirs of Berlin banker Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy requested the restitution of the Picasso painting &quot;Le Moulin de la Galette&quot; (1900), which they claimed he had sold under duress by the Nazis. The museum and the heirs settled the lawsuit in 2009. The presiding judge, Jed Rakoff, criticized the secrecy of the accord. In 2018, the museum returned the Ernst Ludwig Kirchner painting &quot;Artillerymen&quot; (1915) to the heirs of Alfred Flechtheim, who had owned the painting before it fell into the hands of a Nazi collector in 1938.

In 2023, the heirs of Karl and Rosie Adler sued the Guggenheim to claim the restitution of a Picasso painting, &quot;Woman Ironing&quot; (&quot;La repasseuse)&quot; (1904), which the Adlers sold to Justin Thannhauser in 1938, allegedly for a fraction of its value, to escape the Holocaust. They alleged that Thannhauser knowingly purchased the painting, and art from other Jews on the run, profiting unfairly from their distress. The museum says they contacted the Adler family before acquiring the painting as a part of Thannhauser&#x27;s bequest of his art collection in 1976, and at that time Karl Adler did not object.

The Guggenheim lists 289 artworks on the Nazi Era Provenance Internet Portal (NEPIP) but does not publish provenance for its collection.

==Architecture==
The foundation has long sought, in its constituent museums, to unite its artworks with distinguished architecture. In 1943, Hilla von Rebay and Solomon R. Guggenheim commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to build the foundation&#x27;s first permanent museum. Rebay wrote to Wright that &quot;each of these great masterpieces should be organized into space, and only you ... would test the possibilities to do so. … I want a temple of spirit, a monument!&quot; The resultant achievement, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, in New York City, testifies not only to Wright&#x27;s architectural genius, but also to the adventurous spirit that characterized its founders. The critic Paul Goldberger later wrote that, before Wright&#x27;s modernist building, &quot;there were only two common models for museum design: Beaux-arts Palace ... and the International Style Pavilion.&quot; Goldberger thought the building a catalyst for change, making it &quot;socially and culturally acceptable for an architect to design a highly expressive, intensely personal museum. In this sense almost every museum of our time is a child of the Guggenheim.&quot;

===New York===

Before settling on the present site for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum on Fifth Avenue between 88th and 89th Streets, Wright, Rebay and Guggenheim considered numerous locations in Manhattan, as well as in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, overlooking the Hudson River. Guggenheim felt that the site&#x27;s proximity to Central Park was important; the park afforded relief from the noise, congestion and concrete of the city. Nature also provided the museum with inspiration. The building embodies Wright&#x27;s attempts &quot;to render the inherent plasticity of organic forms in architecture.&quot; The Guggenheim was to be the only museum designed by Wright. The city location required Wright to design the building in a vertical rather than a horizontal form, far different from his earlier, rural works.

Wright&#x27;s original concept was called an inverted &quot;ziggurat&quot;, because it resembled the steep steps on the ziggurats built in ancient Mesopotamia. His design dispensed with the conventional approach to museum layout, in which visitors are led through a series of interconnected rooms and forced to retrace their steps when exiting. Wright&#x27;s plan was for the museum guests to ride to the top of the building by elevator, to descend at a leisurely pace along the gentle slope of the continuous ramp, and to view the atrium of the building as the last work of art. The open rotunda afforded viewers the unique possibility of seeing several bays of work on different levels simultaneously and even to interact with guests on other levels. The spiral design recalled a nautilus shell, with continuous spaces flowing freely one into another.

Even as it embraced nature, Wright&#x27;s design also expresses his take on modernist architecture&#x27;s rigid geometry. Wright ascribed a symbolic meaning to the building&#x27;s shapes. He explained, &quot;these geometric forms suggest certain human ideas, moods, sentiments – as for instance: the circle, infinity; the triangle, structural unity; the spiral, organic progress; the square, integrity.&quot; Forms echo one another throughout: oval-shaped columns, for example, reiterate the geometry of the fountain. Circularity is the leitmotif, from the rotunda to the inlaid design of the terrazzo floors.
Wright&#x27;s vision took 16 years to be fulfilled. Set in sharp contrast to typically rectangular Manhattan buildings that surround it, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum building opened in October 1959. Even before it opened, the design polarized architecture critics. Some believed that the building would overshadow the museum&#x27;s artworks. &quot;On the contrary&quot;, wrote the architect, the design makes &quot;the building and the painting an uninterrupted, beautiful symphony such as never existed in the World of Art before.&quot; Other critics, and many artists, felt that it is awkward to properly hang paintings in the shallow, windowless, concave exhibition niches that surround the central spiral. The building, nevertheless, became widely praised and inspired many other architects.

The building&#x27;s surface was made out of concrete to reduce the cost, inferior to the stone finish that Wright had wanted. The small rotunda (or &quot;Monitor building&quot;, as Wright called it) next to the large rotunda was intended to house apartments for Rebay and Guggenheim but instead became offices and storage space. In 1965, the second floor of the Monitor building was renovated to display the museum&#x27;s growing permanent collection, and with the restoration of the museum in 1990–92, it was turned over entirely to exhibition space and christened the Thannhauser Building, in honor of one of the most important bequests to the museum. Wright&#x27;s original plan for an adjoining tower, artists&#x27; studios and apartments went unrealized, largely for financial reasons. However, as part of the restoration, architects Gwathmey Siegel and Associates analyzed Wright&#x27;s original sketches to design the rectangular 10-story limestone tower, that stands behind, and taller than, the original spiral building (replacing a much smaller structure), which has four additional exhibition galleries with flat walls that are &quot;more appropriate for the display of art.&quot; Also in the original construction, the main gallery skylight had been covered, which compromised Wight&#x27;s carefully articulated lighting effects. This changed in 1992 when the skylight was restored to its original design. Funding for the alterations was raised partly through the controversial sale of masterworks by the foundation in 1991.

In 2001, the museum opened the Sackler Center for Arts Education to the public, which was another part of Wright&#x27;s original design for the building, through a gift of the Mortimer D. Sackler family. Located just below the large rotunda, this 8,200-square-foot education facility provides classes and lectures about the visual and performing arts and opportunities to interact with the museum&#x27;s collections and special exhibitions through its labs, exhibition spaces, conference rooms and the Peter B. Lewis Theater. Between September 2005 and July 2008, the Guggenheim Museum underwent a significant exterior restoration to repair cracks and modernize systems and exterior details. Artist Jenny Holzer painted a tribute, &quot;For the Guggenheim&quot;, in honor of Peter B. Lewis, a major benefactor in the restoration project. The museum was registered as a National Historic Landmark on October 6, 2008.

===Venice===
Peggy Guggenheim purchased the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni in 1948 to house and display her collection to the public, and she resided there for thirty years. Although sometimes mistaken for a modern building, it is an 18th-century palace designed by the Venetian architect Lorenzo Boschetti. The building was unfinished and has an unusually low elevation on the Grand Canal. The museum&#x27;s website describes its &quot;long low façade, made of Istrian stone and set off against the trees in the garden behind that soften its lines, forms a welcome &quot;caesura&quot; in the stately march of Grand Canal palaces from the Accademia to the Salute.&quot;

The Foundation took control of the building in 1979 following Guggenheim&#x27;s death and took steps to expand gallery space. By 1985, &quot;all of the rooms on the main floor had been converted into galleries ... the white Istrian stone facade and the unique canal terrace had been restored&quot;, and a protruding arcade wing, called the barchessa, had been rebuilt by architect Giorgio Bellavitis. Since 1985, the museum has been open year-round. In 1993, the foundation converted apartments adjacent to the museum into a garden annex, a shop and more galleries. In 1995, the Nasher Sculpture Garden was completed, Since 1993, the museum has doubled in size, from 2,000 to 4,000 square meters. and it was renovated in 2012.

===Bilbao===
In 1991, the Basque government suggested to the foundation that it would fund a Guggenheim museum to be built in Bilbao. The foundation selected Frank Gehry as the architect, and its director, Thomas Krens, encouraged him to design something daring and innovative. The curves on the exterior of the building were intended to appear random; the architect said that &quot;the randomness of the curves are designed to catch the light&quot;. The interior &quot;is designed around a large, light-filled atrium with views of Bilbao&#x27;s estuary and the surrounding hills of the Basque country.&quot;

When the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened to the public in 1997, it was immediately hailed as one of the world&#x27;s most spectacular buildings, a masterpiece of the 20th century. Architect Philip Johnson described it as &quot;the greatest building of our time&quot;, while critic Calvin Tomkins, in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, characterized it as &quot;a fantastic dream ship of undulating form in a cloak of titanium&quot;, its brilliantly reflective panels also reminiscent of fish scales. Herbert Muschamp praised its &quot;mercurial brilliance&quot; in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; calls the museum &quot;an astonishing architectural feat&quot;.

The museum is seamlessly integrated into the urban context, unfolding its interconnecting shapes of stone, glass and titanium on a 32,500-square-meter site along the Nervión River in the old industrial heart of the city; while modest from street level, it is most impressive when viewed from the river. Eleven thousand square meters of exhibition space are distributed over nineteen galleries, ten of which follow a classic orthogonal plan that can be identified from the exterior by their stone finishes. The remaining nine galleries are irregularly shaped and can be identified from the outside by their swirling organic forms and titanium cladding. The largest gallery measures 30 meters wide and 130 meters long. Since 2005, it has housed Richard Serra&#x27;s monumental installation &quot;The Matter of Time&quot;.

===Berlin===

Deutsche Guggenheim, in Berlin, opened one month after the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, in 1997. Designed by American architect Richard Gluckman in a minimalist style, the modest Berlin gallery occupied a corner of the ground floor of the sandstone Deutsche Bank building, in the Unter der Linden boulevard, constructed in 1920. It closed in 2013.

===Abu Dhabi===

The museum in Abu Dhabi is planned to be the foundation&#x27;s largest facility by far. Gehry&#x27;s design features exhibition galleries, education and research space, a conservation laboratory, a center for contemporary Arab, Islamic and Middle Eastern culture, and a center for &quot;art and technology&quot;. Inspired by traditional middle-eastern covered courtyards and wind towers, used to cool structures exposed to the desert sun, the museum&#x27;s clusters of horizontal and vertical galleries of various sizes are connected by catwalks and planned around a central, covered courtyard, incorporating natural features intended to maximize the energy efficiency of the building. The largest galleries will offer a grand scale for the display of large contemporary art installations. Parts of the building will be four stories tall, with &quot;clusters of block and cone-shaped connected galleries seemingly piled on top of each other.&quot; The museum is intended to be a centerpiece in the island&#x27;s plan for contemporary art and culture&quot;.

The new museum began construction on a peninsula at the northwestern tip of Saadiyat Island adjacent to Abu Dhabi. Gehry commented, &quot;The site itself, virtually on the water or close to the water on all sides, in a desert landscape with the beautiful sea and the light quality of the place suggested some of the direction.&quot; The completion date was pushed back from 2011 to at least 2017. In March 2011, over 130 artists announced a plan to boycott the Abu Dhabi museum, citing reports of abuses of foreign workers, including the arbitrary withholding of wages, unsafe working conditions and failure of companies to pay recruitment fees to laborers. Continued progress awaits the approval of construction applications and contracts by the Tourism Development &amp; Investment Company (TDIC). As of early 2016, no progress had been made on construction, and the Guggenheim Foundation confirmed that &quot;TDIC has not yet awarded a contract.&quot;

===Helsinki design (never built)===

The Guggenheim Helsinki Design Competition in 2014–2015 was the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation&#x27;s first open, international architectural competition. It received 1,715 submissions from 77 countries, a record for a museum design competition. The design chosen for a proposed €130 million Guggenheim museum in Helsinki, Finland, envisioned &quot;an indistinct jumble of pavilions faced in charred wood&quot; and glass. The winning design was by Paris-based Moreau Kusunoki Architectes. Critics objected to the dark color of the design&#x27;s exterior, which contrasts with the surrounding architecture, as well as the shape of the building. Osku Pajamaki, vice chairman of the city&#x27;s executive board, said: &quot;The symbol of the lighthouse is arrogant in the middle of the historical center ... [like] a Guggenheim museum next to Notre Dame in Paris. People are approaching from the sea, and the first thing that they will see is that the citizens of Helsinki bought their identity from the Guggenheim.&quot; The proposed museum was rejected by the Helsinki city council in 2016.

==Collaborations==

The foundation annually lends hundreds of works of art from its collections to other museums and institutions around the world. It also enters into collaborations with partners throughout the world to engage with diverse audiences and to promote cultural discourse. From 2006 to 2011, exhibitions of the foundation&#x27;s works were seen in more than 80 museums, such as the National Art Museum of China in Beijing during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.

===YouTube Play===
In 2010, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and YouTube, in collaboration with Hewlett-Packard and Intel, presented &quot;YouTube Play, A Biennial of Creative Video&quot;. More than 23,000 videos from 91 countries were submitted in response to an open call for submissions aimed &quot;to discover and showcase the most exceptional talent working in the ever-expanding realm of online video&quot;. Foundation curators selected a short list of 125 videos from which a jury, including artists Laurie Anderson and Takashi Murakami and the musical group Animal Collective, picked a playlist of 25 works. These were featured at the &quot;YouTube Play&quot; event at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York on October 21, 2010, during which the videos were projected on the exterior of the museum building and inside the museum&#x27;s rotunda.

The 25 selected works continued on view at the museum until October 24, 2010. The 125 short list videos were on view throughout the fall of 2010 at kiosks at Guggenheim museums in New York, Berlin, Bilbao and Venice. The project&#x27;s YouTube channel, youtube.com/play, features all of the short list videos, as well as highlights from the event in New York and information about the project. The collaboration was intended to reach wide audiences beyond the museum environment. &quot;New York Times&quot; art critic Roberta Smith commented: &quot;It is an idea whose time has come. ... In many ways it is simply an old-fashioned open-submission exhibition of the kind that regional museums and art centers around the country have staged for decades – except that it has gone digital.&quot;

===BMW Guggenheim Lab===

The BMW Guggenheim Lab is an interdisciplinary travelling project that began in 2011. A collaboration between the BMW Group and the foundation, the lab is part urban think tank, part community center, and part gathering space, which explores issues of urban life through public programming and discourse. The program is designed to proactively engage residents from each city that it visits, and participants on the Internet and from around the world, in free programs and experiments, and to address ideas and issues of urban living with particular relevance to each city. The Lab&#x27;s Advisory Committee of experts nominates each city&#x27;s lab team, an interdisciplinary group that creates the programming for that location. The lab was expected to visit nine cities for three months each over the course of six years, with three different structures housing the lab, each of which was to travel to three cities. In 2013, however, BMW ended its support of the project.

The lab&#x27;s structure was designed by the Tokyo-based architecture firm Atelier Bow-Wow. The project&#x27;s three-city cycle was designed around the theme &quot;Confronting Comfort&quot;, which explored ways of making urban environments more responsive to people&#x27;s needs, striking a balance between individual and collective comfort, and promoting environmental and social responsibility. The Lab&#x27;s Advisory Committee members were: Daniel Barenboim, Elizabeth Diller, Nicholas Humphrey, Muchadeyi Masunda, Enrique Peñalosa, Juliet Schor, Rirkrit Tiravanija, and Wang Shi. The lab was open from August 3 to October 16, 2011, in New York City&#x27;s East Village and was attended by over 54,000 visitors from 60 countries. The Lab was open in Berlin from May 24 to July 29, 2012. The programming of the Berlin Lab focused on four main topics: Empowerment Technologies (Gómez-Márquez), Dynamic Connections (Smith), Urban Micro-Lens (Rose) and the Senseable (SENSEable) City (Ratti). The Lab opened in Mumbai, India, on December 9, 2012, and ran until January 20, 2013. The central location was on the grounds of the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum, with additional satellite locations around the city. Along with neighborhood-specific public programming, the Mumbai Lab program included participatory research studies and design projects.

The program ended with an exhibition, &quot;Participatory City: 100 Urban Trends from the BMW Guggenheim Lab&quot;, which was on view at the New York museum from October 11, 2013, through January 5, 2014.

===Guggenheim UBS MAP Global Art Initiative===

The Guggenheim UBS MAP Global Art Initiative was a five-year program, supported by Swiss bank UBS in which the Foundation identified and worked with artists, curators and educators from Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa to expand its reach in the international art world. For each of the three phases of the project, the museum invited one curator from the chosen region to the Guggenheim Museum in New York City for a two-year curatorial residency to work with a team of Guggenheim staff to identify new artworks that reflect the range of talents in their parts of the world. The resident curators organized international touring exhibitions that highlighted these artworks and helped to organize educational activities. The Foundation acquired these artworks for its permanent collection and included them as the focus of exhibitions at the museum in New York and subsequently traveled to two other cultural institutions or other venues around the world. The Foundation supplemented the exhibitions with a series of public and online programs based on the theme of cross-cultural exchange. UBS reportedly contributed more than $40 million to the project to pay for its activities and the art acquisitions. Foundation director Richard Armstrong commented: &quot;We are hoping to challenge our Western-centric view of art history.&quot;

The first exhibition (phase 1) focused on art from South and Southeast Asia and was curated by Singaporean June Yap, who worked in the curatorial departments of such modern and contemporary art museums as the Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore and the Singapore Art Museum. The second and third phases of the project focused on Latin America and the Middle East and North Africa.

===Robert H.N. Ho Family Foundation===
The Hong Kong-based Robert H.N. Ho Family Foundation (founded by Robert Hung-Ngai Ho) made a $10 million grant to help the New York museum to commission works for its permanent collection by at least three Chinese-born artists and to hire a curator dedicated to its Chinese art collection. The works were to be exhibited at the museum in New York in three exhibitions between 2014 and 2017 and also at the other Guggenheim museums. The commissions were part of an effort by the museum to broaden the geographical scope of its collection, and the Robert H.N. Ho Family Foundation hoped that the collaboration would foster &quot;a greater understanding of Chinese culture.&quot;

<text>HKN, Inc. is a company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration headquartered in Southlake, Texas. It is notable for the Harken Energy scandal, which involved allegations of insider trading by George W. Bush in 1990. The company was known as Harken Energy Corporation until 2007.

==History==
In 1973, the company was founded as an unprofitable collection of Texas oil wells for investors seeking tax write-offs.

In 1986, the company acquired Spectrum 7 for 200,000 shares from George W. Bush. After the sale of his company, Bush served on the board of directors of the company and received $80,000-$100,000 per year in consulting fees. Bush remained on the board through 1993.

In 1987, Talat Othman joined the board of the company and served as the chair of the Audit Committee.

In 1987, Bush obtained a critical $25 million loan from a BCCI joint venture.

In 1989, the company&#x27;s subsidiary Aloha Petroleum was sold to company insiders for $12 million, most of which was borrowed from Harken. The sale of the subsidiary for an exorbitant price helped the company show a profit that year and disguise losses, a similar technique used by Enron that led to the Enron scandal.

In September 1989, the company made an offer to acquire Tesoro Petroleum. The offer was withdrawn in February 1990.

In 2007, the company changed its name to HKN, Inc.

==Controversies==
===Insider trading allegations===

Harken attracted attention because of the role played in its affairs during the 1980s by George W. Bush, later the President of the United States. On June 22, 1990, while he was a member of the company&#x27;s board of directors, Bush sold stock in Harken shortly before the company announced substantial losses. This transaction resulted in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of probable insider trading.

A transaction associated with the financial endowment of Harvard University was also investigated.

===Exploration offshore Costa Rica===
In 2000, a subsidiary of the company received a 20-year concession to exploit resources offshore Costa Rica. After pressure from indigenous tribes and environmentalists, operating as Acción de Lucha Anti-Petrola, the government instituted a moratorium on exploration. In September 2003, the company filed a dispute seeking $57 billion from the government of Costa Rica for lost earnings. The lawsuit was thrown out of court and the concession was revoked.

<text>John III (; 20 December 1537 – 17 November 1592) was King of Sweden from 1569 until his death. He attained the Swedish throne after a rebellion against his half-brother Erik XIV. He is mainly remembered for his attempts to close the gap between the newly established Lutheran Church of Sweden and the Catholic Church, as well as his conflict with and possible murder of his brother.
John was also, quite autonomously, the Duke of Finland from 1556 to 1563. In 1581 he assumed the title Grand Prince of Finland. His first wife was Catherine Jagiellon of the Polish–Lithuanian ruling family, and their son Sigismund eventually ascended both the Polish–Lithuanian and Swedish thrones. He ended the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War, but instead Sweden was drawn into the 25 Years&#x27; War with Russia, where minor gains were eventually made. He worked for closer relations with Poland. John III was interested in religion and culture. During his reign, he countered the growing Lutheran tendencies of the Church of Sweden under the influence of Duke Charles, and worked for a reunion with the Catholic Church and the Pope in Rome.

John III was the son of King Gustav I of Sweden and his second wife Margaret Leijonhufvud. He was the brother of Charles IX and Magnus Vasa and half-brother of Erik XIV. He was married from October 4, 1562 to Catherine Jagiellon (1526-1583), with whom he had a daughter Anna Vasa in addition to Sigismund, and from February 21, 1585 to Gunilla Johansdotter (Bielke) (1568-1597).

==Childhood and adolescence==

John III was born at Stegeborg Castle on December 20, 1537, the son of Gustav I (Vasa) and his second wife, Margareta (Eriksdotter) Leijonhufvud. He was more than once the cause of his father&#x27;s displeasure, especially when, as hereditary Duke of Finland Proper (since June 27, 1556), he sought to interfere in Livonian affairs behind King Gustav&#x27;s back. Gustav had placed his son in Finland to secure Swedish territory in the eastern Baltic from a Russian threat. John also cooperated with his brother Erik, and traveled to London on his behalf, while Erik looked after John&#x27;s interests in Livonia. The marriage would have secured Swedish access to Western Europe. That mission failed, but in England John observed the reintroduction of Protestantism and the Book of Common Prayer (1559). The Finnish duke had liturgical and theological interests.

During this time he also began a relationship with the lady-in-waiting Karin Hansdotter, with whom he lived between 1556 and 1561, and they had four illegitimate children during these years.

===Break with brother Erik===

When John&#x27;s brother Erik XIV became king and held on to royal rights, the brothers soon fell out. As Duke of Finland, he opposed Erik&#x27;s efforts to secure Reval and other East Baltic ports. It was only with the utmost reluctance that John could bring himself to sign the &quot;Articles of Arboga&quot; in 1561, which restricted his power. The break became open when John, against Erik&#x27;s will, married Princess Catherine Jagiellon in Vilnius on October 4, 1562, the younger sister of Poland&#x27;s King Sigismund II Augustus, with whom Erik was at war, and when the two brothers-in-law shortly after the wedding concluded an agreement according to which John would receive from the Polish king as a pledge seven permanent castles in Livonia in return for an advance of 120,000 daler.

Erik considered this agreement to be in direct conflict with the &quot;Articles of Arboga&quot; - which it was - and as soon as he learned of it he demanded that John give up the Livonian castles. When the Duke refused to do so, and even gave an evasive answer to the King&#x27;s demand that he should declare definitely whether he would adhere to Sweden or Poland, he was summoned in April 1563 to appear in Sweden to answer the charge of treasonable designs.

===In captivity===

When the summons was not obeyed by John, he was sentenced in June 1563 by the Estates assembled in Stockholm as guilty of treason, deprived of life, property and hereditary rights to the kingdom. To carry out the sentence, a considerable army was equipped. John, who was unprepared for battle, was locked up in Turku Castle, defended himself there for a few weeks with 1200 men and then surrendered on August 12, 1563, in exchange for the promise of a princely prison (the Siege of Åbo). He was taken to Sweden and imprisoned at Gripsholm Castle, accompanied by his wife. When John and his wife were brought to Gripsholm on a ship, they passed through &quot;Söderport&quot;, where the executions of 30 of John&#x27;s supporters took place. John remained a prisoner for more than four years. However, his imprisonment was relatively light, especially compared to what Erik would later experience; among other things, the couple was able to receive a large shipment of books. John, who was bookish, also spent much of his time studying and conversing with his wife. Their three children were born in captivity, in 1564 Elizabeth, called Isabella, who died at the age of two, in 1566 Sigismund and in May 1568 Anna.

===Free again===

During Erik&#x27;s insanity in the fall of 1567 (see the Sture Murders), John&#x27;s release was secured in October 1567, after which negotiations were begun for the Duke&#x27;s restoration to his rights. 

John further initiated peace talks with Denmark–Norway and Lübeck to end the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War but rejected the resulting Treaties of Roskilde in which his envoys had accepted far-reaching Danish demands. After two more years of fighting, the war was concluded without many Swedish concessions in the Treaty of Stettin. During the following years he successfully fought Russia in the Livonian War, concluded by the Treaty of Plussa in 1583, a war that meant a Swedish reconquest of Narva. As a whole his foreign policy was affected by his connection to Poland of which country his son Sigismund III Vasa was made king in 1587.

However, Erik&#x27;s actions in the first half of 1568 were likely to arouse John&#x27;s fears that his newly won freedom would be taken away from him again. John therefore entered into an agreement with his brother Charles and some of the nobility for a joint rising against Erik&#x27;s hated regiment. This revolt began in July and spread so rapidly that by mid-September the army of the dukes was already outside Stockholm, whose gates were opened to them on 29 September 1568. An important ally was John&#x27;s maternal uncle Sten Leijonhufvud, who was fatally wounded. At deathbed he was made Count of Raseborg. Erik XIV was taken prisoner, and immediately afterwards John had himself hailed as king by the city authorities and by those of the nobility and warriors who were gathered there. Shortly after this John executed his brother&#x27;s most trusted counsellor, Jöran Persson, whom he held largely responsible for his harsh treatment while in prison.

==John III as king==

===Hailed as king===

In January 1569, John III was recognized as king by the same Diet (Riksdag) that forced Erik XIV from the throne. But this recognition was not without concessions on the part of John: Duke Charles was confirmed in his dukedom without the restrictions on his power imposed by the &quot;Articles of Arboga&quot;; the nobility were granted privileges which, in extending their rights and limiting their duties, represent a significant moment in the history of the nobility; and special privileges were granted to the higher nobility which consolidated and developed the distinction between the various classes of the nobility which is of such profound significance in the history of the Swedish nobility.

===Erik dies - John is free===

Although power was now in King John&#x27;s hands, he did not feel secure on his throne as long as his captured half-brother was alive. Three plots were uncovered during these years to depose him: the 1569 Plot, the Mornay Plot, and the 1576 Plot. Fear of his possible release constantly worried the king (compare Erik XIV) and led him, as early as 1571, to order the guards, in the event of the slightest danger of an attempted rescue or the like, to assassinate the captured king, and it was probably as a result of such an order that Erik&#x27;s life was ended in 1577. Even if this was not the case, the fact remains that John did not shrink from the possible murder of his half-brother and that it was not against his will if it was carried out.

===Like his father===

John III often likened himself to his father for propaganda purposes, and in particular he tried to emphasize that while his father had &quot;liberated Sweden&quot; from the &quot;bloodhound&quot; Christian II, he had saved the population from the &quot;tyrannical&quot; Erik XIV, his own brother. He had some similar characteristics to his father and brothers; violent, with a fierce temperament and great suspicion. But he lacked sharpness, firmness, prudence and a practical eye.

===Son far away - Karl supports===

John and his wife Catherine Jagiellon had ensured that their son Sigismund received a Catholic upbringing, probably to help him acquire the Polish crown. This aim was achieved in 1587, and John had thus given Sweden a new union, more unnatural than the one his father had torn apart (the Kalmar Union), as Sweden and Poland often had directly conflicting interests in the Baltic. He also soon came to regret his decision and vainly demanded the return of Sigismund to Sweden, which the high nobility opposed as they foresaw that this would lead to war with Poland, something Sweden after 28 years of war would find difficult to cope with.

John responded with a political shake-up; instead of relying on the council aristocracy as before, he now sought the assistance of his brother Duke Charles, with whom he had been at bitter odds for most of his previous reign. The reasons for this had been many, but one of the most important had been that John III, as king, had sought to apply the same principles with regard to royal rights within Charles&#x27;s principality that he had so ardently opposed as duke. In 1587 he had finally succeeded in persuading his brother to approve statutes very similar to the &quot;Articles of Arboga&quot;, which he himself had repealed in 1569, but judging from a proposal in 1590 for a new arrangement of the princely rights, he gave up the claims he had previously stubbornly maintained after the break with the high nobility.

===Alone at last===

Even John&#x27;s newfound friendship with his brother Charles soon cooled, however, and for the last few months of his life John was completely alone. In the spring of 1592, he fell ill with a fever that made him very anxious. He hoped to get better by moving to a pleasure garden he had built on Skeppsholmen, where he thought the air was healthier than in the city. But there was no improvement, and in high summer the condition worsened. 

John died in Stockholm on November 17, 1592, leaving his kingdom weakened by external and internal strife, in disorder and neglect, and for the immediate future threatened by the greatest dangers. John III is buried in Uppsala Cathedral.

As king, John was oriented towards the Baltic, aiming to take control of the rich trade on Russia. After ending the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1570 and making peace with Denmark and Lübeck, he went to war with Russia. This war lasted with varying intensity until 1595. The capture of Narva in 1581 was his greatest military success.

==Church policy==

John&#x27;s relations with the Church were initially good, although Archbishop Laurentius Petri hesitated for a long time before sanctioning the rebellion. In domestic politics, John showed clear Catholic sympathies inspired by his Polish wife, a fact that created frictions to the Swedish clergy and nobility. However, the Archbishop soon had his new Church Order ratified, which he had already drawn up in outline during the reign of King Gustav, but had not obtained his approval. This Church Order emphasized continuity with older traditions. It also restored the medieval ecclesiastical organization, with essentially the same dioceses. In 1575, he gave his permission for the remaining Catholic convents in Sweden to start receiving novices again. 

All of this can be seen as an expression of the mediating theology that John was strongly influenced by, aimed at reducing the contradictions between the various rival faiths that were tearing Europe apart at the time. However, John himself was a learned follower of the mediating theologian George Cassander. He sought reconciliation between Rome and Wittenberg on the basis of the consensus of the first five centuries of Christianity ().

John was far from alone in listening to this message; both the Polish king Sigismund II Augustus and the emperors Ferdinand I and Maximilian II, who had multiple faiths in their empires, were also sensitive to it. John approved the publication of the Lutheran &quot;Swedish Church Order&quot; of Archbishop Laurentius Petri in 1571 but also got the church to approve an addendum to the church order in 1575, that displayed a return to patristic sources.

===&quot;The Red Book&quot;===

This set the stage for John&#x27;s promulgation of the Swedish-Latin &quot;Red Book&quot;, entitled &quot;Liturgia suecanae ecclesiae catholicae &amp; orthodoxae conformis&quot;, which reintroduced several Catholic customs and resulted in the Liturgical Struggle, which lasted for twenty years, and attempts to negotiate with the Pope, which failed completely, partly because John&#x27;s confidant in these matters, Peter Fecht, drowned during his trip to the Holy See in Rome. He also sought to enlist the help of the papacy in gaining release of his wife&#x27;s family assets, which were frozen in Naples. Furthermore, he allowed Jesuits to secretly staff the Royal Theological College in Stockholm. 

From time to time, John was also at odds theologically with his younger brother Duke Charles of Sudermannia (afterwards Charles IX of Sweden), who had Calvinist sympathies, and did not promote King John&#x27;s Liturgy in his duchy. This was expressed, for example, in the &quot;Örebro Articles&quot;, where priests in Duke Karl&#x27;s duchy distanced themselves from the new order of worship. However, John also had support for his church policy, including from Ingelbertus Olai Helsingus and Erasmus Nicolai Arbogensis.

==Favoring the nobility==

John owed his crown primarily to his brother Charles and the nobility. At his coronation, he therefore rewarded this social class with special privileges that no longer required any obligations to the crown. When King Magnus Ladulås granted tax exemption, it was in return for an obligation, namely to provide horsemen. The majority of the &quot;frälse-men&quot; were actually wealthy peasants, lived much like them and were counted as commoners. Before John&#x27;s time, it had been customary for the &quot;frälse&quot; who could no longer afford to fulfill their army service obligation to descend to the peasantry again.

John&#x27;s noble privileges began to blur the line between the &quot;frälse&quot; and the commoners. They meant that nobles who were too poor to serve in the army could still retain a noble shield. John also appointed new counts and barons and granted large estates in land, called countships and baronies. These were to be inherited by the nearest male heir. During the reign of Erik XIV, only the counts had been given estates, and these were small. Now the counties were increased by up to 20 parishes. The counts were given jurisdiction over the county&#x27;s population.

==John III - the builder==

John III was very interested in art, especially architecture. He was undoubtedly the most building-minded monarch Sweden ever had. Like his brother Erik, he was highly artistic and aesthetically gifted. However, his sense of beauty found its most obvious expression in the field of architecture. He spent a lot of time drawing up elaborate plans for buildings, only a small part of which were realized during his lifetime.

&quot;Building is our highest desire&quot;, writes John himself in one of many letters in which he gives orders to his architects and builders.

===Foreign expertise called in===

John called in skilled builders, sculptors and painters from Germany and the Netherlands and also intervened himself, through his own drawings, in the prolific building activity that he provoked in so many places. His surviving letters on building also show that he understood architecture and that he was familiar with the principles of the Italian Renaissance, specifically the High and Late Renaissance. In his letters he advises and admonishes his architects and builders, he corrects their drawings and revels in the details of architecture and decoration. Above all, his interest is focused on the decoration itself: in the exterior on magnificent portals and windows, ornate gables and richly decorated spires, in the interior especially on the rich paneling and door frames.

In particular, Sebastiano Serlio&#x27;s books on the art of building seem to have been a frequent source of inspiration. John&#x27;s own taste therefore came to assert itself in many ways, and he may justly be regarded as the center of the interesting art movement which arose during his reign.

In the large circle of artists and craftsmen around John III there were some more prominent, such as the Swede Anders målare (&quot;Anders Painter&quot;), mostly active as a builder, Willem Boy, important both as a sculptor and architect (creator of John&#x27;s tomb in Uppsala), Vadstena architects Arendt de Roy and Hans Fleming.

But John needed more skilled people. Among the foreign masters he employed were the three members of the Pahr family of architects, originally from Lombardy, Franciscus Pahr, Johan Baptista Pahr and Dominicus Pahr, the former of whom had his name attached to Uppsala, the latter two to Borgholm and Kalmar castles, the stucco artist and master builder Antonius Watz, the chief builder of Finland and Livonia Peter Hertig, the carvers Markus Wulfrum and Urban Schultz, the painters Johan Baptista van Uther and Arent Lambrechts, the stonemasons and sculptors Roland Mackle, Peter de la Koche, Lukas van der Werdt and others. Experts from abroad were also called in to help with agricultural matters, including foresters from the German principalities and Denmark.

===Churches and monasteries===

A particular aspect of John III&#x27;s interest in building is his concern for the preservation of older monumental buildings. His zeal also extended to care for the appearance of cities. The cathedrals of Uppsala, Västerås, Linköping and Skara were restored to their former glory; in Finland, Turku Cathedral was restored and given a new chancel; in Estonia, Reval (Tallinn) was restored. Among the more or less destroyed monastery churches that were renovated are Varnhem, Vreta Abbey, Alvastra, Askeby and Gudhem, and Naantali in Finland. In Stockholm, Storkyrkan, Riddarholmen Church and The German Church (originally a medieval guildhall which, since it was also given to the Finnish congregation, was long called Saint Henry&#x27;s church) were restored, while The Church of Saint Clare was built on the site of St. Clare&#x27;s Priory, which had been demolished by Gustav I. Another new building was St. James&#x27; Church. Other churches he planned, such as a Trinity Church, were never built.

===Castles and fortresses===

John III built chapels in all his major castles, with Vadstena Castle partially preserved and Kalmar Castle still well preserved. In this ecclesiastical building activity, the Gothic traditions, even in detail, lived on. The many castle and fortress projects were partly inherited from the time of Gustav I and Erik XIV, and partly started by John III. The Tre Kronor Palace in Stockholm was significantly extended and redecorated. The northern courtyard, including the castle church, was given the character it retained until the Castle Fire in 1697.

The castle in Uppsala (the present southern part and its western extension) was rebuilt after the fire of 1572 as a brick building with rusticated plaster and two round towers. Vadstena Castle, like the previous one founded by Gustav I, was expanded into the Renaissance palace it still is today, although it was not completed according to the original plan until the early 17th century. Svartsjö Palace was a curious building, with its circular arcaded courtyard and domed church on either side of an older stone house.

At Kalmar Castle, where John often resided there because it was closer to Poland, the perimeter of the courtyard was completed, the floors were laid out on the same level, and in the interior the costly decoration begun under Erik XIV was continued. Borgholm Castle, on the other hand, was Johan III&#x27;s largest new building, with a completely regular plan, outstanding spaciousness and magnificence, and strong fortifications, but it was not completed during Johan III&#x27;s reign. Another new building was Bråborg Castle, intended as a widow&#x27;s seat for Queen Gunilla, while Drottningholm (the older one, burnt down in 1661) was built on one of the islands of Lake Mälaren at the request of Catherine Jagiellon.

The rebuilding of Turku Castle, Västerås Castle, Gävle Castle, Stegeborg Castle and Linköping Castle can also be mentioned. Fortifications were present at almost all the castles. More purely as fortresses were Älvsborg, Gullberg, Kronoberg Castle, Kexholm, Vyborg and other places, at which significant fortification work was often undertaken, followed with interest by the king. In the art of fortification, Sweden was at this time at the forefront of the Nordic countries, because the new Italian system had been introduced by the Pahr brothers.

===Monuments===

Among monumental works of sculpture, the most noteworthy are the funerary monuments of his father Gustav I and his first two wives, and the beautiful tomb of Catherine Jagiellon, both in Uppsala Cathedral. The monument to John III on the said site was commissioned by his son Sigismund in Danzig (from the sculptor Willem van den Blocke), but only came to Sweden in 1782 through Gustav III&#x27;s care and was erected in its present location in 1818, albeit with an incorrect arrangement, which was however redesigned by Agi Lindegren during the church&#x27;s restoration in the early 1890s.

==Legacy==

The Finnish city of Pori uses &quot;Deus Protector Noster&quot; (John III&#x27;s motto) as its motto. A statue of Duke John was unveiled in front of Pori Town Hall in 2008, 450 years after the city was founded by him.

==Family==
John married his first wife, Catherine Jagiellon of Poland (1526–83), of the House of Jagiellon, in Vilnius on 4 October 1562. In Sweden, she is known as &quot;Katarina Jagellonica&quot;. She was the sister of king Sigismund II Augustus of Poland. 

John married his second wife, Gunilla Bielke (1568–1592), on 21 February 1585; they had a son. 

With his mistress Karin Hansdotter (1532–1596) he had at least four illegitimate children. John cared for Karin and their children even after he married Catherine Jagiellon, in 1562. He found Karin a husband who would care for her and the children. In 1561, she married nobleman Klas Andersson (Westgöthe), a friend and servant of John. They had a daughter named Brita. 

John continued supporting Karin and his illegitimate children as king, from 1568. In 1572 Karin married again, as her first husband was executed for treason by Erik XIV in 1563, to a Lars Henrikson, whom John ennobled in 1576 to care for his issue with Karin. The same year, he made his daughter Sofia a lady in the castle, as a servant to his sister Princess Elizabeth of Sweden. In 1580, John married her to Pontus De la Gardie. She later died giving birth to Jacob De la Gardie.

<text>The Harken Energy Scandal refers to a series of transactions entered into during 1990 involving [[Harken Energy]]. These transactions are alleged to involve either issues relating to insider trading, or influence peddling. Although no wrongdoings were found by any investigating authorities, the matter generated political controversy.

==Spectrum 7 purchase==
George W. Bush ran an energy company called Spectrum 7 during the 1980s. In the mid-1980s the oil market was in a slump, with prices dropping daily. The firm was in financial trouble until another company, a distressed oil properties specialist, Harken Energy, purchased Spectrum 7 in 1986. Part of the attraction for Harken&#x27;s management to purchase Spectrum 7 was having Bush on its board — his father was then vice-president, he had extensive political connections and knowledge of the oil and gas business. Harken Energy offered Bush a seat on its board of directors along with stock worth about $500,000 at the time. Bush received a consulting contract worth between $80,000 and $120,000 annually as well.

==The Job==
In 1987 and 1988, George W. Bush dedicated himself (and much of his efforts) to the presidential campaign of his father George H. W. Bush. Fortunes turned for Bush, and the following year he invested in the Texas Rangers baseball team. To help pay for this investment, he borrowed a sum of $600,000; to pay off the loan, he sold his stock in Harken Energy. That investment paid off handsomely for him, not only monetarily. As team owner, the popularity derived from his public persona lead to the invitation to run for governor of Texas and ultimately, two terms as president.

==Bush&#x27;s stock sale and its consequences for Harken Energy==
George W. Bush sold 212,140 shares of Harken Energy at $4 a share on June 22, 1990, for a grand total of $848,560. Two months later, on August 20, Harken announced a larger than expected loss for the previous quarter. Surprisingly, the price of the company&#x27;s stock shares barely declined at first, following these two negative, or &quot;bearish&quot;, events. In the ensuing months, Harken&#x27;s stock price did drift downward to $1.25 per share by the end of the year. However, the stock price then recovered its value and more the following year, which was strange behavior for the stock. The sale of the large block of shares had become widely publicized and allegations of the use of insider information, and improper stock transactions, were leveled at Bush.

===SEC investigation===
The SEC&#x27;s exhaustive investigation examined thousands of pages of documents. Additionally, and in an unusual move, Bush waived client-attorney privileges so the attorneys could be questioned, in order to leave no remaining doubts on the subject. Regarding whether Bush knew in advance about the losses, the SEC investigators found: &quot;The evidence establishes that George W. Bush was not aware of the majority of the items that comprised the loss Harken announced on August 20.&quot; The SEC investigators concluded that the loss resulted from write-downs and expenses that occurred after he sold his stock. Basically an outsider, Bush did not usually receive the Executive Committee&#x27;s Weekly Flash Reports on the company&#x27;s financial condition. In short, concluded an SEC investigative memo, George W. Bush was not particularly informed about the company&#x27;s finances.

Regarding whether the stock was sold deliberately in time to avoid losing money before bad news was made public, the SEC found that Bush did not initiate the sale, but was contacted by a stockbroker who offered to buy a large block of Harken stock. There was evidence that before selling the stock, company board member Bush checked with inside and outside company executives, fellow directors and legal experts concerning the sale of his stock. The SEC report read, &quot;In light of the facts uncovered, it would be difficult to establish that, even assuming Bush possessed material nonpublic information, he acted with sentience or intent to defraud.&quot;

Whether the news of Harken&#x27;s unexpectedly large loss hurt the company&#x27;s investors unfairly was quickly discarded after the SEC examined Harken Energy&#x27;s share price just before and just after news of the loss was made public. Though the price dropped about 20% that day, the move downward was not immediate, and the price rebounded to $3 the following day. If indeed the announcement had caused a loss of confidence in the company, SEC investigators reasoned, the stock would most likely have fallen immediately and stayed down. &quot;The conclusion of the Office of Economic Analysis is that, because the price of Harken did not immediately react to the earnings announcement and there is no news that explains Harken&#x27;s return to its pre-announcement price of $3 on August 21, 1990, the earnings announcement did not provide investors with new material information,&quot; the SEC wrote. Moreover, the stock rebounded the next year and hit $8 a share.

==Formal troubles==
There are also questions about when federal regulators were informed of the sale, and whether Bush tried to hide this information. Newspapers have alleged that though the law requires prompt disclosure of insider sales, Bush neglected to inform the SEC about his transaction until 34 weeks had passed. Even though he had broken the law, no charges were filed. Many have linked this to his father&#x27;s position as president.

The reality of the matter is somewhat different. Although these articles usually do not mention it, only one of the two disclosure forms Bush was required to file with the SEC was delayed in its filing. The &quot;Notice of Proposed Sale of Securities&quot; Form 144, was filed on the day of the sale, June 22, 1990, thereby clearing Bush of the intent to hide or not disclose. Bush filed the second form, Form 4, the following year, in 1991, due to &quot;a mix up with the attorneys&quot;. Because the stock sale information had indeed been disclosed, and duly filed in a timely manner via Form 144, the tardy filing of Form 4 was not viewed as a serious or punishable offense. It appears that the late filing of Form 4 was not considered serious by the SEC at the time.

==Conclusion==
Bush was cleared of any wrongdoing. The Center for Public Integrity said of this episode - &quot;The documents from the SEC inquiry show that Harken Energy engaged in questionable accounting practices as they attempted to stave off a financial crisis in 1989 and 1990. They also show that [George W.] Bush was unaware of much of what was going on in the company. Ultimately, the SEC required the company to correct its financial reports, but concluded there was insufficient evidence to pursue an insider trading case against Bush.&quot;

<text>The Moral Majority was an American political organization and movement associated with the Christian right and the Republican Party in the United States. It was founded in 1979 by Baptist minister Jerry Falwell Sr. and associates, and dissolved in the late 1980s. It played a key role in the mobilization of conservative Christians as a political force and particularly in Republican presidential victories throughout the 1980s.

==History==

===Before establishment===
The origins of the Moral Majority can be traced to 1976 when Baptist minister Jerry Falwell Sr. embarked on a series of &quot;I Love America&quot; rallies across the country to raise awareness of social issues important to him. These rallies were an extension of Falwell&#x27;s decision to go against the traditional Baptist principle of separating religion and politics, a change of heart Falwell says he had when he perceived what he described as the decay of the nation&#x27;s morality. Through hosting these rallies, Falwell was able to gauge national support for a formal organization and also raise his profile as a leader. Having already been a part of a well-established network of ministers and ministries, within a few years Falwell was favorably positioned to launch the Moral Majority.

The impetus for the Moral Majority was the struggle for control of an American conservative Christian advocacy group known as Christian Voice during 1978. Robert Grant, Christian Voice&#x27;s president, said in a news conference that the religious right was a &quot;sham... controlled by three Catholics and a Jew.&quot; Following this, Paul Weyrich, Terry Dolan, Richard Viguerie (the Catholics) and Howard Phillips (the Jew) left Christian Voice.

During a 1979 meeting, they urged televangelist Jerry Falwell Sr. to found the Moral Majority (a phrase coined by Weyrich). This was the period when the New Christian Right arose. Joining Falwell in the Moral Majority was Ed McAteer, who the same year, founded the Religious Roundtable in Memphis, Tennessee. Falwell also brought in Tim LaHaye, leader of a clergy group opposed to gay rights and John Birch Society figure, as an organizer.

===Establishment and organizational activity===
Falwell and Weyrich founded the Moral Majority in June 1979. According to former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who was Texas evangelist James Robison&#x27;s communications director at the time, Robison&#x27;s &quot;Freedom Rally&quot; at the Dallas Convention Center was the genesis of the Moral Majority.

The Moral Majority was predominately a Southern-oriented organization of the Christian Right, although its state chapters and political activity extended beyond the South. The number of state chapters grew quickly, with organizations in eighteen states by 1980. The variety of resources available to the Moral Majority at its founding facilitated this rapid expansion, and included Falwell&#x27;s mailing list from his program, &quot;Old Time Gospel Hour&quot;. In addition, the Moral Majority took control of the &quot;Old Time Gospel Hour&quot; publication, &quot;Journal Champion&quot;, which had been distributed to the show&#x27;s donors. Through the 1980s, Falwell was the organization&#x27;s best-known spokesperson. By 1982, Moral Majority surpassed Christian Voice in size and influence.

The Moral Majority&#x27;s headquarters were in Lynchburg, Virginia, where Falwell was the presiding minister of the nation&#x27;s largest independent Baptist church, Thomas Road Baptist Church. Virginia has been a seat of Christian Right politics, being the state where the Christian Coalition&#x27;s first headquarters were established. Falwell was at the head of the Moral Majority and maintained an advisory board, constituting the organization&#x27;s primary leadership. This leadership was drawn mostly from Falwell&#x27;s fellow members of the Baptist Bible Fellowship. Falwell insisted the Moral Majority leadership also include Catholics and Jews, although not all members of the leadership approved of this inclusion.

The Moral Majority was an organization made up of conservative Christian political action committees which campaigned on issues its personnel believed were important to maintaining its Christian conception of moral law. They believed this represented the opinions of the majority of Americans (hence the movement&#x27;s name). With a membership of millions, the Moral Majority became one of the largest conservative lobby groups in the United States and at its height, it claimed more than four million members and over two million donors. These members were spread among about twenty state organizations, of which Washington State&#x27;s was the largest. The Moral Majority was incorporated into the Liberty Federation in 1985, remaining a distinct entity but falling under the Liberty Federation&#x27;s larger jurisdiction. In 1987, Falwell retired as the formal head of the Moral Majority, and was succeeded by Jerry Nims, although he maintained an active and visible role within the organization. The same year, a major effort which Falwell made to bring scandal-ridden Jim Bakker&#x27;s PTL ministries out of financial trouble proved unsuccessful.

===Dissolution===
By the end of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential administration, Christian Right organizations were generally in a phase of decline. After Reagan&#x27;s two terms in office, donations were decreasing, because after eight years of Christian Right-supported leadership, the nation was no longer seen as in the same state of supposed moral peril as it was when Reagan first took office. The Moral Majority&#x27;s financial base seriously eroded by the time it became part of the Liberty Federation; its financial difficulties ultimately were a major factor in the decision to disband the organization. Falwell offered an optimistic public opinion about the Moral Majority&#x27;s dissolution. Disbanding the Moral Majority in 1989 in Las Vegas, Falwell declared, &quot;Our goal has been achieved... The religious right is solidly in place and[...] religious conservatives in America are now in for the duration.&quot;

==Organizational goals and composition==
The Moral Majority sought to mobilize conservative Americans to become politically active on issues they thought were important. A variety of tactics were used to garner support. These tactics included direct-mail campaigns, telephone hotlines, rallies, and religious television broadcasts. Although the Moral Majority operated for only a decade, it rapidly became a visible political force and was relatively effective in its mobilization goals. According to Robert Liebman and Robert Wuthnow, common explanations for this success include:

* The Moral Majority was founded with strong financial backing already in place.
* Its leaders frequently communicated with its constituents, enabling consistent messages to resonate throughout all levels.
* Its leaders generally had previous organizational and management experience.
* The general public was amenable to the issues the Moral Majority emphasized.
Scholar Carmen Celestini argues that the culture war issues, conspiratorialism, apocalypticism, and fear emphasized in the John Birch Society were key aspects in the successful mobilization of the Moral Majority, particularly through Tim LaHaye, a Moral Majority figure and John Birch Society member and speaker.

Some issues for which the Moral Majority campaigned included:
* Promotion of traditional family values
* Opposition to media outlets accused of promoting an anti-family agenda
* Opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment and Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
* Opposition to state recognition or acceptance of homosexual acts
* Prohibition of abortion, including in cases involving incest or rape
* Support for Christian prayers in schools
* Proselytising to Jews and other non-Christians for conversion to Christianity

===Social agenda===

The Moral Majority successfully campaigned to create an integrated social platform that appealed to most conservative Christians by packaging a variety of previously disparate issues under the banner of &quot;traditional family values&quot;. The Moral Majority portrayed issues such as abortion, divorce, feminism, gay and lesbian rights, and the Equal Rights Amendment as attacks on the traditional concept and values of American families and tapped into a sense of societal moral decay that resonated with many evangelicals. They also campaigned for the inclusion of prayer in schools and tax incentives for married couples as protection for the traditional family structure. Under this pro-family agenda, they mobilized a large base of supporters with issue-centric dialogue that they proliferated in their network of preachers and mailings.

====Gay rights issues==== 
In particular, the anti-homosexual rhetoric that they publicized through fundraising letters and Christian broadcasting had higher contribution rates than other topics. While not explicitly anti-gay in their public platforms during the 1970s, their internal mobilization as &quot;shared anti-gay sentiment aided in solidifying a collective set of grievances and ideologies, in establishing a collective identity of constituents, and in constructing a hostile enemy against which the conservative Christian activists were to fight&quot;. The Moral Majority refrained from directly speaking out against gays, feminists, and pro-abortion parties and instead used &quot;pro-family&quot; rhetoric to articulate their point. For example, instead of coming out directly against homosexuality and gay families, leaders of the Moral Majority defined a family as &quot;two heterosexual parents&quot;, which appealed to many conservatives.

Later, as the organization gained more influence in the 1980s, their rhetoric became more explicit in their stance on gay rights as they characterized the movement as an attack on the American family. Jerry Falwell Sr. expressed that because gay people were rejected by most of society, they had no choice but to prey on the young and were therefore a threat to children and families. Various Moral Majority members also expressed more extreme opinions, such as Moral Majority commentator Charlie Judd, who argued that &quot;There are absolutes in this world. Just as jumping off a building will kill a person, so will the spread of homosexuality bring about the demise of American culture as we know it&quot;.

==Organizational structure==
The Moral Majority comprised four distinct organizations:

* Moral Majority Inc. – the organization&#x27;s lobbying division, which addressed issues on local, state, and national levels.
* Moral Majority Foundation – the organization&#x27;s educational component, through which the Moral Majority educated ministers and lay people on political issues and conducted voter registration drives.
* Moral Majority Legal Defense Fund – the organization&#x27;s legal instrument, used primarily to challenge the American Civil Liberties Union and secular humanist issues in court.
* Moral Majority Political Action Committee – the organization&#x27;s mechanism for supporting the candidacy of people whose political platforms reflected Moral Majority values.

The state chapters of the Moral Majority were financially independent from the national organization and relied on local resources to conduct their activities. Consequently, the national organization encouraged local chapters to cooperate with their policies but had little control over local chapters&#x27; activities. Political activity of the Moral Majority divided accordingly, with the national Moral Majority office usually focused on addressing multiple issues through Congress while local branches tended to work on a single issue within their respective states.

==Political involvement==
The Moral Majority engaged in political activity in a variety of ways, including national media campaigns and grassroots organization aimed at supporting particular candidates in elections and using mail and phone calls to reach office-holders. The Moral Majority&#x27;s initial political actions were aimed at supporting Jesse Helms&#x27; proposed legislation on school prayer. Before long, the Moral Majority became heavily invested in presidential elections and national politics; although at the state level branches of the Moral Majority continued to pursue specific issues at lower levels of government. As far as elections, state Moral Majority chapters tended to deliberately focus their efforts towards particular candidates. For example, state chapters participated in campaigns to oust liberal members of Congress during the 1980 election. Also, in 1981, the Moral Majority mobilized delegates to the Virginia Republican state nominating convention in order to support Guy Farley, an evangelical candidate for lieutenant governor.

Nationally, the Moral Majority encouraged electoral participation among its members and used registration drives to register church-goers to vote, with the logic that Moral Majority members would be likely to vote for Moral Majority-endorsed candidates, thus strengthening the organization&#x27;s electoral efficacy and strengthening its endorsements. Leaders within the Moral Majority asked ministers give their congregants political direction, reminding congregants when to vote, whom to vote for, and why the Moral Majority held particular positions on issues. The Moral Majority, however, is probably best known for its involvement in presidential elections, specifically those of Ronald Reagan.

===Presidential elections===
The 1976 election of Jimmy Carter as President of the United States marked a milestone for evangelical Christians. For the first time, a self-professed evangelical Christian had been elected to the nation&#x27;s highest office, bringing the national awareness of evangelical Christianity to a new level. Despite commonality in religious identification, however, evangelical Christians in general and eventually the newly formed Moral Majority in particular came to be disappointed with Carter&#x27;s policies. Carter did not share the Moral Majority&#x27;s political imperative to unify personal and political positions and would instead support the positions of his own party, the Democratic Party. In particular, Carter did not actively oppose his party&#x27;s general pro-choice platform on abortion, nor did Carter work to bridge the church–state divide, both factors in the Moral Majority&#x27;s decision to support Ronald Reagan&#x27;s candidacy in 1980.

====1980====
The Moral Majority was a relatively early supporter of Reagan, endorsing him before the Republican convention. According to Jimmy Carter, &quot;that autumn [1980] a group headed by Jerry Falwell purchased $10 million in commercials on southern radio and TV to brand me as a traitor to the South and no longer a Christian.&quot; Naturally, the Moral Majority continued working on behalf of Reagan after he gained the Republican nomination. Following the organization&#x27;s lead, more than one-fifth of Moral Majority supporters that had supported Carter in 1976 voted for Reagan in 1980. After Reagan&#x27;s victory, Falwell attributed Reagan&#x27;s success directly to the Moral Majority and others registering and encouraging church-goers to vote who had never before been politically active. Empirical evidence suggests that Falwell&#x27;s claim about the role of Christian Right organizations in Reagan&#x27;s victory has some truth, though difficult to determine definitively.

Reagan sought input from the Moral Majority leadership during his campaign and appointed the Rev. Robert Billings, the Moral Majority&#x27;s first executive director, to be a religious advisor to the campaign. Later, Reagan appointed Billings to a position in the Department of Education. This appointment was particularly significant for the Moral Majority, which had lobbied on education policy issues, especially those regarding private schools.

====1984====
The Moral Majority maintained their support for Reagan&#x27;s 1984 reelection campaign and, alongside other Christian Right organizations, influenced the Republican platform for the election, shaping the party&#x27;s campaign stances on school prayer and abortion. The nation&#x27;s political climate, however, had changed since Reagan&#x27;s first campaign. Although Reagan won reelection, the role of the Moral Majority in the victory had changed since 1980. A study of voters in the 1984 election showed that more anti-Moral Majority voters voted for Walter Mondale than pro-Moral Majority voters voted for Reagan, suggesting the Moral Majority may have actually had a negative effect on Reagan&#x27;s campaign.

====1988====
1988 was the last presidential election for which the Moral Majority was an active organization. With Reagan having reached his two-term limit, the Republican nomination was open to a variety of primary contenders. The evangelical minister and televangelist Pat Robertson sought the Republican nomination and would have been, at first glance, a natural choice for the Moral Majority&#x27;s support. Although Robertson&#x27;s political platforms were extremely similar to the ones the Moral Majority supported, Falwell gave his organization&#x27;s endorsement to contender George H. W. Bush instead. Falwell&#x27;s decision highlighted the rivalry between Falwell and Robertson as televangelists but also revealed the deep-seated tension that still persisted between competing evangelical traditions – Falwell&#x27;s fundamentalist tradition was at odds with Robertson&#x27;s charismatic tradition.

==Challenges to the Moral Majority==
By 1987–88, the views of the Moral Majority were challenged widely and the organization started to crumble. With its waning support, critics said &quot;The Moral Majority is neither&quot;, meaning the organization was neither moral nor a majority. By 1988, there were serious cash flow problems and Falwell dismantled the organization in 1989.

=== Bob Jones ===
During its existence the Moral Majority experienced friction with other evangelical leaders and organizations as well as liberal leaders and organizations. For example, Bob Jones particularly sought to challenge the public position of the Moral Majority and was known to make public statements that the Moral Majority was an instrument of Satan, due to Falwell’s abandonment of strict separatism and willingness to collaborate with Catholics and Orthodox Jews. Such rivalries affected the Moral Majority&#x27;s grassroots efforts. In South Carolina, the Moral Majority had no presence because Bob Jones University&#x27;s religious network had already organized the state&#x27;s independent Baptists. The tension between Falwell and Pat Robertson also affected the Moral Majority.

=== Norman Lear ===
On the ideologically opposed side, Norman Lear&#x27;s liberal organization People for the American Way was formed with the specific intention of opposing the platforms of the Moral Majority and other Christian Right organizations.

==Moral Majority Coalition==
In November 2004, Falwell revived the Moral Majority name for a new organization, the Moral Majority Coalition. The intent of the organization is to continue the &quot;evangelical revolution&quot; to help conservative politicians get elected. Referring to the Coalition as a &quot;21st century resurrection of the Moral Majority,&quot; Falwell, a father of the modern &quot;religious right&quot; political movement, committed to leading the organization for four years. He died on May 15, 2007.

<text>George Brinton McClellan (December 3, 1826 – October 29, 1885) was an American military officer and politician who served as the 24th governor of New Jersey and as Commanding General of the United States Army from November 1861 to March 1862. He was also an engineer, and was chief engineer and vice president of the Illinois Central Railroad, and later president of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad in 1860. 

A West Point graduate, McClellan served with distinction during the Mexican–American War. He was a railway executive and engineer until the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. Early in the conflict, McClellan was appointed to the rank of major general and played an important role in raising the Army of the Potomac, which served in the Eastern Theater.

McClellan organized and led the Union Army in the Peninsula campaign in southeastern Virginia from March through July 1862. It was the first large-scale offensive in the Eastern Theater. Making an amphibious clockwise turning movement around the Confederate Army in northern Virginia, McClellan&#x27;s forces turned west to move up the Virginia Peninsula, between the James River and York River, landing from Chesapeake Bay, with the Confederate capital, Richmond, as their objective. Initially, McClellan was somewhat successful against General Joseph E. Johnston, but the emergence of General Robert E. Lee to command the Army of Northern Virginia turned the subsequent Seven Days Battles into a Union defeat. However, historians note that Lee&#x27;s victory was in many ways pyrrhic as he failed to destroy the Army of the Potomac and suffered a bloody repulse at Malvern Hill.

McClellan and President Abraham Lincoln developed a mutual distrust, and McClellan was privately derisive of Lincoln. He was removed from command in November, in the aftermath of the 1862 midterm elections. A major contributing factor in this decision was McClellan&#x27;s failure to pursue Lee&#x27;s army following the tactically inconclusive but strategic Union victory at the Battle of Antietam outside Sharpsburg, Maryland. He never received another field command and went on to become the unsuccessful Democratic Party nominee in the 1864 presidential election against the Republican Lincoln. The effectiveness of his campaign was damaged when McClellan repudiated his party&#x27;s platform, which promised an end to the war and negotiations with the Confederacy. He served as the governor of New Jersey from 1878 to 1881; in McClellan&#x27;s later writings, he vigorously defended his Civil War conduct.

==Early life and education==

McClellan was born in Philadelphia on December 3, 1826, the son of a prominent surgeon, George McClellan, the founder of Jefferson Medical College. His father&#x27;s family was of Scottish and English heritage. His mother was Elizabeth Sophia Steinmetz Brinton McClellan, daughter of a leading Pennsylvania family, a woman noted for her &quot;considerable grace and refinement.&quot; Her father was of English origin, while her mother was Pennsylvania Dutch. The couple had five children: Frederica, John, George, Arthur, and Mary. One of McClellan&#x27;s great-grandfathers was Samuel McClellan, a brigadier general who served during the Revolutionary War.

McClellan initially intended to follow his father into the medical profession, and attended a private academy, which was followed by enrollment in a private preparatory school for the University of Pennsylvania. He began attending the university in 1840, when he was 14 years old, resigning himself to the study of law after his family decided that medical educations for both McClellan and his older brother John were too expensive. After two years at the university, he changed his goal to military service. With the assistance of his father&#x27;s letter to President John Tyler, McClellan was accepted at the United States Military Academy in 1842 at the age of 15, with the academy waiving its usual minimum age of 16.

At West Point, he was an energetic and ambitious cadet, deeply interested in the teachings of Dennis Hart Mahan and the theoretical strategic principles of Antoine-Henri Jomini. His closest friends were aristocratic southerners including George Pickett, Dabney Maury, Cadmus Wilcox, and A. P. Hill. These associations gave McClellan what he considered to be an appreciation of the southern mind and an understanding of the political and military implications of the sectional differences in the United States that led to the Civil War. He graduated at age 19 in 1846, second in his class of 59 cadets, losing the top position to Charles Seaforth Stewart only because of inferior drawing skills. He was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

==Career==
===Mexican–American War 1846–1848===
McClellan&#x27;s first assignment was with a company of engineers formed at West Point, but he quickly received orders to sail for the Mexican War. He arrived near the mouth of the Rio Grande in October 1846, well prepared for action with a double-barreled shotgun, two pistols, a saber, a dress sword, and a Bowie knife. He complained that he had arrived too late to take any part in the American victory at Monterrey in September. During a temporary armistice in which the forces of Gen. Zachary Taylor awaited action, McClellan was stricken with dysentery and malaria, which kept him in the hospital for nearly a month. Malaria would recur in later years; he called it his &quot;Mexican disease.&quot; He served as an engineering officer during the war, was frequently subject to enemy fire, and was appointed a brevet first lieutenant for his services at Contreras and Churubusco and to captain for his service at Chapultepec. He performed reconnaissance missions for Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott, a close friend of McClellan&#x27;s father.

McClellan&#x27;s experiences in the war would shape his military and political life. He learned that flanking movements (used by Scott at Cerro Gordo) were often better than frontal assaults, and the value of siege operations (Veracruz). He witnessed Scott&#x27;s success in balancing political with military affairs and his good relations with the civil population as he invaded, enforcing strict discipline on his soldiers to minimize damage to property. McClellan also developed a disdain for volunteer soldiers and officers, particularly politicians who cared nothing for discipline and training.

===Peacetime service===
McClellan returned to West Point to command his engineering company, which was attached to the academy for the purpose of training cadets in engineering activities. He chafed at the boredom of peacetime garrison service, although he greatly enjoyed the social life. In June 1851, he was ordered to Fort Delaware, a masonry work under construction on an island in the Delaware River, downriver from Philadelphia. In March 1852, he was ordered to report to Capt. Randolph B. Marcy at Fort Smith, Arkansas, to serve as second-in-command on an expedition to discover the sources of the Red River. By June the expedition reached the source of the north fork of the river and Marcy named a small tributary McClellan&#x27;s Creek. Upon their arrival on July 28, they were astonished to find that they had been given up for dead. A sensational story had reached the press that the expedition had been ambushed by 2,000 Comanches and killed to the last man. McClellan blamed the story on &quot;a set of scoundrels, who seek to keep up agitation on the frontier in order to get employment from the Govt. in one way or other.&quot;

In the fall of 1852, McClellan published a manual on bayonet tactics that he had translated from the original French. He also received an assignment to the Department of Texas, with orders to perform a survey of Texas rivers and harbors. In 1853, he participated in the Pacific Railroad surveys, ordered by Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, to select an appropriate route for the planned transcontinental railroad. McClellan surveyed the western portion of the northern corridor along the 47th and 49th parallels from St. Paul to the Puget Sound. In doing so, he demonstrated a tendency for insubordination toward senior political figures. Isaac Stevens, governor of the Washington Territory, became dissatisfied with McClellan&#x27;s performance in his scouting of passes across the Cascade Range.

McClellan selected Yakima Pass () without a thorough reconnaissance and refused the governor&#x27;s order to lead a party through it in winter conditions, relying on faulty intelligence about the depth of snowpack in that area. In so doing, he missed three greatly superior passes in the near vicinity, which were eventually used for railroads and interstate highways. The governor ordered McClellan to turn over his expedition logbooks, but McClellan steadfastly refused, most likely because of embarrassing personal comments that he had made throughout his adventures.

Returning to the East, McClellan began courting his future wife, Ellen Mary Marcy (1836–1915), the daughter of his former commander. Ellen, or Nelly, refused McClellan&#x27;s first proposal of marriage, one of nine that she received from a variety of suitors, including his West Point friend, A. P. Hill. Ellen accepted Hill&#x27;s proposal in 1856, but her family did not approve and he withdrew.

In June 1854, McClellan was sent on a secret reconnaissance mission to Santo Domingo at the behest of Jefferson Davis. McClellan assessed local defensive capabilities for the secretary. (The information was not used until 1870 when President Ulysses S. Grant unsuccessfully attempted to annex the Dominican Republic.) Davis was beginning to treat McClellan almost as a protégé, and his next assignment was to assess the logistical readiness of various railroads in the United States, once again with an eye toward planning for the transcontinental railroad. In March 1855, McClellan was promoted to captain and assigned to the 1st U.S. Cavalry regiment.

Due to his political connections and his mastery of French, McClellan received the assignment to be an official observer of the European armies in the Crimean War in 1855 as part of the Delafield Commission, led by Richard Delafield. Traveling widely, and interacting with the highest military commands and royal families, McClellan observed the siege of Sevastopol. Upon his return to the United States in 1856, he requested an assignment in Philadelphia to prepare his report, which contained a critical analysis of the siege and a lengthy description of the organization of the European armies. He also wrote a manual on cavalry tactics that was based on Russian cavalry regulations. Like other observers, though, McClellan did not appreciate the importance of the emergence of rifled muskets in the Crimean War, and the fundamental changes in warfare tactics it would require.

The Army adopted McClellan&#x27;s cavalry manual and also his design for a saddle, dubbed the McClellan Saddle, which he claimed to have seen used by Hussars in Prussia and Hungary. It became standard issue for as long as the U.S. horse cavalry existed and is still used for ceremonies.

===Civilian pursuits===

McClellan resigned his commission January 16, 1857, and, capitalizing on his experience with railroad assessment, became chief engineer and vice president of the Illinois Central Railroad, and then president of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad in 1860. He performed well in both jobs, expanding the Illinois Central toward New Orleans and helping the Ohio and Mississippi recover from the Panic of 1857. Despite his successes and lucrative salary ($10,000 per year), he was frustrated with civilian employment and continued to study classical military strategy assiduously. During the Utah War against the Mormons, he considered rejoining the Army. He also considered service as a filibuster in support of Benito Juárez in Mexico.

Before the outbreak of the Civil War, McClellan became active in politics, supporting the presidential campaign of Democrat Stephen A. Douglas in the 1860 election. He claimed to have defeated an attempt at vote fraud by Republicans by ordering the delay of a train that was carrying men to vote illegally in another county, enabling Douglas to win the county.

In October 1859, McClellan was able to resume his courtship of Ellen Mary; they were married in Calvary Church, New York City, on May 22, 1860.

==Civil War==
===Ohio===
At the start of the Civil War in 1861, McClellan&#x27;s knowledge of what was called &quot;big war science&quot; and his railroad experience suggested he might excel at military logistics. His old report from his tour in the Crimean war was quickly rushed for publication. This placed him in great demand as the Union mobilized its militia and its armies. The governors of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, the three largest states of the Union, actively pursued him to command their states&#x27; militia. McClellan expressed desire to command the state militia of his home state of Pennsylvania, but when the dispatch did not arrive to him as early as he expected it, he departed Illinois for Pennsylvania with the intent of commanding its state militia. On his way there, he stopped at Columbus to discuss the military situation in the Ohio valley with Ohio governor William Dennison. Dennison was impressed with McClellan and offered him command of the state militia on the spot, which he accepted. Pennsylvania&#x27;s governor had in fact already sent a wire to McClellan offering him command of the Pennsylvania state militia, but he did not receive this until the next day. McClellan was commissioned a major general of volunteers and took command of the Ohio militia on April 23, 1861. Unlike some of his fellow Union officers who came from abolitionist families, he was opposed to federal interference with slavery. For this reason, some of his Southern colleagues approached him informally about siding with the Confederacy, but he could not accept the concept of secession.

On May 3 McClellan re-entered federal service as commander of the Department of the Ohio, responsible for the defense of the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and, later, western Pennsylvania, western Virginia, and Missouri. On May 14, he was commissioned a major general in the regular army. At age 34, he outranked everyone in the Army except Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott, the general-in-chief. McClellan&#x27;s rapid promotion was partly due to his acquaintance with Salmon P. Chase, Treasury Secretary and former Ohio governor and senator.

As McClellan scrambled to process the thousands of men who were volunteering for service and to set up training camps, he also applied his mind to grand strategy. He wrote a letter to Gen. Scott on April 27, four days after assuming command in Ohio, that presented the first proposal for a strategy for the war. It contained two alternatives, each envisioning a prominent role for himself as commander. The first would use 80,000 men to invade Virginia through the Kanawha Valley toward Richmond. The second would use the same force to drive south instead, crossing the Ohio River into Kentucky and Tennessee. Scott rejected both plans as logistically unfeasible. Although he complimented McClellan and expressed his &quot;great confidence in your intelligence, zeal, science, and energy&quot;, he replied by letter that the 80,000 men would be better used on a river-based expedition to control the Mississippi River and split the Confederacy, accompanied by a strong Union blockade of Southern ports. This plan, which would require considerable patience of the Northern public, was derided in newspapers as the Anaconda Plan, but eventually proved to be the outline of the successful prosecution of the war. Relations between the two generals became increasingly strained over the summer and fall.

===Western Virginia===
Governor Dennison encouraged and pressured McClellan to conduct offensive operations in Northwestern Virginia, where unionist sentiment was strong and West Virginians were clamoring for secession from east Virginia. Dennison&#x27;s office was barraged by many letters from northwestern Virginians requesting military occupation of Northwestern Virginia to protect from potential reprisals from secessionists. McClellan&#x27;s first military operations were to occupy the area of western Virginia that wanted to remain in the Union and subsequently became the state of West Virginia. He had received intelligence reports on May 26 that the critical Baltimore and Ohio Railroad bridges in that portion of the state were being burned. He quickly implemented plans to invade the region. Confederate general George A. Porterfield was in charge of defending western Virginia with most of the rebel forces based at Grafton. McClellan triggered his first serious political controversy by proclaiming to the citizens there that his forces had no intentions of interfering with personal property—including slaves. &quot;Notwithstanding all that has been said by the traitors to induce you to believe that our advent among you will be signalized by interference with your slaves, understand one thing clearly—not only will we abstain from all such interference but we will on the contrary with an iron hand, crush any attempted insurrection on their part.&quot; He quickly realized that he had overstepped his bounds and apologized by letter to President Lincoln. The controversy was not that his proclamation was diametrically opposed to the administration&#x27;s policy at the time, but that he was so bold in stepping beyond his strictly military role.

As his forces moved rapidly into West Virginia across the Beverly-Fairmont turnpike towards Grafton, Confederate forces under the command of General Porterfield retreated quickly before McClellan&#x27;s superior forces towards Philippi, where Porterfield ordered his forces into a momentary rest before continuing the retreat. McClellan planned to encircle Porterfield&#x27;s command at Philippi through a complex plan that required coordination between three separate forces. This coordination failed, and the bombardment of the village commenced with a false signal. The Confederates at Philippi were completely routed, but they did not retreat towards a prepared line of Union troops as the plan originally envisioned. This was the first land conflict of the war. McClellan then split his forces up, one column went under the command of general Thomas A. Morris, marched to the Beverly-Fairmont turnpike to attack Confederate troops defending Laurel Mountain, who were under command of Confederate general Robert S. Garnett, and secure the northern road leading to the valley east of the mountains. This force beset the rebels at Laurel Mountain on July 7. His first personal command in battle was at Rich Mountain, where McClellan was plagued by hesitation and his erroneous idea that he was facing a sizeable Confederate force. McClellan wished to flank the strong Confederate position at Rich Mountain but found no avenue to do so, and ordered his forces into a preliminary siege. A young boy from the Hart family, whose house was on Rich Mountain, behind the Confederate position, a family with unionist sympathies, walked into McClellan&#x27;s camp and offered to show the Union troops a route through the woods around the Confederate left, this small trail would eventually turn north and link up with the Buckhannon-Beverly pike that cut through Rich Mountain eastwards to the valley, and then to Cheat River. McClellan was pleased and ordered his subordinate, Colonel William S. Rosecrans, to lead a contingent of troops, flank the Confederates and take them by surprise. Due to intense rain, a movement that was originally estimated to take an hour or two at most, took more than seven hours. 

After a long time without receiving news from Rosecrans, McClellan grew nervous and dispatched an order to call off this attack, but the orders never reached Rosecrans. Finally, after an exhausting march, Rosecrans took up positions south of the Hart home and launched a vigorous attack up the hill to the Hart farm. Confederate troops, who were under the overall command of general John Pegram, attempted a defense and moved two guns to the road to repulse this attack, which was well east of the main Confederate position on Rich Mountain. Another regiment was ordered out of Beverly to link up with the Confederate position at Rich Mountain, this regiment had arrived too late and found the Union troops had overrun the road, captured a Confederate cannon and were holding the road between Beverly and the Confederate troops west of their position on Rich Mountain (behind the rebel defensive line). McClellan heard the sounds of battle from his headquarters but being unsure and nervous, ordered no attack on the mountain. The next day the demoralized Confederate troops retreated from Rich Mountain through trails that took them northwards and then attempted to move eastwards back to Beverly on the Tygart valley. A harrowing pursuit caused several hundred, including Pegram, to surrender next day, and the battle of Rich Mountain ended in a decisive Union victory. Confederate troops 15 km north-west, defending Laurel Mountain on the Beverely-Fairmont turnpike, retreated in great disorder after hearing of the rebel defeat on Rich Mountain. McClellan in his later report severely criticized Morris for his purported late pursuit of the Confederates after their retreat from there, even though he had extensively instructed Morris earlier to be very cautious and wary in his advance against enemy forces. Rosecrans bitterly complained that his attack on Rich Mountain was not reinforced as McClellan had agreed. 

McClellan was obliged to absorb all credit for the victory at Rich Mountain, and lent no credit to Rosecrans&#x27; performance during the battle. These victories propelled McClellan to the status of national hero. The &quot;New York Herald&quot; entitled an article about him &quot;Gen. McClellan, the Napoleon of the Present War&quot;. After the defeat of Confederate forces at Rich Mountain and Laurel Mountain, Union troops sharply pursued them eastwards across the Tygart Valley all the way to Cheat River &amp; Cheat Mountain. Confederate general Garnett was killed in a rearguard action on Cheat River at Corrick&#x27;s ford by Morris&#x27; force, and thus Confederate presence had been completely ejected from West Virginia, although Confederate troops were still present in Kanawha under the command of Henry A. Wise and John Floyd. McClellan proceeded to bombastically proclaim that secessionist presence in West Virginia has been completely crushed. McClellan organized a defensive network of the region spanning Cheat Mountain, Allegheny Mountain all the way to Gauley Bridge in Kanawha. McClellan chose Rosecrans as his successor and briefed him on the situation before departing for Washington upon being summoned to reorganize the routed Union Army of Northeastern Virginia after the defeat at Bull Run.

=== Building an army ===
After the defeat of the Union forces at Bull Run on July 21, 1861, Lincoln summoned McClellan from western Virginia, where McClellan had given the North the only engagements bearing a semblance of victory. He traveled by special train on the main Pennsylvania line from Wheeling through Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, and on to Washington City, and was greeted by enthusiastic crowds that met his train along the way.
Carl Sandburg wrote, &quot;McClellan was the man of the hour, pointed to by events, and chosen by an overwhelming weight of public and private opinion.&quot; On July 26, the day he reached the capital, McClellan was appointed commander of the Military Division of the Potomac, the main Union force responsible for the defense of Washington. On August 20, several military units in Virginia were consolidated into his department and he immediately formed the Army of the Potomac, with himself as its first commander. This Army became the primary force in the Union army in the Eastern Theatre that protected the Capital and the North. He reveled in his newly acquired power and influence:


During the summer and fall, McClellan brought a high degree of organization to his new army, and greatly improved its morale with frequent trips to review and encourage his units. It was a remarkable achievement, in which he came to personify the Army of the Potomac and reaped the adulation of his men. He created defenses for Washington that were almost impregnable, consisting of 48 forts and strong points, with 480 guns manned by 7,200 artillerists. The Army of the Potomac grew in number from 50,000 in July to 168,000 in November, becoming the largest military force the United States had raised until that time. But this was also a time of tension in the high command, as he continued to quarrel frequently with the government and the general-in-chief, Lt. Gen. Scott, on matters of strategy. McClellan rejected the tenets of Scott&#x27;s Anaconda Plan, favoring instead an overwhelming grand battle, in the Napoleonic style. He proposed that his army should be expanded to 273,000 men and 600 guns and &quot;crush the rebels in one campaign&quot;. He favored a war that would impose little impact on civilian populations and require no emancipation of slaves.

McClellan&#x27;s antipathy to emancipation added to the pressure on him, as he received bitter criticism from Radical Republicans in the government. He viewed slavery as an institution recognized in the Constitution, and entitled to federal protection wherever it existed (Lincoln held the same public position until August 1862). McClellan&#x27;s writings after the war were typical of many Northerners: &quot;I confess to a prejudice in favor of my own race, &amp; can&#x27;t learn to like the odor of either Billy goats or niggers.&quot; But in November 1861, he wrote to his wife, &quot;I will, if successful, throw my sword onto the scale to force an improvement in the condition of those poor blacks.&quot; He later wrote that had it been his place to arrange the terms of peace, he would have insisted on gradual emancipation, guarding the rights of both slaves and masters, as part of any settlement. But he made no secret of his opposition to the Radical Republicans. He told Ellen, &quot;I will not fight for the abolitionists.&quot; This put him in opposition with officials of the administration who believed he was attempting to implement the policies of the opposition party.

The immediate problem with McClellan&#x27;s war strategy was that he was convinced the Confederates were ready to attack him with overwhelming numbers. On August 8, believing that the Confederacy had over 100,000 troops facing him (in contrast to the 35,000 they had actually deployed at Bull Run a few weeks earlier), he declared a state of emergency in the capital. By August 19, he estimated 150,000 rebel soldiers on his front. In this, McClellan was perhaps influenced by his questioning of Confederate deserter Edward B. McMurdy, whose testimony was not accepted by Lincoln, Secretary of State Seward, or General-in-Chief Scott, but reaffirmed for McClellan the numbers he had convinced himself of. McClellan&#x27;s feeling of facing overwhelming odds in subsequent campaigns throughout his tenure as General of the Army of the Potomac were strongly influenced by the overblown enemy strength estimates of his secret service chief, detective Allan Pinkerton, but in August 1861, these estimates were entirely McClellan&#x27;s own. The result was a level of extreme caution that sapped the initiative of McClellan&#x27;s army and dismayed the government. Historian and biographer Stephen W. Sears observed that McClellan&#x27;s actions would have been &quot;essentially sound&quot; for a commander who was as outnumbered as McClellan thought he was, but McClellan in fact rarely had less than a two-to-one advantage over the armies that opposed him in 1861 and 1862. That fall, for example, Confederate forces ranged from 35,000 to 60,000, whereas the Army of the Potomac in September numbered 122,000 men; in early December 170,000; by year end, 192,000.

The dispute with Scott became increasingly personal. Scott (as well as many in the War Department) was outraged that McClellan refused to divulge any details about his strategic planning, or even such basic information as the strengths and dispositions of his units. McClellan claimed he could not trust anyone in the administration to keep his plans secret from the press, and thus the enemy. In the course of a disagreement about defensive forces on the Potomac River, McClellan wrote to his wife on August 10: &quot;Genl Scott is the great obstacle—he will not comprehend the danger &amp; is either a traitor, or an incompetent. I have to fight my way against him.&quot; Scott became so disillusioned with the young general that he offered his resignation to President Lincoln, who initially refused to accept it. Rumors traveled through the capital that McClellan might resign, or instigate a military coup, if Scott were not removed. Lincoln&#x27;s Cabinet met on October 18 and agreed to accept Scott&#x27;s resignation for “reasons of health”.

However, the subsequently formed Army of the Potomac had high morale and was extremely proud of their general, some even referring to McClellan as the savior of Washington. He prevented the army&#x27;s morale from collapsing at least twice, in the aftermath of the First and Second Battles of Bull Run. Many historians argue that he was talented in this aspect.

On November 1, 1861, Winfield Scott retired and McClellan became general-in-chief of all the Union armies. The president expressed his concern about the &quot;vast labor&quot; involved in the dual role of army commander and general-in-chief, but McClellan responded, &quot;I can do it all.&quot;

Lincoln, as well as many other leaders and citizens of the northern states, became increasingly impatient with McClellan&#x27;s slowness to attack the Confederate forces still massed near Washington. The Union defeat at the minor Battle of Ball&#x27;s Bluff near Leesburg in October added to the frustration and indirectly damaged McClellan. In December, the Congress formed a Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, which became a thorn in the side of many generals throughout the war, accusing them of incompetence and, in some cases, treason. McClellan was called as the first witness on December 23, but he contracted typhoid fever and could not attend. Instead, his subordinate officers testified, and their candid admissions that they had no knowledge of specific strategies for advancing against the Confederates raised many calls for McClellan&#x27;s dismissal.

McClellan further damaged his reputation by his insulting insubordination to his commander-in-chief. He privately referred to Lincoln, whom he had known before the war as a lawyer for the Illinois Central, as &quot;nothing more than a well-meaning baboon&quot;, a &quot;gorilla&quot;, and &quot;ever unworthy of ... his high position&quot;. On November 13, he snubbed the president, who had come to visit McClellan&#x27;s house, by making him wait for 30 minutes, only to be told that the general had gone to bed and could not receive him.

On January 10, 1862, Lincoln met with top generals (McClellan did not attend) and directed them to formulate a plan of attack, expressing his exasperation with General McClellan with the following remark: &quot;If General McClellan does not want to use the army, I would like to borrow it for a time.&quot; On January 12, 1862, McClellan was summoned to the White House, where the Cabinet demanded to hear his war plans. For the first time, he revealed his intentions to transport the Army of the Potomac by ship to Urbanna, Virginia, on the Rappahannock River, outflanking the Confederate forces near Washington, and proceeding overland to capture Richmond. He refused to give any specific details of the proposed campaign, even to his friend, newly appointed War Secretary Edwin M. Stanton. On January 27, Lincoln issued an order that required all of his armies to begin offensive operations by February 22, Washington&#x27;s birthday. On January 31, he issued a supplementary order for the Army of the Potomac to move overland to attack the Confederates at Manassas Junction and Centreville. McClellan immediately replied with a 22-page letter objecting in detail to the president&#x27;s plan and advocating instead his Urbanna plan, which was the first written instance of the plan&#x27;s details being presented to the president. Although Lincoln believed his plan was superior, he was relieved that McClellan finally agreed to begin moving, and reluctantly approved. On March 8, doubting McClellan&#x27;s resolve, Lincoln again interfered with the army commander&#x27;s prerogatives. He called a council of war at the White House in which McClellan&#x27;s subordinates were asked about their confidence in the Urbanna plan. They expressed their confidence to varying degrees. After the meeting, Lincoln issued another order, naming specific officers as corps commanders to report to McClellan (who had been reluctant to do so prior to assessing his division commanders&#x27; effectiveness in combat, even though this would have meant his direct supervision of twelve divisions in the field).

Two more crises would confront McClellan before he could implement his plans. The Confederate forces under General Joseph E. Johnston withdrew from their positions before Washington, assuming new positions south of the Rappahannock, which completely nullified the Urbanna strategy. McClellan revised his plans to have his troops disembark at Fort Monroe, Virginia, and advance up the Virginia Peninsula to Richmond, an operation that would be known as the Peninsula Campaign. Then, however, McClellan came under extreme criticism in the press and Congress when it was learned that Johnston&#x27;s forces had not only slipped away unnoticed, but had for months fooled the Union Army with logs painted black to appear as cannons, nicknamed Quaker Guns. Congress&#x27;s joint committee visited the abandoned Confederate lines and radical Republicans introduced a resolution demanding the dismissal of McClellan, but it was narrowly defeated by a parliamentary maneuver. The second crisis was the emergence of the Confederate ironclad CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, which threw Washington into a panic and made naval support operations on the James River seem problematic.

On March 11, 1862, Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief, leaving him in command of only the Army of the Potomac, ostensibly so that McClellan would be free to devote all his attention to the move on Richmond. Lincoln&#x27;s order was ambiguous as to whether McClellan might be restored following a successful campaign. In fact, the general-in-chief position was left unfilled. Lincoln, Stanton, and a group of officers who formed the &quot;War Board&quot; directed the strategic actions of the Union armies that spring. Although McClellan was assuaged by supportive comments Lincoln made to him, in time he saw the change of command very differently, describing it as a part of an intrigue &quot;to secure the failure of the approaching campaign&quot;.

===Peninsula campaign===
McClellan&#x27;s army began to sail from Alexandria on March 17. It was an armada that dwarfed all previous American expeditions, transporting 121,500 men, 44 artillery batteries, 1,150 wagons, over 15,000 horses, and tons of equipment and supplies. An English observer remarked that it was the &quot;stride of a giant&quot;. The army&#x27;s advance from Fort Monroe up the Virginia Peninsula proved to be slow. McClellan&#x27;s plan for a rapid seizure of Yorktown was foiled by the removal of 1st Corps from the Army of the Potomac for the defense of Washington. McClellan had hoped to use the 1st Corps to capture Glouchester Point and thus outflank the Confederate position. When he discovered that the Confederates had fortified a line across the Peninsula he hesitated to attack and instead &quot;played it safe&quot;. As Swinton notes: It is possible, however—and there is a considerable volume of evidence bearing upon this point—that General McClellan, during all the earlier portion of the month before Yorktown, had it in his mind, even without McDowell&#x27;s corps, to undertake the decisive turning movement by the north side of the York. In this event, it would not only be in the direction of his plan to make no attack, but it would play into his hands that his opponent should accumulate his forces on the Peninsula. Yet this halting between two opinions had the result that, when he had abandoned the purpose of making the turning movement, it had become too late for him to make a direct attack. McClellan asked for the opinion of his chief engineer John G. Barnard, who recommended against an assault. This caused him to decide on a siege of the city, which required considerable preparation.

McClellan continued to believe intelligence reports that credited the Confederates with two or three times the men they actually had. Early in the campaign, Confederate General John B. &quot;Prince John&quot; Magruder defended the Peninsula against McClellan&#x27;s advance with a vastly smaller force. He created a false impression of many troops behind the lines and of even more troops arriving. He accomplished this by marching small groups of men repeatedly past places where they could be observed at a distance or were just out of sight, accompanied by great noise and fanfare. During this time, General Johnston was able to provide Magruder with reinforcements, but even then there were far fewer troops than McClellan believed were opposite him.

After a month of preparation, just before he was to assault the Confederate works at Yorktown, McClellan learned that Johnston had withdrawn up the Peninsula towards Williamsburg. McClellan was thus required to give chase without any benefit of the heavy artillery so carefully amassed in front of Yorktown. The Battle of Williamsburg on May 5 is considered a Union victory—McClellan&#x27;s first—but the Confederate army was not destroyed and most of their troops were successfully moved past Williamsburg to Richmond&#x27;s outer defenses while the battle was waged and for several days thereafter.

McClellan had also placed hopes on a simultaneous naval approach to Richmond via the James River. That approach failed following the Union Navy&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Drewry&#x27;s Bluff, about downstream from the Confederate capital, on May 15. Basing artillery on a strategic bluff high above a bend in the river, and sinking boats to create an impassable series of obstacles in the river itself, the Confederates effectively blocked this potential approach to Richmond.

McClellan&#x27;s army moved towards Richmond over the next three weeks, coming to within of it. He established a supply base on the Pamunkey River (a navigable tributary of the York River) at White House Landing where the Richmond and York River Railroad extending to Richmond crossed, and commandeered the railroad, transporting steam locomotives and rolling stock to the site by barge.

On May 31, as McClellan planned an assault, his army was surprised by a Confederate attack. Johnston saw that the Union army was split in half by the rain-swollen Chickahominy River and hoped to defeat it in detail at Seven Pines and Fair Oaks. McClellan was unable to command the army personally because of a recurrence of malarial fever, but his subordinates were able to repel the attacks. Nevertheless, McClellan received criticism from Washington for not counterattacking, which some believed could have opened the city of Richmond to capture. Johnston was wounded in the battle, and General Robert E. Lee assumed command of the Army of Northern Virginia. McClellan spent the next three weeks repositioning his troops and waiting for promised reinforcements. As Lee recounted, McClellan was attempting to make &quot;this a battle of posts&quot; which would lock the Confederate army in an attritional battle with superior Union firepower.

At the end of June, Lee began a series of attacks that became known as the Seven Days Battles. The first major battle, at Mechanicsville, was poorly coordinated by Lee and his subordinates and resulted in heavy casualties for little tactical gain. However, the battle had a significant impact on McClellan&#x27;s nerve. The surprise appearance of Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s troops in the battle (when they had last been reported to be many miles away in the Shenandoah Valley) convinced McClellan that he was even more outnumbered than he had thought. He reported to Washington that he faced 200,000 Confederates, perhaps due to a false report on the arrival of another Confederate army P.G.T. Beauregard. The number of men McClellan was actually faced varies, with Joseph Harsh in &quot;Confederate Tide Rising&quot; placing Lee&#x27;s army at 112,220 men compared with the 105,857 under McClellan.
Lee continued his offensive at Gaines&#x27;s Mill to the east. That night, McClellan decided to withdraw his army to a safer base, well below Richmond, on a portion of the James River that was under control of the Union Navy. In doing so, Lee had assumed that the Union army would withdraw to the east toward its existing supply base and McClellan&#x27;s move to the south delayed Lee&#x27;s response for at least 24 hours. Ethan Rafuse notes &quot;McClellan&#x27;s change of base to the James, however, thwarted Lee&#x27;s attempt to do this. Not only did McClellan&#x27;s decision allow the Federals to gain control of the time and place for the battles that took place in late June and early July, it enabled them to fight in a way that inflicted terrible beating on the Confederate army...More importantly, by the end of the Seven Days Battles, McClellan had dramatically improved his operational situation.&quot;

But McClellan was also tacitly acknowledging that he would no longer be able to invest Richmond, the object of his campaign; the heavy siege artillery required would be almost impossible to transport without the railroad connections available from his original supply base on the York River. In a telegram to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, reporting on these events, McClellan blamed the Lincoln administration for his reversals. &quot;If I save this army now, I tell you plainly I owe no thanks to you or to any other persons in Washington. You have done your best to sacrifice this army.&quot; Fortunately for McClellan, Lincoln never saw that inflammatory statement (at least at that time) because it was censored by the War Department telegrapher.
McClellan was also fortunate that the failure of the campaign left his army mostly intact, because he was generally absent from the fighting and neglected to name any second-in-command who might direct his retreat. Military historian Stephen W. Sears wrote, &quot;When he deserted his army on the Glendale and Malvern Hill battlefields during the Seven Days, he was guilty of dereliction of duty. Had the Army of the Potomac been wrecked on either of these fields (at Glendale the possibility had been real), that charge under the Articles of War would likely have been brought against him.&quot; In the battle of Glendale, McClellan was away behind Malvern Hill, without telegraph communications and too distant to command his army. In the battle of Malvern Hill, he was on a gunboat, the , which at one point was away, down the James River. In both battles, effective command of the army fell to his friend and V Corps commander Brigadier General Fitz John Porter. When the public heard about the &quot;Galena&quot;, it was yet another great embarrassment, comparable to the Quaker Guns at Manassas. Editorial cartoons published in the course of the 1864 presidential campaign lampooned McClellan for having preferred the safety of a ship while a battle was fought in the distance.

McClellan was reunited with his army at Harrison&#x27;s Landing on the James. Debates were held as to whether the army should be evacuated or attempt to resume an offensive toward Richmond. McClellan maintained his estrangement from Abraham Lincoln with his repeated call for reinforcements and by writing a lengthy letter in which he proposed strategic and political guidance for the war, continuing his opposition to abolition or seizure of slaves as a tactic. He concluded by implying he should be restored as general-in-chief, but Lincoln responded by naming Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck to the post without consulting, or even informing, McClellan. Lincoln and Stanton also offered command of the Army of the Potomac to Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside, who refused the appointment.

Back in Washington, a reorganization of units created the Army of Virginia under Maj. Gen. John Pope, who was directed to advance toward Richmond from the northeast. McClellan, not wishing to abandon his campaign, delayed the return of the Army of the Potomac from the Peninsula enough so that the reinforcements arrived while the northern Virginia campaign was already underway. The Fifth Corps under Porter from the Army of the Potomac would serve with Pope during the campaign. A frustrated McClellan wrote to his wife before the battle, &quot;Pope will be thrashed ... &amp; be disposed of [by Lee]. ... Such a villain as he is ought to bring defeat upon any cause that employs him.&quot; Lee had gambled on removing significant units from the Peninsula to attack Pope, who was beaten decisively at Second Bull Run in August.

===Maryland campaign===
After the defeat of Pope at Second Bull Run, President Lincoln reluctantly returned to McClellan. On September 2, 1862, Lincoln named McClellan to command &quot;the fortifications of Washington, and all the troops for the defense of the capital&quot;. The appointment was controversial in the Cabinet, a majority of whom signed a petition declaring to the president &quot;our deliberate opinion that, at this time, it is not safe to entrust to Major General McClellan the command of any Army of the United States&quot;. The president admitted that it was like &quot;curing the bite with the hair of the dog&quot;. But Lincoln told his secretary, John Hay, &quot;We must use what tools we have. There is no man in the Army who can man these fortifications and lick these troops of ours into shape half as well as he. If he can&#x27;t fight himself, he excels in making others ready to fight.&quot;

Northern fears of a continued offensive by Robert E. Lee were realized when he launched his Maryland campaign on September 4, hoping to arouse pro-Southern sympathy in the slave state of Maryland. McClellan&#x27;s pursuit began on September 5. He marched toward Maryland with six of his reorganized corps. Numbers vary as to the size of McClellan&#x27;s force with its paper strength at 87,164. Steven R. Stotelmyer in &quot;Too Useful to Sacrifice&quot; places it at about 60,000 men, noting that the 87,000 number includes non-combat soldiers and units not immediately available. McClellan left two corps behind to defend Washington. McClellan&#x27;s reception in Frederick, Maryland, as he marched towards Lee&#x27;s army, was described by the correspondent for Harper&#x27;s Magazine:

Lee divided his forces into multiple columns, spread apart widely as he moved into Maryland and also maneuvered to capture the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry. This was a risky move for a smaller army, but Lee was counting on his knowledge of McClellan&#x27;s temperament. He told one of his generals, &quot;He is an able general but a very cautious one. His army is in a very demoralized and chaotic condition, and will not be prepared for offensive operations—or he will not think it so—for three or four weeks. Before that time I hope to be on the Susquehanna.&quot; Lee&#x27;s assessment proved to be inaccurate as McClellan reacted quickly, with the Confederate leader remarking that McClellan was &quot;advancing more rapidly than was convenient.&quot; Many classic histories have portrayed McClellan&#x27;s army as moving lethargically, averaging only a day.

Meanwhile, Union soldiers accidentally found a copy of Lee&#x27;s orders dividing his army, wrapped around a package of cigars in an abandoned camp. Special Order 191 revealed the widely dispersed configuration of Lee&#x27;s Army, making it vulnerable to destruction in detail. The document was verified at McClellan&#x27;s headquarters in Frederick on September 13. Upon realizing the intelligence value of this discovery, McClellan threw up his arms and exclaimed, &quot;Now I know what to do!&quot; He waved the order at his old Army friend, Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, and said, &quot;Here is a paper with which if I cannot whip Bobbie Lee, I will be willing to go home.&quot; He telegraphed President Lincoln: &quot;I have the whole rebel force in front of me, but I am confident, and no time shall be lost. I think Lee has made a gross mistake, and that he will be severely punished for it. I have all the plans of the rebels, and will catch them in their own trap if my men are equal to the emergency. ... Will send you trophies.&quot;

====Battle of South Mountain====
At the discovery of the Lost Order, McClellan&#x27;s Assistant Adjutant General verified the signature and handwriting of the officer who wrote out the order, as he knew him well, so there was no doubt as to its authenticity. Within hours of receiving the order, McClellan dispatched some of his cavalry to assess whether the Confederates had moved in accordance with the order.

Still, historians—including James M. McPherson in &quot;Crossroads of Freedom: Antietam&quot; and &quot;The Battle Cry of Freedom&quot;, Stephen Sears in &quot;Landscape Turned Red&quot;, John Keegan in &quot;The American Civil War&quot;, and James V. Murfin in &quot;The Gleam of Bayonets&quot;—have provided clear evidence that McClellan, despite his expressed joy upon being given the order, delayed by some 18 hours before reacting to the intelligence coup, resulting in Lee&#x27;s being able to elude the late-arriving Union forces, and this remains the standard view. However, Gene Thorp in a 2012 article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; cited evidence that the vanguard of Army of the Potomac was in motion all day on the 13th due to orders McClellan had issued the previous day. After the war, McClellan held to the claim that he acted immediately to put his armies on the move.

McClellan ordered his units to set out for the South Mountain passes and was able to punch through the defended passes that separated them from Lee. The stubborn Confederate defenses gave Lee enough time to concentrate many of his men at Sharpsburg, Maryland. As noted by historians such as Stotelmyer, the significance of the Union victory at South Mountain should not be underestimated. It ruined Lee&#x27;s plans to invade Pennsylvania and took the initiative away from the Confederate commander. The Battle of South Mountain also presented McClellan with an opportunity for one of the great theatrical moments of his career, as historian Sears describes:

The Union army reached Antietam Creek, to the east of Sharpsburg, on the evening of September 15. A planned attack on September 16 was put off because of early morning fog, allowing Lee to prepare his defenses with an army less than half the size of McClellan&#x27;s.

====Battle of Antietam====
The Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, was the single bloodiest day in American military history. The outnumbered Confederate forces fought desperately and well. Despite significant advantages in manpower, McClellan was unable to concentrate his forces effectively, which meant that Lee was able to shift his defenders to parry each of three Union thrusts, launched separately and sequentially against the Confederate left, center, and finally the right. McClellan was also unwilling, due to Porter&#x27;s opinion, to employ his ample reserve forces to capitalize on localized successes. Historian James M. McPherson has pointed out that the two corps McClellan kept in reserve were in fact larger than Lee&#x27;s entire force. The reason for McClellan&#x27;s reluctance was that, as in previous battles, he was convinced he was outnumbered.
The battle was tactically inconclusive, with the Union suffering a higher overall number of casualties, although Lee technically was defeated because he withdrew first from the battlefield and retreated back to Virginia, and lost a larger percentage of his army than McClellan did. McClellan wired to Washington, &quot;Our victory was complete. The enemy is driven back into Virginia.&quot; Yet there was obvious disappointment that McClellan had not crushed Lee, who was fighting with a smaller army with its back to the Potomac River. Although McClellan&#x27;s subordinates can claim their share of responsibility for delays (such as Ambrose Burnside&#x27;s misadventures at Burnside Bridge) and blunders (Edwin V. Sumner&#x27;s attack without reconnaissance), these were localized problems from which the full army could have recovered. As with the decisive battles in the Seven Days, McClellan&#x27;s headquarters were too far to the rear to allow his personal control over the battle. He made no use of his cavalry forces for reconnaissance. He did not share his overall battle plans with his corps commanders, which prevented them from using initiative outside of their sectors. And he was far too willing to accept cautious advice about saving his reserves, such as when a significant breakthrough in the center of the Confederate line could have been exploited, but Fitz John Porter is said to have told McClellan, &quot;Remember, General, I command the last reserve of the last Army of the Republic.&quot;

Despite being a tactical draw, Antietam is considered a turning point of the war and a victory for the Union because it ended Lee&#x27;s strategic campaign (his first invasion of the North) and it allowed President Lincoln to issue the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on September 22 and the Final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. Although Lincoln had intended to issue the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation earlier, Secretary of State William H. Seward advised him to wait until a Union victory to avoid the perception that it was issued out of desperation, and Lincoln accepted the advice. The Union victory and Lincoln&#x27;s proclamation played a considerable role in dissuading the governments of France and Britain from recognizing the Confederacy; some suspected they were planning to do so in the aftermath of another Union defeat. McClellan had no prior knowledge that the plans for emancipation rested on his battle performance.

Because McClellan failed to pursue Lee aggressively after Antietam, Lincoln ordered that he be removed from command on November 5, 1862. Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside assumed command of the Army of the Potomac on November 9, 1862. McClellan wrote to his wife, Those in whose judgment I rely tell me that I fought the battle splendidly and that it was a masterpiece of art... I feel I have done all that can be asked in twice saving the country. ... I feel some little pride in having, with a beaten &amp; demoralized army, defeated Lee so utterly... Well, one of these days history will I trust do me justice.

==1864 presidential election==

Secretary Stanton ordered McClellan to report to Trenton, New Jersey, for further orders, although none was issued. As the war progressed, there were various calls to return McClellan to an important command, following the Union defeats at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, as Robert E. Lee moved north at the start of the Gettysburg campaign, and as Jubal Early threatened Washington in 1864. When Ulysses S. Grant became general-in-chief, he discussed returning McClellan to an unspecified position. But all of these opportunities were impossible, given the opposition within the administration and the knowledge that McClellan posed a potential political threat. McClellan worked for months on a lengthy report describing his two major campaigns and his successes in organizing the Army, replying to his critics and justifying his actions by accusing the administration of undercutting him and denying him necessary reinforcements. The War Department was reluctant to publish his report because, just after completing it in October 1863, McClellan openly declared his entrance to the political stage as a Democrat.
McClellan was nominated by the Democrats to run against Abraham Lincoln in the 1864 U.S. presidential election. Following the example of Winfield Scott, he ran as a U.S. Army general still on active duty; he did not resign his commission until election day, November 8, 1864. McClellan supported continuation of the war and restoration of the Union, but not the abolition of slavery, although the party platform, written by Copperhead leader Clement Vallandigham of Ohio, was opposed to that position. The platform called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a negotiated settlement with the Confederacy. McClellan was forced to repudiate the platform, which made his campaign inconsistent and difficult. He also was not helped by the party&#x27;s choice for vice president, George H. Pendleton, a peace candidate from Ohio.

The deep division in the party, the unity of the Republicans (running under the label &quot;National Union Party&quot;), the absence of a large portion of the Democrats&#x27; base (the South) from the voter pool, and the military successes by Union forces in the fall of 1864, doomed McClellan&#x27;s candidacy. Lincoln won the election handily, with 212 Electoral College votes to 21, and a popular vote of 2,218,388 to 1,812,807 or 55% to 45%. For all his popularity with the troops, McClellan failed to secure their support and the military vote went to Lincoln nearly 3–1. Lincoln&#x27;s share of the vote in the Army of the Potomac was 70%.

==Postwar years==
At the conclusion of the war (1865) McClellan and his family went to Europe, not returning until 1868; in this period he did not participate in politics. Prior to his return in September 1868, the Democratic Party had expressed some interest in nominating him for president again, but Ulysses S. Grant became the Republican candidate in May 1868, and this interest died.
McClellan worked on engineering projects in New York City and was offered the position of president of the newly formed University of California, which he declined.

McClellan was appointed chief engineer of the New York City Department of Docks in 1870. Beginning in 1872, he also served as the president of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad. He and his family then embarked on another three-year stay in Europe (1873–75).

In March 1877, the Governor of New York, Lucius Robinson, nominated McClellan to serve as the first state Superintendent of Public Works, but the New York State Senate rejected him as &quot;incompetent to fill the position for which he was named&quot;.

==Governor of New Jersey==
===1877 campaign===

McClellan was a resident of West Orange, New Jersey in 1877 when the New Jersey Democratic Party nominated him for governor, an action that took him by surprise because he had not expressed an interest in the position. His nomination was largely an effort by key party members to prevent the leading candidate, Leon Abbett, from gaining the nomination. After his name was unexpectedly placed into nomination at the state convention, there was a stampede and he was nominated by acclamation.

In the general election, he faced William A. Newell, a Republican former governor who accused McClellan of living in New York, which he easily refuted. McClellan won the election as Democrats gained a majority in both houses of the New Jersey legislature for the first time since 1870.

===Term in office===
Most likely due to his personal popularity and celebrity, McClellan&#x27;s inauguration was held outdoors to accommodate the large crowd. In his inaugural address, he said the most urgent matter before the state was relief from the Panic of 1873. To that end, he advocated for cautious spending to allow for a state tax cut of fifty percent; by the end of McClellan&#x27;s term, the state tax on residents was abolished entirely.

Soon after taking office, McClellan fell out of favor with the State Senate over appointments and patronage. The legislature also enacted several highly partisan measures designed to ensure Democratic control, including an aggressive gerrymander of the New Jersey Assembly districts and another disenfranchising college students (who tended to vote Republican). Backlash to these measures led to the election of Republican majorities in both houses for the remainder of McClellan&#x27;s term in office, limiting the scope of his agenda. McClellan&#x27;s administration was marked by caution and conservatism. Few concrete measures passed and those that did, such as the abolition of the state tax and improvements to the National Guard, were widely popular.

In addition to tax reduction, McClellan&#x27;s economic agenda included the institution of a Bureau of Statistics of Labor and Industries and the creation of an agricultural experiment station to modernize growing and farming practices. Both passed the legislature in 1878 and 1880, respectively. His administration stressed the necessity of education in the conversion of unskilled labor to skilled labor and in industrial development generally by expanding the state library and calling for trades training for young men in public schools, as suited for the local economy.

McClellan also applied his military experience to improve the discipline, organization, and armament of the New Jersey National Guard. During his administration, two companies were equipped with Gatling guns, a new battalion was organized, regular rifle practice was instituted, and provisions were made to supply new uniforms.

==Retirement and death==
The concluding chapter of his political career was his strong support in 1884 for Grover Cleveland. He was interested in the position of Secretary of War in Cleveland&#x27;s cabinet, but Senator John R. McPherson, who had opposed McClellan for governor in 1877, succeeded in blocking his nomination.

McClellan devoted his final years to traveling and writing; he produced his memoirs, &quot;McClellan&#x27;s Own Story&quot; (published posthumously in 1887), in which he stridently defended his conduct during the war. He died unexpectedly of a heart attack at age 58 at Orange, New Jersey, after suffering from chest pains for a few weeks. His final words, at 3 a.m., October 29, 1885, were, &quot;I feel easy now. Thank you.&quot; He was buried at Riverview Cemetery in Trenton.

==Family==
McClellan&#x27;s son, George B. McClellan Jr. (1865–1940), was born in Dresden in the Kingdom of Saxony during the family&#x27;s first trip to Europe. Known within the family as Max, he too became a politician, serving as a United States Representative (1893–1903) and as Mayor of New York City from 1904 to 1909. McClellan&#x27;s daughter, Mary (&quot;May&quot;) (1861–1945), married a French diplomat and spent much of her life abroad. Both remained childless. 

McClellan&#x27;s wife, Ellen, died in Nice, France, in 1915 while visiting Mary at her home &quot;Villa Antietam&quot;.

==Legacy==
The New York &quot;Evening Post&quot; commented in McClellan&#x27;s obituary, &quot;Probably no soldier who did so little fighting has ever had his qualities as a commander so minutely, and we may add, so fiercely discussed.&quot; This fierce discussion has continued for over a century. McClellan is usually ranked in the lowest tier of Civil War commanders. However, the debate over McClellan&#x27;s ability and talents remains the subject of much controversy among Civil War and military historians. He has been universally praised for his organizational abilities and for his very good relations with his troops. They referred to him affectionately as &quot;Little Mac&quot;. Other nicknames McClellan received included &quot;Young Napoleon&quot; and &quot;the little Napoleon&quot;. McClellan himself summed up his style of warfare in a draft of his memoirs:

Stephen Sears notes that 

One of the reasons that McClellan&#x27;s reputation has suffered is his own memoirs. Historian Allan Nevins wrote, &quot;Students of history must always be grateful McClellan so frankly exposed his own weaknesses in this posthumous book.&quot; Doris Kearns Goodwin writes that a review of his personal correspondence during the war reveals a tendency for self-aggrandizement and unwarranted self-congratulation. His original draft was completed in 1881, but the only copy was destroyed by fire. He began to write another draft of what would be published posthumously, in 1887, as &quot;McClellan&#x27;s Own Story&quot;. However, he died before it was half completed and his literary executor, William C. Prime, editor of the pro-McClellan &quot;New York Journal of Commerce&quot;, included excerpts from some 250 of McClellan&#x27;s wartime letters to his wife, in which it had been his habit to reveal his innermost feelings and opinions in unbridled fashion.

Robert E. Lee, on being asked who was the ablest general on the Union side during the war, replied emphatically: &quot;McClellan, by all odds!&quot;

While McClellan&#x27;s reputation has suffered over time, especially over the later half of the 20th century, there is a small but intense cadre of Civil War historians who believe that the general has been poorly served in at least four regards. First, McClellan proponents say that because the general was a conservative Democrat with great personal charisma, radical Republicans fearing his political potential deliberately undermined his field operations. Second, that as the radical Republicans were the true winners coming out of the Civil War, they were able to write its history, placing their principal political rival of the time, McClellan, in the worst possible light. Third, that historians eager to jump on the bandwagon of Lincoln as America&#x27;s greatest political icon worked to outdo one another in shifting blame for early military failures from Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to McClellan. And fourth, that Lincoln and Stanton deliberately undermined McClellan because of his conciliatory stance towards the South, which might have resulted in a less destructive end to the war had Richmond fallen as a result of the Peninsula Campaign. Proponents of this school claim that McClellan is criticized more for his admittedly abrasive personality than for his actual field performance.

Several geographic features and establishments have been named for George B. McClellan. These include Fort McClellan in Alabama, McClellan Butte and McClellan Peak in the state of Washington, where he traveled while conducting the Pacific Railroad Survey in 1853, and a bronze equestrian statue honoring General McClellan in Washington, D.C. Another equestrian statue honors him in front of Philadelphia City Hall, while the McClellan Gate at Arlington National Cemetery is dedicated to him and displays his name. McClellan Park in Milbridge, Maine, was donated to the town by the general&#x27;s son with the stipulation that it be named for the general. Camp McClellan, in Davenport, Iowa is a former Union Army camp established in August 1861 after the outbreak of the Civil War. The camp was the training grounds for recruits and a hospital for the wounded. McClellan Fitness Center is a United States Army gym located at Fort Eustis, Virginia near his Peninsula Campaign.

The Fire Department of New York operated a fireboat named &quot;George B. McClellan&quot; from 1904 to 1954, but this vessel was actually named after McClellan&#x27;s son, who was Mayor of New York City, when the vessel was launched.

<doc id="104981" wikidata="Q1049033" url="?curid=104981" title="Peggy Guggenheim Collection">
<text>The Peggy Guggenheim Collection is an art museum on the Grand Canal in the Dorsoduro &quot;sestiere&quot; of Venice, Italy. It is one of the most visited attractions in Venice. The collection is housed in the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni, an 18th-century palace, which was the home of the American heiress Peggy Guggenheim for three decades. She began displaying her private collection of modern artworks to the public seasonally in 1951. After her death in 1979, it passed to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, which opened the collection year-round from 1980.

The collection includes works of prominent Italian futurists and American modernists working in such genres as Cubism, Surrealism and abstract expressionism. It also includes sculptural works. In 2017, Karole Vail, a granddaughter of Peggy Guggenheim, was appointed the director of the collection, succeeding Philip Rylands, who led the museum for 37 years.

==Collection==

The collection is principally based on the personal art collection of Peggy Guggenheim, a former wife of artist Max Ernst and a niece of the mining magnate, Solomon R. Guggenheim. She collected the artworks mostly between 1938 and 1946, buying works in Europe &quot;in dizzying succession&quot; as World War II began, and later in America, where she discovered the talent of Jackson Pollock, among others. The museum &quot;houses an impressive selection of modern art. Its picturesque setting and well-respected collection attract some 400,000 visitors per year&quot;, making it &quot;the most-visited site in Venice after the Doge&#x27;s Palace&quot;. Works on display include those of prominent Italian futurists and American modernists. Pieces in the collection embrace Cubism, Surrealism and abstract expressionism. During Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s 30-year residence in Venice, her collection was seen at her home in the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni and at special exhibitions in Amsterdam (1950), Zürich (1951), London (1964), Stockholm (1966), Copenhagen (1966), New York (1969) and Paris (1974).

Among the artists represented in the collection are: from Italy, Giorgio de Chirico (&quot;The Red Tower, The Nostalgia of the Poet&quot;) and Gino Severini (&quot;Sea Dancer&quot;); from France, Georges Braque (&quot;The Clarinet&quot;), Jean Metzinger (&quot;Au Vélodrome&quot;), Albert Gleizes (&quot;Woman with Animals&quot;), Marcel Duchamp (&quot;Sad Young Man on a Train&quot;), Fernand Léger (&quot;Study of a Nude&quot; and &quot;Men in the City&quot;), Francis Picabia (&quot;Very Rare Picture on Earth&quot;); from Spain, Salvador Dalí (&quot;Birth of Liquid Desires&quot;), Joan Miró (&quot;Seated Woman II&quot;) and Pablo Picasso (&quot;The Poet, On the Beach&quot;); from other European countries, Constantin Brâncuși (including a sculpture from the &quot;Bird in Space&quot; series), Max Ernst (&quot;The Kiss, Attirement of the Bride&quot;), Alberto Giacometti (&quot;Woman with Her Throat Cut, Woman Walking&quot;), Arshile Gorky (&quot;Untitled&quot;), Wassily Kandinsky (&quot;Landscape with Red Spots, No. 2, White Cross&quot;), Paul Klee (&quot;Magic Garden&quot;), René Magritte (&quot;Empire of Light&quot;) and Piet Mondrian (&quot;Composition No. 1 with Grey and Red 1938, Composition with Red 1939&quot;); and from the US, Alexander Calder (&quot;Arc of Petals&quot;) and Pollock (&quot;The Moon Woman, Alchemy&quot;). In one room, the museum also exhibits a few paintings by Peggy&#x27;s daughter Pegeen Vail Guggenheim.

In addition to the permanent collection, the museum houses 26 works on long-term loan from the Gianni Mattioli Collection, including images of Italian futurism by artists including Umberto Boccioni (&quot;Materia&quot;, &quot;Dynamism of a Cyclist&quot;), Carlo Carrà (&quot;Interventionist Demonstration&quot;), Luigi Russolo (&quot;The Solidity of Fog&quot;) and Severini (&quot;Blue Dancer&quot;), as well as works by Giacomo Balla, Fortunato Depero, Ottone Rosai, Mario Sironi and Ardengo Soffici. In 2012, the museum received 83 works from the Rudolph and Hannelore Schulhof Collection, which has its own gallery within the building.

==Building and Venice Biennale==
The collection is housed in the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni, which Peggy Guggenheim purchased in 1949. Although sometimes mistaken for a modern building, it is an 18th-century palace designed by the Venetian architect . The building was unfinished, and has an unusually low elevation on the Grand Canal. The museum&#x27;s website describes it thus:

The palazzo was Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s home for thirty years. In 1951, the palazzo, its garden, now called the Nasher Sculpture Garden, and her art collection were opened to the public from April to October for viewing. Her collection at the palazzo remained open during the summers until her death in Camposampiero, northern Italy, in 1979; she had donated the palazzo and the 300-piece collection to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1976. The foundation, then under the direction of Peter Lawson-Johnston, took control of the palazzo and the collection in 1979 and re-opened the collection there in April 1980 as the Peggy Guggenheim Collection.

After the Foundation took control of the building in 1979, it took steps to expand gallery space; by 1985, &quot;all of the rooms on the main floor had been converted into galleries ... the white Istrian stone facade and the unique canal terrace had been restored&quot; and a protruding arcade wing, called the barchessa, had been rebuilt by architect Giorgio Bellavitis. Since 1985, the museum has been open year-round. In 1993, apartments adjacent to the museum were converted to a garden annex, a shop and more galleries. In 1995, the Nasher Sculpture Garden was completed, additional exhibition rooms were added, and a café was opened. A few years later, in 1999 and in 2000, the two neighboring properties were acquired. In 2003, a new entrance and booking office opened to cope with the increasing number of visitors, which reached 350,000 in 2007. Since 1993, the museum has doubled in size, from 2,000 to 4,000 square meters.

Since 1985, the United States has selected the foundation to operate the U.S. Pavilion of the Venice Biennale, an exhibition held every other summer. In 1986, the foundation purchased the Palladian-style pavilion, built in 1930.

==Management and attendance==
Philip Rylands led the museum for 37 years after Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s death, until 2017. He was appointed the first director of the collection in 2000, and in 2017 he became director emeritus. In 2017, Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s granddaughter, Karole P. B. Vail, succeeded Rylands after having been a curator at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York since 1997.

As of 2012, the collection was the most visited art gallery in Venice and the 11th most visited in Italy.

==Lawsuits==
Since 1992, Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s grandson Sandro Rumney, together with his children and some cousins, have raised several disputes with the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. The disputes concern, in part, the difference in language between Guggenheim&#x27;s unconditional 1976 deed of gift to the foundation, a 1969 letter, and a 1972 version of her will. The courts have found the deed binding. In 1992, Rumney and two other grandsons sued the foundation in Paris. They claimed, among other things, that the modernization of the collection did not comply with the letter and spirit of her wishes. In 1994, the court dismissed the claims and ordered the grandsons to pay the foundation court costs.

Following the gift of approximately 80 works to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation by Hannelore and Rudolph Schulhof (a former trustee of the foundation) in 2012, some works collected by Guggenheim were removed from the Palazzo to make room for the display of the new works. The Schulhofs&#x27; names were inscribed alongside Guggenheim&#x27;s at both entrances of the museum. Their son, Michael P. Schulhof, has been a trustee of the Guggenheim foundation since 2009. In 2014, several French descendants of Peggy Guggenheim, led by Rumney, sued the foundation for violating her will and agreements with the foundation, which they said require that her collection &quot;remain intact and on display&quot;. They also claimed that the resting place of her ashes in the gardens of the Palazzo has been desecrated by the display of sculptures nearby, among other things. The lawsuit requested that the founder&#x27;s bequest be revoked or that the collections, gravesite and signage be restored. Other descendants of Peggy Guggenheim supported the foundation&#x27;s position. In 2014, the court dismissed the claims and awarded the foundation legal fees. The court noted that the descendants had attended some of the parties held in the gardens by the foundation. In 2015, the Paris Court of Appeal dismissed the lawsuit and awarded the foundation additional legal fees. Rumney stated his intention to continue to appeal.

<doc id="104983" wikidata="Q2044143" url="?curid=104983" title="Civilian casualty">
<text>A civilian casualty occurs when a civilian is killed or injured by non-civilians, mostly law enforcement officers, military personnel, rebel group forces, or terrorists. Under the law of war, it refers to civilians who perish or suffer wounds as a result of wartime acts. The term is generally applied to situations in which violence is committed in pursuit of political goals. During periods of armed conflict, there are structures, actors, and processes at a number of levels that affect the likelihood of violence against civilians.

The term &quot;civilian casualties&quot; is sometimes used in non-military situations, for example to distinguish casualties to police vs. to criminals such as bank robbers.

==Overview==

In times of armed conflict, despite numerous advancements in technology, the European Union&#x27;s European Security Strategy, adopted by the European Council in Brussels in December 2003, stated that since 1990, almost 4 million people have died in wars, 90% of them civilians. However, United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF) reports that civilian fatalities have climbed from 5 per cent at the turn of the century to more than 90 per cent in the wars of the 1990s.

Generating reliable assessments of casualties of war is a notoriously complex process. Civilian casualties present particular difficulties. One problem is that the attribution of the label &#x27;civilian&#x27; is contested in some cases. On the surface, the definition of a civilian, at least in the context of international armed conflicts, is relatively simple: a civilian is any person who is not a member of the armed forces and is not a combatant in situation of armed conflict. To make effective use of such statistics as there are about civilian casualties of war, it is necessary to be explicit about the criteria for inclusion. All too often, there is a lack of clarity about which of the following categories of civilian casualties are included in any given set of figures.
# Those killed as a direct effect of war;
# Those injured as a direct effect of war;
# Those dying, whether during or after a war, from indirect effects of war such as disease, malnutrition and lawlessness, and who would not have been expected to die at such rates from such causes in the absence of the war;
# Victims of one-sided violence, such as when states slaughter their own citizens in connection with a war; 
# Victims of rape and other forms of sexual violence in connection with a war;
# Those uprooted in a war – that is, refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs);
# Those who, even after a war is over, die prematurely from injuries sustained in war.

The inclusion of people in each of these categories may be defensible, but needs to be explicit. Each category presents its own methodological problems. In the case of people dying from indirect effects (category 3), much careful work is needed to distinguish between &#x27;expected&#x27; and &#x27;excess&#x27; levels of mortality. In the case of victims of sexual crimes (category 5) there could be an argument for including not only direct crimes by combatants, but also &#x27;indirect&#x27; crimes due to general social collapse. In the case of those uprooted in war (category 6), the implication that refugees and IDPs always count as war victims is too simple. Some may be fleeing one-sided violence from a repressive state apparatus, natural calamity, or general social breakdown. Moreover, in certain episodes, such as the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Kosovo War of 1999, and the Afghanistan War of 2001, military campaigns have enabled large numbers of refugees to return home. Indeed, in the 1971 and 1999 wars, refugee return was a stated reason for launching hostilities. Yet this key observation finds remarkably little reflection in the literature about the casualties of contemporary war. A focus on the numbers of those uprooted in war is especially problematic as those who are trapped in conflict zones may in fact be worse off than those uprooted, but seldom feature in statistics. Figures for war deaths and for war-related migration should be presented separately, not amalgamated.

==International humanitarian law==

Following World War II, a series of treaties governing the laws of war were adopted starting in 1949. These Geneva Conventions would come into force, in no small part, because of a general reaction against the practices of the Second World War. Although the Fourth Geneva Convention attempted to erect some legal defenses for civilians in international armed conflicts, the bulk of the Fourth Convention devoted to explicating civilian rights in the hands of the enemy, and no explicit attention is paid to the problems of bombardment and the hazardous effects in the combat-zone.

In 1977, Protocol I was adopted as an amendment to the Geneva Conventions, prohibiting the deliberate or indiscriminate attack of civilians and civilian objects in international armed conflicts; the attacking force must take precautions and steps to spare the lives of civilians and civilian objects as possible. Although ratified by 173 countries, the only countries that are currently not signatories to Protocol I are the United States, Israel, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Turkey.

Under international humanitarian law applicable to international armed conflict, enemy civilians and stateless persons or neutral nationals outside the territory of a belligerent state are protected persons under of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the 1907 Fifth and 13th Hague Conventions regarding the duties of neutrals on land and naval warfare. Only neutral nationals in the territory of a belligerent state (e.g., the taking of U.S. residents in Iraq hostage by Iraqi authorities during the Gulf War before January 17, 1991) and citizens of an allied state (such as rapes committed by French colonial troops against allied Italian civilians after the Battle of Monte Cassino during World War II) are not protected persons under the laws of war.

The Rome Statute defines &quot;intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population&quot; in both international and non-international conflicts as illegal, but it only came into effect on 1 July 2002 and has not been ratified by every country.

== Ethics ==
Many modern nations&#x27; views on the ethics of civilian casualties align with the Just War theory, which advocates a system of proportionality. An act of war is deemed proportional in Just War theory if the overall destruction expected from the use of force is outweighed by the projected good to be achieved. This view is a war-adapted version of utilitarianism, the moral system which advocates that the morally correct action is the one that does the most good.

However, moral philosophers often contest this approach to war. Such theorists advocate absolutism, which holds there are various ethical rules that are, as the name implies, absolute. One such rule is that protected non-combatants cannot be attacked because they are, by definition, not partaking in combat; to attack non-combatants anyway, regardless of the expected outcome, is to deny them agency. Thus, by the absolutist view, only enemy combatants can be attacked. The philosopher Thomas Nagel advocates this absolutist rule in his essay &quot;War and Massacre&quot;.

Finally, the approach of pacifism is the belief that war of any kind is morally unjust. Pacifists sometimes extend humanitarian concern not just to enemy civilians but also to enemy combatants, especially conscripts.

===Refugees===
The laws of war have changed over the course of history, and international protocols like the Fourth Geneva Convention explicitly provide legal protections to protected civilians in territories belonging to or occupied by a belligerent party during and after an international armed conflict. The 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees has also given protection to people who have a well founded fear of persecution.

Some researchers have included refugees and internally displaced persons in their definition of &quot;civilian casualty&quot;.

==Civilian casualty ratio==

The civilian casualty ratio in an armed conflict is the ratio of civilian casualties to combatant casualties or total casualties. The measurement can apply either to casualties inflicted by a particular belligerent or to casualties in the conflict as a whole.

==Collateral damage==

Collateral damage is defined in terms of armed conflict as unavoidable or accidental killing or injury of non-combatants or unavoidable or accidental destruction of non-combatant property caused by attacks on legitimate military targets.

<doc id="104984" wikidata="Q387638" url="?curid=104984" title="Rocky IV">
<text>Rocky IV is a 1985 American sports drama film starring, written and directed by Sylvester Stallone. The film is the sequel to &quot;Rocky III&quot; (1982) and the fourth installment in the &quot;Rocky&quot; film series. It also stars Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Brigitte Nielsen, and Dolph Lundgren. In the film, Rocky Balboa (Stallone) confronts Ivan Drago (Lundgren), a Soviet boxer responsible for another personal tragedy in Balboa&#x27;s life.

Development for a fourth &quot;Rocky&quot; film began soon after the success of &quot;Rocky III&quot;. Principal photography began in 1984, with filming locations including Philadelphia, Wyoming, and Vancouver. &quot;Rocky IV&quot; was Lundgren&#x27;s American film debut, and Stallone&#x27;s last directorial effort until 2006; they engaged in authentic punching in their fight scenes, which led to Stallone being admitted to intensive care. Filming also featured new special effects and bona fide, groundbreaking sport methods and equipment, some of which were years removed from public use. &quot;Rocky IV&quot; is known for its strong Cold War themes, as well as its successful theme songs &quot;Burning Heart&quot; and &quot;Living in America&quot;.

&quot;Rocky IV&quot; premiered in Los Angeles on November 21, 1985, and was theatrically released in the United States by MGM/UA Entertainment Co. under its United Artists label on November 27. The film received mixed reviews, with praise for Drago&#x27;s credibility as a villain, but criticised the predictable screenplay. Scholars note that Drago&#x27;s ultimate defeat and the Soviet crowd&#x27;s embrace of Rocky represented the dissolution of the Soviet Union, while others criticized the film as propaganda through its Cold War themes and negative portrayals of Russians.

The film was a box office success, grossing $300.5 million worldwide, becoming the highest grossing film in the franchise and the third highest-grossing film of 1985 domestically and the second highest grossing film worldwide. Critical reception of the film became more favorable in the years later, with praise for the training montages. The film has been considered an icon of 1980s pop culture. In 2021, a director&#x27;s cut was released with the title Rocky IV: Rocky vs Drago, receiving positive reviews from critics. The sequel, &quot;Rocky V&quot;, was released in 1990.

==Plot==

In 1985, Russian boxer Ivan Drago arrives in the United States from the Soviet Union with his wife, his trainers and his manager, Nicoli Koloff. Koloff takes every opportunity to promote Drago&#x27;s athleticism as a hallmark of Soviet superiority. Motivated by patriotism and a desire to step back in the ring, former heavyweight champion Apollo Creed challenges Drago to an exhibition fight. Rocky Balboa has reservations about his much larger opponent and about Creed coming out of retirement but agrees to help train Apollo for the match.

The boxing exhibition takes place at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas. Apollo enters the ring in an over-the-top patriotic entrance with James Brown performing &quot;Living in America&quot;, complete with showgirls. The bout starts tamely with Apollo landing several punches that are ineffective against Drago, but Drago suddenly retaliates with devastating effects. By the end of the first round, Rocky and Apollo&#x27;s trainer Duke plead with him to stop the match, but Apollo refuses to do so. Drago aggressively pummels him in the second round. Apollo falls after a particularly savage blow and lies twitching on the ground. After the match is called in Drago&#x27;s favor, he displays no contrition, commenting to the assembled media: &quot;If he dies, he dies.&quot; Apollo dies as a result of the blow.

Rocky decides to challenge Drago himself, but has to surrender his championship to do so. Drago&#x27;s camp agrees to an unsanctioned 15-round fight in the Soviet Union on Christmas Day, an arrangement meant to protect Drago from the threats of violence he has been receiving in the United States. Rocky travels to the Soviet Union without his wife Adrian due to her disapproval of the match, setting up his training base in a remote cabin in Krasnogourbinsk with only Duke and Paulie to accompany him. Duke opens up to Rocky, stating that he actually raised Apollo and that his death felt like a father losing his son, and expresses his faith in Rocky that he will emerge victorious. To prepare for the match, Drago uses high-tech equipment, a team of trainers and doctors monitoring his every movement, and regular doses of anabolic steroids. Rocky, on the other hand, does roadwork in deep snow over mountainous terrain and workouts utilizing antiquated farm equipment. Adrian arrives unexpectedly five days before the fight to give Rocky her support.

On the night of the match, Rocky enters to a hostile jeering crowd. Drago is introduced with cheers and an elaborate patriotic ceremony, with the Soviet general secretary and the Politburo in attendance. In contrast to his match with Apollo, Drago immediately goes on the offensive. Rocky takes a pounding in the first round, but toward the end of the second round he lands a right hook that cuts Drago&#x27;s left eye. Between rounds, Duke encourages Rocky by telling him he&#x27;s proven Drago is only human, and Drago comments to his trainers that Rocky &quot;is like a piece of iron.&quot;

The two boxers spend the next dozen rounds trading blows, with Rocky managing to hold his ground despite Drago&#x27;s best efforts. As the 12th round begins, the Russian crowd starts to cheer for Rocky. After Koloff berates Drago for not finishing the fight, Drago rebels, throwing him from the ring and directly addressing the Soviet leadership, stating he fights only for himself. In the final round, with both fighters exhausted, Rocky seizes an opening to unleash a series of blows that KOs Drago, avenging Apollo&#x27;s death.

Rocky gives a victory speech, acknowledging the crowd&#x27;s initial disdain of him, but points out that it changed to respect during the fight. He states that he thinks everybody can change, so there does not need to be any war. Rocky ends his speech by wishing his son a Merry Christmas and raises his arms into the air in victory as the crowd applauds.

LeRoy Neiman plays the ring announcer in the Creed-Drago match. Burgess Meredith appears as Mickey Goldmill in archive footage. Appearing as themselves are singer James Brown and commentators Stu Nahan, Warner Wolf, R. J. Adams, Barry Tompkins and Al Bandiero.

==Production==
===Casting===
Sportscaster Stu Nahan makes his fourth appearance in the series as commentator for the Creed–Drago fight. Warner Wolf replaces Bill Baldwin, who died following filming for &quot;Rocky III&quot;, as co-commentator. For the fight between Rocky and Drago, commentators Barry Tompkins and Al Bandiero portray themselves as USA Network broadcasters.

Apollo Creed&#x27;s wife Mary Anne (Sylvia Meals) made her second appearance in the series, the first being &quot;Rocky&quot; (portrayed by actress Lavelle Roby), although the character was mainly featured in &quot;Rocky II&quot;. Stallone&#x27;s future wife, Brigitte Nielsen, appeared as Drago&#x27;s wife, Ludmilla.

The Soviet premier in the sky box during the Rocky–Drago match, played by David Lloyd Austin, strongly resembles contemporary (and last) Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Austin later played Gorbachev in &quot;The Naked Gun&quot;, and Russian characters in other films.

===Filming===
Wyoming doubled for the frozen expanse of Russia. The small farm where Rocky lived and trained was in Jackson Hole,&lt;ref name=&quot;parentpreviews/about-the-morgans&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Grand Teton National Park was used for filming many of the outdoor sequences in the Soviet Union. The PNE Agrodome at Hastings Park in Vancouver, British Columbia served as the location of Rocky&#x27;s Moscow bout.

Sylvester Stallone has stated that the original punching scenes filmed between him and Dolph Lundgren in the first portion of the fight are completely authentic. Stallone wanted to capture a realistic scene and Lundgren agreed that they would engage in legitimate sparring. One particularly forceful punch to Stallone&#x27;s chest slammed his heart against his breastbone, causing the heart to swell. Stallone, suffering from labored breathing and a blood pressure over 200, was flown from the set in Vancouver, British Columbia to Saint John&#x27;s Regional Medical Center in Santa Monica, California and was forced into intensive care for eight days. Stallone later commented that he believed Lundgren had the athletic ability and talent to fight in the professional heavyweight division of boxing. Producer Winkler describes the exact same event in his autobiography, observing not Lundgren, rather, &quot;Sly took a punch from a stand-in fighter and ended up in the emergency room with his blood pressure dangerously high.&quot;

Additionally, Stallone has stated that Lundgren nearly forced Carl Weathers to quit during the filming of the Apollo vs. Drago exhibition fight. At one point in the filming of the scene, Lundgren tossed Weathers into the corner of the boxing ring. Weathers shouted profanities at Lundgren while leaving the ring and announced that he was calling his agent and quitting the movie. Only after Stallone forced the two actors to reconcile did filming continue. The event caused a four-day work stoppage, while Weathers was talked back into the part and Lundgren agreed to tone down his aggressiveness.

===Post-production===
&quot;Rocky IV&quot; is one of the few sport movies that applies genuine sound effects from actual punches, bona fide training methods created by boxing consultants, and a bevy of other new special effects. The film is recognized as being ahead of its time in its demonstration of groundbreaking high-tech sporting equipment, some of which was experimental and 20 years from public use. In 2012, Olympians Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte noted that the training sequences in &quot;Rocky IV&quot; inspired them to use a cabin similar to what the resourceful Balboa utilized in the film.

Paulie&#x27;s robot, a character that through the years has enjoyed a cult following of its own, was created by International Robotics Inc. in New York City. The robot&#x27;s initial voice was that of the company&#x27;s CEO, Robert Doornick. The robot is identified by its engineers as &quot;SICO&quot; and is/was a member of the Screen Actors Guild. It toured with James Brown in the 1980s. The robot was written into the movie after it had been used to help treat Stallone&#x27;s autistic son, Seargeoh.

==Music==
===Soundtrack===

The musical score for &quot;Rocky IV&quot; was composed by Vince DiCola, who would later compose the music for &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;. &quot;Rocky IV&quot; is the only film in the series prior to &quot;Creed&quot; not to feature original music by Bill Conti; however, it does feature arrangements of themes composed by Conti from previous films in the series, such as &quot;The Final Bell&quot;. Conti, who was too busy with the first two &quot;Karate Kid&quot; films at the time, would return for &quot;Rocky V&quot; and &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot;. Conti&#x27;s famous piece of music from the Rocky series, &quot;Gonna Fly Now&quot;, does not appear at all in &quot;Rocky IV&quot; (the first time in the series this happened), though a few bars of it are incorporated into DiCola&#x27;s training montage instrumental.

Songs from the movie include &quot;Living in America&quot; by James Brown, as well as music by John Cafferty (&quot;Heart&#x27;s on Fire&quot;, featuring Vince DiCola), Survivor, Kenny Loggins, and Robert Tepper. Four of these songs became U.S. chart hits, two of which reached the Top Five. Go West wrote &quot;One Way Street&quot; for the movie by request of Sylvester Stallone. Europe&#x27;s hit &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;, written earlier in the decade by lead singer Joey Tempest, is often incorrectly stated as being featured in the film due to its similarity to DiCola&#x27;s &quot;Training Montage.&quot; However, Europe&#x27;s track was not released as a single until late 1986, after &quot;Rocky IV&quot;&#x27;s release.

According to singer Peter Cetera, he originally wrote his best-selling solo single &quot;Glory of Love&quot; as the end title for this film, but was passed over by United Artists, and was instead subsequently used as the theme for &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot;.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Rocky IV&quot; premiered in Westwood, Los Angeles on November 21, 1985. It opened Wednesday, November 27 on 1,325 screens in the United States and Canada prior to the Thanksgiving holiday.

===Lawsuit===
The script development was the subject of a famous copyright lawsuit, &quot;Anderson v. Stallone&quot;. Timothy Anderson developed a treatment for &quot;Rocky IV&quot; on spec; after the studio decided not to buy his treatment, he sued when the resulting movie script was similar to his treatment. The court held that Anderson had prepared an unauthorized derivative work of the characters Stallone had developed in &quot;Rocky I&quot; through &quot;III&quot;, and thus no part of his infringing work was eligible for copyright restriction.

===Director&#x27;s cut===
In August 2020, Stallone announced that a director&#x27;s cut edition of the film would be released to commemorate the film&#x27;s 35th anniversary. Approximately 38 minutes of previously unreleased footage consisting of both new scenes and alternate takes was added to the film, including significant extensions of both fight scenes and the Apollo Creed funeral scene, in addition to a lengthier recap of &quot;Rocky III&quot; at the beginning of the film. A significant amount of original footage was removed or replaced to make way for these additions, as the director&#x27;s cut runs 93 minutes compared to the original cut&#x27;s 91 minutes.

One major cut was that of the scenes featuring Paulie&#x27;s robot. &quot;The robot is going to the junkyard forever, no more robot,&quot; Stallone commented. Robert Doornick, founder of International Robotics and the voice of the robot, commented that Stallone cut all of the robot scenes in the director&#x27;s cut to save money on royalty fees that were given to Doornick in the original cut. Scenes with Brigitte Nielsen playing Ludmilla, Ivan Drago&#x27;s wife, were also substantially diminished, particularly the scenes where she spoke for her husband at press conferences and her encounter with Apollo Creed&#x27;s wife in Las Vegas just before the tragic fight between Creed and Drago. Nielsen and Stallone were married in 1985, shortly after the film&#x27;s premiere, and divorced in 1987, which perhaps explains Stallone&#x27;s decision to now reduce the role of his ex-wife in the film. In contrast, additional minor scenes featuring Adrian and Drago&#x27;s manager Nicolai were added to the movie.

Other scenes from the 1985 version removed in the new cut include Balboa celebrating his wedding anniversary with Adrian and the Soviet regime leaders &quot;Mikhail Gorbachev&quot; applauding Rocky for his speech after winning the final fight, with them instead leaving the room, as well as the scene which Balboa says &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; at the end of the speech was diminished. The director&#x27;s cut also features the addition of some of Bill Conti&#x27;s musical themes from the previous films onto the soundtrack, and the toning down of sound effects, particularly the exaggerated punching sounds heard in the original cut. The new cut is also presented in an aspect ratio of 2.39:1 compared to the original&#x27;s 1.85:1.

The director&#x27;s cut, titled &quot;Rocky IV: Rocky vs. Drago – The Ultimate Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, had a one-night theatrical release on November 11, 2021, and was released in digital formats the following day. Unlike the original cut, the director&#x27;s cut was distributed through United Artists Releasing. A &quot;making of&quot; video was released on YouTube a week prior to the director&#x27;s cut release.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Over the 5-day Thanksgiving weekend, it grossed a non-summer record $31,770,105. In its fourth week of release it expanded to a then-record 2,232 screens. It spent a total of six weeks as the number one film at the US box office, staying on top through the Christmas and New Years period, and grossed a total of $127.8 million in United States and Canada, and $300.5 million worldwide, the most of any &quot;Rocky&quot; film. It was the highest-grossing sports film of all time, until &quot;The Blind Side&quot; (2009), which grossed $309 million (without accounting for inflation). It was also the highest-grossing fourth installment of a film in the United States and Canada, surpassing the record of &quot;Sudden Impact&quot; (1983). Its success led to other studios opening major films over the Thanksgiving holiday.

In the United Kingdom it also had a record opening, grossing £1,780,894 in its first five days.

Stallone has been quoted as saying the enormous financial success and fan-following of &quot;Rocky IV&quot; once had him envisioning another &quot;Rocky&quot; movie, devoted to Drago and his post-boxing life, with Balboa&#x27;s storyline running parallel to Drago&#x27;s. However, he noted the damage both boxers sustained in the fight made them &quot;incapable of reason&quot;, and thus instead planned &quot;Rocky V&quot; as a showcase of the dangers of boxing.

===Critical response===
====Theatrical cut (1985)====
&quot;Rocky IV&quot; has a 40% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 50 critics with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;&quot;Rocky IV&quot; inflates the action to absurd heights, but it ultimately rings hollow thanks to a story that hits the same basic beats as the first three entries in the franchise.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 40 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, stating that with this film the &quot;Rocky&quot; series began &quot;finally losing its legs. It&#x27;s been a long run, one hit movie after another, but &quot;Rocky IV&quot; is a last gasp, a film so predictable that viewing it is like watching one of those old sitcoms where the characters never change and the same situations turn up again and again.&quot; Ian Nathan of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film two out of five stars, calling the script a &quot;laughable turd&quot; and describing &quot;Rocky IV&quot; as &quot;the [film] where the &quot;Rocky&quot; series threw in the towel on the credibility.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars, and stated in his review, &quot;[Stallone] creates credible villains worthy of his heroic character.&quot;

====Director&#x27;s cut (2021)====
The new cut, entitled &quot;Rocky IV: Rocky vs. Drago&quot;, received better reviews from critics, mainly praising the fights (new choreography and sound), more dramatic tone and character development, but still criticising the plot. 

Jeremy Smith, from &quot;Polygon&quot;, stated: &quot;The triumph of Stallone’s director’s cut — with a pin-sharp focus on Apollo and Rocky’s relationship and its ruthless removal of anything which distracts — is that it not only nails the central message of the film, but the very point of it existing at all (montages aside)&quot;.

In her review for &quot;Empire&quot;, Terri White praised the clearer motivations in the director&#x27;s cut: &quot;It&#x27;s a much more sombre context for the film (and goes some way to recontextualising the first three outings) and serves to subdue its worst indulgences. Without the gills of excess breathing quite so hard, the story of Rocky then pledging to fight Drago in Russia on Christmas Day becomes clear: it&#x27;s not about solving the Cold War or even a simple revenge yarn wrapped in bombastic patriotism. Rocky needs to find a way to break free of the code. To find a way to change. Apollo couldn&#x27;t, it says now more explicitly, and he died because of it&quot;.

===Accolades===
Dolph Lundgren received acclaim for his performance as Ivan Drago. He won the Marshall Trophy for Best Actor at the Napierville Cinema Festival. &quot;Rocky IV&quot; also won Germany&#x27;s Golden Screen Award.

The film won five Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Actor (Sylvester Stallone, along with &quot;&quot;), Worst Director (Stallone), Worst Supporting Actress (Brigitte Nielsen), Worst New Star (Nielsen, and also for &quot;Red Sonja&quot;) and Worst Musical Score. It also received nominations for Worst Picture, Worst Supporting Actress (Talia Shire), Worst Supporting Actor (Burt Young) and Worst Screenplay.

===Analysis===
Scholars note that the film&#x27;s strong yet formulaic structure emphasizes the power of the individual, embodied by Rocky, the prototypically American hero who is inventive, determined, and idealistic. 
They contrast that with Ivan Drago&#x27;s hyperbolic characterization as a representation of Soviet power in the context of the latter part of the Cold War. Writer/director Stallone highlights the nationalistic overtones of the Balboa–Drago fight throughout the film, such as when Drago&#x27;s wife claims the United States is filled with &quot;threats of violence&quot; to her husband. Drago&#x27;s trainer comments that American society has become &quot;pathetic and weak&quot; and &quot;antagonistic and violent&quot;, which has been likened to a common fascist trope depicting an enemy both weak and strong at the same time. Drago represents the totalitarian regime, demonstrating his power when he topples an arrogant opponent (Creed). Later on, the radio announcer says, &quot;Ivan Drago is a man with an entire country in his corner.&quot;

===Reaction in Russia===
Russia&#x27;s state-run Russia Beyond published an article in 2021, detailing the trip of a Russian goodwill ambassador Katya Lycheva to America in the 1980s. In the article, it is claimed that she objected to the character Ivan Drago, saying that the film uses him to vilify the Russian people: &quot;In the movie &quot;Rocky IV&quot; there is not a word of truth about the Soviet Union. We don&#x27;t even have such faces.&quot; Russia Beyond quoted an alleged American journalist saying: &quot;What this film can be blamed for is the constant and shameless pressure on the audience to treat the Russians and their government with contempt, pity and disgust&quot;. In 2020, Russia&#x27;s &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine ranked the film 8th in the list of &quot;12 most delusional films about Russia&quot;, noting that &quot;cinema takes its grudge against the most unpleasant, pre-Gorbachev Soviet realities. […] Soviet sports and party apparatchiks are portrayed in the film with incredible poison and malice&quot;.

==Other media==
===Sequel===

A sequel titled &quot;Rocky V&quot;, was released in November 16, 1990.

===Novelization===
A novelization was published by Ballantine Books in 1985. Sylvester Stallone was credited as the author. The novel included some backstory for Drago and his wife. Drago was a former coal miner who had come to the government&#x27;s attention after being featured in a Party promotional film about mining. Ludmilla, born in Kiev to a Party official, had begun training to become a swimming Olympic champion when she was nine.

===Video games===
In 1987, &quot;Rocky&quot; was released, based on the first four &quot;Rocky&quot; films. 2002 saw the release of &quot;Rocky&quot;, based on the first five &quot;Rocky&quot; films. 2004 saw the release of &quot;Rocky Legends&quot;, also based on the first five &quot;Rocky&quot; films.

===&quot;Creed II&quot;===
Sylvester Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, and Brigitte Nielsen reprise their roles from &quot;Rocky IV&quot; in &quot;Creed II&quot;, the sequel to the 2015 film &quot;Creed&quot;. The plot involves Drago&#x27;s son Viktor fighting Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) for his title as a way of his father Ivan regaining some of the prestige he lost after his defeat in &quot;Rocky IV.&quot;

<doc id="104986" wikidata="Q971436" url="?curid=104986" title="Isidore de Lara">
<text>Isidore de Lara, born Isidore Cohen (9 August 18582 September 1935), was an English composer and singer. After studying in Italy and France, he returned to England, where he taught for several years at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and became a well known singer and composer of art songs. In the early 1880s he began to compose music for the stage, eventually achieving his greatest successes with opera in Monte Carlo from the late 1890s through the outbreak of World War I. His most popular opera, &quot;Messaline&quot; (1899), enjoyed frequent revivals throughout Europe and in the United States during the first quarter of the 20th century. He returned to London and spent much of the 1920s trying to create a permanent National opera company in England, without much success.

==Biography==
Born in London, de Lara went to Milan in 1874 to study composition with Alberto Mazzucato and singing with Francesco Lamperti at the Milan Conservatory. In 1876 he went to Paris to study with Édouard Lalo. The following year he returned to London to take a position as a professor of singing at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He became known as a concert singer and a writer of vocal songs, of which his &quot;The Garden of Sleep&quot; (1877) and &quot;After Silent Years&quot; (1887) were particularly popular.

In the early 1880s, de Lara began to switch his attention to composing music for the theatre. His first opera, &quot;The Royal Word&quot;, premiered at the Gaiety Theatre, London on 17 April 1883 with de Lara portraying the role of Charles II of England. This was soon followed by &quot;Wrong Notes&quot; (1883) and &quot;Minna, or The Fall from the Cliff&quot; (1886). A few years later the acclaimed French baritone Victor Maurel persuaded him to turn his cantata &quot;The Light of Asia&quot;, based on the life of Buddha, into an Italian opera, &quot;La luce dell&#x27;Asia&quot;, which was produced at Covent Garden in 1892.

In 1893 de Lara&#x27;s opera &quot;Amy Robsart&quot; was given in French at Covent Garden with Emma Calvé. Well received, the work was staged the following year at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo. While in Monte Carlo, De Lara met Princess Alice of Monaco who became a close friend, patron and, eventually, lover.

Under her support, De Lara remained in Monaco and moved into the most successful part of his career. His opera &quot;Moïna&quot; was produced there in 1897. It was followed in 1899 by his most famous work, &quot;Messaline&quot;, which featured the presence of the greatest Italian heroic tenor of the era, Francesco Tamagno, in the cast of the premiere performance. &quot;Messaline&quot; proved very popular and was the inspiration for Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s painting of the same name. Notably, it was the first opera by an English composer to be mounted at La Scala (in 1901).

With the outbreak of World War I, de Lara returned to London. Concerned for the survival of the arts during this time, he established a fund for the relief of distressed musicians. At the close of the war, he strove to establish an English national opera throughout the 1920s, but was unable to get the financial support needed to maintain a permanent company. He retired to Paris where he died on 2 August 1935.

==Works==
De Lara was a moderately prolific composer, producing a total of 13 operas, 67 vocal art songs, and a small amount of chamber music. His musical style was highly eclectic, although the influences of Jules Massenet and Camille Saint-Saëns are readily apparent within his operas. Musicologist Nigel Burton wrote, &quot;His style may be said to have developed, but it never really settled down.&quot; The somewhat erratic side to his writing was a weakness and a strength. The fluctuating musical vocabulary in his writing enabled him to create any attitude, emotion, or impression at a moment&#x27;s notice, but at times the musical effects seem out of place or without cause; a criticism also made of Giacomo Meyerbeer. Critics have also commented on de Lara&#x27;s tendency towards over sentimentality. As one critic said, &quot;at the moments when the music should attempt to rise to dramatic greatness, it degenerates into synthetic posturings.&quot; However, de Lara by all accounts had a wonderful musical ear and at his best he is a fine composer. Perhaps de Lara&#x27;s strongest area was his skill at orchestration which was both tasteful and highly creative at the same time.

<doc id="104987" wikidata="Q1969967" url="?curid=104987" title="Steven Wright">
<text>Steven Alexander Wright (born December 6, 1955) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and film producer. He is known for his distinctive lethargic voice and slow, deadpan delivery of ironic, philosophical and sometimes nonsensical jokes, paraprosdokians, non sequiturs, anti-humor, and one-liners with contrived situations.

Wright was ranked as the 15th Greatest Comedian by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in its 2017 list of the 50 Greatest Stand-up Comics. His accolades include the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for starring in, writing, and producing the short film &quot;The Appointments of Dennis Jennings&quot; (1988) and two Primetime Emmy Awards nominations as a producer of &quot;Louie&quot; (2010–2015). He had a supporting role as Leon in the Peabody Award–winning tragicomedy web series &quot;Horace and Pete&quot;.

== Early life, family and education ==
Wright was born at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and grew up in Burlington, Massachusetts, one of four children of Lucille &quot;Dolly&quot; (née Lomano) and Alexander K. Wright. He was raised Catholic. His mother was Italian American, and his father of Scottish descent. Wright&#x27;s father worked as an electronics technician who &quot;tested a lot of stuff&quot; for NASA during the Apollo spacecraft program. When that program ended, he worked as a truck driver.

Wright attended Middlesex Community College in Bedford, Massachusetts, for two years to earn his associate degree, then continued his education at Emerson College. He graduated from Emerson in 1978.

==Career==
Wright began performing stand-up comedy in 1979 at the Comedy Connection in Boston. Wright cites stand-up comic George Carlin and director and former stand-up comic Woody Allen as comedic influences. In 1982, Peter Lassally, executive producer of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, saw Wright performing on a bill with other local comics at the Ding Ho comedy club in Cambridge, a venue Wright described as &quot;half Chinese restaurant and half comedy club. It was a pretty weird place.&quot; Lassally booked Wright on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and Wright so impressed host Johnny Carson and the studio audience that less than a week later he was invited to appear on the show again.

=== Stand-up success ===
Wright&#x27;s 1985 comedy album &quot;I Have a Pony&quot; was released on Warner Bros. Records, received critical acclaim and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. The album&#x27;s success landed him an HBO special, in the &quot;On Location:&quot; series, taped at &quot;Wolfgang&#x27;s&quot; in San Francisco. It was broadcast as &quot;A Steven Wright Special.&quot;

By then Wright had firmly developed a new brand of obscure, laid-back performing and was rapidly building a cultlike following and an onstage persona characterized by an aura of obscurity, with his penchant for non sequiturs and impassive, slow delivery adding to his mystique. The performance became one of HBO&#x27;s longest-running and most requested comedy specials and propelled him to great success on the college-arena concert circuit.

===Continued success beyond stand-up===
In 1989, Wright and fellow producer Dean Parisot won an Academy Award for their 30-minute short film &quot;The Appointments of Dennis Jennings&quot;, directed by Parisot, written by Mike Armstrong and Wright, and starring Wright and Rowan Atkinson. Upon accepting the Oscar, Wright said, &quot;We&#x27;re really glad that we cut out the other sixty minutes.&quot; In 1992, Wright had a recurring role on the television sitcom &quot;Mad About You&quot;. He also supplied the voice of the radio DJ in writer-director Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s film &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; that year. &quot;Dean Parisot&#x27;s wife Sally Menke is Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s [film] editor, so when she was editing the movie and it was getting down toward the end where they didn&#x27;t have the radio DJ yet, she thought of me and told Quentin and he liked the idea,&quot; Wright explained in 2009.

In 1995, Wright provided voiceover work for TBS&#x27;s Disaster Area cartoon block.

Numerous lists of jokes attributed to Wright circulate on the Internet, sometimes of dubious origin. Wright has said, &quot;Someone showed me a site, and half of it that said I wrote it, I didn&#x27;t write. Recently, I saw one, and I didn&#x27;t write any of it. What&#x27;s disturbing is that with a few of these jokes, I wish I had thought of them. A giant amount of them, I&#x27;m embarrassed that people think I thought of them because some are really bad.&quot;

After his 1990 comedy special &quot;Wicker Chairs and Gravity&quot;, Wright continued to do stand-up performances, but these were largely absent from television, and he only occasionally made guest spots on late-night talk shows. In 1999, he wrote and directed the 30-minute short &quot;One Soldier&quot;, saying it&#x27;s &quot;about a soldier who was in the Civil War, right after the war, with all these existentialist thoughts and wondering if there is a God and all that stuff.&quot;

In May 2000, Wright and other Ding Ho alumni, including Lenny Clarke, Barry Crimmins, Steve Sweeney, Bill Sohonage and Jimmy Tingle, appeared at a reunion benefit for comic Bob Lazarus, who was diagnosed with leukemia.

In 2006, Wright produced his first stand-up special in 16 years, &quot;Steven Wright: When the Leaves Blow Away&quot;, originally aired on Comedy Central on October 21, 2006. On September 25, 2007, Wright released his second album, &quot;I Still Have a Pony&quot;, a CD release of the material from &quot;When The Leaves Blow Away&quot;. It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album.

Beginning in 2008, Wright occasionally appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; as a visiting celebrity, often dropping by to help with the fan-mail segment. He joined a small cadre of Hollywood comedy celebrities who supported the show.

<doc id="104990" wikidata="Q7452501" url="?curid=104990" title="Sequential art">
<text>In comics studies, sequential art is a term proposed by comics artist Will Eisner to describe art forms that use images deployed in a specific order for the purpose of graphic storytelling (i.e., narration of graphic stories) or conveying information. The best-known example of sequential art is comics.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;sequential art&quot; was coined in 1985 by comics artist Will Eisner in his book &quot;Comics and Sequential Art&quot;. Eisner analyzed this form into four elements: design, drawing, caricature, and writing.

Scott McCloud, another comics artist, elaborated the explanation further, in his books &quot;Understanding Comics&quot; (1993) and &quot;Reinventing Comics&quot; (2000). In &quot;Understanding Comics&quot;, he notes that the movie roll, before it is being projected, arguably could be seen as a very slow comic.

Related terms include: visual narrative, graphic narrative, pictorial narrative, picto-narrative, sequential narrative, sequential pictorial narrative, sequential storytelling, graphic fiction, graphic literature, pictorial literature, sequential literature, and narrative illustration. The related term sequential sculpture&quot;&#x27; has also been used.

<doc id="104994" wikidata="Q14366" url="?curid=104994" title="Ticino (river)">
<text>The river Ticino ( , ; ; French and ; ) is the most important perennial left-bank tributary of the Po. It has given its name to the Swiss canton through which its upper portion flows.

It is one of the four major rivers taking their source in the Gotthard region, along with the Rhône, Reuss and Rhine.
The river rises in the Val Bedretto in Switzerland at the frontier between the cantons of Valais and Ticino right below the Nufenen Pass, is fed by the glaciers of the Alps and later flows through Lake Maggiore, which traverses the border to Italy. The Ticino joins the Po a few kilometres downstream (along the Ticino) from Pavia. It is about long. The stretch of river between Lake Maggiore and the confluence in the Po is included in the Parco naturale lombardo della Valle del Ticino, a Nature reserve included by UNESCO in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves.

==Name==

The name may have meant &quot;the runner,&quot; from Proto-Indo-European *tekʷ-ino-s, from *tekʷ- (“to run, flow”).

==Course==
The Ticino arises from the many torrents that drain the mountain flanks on the eastern side of Nufenen Pass in the upper Val Bedretto. From here, the river flows to the north-east through the Val Bedretto to Airolo () where the south ramp of the St Gotthard Pass and south portals of both the Gotthard Railway Tunnel and the Gotthard Road Tunnel are located. Then it turns slowly to the southeast while entering the Valle Leventina. In the Leventina, the Ticino flows through three terrain steps separated by two narrow gorges (&quot;Gola di Monte Piottino&quot; and &quot;Biaschina&quot;) and finally reaches the canton&#x27;s floor near Bodio at around . Shortly after, at Biasca (), the river is joined by its first major tributary, the Brenno which flows from Passo del Lucomagno through the Valle di Blenio.

Before the Ticino passes west of the canton&#x27;s capital, Bellinzona, the river converges with its second larger left tributary, the Moesa, originating below the Passo del San Bernardino and flowing through the Valle Mesolcina. The Valle Mesolcina (and the Val Calanca) belongs geographically and culturally to the Ticino, but politically it is part of the canton of the Grisons. This part of the river valley between Biasca and Bellinzona is called the &quot;Riviera&quot;. The river is dammed after Bellinzona. Now the Ticino turns almost westwards and flows through the perfectly flat &quot;Piano di Magadino&quot;, an important cultivation and nature reserve area the river generated itself by its own sediments over ten thousands of years, before it enters the Lago Maggiore at the lowest point of Switzerland at .

Only about the first sixth of the lake lies in Switzerland. Four major tributaries join the Ticino in Lago Maggiore. The Verzasca and the Maggia enter the lake in Switzerland in Tenero and in Locarno/Ascona, respectively. The Tresa drains the Lago di Lugano and flows in Luino into Lago Maggiore. The Toce drains many valleys to the northwest of Lago Maggiore and joins the lake near Feriolo. It surpasses the Ticino in average discharge volume and contains the highest peak of the catchment area of the Ticino river system, the Grenzgipfel () in the Monte Rosa massif.

In Sesto Calende the river, now called Fiume Ticino, exits Lake Maggiore and meanders southwards, passing the Milano-Malpensa Airport in the east. Now slowly turning to the southeast, the river circumvents Milano at a distance of about in the east. Shortly before it converges with the Po in the south of Milano, it passes Pavia on its northern shore.

==History==
The legendary Gallic leader Bellovesus was said to have defeated the Etruscans here in circa 600 BC. Ticino was the location of the Battle of Ticinus, the first battle of the Second Punic War fought between the Carthaginian forces of Hannibal and the Romans under Publius Cornelius Scipio in November 218 BC.

In the Middle Ages Pavia (first capital of the Kingdom of the Lombards and then of the kingdom of Italy) was, thanks to the waters of the Ticino, a fundamental hub for communications and trade between Venice and the Po valley. Furthermore, still in Pavia, there was the only brick bridge (ponte Coperto) which until the 19th century crossed the Ticino from Lake Maggiore to the Po.

A wooden bridge was built by the Visconti in Vigevano in the early fourteenth century, but it was set on fire by the Pavia fleet in 1315, rebuilt by Luchino Visconti, it was destroyed again by the Pavia in 1356 and never rebuilt.

The Ticino was in the territory of the Duchy of Milan during much of the later medieval and early modern period, although its upper portion as far as Bellinzona in 1500 and as far as the shores of Lago Maggiore in 1513, fell to the Old Swiss Confederacy as a result of the Swiss campaigns in the Italian Wars.

==Towns and tributaries==
===Val Bedretto===

Val Bedretto, a narrow alpine valley named after the village of Bedretto, culminates in Nufenen Pass, (, ), at located between Pizzo Gallina (north, ) and Nufenenstock (south, ). The road up the valley is fairly straight until it approaches the pass, where the nine hairpin turns start.

The Ticino originates on both sides, north and south, of the Nufenenstock: A smaller tributary originates from a small mountain lake south of the Nufenenstock and north of the Piccolo Corno Gries () below the Passo del Corno at in the short valley of the same name. Until the beginning of the 20th century the Valaisinne Gries Glacier was still flowing over the Corno Pass into the Val Corno!

Both spring areas converges about where the hairpins of the eastern pass road begins to circumvent about in altitude. Through the passes and over the Nufenenstock runs the border between the cantons of Valais and Ticino.

A paved road constructed in 1964 goes over the Passo della Novena and after some ten hairpins down about in altitude on its western side and then through the Ägenental in northeasten direction ultimately leading to the Obergoms, the upper half of the valley of the uppermost part the Rhône course. While the lower part of the Valais speaks French, the upper part speaks its particular Highest Alemannic dialect, the Walliser German, the population of Ticino speaks Italian.

Subsequently, the Ticino becomes a mountain brook flowing straight down the valley to the hamlet of All&#x27;Acqua or All&#x27;Acqua Ospizio at , named for the hospice for travellers located there near the previous end of a drivable road in former centuries. Currently, it is a base for skiing and hiking. Further down eastwards the small villages of Ronco at and finally Bedretto () and Villa Bedretto appear.
Below Bedretto the Ri di Cristallina, &quot;Cristallina stream&quot;, a right tributary from the Val Torta, joins the Ticino at Ossasco, and further down the valley, Fontana is the lowest village in Val Bedretto. The entire area is laced with hiking trails and mountain huts. The valley is subject to avalanches and snow can remain on the ground as late as September.

<text>Fridays was a late-night live comedy show that aired on ABC on Friday nights from April 11, 1980, to April 23, 1982.

==Overview==

The program was ABC&#x27;s attempt to duplicate the success of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, which, at the time, was in its fifth season featuring the original &quot;Not Ready for Primetime&quot; cast, along with several writers (and &quot;SNL&quot; band leader at the time, Paul Shaffer) who had been promoted to feature player status, as well as newcomer Harry Shearer. Like &quot;SNL&quot;, &quot;Fridays&quot; featured popular musical guests and, beginning in the second season, celebrity guest hosts, some of whom had appeared on &quot;SNL&quot; before and after &quot;Fridays&quot; aired, such as Andy Kaufman, Billy Crystal, William Shatner, Mark Hamill, and George Carlin. (Carlin, who had hosted the very first &quot;SNL&quot; in 1975, was also &quot;Fridays&quot;″ first official &quot;guest host&quot; in 1981.)

The show featured many recurring characters and sketches, short films, and a parody news segment called &quot;Friday Edition&quot;, with Melanie Chartoff as the anchor (later joined by Rich Hall in seasons two and three). Veteran comedian Jack Burns served as show announcer and made on-screen appearances on the show. Initially, the show was compared unfavorably to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a weak clone that resorted to shock humor for laughs. The third episode (original airdate: April 25, 1980) was the last episode to air on some affiliates due to objectionable content concerning zombie gore and cannibalism (&quot;Diner of the Living Dead&quot;), disgusting habits (&quot;Women Who Spit&quot;), and blasphemous humor (&quot;The Inflatable Nun&quot;).

When &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s sixth season was met with negative reviews and low ratings over the new cast, new writers, and new showrunner Jean Doumanian, critics who once panned &quot;Fridays&quot; praised it, citing the show as being sharper, edgier and funnier than &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; at the time. Some critics attributed this to the sprawling, ambitious, and often pointed sociopolitical and situational sketches.

Some examples of this include:

*A Bing Crosby-Bob Hope buddy comedy parody about the United States&#x27; dealings with El Salvador (&quot;Road to El Salvador&quot;); 
*A &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; parody about refugees from an impoverished Central American country mistaking a &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine location scout and an American military invasion for extraterrestrials coming to save them (&quot;Close Encounters of the Third World&quot;);
*A Marx Brothers parody of Iran&#x27;s revolution (&quot;A Night in Tehran&quot;); 
*Palestinian radio DJs (played by Bruce Mahler and episode guest star George Carlin) broadcasting a morning show from a PLO bunker (&quot;K.P.L.O&quot;); 
*A live-action Robert Altman Popeye movie parody with Popeye (Mark Blankfield) and a band of first-wave hippies fighting back against a fascist regime led by Bluto (&quot;Popeye&#x27;s Got a Brand New Bag&quot;); 
*The US Founding Fathers worrying that the Second Amendment (&quot;The Right to Bear Arms&quot;) will be abused in the future while ignoring suggestions for amendments granting equal rights to women and African-Americans;
*A variety show run by the Moral Majority featuring a magician who makes minorities disappear, a top ten list of things the Moral Majority hate, and a punk band performing bowdlerized hits for conservatives (&quot;The Moral Majority Comedy Hour&quot;); 
*A parody of &quot;Altered States&quot; where Ronald Reagan (John Roarke) uses sensory deprivation and psychedelic mushrooms to find a way to bring America back to its glory days, but ends up transforming himself into Richard Nixon (&quot;Altered Statesman&quot;);
*A spaghetti western centered on the creationism vs. evolution argument featuring Don Novello as Father Guido Sarducci (&quot;A Fist Full of Darwin&quot;), and, 
*In what is considered the show&#x27;s magnum opus, a 17-minute parody of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; with Ronald Reagan (John Roarke) as Tim Curry&#x27;s Dr. Frank N. Furter creating the perfect Republican, who turns out to be a militant black man who leads Reagan&#x27;s followers in a revolution.

Unusual for a sketch comedy series at the time, &quot;Fridays&quot; occasionally featured serious interludes and dramatic sketches, such as a segment that aired soon after the 1981 assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan involving all nine of the cast members recalling where they were at the time of previous assassinations and attempts and a sketch where a punk rocker (Michael Richards) visits his father (John Roarke) who rejects him by yelling, &quot;Who are you?&quot; and &quot;I have no son!&quot;. After a long, heartfelt speech from the punk about how his father should accept that he is from a different generation and learn to love him, the punk discovers that the old man was right: they aren&#x27;t father and son because they have different hair and eye colors.

From its inception, &quot;Fridays&quot; embraced the emerging new wave rock music scene and its associated culture to a greater extent than &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; did at the time, widely incorporating it into their selection of musical guests, hosts and sketches. Unlike &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;Fridays&quot; did not have a show band on set. Pop art drawings were displayed and accompanied with a fuzz heavy electric guitar solo whenever the show went to and came back from commercial breaks, though season one featured cartoons by B. Kliban with some kind of pun as the punchline.

Three seasons of &quot;Fridays&quot; aired on ABC (see ). The last episode aired as a primetime sketch show. The show was originally 70 minutes in its first season. It was expanded to 90 minutes in seasons two and three.

&quot;SNL&quot; executive producer Dick Ebersol gave all &quot;Fridays&quot; cast members an offer to join &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1982, but most turned him down. Only Larry David, Kevin Kelton and Rich Hall worked on &quot;SNL&quot; for a short time after &quot;Fridays&quot; was completed (all of them worked on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; during its tenth season in 1984; Hall was a cast member while David and Kelton were writers).

AC/DC, The Clash and The Stray Cats made their American television debuts on &quot;Fridays&quot;. At the time of The Stray Cats&#x27; appearance, the band had yet to be signed by a record company. During the group&#x27;s performance, there was a crawl at the bottom of the screen inviting offers from record companies.

==Episodes==

===Andy Kaufman incident===
On the February 20, 1981, episode, Andy Kaufman was the host. During a sketch about couples at dinner sneaking away to the bathroom to smoke marijuana, Kaufman, who was known for causing trouble on live television, broke character and refused to read his lines (saying &quot;I can&#x27;t play stoned&quot;). Michael Richards got up from the table, grabbed the cue cards and threw them down on the table in front of Kaufman, who responded by dumping a glass of water on Richards. Some of the show&#x27;s cast and crew members (including Richards and Burns) became angry and a small brawl broke out on stage. Since the show was broadcast live, home viewers were able to see most of these events transpire until the network cut the cameras off. Kaufman returned the following week in a taped apology to home viewers. The incident was planned by Kaufman, who concocted it with his sidekick Bob Zmuda, and was meant as a prank. The only individuals aware of the plan were producer/director Moffitt, producer/announcer Burns, and the three comedians acting in the sketch along with Kaufman: Richards, Chartoff and Burrell. This incident was reenacted in the film &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; (1999), starring Jim Carrey as Kaufman, Zmuda as Burns, Norm Macdonald as Richards, Caroline Rhea as Chartoff and Mary Lynn Rajskub as Burrell.

===Cancellation===
The series ended in 1982 following ABC&#x27;s decision to expand &quot;Nightline&quot; to five nights a week, which moved &quot;Fridays&quot; to air at midnight instead of 11:30pm. This lasted from January through April 1982, after which the show was dropped from ABC&#x27;s schedule.

One final attempt was made by ABC to revive the show by putting it on in prime time, about a month after its final late-night broadcast. The sole prime-time episode of &quot;Fridays&quot; (broadcast on April 23, 1982) was scheduled against &quot;Dallas&quot;, which did nothing to help the show&#x27;s moribund ratings. The series was promptly canceled.

==Syndication and DVD release==
A few years after the show&#x27;s cancellation, &quot;Fridays&quot; appeared in reruns on the USA Network in the late 1980s. However, the episodes were edited down to 60 minutes (similar to how &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; is edited on cable reruns and NBC reruns that air at 10pm EST as filler). The reruns were pulled after a year.

&quot;A DVD release, said producer John Moffitt, was delayed because Richards&#x27; original contract gave him video approval rights and because David for years asked that the show not be made available because he was uncomfortable with the quality of his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;hC/fDVDs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;

&quot;According to Perrin, for many years a DVD edition of Fridays was blocked by Larry David, but finally a 4-disc set was released in 2013.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dm/jF1980&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time, a home video release of &quot;Fridays&quot; was considered out of the question, as cast member Michael Richards was said to have signed a deal stating that no episode would be released on any home video format. However, clips of sketches from the show (mostly sketches that featured Richards or David) surfaced on the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; season three DVD set in the bonus features set. Shout Factory announced plans to release all three seasons of the show on DVD in 2013. In August 2013, after missing their original release date, Shout Factory released a five disc best-of collection featuring highlights of 16 episodes from seasons one through three (not complete episodes). In 2015, Hulu Plus streamed select episodes from all three seasons (season one has episodes 1, 3, 8, and 10; season 2 has episodes 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 19, and 20; and season three has episodes 2, 4, 12, and 13). As of 2017, the show is no longer streaming on Hulu Plus, but the best-of DVD collection is still available for purchase, and the show&#x27;s episodes (which include the Hulu episodes and some episodes that weren&#x27;t featured on Hulu) can be streamed on Tubi TV and Shout! Factory.

<text>Michael Anthony Richards (born July 24, 1949) is an American actor and former stand-up comedian. He achieved global recognition for starring as Cosmo Kramer on the NBC television sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; from 1989 to 1998. He began his career as a stand-up comedian, first entering the national spotlight when he was featured on Billy Crystal&#x27;s first cable TV special, and went on to become a series regular on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Fridays&quot;.

From 1989 to 1998, he played Cosmo Kramer on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, three times receiving the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. During the run of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, he made a guest appearance in &quot;Mad About You&quot;, reprising his role as Kramer. Richards also made numerous guest appearances on a variety of television shows, such as &quot;Cheers&quot;. His film credits include &quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot;, &quot;Airheads&quot;, &quot;Young Doctors in Love&quot;, &quot;Problem Child&quot;, &quot;Coneheads&quot;, &quot;UHF&quot;, and &quot;Trial and Error&quot;, one of his few starring roles. In 2000, he starred in his own sitcom, &quot;The Michael Richards Show&quot;, which was canceled after only two months. 

In 2006, Richards was filmed going on a racist tirade against hecklers while performing at the Laugh Factory in California. After the tape was obtained and released by TMZ, significant backlash and media coverage led to Richards retiring from stand-up in early 2007. In 2009, he appeared as himself in the seventh season of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; alongside his fellow &quot;Seinfeld&quot; cast members for the first time since the show’s finale. In 2013, he portrayed Frank in the sitcom &quot;Kirstie&quot;, which was canceled after one season. He most recently played Daddy Hogwood in the 2019 romantic comedy &quot;Faith, Hope &amp; Love&quot;.

Richards was born in Culver City, California, to a Catholic family. He is the son of Phyllis (née Nardozzi), a medical records librarian. As a child, Richards was told his father was William Richards, an electrical engineer, who died in a car crash when Michael was two. He later learned his mother&#x27;s pregnancy was the result of a sexual assault and that she considered abortion and adoption before deciding to raise him as a single mother. Richards was also raised by a grandmother who suffered from schizophrenia.

Richards graduated from Thousand Oaks High School. In 1968, he appeared as a contestant on &quot;The Dating Game&quot; but was not chosen for a date. He was drafted into the United States Army in 1970. He trained as a medic and was stationed in West Germany, where he was a member of a theatrical group called The Training Road Show. He became interested in performing after taking a theatrical class in seventh grade.

After being honorably discharged, Richards used the benefits of the G.I. Bill to enroll in the California Institute of the Arts and earned a Bachelor of Arts in drama from the Evergreen State College in 1975. He also had a short-lived improv act with Ed Begley Jr. During this period, he enrolled at Los Angeles Valley College and continued to appear in student productions.

==Career==
=== 1979–1989: Early career ===

Richards got his big TV break in 1979, appearing in Billy Crystal&#x27;s first cable TV special. In 1980, he began as one of the cast members on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Fridays&quot; television show, where Larry David was a fellow cast member and writer. It included a famous instance in which Andy Kaufman refused to deliver his scripted lines, leading Richards to bring the cue cards on screen to Kaufman, who responded by throwing his drink into Richards&#x27; face, causing a small riot (Richards later claimed he was in on the joke). The film &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; featured a re-enactment of the Andy Kaufman incident where Richards was portrayed by actor Norm Macdonald.

In 1981, he appeared in the &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot; episode &quot;Desperate Hours&quot;. In 1986, Richards had a minor role in the cult satirical TV miniseries &quot;Fresno&quot;, playing one of a pair of inept criminal henchmen. That same year he auditioned to play Al Bundy in the TV series &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, but he was passed over for Ed O&#x27;Neill. In 1989, Richards had a supporting role in &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s comedy film &quot;UHF&quot; as janitor Stanley Spadowski. On television, he appeared in &quot;Miami Vice&quot; as an unscrupulous bookie; in &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; as a television producer making a documentary about Dr. Mark Craig; in &quot;Cheers&quot; as a character trying to collect on an old bet with Sam Malone; and made several guest appearances with Jay Leno as an accident-prone fitness expert.

According to an interview with executive producer David Hoberman, ABC first conceived the series &quot;Monk&quot; as a procedural police comedy with an Inspector Clouseau-like character suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder. Hoberman said ABC wanted Richards to play Adrian Monk, but he turned it down.

===1989–2005: &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and rise to prominence===
In 1989, Richards was cast as Cosmo Kramer in the NBC television series &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, created by fellow &quot;Fridays&quot; cast member Larry David and comedian Jerry Seinfeld. Although it got off to a slow start, by the mid-1990s it had become one of the most popular sitcoms in television history. It ended its nine-year run in 1998 at No. 1 in the Nielsen ratings. In &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, Kramer is the neighbor across the hall of the show&#x27;s eponymous character, and is usually referred to only by his last name. His first name, Cosmo, was revealed in the sixth-season episode &quot;The Switch&quot;.

Richards won more Emmys than any other &quot;Seinfeld&quot; cast member, taking home the award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1993, 1994, and 1997 for his role as Kramer. When referring to speculation that he would launch a spin-off to &quot;Seinfeld&quot; about Kramer, Richards said he was not interested in doing so. During the run of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, Richards made cameo appearances in several TV shows; he played himself in Episode2 of Season1 &quot;The Flirt Episode&quot; (1992) of the HBO series &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;. He also had a cameo role in the comedy thriller film &quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot;, credited as &quot;insensitive man&quot;. In 1996, Richards made a cameo in Epcot&#x27;s Ellen&#x27;s Energy Adventure, where he portrayed a caveman discovering fire. He played radio station employee Doug Beech in &quot;Airheads&quot;, and co-starred with Jeff Daniels as an actor pretending to be a lawyer in 1997&#x27;s &quot;Trial and Error&quot;. He also made guest appearances on &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, &quot;Night Court&quot; and &quot;Cheers&quot;.

In 2000, two years after the end of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, Richards began work on a new series for NBC, his first major project since &quot;Seinfeld&quot;″s finale. &quot;The Michael Richards Show&quot;, for which Richards received co-writer and co-executive producer credits, was conceived as a comedy/mystery starring Richards as a bumbling private investigator. When the first pilot failed with test audiences, NBC ordered that the show be retooled into a more conventional, office-based sitcom before its premiere. After a few weeks of poor ratings and negative reviews, it was canceled. Critics said the show was too &quot;Kramer-esque&quot; and Richards invoked the so-called &quot;&quot;Seinfeld&quot; curse&quot; as to why the show failed.

Starting in 2004, he and his fellow &quot;Seinfeld&quot; cast members provided interviews and audio commentaries for the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; DVDs. Richards stepped down from providing audio commentary after Season5, though he continued to provide interviews.

=== 2006–2012: Laugh Factory incident and aftermath===
During a performance on November 17, 2006 at the Laugh Factory in Hollywood, California, Richards launched into a racist rant in response to repeated heckling and interruptions from a small group of Black and Hispanic audience members. Richards was recorded shouting &quot;He&#x27;s a nigger!&quot; several times and making references to lynching, Planet of the Apes, and the Jim Crow laws. Kyle Doss, a member of the group that Richards addressed, said the group had arrived in the middle of the performance and were &quot;being a little loud.&quot; According to Doss:

The incident remained unknown to the larger public for three days until a cellphone video filmed by a member of the audience was obtained and released by TMZ. On November 20, after the video made rounds around the news, Jerry Seinfeld invited Richards to appear via satellite during a broadcast of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, where Richards was recorded saying: &quot;I&#x27;m not doing too good. I lost my temper on stage, I was at a comedy club trying to do my act and I got heckled and I took it badly and went into a rage. And uh, said some pretty, uh, nasty things to some Afro-Americans.&quot; Many studio audience members laughed as Richards began his unscripted explanation and apology, thinking it was a bit, leading Seinfeld to reprimand them, saying: &quot;Stop laughing. It&#x27;s not funny.&quot; Richards said he had been trying to defuse the heckling by being even more outrageous but it had backfired. He later called civil rights leaders Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to apologize. He also appeared as a guest on Jackson&#x27;s syndicated radio show. Doss stated that he did not accept Richards&#x27;s apology, saying: &quot;If he wanted to apologize, he could have contacted ... one of us out of the group. But he didn&#x27;t. He apologized on-camera just because the tape got out.&quot;

Richards popularity among the general public declined after the tape was released. A Gallup poll conducted in late November found that only 41 percent of Americans still held a favorable view of Richards. By contrast, other &quot;Seinfeld&quot; cast members&#x27; favorability ratings were in the 70s and 80s. The same poll also found that 45 percent of non-whites expressed a negative view of Richards due to the incident. The incident was parodied on several TV shows, including &quot;Mad TV&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Extras&quot; and &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;. In the ninth episode of the seventh season of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, Richards appeared as himself and poked fun at the incident. In 2008, rapper Wale referenced the incident and used recordings of the incident as well as Richard&#x27;s apology, in the song &quot;The Kramer&quot; on &quot;The Mixtape About Nothing&quot; album.

One year after the incident, Richards voiced character Bud Ditchwater in the animated film &quot;Bee Movie&quot;, which starred and was produced by Jerry Seinfeld. In 2009, Richards and the other main &quot;Seinfeld&quot; cast members appeared in the seventh season of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. In 2012, he appeared in the comedy web series &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot;, hosted by Seinfeld, in which he remarked on the 2006 incident. In the episode, Richards explained that the outburst still haunted him and was a major reason for his retirement from stand-up.

===2013–present: Recent years===
In 2013, Richards was cast to play Frank in the sitcom &quot;Kirstie&quot;, costarring Kirstie Alley and Rhea Perlman. It premiered on TV Land on December 4, 2013 and was canceled after one season. In 2014, Richards appeared as the president of Crackle in a trailer for Season5 of &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot;. Seinfeld said the trailer&#x27;s storyline would be expanded on in one of the episodes.

In 2019, Richards played Daddy Hogwood in the romantic comedy &quot;Faith, Hope &amp; Love&quot; starring Peta Murgatroyd and Robert Krantz.

In June 2024 Richards released a memoir entitled &quot;Entrances and Exits&quot;.

==Personal life==
Richards and his first wife, a family therapist, were married for 18 years. They have one daughter, born 1975. They separated in 1992 and divorced the following year. Through their daughter, Richards has two grandchildren.

In 2010, Richards married his girlfriend of eight years. They have one son, born 2011.

Richards is a Freemason.

Richards revealed in his 2024 memoir &quot;Entrances and Exits&quot; that he survived stage 1 prostate cancer in 2018 via a surgical removal of his entire prostate.

<text>Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport , also known as Santiago International Airport and Nuevo Pudahuel Airport, located in Pudahuel, north-west of central Santiago, is Chile&#x27;s largest aviation facility and busiest international airport.

The airport has domestic and international services to destinations in Europe, Oceania, Africa (cargo only), Asia and the Americas. In 2011, it was the ninth busiest airport in Latin America and the sixth busiest in South America by passenger traffic. It was the seventh busiest airport in Latin America by aircraft movements, serving 124,799 operations. Its location in Chile&#x27;s most populated area, as well as in the central part of the country, makes it an ideal main hub and maintenance center for most local airlines such as LATAM and Sky Airline. LATAM Airlines accounts for approximately 82% of the airport&#x27;s total commercial operations.

The airport is owned by the Chilean government and has been operated since October 2015 by &quot;Nuevo Pudahuel&quot;, a consortium of companies formed by Aéroports de Paris (France), Vinci Airports (France) and Astaldi (Italy). Air traffic control is handled by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. Its ICAO category is 4F. The airport functions as a joint civil-military facility. It is the headquarters of the Chilean Air Force 2nd Air Brigade and where its 10th Aviation Group is based.
Santiago International is the longest non-stop destination for most European carriers including Iberia, Air France, and British Airways from their respective hubs in Madrid–Barajas Airport, Paris–Charles de Gaulle, and London–Heathrow Airport. The airport is also Latin America&#x27;s main gateway to Oceania, with scheduled flights to Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland, and Easter Island.

== History ==

=== Early years ===

The demands of the growing metropolitan area of Santiago and the need for modern, jet-era airport facilities, which could safely accommodate both domestic and intercontinental flights, drove the need to relocate the Chilean capital&#x27;s principal airport from Los Cerrillos Airport (ICAO: SCTI; IATA: ULC) in the denser southwest metropolitan region of Santiago to the more rural northwest metropolitan area.

Construction of the original terminal building, the eastern runway (17L/35R), control tower, east apron and cargo facilities commenced in 1961. On February 2, 1967, the airport was commissioned Aeropuerto Internacional de Pudahuel, due to its location in the municipality of Pudahuel. On March 19, 1980, the airport was rechristened Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport in honour of the founder of the Chilean Air Force and Chilean carrier LATAM Chile (Formerly Linea Aerea Nacional, LAN Chile).

=== 1994 expansion ===
The facility was expanded in 1994 with a new international terminal that covered 90,000 square meters, inspired by the architecture of Marseille Provence Airport in France. The building is located between the two parallel runways.
This expansion added a new control tower, jetways, a duty-free zone, hotel, and greater parking area. The old terminal was used for domestic flights until 2001, when all passenger operations were merged into the same building.

In 2000, Lan Chile joined Oneworld, making of Arturo Merino Benitez Airport a main hub for the alliance, its first one in Latin America and its second in the Southern Hemisphere (after Qantas&#x27; Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport in Australia). As of April 2014, 71% of international and 75% of domestic passengers were carried by Oneworld member airlines.
During the 2010 Chile earthquake, the passenger terminal building suffered internal damages and the collapse of a pedestrian bridge between the vehicle ramp and the departures area. Nevertheless, both runways and control tower were unharmed, allowing the realization of a massive humanitarian air-bridge held by the Chilean Air Force to Concepción, Chile (Carriel Sur International Airport), close to the most damaged area by this earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The airport authority had closed off all commercial flight operations after around 1200 UTC on February 27, resuming full operations on March 3, 2010.

In 2011, IATA recognized the DGAC (Chile&#x27;s provider of air navigation services) and SCL (Santiago Airport) with the Exceptional Recognition Award to the cooperative efforts of SCL and DGAC Chile that facilitated a quick recovery from the devastation that followed the Chilean earthquake on 27 February 2010. &quot;Both airport and air navigation services were restored quickly with no impact on rates or charges for passengers or airlines. DGAC Chile and SCL are widely regarded as leaders in Latin America for efficiency, quality, and customer focus.

In June 2011, Santiago International Airport received the Air Cargo Excellence Award, as the best Latin American Cargo Airport.

=== Second runway ===
Construction on Runway 17R/35L began in 2004 and opened to traffic in September 2005. However, within months defects were discovered and the runway required repairing, completed in January 2006. Unfortunately further study of the problem discovered that the initial repairs were insufficient, needing additional work. Finally, 17R/35L reopened for traffic in March 2007.

=== 2020 master plan and expansion ===
In 2008, the airport terminal reached its maximum design capacity of 9.5 million annual passengers, two years earlier than forecast, and with the repairs needed after the 2010 Chile earthquake, the Ministry of Public Works announced in 2012 that it would call for proposals for the expansion and administration of the airport, two years prior to the end of the contract with the current operator.

The ministry decided to investigate a new airport master plan instead of an expansion of the single passenger terminal building, as initially proposed by the current operator. The feasibility studies for this master plan cost 4,560 million Chilean pesos (US$9.4 million) considered in the 2011 fiscal budget.

For this new master plan, the Government hired the consultancy services of &quot;Aéroports de Paris Ingeniérie&quot; (ADP-I), the architecture, engineering and technical branch of the French airport corporation.

The master plan took into account a capacity growth to 14 million annual passengers by 2014, thirty-four million by year 2034 and 50 million passengers by 2045. New detached passenger terminal buildings for international and domestic flights, additional commercial areas and the construction of a light railway connecting the airport with the Santiago Metro network were considered.

In June 2013, the Chilean Ministry of Public Works started Phase 1 of the airport expansion.

On February 4, 2015, the consortium &quot;Nuevo Pudahuel&quot;, formed by French companies Aéroports de Paris (45%), Vinci Airports (40%) and Italian infrastructure company Astaldi (15%) won the bidding process to manage and develop the airport for 20 years since October 1, 2015. The main missions of the new administration will be &quot;the renovation of existing installations with the redesign and extension of the current terminal (Terminal 1); the funding, design and construction of a new 175,000-square-meter terminal (Terminal 2) which will increase the airport&#x27;s capacity to 30 million passengers, with potential for expansion beyond 45 million; the operation and commercial development for the duration of the concession (20 years) of the main infrastructures: existing terminal and new terminals, car parks and future property developments. Building works will be executed by Astaldi (50% of conception-construction pool) and Vinci Construction Grands Projets (50%)&quot;. The new Terminal 2 was opened in 2022.

== Facilities ==
=== Terminal 1 – domestic flights ===

The terminal building, originally built for both domestic and international operations until 2021, has four levels:
*Ground floor: Arrivals, duty-free shop, baggage claim, transport services, parking areas, hotel access.
*First floor: Administrative offices, VIP lounges (access through the second floor).
*Second floor: Departures, check-in &amp; baggage drop off hall, shops, restaurants, boarding gates.
*Third floor: Restaurants and VIP check-in areas (LATAM).

Terminal 1 hosts a bank office, Chilean Automobile Club, telecommunication companies (Claro, Movistar and Entel PCS), pharmacy, travel agencies, airlines offices, insurance offices and a police station (Carabineros de Chile).

=== Terminal 2 – international flights ===

The new international terminal covers more than 200,000 square meters. It involved an investment of $900 million USD. Construction started in August 2016 and ended in March 2021, increasing the total airport capacity from 16 to 38 million passengers per year.
The core of the new terminal consists of a central processor (T2M) where passengers undertake arrivals and departures procedures as well as four piers where the departure lounges are located.

==== Terminal 2 piers ====

==== Pier C ====
Pier C is a structure that has 10 boarding bridges, on a surface of more than 23,700 square metres of serviceable area, and 27,600 square metres of constructed area. It opened its doors in December 2018. Its internal design and green colour are inspired by Easter Island (Rapa Nui).
The pier has more than 1,900 square metres dedicated to retail space, of which 250 square metres are allocated to Duty Free areas. The structure also has PRM assistance zones.

==== Pier D ====
Pier D features 10 loading bridges covering an area of over 22,000 square meters and opened its doors in July 2021. Passengers are able to reach Pier D directly from the &quot;Main Unit&quot; (T2M) and it is a place for both domestic and international flights. The building also features commercial and gastronomic premises, a playground, an area for art and culture and aid stations for passengers with reduced mobility. The space is inspired by the Atacama region, mirrored in its range of warm colors and panels inspired by the light, energy and strength of northern Chile.

==== Pier E ====
Pier E has 12 passenger boarding bridges on a surface of more than 26,700 square metres and opened during the second half of 2019. 
The pier has more than 1,600 square metres dedicated to retail space, of which 250 square metres are allocated to Duty Free areas. The structure will also have PRM assistance zones. It has been inspired by the region of Los Lagos (Lake District), and this is reflected in the structure&#x27;s blue palette and decorative panels.

<text>An ethnicity or ethnic group is a group of people who identify with each other on the basis of perceived shared attributes that distinguish them from other groups. Those attributes can include a people of a common language, culture, common sets of ancestry, traditions, society, religion, history, or social treatment. The term ethnicity is sometimes used interchangeably with the term nation, particularly in cases of ethnic nationalism.

Ethnicity may be construed as an inherited or societally imposed construct. Ethnic membership tends to be defined by a shared cultural heritage, ancestry, origin myth, history, homeland, language, dialect, religion, mythology, folklore, ritual, cuisine, dressing style, art, or physical appearance. Ethnic groups may share a narrow or broad spectrum of genetic ancestry, depending on group identification, with some groups having mixed genetic ancestry.

By way of assimilation, acculturation, amalgamation, language shift, intermarriage, adoption, and religious conversion, individuals or groups may over time shift from one ethnic group to another. Ethnic groups may be divided into subgroups or tribes, which over time may become separate ethnic groups themselves due to endogamy or physical isolation from the parent group. Conversely, formerly separate ethnicities can merge to form a panethnicity and may eventually merge into one single ethnicity. Whether through division or amalgamation, the formation of a separate ethnic identity is referred to as ethnogenesis.

Although both organic and performative criteria characterise ethnic groups, debate in the past has dichotomised between primordialism and constructivism. Earlier 20th-century &quot;Primordialists&quot; viewed ethnic groups as real phenomena whose distinct characteristics have endured since the distant past. Perspectives that developed after the 1960s increasingly viewed ethnic groups as &quot;social constructs&quot;, with identity assigned by societal rules.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;&quot; is ultimately derived from the Greek , through its adjectival form , loaned into Latin as . The inherited English language term for this concept is &quot;&quot;, used alongside the latinate &quot;&quot; since the late Middle English period.

In Early Modern English and until the mid-19th century, &quot;ethnic&quot; was used to mean or (in the sense of disparate &quot;nations&quot; which did not yet participate in the Christian ecumene), as the Septuagint used &#x27;the nations&#x27; to translate the Hebrew &quot;goyim&quot; &quot;the foreign nations, non-Hebrews, non-Jews&quot;. The Greek term in early antiquity (Homeric Greek) could refer to any large group, a &quot;host&quot; of men, a &quot;band&quot; of comrades as well as a &quot;swarm&quot; or &quot;flock&quot; of animals. In Classical Greek, the word took on a meaning comparable to the concept now expressed by &quot;ethnic group&quot;, mostly translated as &quot;nation, tribe, a unique people group&quot;; only in Hellenistic Greek did the term tend to become further narrowed to refer to &quot;foreign&quot; or &quot;barbarous&quot; nations in particular (whence the later meaning &quot;heathen, pagan&quot;).

In the 19th century, the term came to be used in the sense of &quot;peculiar to a tribe, race, people or nation&quot;, in a return to the original Greek meaning. The sense of &quot;different cultural groups&quot;, and in American English &quot;tribal, racial, cultural or national minority group&quot; arises in the 1930s to 1940s, serving as a replacement of the term race which had earlier taken this sense but was now becoming deprecated due to its association with ideological racism. The abstract &quot;ethnicity&quot; had been used as a stand-in for &quot;paganism&quot; in the 18th century, but now came to express the meaning of an &quot;ethnic character&quot; (first recorded 1953).

The term &quot;ethnic group&quot; was first recorded in 1935 and entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 1972. Depending on context, the term nationality may be used either synonymously with ethnicity or synonymously with citizenship (in a sovereign state). The process that results in emergence of an ethnicity is called ethnogenesis, a term in use in ethnological literature since about 1950. The term may also be used with the connotation of something unique and unusually exotic (cf. &quot;an ethnic restaurant&quot;, etc.), generally related to cultures of more recent immigrants, who arrived after the dominant population of an area was established.

Depending on which source of group identity is emphasized to define membership, the following types of (often mutually overlapping) groups can be identified:
* Ethno-linguistic, emphasizing shared language, dialect (and possibly script)example: French Canadians
* Ethno-national, emphasizing a shared polity or sense of national identityexample: Austrians
* Ethno-racial, emphasizing shared physical appearance based on phenotype example: African Americans
* Ethno-regional, emphasizing a distinct local sense of belonging stemming from relative geographic isolationexample: South Islanders of New Zealand
* Ethno-religious, emphasizing shared affiliation with a particular religion, denomination or sectexample: Mormons, Sikhs
* Ethno-cultural, emphasizing shared culture or tradition, often overlapping with other forms of ethnicityexample: Travellers

In many cases, more than one aspect determines membership: for instance, Armenian ethnicity can be defined by Armenian citizenship, having Armenian heritage, native use of the Armenian language, or membership of the Armenian Apostolic Church.

==Definitions and conceptual history==

Ethnography begins in classical antiquity; after early authors like Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus, Herodotus laid the foundation of both historiography and ethnography of the ancient world . The Greeks had developed a concept of their own ethnicity, which they grouped under the name of Hellenes. Although there were exceptions, such as Macedonia, which was ruled by nobility in a way that was not typically Greek, and Sparta, which had an unusual ruling class, the ancient Greeks generally enslaved only non-Greeks due to their strong belief in ethnonationalism. The Greeks sometimes believed that even their lowest citizens were superior to any barbarian. In his &quot;Politics&quot; 1.2–7; 3.14, Aristotle even described barbarians as natural slaves in contrast to the Greeks. Herodotus (8.144.2) gave a famous account of what defined Greek (Hellenic) ethnic identity in his day, enumerating
# shared descent (ὅμαιμον&quot;homaimon&quot;, &quot;of the same blood&quot;),
# shared language (ὁμόγλωσσον&quot;homoglōsson&quot;, &quot;speaking the same language&quot;),
# shared sanctuaries and sacrifices (Greek: θεῶν ἱδρύματά τε κοινὰ καὶ θυσίαι&quot;theōn hidrumata te koina kai thusiai&quot;),
# shared customs (Greek: ἤθεα ὁμότροπα&quot;ēthea homotropa&quot;, &quot;customs of like fashion&quot;).

Whether ethnicity qualifies as a cultural universal is to some extent dependent on the exact definition used. Many social scientists, such as anthropologists Fredrik Barth and Eric Wolf, do not consider ethnic identity to be universal. They regard ethnicity as a product of specific kinds of inter-group interactions, rather than an essential quality inherent to human groups.

According to Thomas Hylland Eriksen, the study of ethnicity was dominated by two distinct debates until recently.
* One is between &quot;primordialism&quot; and &quot;instrumentalism&quot;. In the primordialist view, the participant perceives ethnic ties collectively, as an externally given, even coercive, social bond. The instrumentalist approach, on the other hand, treats ethnicity primarily as an ad hoc element of a political strategy, used as a resource for interest groups for achieving secondary goals such as, for instance, an increase in wealth, power, or status. This debate is still an important point of reference in Political science, although most scholars&#x27; approaches fall between the two poles.
* The second debate is between &quot;constructivism&quot; and &quot;essentialism&quot;. Constructivists view national and ethnic identities as the product of historical forces, often recent, even when the identities are presented as old. Essentialists view such identities as ontological categories defining social actors.

According to Eriksen, these debates have been superseded, especially in anthropology, by scholars&#x27; attempts to respond to increasingly politicized forms of self-representation by members of different ethnic groups and nations. This is in the context of debates over multiculturalism in countries, such as the United States and Canada, which have large immigrant populations from many different cultures, and post-colonialism in the Caribbean and South Asia.

Max Weber maintained that ethnic groups were &quot;künstlich&quot; (artificial, i.e. a social construct) because they were based on a subjective belief in shared &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; (community). Secondly, this belief in shared Gemeinschaft did not create the group; the group created the belief. Third, group formation resulted from the drive to monopolize power and status. This was contrary to the prevailing naturalist belief of the time, which held that socio-cultural and behavioral differences between peoples stemmed from inherited traits and tendencies derived from common descent, then called &quot;race&quot;.

Another influential theoretician of ethnicity was Fredrik Barth, whose &quot;Ethnic Groups and Boundaries&quot; from 1969 has been described as instrumental in spreading the usage of the term in social studies in the 1980s and 1990s. Barth went further than Weber in stressing the constructed nature of ethnicity. To Barth, ethnicity was perpetually negotiated and renegotiated by both external ascription and internal self-identification. Barth&#x27;s view is that ethnic groups are not discontinuous cultural isolates or logical &quot;a priori&quot; to which people naturally belong. He wanted to part with anthropological notions of cultures as bounded entities, and ethnicity as primordialist bonds, replacing it with a focus on the interface between groups. &quot;Ethnic Groups and Boundaries&quot;, therefore, is a focus on the interconnectedness of ethnic identities. Barth writes: &quot;...categorical ethnic distinctions do not depend on an absence of mobility, contact, and information, but do entail social processes of exclusion and incorporation whereby discrete categories are maintained despite changing participation and membership in the course of individual life histories.&quot;

In 1978, anthropologist Ronald Cohen claimed that the identification of &quot;ethnic groups&quot; in the usage of social scientists often reflected inaccurate labels more than indigenous realities:
In this way, he pointed to the fact that identification of an ethnic group by outsiders, e.g. anthropologists, may not coincide with the self-identification of the members of that group. He also described that in the first decades of usage, the term ethnicity had often been used in lieu of older terms such as &quot;cultural&quot; or &quot;tribal&quot; when referring to smaller groups with shared cultural systems and shared heritage, but that &quot;ethnicity&quot; had the added value of being able to describe the commonalities between systems of group identity in both tribal and modern societies. Cohen also suggested that claims concerning &quot;ethnic&quot; identity (like earlier claims concerning &quot;tribal&quot; identity) are often colonialist practices and effects of the relations between colonized peoples and nation-states.

According to Paul James, formations of identity were often changed and distorted by colonization, but identities are not made out of nothing:
Social scientists have thus focused on how, when, and why different markers of ethnic identity become salient. Thus, anthropologist Joan Vincent observed that ethnic boundaries often have a mercurial character. Ronald Cohen concluded that ethnicity is &quot;a series of nesting dichotomizations of inclusiveness and exclusiveness&quot;. He agrees with Joan Vincent&#x27;s observation that (in Cohen&#x27;s paraphrase) &quot;Ethnicity... can be narrowed or broadened in boundary terms in relation to the specific needs of political mobilization.&quot; This may be why descent is sometimes a marker of ethnicity, and sometimes not: which diacritic of ethnicity is salient depends on whether people are scaling ethnic boundaries up or down, and whether they are scaling them up or down depends generally on the political situation.

Kanchan Chandra rejects the expansive definitions of ethnic identity (such as those that include common culture, common language, common history and common territory), choosing instead to define ethnic identity narrowly as a subset of identity categories determined by the belief of common descent. Jóhanna Birnir similarly defines ethnicity as &quot;group self-identification around a characteristic that is very difficult or even impossible to change, such as language, race, or location.&quot;

===Approaches to understanding ethnicity===
Different approaches to understanding ethnicity have been used by different social scientists when trying to understand the nature of ethnicity as a factor in human life and society. As Jonathan M. Hall observes, World War II was a turning point in ethnic studies. The consequences of Nazi racism discouraged essentialist interpretations of ethnic groups and race. Ethnic groups came to be defined as social rather than biological entities. Their coherence was attributed to shared myths, descent, kinship, a common place of origin, language, religion, customs, and national character. So, ethnic groups are conceived as mutable rather than stable, constructed in discursive practices rather than written in the genes.

Examples of various approaches are primordialism, essentialism, perennialism, constructivism, modernism, and instrumentalism.
* &quot;&quot;Primordialism&quot;, holds that ethnicity has existed at all times of human history and that modern ethnic groups have historical continuity into the far past. For them, the idea of ethnicity is closely linked to the idea of nations and is rooted in the pre-Weber understanding of humanity as being divided into primordially existing groups rooted by kinship and biological heritage.
** &quot;Essentialist primordialism&quot;&quot; further holds that ethnicity is an &quot;a priori&quot; fact of human existence, that ethnicity precedes any human social interaction and that it is unchanged by it. This theory sees ethnic groups as natural, not just as historical. It also has problems dealing with the consequences of intermarriage, migration and colonization for the composition of modern-day multi-ethnic societies.
** &quot;Kinship primordialism&quot; holds that ethnic communities are extensions of kinship units, basically being derived by kinship or clan ties where the choices of cultural signs (language, religion, traditions) are made exactly to show this biological affinity. In this way, the myths of common biological ancestry that are a defining feature of ethnic communities are to be understood as representing actual biological history. A problem with this view on ethnicity is that it is more often than not the case that mythic origins of specific ethnic groups directly contradict the known biological history of an ethnic community.
** &quot;Geertz&#x27;s primordialism&quot;, notably espoused by anthropologist Clifford Geertz, argues that humans in general attribute an overwhelming power to primordial human &quot;givens&quot; such as blood ties, language, territory, and cultural differences. In Geertz&#x27; opinion, ethnicity is not in itself primordial but humans perceive it as such because it is embedded in their experience of the world.
* &quot;Perennialism&quot; is an approach that is primarily concerned with nationhood but tends to see nations and ethnic communities as basically the same phenomenon. It holds that the nation, as a type of social and political organization, is of an immemorial or &quot;perennial&quot; character. Smith (1999) distinguishes two variants: &quot;continuous perennialism&quot;, which claims that particular nations have existed for very long periods, and &quot;recurrent perennialism&quot;, which focuses on the emergence, dissolution and reappearance of nations as a recurring aspect of human history.
** &quot;&quot;Perpetual perennialism&quot; holds that specific ethnic groups have existed continuously throughout history.
** &quot;Situational perennialism&quot; holds that nations and ethnic groups emerge, change and vanish through the course of history. This view holds that the concept of ethnicity is a tool used by political groups to manipulate resources such as wealth, power, territory or status in their particular groups&#x27; interests. Accordingly, ethnicity emerges when it is relevant as a means of furthering emergent collective interests and changes according to political changes in society. Examples of a perennialist interpretation of ethnicity are also found in Barth and Seidner who see ethnicity as ever-changing boundaries between groups of people established through ongoing social negotiation and interaction.
** &quot;Instrumentalist perennialism&quot;&quot;, while seeing ethnicity primarily as a versatile tool that identified different ethnics groups and limits through time, explains ethnicity as a mechanism of social stratification, meaning that ethnicity is the basis for a hierarchical arrangement of individuals. According to Donald Noel, a sociologist who developed a theory on the origin of ethnic stratification, ethnic stratification is a &quot;system of stratification wherein some relatively fixed group membership (e.g., race, religion, or nationality) is used as a major criterion for assigning social positions&quot;. Ethnic stratification is one of many different types of social stratification, including stratification based on socio-economic status, race, or gender. According to Donald Noel, ethnic stratification will emerge only when specific ethnic groups are brought into contact with one another, and only when those groups are characterized by a high degree of ethnocentrism, competition, and differential power. Ethnocentrism is the tendency to look at the world primarily from the perspective of one&#x27;s own culture, and to downgrade all other groups outside one&#x27;s own culture. Some sociologists, such as Lawrence Bobo and Vincent Hutchings, say the origin of ethnic stratification lies in individual dispositions of ethnic prejudice, which relates to the theory of ethnocentrism. Continuing with Noel&#x27;s theory, some degree of differential power must be present for the emergence of ethnic stratification. In other words, an inequality of power among ethnic groups means &quot;they are of such unequal power that one is able to impose its will upon another&quot;. In addition to differential power, a degree of competition structured along ethnic lines is a prerequisite to ethnic stratification as well. The different ethnic groups must be competing for some common goal, such as power or influence, or a material interest, such as wealth or territory. Lawrence Bobo and Vincent Hutchings propose that competition is driven by self-interest and hostility, and results in inevitable stratification and conflict.
* &quot;&quot;Constructivism&quot; sees both primordialist and perennialist views as basically flawed, and rejects the notion of ethnicity as a basic human condition. It holds that ethnic groups are only products of human social interaction, maintained only in so far as they are maintained as valid social constructs in societies.
** &quot;Modernist constructivism&quot;&quot; correlates the emergence of ethnicity with the movement towards nation states beginning in the early modern period. Proponents of this theory, such as Eric Hobsbawm, argue that ethnicity and notions of ethnic pride, such as nationalism, are purely modern inventions, appearing only in the modern period of world history. They hold that prior to this ethnic homogeneity was not considered an ideal or necessary factor in the forging of large-scale societies.

Ethnicity is an important means by which people may identify with a larger group. Many social scientists, such as anthropologists Fredrik Barth and Eric Wolf, do not consider ethnic identity to be universal. They regard ethnicity as a product of specific kinds of inter-group interactions, rather than an essential quality inherent to human groups. The process that results in emergence of such identification is called ethnogenesis. Members of an ethnic group, on the whole, claim cultural continuities over time, although historians and cultural anthropologists have documented that many of the values, practices, and norms that imply continuity with the past are of relatively recent invention.

Ethnic groups can form a cultural mosaic in a society. That could be in a city like New York City or Trieste, but also the fallen monarchy of the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the United States. Current topics are in particular social and cultural differentiation, multilingualism, competing identity offers, multiple cultural identities and the formation of Salad bowl and melting pot. Ethnic groups differ from other social groups, such as subcultures, interest groups or social classes, because they emerge and change over historical periods (centuries) in a process known as ethnogenesis, a period of several generations of endogamy resulting in common ancestry (which is then sometimes cast in terms of a mythological narrative of a founding figure); ethnic identity is reinforced by reference to &quot;boundary markers&quot;characteristics said to be unique to the group which set it apart from other groups.

===Ethnicity theory in the United States===
&quot;Ethnicity theory&quot; argues that race is a social category and is only one of several factors in determining ethnicity. Other criteria include &quot;religion, language, &#x27;customs&#x27;, nationality, and political identification&quot;. This theory was put forward by sociologist Robert E. Park in the 1920s. It is based on the notion of &quot;culture&quot;.

This theory was preceded by more than 100 years during which biological essentialism was the dominant paradigm on race. Biological essentialism is the belief that some races, specifically White Europeans in western versions of the paradigm, are biologically superior and other races, specifically non-White races in western debates, are inherently inferior. This view arose as a way to justify enslavement of African Americans and genocide of Native Americans in a society that was officially founded on freedom for all. This was a notion that developed slowly and came to be a preoccupation with scientists, theologians, and the public. Religious institutions asked questions about whether there had been multiple creations of races (polygenesis) and whether God had created lesser races. Many of the foremost scientists of the time took up the idea of racial difference and found that White Europeans were superior.

The ethnicity theory was based on the assimilation model. Park outlined four steps to assimilation: contact, conflict, accommodation, and assimilation. Instead of attributing the marginalized status of people of color in the United States to their inherent biological inferiority, he attributed it to their failure to assimilate into American culture. They could become equal if they abandoned their inferior cultures.

Michael Omi and Howard Winant&#x27;s theory of racial formation directly confronts both the premises and the practices of ethnicity theory. They argue in &quot;Racial Formation in the United States&quot; that the ethnicity theory was exclusively based on the immigration patterns of the White population and did take into account the unique experiences of non-Whites in the United States. While Park&#x27;s theory identified different stages in the immigration processcontact, conflict, struggle, and as the last and best response, assimilationit did so only for White communities. The ethnicity paradigm neglected the ways in which race can complicate a community&#x27;s interactions with social and political structures, especially upon contact.

Assimilationshedding the particular qualities of a native culture for the purpose of blending in with a host culturedid not work for some groups as a response to racism and discrimination, though it did for others. Once the legal barriers to achieving equality had been dismantled, the problem of racism became the sole responsibility of already disadvantaged communities. It was assumed that if a Black or Latino community was not &quot;making it&quot; by the standards that had been set by Whites, it was because that community did not hold the right values or beliefs, or were stubbornly resisting dominant norms because they did not want to fit in. Omi and Winant&#x27;s critique of ethnicity theory explains how looking to cultural defect as the source of inequality ignores the &quot;concrete sociopolitical dynamics within which racial phenomena operate in the U.S.&quot; It prevents critical examination of the structural components of racism and encourages a &quot;benign neglect&quot; of social inequality.

==Ethnicity and nationality==

In some cases, especially those involving transnational migration or colonial expansion, ethnicity is linked to nationality. Anthropologists and historians, following the modernist understanding of ethnicity as proposed by Ernest Gellner and Benedict Anderson see nations and nationalism as developing with the rise of the modern state system in the 17th century. They culminated in the rise of &quot;nation-states&quot; in which the presumptive boundaries of the nation coincided (or ideally coincided) with state boundaries.
Thus, in the West, the notion of ethnicity, like race and nation, developed in the context of European colonial expansion, when mercantilism and capitalism were promoting global movements of populations at the same time that state boundaries were being more clearly and rigidly defined.

In the 19th century, modern states generally sought legitimacy through their claim to represent &quot;nations&quot;. Nation-states, however, invariably include populations who have been excluded from national life for one reason or another. Members of excluded groups, consequently, will either demand inclusion based on equality or seek autonomy, sometimes even to the extent of complete political separation in their nation-state. Under these conditionswhen people moved from one state to another, or one state conquered or colonized peoples beyond its national boundariesethnic groups were formed by people who identified with one nation but lived in another state.

Multi-ethnic states can be the result of two opposite events, either the recent creation of state borders at variance with traditional tribal territories, or the recent immigration of ethnic minorities into a former nation-state.
Examples for the first case are found throughout Africa, where countries created during decolonization inherited arbitrary colonial borders, but also in European countries such as Belgium or United Kingdom. Examples for the second case are countries such as Netherlands, which were relatively ethnically homogeneous when they attained statehood but have received significant immigration in the 17th century and even more so in the second half of the 20th century. States such as the United Kingdom, France and Switzerland comprised distinct ethnic groups from their formation and have likewise experienced substantial immigration, resulting in what has been termed &quot;multicultural&quot; societies, especially in large cities.

The states of the New World were multi-ethnic from the onset, as they were formed as colonies imposed on existing indigenous populations.

In recent decades, feminist scholars (most notably Nira Yuval-Davis) have drawn attention to the fundamental ways in which women participate in the creation and reproduction of ethnic and national categories. Though these categories are usually discussed as belonging to the public, political sphere, they are upheld within the private, family sphere to a great extent. It is here that women act not just as biological reproducers but also as &quot;cultural carriers&quot;, transmitting knowledge and enforcing behaviors that belong to a specific collectivity. Women also often play a significant symbolic role in conceptions of nation or ethnicity, for example in the notion that &quot;women and children&quot; constitute the kernel of a nation which must be defended in times of conflict, or in iconic figures such as Britannia or Marianne.

==Ethnicity and race==
Ethnicity is used as a matter of cultural identity of a group, often based on shared ancestry, language, and cultural traditions, while race is applied as a taxonomic grouping, based on physical similarities among groups. Race is a more controversial subject than ethnicity, due to common political use of the term. Ramón Grosfoguel (University of California, Berkeley) argues that &quot;racial/ethnic identity&quot; is one concept and concepts of race and ethnicity cannot be used as separate and autonomous categories.

Before Weber (1864–1920), race and ethnicity were primarily seen as two aspects of the same thing. Around 1900 and before, the primordialist understanding of ethnicity predominated: cultural differences between peoples were seen as being the result of inherited traits and tendencies. With Weber&#x27;s introduction of the idea of ethnicity as a social construct, race and ethnicity became more divided from each other.

In 1950, the UNESCO statement &quot;The Race Question&quot;, signed by some of the internationally renowned scholars of the time (including Ashley Montagu, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Gunnar Myrdal, Julian Huxley, etc.), said:
In 1982, anthropologist David Craig Griffith summed up forty years of ethnographic research, arguing that racial and ethnic categories are symbolic markers for different ways people from different parts of the world have been incorporated into a global economy:
According to Wolf, racial categories were constructed and incorporated during the period of European mercantile expansion, and ethnic groupings during the period of capitalist expansion.

Writing in 1977 about the usage of the term &quot;ethnic&quot; in the ordinary language of Great Britain and the United States, Wallman noted
In the U.S., the OMB says the definition of race as used for the purposes of the US Census is not &quot;scientific or anthropological&quot; and takes into account &quot;social and cultural characteristics as well as ancestry&quot;, using &quot;appropriate scientific methodologies&quot; that are not &quot;primarily biological or genetic in reference&quot;.

==Ethno-national conflict==
Sometimes ethnic groups are subject to prejudicial attitudes and actions by the state or its constituents. In the 20th century, people began to argue that conflicts among ethnic groups or between members of an ethnic group and the state can and should be resolved in one of two ways. Some, like Jürgen Habermas and Bruce Barry, have argued that the legitimacy of modern states must be based on a notion of political rights of autonomous individual subjects. According to this view, the state should not acknowledge ethnic, national or racial identity but rather instead enforce political and legal equality of all individuals. Others, like Charles Taylor and Will Kymlicka, argue that the notion of the autonomous individual is itself a cultural construct. According to this view, states must recognize ethnic identity and develop processes through which the particular needs of ethnic groups can be accommodated within the boundaries of the nation-state.

The 19th century saw the development of the political ideology of ethnic nationalism, when the concept of race was tied to nationalism, first by German theorists including Johann Gottfried von Herder. Instances of societies focusing on ethnic ties, arguably to the exclusion of history or historical context, have resulted in the justification of nationalist goals. Two periods frequently cited as examples of this are the 19th-century consolidation and expansion of the German Empire and the 20th century Nazi Germany. Each promoted the pan-ethnic idea that these governments were acquiring only lands that had always been inhabited by ethnic Germans. The history of late-comers to the nation-state model, such as those arising in the Near East and south-eastern Europe out of the dissolution of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires, as well as those arising out of the USSR, is marked by inter-ethnic conflicts. Such conflicts usually occur within multi-ethnic states, as opposed to between them, as in other regions of the world. Thus, the conflicts are often misleadingly labeled and characterized as civil wars when they are inter-ethnic conflicts in a multi-ethnic state.

==Ethnic groups by continent==
===Africa===

Ethnic groups in Africa number in the hundreds, each generally having its own language (or dialect of a language) and culture.

===Asia===

Ethnic groups are abundant throughout Asia, with adaptations to the climate zones of Asia, which can be the Arctic, subarctic, temperate, subtropical or tropical. The ethnic groups have adapted to mountains, deserts, grasslands, and forests.

On the coasts of Asia, the ethnic groups have adopted various methods of harvest and transport. Some groups are primarily hunter-gatherers, some practice transhumance (nomadic lifestyle), others have been agrarian/rural for millennia and others becoming industrial/urban. Some groups/countries of Asia are completely urban, such as those in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Singapore. The colonization of Asia was largely ended in the 20th century, with national drives for independence and self-determination across the continent.

In Indonesia alone, there are more than 600 ethnic groups, which are located on 17,000 islands in the Indonesian archipelago.

Russia has more than 185 recognized ethnic groups besides the eighty percent ethnic Russian majority. The largest group is the Tatars, 3.8 percent. Many of the smaller groups are found in the Asian part of Russia (see Indigenous peoples of Siberia).

===Europe===


Europe has a large number of ethnic groups; Pan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct &quot;peoples of Europe&quot;, of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities within every state they inhabit (although they may form local regional majorities within a sub-national entity). The total number of national minority populations in Europe is estimated at 105 million people or 14% of 770 million Europeans.

A number of European countries, including France and Switzerland, do not collect information on the ethnicity of their resident population.

An example of a largely nomadic ethnic group in Europe is the Roma, pejoratively known as Gypsies. They originated from India and speak the Romani language.

The Serbian province of Vojvodina is recognizable for its multi-ethnic and multi-cultural identity. There are some 26 ethnic groups in the province, and six languages are in official use by the provincial administration.
===North America===
The indigenous people in North America are Native Americans. During European colonization, Europeans arrived in North America. Most Native Americans died due to Spanish diseases and other European diseases such as smallpox during the European colonization of the Americas. The largest pan-ethnic group in the United States is White Americans. Hispanic and Latino Americans (Mexican Americans in particular) and Asian Americans have immigrated to the United States recently. In Mexico, most Mexicans are mestizo, a mixture of Spanish and Native American ancestry. Some Hispanic and Latino Americans living in the United States are not mestizos.

Enslaved Africans were brought to North America from the 16th to 19th centuries during the Atlantic slave trade. Many of them were sent to the Caribbean. Ethnic groups that live in the Caribbean are: indigenous peoples, Africans, Indians, White Europeans, Chinese and Portuguese. The first White Europeans to arrive in the Dominican Republic were the Spanish in 1492. The Caribbean was also colonized and discovered by the Portuguese, English, Dutch and French.

A sizeable number of people in the United States have mixed-race identities. In 2021, the number of Americans who identified as non-Hispanic and more than one race was 13.5 million. The number of Hispanic Americans who identified as multiracial was 20.3 million. Over the course of the 2010s decade, there was a 127% increase in non-Hispanic Americans who identified as multiracial.

The largest ethnic groups in the United States are Germans, African Americans, Mexicans, Irish, English,
Americans, Italians, Poles, French, Scottish, Native Americans, Puerto Ricans, Norwegians, Dutch people, Swedish people, Chinese people, West Indians, Russians and Filipinos.

In Canada, European Canadians are the largest ethnic group. In Canada, the indigenous population is growing faster than the non-indigenous population. Most immigrants in Canada come from Asia.

=== South America ===

In South America, although highly varying between regions, people are commonly mixed-race, indigenous, European, black African, and to a lesser extent also Asian.

===Oceania===

Nearly all states in Oceania have majority indigenous populations, with notable exceptions being Australia, New Zealand and Norfolk Island, who have majority European populations. States with smaller European populations include Guam, Hawaii and New Caledonia (whose Europeans are known as Caldoche). Indigenous peoples of Oceania are Australian Aboriginals, Austronesians and Papuans, and they originated from Asia. The Austronesians of Oceania are further broken up into three distinct groups; Melanesians, Micronesians and Polynesians.

Oceanic South Pacific islands nearing Latin America were uninhabited when discovered by Europeans in the 16th century, with nothing to indicate prehistoric human activity by Indigenous peoples of the Americas or Oceania. Contemporary residents are mainly mestizos and Europeans from the Latin American countries whom administer them, although none of these islands have extensive populations. Easter Island are the only oceanic island politically associated with Latin America to have an indigenous population, the Polynesian Rapa Nui people. Their current inhabitants include indigenous Polynesians and mestizo settlers from political administrators Chile, in addition to mixed-race individuals with Polynesian and mestizo/European ancestry. The British overseas territory of Pitcairn Islands, to the west of Easter Island, have a population of approximately 50 people. They are mixed-race Euronesians who descended from an initial group of British and Tahitian settlers in the 18th century. The islands were previously inhabited by Polynesians; they had long abandoned Pitcairn by the time the settlers had arrived. Norfolk Island, now an external territory of Australia, is also believed to have been inhabited by Polynesians prior to its initial European discovery in the 18th century. Some of their residents are descended from mixed-race Pitcairn Islanders that were relocated onto Norfolk due to overpopulation in 1856.

The once uninhabited Bonin Islands, later politically integrated into Japan, have a small population consisting of Japanese mainlanders and descendants of early European settlers. Archeological findings from the 1990s suggested there was possible prehistoric human activity by Micronesians prior to European discovery in the 16th century.

Several political entities associated with Oceania are still uninhabited, including Baker Island, Clipperton Island, Howland Island and Jarvis Island. There were brief attempts to settle Clipperton with Mexicans and Jarvis with Native Hawaiians in the early 20th century. The Jarvis settlers were relocated from the island due to Japanese advancements during World War II, while most of the settlers on Clipperton ended up dying from starvation and murdering one and other.

====Australia====
The first evident ethnic group to live in Australia were the Australian Aboriginals, a group considered related to the Melanesian Torres Strait Islander people. Europeans, primarily from England, arrived first in 1770.

The 2016 Census shows England and New Zealand are the next most common countries of birth after Australia. The proportion of people born in China and India has increased since 2011 (from 6.0 per cent to 8.3 per cent, and 5.6 per cent to 7.4 per cent, respectively).

The proportion of people identifying as being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin increased from 2.5 per cent of the Australian population in 2011 to 2.8 per cent in 2016.

&quot;Undressed&quot; was filmed in Los Angeles for the first five seasons, and in Montreal, Quebec, Canada for the sixth and final season.

==Syndication==
In January 2010, episodes briefly ran on Logo.

==Future==
In November 2018, it was reported that a reboot of the series was in the works at MTV Studios with original series creator Roland Joffé as executive producer. Said Pamela Post (Head of Scripted Programming for MTV Studios, MTV, VH1 and Logo): &quot;Undressed was ahead of its time and we&#x27;re looking forward to developing the series for a whole new generation. Much has changed in the dating/relationship world since the series first premiered and we&#x27;re excited to showcase how both have evolved.&quot;

<doc id="105012" wikidata="Q759832" url="?curid=105012" title="Solvable group">
<text>In mathematics, more specifically in the field of group theory, a solvable group or soluble group is a group that can be constructed from abelian groups using extensions. Equivalently, a solvable group is a group whose derived series terminates in the trivial subgroup.

== Motivation ==
Historically, the word &quot;solvable&quot; arose from Galois theory and the proof of the general unsolvability of quintic equations. Specifically, a polynomial equation is solvable in radicals if and only if the corresponding Galois group is solvable (note this theorem holds only in characteristic 0). This means associated to a polynomial formula_1 there is a tower of field extensionsformula_2such that

# formula_3 where formula_4, so formula_5 is a solution to the equation formula_6 where formula_7
# formula_8 contains a splitting field for formula_9

=== Example ===
The smallest Galois field extension of formula_10 containing the elementformula_11gives a solvable group. The associated field extensionsformula_12give a solvable group of Galois extensions containing the following composition factors (where formula_13 is the identity permutation).

* formula_14 with group action formula_15, and minimal polynomial formula_16
* formula_17 with group action formula_18, and minimal polynomial formula_19
* formula_20 with group action formula_21, and minimal polynomial formula_22 containing the 5th roots of unity excluding formula_13
* formula_24 with group action formula_25, and minimal polynomial formula_26

Each of the defining group actions (for example, formula_27) changes a single extension while keeping all of the other extensions fixed. The 80 group actions are the set formula_28.

This group is not abelian. For example, formula_29, whilst formula_30, and in fact, formula_31. 

It is isomorphic to formula_32, where formula_33, defined using the semidirect product and direct product of the cyclic groups. formula_34 is not a normal subgroup.

==Definition==
A group &quot;G&quot; is called solvable if it has a subnormal series whose factor groups (quotient groups) are all abelian, that is, if there are subgroups
:formula_35
meaning that &quot;G&quot;&quot;j&quot;−1 is normal in &quot;Gj&quot;, such that &quot;Gj &quot;/&quot;G&quot;&quot;j&quot;−1 is an abelian group, for &quot;j&quot; = 1, 2, ..., &quot;k&quot;.

Or equivalently, if its derived series, the descending normal series
:formula_36
where every subgroup is the commutator subgroup of the previous one, eventually reaches the trivial subgroup of &quot;G&quot;. These two definitions are equivalent, since for every group &quot;H&quot; and every normal subgroup &quot;N&quot; of &quot;H&quot;, the quotient &quot;H&quot;/&quot;N&quot; is abelian if and only if &quot;N&quot; includes the commutator subgroup of &quot;H&quot;. The least &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;G&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 1 is called the derived length of the solvable group &quot;G&quot;.

For finite groups, an equivalent definition is that a solvable group is a group with a composition series all of whose factors are cyclic groups of prime order. This is equivalent because a finite group has finite composition length, and every simple abelian group is cyclic of prime order. The Jordan–Hölder theorem guarantees that if one composition series has this property, then all composition series will have this property as well. For the Galois group of a polynomial, these cyclic groups correspond to &quot;n&quot;th roots (radicals) over some field. The equivalence does not necessarily hold for infinite groups: for example, since every nontrivial subgroup of the group Z of integers under addition is isomorphic to Z itself, it has no composition series, but the normal series {0, Z}, with its only factor group isomorphic to Z, proves that it is in fact solvable.

== Examples ==

=== Abelian groups ===
The basic example of solvable groups are abelian groups. They are trivially solvable since a subnormal series is formed by just the group itself and the trivial group. But non-abelian groups may or may not be solvable.

=== Nilpotent groups ===
More generally, all nilpotent groups are solvable. In particular, finite &quot;p&quot;-groups are solvable, as all finite &quot;p&quot;-groups are nilpotent.

==== Quaternion groups ====
In particular, the quaternion group is a solvable group given by the group extensionformula_37where the kernel formula_38 is the subgroup generated by formula_39.

=== Group extensions ===
Group extensions form the prototypical examples of solvable groups. That is, if formula_40 and formula_41 are solvable groups, then any extensionformula_42defines a solvable group formula_43. In fact, all solvable groups can be formed from such group extensions.

=== Non-abelian group which is non-nilpotent ===
A small example of a solvable, non-nilpotent group is the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;3. In fact, as the smallest simple non-abelian group is &quot;A&quot;5, (the alternating group of degree 5) it follows that &quot;every&quot; group with order less than 60 is solvable.

=== Finite groups of odd order ===
The Feit–Thompson theorem states that every finite group of odd order is solvable. In particular this implies that if a finite group is simple, it is either a prime cyclic or of even order.

=== Non-example ===
The group &quot;S&quot;5 is not solvable — it has a composition series {E, &quot;A&quot;5, &quot;S&quot;5} (and the Jordan–Hölder theorem states that every other composition series is equivalent to that one), giving factor groups isomorphic to &quot;A&quot;5 and &quot;C&quot;2; and &quot;A&quot;5 is not abelian. Generalizing this argument, coupled with the fact that &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; is a normal, maximal, non-abelian simple subgroup of &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 4, we see that &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; is not solvable for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 4. This is a key step in the proof that for every &quot;n&quot; &gt; 4 there are polynomials of degree &quot;n&quot; which are not solvable by radicals (Abel–Ruffini theorem). This property is also used in complexity theory in the proof of Barrington&#x27;s theorem.

=== Subgroups of GL2 ===
Consider the subgroupsformula_44 of formula_45for some field formula_46. Then, the group quotient formula_47 can be found by taking arbitrary elements in formula_48, multiplying them together, and figuring out what structure this gives. Soformula_49Note the determinant condition on formula_50 implies formula_51, hence formula_52 is a subgroup (which are the matrices where formula_53). For fixed formula_54, the linear equation formula_55 implies formula_56, which is an arbitrary element in formula_57 since formula_58. Since we can take any matrix in formula_59 and multiply it by the matrixformula_60with formula_56, we can get a diagonal matrix in formula_59. This shows the quotient group formula_63.

==== Remark ====
Notice that this description gives the decomposition of formula_59 as formula_65 where formula_66 acts on formula_67 by formula_68. This implies formula_69. Also, a matrix of the formformula_70corresponds to the element formula_71 in the group.

=== Borel subgroups ===
For a linear algebraic group formula_40, a Borel subgroup is defined as a subgroup which is closed, connected, and solvable in formula_40, and is a maximal possible subgroup with these properties (note the first two are topological properties). For example, in formula_74 and formula_75 the groups of upper-triangular, or lower-triangular matrices are two of the Borel subgroups. The example given above, the subgroup formula_76 in formula_77, is a Borel subgroup.

==== Borel subgroup in GL3 ====
In formula_78 there are the subgroupsformula_79Notice formula_80, hence the Borel group has the formformula_81

==== Borel subgroup in product of simple linear algebraic groups ====
In the product group formula_82 the Borel subgroup can be represented by matrices of the formformula_83where formula_84 is an formula_85 upper triangular matrix and formula_86 is a formula_87 upper triangular matrix.

=== Z-groups ===
Any finite group whose &quot;p&quot;-Sylow subgroups are cyclic is a semidirect product of two cyclic groups, in particular solvable. Such groups are called Z-groups.

== OEIS values ==
Numbers of solvable groups with order &quot;n&quot; are (start with &quot;n&quot; = 0)

Solvability is closed under a number of operations.

* If &quot;G&quot; is solvable, and &quot;H&quot; is a subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, then &quot;H&quot; is solvable.
* If &quot;G&quot; is solvable, and there is a homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; onto &quot;H&quot;, then &quot;H&quot; is solvable; equivalently (by the first isomorphism theorem), if &quot;G&quot; is solvable, and &quot;N&quot; is a normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, then &quot;G&quot;/&quot;N&quot; is solvable.
* The previous properties can be expanded into the following &quot;three for the price of two&quot; property: &quot;G&quot; is solvable if and only if both &quot;N&quot; and &quot;G&quot;/&quot;N&quot; are solvable.
* In particular, if &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are solvable, the direct product &quot;G&quot; × &quot;H&quot; is solvable.

Solvability is closed under group extension:
* If &quot;H&quot; and &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; are solvable, then so is &quot;G&quot;; in particular, if &quot;N&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are solvable, their semidirect product is also solvable.

It is also closed under wreath product:
* If &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are solvable, and &quot;X&quot; is a &quot;G&quot;-set, then the wreath product of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; with respect to &quot;X&quot; is also solvable.

For any positive integer &quot;N&quot;, the solvable groups of derived length at most &quot;N&quot; form a subvariety of the variety of groups, as they are closed under the taking of homomorphic images, subalgebras, and (direct) products. The direct product of a sequence of solvable groups with unbounded derived length is not solvable, so the class of all solvable groups is not a variety.

==Burnside&#x27;s theorem==

Burnside&#x27;s theorem states that if &quot;G&quot; is a finite group of order &quot;paqb&quot; where &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are prime numbers, and &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are non-negative integers, then &quot;G&quot; is solvable.

===Supersolvable groups===

As a strengthening of solvability, a group &quot;G&quot; is called supersolvable (or supersoluble) if it has an &quot;invariant&quot; normal series whose factors are all cyclic. Since a normal series has finite length by definition, uncountable groups are not supersolvable. In fact, all supersolvable groups are finitely generated, and an abelian group is supersolvable if and only if it is finitely generated. The alternating group &quot;A&quot;4 is an example of a finite solvable group that is not supersolvable.

If we restrict ourselves to finitely generated groups, we can consider the following arrangement of classes of groups:

:cyclic &lt; abelian &lt; nilpotent &lt; supersolvable &lt; polycyclic &lt; solvable &lt; finitely generated group.

===Virtually solvable groups===
A group &quot;G&quot; is called virtually solvable if it has a solvable subgroup of finite index. This is similar to virtually abelian. Clearly all solvable groups are virtually solvable, since one can just choose the group itself, which has index 1.

===Hypoabelian===
A solvable group is one whose derived series reaches the trivial subgroup at a &quot;finite&quot; stage. For an infinite group, the finite derived series may not stabilize, but the transfinite derived series always stabilizes. A group whose transfinite derived series reaches the trivial group is called a hypoabelian group, and every solvable group is a hypoabelian group. The first ordinal &quot;α&quot; such that &quot;G&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) = &quot;G&quot;(&quot;α&quot;+1) is called the (transfinite) derived length of the group &quot;G&quot;, and it has been shown that every ordinal is the derived length of some group .

===p-solvable===
A finite group is p-solvable for some prime p if every factor in the composition series is a p-group or has order prime to p. A finite group is solvable iff it is p-solvable for every p.

<doc id="105016" wikidata="Q460805" url="?curid=105016" title="Langton's ant">
<text>Langton&#x27;s ant is a two-dimensional Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior. It was invented by Chris Langton in 1986 and runs on a square lattice of black and white cells. The idea has been generalized in several different ways, such as turmites which add more colors and more states.

==Rules==
Squares on a plane are colored variously either black or white. We arbitrarily identify one square as the &quot;ant&quot;. The ant can travel in any of the four cardinal directions at each step it takes. The &quot;ant&quot; moves according to the rules below:
* At a white square, turn 90° clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
* At a black square, turn 90° counter-clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit

Langton&#x27;s ant can also be described as a cellular automaton, where the grid is colored black or white and the &quot;ant&quot; square has one of eight different colors assigned to encode the combination of black/white state and the current direction of motion of the ant.

==Modes of behavior==
These simple rules lead to complex behavior. Three distinct modes of behavior are apparent, when starting on a completely white grid.

#Simplicity. During the first few hundred moves it creates very simple patterns which are often symmetric.
#Chaos. After a few hundred moves, a large, irregular pattern of black and white squares appears. The ant traces a pseudo-random path until around 10,000 steps.
#Emergent order. Finally the ant starts building a recurrent &quot;highway&quot; pattern of 104 steps that repeats indefinitely.

All finite initial configurations tested eventually converge to the same repetitive pattern, suggesting that the &quot;highway&quot; is an attractor of Langton&#x27;s ant, but no one has been able to prove that this is true for all such initial configurations. It is only known that the ant&#x27;s trajectory is always unbounded regardless of the initial configuration – this result was incorrectly attributed and is known as the Cohen-Kong theorem.

==Computational properties==

In 2000, Gajardo et al. showed a construction that calculates any boolean circuit using the trajectory of a single instance of Langton&#x27;s ant.

==Extension to multiple colors==

Greg Turk and Jim Propp considered a simple extension to Langton&#x27;s ant where instead of just two colors, more colors are used. The colors are modified in a cyclic fashion. A simple naming scheme is used: for each of the successive colors, a letter &quot;L&quot; or &quot;R&quot; is used to indicate whether a left or right turn should be taken. Langton&#x27;s ant has the name &quot;RL&quot; in this naming scheme.

Some of these extended Langton&#x27;s ants produce patterns that become symmetric over and over again. One of the simplest examples is the ant &quot;RLLR&quot;. One sufficient condition for this to happen is that the ant&#x27;s name, seen as a cyclic list, consists of consecutive pairs of identical letters &quot;LL&quot; or &quot;RR&quot;. The proof involves Truchet tiles.

The hexagonal grid permits up to six different rotations, which are notated here as N (no change), R1 (60° clockwise), R2 (120° clockwise), U (180°), L2 (120° counter-clockwise), L1 (60° counter-clockwise).

==Extension to multiple states==

A further extension of Langton&#x27;s ants is to consider multiple states of the Turing machine – as if the ant itself has a color that can change. These ants are called turmites, a contraction of &quot;Turing machine termites&quot;. Common behaviours include the production of highways, chaotic growth and spiral growth.

==Extension to multiple ants==
Multiple Langton&#x27;s ants can co-exist on the 2D plane, and their interactions give rise to complex, higher-order automata that collectively build a wide variety of organized structures. 

There are different ways of modelling their interaction and the results of the simulation may strongly depend on the choices made.

Multiple turmites can co-exist on the 2D plane as long as there is a rule that defines what happens when they meet. Ed Pegg, Jr. considered ants that can turn for example &quot;both&quot; left and right, splitting in two and annihilating each other when they meet.

<text>Acle ( ) is a market town on the River Bure on the Norfolk Broads in Norfolk, located halfway between Norwich and Great Yarmouth. It has the only bridge across the River Bure between Wroxham and Great Yarmouth.

The civil parish has an area of and in 2001 had a population of 2,732 in 1,214 households, increasing to a population of 2,824 in 1,285 households at the Census 2011. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the area of the district of Broadland.

The name &quot;Acle&quot; means &quot;oaks lea&quot;, that is, a clearing in an oak forest. In Tudor times, hundreds of oaks were felled here for timber to construct Elizabeth I&#x27;s warships.

==History==
In Roman times, Acle was a port at the head of a large estuary named &quot;Gariensis&quot;. Acle is mentioned in the Domesday Book, and in 1253 it was granted a market charter. The livestock and local farmers&#x27; market existed until into the 1970s, as did a nearby auction site; the latter is now a new housing estate and the former is part-occupied by a branch of CO-OP, with the other part remaining a market, although essentially for tourist purposes: no livestock is now bought or sold there.

In 1382, Acle received the right for a &quot;turbary&quot;, that is, the right to dig peat. Acle still has a boatyard and Boat Dyke and walks along the Bure to Upton and beyond are possible.

The Acle Straight is a turnpike road connecting Acle to Great Yarmouth. It opened in 1831. Acle railway station, which was built in 1883, lies on the Wherry Line from Norwich to Great Yarmouth. In 1892 a foundry was constructed that specialised in building windpumps for land drainage, including the last windpump built for the Broads, at Ash Tree Farm. The three-mile (5 km) £7.1m dual-carriageway A47 bypass opened in March 1989; local campaigners are still pressing for the dualling of the Acle Straight, the portion of the A47 running from Acle to Great Yarmouth, which has a relatively high accident rate.

Since the turn of the century, a walkway running from the station to the Boat Dyke has been constructed by local volunteers; this walk (known as Damgate) offers an opportunity to view indigenous flora, some of which are rare. Also on the Damgate walk, there have been repeated sightings of a kingfisher, locally known as Henry, which is said to fly under the abandoned railway bridge around mid afternoon.

Between 2009 - 2014 a series of archaeological test pits were dug in the village. The report was published in 2017

There is a high school (Acle Academy) in the town.

==Parish church of St Edmund==
The church of St Edmund is one of 124 existing round-tower churches in Norfolk. The round stage of the tower is the oldest part of the church, thought to be Saxon in origin and of a date between 850 and 950 AD. The octagonal stage was added in the 13th century, probably when the roof was raised. The battlements are from 1472. The tower houses six bells, five of which were cast in Norwich and date from 1623. The tower is reinforced with a metal frame to enable the bells to be rung safely. Entry to the church is by a porch on the north side, built in 1495. The dressed flints are in contrast with most of the walls which appear to be made of rubble.

The main body of the church, the nave, is thought on the evidence of the measurements and wall thickness to be Norman in origin. This is not immediately obvious as no Norman doorways or arches remain. In 1927, when ivy was being stripped from the outside walls, one of the buttresses collapsed revealing a find of Norman-worked stones, which were later reassembled for safekeeping in the roof stair space. It is probable that all the Norman doors and archways were demolished when the floor level was raised, perhaps to prevent flooding, in the 13th century. It is reasonable to assume that at least the foundations of the nave are Norman.

The main nave windows are 14th-century, and one near the pulpit is Tudor. The walls were probably painted at one time – a very small fragment of a dragon or a serpent-like creature still exists on the wall of the old rood staircase. The stone font in the nave is dated 1410.

A 15th-century wooden screen separates the nave from the chancel. It was not made for Acle church, and may have been brought from St Benet&#x27;s Abbey or the Augustinian priory at Weybridge. The 14th-century chancel probably replaced an apse; the windows are of 14th-century design apart from the east window which holds Victorian stained glass.

<doc id="105022" wikidata="Q23728" url="?curid=105022" title="Larry David">
<text>Lawrence Gene David (born July 2, 1947) is an American comedian, actor, writer, and television producer. He and Jerry Seinfeld created the NBC television sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, of which David was head writer and executive producer for the first seven seasons. He gained further recognition for creating and writing the HBO series &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm,&quot; in which he also stars as a fictionalized version of himself. David&#x27;s work on &quot;Seinfeld&quot; won him two Primetime Emmy Awards in 1993, for Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing in a Comedy Series; he was nominated 17 other times. 

Formerly a stand-up comedian, David went into television comedy, writing and starring in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Fridays&quot;, and writing briefly for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. He has been nominated for 27 Primetime Emmy Awards and three Golden Globe Awards. Fellow comedians and comedy insiders voted him the 23rd-greatest comedy star ever in a 2004 British poll to select &quot;The Comedian&#x27;s Comedian&quot;, and he received the Writers Guild of America&#x27;s Laurel Award in 2010. He made his Broadway debut writing and starring in the comedic play &quot;Fish in the Dark&quot; (2015). Since 2015 he has made recurring guest appearances on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where he impersonates 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who is his sixth cousin once removed.

==Early life and education==
David was born on July 2, 1947, in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City. His parents are Rose (née Regina Brandes) and Mortimer Julius &quot;Morty&quot; David, a men&#x27;s clothing manufacturer, and he has an older brother, Ken. David&#x27;s family is Jewish. His American Jewish father&#x27;s family moved from Germany to the U.S. during the 19th century, while David&#x27;s mother was born into a Polish-Jewish family in Ternopil, now in Ukraine, and her mother&#x27;s family name was Superfein.

David graduated from Sheepshead Bay High School, now defunct and operating as Frank J. Macchiarola Educational Complex, in 1965. A sign with his photo is displayed in one of the complex&#x27;s hallways. He then attended the University of Maryland, College Park, where he was a brother in Tau Epsilon Phi. He graduated in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts in history. At college, he discovered that he could make people laugh simply by being himself. After college, David enlisted in the United States Army Reserve and received training as a petroleum storage specialist. To avoid the final year of his six-year enlistment, he paid a psychiatrist to write a letter declaring him unfit for duty.

==Career==
=== 1980–1987: Stand-up and &quot;SNL&quot; ===
While a stand-up comedian, David also worked as a store clerk, limousine driver, and historian. He lived in Manhattan Plaza, a federally subsidized housing complex in Manhattan&#x27;s Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood, across the hall from Kenny Kramer, the inspiration for the Cosmo Kramer character in &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. From 1980 to 1982, David became a writer and cast member for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Fridays&quot;, where he worked with Michael Richards, who later played Kramer on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.

From 1984 to 1985, David was a writer for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) and met Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who also worked on the show in this period. During his time at &quot;SNL&quot;, he was able to get only one sketch on the air, which aired at 12:50 am, the show&#x27;s last time slot. David quit his job at &quot;SNL&quot; in the first season, angrily disparaging the quality of the show to producer Dick Ebersol, only to show up to work two days later acting as though nothing had happened. That event inspired the second-season &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Revenge&quot;. He can be heard heckling Michael McKean when McKean hosted &quot;SNL&quot; in 1984, and can be seen in the sketch &quot;The Run, Throw, and Catch Like a Girl Olympics&quot; when Howard Cosell hosted the season finale in 1985. In 1987, David was a writer and performer for &quot;Way Off Broadway&quot;, a variety talk show on Lifetime hosted by Joy Behar.

===1989–1998: Breakthrough with &quot;Seinfeld&quot;===

In 1989, David teamed up with comedian Jerry Seinfeld to create a pilot for NBC called &quot;The Seinfeld Chronicles&quot;, which became the basis for &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, one of the most successful shows in history, reaching the top of &quot;TV Guide&quot; list of the 50 greatest TV shows of all time. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it the third-best TV show of all time. David made occasional uncredited appearances on the show, playing such roles as Frank Costanza&#x27;s cape-wearing lawyer and the voice of George Steinbrenner. He was also the primary inspiration for the show&#x27;s character George Costanza. David left &quot;Seinfeld&quot; on friendly terms after the show&#x27;s seventh season and returned two years later to write the series finale in 1998. He also continued to voice Steinbrenner.

David wrote 62 &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episodes, including 1992&#x27;s &quot;The Contest&quot;, for which he won a Primetime Emmy Award and which &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked as episode 1 on its list of &quot;TV&#x27;s Top 100 Episodes of All Time&quot;. He has also been involved in other films and television series. David wrote and directed the 1998 film &quot;Sour Grapes&quot;, about two cousins who feud over a casino jackpot. It was neither a commercial nor a critical success. He has also appeared in bit roles in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Radio Days&quot; (1987) and &quot;New York Stories&quot; (1989).

===1999–2024: &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; and acclaim ===

The HBO cable television channel aired David&#x27;s one-hour special, &quot;Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, on October 17, 1999. This was followed by &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, an HBO television series whose first episode aired on October 15, 2000. The show revisits many of the themes of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and is improvised from a story outline only several pages long written by David (and, from the fifth season onward, additional writers).

The actors improvise their dialogue based on the outline, direction, and their creativity. David has said that his character in the show, a fictionalized version of himself, is what he would be like in real life if he lacked social awareness and sensitivity. The character&#x27;s numerous and frequent social faux pas, misunderstandings, and ironic coincidences are the basis of much of the show&#x27;s comedy and have led to the entry into the American pop culture lexicon of the expression &quot;Larry David moment&quot;, meaning an inadvertently created socially awkward situation. &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; has been described as depicting &quot;the things nobody wants to say, but wish they could&quot;.

The show is based on David&#x27;s life following the fortune he earned from &quot;Seinfeld&quot;; semi-retired, he strives to live a fulfilled life. Alongside David is his wife Cheryl (Cheryl Hines), his manager and best friend Jeff (Jeff Garlin), and Jeff&#x27;s wife Susie (Susie Essman). Celebrities, including comedians Richard Lewis, Wanda Sykes, and Bob Einstein, appeared on the show regularly. Actors Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen have had recurring roles as themselves.

The show is critically acclaimed and has been nominated for 30 Primetime Emmy Awards, with one win, as well as a Golden Globe win. In the first six seasons, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Jason Alexander appear in several episodes, and Jerry Seinfeld has a cameo. In season 7, the cast of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, including Michael Richards, return in a story arc involving David&#x27;s attempt to organize a &quot;Seinfeld&quot; reunion special. On June 2, 2010, the series premiered on the TV Guide Network, its network television debut. TV Guide Network also produced a series of related discussions with high-profile guest stars, media pundits, and prominent social figures called &quot;Curb: The Discussion&quot; debating the moral implications of each episode. David is quoted as saying &quot;Finally, thanks to the TV Guide Network, I&#x27;ll get a chance to watch actual, intelligent people discuss and debate the issues addressed on &#x27;Curb&#x27;. Now if only someone could tell me where this alleged &#x27;Network&#x27; is, I might even watch it.&quot; The show&#x27;s 12th and final season premiered in January 2024.

David played the leading role in Woody Allen&#x27;s 2009 comedy film &quot;Whatever Works&quot; alongside Evan Rachel Wood. He had a cameo appearance on the HBO series &quot;Entourage&quot; as a client of Ari Gold, and because his daughters were &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; fans, David and his daughters guest-starred as themselves in the episode &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Boyfriend&quot;, in which they wait for a table at a fancy restaurant. David appeared as a panelist on the NBC series &quot;The Marriage Ref&quot; and also played Sister Mary-Mengele in the 2012 reboot of &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;. He co-wrote and starred in the 2013 HBO television film &quot;Clear History&quot;. David wrote and starred in the Broadway play &quot;Fish in the Dark&quot;. Also appearing were Rita Wilson, Jayne Houdyshell, and Rosie Perez. The play centers on the death of a family patriarch. It opened on March 5, 2015. Jason Alexander took over David&#x27;s role in July. The play closed in August. As of February 1, 2015, its advance sale of $13.5 million had broken records for a Broadway show. 

==== Bernie Sanders ====
Since 2015, David has made multiple guest appearances portraying 2016 and 2020 United States presidential election candidate Bernie Sanders on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;; he also hosted the show on February 6, 2016, with musical guest The 1975 and a cameo by Sanders himself, and on November 4, 2017, with musical guest Miley Cyrus.

In 2017, PBS&#x27;s &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; discovered through genealogical research that David and Sanders are distantly related. Sanders told David the news. &quot;I was very happy about that,&quot; David said, according to &quot;Variety&quot;. &quot;I thought there must have been some connection.&quot; The comedian explained that Sanders is &quot;a third cousin or something&quot;. He is in fact David&#x27;s sixth cousin once removed.

On January 8, 2020, David joked on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, &quot;I would say, I would beg him [Bernie] to drop out so I don&#x27;t have to keep flying in from Los Angeles to do &quot;SNL&quot;. I thought when he had the heart attack that would be it, I wouldn&#x27;t have to fly in from Los Angeles. But, you know, he&#x27;s indestructible. Nothing stops this man!&quot; He later added, &quot;If he wins, do you know what that&#x27;s going to do to my life? Do you have any idea? I mean, it will be great for the country—great for the country, terrible for me.&quot;

== Influences ==
David has named Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, Phil Silvers, Abbott and Costello, Jackie Mason, Alan King, Don Rickles, and &quot;Mad&quot; magazine as influences.

==Personal life==
David lives in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. He was married to Laurie Lennard from 1993 to 2007. They have two daughters, Cazzie David and Romy David. Larry and Laurie became contributing bloggers at &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; in 2005. In 2017, David was introduced to producer Ashley Underwood at a birthday party for Sacha Baron Cohen. They married in 2020. David&#x27;s niece is actress Julie Claire, who appears in &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;.

David is an atheist and an avid sports fan. A native New Yorker, he supports the New York Jets, Yankees, Knicks, and Rangers. David is also a supporter of the Democratic Party. In 2010, he wrote an article for &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticizing the extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. He ended the article with a sarcastic thank-you to then-President Barack Obama for approving the extension.

=== Wealth ===
In 2013, Charlie Rose estimated David&#x27;s net worth at around $500 million. Two years later, two other estimates put the number between $400 million and $900 million. In 2020, &quot;National Review&quot; offered an estimate of about $400 million. 

Most of David&#x27;s wealth originates from syndication deals of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, the former having netted $3.1 billion in rerun fees as of 2013. The syndication of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; earned David an estimated $250 million in 1998 alone. In 2008, David was reported to have grossed $55 million, mostly from &quot;Seinfeld&quot; syndication and work on &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. 

David&#x27;s net worth was parodied in a 2001 episode of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;The Shrimp Incident&quot;, in which HBO executive Allan Wasserman yells at David: &quot;If you want shrimp, take your $475 million, go buy a shrimp boat.&quot;

In a 2015 interview with CBS, David confirmed that half of his wealth was eroded by his 2007 divorce in the community property state of California. &quot;I have a lot of money&quot;, he said, adding that the &quot;figures out there are crazy&quot;. 

=== Legal issue ===
David was among several celebrities who appeared in a commercial for cryptocurrency exchange FTX that aired during Super Bowl LVI. In November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, and David, alongside other spokespeople, was sued in a class-action lawsuit. In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media.

<text>Kranjska Gora (; ) is a town in northwestern Slovenia, on the Sava Dolinka River in the Upper Carniola region, close to the Austrian and Italian borders. It is the seat of the Municipality of Kranjska Gora. The tripoint between Austria, Italy and Slovenia lies on the mountain of Dreiländereck, known as Peč in Slovenia.

==Name==
Kranjska Gora was first mentioned in written sources in 1326 as &quot;Chrainow&quot; (and as &quot;Chrainau&quot; and &quot;Chrainaw&quot; in 1363, as &quot;Cranaw&quot; and &quot;Chranaw&quot; in 1390, and as &quot;Kraynaw&quot; in 1456–61, among other names). The Slovene name &quot;Kranjska Gora&quot; is a reworking of the German name, influenced by German &quot;Krainberg&quot; &#x27;Karawanks&#x27;. The settlement was also called &quot;Borovska vas&quot; (or &quot;Borovska ves&quot; or &quot;Borovška ves&quot;) in Slovene in the past.

==History==
Kranjska Gora is believed to have been settled in the 11th century by Slovenes from Carantania. It was a fief of the Counts of Ortenburg in the 12th century. A trade route to Tarvisio already led through the town in the 14th century. In 1431 the Counts of Celje built a castle at Villa Bassa (now part of Tarvisio), which belonged to the town until 1848. Kranjska Gora came under Ottoman attack in 1476. A railroad connection was built to Kranjska Gora in 1870.

During the First World War, in 1916, Russian prisoners of war built a wooden chapel above the settlement commemorating their comrades killed in an avalanche while building a road over the Vršič Pass. There is a small cemetery nearby. Commemorations take place at the chapel every year.

===Mass grave===
A mass grave from the end of the Second World War is found in the eastern part of the town. The Savsko Naselje Mass Grave (), also known as the Rušar Meadow Mass Grave (), contains the remains of up to 35 German soldiers killed in an engagement with the Partisans in May 1945.

===Postwar period===
Tourism developed further in Kranjska Gora after the Second World War. Various ski lifts were built on Mount Vitranc west of the town in 1949, 1962, 1964, and 1965, and a freight cableway was installed in 1958.

==Church==

The Counts of Ortenburg established a church dedicated to Our Lady on the White Gravel () in the 14th century, referring to the bank of the Pišnica River, which has since changed course. The current church, dedicated to the Assumption of Mary, is late Gothic in style and has typical Carinthian rib vaulting. It contains two sculptures from the second half of the 15th century and paintings by Leopold Layer (1752–1828).

==Recreation==
Kranjska Gora is best known as a winter sports town, being situated in the Julian Alps. It annually hosts an event in the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup series, also known as the Vitranc Cup, for the slalom and giant slalom events. The well-known ski jumping hill Planica is located in the nearby Tamar Valley.

==Notable people==
Notable people that were born or lived in Kranjska Gora include:
*Franjo Kogoj (1894–1983), dermatologist
*Josip Lavtižar (1851–1943), storyteller and local historian
*Janez Mencinger (1819–1909), writer

<doc id="105030" wikidata="Q5203272" url="?curid=105030" title="D-Mark">
<text>Marcos Ligero (born 7 July 1984 in Sabadell, Spain), better known as D-Mark, is a Spanish Electronic Dance Music DJ, musician and producer. Starting with the music as a hobby in the late 90s and at the early age of 13 he became an enthusiast of the dance music genre of the moment, and passed to be a mere follower to become a producer even before starting his career as a DJ.

==History==
===The first years===

D-Mark begun in the field of the music production using a tracker production software. He led a now disappeared project called Vanian-UT to spread all of these tracks made with that software across all the Spanish territory. In 2002, Vanian-UT was known in Spain as a young producers&#x27; collective with a lot of talent, that also focused on DJing, something that caught the attention of D-Mark as well. This year, Vanian-UT released with D-Mark mixes a set of CDs for the magazine &quot;Solo Tuning&quot;.

===2003–2008===
Year 2003 was a new begin for D-Mark. Focused on his DJ side and with the Vanian-UT project running at its top, the collective begun to perform their music on several clubs and events in the zone, like regular parties at &quot;Future Club&quot; in Barcelona or the event &quot;Trancenight Summer Party&quot; at Girona in 2004.

2005 was a year of changes. As new systems and computer production software became more affordable to everyone and the record deals were increasing into its members Vanian-UT was about to close, what took D-Mark to initiate and lead a new record label project called DanceDP Recordings. This idea was set up this year, but it would not come to light until the end of 2006. Meanwhile, D-Mark took his first appearance outside the zone of Catalunya, Spain, and moved to Madrid to perform a gig alongside DJ Precision and Menno de Jong, together with his friends and artists &quot;Shammu&quot;, &quot;DJ Row&quot; and the resident DJ at &quot;Future Club&quot; in Barcelona &quot;Pllo Future&quot;.

2006 and 2007 were, without a doubt, the most active at the DJ and musical career of D-Mark. During this time, he carried his music through all the Spanish territory in the cities of Ibiza, Barcelona, Madrid or Valladolid, and the countries of Norway, England and Slovenia and performing together with some of the most influenced DJs of the dance scene at these years, like Above &amp; Beyond, Lemon &amp; Einar K or Inkfish. In 2006 he made his debut abroad, in a Ministry of Sound event at Sentrum Scene in the city of Oslo, Norway.

These years were also when D-Mark set the opening of his new record label project DanceDP Recordings. The first release of the record label and the first appearance of D-Mark in the music industry as well, &quot;Travelling EP&quot;, became unexpectedly a success: 10 weeks in a row at the top positions of the &quot;Technics/IDP/DMC Dutch Dance Charts&quot; and full reviews on the Spanish magazines Deejay and DJ1, that finally ended with the DJ Oner award No. 1 Spanish trance release and the appearance of &quot;Project Norway&quot; in the album of Dave Pearce &quot;Delirium&quot; on the label Ministry of Sound.

In 2007 and 2008 D-Mark teamed up with who would be now his best friend in the music field and his studio and DJ partner G-Sus. They two together released several remixes for artists like Tragida and Der Mystik, and their hit &quot;La Lamida del Gato Negro&quot; produced in 2008 and released in 2009 got the unexpected support of the world&#x27;s top DJ Paul van Dyk.

2008 is also the starting year of D-Mark&#x27;s monthly radio/podcast project &quot;DanceDP Radio&quot;. The project begun with the appearances and the support of &quot;Raúl CC&quot; and &quot;David Amante&quot; the first year, until David left his music career. G-Sus joined the team in 2010, where he is currently an active part of the show.

===2009–present===

2009 and 2010 were two difficult years to the personal life of D-Mark that forced him to stop the recording of his already announced album debut &quot;Driving Nowhere&quot; and to leave momentarily his musical activity, that was also affecting his record label. The album was finally discarded due to the crisis that is lately passing through the music industry, especially in Spain, and the world&#x27;s economy. However, this did not stop D-Mark and G-Sus in 2009 to organize and perform a special event in Pineda de Mar, which was the one who had the biggest attendance for them of all the times in Spain, 5500 attendees.

2011 is the year, as he said, of the coming back, with a new EP release and an amateur official videoclip made for what is his favourite city, Barcelona.

<text>Cherbourg is a former commune and subprefecture located at the northern end of the Cotentin peninsula in the northwestern French department of Manche. It was merged into the commune of Cherbourg-Octeville on 28 February 2000, which was merged into the new commune of Cherbourg-en-Cotentin on 1 January 2016.

Cherbourg is protected by Cherbourg Harbour, between La Hague and Val de Saire, and the city has been a strategic position over the centuries, disputed between the English and French. Cited as one of the &quot;keys to the kingdom&quot; by Vauban, it became, by colossal maritime development work, a first-rate military port under the leadership of Napoleon I, and holds an arsenal of the French Navy. A stopping point for prestigious transatlantic liners in the first half of the 20th century, Cherbourg was the primary goal of US troops during the invasion of Normandy in 1944.

Along with its use as a military, fishing and yachting port, it is also a cross-Channel ferry port, with routes to the English ports of Poole and Portsmouth, the Irish ports of Rosslare Harbour and Dublin, and St Helier on Jersey. Limited by its geographical isolation from being a great commercial port, it is nonetheless an important shipbuilding centre, and a working-class city with a rural hinterland.
==Geography==
===Location===

Cherbourg is located at the northern tip of the Cotentin Peninsula, in the department of Manche, of which it is a subprefecture. At the time of the 1999 census the city of Cherbourg had an area of , while the city of Octeville had an area of . The largest city in the Department of Manche, it is the result of the merger of the communes of Cherbourg and Octeville. The amalgamated city today has an area of . Cherbourg is situated at the mouth of the and at the south of the bay between to the east and Cap de La Hague to the west, Cherbourg-Octeville is from the English coast.

Cherbourg and Octeville-sur-Cherbourg once belonged to the deanery of La Hague, delimited by the Divette. In 1786, a part of Equeurdreville joined Cherbourg, during the construction of the port, and then in 1802, a portion of Octeville. Since 1811, the &quot;mielles&quot; [dunes] of Tourlaville, commune of the deanery of Saire, are integrated into the Cherbourg territory known as the quarter of Val-de-Saire where the and the Saint-Clement Church were built. Thus, Cherbourg-Octeville lies both in La Hague and in the Val de Saire.

Like all Chantereyne and the area of the Mielles, the Cherbourg territory was reclaimed from the sea. Built at the level of the sea, the town developed at the foot of the Roule mountain (highest point of the old town) and la Fauconnière. Octeville is a former rural municipality, composed of hamlets, whose settlement extended from the 19th century and whose territory is highly urbanised since 1950, especially around the of the provinces and the university campus.

The bordering communes are Tourlaville to the east, Équeurdreville-Hainneville to the west, La Glacerie to the south and southeast, Martinvast to the south, and Nouainville and Sideville to the south-west.

===Geology===

Located at the end of the Armorican Massif, Cherbourg retains traces of the geologic formation, deformed granites and metamorphic schists of the Precambrian of Hercynian orogeny by the folding of the arkoses of the Cambrian and Armorican sandstone and shale of the Ordovician. These folds result in layers of sandstone tilted 45° towards the north-east on la Fauconniere (including &quot;La Roche qui pend&quot; [&#x27;the hanging rock&#x27;]) and the . These two cliffs are due to sea erosion in the Quaternary. The retreat of the sea then gave way to sand dunes and tidal marshes, destroyed by the urbanisation of the 17th and 19th centuries, identical to those of Collignon in Tourlaville.

These rocks in the soil have been used for centuries in several ways: Crushed granite extracted in Querqueville and arkoses of Becquet, have been used for the manufacture of rubble () and blocks squared for lintels. The greenschist, whose colour comes from chlorite and sericite, are used mainly for roofing in Nord-Cotentin, but also masonry in Cherbourg. The Armorican sandstone of the Montagne du Roule is used for rubble and rockfill. Most of the many quarries, which opened in the metropolitan area for building the harbour wall, are now closed.

===Hydrography===
Cherbourg is bordered by the sea. The construction of the port of trade, from 1769, accompanied by the diversion of the (the mouth of which was located at the current exit of Port Chantereyne) and the Trottebec (from the territory of Tourlaville) gathered in the &quot;canal de retenue&quot;, along the &quot;Avenue de Paris&quot; and &quot;Rue du Val-de-Saire&quot;.

The streams of the Bucaille and the Fay, which watered the &quot;Croûte du Homet&quot;, disappeared in the 18th century during the construction of the military port.

===Climate===
Cherbourg has a temperate oceanic climate. Its maritime character causes high humidity (84%) and a strong sea wind, commonly stormy but also low seasonal variations of temperature and few days of frost (7.3). The combined effect of the wind and the tides can generate a rapid change of weather in a single day, with sun and rain which can be a few hours apart.

The influence of the Gulf Stream and the mildness of the winter allow the naturalisation of many Mediterranean and exotic plants (mimosas, palms, agaves, etc.) which are present in the public and private gardens of the city, despite average insolation. The climate is similar to areas much further north in Great Britain and Ireland due to the moderation. Summers are far cooler than expected by French standards.



===Routes of communication and transport===
====Road====
Historically, Cherbourg is at the western end of Route nationale 13, which runs through the city by the &quot;Rouges Terres&quot; and the &quot;Avenue de Paris&quot;, from La Glacerie. In the 1990s, a deviation from the road, now European routes E03 and E46, referred traffic through La Glacerie and Tourlaville on a three-way axis from La Glacerie, to the Penesme roundabout at Tourlaville and then a dual carriageway to a roundabout located between Collignon Beach and the &quot;Port des Flamands&quot;. An extension to Cherbourg is in the works, with the doubling of the bridge over the &quot;Port des Flamands&quot;, to ensure a continuity of the dual carriageway to the commercial port in Cherbourg.

The old (reclassified as D901), which connects Cap de la Hague to Barfleur, crosses the city from east to west.

After the completion of the bypass east of the agglomeration, a western bypass project is under study, and a &#x27;zone&#x27; corresponding to the future final route has been selected. Similarly, upgrading to a dual carriageway for access of Maupertus Airport is envisaged.

The D650 is used to connect Cherbourg to the west coast of the Cotentin peninsula. Departing from Cherbourg, the D650 takes a southwesterly direction to Les Pieux and then along to join the &quot;Côte des Isles&quot; (the Channel Islands coast) to Barneville-Carteret. In the approach to Cherbourg, this road has undergone development, in recent years, with amenities (roundabouts, traffic lights, urban development) by virtue of the peri-urbanisation of the communes in its path.

With the awarding of autoroute status to the RN13 in 2006, the work of upgrading to motorway standard between Cherbourg and Caen is being undertaken over a 10-year period. The construction work of the RN13 at the entrance of the Cherbourg agglomeration (locality &quot;Virage des Chèvres&quot;) was completed in early 2009.

====Sea====

Cherbourg-Octeville is a port on the English Channel with a number of regular passenger and freight ferry services operating from the large modern ferry terminal and has a major artificial harbour. The following operators currently run services from the port:

* Brittany Ferries to Rosslare, Poole (1 sailing daily) and Portsmouth (up to 2 sailings daily, summer only).
* Stena Line to Rosslare (3 sailings weekly).
* Irish Ferries to Dublin (2 sailings weekly).
* Condor Ferries to Portsmouth (1 sailing weekly in summer only).

Cherbourg has previously had services operated by the following operators:

* Stena Line to Southampton (up to 2 sailings daily). Withdrawn in 1996.
* P&amp;O Ferries to Portsmouth (up to 2 sailings daily by conventional ferry and up to 3 by fast ferry during the summer). Withdrawn in 2005 following a business review.
* P&amp;O Irish Sea to Rosslare (up to 3 sailings weekly) and Dublin (weekends only during the summer). Dublin service was withdrawn in 2004 and Rosslare service sold to Celtic Link.
* HD Ferries to Guernsey and Jersey. Operated in 2007 but cancelled in 2008 due to lack of customers.
* Celtic Link Ferries to Rosslare (3 sailings weekly). Service sold to Stena Line.

The port welcomes some 30 cruise ships per year including the largest, thanks to a cruise terminal built in 2006 in the Gare Maritime de Cherbourg, which had opened in 1933 on the &quot;Quai de France&quot; next to the &quot;Cité de la Mer&quot;. Frequently, cruise ships that have planned for another destination have taken refuge in the port, for protection from the frequent storms.

Conventional cargo ships berth in the eastern area of the docks on the &quot;Quai des Flamands&quot; and &quot;Quai des Mielles&quot;. During the construction of the Concorde prototypes in the 1960s, some sections built in the United Kingdom passed by ferry through Cherbourg, for transfer to Toulouse.

====Rail====
The Paris - Cherbourg railway line, operated by Réseau Ferré de France, ends at Cherbourg railway station, which opened in 1858 and welcomes a million passengers every year. This line continued, at the beginning of the 20th century, up to the resort of Urville-Nacqueville and was complemented by the which served from Cherbourg to Val de Saire between 1911 and 1950. Today, the Intercités Paris-Caen-Cherbourg line is the most profitable in its class with profit over €10 million per year despite numerous incidents and delays.

Regular services operate to Paris-Saint-Lazare via Caen using Intercités stock, local TER services operate from the station to Lisieux via Caen and to Rennes via Saint-Lô. Intercités services to Paris-Saint-Lazare take three hours on average.

From July 2009 to December 2010, a TGV Cherbourg – Dijon service operated, via Mantes and Roissy TGV. With one daily round-trip, it operated experimentally for three years and gave the people of Cherbourg direct access by rail to France&#x27;s primary airport. The service ceased prematurely, as the minimum threshold of passenger traffic was not met.

As well as a main line station there was also the &quot;Gare Maritime Transatlantique&quot; station. This now forms part of the &quot;Cité de la mer&quot;.

====Bus====
The &quot;Compagnie des transports de Cherbourg&quot; (CTC) was created in 1896, connecting the &quot;Place de Tourlaville&quot; and the &quot;Place du Château&quot; by a in Cherbourg, then to Urville. After the German occupation and bombardment of the tram depot, the use of buses took over, and it was not until 1962 that the network had several lines. From 1976, the &quot;Communauté urbaine de Cherbourg&quot; supported the jurisdiction of public transit. Management of the public service is delegated to Keolis, the CTC took the name of Zephir Bus in 1991.

The network covers the whole of the metropolitan area. In recent years, a night bus service has also been created.

Cherbourg-Octeville and its suburbs are also served by the Manéo departmental bus service.

====Air====
The Cherbourg – Maupertus Airport, located in Maupertus-sur-Mer, serves the city. Its runway hosts charter flights. After stopping the daily service to Paris by Twin Jet, in spring 2008, a new link with Caen and Paris started with Chalair on 27 October 2008.

With 40,500 passengers in 2007, the airport had lost 30% of its commercial passengers, and 10% of its total traffic over a year.

==History==
===Heraldry===
The origin of the coat of arms is disputed.

According to Victor Le Sens, it is of religious origin: Fess argent charged of stars represents the belt of the Virgin Mary, one of the two patrons of the city and the number of stars, like the bezants, evokes the Trinity, the other patron of the city. The bezants would be the expression of the redemption of the captives, illustrating the participation of the notables of Cherbourg on the Third Crusade. The coat of arms of Cherbourg dates from the late 12th century, at the time of the Crusades.

According to M. Le Poupet, which relies in particular on the works of Vulson de la Colombière and Ségoing, the content of the coat of arms evokes the maritime trade of the city, the bezants - traditional furniture of the arms of ennobled financiers - represent wealth and fortune, while the star shows peace and prudence. The sable signifies prudence and constancy in adversity, the azure denotes activity and the seas. M. Canel had explained before him that the bezants and stars respectively illustrated trade and sea port.

The stars, absent from the armorial of d&#x27;Hozier in 1697, were added in the 18th century. Under the Empire, the coat of arms was completed by a free area of second-class towns which is to dexter azure to an &quot;N&quot; of or, surmounted by a pointed star of the same, brocading at the ninth of the escutcheon.

Regarding the external ornaments, the mural crown symbolises protection and happiness, the caduceus of trade and business, the olive tree of peace, the oak of strength, recalling the role of both the military and commercial port. The argent means that Cherbourg was a second class city under the Empire.

Today, the municipality of Cherbourg-Octeville uses a logo, entitled &quot;mouette musicale&quot; [musical seagull]. Initially adopted by Cherbourg, it consists of a gull, symbolising the maritime character of the town, on a musical stave, evoking the musicality of the port: &quot;The cry of the seagulls that dance between sky and sea, the mermaids of ships and the melodious song of the waves&quot;.

===Origins and toponymy===
The date of Foundation of Cherbourg can not be set precisely, although several local historians, including Robert Lerouvillois, trace the origin of the city to Coriallo (for *&quot;Coriovallo&quot;) of the Unelli. According to Pierre-Yves Lambert, the Celtic element &quot;corio-&quot; means &quot;army, troop&quot; and the element &quot;vallo-&quot; similar to the Latin &quot;vallum&quot;, would be &quot;rampart, fortification&quot;.

Mentioned on the &quot;Tabula Peutingeriana&quot; (c. 365), in the Antonine Itinerary and the &quot;Gesta&quot; de Fontenelle (&quot;In pago Coriovallinse&quot;, 747-753), &quot;Coriallo&quot;, Latinised then as &quot;Coriallum&quot;, hosted a Roman garrison during the late Roman Empire, and the recovered remains would be the village between Cherbourg and Tourlaville, on the Mielles.

The Cotentin Peninsula was the first territory conquered by the Vikings in their ninth century invasion. They developed Cherbourg as a port. After the Anglo-Scandinavian settlement, a new name appeared there in a still Latinised form: &quot;Carusburg Castellum&quot; (1026-1027, Fauroux 58) then &quot;Carisburg&quot; (1056–1066, Fauroux 214), &quot;Chiersburg&quot; (William of Jumièges, v. 1070), &quot;Chieresburg&quot; (Wace, &quot;Roman de Rou&quot;, v. 1175). &quot;Carusburg&quot; would mean &quot;fortress of the marsh&quot; in Old Norse &quot;kjarr&quot; (marsh), and &quot;borg&quot; (castle, fortified town) or &quot;city of the marais&quot; in Old English &quot;ker&quot; (bog) and &quot;burgh&quot; (town). The element &quot;kjarr&quot; / &quot;ker&quot; is also found in Normandy in Villequier and Orcher. According to François de Beaurepaire, it comes rather from the Old English &quot;chiriche&quot; (spelled &quot;ċiriċe&quot;, Church) or [tch] is reduced to [s], as the commune of Chirbury, in the County of Shropshire, formerly also spelled &quot;Chirichburig&quot; (915) and &quot;Chiresbir&quot; (1226).

The name of Octeville appears meanwhile, in 1063, in a Charter of William the Conqueror about allocations made to the Collegiate Church of Cherbourg. It means: &quot;the rural area of &quot;Otti&quot;&quot;, a Scandinavian male name also found in Octeville-l&#x27;Avenel, Octeville-sur-Mer and Otby (Lincolnshire, &quot;Ottebi&quot;, 11th century).

Cherbourg is also the name of a Canadian township, located between Matane and Les Méchins, which gave its name to the communes of Saint-Thomas-de-Cherbourg, merged in 1954 into Les Méchins, and Saint-Jean-de-Cherbourg. This name, including the proclamation date of 7 May 1864, could be due to the impact by the local newspapers of the inauguration of the military port by Napoleon III in 1858. Cherbourg is also the name of a town in Queensland, Australia.

===Middle Ages===

The Cotentin, conquered by Quintus Titurius Sabinus in 56 BC, was divided between the &quot;pagus constantiensis&quot; (&quot;County of Coutances&quot;) and the &quot;pagus coriovallensis&quot; (&quot;County of Coriallo&quot;), within Gallia Lugdunensis. Coriallo housed a small garrison and a castrum was built on the left bank of the Divette as an element of the &quot;Litus saxonicum&quot;, after Saxon raids at the beginning of the fourth century.

In 497, the village was sold with all of Armorica to Clovis. It was evangelised by in 432, then by Saint Exuperat, Saint Leonicien, and finally Saint Scubilion in 555. In 870, , landing in Kent, was ordained priest of Cherbourg and established a hermitage in the surrounding forest.

After several Norman raids in the ninth century, Cherbourg was attached to the Duchy of Normandy along with the Cotentin, in 933, by William Longsword. The Danish King Harold moved there in 946.

In the face of English threats, Richard III of Normandy strengthened the fortifications of the castle at the same time as those of the other major strongholds of Cotentin. In 1053, the city was one of the four main cities of the duchy of William the Conqueror to receive an annuity in perpetuity for the maintenance of one hundred needy.

In 1139, during the struggle for succession to the Anglo-Norman Crown, Cherbourg fell after two months of siege to the troops of Stephen of England before being retaken in 1142 by Geoffrey of Anjou, whose wife, Empress Matilda, three years later founded the .

During the conquest of Normandy by Philip II of France, Cherbourg fell without a fight in 1204. The city was sacked in 1284 and 1293, the abbey and the Hôtel-Dieu looted and burned, but the castle, where the population was entrenched, resisted. Following these ravages, Philip IV of France fortified the city in 1300.

Its strategic position, a key to the kingdom along with Calais as a bridgehead for invasion by the English and French, the town was much disputed during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Having one of the strongest castles in the world according to Froissart, it changed ownership six times as a result of transactions or seats, never by force of arms. The fortress resisted the soldiers of Edward III in 1346.

In February 1354, Cherbourg was transferred by John II of France to Charles II of Navarre with the bulk of the Cotentin. The city was of Navarre from 1354 to 1378, and Charles II stayed in Cherbourg on several occasions. In 1378, the city was besieged by Charles V of France as the rest of the Norman possessions of the King of Navarre, but in vain. Navarre troops who had dropped the County of Évreux and the Cotentin were entrenched in Cherbourg, already a difficult taking, and defended it against French attacks. In June 1378, having lost ground in Normandy, Charles II of Navarre rented Cherbourg in 1378 to Richard II of England for a period of three years. Bertrand du Guesclin besieged it for six months using many machines of war, but abandoned the siege in December 1378. The King of England then refused to return the city to the Navarrese, despite the efforts of Charles II. It was only his son Charles III of Navarre who recovered it in 1393. In 1404, it was returned to Charles VI of France, in exchange for the Duchy of Nemours.

Fallen in 1418 to the hands of the English, Cherbourg, the last English possession of the Duchy of Normandy after the Battle of Formigny, was released on 12 August 1450.

On 28 April 1532, Cherbourg was visited with great fanfare by Francis I and the dauphin. At that time, Cherbourg was described by Gilles de Gouberville as a fortified town of 4,000 residents, protected by drawbridges at the three main gates which were permanently guarded and closed from sunset until dawn. Inside the city walls, the castle, itself protected by wide moats and equipped with a keep and twelve towers, was south-east of the city. Outside and to the south of the city walls, the suburb along the Divette was frequented by sailors.

Cherbourg was not affected by the wind of the Reformation that divided Normandy, consolidated and heavily guarded by , Henry III thanked his defence against the troops of Montgomery, as lieutenant-general of Normandy and Governor of Cherbourg in 1578, and then marshal the following year. The bourgeois also remained loyal to Henry III and Henry IV, when Normandy was mostly held by the Catholic League.

===17th to 19th century===


To complement the two major ports of Brest on the Atlantic Ocean and Toulon on the Mediterranean Sea, Louis XIV wished to build a new port on the side of the English Channel, facing England, in order to shelter the passing ships. In 1686, Vauban offered to strengthen the fortifications of Cherbourg, and close Cherbourg Harbour with two sea walls, but preferred La Hogue for the establishment of a major military port. Fortifications and the castle development work began the following year but were stopped by the King in December 1688, influenced by Louvois and fear of English attacks. In the absence of these fortifications, the population of Cherbourg attended to the destruction of the three ships of Admiral Tourville at the end of the Battle of La Hogue.

The commercial port dug at the current position of the &quot;place Divette&quot; between 1739 and 1742, was devastated in August 1758 by an English attack under the orders of General Bligh and Admiral Howe.
During the Seven Years&#x27; War, the British briefly occupied the town after the Raid on Cherbourg in 1758. The British destroyed military buildings and warehouses before departing. With the development of a new pool of trade in 1769, Cherbourg - a longstanding commercial port of minor importance, a city without a university or cultural activity, regularly looted, and having weak relations with Paris - acquired a weight in the Cotentin which translated, on the eve of the French Revolution, by the creation of networks of sociability by the middle-class united in associations - such as the in 1755 and the lodge &quot;Faithful mason&quot;. The population increased from 800 feus (4,000 inhabitants) in Cherbourg and 95 in Octeville, around 1715, to 7,300 people in Cherbourg by 1778.

Louis XVI decided to relaunch the project of the port on the English Channel. After many delays, it was decided in 1779 to build a -long sea wall between île Pelée and the tip of Querqueville, using a method developed by Louis-Alexandre de Cessart, a pier of 90 wooden cones of by 20, filled with rubble, connected by iron chains. The first cone was immersed on 6 June 1784, and the King attended the on 22 June. But the technique did not withstand storms and was abandoned in 1788 in favour of scuttling old warships to backfill lost stones touted by La Bretonnière. However, the reduction of subsidies and the revolutionary events slowed work down, until its suspension in 1792. A new Hôtel de Ville (town hall) was completed in 1804.

First Consul Bonaparte wanted to turn Cherbourg into a major military port, for the invasion of the United Kingdom. He charged Joseph Cachin with the resumption of the work of the sea wall, the digging of military outer harbour, and the construction of the new arsenal. After a visit in 1811, Napoleon made Cherbourg a maritime prefecture, a &quot;chef-lieu&quot; of the Arrondissements of the Manche department and the seat of a court of first instance.

The work of the central sea wall, interrupted again between 1813 and 1832, ended in 1853, the east and west sea walls in 1895. The Charles X docks (begun in 1814 - 290 × 220 × 18 metres) and Napoleon III (started in 1836 - 420 × 200 × 18 m) of the military port were respectively opened on 25 August 1829, in the presence of the Dauphin, and 7 August 1858, by the Imperial couple. The work of the sea wall was concluded by the construction of the small harbour (Homet sea wall, 1899-1914 and sea wall of the Flemings, 1921–1922).

The work of the port led the intensification and spread of a modernising and developing Cherbourg, while contractors, owners, and local merchants were getting richer. Rural village housing scattered in hamlets made up around large farms (La Crespiniere, La Prevallerie, Grimesnil, La Gamacherie, etc.), connected between them and the Saint-Martin Church by a network of paths, Octeville became chef-lieu of the canton in 1801 (Decree of 23 Vendémiaire, year X) and also its population, to increase by the influx of workers who came to build the port of Cherbourg and work at the Arsenal. After the creation of the &quot;Route des Pieux&quot; (current &quot;Rue Salengro&quot; and &quot;Rue Carnot&quot;), the town was formed around an homogenised street-village then urbanising at the beginning of the 20th century.

On 16 August 1830, King Charles X, dethroned, departed into exile from the military port of Cherbourg aboard the &quot;Great Britain&quot;, leaving room for the July Monarchy. After seeing moor in its harbour &quot;Le Luxor&quot; carrying the Obelisk of Luxor in August 1833, Cherbourg welcomed the return of the remains of Napoleon to France aboard the &quot;Belle Poule&quot;. On 4 August 1858, an equestrian statue of Napoleon by the sculptor Armand Le Véel, was erected on the occasion of the visit of Napoleon III to the inauguration of the railway line from Cherbourg to Paris.

On 19 June 1864, a naval engagement in the American Civil War was held off the coast of Cherbourg: The warship of the Confederates, the CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; was sunk by the ship of the Union USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot; after two hours of fighting [see the Battle of Cherbourg (1864)], under the eye of thousands of spectators, who had arrived by train for the inauguration of the casino. Visualizing the fight from a sailboat, Manet immortalised it in &quot;The Battle of the Kearsarge and the Alabama&quot;. In November 1984, the French Navy mine hunter &quot;Circé&quot; discovered a wreck under nearly of water off Cherbourg. The location of the wreck (WGS84) was 49°45&#x27;147N / 001°41&#x27;708W. Captain Max Guerout later confirmed the wreck to be of the CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;.

===Early 20th century===
From 1847, the geographical and technical properties of the port of Cherbourg attracted shipping companies linking European ports to the east coast of the United States. At the end of the 1860s, the ships of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company and the Hamburg America Line anchored in the harbour before crossing the Atlantic. After leaving Southampton, England, the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; made its first stop at Cherbourg on 10 April 1912, during its maiden voyage, where an additional 274 passengers embarked. In 1913, Cherbourg received 500 ships and 70,000 passengers.

On 31 July 1909, Tsar Nicholas II and French president Armand Fallières met officially in Cherbourg to reinforce the Franco-Russian Alliance.

During the First World War, traffic was completely suspended. Cherbourg became the place of arrival for equipment and the British and American troops, and for departure on leave and injuries. The military port experienced an increase in activity, and the garrison stationed at Cherbourg was reinforced. The port infrastructures were developed to receive coal and oil required for the conflict. Traffic doubled, reaching 600,000 tons in 1918.

Transatlantic transit resumed in the aftermath of the war with the British, American and Dutch transatlantic companies. To welcome the best stopovers, the Chamber of Commerce built a deep water port, a new ferry terminal, and an area dedicated to loading, unloading and storage of goods in the field of Mielles. Cherbourg became the first port of migration in Europe, and Cunard Line, White Star Line and Red Star Line companies united to build the &quot;Hôtel Atlantique&quot; [Atlantic Hotel] intended to receive emigrants before crossing. At the same time, the downtown was renovated, especially in the architectural projects of René Levesque, Drancey and . However, the 1929 crisis put an end to the transatlantic peak.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War (1939–1945), the German Army occupied the north of France and fortified the coastline against invasion. As a deep-water port, Cherbourg was of strategic importance, very heavily protected against seaborne assault.

German troops arrived in the outskirts of Cherbourg on 17 June 1940, towards the end of the Battle of France. Two days later, the City Council declared the city open, and &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Erwin Rommel, commander of the 7th Panzer Division, received the surrender of the city from the hands of the maritime prefect, Vice-Admiral , who had earlier destroyed submarines under construction at the arsenal and East Fort.

Four years later, Cherbourg, the only deep-water port in the region, was the primary objective of the American troops who had landed at Utah Beach during the Battle of Normandy. The Battle of Cherbourg was required to give the Allies a point of logistic support for human resupply and material of the troops. American troops encircled the city on 21 June 1944. At the end of furious street fighting and bitter resistance from the Fort du Roule, &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Karl-Wilhelm von Schlieben, &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; Walter Hennecke and 37,000 German soldiers surrendered on 26 June to Major General Joseph Lawton Collins, Commanding General (CG) of the U.S. VII Corps. After a month of demining and repairs by American and French engineers, the port, completely razed by the Germans and the bombing, welcomed the first Liberty ships and became, until the victory of 1945, the busiest port in the world, with traffic double that of New York. It was also the endpoint of the gasoline which crossed the English Channel via the underwater pipeline PLUTO (Pipe Line Under The Ocean), and the starting point of the Red Ball Express, truck transport circuit to Chartres.

Cherbourg was returned to France by the Americans on 14 October 1945. It was cited in the Order of the Army on 2 June 1948 and received the Croix de guerre with Palm.

===Postwar===
The wartime destruction was mainly concentrated around the military port in Cherbourg but had hit 60% of Octeville. Thanks to the urgency of the port reconstruction, economic activity resumed quickly. Cherbourg, headed by former SFIO Minister , built much social housing. The postwar boom led to the modernisation of the economy and a greater role for female employment. Under the leadership of General de Gaulle, Cherbourg became the hub of nuclear ballistic missile submarine construction from 1964, including the first, &quot;Le Redoutable&quot;, which was launched in 1967. Félix Amiot&#x27;s shipyard Constructions Mécaniques de Normandie, specialised in military armaments, became famous during the Christmas of 1969 in an episode of the Cherbourg Project.

Incorporated in 1970, the gathered together Cherbourg and Octeville, La Glacerie, Tourlaville, Querqueville and Équeurdreville-Hainneville.

From the end of the 1960s, the nuclear industry emerged through the construction sites of the La Hague reprocessing plant and the Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant in addition to submarines of the DCN. A union of trade unions, left-wing activists and environmentalists, formed around the fear of the &quot;nuclearisation&quot; of Nord-Cotentin, crystallised in January 1979 when the &quot;Pacific Fisher&quot; landed with the first spent nuclear waste from Japan. On the eve of the 1980s, the Cherbourg agglomeration was hit by several violent social conflicts, particularly due to the closure of the Babcock factories.

===Turn of the millennium===
The major decisions of the public authorities, on which Cherbourg has depended for many centuries, and the nuclear industry, caused a deep economic crisis in the 1990s. The Arsenal was drastically downsized, the Northern Fleet (FLONOR) moved to Brest in 1992, and the closed. UIE, Burty, CMN, Socoval and Alcatel accumulated social plans or closings. Under the auspices of the , the agglomeration developed its academic offerings with the IUT of Cherbourg-Manche, the School of Engineers of Cherbourg and a branch of the University of Caen, which complemented and the School of Fine Arts.

The new millennium began with the creation of a new commune. Cherbourg-Octeville was created on 1 March 2000 through the joining of Cherbourg and Octeville, following a local referendum within &quot;Grand Cherbourg&quot;. The city revived its tourist and maritime identity through the Cité de la Mer and the opening to the public of the &quot;Redoubtable&quot;, and became the home of stopovers for cruises and nautical events. The &quot;between land and sea&quot;, with an emphasis on the commercial and touristic attractiveness of the city and the Bassins Quarter, as well as the economic specialisation in boating, emerged. Meanwhile, the traditional activities of the port (passengers, freight and fishing) were in crisis.

===Miscellany===
The Norman language writer Alfred Rossel, a native of Cherbourg, composed many songs which form part of the heritage of the region. Rossel&#x27;s song &quot;Sus la mér&quot; (&quot;on the sea&quot;) is often sung as a regional patriotic song. The local dialect is known as Cotentinais.

La Glacerie was named for glass factory. In 1655, Louis Lucas de Néhou built a glass factory which produced windows and mirrors for such buildings as the Galerie des Glaces and Château de Versailles. The factory in La Glacerie was destroyed by Allied bombardments in 1944 during the Normandy invasion.

Cherbourg was the first site outside the United States to be designated as an American Civil War Heritage Site by the Civil War Preservation Trust because a sea battle was fought nearby in 1864 by Union and Confederate warships. See the Battle of Cherbourg (1864).

==Population==
===Urban fabric===

Cherbourg originally developed on the left bank of the mouth of the , around the castle. Traces of the ancient fortress are rare in the modern city; the fortification was located in the area bounded by the &quot;Rue de la Marine&quot;, &quot;Quai de Caligny&quot;, the &quot;Foch&quot;, &quot;Gambetta&quot;, &quot;Albert-Mahieu&quot; and &quot;François-Lavieille&quot; streets, and &quot;La République&quot; and &quot;La Trinité&quot; squares. The city had five streets: &quot;Grande Rue&quot;, &quot;Rue de la Trinité&quot; (today, Tour-Carrée), the &quot;Rue du Nouet&quot; (to the Blé), the &quot;Rue au Fourdray&quot; and &quot;Rue Onfroy&quot; (of trade), and a dozen boëls (alleys). These five medieval streets were transformed into pedestrian streets in the 1980s. Until the destruction of the city walls, the main road called &quot;rue de-devant-le-château&quot;, was built on its west (east is bordered by ditches) with several houses with arcades, called &quot;soliers&quot;. After the dismantling of the walls, inside which lived three-fifths of the population, the city extended up to its natural boundaries at the end of the 17th century: the Divette in the east, and Chantereine stream in the west. During the 19th century, it extended to the neighbouring annexed territories of Tourlaville and Équeurdreville. Its rapid growth from the end of the 18th century was spoken of by Jean Fleury, in 1839, in that it &quot;offers almost everywhere the appearance of a new town; the old streets occupy little space, and the others are generally large and airy, the fountains numerous [...]. Cherbourg has 10 squares, 59 streets, 12 cul-de-sacs and 5 passages.&quot;

Damaged during all eras, rebuilt in piecemeal, the city has no architectural unity. Shale, extracted from the quarries of the agglomeration, is the traditional material of construction. With widespread coverage in the northern Cotentin, it is also used in Cherbourg for the walls in the city, apparent or often covered with a grayish or sometimes colourful coating. The frames are then Valognes stone (limestone), pink granite of Fermanville, or brick, and the underpinnings Armorican sandstone of the Roule and the Fauconniere. The expansion of the city from the 18th century contributed to the diversity of materials. The use of Caen stone and industrial brick was necessary under the Second Empire, while vernacular architecture disappeared gradually in these years in favour of a more homogeneous and Parisian style.

Cherbourg and its agglomeration urbanised around the ports and along the coast. With post-war reconstruction and the economic development of the Trente Glorieuses, the city is experiencing a crisis of housing due to the demographic boom, having built on the last vacant land. Indeed, a 1954 report evaluated 1,000 inhabitant families living in slums and called for 1,500 housing units. Then out of land &quot;Cité du Casino&quot; in 1957 and the &quot;Cité Fougère&quot; in 1958, then in 1959 all of the &quot;Amont-Quentin&quot;, &quot;Charcot-Spanel&quot; and &quot;Cité Chantereyne&quot; to accommodate the families of the engineers and officers of the Arsenal.

Port Chantereyne and the Mielles lands are reclaimed from the sea, the &quot;Place Divette&quot; and &quot;Boulevard Schuman&quot; are created at the site of the old fairground. However, at that time, the change mainly affected nearby villages that formed an agglomeration in less than forty years. Octeville, a dispersed habitat until the 18th century, and urbanised during the work of the port around a central street, saw the housing estate of the Provinces settle on the heights of la Fauconniere and triple its population in 20 years. Several estates also emerging at Tourlaville, La Glacerie, Querquerville and Equeurdreville, amending the physiognomy of a suburb which densified. This urbanisation resulted in the dilution of the geographic and sociological boundaries of the agglomeration resulting in the creation in 1970 of the until the merger of Cherbourg and Octeville in 2000.

Following this merger, a plan of urban renewal named &quot;Between Land and Sea&quot; was launched in 2002 on the quarters of Bassins, of the Amont-Quentin and the Provinces to homogenise the territory of the newly alamgamated city. The Bassins quarter, released by the channelling of the Divette and the filling of the retaining channel, is expected to profoundly transform the commercial landscape of the city, carried by the construction of a new shopping centre and the renovation of downtown. On the heights, seven HLM tower blocks are intended for demolition to improve social housing. A 3-star hotel and the relocation of the casino is also planned. At &quot;Avenue Carnot&quot;, the former Grouard warehouses must leave room for parking and a place through from the wharf from the &quot;Quai de l&#x27;Entrepôt&quot; to the Pasteur Hospital, to 180 dwellings by Presqu&#x27;île habitat and ADIM (Vinci company) then 100 extra in a second round of development.

The administrative quarters are:

*Downtown, historic heart of Cherbourg, with the inner city and the districts of La Polle and the Vœu, dating from the 19th century.
*The Val-de-Saire, annexed in 1811, beyond the Divette and swing-bridge.
*Sud-est, corresponding to the districts of du Roule and Maupas, traditionally for workers.
*The Amont Quentin-Provinces, on the heights of the city, built from the late 1950s (essentially HLM tower blocks).
*Octeville-Bourg, from both sides of the Salengro and Barbusse streets.
*Ouest, western part of the former municipality of Octeville.

Since 1996, Cherbourg-Octeville is covered by a sensitive urban zone on the expanded area of the Provinces.

=== Demography ===

The construction of the dam and the military port has brought an important flow of workers and soldiers. Cherbourg and Octeville have seen their populations quadruple in a century. Cherbourg had 43,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the 20th century. During this century, Cherbourg lost some 15,000 inhabitants, while Octeville grew continuously, with an explosion in the 1960s and 1970s, during the construction of the housing estates.

According to estimates from INSEE for 2018, Cherbourg-Octeville has 35,545 inhabitants. It is the largest city of the Manche department, and second of Lower Normandy (after Caen), surpassing Alençon, which had been second before the amalgamation. Cherbourg concentrated 7.7% of the departmental population, twice as much as the prefecture, Saint-Lô, while the agglomeration represents 17% and the urban area 23.5%.

The depopulation of the city-centre of the agglomeration was one of the main topics of the campaign for the municipal elections of 2008. In addition to the battle of figures on the number of lost inhabitants, the three candidates, Bernard Cazeneuve (PS), Jean Lemière (UMP) and Hervé Corbin (dissident UMP) indicated a new interest in this problem. The urbanisation of the Grimesnil/Monturbet zone, provided for the coming years, should logically bring extra population, although no one knows if it will be enough to stop the demographic bleeding.



Today, the neighbouring communes of the metropolitan area (Martinvast, Nouainville, Tonneville, Bretteville, etc.) are experiencing a demographic boost: The framework of life, rural and peaceful, in no way prevents the inhabitants from taking advantage of the infrastructure of the urban community. This problem, which is found in many French towns of this size, has led to the constitution of a , the urban community who wish to so participate financially in the rich and the .

Since the merger between Cherbourg and Octeville, in February 2000, the inhabitants are officially called &quot;Cherbourgeois-Octevillais&quot;. Before, the inhabitants of Cherbourg was called the &quot;Cherbourgeois&quot; and those of Octeville were the &quot;Octevillais&quot;. It is likely that, with the merger, the latter disappears gradually in favour of &quot;Cherbourgeois&quot;. This would be similar to &quot;Équeurdrevillais&quot; (or sometimes &quot;Équeurdrais&quot;) for the nearby of Équeurdreville-Hainneville, which merged communes in 1965.

===Housing===
Cherbourg and Octeville have two different profiles. The first is the city centre, with varied habitat, the other a commune in suburbs, built quickly from the 1960s.

===Parks and green spaces===
The second half of the 19th century saw the creation of many English-style gardens. The first was due to Joseph Cachin created while he was responsible for the construction of the port, a private garden and a pond near the , instead of the current railway line leading to the station. The temperate oceanic climate favours the naturalisation of southern and exotic plants such as palm trees, brought back by many Cherbourg sailors and explorers. Then, under the Third Republic, public gardens opened.

Today the city offers several green spaces:

*The of , on the &quot;Avenue de Paris&quot;, was the first park to be offered to the population, in 1887. At the foot of the &quot;Montagne du Roule&quot;, it hosts many animals (sea lions, aviaries, deer, etc.). A commemorative site preferred by the municipality, it contains the monument to the dead inaugurated in 1924, the old portal of the Abbey of the Vœu, the bust of Jean-François Millet, and the last town bandstand. Two pavilions of angles constructed in 1889 limit the garden on the &quot;Avenue de Paris&quot;.
*The Emmanuel Liais Park is the former garden of the Mayor of Cherbourg&#x27;s house, designed in 1881 and opened in 1885. Bequeathed to the city upon his death, it is very wooded and has an observation tower, a plan of water containing water lilies and other aquatic plants and two greenhouses sheltering rare plants, including a rich collection of South American plants brought back from his travels and acclimated by Liais. It is labelled as a Remarkable Garden.
*The Montebello garden, opened in 1872 in the street of the same name, within the Napoleon III Quarter, was created at the initiative of the Horticultural Society of Cherbourg for its members. Open to the public since its inception, it contains bamboos, camellias and magnolias, and offers a chalet of bricks with beams.
*The Park of the , a Cherbourg-Octeville property on the territory of Tourlaville, was developed by the Vicomte René de Tocqueville from 1872, with an English garden and a woodland. The park and the greenhouse built between 1872 and 1875, which is home to palm, banana, cactus and lianas have been open since the acquisition by the city of Cherbourg in 1935, and are classified as historical monuments since 4 March 1996. Several water bodies welcome Black Swans and the aviaries are home to rare birds. An artificial waterfall was created in 1921.
*The [wild valley] contains hedgerows, wetlands, orchards and woodland in the heart of Octeville, in a natural area of .

A private garden, the Botanical Garden of the Roche Fauconnière, is also listed in the inventory of Historic Monuments since 29 December 1978. Established in 1873, it was embellished over generations by the Favier family.

The commune also has allotments, managed by associations: Vallon Sauvage, Fourches, Roquettes, Saint Sauveur and Redoute, which gives free land to its members.

In 2007, the municipality was awarded four flowers in the competition of flowery towns and villages. The beautification policy, which dates from 1995, resulted in obtaining a first flower, followed by a second in 2000 and third in 2002. It relies on public gardens, heirs to a local botanical heritage of over a century, of flower beds and of green space on events such as &quot;Le Mois des Jardins et Presqu’île en Fleurs&quot; [The Month of Gardens and Peninsula in Flowers], and the annual distribution of geraniums to the resident volunteers.

==Economy==
===Historic===

At the instigation of Colbert, the guild of drapers was founded on 16 April 1668, the manufacture of cloth produced two thousand pieces per year. Two years earlier, Colbert had also promoted the introduction of the glass factory in the forest of Tourlaville.

In the 18th century, the economic resources came mainly through maritime trade, the preparation of cured meats and the harbour and breakwater works, plus a moribund textile industry. On the eve of the French Revolution, salt was imported from Le Croisic along with British grain, and Littry coal. Exports were mainly to Britain (sheets and clothes) and the West Indies (cattle and mules, fat and salted butter, salted meats, cod, linens and canvas), but also to Le Havre and La Rochelle for wood and coal. Lawful or otherwise exchanges also took place with the Channel Islands (tanbark, grain and wool). Cherbourg shipowners were absent from significant fishing, including that of cod on the banks of Newfoundland, which was a specialty of Granville. 361 workers (1764) and 69 skilled workers (1778) of the factory annually produced (1760) 2,000 fine linens in green and white strip. Cherbourg also had seven producers of starch. Opened in 1793 at the location of the current Lawton-Collins Wharf, the arsenal was moved in 1803 on a decision by Napoleon, within the project of the military port. Sailing ships were built, the first, the brig &quot;La Colombe&quot;, was launched on 27 September 1797, and then screw-propelled vessels up to the end of the 19th century. From 1898, the Arsenal specialised in the . The first were &quot;Le Morse&quot; and &quot;Le Narval&quot;. Since then, more than 91 vessels have been built there.

&quot;L&#x27;Annuaire de la Manche&quot; [The Yearbook of Manche] in 1829 mentioned several slate quarries in the agglomeration whose product was sometimes exported to Le Havre, two printers, two soda refineries (properties of Mr. Le Couturier and Messrs. Crenier and Co. producing approximately 600 tonnes for Ostend, Dunkirk, Rouen and Paris, Germany and Russia), a sugar refinery (Mr. Despréaux) whose 50 tonnes were sold in the English Channel, a lace factory run by four nuns on behalf of Messrs. Blod and Lange and several tanners. It is indicated that the port trade was based on exportation of mules to Réunion and the Antilles, salted meat of pigs and eggs in Britain, wine and brandies, and the import of Scandinavian, Polish and Russian wood, linseed, and hemp. But its use as a place of war hampered the development of Cherbourg as major commercial port, compared to Le Havre. Ten years later, for these exchanges, counted 225 to 230 both French and foreign, from 30 to 800 tons, ships each carrying 6 to 18 crew. He added the maritime buildings and armaments and the export of butter of La Hague, and the total annual trade was estimated at between 4 or 5 million francs, of which one million for the export of eggs to the United Kingdom, and 850 tons of salted meat.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Cherbourg was primarily a military port. The commercial port was modest, always exporting mules to the West Indies and Réunion and local food products to Britain (butter, meats, eggs, cattle, etc.), but also chemical products of soda extracted from kelp, granite from nearby quarries, and important wood and iron from Nord, tar, hemp, and food from the colonies. At this time the port embraced the transatlantic epic. Cherbourg&#x27;s industry was then specialised in shipbuilding, as well as in lace-making and the manufacture of rope. The late 19th century also saw Cherbourg develop an aviation industry, through the company of Félix du Temple, taken over in 1938 by Félix Amiot, another aviation pioneer for the aerospace company of Normandy. Gradually, workers developed a particular skill in metalwork, both for the submarines of the Arsenal, for aircraft and ships of the Amiot shipyards or Babcock-Wilcox boilers.

In 1916, Nestlé introduced its first French factory in Cherbourg.

The 1960s saw a revival of the local economy through the increase in the female workforce and the decline of agricultural employment in favour of diversification of jobs and a high-tech industry. In 1960, under the leadership of Mayor Jacques Hébert, Hortson was established in the Maupas quarter. One hundred employees manufactured projectors and film cameras, particularly for the ORTF and Russian television. Redeemed, the factory specialised under the name of Thomson-CSF audiovisual in surveillance and medical cameras, then in the production of electronic circuits of computer terminals on behalf of Constructions Mécaniques de Normandie and the Arsenal. Since 1976, it has been dedicated to the production of microwave electronic devices, employing 260 workers in 1979 contracted for radars of the Mirage F1 Army Air and of the Navy Super Etendards, rising to 400 employees at the end of the 1980s, after moving in 1987 into a new modernised factory in Tourlaville. For a decade, the electronic workshop expanded, adding a production line for mobile television relays, and a workshop for mechanical surface treatment. As part of the internal restructuring of Alcatel, the site, which has 300 employees, was sold in 2002 to Sanmina-SCI, which ceased its activity in March 2008. The &quot;Compagnie industrielle des télécommunications&quot; (CIT), merged the following decade with Alcatel, it also opened an assembly plant for electronic telephone exchanges, at Querqueville in the 1960s. The unit, seen as a flagship of French industry by the new president of the Republic in 1981, was considered unnecessary after the integration of Thomson&#x27;s telephony division with Alcatel in 1984 and suffered heavy redundancies from the end of the 1980s, before closing in 1997 at the end of a difficult social conflict.

Between the 1970s and 1990s, the two major projects of northern Cotentin, the La Hague reprocessing plant and the Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant, accentuated the industrial development of a city that saw a golden age through what the journalist François Simon called &quot;industries of death&quot;, since about two thirds of the local industrial fabric was related to defence and the nuclear industry.

Cherbourg is also the cradle of the Halley family and society, which became Promodès in the 1960s ( hypermarkets, Champion supermarkets). In 1999, Promodès merged with Carrefour. The old buildings of Halley House became the technical centre of the Cachin vocational school, on &quot;Avenue Aristide-Briand&quot;.

===Economic data===
In 1999, the economically active population of Cherbourg and Octeville was 18,671 inhabitants in a total population of 42,288 inhabitants.

Cherbourg-Octeville supports an unemployment rate (19.6% in 1999), double that of its job base (9.3% in 2006, a decrease of 1.1% in one year) which itself has the highest unemployment of the basins of employment of the department. At 31 December 2004, there were 3,700 jobseekers. Therefore, the annual average household income is lower than the national average (€13,730 for the city, compared with €15,027 in France) despite an average monthly salary (€1,590 in 2001) highest job growth of the department and higher than that of Caen-Bayeux (€1,550).

===Main activities===
Cherbourg is the seat of the particularly manages the airport, the fishing ports of Cherbourg and the trade, and, together with the , the FIM group training organisation.

*Major Employers on 1 January 2001
*Maritime sector

The Cherbourg economy derives a large part of its activities from its maritime position. Cherbourg indeed has : A military port, a fishing port, a port of commerce (passenger traffic and cross-border goods) and a marina.

Weakened since the 1990s, the commercial port sees the transit of 110,000 trucks to or from Ireland and Great Britain. Project Fastship, involving container transport from Philadelphia (United States) by high-speed vessels and oped for fifteen years, has been forgotten in favour of the Motorways of the Sea in the context of the Ena (Eurocoast Network Association), with Cuxhaven (Germany), Ostend (Belgium), Rosslare (Ireland) and Ferrol (Spain), with no more effect at the moment.

In recent years, the cross-Channel passenger traffic has declined, with competition from Caen-Ouistreham and the Pas-de-Calais. The withdrawal of the P&amp;O company, which served Poole and Southampton, has left two companies with cross-Channel links: Brittany Ferries to Portsmouth and Poole and Irish Ferries to Rosslare (Ireland). In the first eleven months of 2007 compared with the same period of 2006, passenger traffic declined by 3.84% to 750,000 units, while freight fell 4.43% with 87,000 trucks landed. For comparison, the port had 1.7 million passengers and 138,000 trucks in 1995.

Property, with the Port of Caen-Ouistreham, of the joint association Ports Norman Associates, involving the and the Departmental Councils of Manche and Calvados, port trade is managed by a joint company of the and . The construction of a terminal dedicated to the traffic of coal from South America and destined for the United Kingdom will put an end to the haemorrhage of the activity of the port.

The fishing industry is affected by the crisis affecting the entire industry, and the port has seen its fleet decline.

Cherbourg was the first French marina by number of visitors in 2007, having 10,117 boats for 28,713 overnight stays in 2007, and the total impact estimated at €4 million for the Cherbourg agglomeration.

A tradition of local industry, shipbuilding is based on the two pillars of the DCNS Cherbourg for submarines and Constructions Mécaniques de Normandie (CMN), famous for their speedboats. This sector has been widely restructured over the past twenty years. The military arsenal saw the end of the construction of the &quot;Redoutable&quot;-class submarines and expanded its customer base, until then exclusively of the Navy, prior to being privatised in 2007. With diesel &quot;Agosta&quot; submarines, developed since 1994 for Pakistan, and the &quot;Scorpène&quot;, in collaboration with the shipyards of Cartagena, sold to Malaysia, Chile and India, 25% of the total turnover of the establishment is of foreign origin. Partnerships with Pakistan and India have concluded to make the construction term at home. The CMN, which employed 1,200 people at the beginning of the 1980s, modernised and automated, and now has 500 employees. The company diversified into large luxury yachts, without abandoning the military market, and has signed such contracts with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar through the Franco-Lebanese businessman Iskandar Safa, owner since 1992.

While these two military companies have experienced reductions in loads (the number of jobs at the Arsenal increased from 6,000 including 1,000 subcontracted, in 1988, to 2,600 including 500 subcontractors), and the companies have repositioned in the nautical industry. , a subsidiary of CMN with 100 employees, built racing yachts. Originally hosted by CMN to build aluminium hulls designed by James Ébénistes (Saint-Laurent-de-Cuves), Allures Yachting has specialised in cruising sailboats. The Allais shipyard, of Dieppe, has established a subsidiary, ICAN, dedicated to civilian boats and pleasure craft.

A network of subcontractors and specialists formed around this hub through Ameris France (established in 1994 under the name of &quot;Cap 50 export&quot;, specialised in the research and the supply of spare parts for ships and military aircraft), the Efinor group (founded in 1988, specialising in metallurgy, nuclear decommissioning and engineering), MPH (help in project control, 140 employees). At Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue, Facnor has become a global specialist of sailing reels.

The Navy employs nearly 3,000 officials in the agglomeration, especially in the context of administration (maritime prefecture), maritime safety (customs, CROSS, Abeille), logistical support of the French Navy and foreign passage, and of training.
*Metallurgy

Metallurgy has long represented a large source of employment in the agglomeration. Around the Arsenal and its boilermakers, several metalworking and mechanical industries were formed from the early 1900s. This is the case of the oldest business the city, the Simon Brothers company, founded in 1856, which went from being a mechanical workshop to a steam agricultural machinery manufacturer and then to an agribusiness in a half a century.

Manufacturing guns in 1870 and 1939, the company became a world leader in churns and mixers for the butter industry. Similarly, the Babcock boiler manufacturer was implanted in Cherbourg in the interwar period and closed its doors after a protracted labour dispute, in 1979. Later, the began business in Cherbourg in 1973, for the construction of oil platforms, but closed in 1985.

*Agri-food

The food industry, essential in Lower Normandy, is not absent from the employment pool. A farm raising salmon in the harbour, abattoirs handling farmed livestock of Nord-Cotentin, and several processing companies exist. The Simon Brothers (50 employees) have supplied equipment for the cider and dairy industries for more than a century.

*Electronics

Alcatel had two units in the 1980s, one in Cherbourg, then Tourlaville (formerly Thomson-CSF) the other in Querqueville (Alcatel CIT). Both, regarded as flagships of the group, specialised respectively in microwave and electronic telephone exchanges. However, Alcatel decided to close the Querqueville factory in 1997, Codifur then took over part of the business with hundreds of employees. In 2002, it also offloaded the Tourlaville unit to Sanmina-SCI, which relocated its production six years later. Codifur resumed the after-sales service business of Alcatel, or 5% of the initial activity, and a few dozen employees.

*Other industries

Socoval, a manufacturer of menswear of the Cantoni Group from Italy, is the last textile factory of the Cotentin and employs about 100 employees, since the social plan of 2001, which resulted in the loss of about 40 employees.

Economic partners now rely on the &quot;mastery of atmosphere&quot;, i.e. the control of contamination from industrial processes, through the created in 2001. Having experience of work involving nuclear risk, it wants to transfer these skills to the food, electronics and pharmaceutical industries. Two courses have been designed for this purpose: A BTS in nuclear maintenance at the Lycee Tocqueville and a DESS in mastery of atmosphere at the Cherbourg School of Engineering.

*Commerce

The urban community, the main commercial centre of the Cotentin, has four hypermarkets covering - of which one, Carrefour (260 employees), located in the Cherbourg area, represents the third largest private employer of the commune - as well as several large specialist stores. Trade employs nearly 1,400 people in the city centre, but the decline in cross-Channel traffic has caused a big shortfall, exacerbated by the fragile local economy.
Although downtown Cherbourg is the main commercial centre of the agglomeration, with 340 establishments, its dominance is lower in the urban community, when compared to Caen towards its agglomeration. Indeed, Cherbourg focuses 35% of commercial activities and 45% of retail trade in the agglomeration, against 40% and 55% for the centre of Caen respectively, particularly two-thirds of the human equipment stores against 90% in Lower Normandy&#x27;s capital. Grocery chains, equipment and home appliances have left the city centre for out-of-town shopping centres. The number of fast food outlets doubled between 1995 and 2005, while the strength of the traditional catering has stagnated.

*Services

Cherbourg-Octeville, the largest city of the department, is the main centre for administration and services for the Cotentin. Health is an important provider of jobs with the (470 beds, second of Lower Normandy, merged since 2006 with the Hospital of Valognes) and the Cotentin Polyclinic. The same goes for the education sector with four public and four private schools, a marine high school and aquaculture, a university campus and several graduate schools. The branches of public enterprises are also located there (EDF, with 120 officers and SNCF, with 50 officers). Public employment represents an important part with, in addition to the hospital and schools, municipal and community staff.

Business service companies are also present in computer science (Euriware, 85 employees), cleanliness (Onet, 240 employees, and Sin&amp;Stes, 100 employees) and advertising (Adrexo, 50 employees).

Cherbourg-Octeville hosts the headquarters of public radio, and the departmental daily &quot;La Presse de la Manche&quot; (120 employees with his CES press), successor to the Libération de , and subsidiary of the since 1990. France 3 Normandie boasts a local editorial office in the city; Cherbourg&#x27;s edition of covers the agglomeration, La Hague and the Val de Saire; local television has installed its headquarters and its main studio in the area.

Jobs in the construction sector are divided between Faucillion (80 employees), Eiffage (75 employees) and Colas (60 employees).

Since its opening, the &quot;Cité de la Mer&quot; is the tourist engine of Nord-Cotentin. The cruise terminal also attracts liners each year. The marina of 1,500 spaces is the first French port of call (11,000 per year). The capacity of the city was, as of 1 January 2007, 15 hotels and 429 rooms. The casino, owned by the Cogit Group is the 109th in France, with a turnover of €6.7 million.

==Politics and administration==
In 2010, the commune of Cherbourg-Octeville was awarded a 3-star equivalent &quot;&quot; label and was upgraded to a 4-star equivalent rating in 2012.

===Administrative divisions===
The city has the of two cantons: Canton of Cherbourg-Octeville-1 (to the west) and Cherbourg-Octeville-2 (in the east, which also includes the town of La Glacerie). are the Socialists Frédéric Bastian, Anna Pic, Karine Duval and Sébastien Fagnen.

The arrondissement of Cherbourg has 189 municipalities and 190,363 inhabitants. The sub-prefect is Jacques Troncy, former sub-prefect of Montbéliard, appointed 17 March 2014.

Since 1986, the , known as Cherbourg, covered the three cantons of Cherbourg-Octeville, and those of Equeurdreville-Hainneville, and Tourlaville. In the context of the legislative redistricting of 2010, the two cantons of Beaumont-Hague and Quettehou integrated the constituency of Cherbourg-Octeville, becoming the 4th constituency. Despite this redistribution often perceived as advantageous for the right, the outgoing Socialist deputy of the 5th constituency, Bernard Cazeneuve, was re-elected in the first round with 55% of the vote.

Cherbourg-Octeville also has the headquarters of the maritime prefecture of the English Channel and the North Sea, whose authority extends from the Bay of Mont Saint-Michel to the Belgian border. The is the Vice Admiral of the Squadron, Bruno Nielly. The maritime quarter of Cherbourg (initials: CH) is restricted to the limits of the department.

Since 1971, Cherbourg-Octeville has belonged to the , presided over by André Rouxel since 2012, Mayor of Tourlaville, to which the municipality delegates urban transport, management of space and the quality of life, the environment and development strategies (higher education, research, major projects, and &quot;Cité de la Mer&quot;, etc.).

The postal codes from prior to the merger of 2000 have been preserved: 50130 for addresses of the former territory of Octeville, 50100 for Cherbourg.

===Political trends and results===
Cherbourg is historically, with the Arsenal and the port, the main focus of labour and trades unions of the department of Manche. However, the Cherbourg workers do not lean towards radical or revolutionary movements, nor to yellow unionism, traditionally preferring the reformist tendencies. These choices are reflected politically into a strong center-left anchor, dominated by Socialist-radicals and independent Socialists, before whom the SFIO and the Socialist Party are not imposed. Since the Liberation, with the exception of a Gaullist period of 18 years with Jacques Hébert following death, the city of Cherbourg has voted in favour Socialist forces.

Similarly, the right won the town hall of Octeville in 1989, for a term, by the division of the left. Since the redrawing of the electoral district of Cherbourg in 1986, covering the urban population of the agglomeration and the rural district of the , the left-right alternation is the rule in every legislative election.

===Others linked to Cherbourg===
The work of the seawall and the military port in Cherbourg led many soldiers and engineers, for whom this step was often an important moment in their career. Thus, Charles François Dumouriez (1739–1823), Governor of Cherbourg who was responsible for the first work, at the dawn of the French Revolution, Joseph Cachin (1757–1825), engineer assigned by Napoleon to the general direction of the maritime work of Cherbourg in 1804. For twenty years, he realised the improvement of the commercial port, and the digging of the docks of the military port, constituting the New Arsenal. Henri Rieunier (1833–1918) who was twice major of the Navy in Cherbourg (1872/1875) and Louis-Émile Bertin (1840–1924) who lived in Cherbourg from 1863 to 1879, and is buried in the cemetery of La Glacerie.

Among the engineers of the Directorate of construction and naval weapons, included Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857) and also Maxime Laubeuf. Under the Ancien Régime, the safeguarding of the Château de Cherbourg was already the task of illustrious figures of the Kingdom, such as , the and ( 1697). At the origin of the military port, Napoleon (1769–1821), who visited the city in 1811, &quot;Revient&quot; in Cherbourg in 1840 during the return of his remains to France, aboard &quot;La Belle Poule&quot;, before being taken to Les Invalides.

A transatlantic port of the 20th century, Cherbourg saw Hollywood stars arrive, such as Charlie Chaplin, who organised his disembarkation in 1952 to a press conference in the &quot;gare maritime&quot;, critical of the McCarthyist America that he left. The port saw a lot of famous people, including businessman Benjamin Guggenheim (1865–1912) for his fatal voyage on the Titanic. Cinema then gave Cherbourg another lasting reputation, through the images of Jacques Demy (1931–1990) and music by Michel Legrand (1932-2019), in &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot;. Earlier, Frida Boccara (1940–1996), knew great success in 1961 with her song &quot;Cherbourg avait raison&quot;. The letters were not left with academician Georges Grente (1872–1959), superior of the Saint-Paul Institute, and Ernest Psichari (1883–1914), soldier and writer, whose garrison stay in Cherbourg in 1914 with the 2nd colonial artillery regiment inspires &quot;L&#x27;Appel des armes&quot;.

==Culture and heritage==
===Cultural facilities===
With Caen, Cherbourg-Octeville is the main cultural centre of Lower Normandy.

The city is the seat of several learned societies, including the founded in 1755, formed in 1851, and the Artistic and Industrial society of Cherbourg, incorporated in 1871.

The creation and dissemination of the performing arts are ensured by the &quot;Trident&quot;, of Italian theatre, the theatre of Octeville and the &quot;Vox&quot;. Amateur theatre is celebrated by &quot;Les Téméraires&quot;.

The &quot;vocation prioritaire du Centre régional des arts du cirque&quot; [Priority Mission of the Regional Centre of Circus Arts] (CRAC) of La Brèche, opened in October 2006, is the residence of circus troops, but instead also offers programming for the public. CRAC participates in the festival of street arts, &quot;Charivarue&quot;.

In addition, the provision of artistic education is rich, with the Film Industry Institute of Normandy, the school of fine arts and the municipal music school, labelled as a conservatory for communal influence, which has 800 registrants.

After the closure of &quot;Ultrasound&quot; in Équeurdreville-Hainneville, a unique room of contemporary music of Nord-Cotentin, several associations have come together within the network &quot;La Voix des oreilles&quot; [&quot;The voice of the ears&quot;] and of the place &quot;Épicentre&quot;, in the former yacht club on &quot;Quai Lawton-Collins&quot;, where the festival &quot;La Terra Trema&quot; takes place.

However, the city lacks a large capacity venue, the theatre can accommodate only 700 spectators. After the bitter failure of &quot;Cherbourg-Land&quot;, this problem has not been resolved at the level of the Cotentin. The Great Hall of the Cité de la Mer, with a space for over 6,000 people, has hosted several concerts, but it is primarily dedicated to the organisation of fairs and exhibitions. Today, the main welcoming complex of large-scale concerts is the Jean-Jaurès Centre of Équeurdreville-Hainneville.

Octeville has retained its patronal festival, the Sainte-Échelle, with holiday fair and parades. Cherbourg restarted its carnival in the 1980s, heir of the , similar to that of Rouen and Évreux.

===Museums===
Cherbourg has several museums.

The former home of Emmanuel Liais, mayor of Cherbourg, astronomer and explorer, houses since 1905 the Museum of Natural History and Ethnography, the oldest museum in Cherbourg (founded in 1832), with curio cabinet, collection of stuffed animals, fossils, minerals and ethnographic objects (Egypt, Asia, Oceania, America and Africa), archaeological treasures and library science. It is also the headquarters of the .

The Thomas-Henry Fine Arts Museum, named after its first patron, was inaugurated in 1835 and is now the third collection of Normandy with 300 paintings and sculptures from the 15th to the 20th century. Located in the cultural centre, at the back of the theatre, it presents paintings by French, Flemish, Spanish and Italian artists, as well as sculptures. Presentations of works by Fra Angelico, Simon Vouet, Camille Claudel, and one of the largest collections of works by Jean-François Millet, as well as paintings by Guillaume Fouace native of Réville or the Navy painters. Sculptures by Armand Le Véel are also included.

The Museum of the War and the Liberation, the first of its kind when it was inaugurated by René Coty on 6 June 1954, traces the daily life of Cherbourg civilians during the Occupation and the course of the Liberation of Cotentin, particularly the Battle of Cherbourg. It is installed in the Fort du Roule, centrepiece of the defence of Cherbourg taken by the Americans on 25 June 1944 .

The Cité de la Mer, is a large museum devoted to scientific and historical aspects of maritime subjects. Dedicated to oceanographic exploration, it is a complex installed since 2003 in a part of the remains of the old transatlantic station. It offers giant aquariums, a collection of underwater vehicles, such as those of COMEX, the bathyscaphe &quot;Archimède&quot; and &quot;Redoutable&quot;, the first French SSBN built in Cherbourg, fully open to the public.

The , a unique contemporary art centre in France, dedicated to photography, was inaugurated in the Bassin zone in November 2008.

===Literature===
The Jacques Prévert Municipal Library, founded in 1831 and opened in 1832, holds the second largest collection in the region, after that of Caen. The purchase of the library of the local scholar Henri-François Duchevreuil, in 1830, complements the 1,855 volumes of the district&#x27;s library, created at 24 &quot;Rue Tour-Carrée&quot;, in application of the decree of the Convention of 8 pluviôse year II and composed essentially of works seized from emigrants and deportees. Several donations were then made, including a legacy of 3,000 works by in 1844 (with twenty-six incunabula and a ninth-century manuscript &quot;De bello iudaico&quot; [The Jewish War] of Flavius Josephus, which remains the oldest document in the library) and a gift in 1877 from Jérôme-Frédéric Bignon, Mayor of Le Rozel and heir to the king&#x27;s librarians. It also has a Norman fonds, an old fonds devoted to botany and another to travel. Housed in a wing of the City Hall in 1855, and then at 9 &quot;Rue Thiers&quot; (&quot;Rue Talluau&quot;) from 1896, the library moved into the cultural centre in June 1981, taking the name of Jacques Prévert, who had died four years earlier in La Hague. The library also participates in the &quot;Normannia&quot; project of the Norman digital library.

The former barracks of the Abbey, dating back to the start of the works of the large dam in 18th-century, has housed one of the five regional centres of history of the National Navy, alongside Brest, Lorient, Rochefort and Toulon, since 1970. The archives of the maritime district of the Channel and the North Sea are grouped here, and the library of the Navy founded in 1836 in Cherbourg and specialising in maritime history with its 23,000 works.

Each year, a network of writing workshops are organised in the metropolitan area, the &quot;Mercurielles&quot;, and the Festival of the Book and of Youth Comic Books (since 1987).

The Biennial of the 9th Art exhibits the works of comic cartoonists (Enki Bilal in 2002, François Schuiten and Benoît Peeters in 2004, André Juillard in 2006, and Loustal in 2008). In 2002, with the support of the City Hall of Cherbourg, Enki Bilal had planned to create a mural in the old &quot;gare maritime&quot; to represent the history of migration in the place; This project was rejected on the basis of an official complaint by , president of the and the Cité de la Mer.

Cherbourg-Octeville is the seat of two publishing houses, &quot;Isoète&quot; founded in 1985 and established in 1996.

===Cinema===
The cinema occupies a significant place in the life of Cherbourg. Many classics of French cinema have been filmed there, such as &quot;La Marie du port&quot; directed by Marcel Carné and starring Jean Gabin. In 1981, Claude Miller also located the action film &quot;Garde à Vue&quot; there, though shot in the studio. However, the most emblematic is undoubtedly &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; directed by Jacques Demy, a story about Madame Emery and her 17-year-old daughter Geneviève (Catherine Deneuve) who sell umbrellas at their tiny boutique. The film was shot in the summer of 1963, and still contributes to the international renown of the city. Yet long before, at the time of the splendor of the transatlantic liners, Cherbourg was a port of arrival, departure or transit for many stars, including Charlie Chaplin and Burt Lancaster. The city was also birthplace of the filmmaker Jean-Charles Tacchella and the actor Jean Marais.

, the Cinemovida (festival of the cinema of Spain and Latin America), and Images d&#x27;Outre-Rhin (German cinema), as well as Cin&#x27;étoiles, screenings of films outdoors in July, animate the local cultural life.

In 2003, the EICAR film school was located in the old buildings of the . After three years of loss and liabilities estimated at €1.5 million, it was placed into liquidation in September 2006 and replaced the following month, under the leadership of elders of its teachers by the Institut des métiers du cinéma de Normandie (IMC Normandie) that itself closed its doors in 2011.

The city has a fleet of 17 permanent cinema rooms, distributed over two sites, including one labelled as &quot;Art et essai&quot; (Revival house).

*Odéon (5 rooms)

Following the opening of the multiplex, the withdrawal of the , which operated &quot;Club 6&quot; (&quot;Rue de la Paix&quot;) since 1983 and the &quot;Odeon&quot; (&quot;Rue Foch&quot;) since 1991, resulted in the closure in 2004 of the first and the revival of the latter city centre cinema, labelled as &quot;Art et essai&quot; by Fadila Chambelland, the former manager. The cinema had 90,000 admissions in 2006.

The damaged façade of the old cafe of the Grand balcon, which then became &quot;Le Central&quot; cinema, is in the style of the Second Empire, with caryatids and garlands of flowers.

The interior frescoes of R. Lecoq, representing Aeolus and Vulcan, were distinguished in 2006 by the label &quot;20th century heritage&quot; of the Ministry of Culture.

Several cinemas have disappeared, such as the &quot;Eldorado&quot; (destroyed, &quot;Place de la Republique&quot;), the &quot;Eden&quot; (&quot;Rue Cachin&quot;), the &quot;Vox&quot; (former patronage room which became a second room of Le Trident (theatre)), and the &quot;Saint-Joseph&quot; (&quot;Rue des Ormes&quot;), etc.

===Language===
The Cherbourg population spoke &quot;le haguais&quot;, a variant of Cotentinais Norman, while having some specifics regarding the pronunciation of certain words.

In Cotentinais Norman, Cherbourg is called &quot;Tchidbouo&quot; and Octeville, &quot;Otteville&quot; . Their inhabitants are the &quot;Tchidbouorqŭais&quot; and the &quot;Ottevillais&quot; and .

While French was necessary in Rouen in the 19th century, Norman remained widely used from Cherbourg to Caen, up to the First World War.

 was the leading local figure of the dialect authors of the 19th century. He published his &quot;Chansonnettes normandes&quot;, among which &quot;Sus la mé&quot; became an anthem of the Cotentin Peninsula. At that time, was critical of its approximate spelling and poor mastery of the language.

Various actors are now trying to promote the local use of the Norman. The Alfred Rossel society makes live folklore and language. &quot;Le Boué-jaun&quot; a Cherbourg-based magazine, published his texts in Norman, and one of three popular Norman universities is based here.

The so-called are small lobsters. Cherbourg is also located near three oyster areas (Blainville, Saint-Vaast and Isigny). The most traditional preparation is the matelote. Alexandre Dumas also presented the recipe of the &quot;queue de merlan à la mode de Cherbourg &quot; [tail of whiting in the Cherbourg manner], with butter and oysters.

From 1464, the bakers of Cherbourg held Royal permission to develop their breads based on seawater, thus avoiding paying for the salt and the &quot;gabelle&quot; [salt tax]. On the occasion of the visit of Napoleon, they would have created folded bread, country bread ball, oval, which is folded back on itself to be cooked, thus offering a tighter bicorn-shaped sandwich which came to be called &quot;pain Napoléon&quot; [Napoleon bread]. Fleury indicated that at the beginning of the 19th century, the principal food of Nord-Cotentin was barley bread, buckwheat porridge and pork-based products, and on feast days, the &quot;galette&quot;, a &quot;type of dough composed of buckwheat flour, milk and eggs, and cooked in a thin film on the tile with butter&quot;, watered, of course, with cider.

The agglomeration is located in the AOC areas of the Pont-l&#x27;Évêque and of the as well as being partially within the Calvados, and the cider of Normandy. It also benefits from the IGP of the cider of Normandy, Normandy pork and . More broadly, the kitchen of Nord-Cotentin is , in which dairy products (butter, cream, milk, cheese, etc.) and apples (as fruit or alcohol) dominate.

A work of in length, the church houses a large organ by Duputel (1885), classified as a historic monument since 1990 and the stained glass windows of 1834, 1858–60 and 1949–58.

The Church of Saint-Clément was built within the quarter of the Val-de-Saire, facing the Pasteur hospital, between June 1853 and 1856 by the architect of the city, Geufroy. long, it is of Greco-Roman inspiration, with a porch in the triangular pediment supported by four columns with Doric capitals. It houses the altars of the Virgin (1863) by François Fréret and Saint-Clément (1864) by Louis-Victor Fréret, acquired from the Basilica of Sainte-Trinité in 1846, an organ (1881), painting of the twelve apostles (1935) the Rock of Césigné and stained glass (1953) of Mauméjean.

The Church of Saint-Pierre and Saint-Paul, on the area of Octeville, was built between 1967 and 1969 while the &quot;grand ensemble&quot; of Provinces was born. The triangular and irregular modern architecture of Paul Vimond symbolises &quot;the tent of God in among the houses of men&quot;, a sacred art inspired by the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965).

==Military life==
During the Middle Ages, Cherbourg, a stronghold of the Cotentin peninsula, was home to a small garrison for the protection of the fortress. With the implementation of the harbour and military port, Cherbourg became a port of war at the end of the 18th century, with a large garrison. In 1798, it had 1,332 men, or a tenth of the population, divided mainly between the barracks of the Abbey, current historical Service of the Navy, which housed 542 men of the 4th brigade and the Maurice Quarter, in the &quot;Hôtel Epron de la Horie&quot;, home to 227 men. Numbers were brought to 3,000 men for the completion of the work, by a decree of germinal year XI.

During the 20th century, Cherbourg, a strategic point during both world wars, adapted to new threats. It then hosted a large garrison of the Navy, an artillery regiment and a &quot;Hôpital des Armées&quot; known locally as &quot;marine hospital&quot;. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the presence of the army weakened by the transfer of the northern fleet to Brest and the closure of the maritime hospital renamed René-Le-Bas.

Yet Cherbourg remained a base of the first order of the National Navy, as the seat of the and of the Maritime Gendarmerie grouping of Manche. The naval base is the homeport of five patrol vessels of the Navy and the coastguard, group of the clearance divers sleeve and its building-base the &quot;Vulcain&quot;, the tug &quot;Abeille Liberté&quot; and various support vessels. It is also the headquarters of the Operational Training of Surveillance and Territorial Information of Cherbourg (Cherbourg FOSIT) which brings together thirteen semaphores and the lookout of the maritime district. In addition, a flotilla 35 F Dauphin helicopter is based at Cherbourg – Maupertus Airport. The operation of the military port is borne by the directions of the Commissioner of the Navy, maritime works and information systems of the Navy, as well as the branch of the support service of the fleet and the military workshop of the Cherbourg fleet.

Cherbourg is also a training hub of the armed forces through the (EAMEA), in charge of the joint education of military specialists in material sciences, of techniques and of nuclear safety and the &quot;École des fourriers de Querqueville&quot;, devoted to education of the officers of the three armed forces in business administration, management, human resources and the restoration to the training of specialists of the restoration of the national gendarmerie and the homes of the Navy staff.

Proposals for reform on the organization and the distribution of the French Army, presented in the spring of 2008 in the White Paper on Defence and National Security planned in the context of the French General Review of Public Policies raise the concern of civilian personnel of the defence of the city, including the . According to projects, Cherbourg-Octeville would become one of 90 defence bases around 2010. In a pooling of means and the establishment of support for the armed forces, the city would retain military and civilian activities, and would host new regiments for the army and of the air force to constitute one of the largest bases of defence. However, the Navy in Cherbourg-Octeville would lose 220 jobs, including civilians, through including the division of half of the staff of the Directorate of maritime works, the abolition of 30 posts including 5 civilians in the &quot;École des fourriers&quot; and the Atomic school, the loss of 27 posts including 14 civilians in the direction of information systems, and the disarmament of the &quot;Vulcain&quot;, &quot;Acharné&quot;, &quot;Coralline&quot; and &quot;Élan&quot;. National orders for DCNS could be spread over several years, also reducing human needs there, especially among the subcontractors.

Several military units were stationed at Cherbourg during the 20th century:

*77th Territorial Infantry Regiment, 1870 - 1914
