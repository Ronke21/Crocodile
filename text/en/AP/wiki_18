<text>Elkhart County is a county located in the U.S. state of Indiana. , the county&#x27;s population was 207,047. The county seat is Goshen. Elkhart County is part of the Elkhart-Goshen Metropolitan Statistical Area, which in turn is part of the South Bend-Elkhart-Mishawaka Combined Statistical Area. It is also considered part of the broader region of Northern Indiana known as Michiana, and is east of South Bend, Indiana, east of Chicago, Illinois, and north of Indianapolis, Indiana. The area is referred to by locals as the recreation vehicle (RV) capital of the world and is known for its sizable Amish and Old Order Mennonite population.

==History==
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the area now within Elkhart County boundaries was mainly inhabited by the Potawatomi tribe. Pioneers began settling in the Elkhart Prairie in 1829 and in April 1830, Elkhart County was officially established with its original county seat in Dunlap. After reorganizing the county borders, the seat was moved to Goshen near the county&#x27;s geographical center.

Elkhart County was founded by immigrants from New England. These were old-stock &quot;Yankee&quot; immigrants, descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s. The completion of the Erie Canal in 1821 sparked a surge in immigration from New England to northern Indiana, which had become a state five years earlier. The end of the Black Hawk War in 1832 increased the immigration surge of immigration, again coming from New England as a result of overpopulation combined with land shortages in that region. Some of these later settlers were from upstate New York, whose relatives had moved to that region from New England shortly after the American Revolutionary War. New Englanders and New England transplants from upstate New York were the vast majority of Elkhart County&#x27;s inhabitants during the first several decades of its history. These settlers were primarily members of the Congregational Church though due to the Second Great Awakening many of them had converted to Methodism and some had become Baptists before moving west. The Congregational Church subsequently has gone through many divisions, and some factions, including those in Elkhart County, are now known as the Church of Christ and the United Church of Christ. As a result of this heritage, most of Elkhart County supported the abolitionist movement before the American Civil War. Elkhart County provided substantial recruits for the Union Army. During the end of the nineteenth century, Irish and German migrants came to Elkhart County, although most did not come directly from Europe, but had stopped in other areas in the Midwest, such as Ohio.

===Name===

The name Elkhart is a euphemization of &quot;Elks-heart&quot;, which refers to the now extinct Eastern elk. The name has been attached to the Elkhart River and surrounding area since at least 1749, when it was recorded in French as (&quot;elk&#x27;s heart&quot;) as the name of a Miami village there. The place name in Miami-Illinois is (&quot;elk&#x27;s heart&quot;). Later in the 18th century the area was inhabited by the Potawatomi; in the Potawatomi language, the place is likewise known as , &quot;at the elk heart&quot;. The name may reflect a prehistoric association of the Elkhart area with the Kaskaskia people, whom the Miami called &quot;elk hearts&quot;.

Other explanations have been suggested. According to an account by two Miami leaders (Jean Baptiste Richardville and Le Gros) recorded in 1824, the name arose from two women fighting over an elk&#x27;s heart that had been hung up to dry. Alternatively, some historians including Jacob Piatt Dunn have associated the name with the shape of an island in the Elkhart River that is stated to resemble an elk&#x27;s heart. This theory has been carried on the city&#x27;s website.

A popular but non-historical account claims that the county was named after a Shawnee Indian chief named &quot;Elkhart&quot;, who was ostensibly a cousin of the famous Chief Tecumseh, and father of &quot;princess Mishawaka&quot; (for whom, according to the story, neighboring Mishawaka is named). This story originated in &quot;Legends of Michigan and the Old North West&quot;, an 1875 collection of historical fiction by Michigan politician Flavius J. Littlejohn.

==Geography==

According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of , of which (or 98.97%) is land and (or 1.03%) is water. The county sits in mostly rural farmland with rolling hills in its northeast corner. Those hills were formed by glaciers and are part of the St. Lawrence Seaway Continental Divide.

The St. Joseph River, which flows from Michigan, across the Michigan border north of Bristol, is the main waterway in Elkhart County. The Elkhart River enters the county east of Millersburg and winds its way through Goshen and Dunlap to Island Park in Elkhart where it meets the St. Joseph. The Little Elkhart River flows into the county southeast of Middlebury and creates some scenic views in Bonneyville Mills County Park before emptying into the St. Joseph near Bristol. Numerous creeks wind their way through the countryside and several lakes, including Simonton Lake, dot the landscape.

Fifteen unincorporated communities also exist in the county. They are Benton, Bonneyville Mills, Dunlap, Foraker, Garden Village, Jimtown, Locke, Midway, New Paris, Nibbyville, Simonton Lake, Southwest, Vistula, and Waterford Mills.

<text>Dubois County is a county located in the U.S. state of Indiana. As of 2020, the population was 43,637. The county seat is Jasper. Dubois County is now the sole county of the Jasper Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Dubois County was formed on December 20, 1818, from Orange, Pike and Perry counties. It is named for Toussaint Dubois, a Frenchman who fought in the American Revolutionary War, the Battle of Tippecanoe and the War of 1812. Dubois was a merchant who lived mainly in Vincennes. He drowned in 1816 while crossing the Little Wabash River near Lawrenceville, Illinois.

In 1818, as many as half of the residents of the county died of milk sickness. The plant contains the potent toxin temetrol, which is passed through the milk. The migrants from the East were unfamiliar with the Midwestern plant and its effects.

Dubois County switched to the Central Time Zone on April 2, 2006, and returned to the Eastern Time Zone on November 4, 2007; both changes were controversial as Huntingburg wished to remain on Central Time while Jasper never wanted to leave Eastern Time.

The original county seat was Portersville. In 1830, the county seat was moved south to Jasper.

<text>Delaware County is a county in the east central portion of the U.S. state of Indiana. As of 2020, the population was 111,903. The county seat is Muncie.

Delaware County is part of the Muncie metropolitan statistical area, which is part of the larger Indianapolis-Carmel-Muncie CSA.

==History==

Delaware County was authorized in Jan. 1820 on New Purchase lands south of the Wabash River gained with the 1818 Treaty of St. Mary&#x27;s. It encompassed the drainage basin of the White River, along which the Delaware, a Native American people had settled, and from which the County takes its name. The Delaware people were moved to lands west of the Mississippi River in the 1840s. The county was once home to Tenskwatawa (&quot;The Prophet&quot;), a brother of Tecumseh who instigated a major Indian uprising in 1811 culminating in the Battle of Tippecanoe. David Conner, a trader, was the first white settler, arriving in the early 1810s. After formation, numerous counties were carved from the original, and a remnant retaining the original name was organized in 1827.

Following the American Civil War the county experienced an economic boom caused by the discovery of natural gas, which spurred rapid industrial growth in the surrounding area.

The first discovery of natural gas in Indiana occurred in 1876 near Eaton. A company was drilling in search of coal, and when they had reaching a depth of six-hundred feet, there was a loud noise and foul-smelling fumes came from the well. After a brief investigation, it was decided they had breached the ceiling of Hell, and the hole was quickly filled in. In 1884, when natural gas was discovered in nearby Ohio, people recalled the incident. They returned to the spot and opened Indiana&#x27;s first natural gas well. The gas was so abundant and strong that when the well was lit, the flames could be seen from Muncie.

==Geography==
Delaware County consists of low rolling prairie, accented by waterways. The Mississinewa River flows westward through the northern part of the county while the White River runs westward through the central part of the county, through Muncie. A large reservoir, Prairie Creek Reservoir, SE of Muncie is managed by the city. The soil is fertile. The county&#x27;s high point is a hilly area in its SE corner, ESE from Prairie Creek Reservoir.

According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of , of which (or 99.04%) is land and (or 0.95%) is water.

<text>Decatur County is a county in the U.S. state of Indiana. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 26,472. The county seat (and only incorporated city) is Greensburg.

==History==
In 1787, the US defined the Northwest Territory which included the area of present-day Indiana. In 1800, Congress separated Ohio from the Northwest Territory, designating the rest of the land as the Indiana Territory. President Thomas Jefferson chose William Henry Harrison as the governor of the territory, and Vincennes was established as the capital. After the Michigan Territory was separated and the Illinois Territory was formed, Indiana was reduced to its current size and geography. By December 1816 the Indiana Territory was admitted to the Union as a state.

Starting in 1794, Native American titles to Indiana lands were extinguished by usurpation, purchase, or war and treaty. The United States acquired land from the Native Americans in the 1809 treaty of Fort Wayne, and by the treaty of St. Mary&#x27;s in 1818 considerably more territory became property of the government. This included the future Decatur County, which was authorized by the state legislature on December 12, 1821. No settler was allowed in the area until the government survey was completed in 1820.

The Decatur County governing structure was formed in 1822. The county was named for Commodore Stephen Decatur Jr., naval officer in the First and Second Barbary Wars, and in the War of 1812. Decatur was killed in a duel in 1820.

==Geography==
The low rolling hills are devoted to agriculture or urban development, with only the areas carved by drainages still wooded. The highest point ( ASL) is a hillock SSE from Kingston.
The Flatrock River flows westward through the upper part of the county, continuing into Shelby County. Clifty Creek flows southwestward through the central part of the county, continuing into Bartholomew, and Sand Creek flows south-southwestward through the lower center of the county, continuing into Jennings County.

<text>Dearborn County is one of 92 counties of the U.S. state of Indiana. Located on the Ohio border near the southeast corner of the state, Dearborn County was formed in 1803 from a portion of Hamilton County, Ohio. In 2020, the population was 50,679. The county seat and largest city is Lawrenceburg.
Dearborn County is part of the Cincinnati, OH-KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

In 1803, following Ohio&#x27;s admission to the Union, a wedge, or pie shaped, remnant of the former Northwest Territory along Ohio&#x27;s southwestern border was ceded to Indiana Territory and organized as Dearborn County. It was named after Henry Dearborn who was U.S. Secretary of War at that time. Lawrenceburg was then designated as the county seat.

All or part of seven other present day counties were carved from the original county with the present boundaries being established in 1845. The region, nicknamed the &quot;Gore&quot;, slices through the present-day counties of Dearborn, Franklin, Ohio, Randolph, Switzerland, Union, Wayne and Fayette. Subdivision of Dearborn County began in 1811 with the formation of Franklin and Wayne Counties, followed by Switzerland in 1814.

Early growth in the region was centered on Lawrenceburg which became an important railroad junction connecting two of the regions major rail lines. A contention existed between the towns of Lawrenceburg and the mostly German-speaking immigrants that dominated Rising Sun over the favored status of Lawrenceburg as the county seat. The rivalry between the two towns was resolved in 1844 when the Indiana State legislature separated the portion of Dearborn County south of Laughery Creek and created the last and smallest Indiana county, county of Ohio on March 1, 1844, with Rising Sun designated as its county seat.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of , of which (or 99.22%) is land and (or 0.77%) is water. Part of the southeastern county line is formed by the Ohio River.

<text>Daviess County is a county in the U.S. state of Indiana. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 33,381. The county seat is Washington. About 15% of the county&#x27;s population is Amish of Swiss origin, as of 2017.

==History==
After the American Revolutionary War was settled, the fledgling nation created the Northwest Territory, tentatively divided into two counties. The area that would become the state of Indiana in 1816 was included in the original Knox County. As the area became more settled, Knox was partitioned into smaller counties, the last of which was the present-day Daviess, authorized on February 2, 1818. The boundaries of Daviess were reduced on December 21, 1818, by the formation of Owen County, and on January 17, 1820, by the formation of Martin County. It has retained its present boundary since 1820.

Daviess County was named for Major Joseph Hamilton Daveiss, U.S. District Attorney for Kentucky, killed at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. The earliest settlements were along the White River, which allowed crops and timber to be transported to distant markets. The northeast part of the county was heavily forested, and timber industry flourished in the first half of the nineteenth century. Daviess County shares its namesake with another nearby Daviess County of Kentucky. Both Counties are in the Illinois-Indiana-Kentucky Tri-State Area.

==Geography==
The terrain of Daviess County is hilly, with its area completely devoted to agriculture or urban development. Its highest elevation ( ASL) is a rise NNE of Farlen. The county is drained by the White River flowing to the southwest, whose two main forks (East White and West White) come together at the county&#x27;s SW corner. The county&#x27;s west boundary is defined by the West White River&#x27;s course and its south boundary is defined by the East White River&#x27;s course; their confluence defines the county&#x27;s corner point.

According to the 2010 census, Daviess County has a total area of , of which (or 98.31%) is land and (or 1.69%) is water.

==Government==

The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the Constitution of Indiana, and by the Indiana Code. The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.

A board of commissioners constitutes the county&#x27;s executive body. Commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered four-year terms. One commissioner serves as president. The board executes the council&#x27;s legislative acts, collects revenue, and manages the county&#x27;s government functions.

The county maintains a small claims court that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.

The county has other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare party affiliations and to be residents of the county.

Each township has a trustee who administers rural fire protection and ambulance service, provides poor relief, manages cemetery care, and performs farm assessment, among other duties. The trustee is assisted in these duties by a three-member township board. The trustees and board members are elected to four-year terms.

Daviess County is part of Indiana&#x27;s 8th congressional district; Indiana Senate districts 39 and 48; and Indiana House of Representatives districts 45, 63 and 64.

===Political culture===












Daviess County is a Republican stronghold in presidential elections and is consistently one of the most Republican counties in Indiana, giving John McCain 67% of the vote in 2008 and Mitt Romney nearly 75% of the vote in 2012. Donald Trump nearly won 80% of the vote in 2020.

==History==

Crawford County was formed on January 5, 1818, from land in the Harrison, Orange, and Perry counties, prompted by a petition of what would become of Crawford County&#x27;s population. Some say it was named for William H. Crawford, who was U.S. Treasury Secretary in 1818. Others say it was named for Col. William Crawford, who fought in the French and Indian War and Revolutionary War, and who was burned and scalped by Indians in 1782 in what is now Wyandot County, Ohio. The county seat was in Leavenworth for several decades but eventually moved to English.

Bands of &quot;White Caps&quot; terrorized the county in the late 1880s, according to a report by Attorney General Louis T. Michener. Blacks and others they disliked were forced out; victims, both male and female, were severely whipped.

== Climate and weather ==

County Council: The county council is the fiscal branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.

Board of Commissioners: The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.

Court: The county maintains a small claims court that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.

County Officials: The county has several other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government.

<text>Clark County is a county in the U.S. state of Indiana, located directly across the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky. At the 2020 census, the population was 121,093. The county seat is Jeffersonville. Clark County is part of the Louisville/Jefferson County, KY–IN Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Clark County lies on the north bank of the Ohio River. A significant gateway to the state of Indiana, Clark County&#x27;s settlement began in 1783. The state of Virginia rewarded General George Rogers Clark and his regiment for their victorious capture of Forts Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Vincennes from the British, by granting them of land. A small portion of this land, , became known as Clarksville, the first authorized American settlement in the Northwest Territory, founded the next year in 1784.

Clark County was formed on February 3, 1801, with territory annexed from Knox, the first county formed in the Territory in 1790. This original area in Clark County was subsequently altered and reduced with the formation of other counties: Harrison (1808), Franklin, Jefferson, and Wayne (1811), Switzerland and Washington (1814), Jackson and Ripley (1816), Jennings (1817), Crawford and Randolph (1818), Fayette and Floyd (1819), Scott (1820), Union (1821), Decatur and Rush (1822).

The first county seat was established in Springville, on April 7, 1801. Jeffersonville was platted in 1802, and on June 9 the Territorial Governor (William Henry Harrison) ordered that it be regarded as the county seat. However, on December 14, 1810, the seat designation was given to Charlestown, which retained the designation until 1873, when on September 23 the Jefforsonville mayor (Luther Warder) successfully campaigned for the county seat&#x27;s return.

Clark County was a hotbed for antislavery sentiment during the territorial period. In 1807, citizens petitioned Congress to uphold the legal prohibition of slavery established in the Northwest Ordinance in response to efforts by Harrison and his supporters to have the prohibition repealed. Many settlers were Quakers who had migrated from North Carolina to escape the oppressive conditions of the slave states and did not want to see slavery be established in Indiana.

From its beginning Clark County&#x27;s history, culture and growth have been linked to the development of the river. Early nineteenth-century steamboats transported goods to the upper Ohio, providing opportunities for commercial and industrial growth in the county. In 1832, James Howard founded the Howard shipyards making Clark County a leader in shipbuilding.

The railroad brought further economic growth. The Monon line spanned from New Albany to Chicago, and the Jeffersonville, Madison, and Indianapolis Railroad provided Clark County and southern Indiana with access to the northern trading centers of Indianapolis and Chicago.

Industries locating to Clark County during the nineteenth century included the Louisville Cement Company in Speed, Indiana and the Ford Plate Glass Company established in Jeffersonville in 1876.

During the 1920s, Clark County attracted the Colgate-Palmolive Company to the Clarksville Riverfront. Colgate purchased the former Indiana Reformatory building in 1923. The company rehabilitated and adapted the building for its dedication in 1924. It stayed in business until early 2008.

During World War II the county prospered. The federal government began the Indiana Arsenal near Charlestown in 1940. Producing smokeless powder for the war effort, the arsenal employed up to 20,000. Howard shipyards was commissioned by the Navy to produce landing craft. Later Howard shipyards reorganized as Jeffersonville Boat and Machine Company (Jeffboat) — a current major employer (1991).

When the war ended, the county experienced significant residential and commercial growth, aided by the 1956 Interstate Act. The improved access provided by Interstate 65 encouraged additional subdivisions and shopping centers.
Clark County history has been closely associated with the development of the Ohio River. From its beginnings, Clark County relied on the river for economic opportunities. Clark County has diversified its economic base, lessened its dependency on the river, and continues to develop in new directions. However, the county still looks to the river as one link to its significant pioneer heritage.

==Geography==
Clark County lies on the east edge of Indiana; its eastern border abuts the northern border of the state of Kentucky (across the Ohio River). The terrain is low rolling hills, with the area either devoted to agriculture or urban development. The west part of the county is carved with drainages. The highest point on the terrain is a ridge WNW of Henryville near the border with Scott County, at ASL.

According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of , of which (or 99.05%) is land and (or 0.96%) is water.

==Government==
For most of its history, Clark County was a Democratic-leaning county, its politics more in line with neighboring Kentucky than Indiana. However, the county voted for the national winner in all but 2 elections from 1924 to 2004 (1952, 1968). Since the start of the second millennium, the county has trended strongly Republican, moving away from its previous near-bellwether status.
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the Constitution of Indiana, and by the Indiana Code.

County Council

The seven-member county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Four representatives are elected from county districts, and three are elected at large. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.

Board of Commissioners

The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.

Courts

The Clark County Judicial System consists of 8 Courts:
* Clark Circuit Court (Judge Daniel Moore)
* Clark Superior Court #1 (Judge Vicki Carmichael)
* Clark Superior Court #2 (Judge Jerome Jacobi)
* Clark Superior Court #3 (Judge Joe P. Weber)
* Jeffersonville City Court – Office Expired December 31, 2015
* Charlestown City Court (Judge George Waters)
* Clarksville Town Court (Judge Samuel Gwin)
* Sellersburg Town Court (Judge Thomas Lowe)

By statute, the Circuit and Superior Courts have unlimited jurisdiction with the power to hear civil and criminal cases. City and Town Courts have jurisdiction to hear Ordinance violations and misdemeanor prosecutions, as well as civil actions where the amount in controversy does not exceed five hundred dollars ($500). Judgments in the City and Town Courts may be appealed de novo to the Clark Circuit Court. In addition, Clark Superior Court #3 maintains a Small Claims Docket. Local Rules of Practice may also limit the ability of a Court to hear certain cases. Judgments in other Courts may be appealed to the Indiana Court of appeals or the Indiana Supreme Court.

The Circuit and Superior Court Judges are assisted by 3 Magistrates, who are appointed and serve at the direction of the elected Judges.

The Circuit and Superior Court Judges are elected on a partisan basis, must reside within the county, and serve six-year terms. The City and Town Court Judges are elected to four-year terms on a partisan basis, and must reside within the City/Town.

Felony and Misdemeanor prosecutions are filed by the Prosecuting Attorney, who is elected on a partisan basis, must reside within the county, and serves a term of four years. The current Prosecuting Attorney, Steven D. Stewart, has been in Office since 1989.

County officials

The county has several other elected offices, including prosecuting attorney, sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk. These officers are elected to four-year terms. Members elected to county government positions must declare a party affiliation and be residents of the county.

<text>Carroll County is a county located in the U.S. state of Indiana. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 20,306. The county seat is Delphi. Carroll County is part of the Lafayette, Indiana, Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
In 1787, the fledgling United States defined the Northwest Territory, which included the area of present-day Indiana. In 1800, Congress separated Ohio from the Northwest Territory, designating the rest of the land as the Indiana Territory. President Thomas Jefferson chose William Henry Harrison as the territory&#x27;s first governor, and Vincennes was established as the territorial capital. After the Michigan Territory was separated and the Illinois Territory was formed, Indiana was reduced to its current size and geography. By December 1816, the Indiana Territory was admitted to the Union as a state.

Starting in 1794, Native American titles to Indiana lands were extinguished by usurpation, purchase, or war and treaty. The United States acquired land from the Native Americans in the treaty of St. Mary&#x27;s in 1818, which included most of the future county, and in 1826 the Treaty of Mississinewas made more area available for settlement. These two treaties resolved the occupation issue for the future Carroll County.

White people had been living in the future Carroll County area since 1824 and their numbers increased rapidly in the next few years. Accordingly, Carroll County was authorized by the state legislature on January 17, 1828; it was named for Charles Carroll, the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence, who died in 1832. The first commissioners began organizing the county government on April 28 of that year and determined to site the county seat at land donated by William Wilson. The name &#x27;Carrollton&#x27; was first suggested for the new community, but at the suggestion of General Samuel Milroy, &#x27;Delphi&#x27; was selected instead.

The Wabash and Erie Canal, built through the county in 1840 and operating until the early 1870s, is among the county&#x27;s most significant historical legacies.

===Courthouse===
The first county courthouse was built in 1831. It was replaced by a brick structure in 1856. The 730-pound bell from the first courthouse was made in Cincinnati in 1836 and given by Sheriff Samuel Davis Gresham and was used in the second courthouse until 1916. While the bell was in transit to Lafayette by boat, the boat sank. The bell was recovered from the Ohio River, and was sold, but was returned to Carroll County in 1967.

The current Carroll County courthouse was designed by Jaxson Cowell of Indianapolis, who also designed the Spencer County courthouse. It was constructed by A. E. Kemmer at a cost of about $250,000 from 1916 to 1917. The exterior is understated, but the interior is surprisingly elaborate, including a stained glass dome over a mosaic tile floor.

==Geography==
The Wabash River flows southwestward from Cass County through the upper part of Carroll County, exiting into Tippecanoe County. The Tippecanoe River flows southward through the county&#x27;s upper west edge, also exiting into Tippecanoe County, where it merges with the Wabash shortly after leaving Carroll County&#x27;s border. Wildcat Creek drains the south part of Carroll County, flowing westward into Tippecanoe to merge with the Wabash there.

The terrain of Carroll County was heavily wooded at the start, but now the flat areas are cleared and devoted to agriculture or urban development, with only the drainage areas still wooded. The highest point on the terrain ( ASL) is the county&#x27;s SE corner.

According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of , of which (or 99.25%) is land and (or 0.75%) is water.

==Government==

The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the Constitution of Indiana, and by the Indiana Code.

County Council: The legislative branch of the county government; controls spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected to four-year terms from county districts. They set salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.

Board of Commissioners: The executive body of the county; commissioners are elected county-wide to staggered four-year terms. One commissioner serves as president. The commissioners execute acts legislated by the council, collect revenue, and manage the county government.

Court: The county maintains a small claims court that handles civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.

County Officials: The county has other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk. These officers are elected to four-year terms. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare a party affiliation and to be residents of the county.

Carroll County is part of Indiana&#x27;s 4th congressional district and is represented by Jim Baird in the United States Congress. It is also part of Indiana Senate district 7 and Indiana House of Representatives district 24.

<text>Brown County is a county in Indiana which in 2020 had a population of 15,475. The county seat (and only incorporated town) is Nashville.

==History==


The United States acquired the land from the Native Americans, part of which forms the southwest section of what is now Brown County, in the 1809 treaty of Fort Wayne. By the treaty of St. Mary&#x27;s in 1818 considerably more territory became property of the government and this included the future Brown County area. No settler was allowed in the area until the government survey was completed in 1820. The first white man known to arrive was a German, Johann Schoonover, who lived for a short time on the creek later named for him to trade with the Native Americans, about 1820. In that same year William Elkins, the first pioneer, built a log cabin and cleared land in the area. In the 1850s Elkins was recorded as having settled in the future Van Buren Township, and the settlement that grew up around him was known as Elkinsville.

The earliest pioneers came from Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and the Carolinas. They crossed the Ohio River and traveled north on narrow Indian trails through dense hardwood forest with wagons drawn by oxen. Many made their way to Bloomington, then east to hilly country, or they reached Jackson County and came north into future Brown County on the Sparks Ferry Road, or west from Columbus in Bartholomew County. Pioneers who had settled on lowland near Columbus came to the hills to escape malaria. Others deliberately chose the hills having lived in mountains before they made the trip to Indiana in search of new land. By 1830 an estimated 150 settlers had arrived; the United States census of 1840 reported 2,364 people. 

By 1828 the Indiana State Legislature had divided the land of present-day Brown County between Monroe, Jackson, and Bartholomew counties. In 1835 settlers presented a petition to the Legislature requesting a new county. On February 4, 1836, both the House and Senate passed a bill providing for the formation from western Bartholomew, eastern Monroe, and northern Jackson counties of a county to be named for Gen. Jacob Brown, who defeated the British at the Battle of Sackett&#x27;s Harbor in the War of 1812. The county covers a nominal , measuring a surveyed from east to west and from north to south.

In August 1836, the land was divided into five townships of Jackson, Hamblen, Washington, Johnson, and Van Buren. Nashville, then known as Jacksonburg, was chosen as the county seat. Banner C. Brummett was appointed County Agent to lay out Nashville in lots to be sold at auction. It was expected that money from the sale would help pay expenses of the county government. The lots sold very slowly, for pioneers had little money, and funds were short for a number of years. In 1837 a log court house and jail were built. They were built on the same lots on which the present court house and log jail stand. Nashville, at that time, consisted of a cluster of log cabins and 75 people.

The country was wild in 1836; bears, panthers, and wolves were plentiful. The wolves were so numerous that the Commissioners paid $1 for every wolf pelt brought to them. Settlers lived a rugged pioneer type of life for many years. Their cabins and small settlements were mere niches in the great forest that covered hills and valleys.

By the time Nashville was incorporated in 1872, water-powered grist mills and sawmills were scattered over the county. Each village served its own locality with at least one general store, a blacksmith shop, a church and a post office. A doctor, sometimes more than one, lived in almost every village. In 1881 there were 20 doctors in the county, and 37 churches - Methodist, United Brethren, Baptist, Presbyterian, and New Light. There were many immigrants in Brown County at this time, including immigrants from England, Wales, Germany, and elsewhere. Two of the Presbyterian churches in the county had congregations that consisted entirely of Presbyterians of Scottish descent who came to America from County Down and County Antrim in the northeastern part of Ireland, in what has since become Northern Ireland. These immigrants were referred to by the rest of the community as being &quot;Scots-Irish&quot;, however they referred to themselves as &quot;Ulstermen&quot; and &quot;Irish Presbyterians.&quot; Money continued to be scarce and much business was conducted by the barter system. The first schools were built of logs, but by 1872 one-room frame school houses dotted the county; in 1900 there were 73.

People farmed but they depended on forest products for cash. Lumber was taken to Indianapolis, also tan bark, cross ties, hoop poles, and barrel staves. The trees were cut recklessly and this led to deep trouble. Since there was not enough farmland on the ridge tops and in the creek bottoms, trees were eliminated on the sides of hills. Wheat and other crops were planted, and erosion became a significant problem. By 1900, soil was so completely washed from hillsides and creek bottoms that crops could not be grown. Poverty was widespread and people began to leave the county in droves. Cabins all over the hills and valleys stood empty. In 1890, 10,308 people lived in Brown County. By 1930 only 5,168 remained. Not until 1980 did the population exceed the 1890 figure.

In 1900, villages were still the centers of Brown County life. Travel by horseback, wagon, or carriage was exceedingly limited due to deeply rutted, rocky roads. There were people in remote areas who never made a trip to Nashville during their lives. Many a family&#x27;s only contact with the outside world was a salesman&#x27;s weekly visit with his horse and wagon. As a result, the pioneer way of life continued long after other counties had adopted a new pattern of living.

In 1905 the Illinois Central Railroad built a line from Indianapolis to Effingham, Illinois. The line ran from Morgantown across the southwest corner of Jackson Township. Helmsburg was the main station. Two trains a day from Indianapolis, and two from Effingham, brought freight, mail, and passengers. Horse drawn hacks took people and wagons transported mail and freight from the station to Nashville.

The first cars appeared in Nashville in 1913. Their use was strictly limited because of the poor roads and because of the widespread belief, peculiar to Brown County, that cars were both autonomous and maleficent. By necessity as the number of cars increased, county roads were gradually improved. By 1934 State Road 135 north from Nashville to Morgantown had been built and in that year was hard surfaced. State Road 46 between Bloomington and Nashville was worked on extensively until it was considered one of the best gravel roads in the state. Some years later it was hard surfaced.

In 1907, artist T. C. Steele built a studio near Belmont in rural Brown County and Adolph Shulz came to Nashville and thus began the Brown County Art Colony. Will Vawter, V.J. Cariani, Marie Goth, C. Curry Bohn, Dale Bessire and others moved to Nashville. The Brown County Art Gallery was opened in 1926. In 1954 a larger gallery was built on East Main Street, and an Art Guild established a gallery in the old Minor House on Van Buren Street. Nashville continues to be an art center and tourist attraction.

Brown County State Park opened in 1931 offering many advantages: a lodge, cabins for rent, picnic areas, a swimming pool, and miles of trails. And at present there is Yellowwood State Forest, the Hoosier National Forest, Lake Monroe and Lake Lemon.

==Geography==
Unlike much of Indiana with its low rolling hills, the terrain of Brown County is rugged and hilly, with the drainage areas filled with brush, undergrowth, or trees. The county&#x27;s highest point ( ASL) is Weed Patch Hill, the third-highest prominence in the state.

According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of , of which (or 98.53%) is land and (or 1.47%) is water. Brown County is tied with Benton County as the least densely populated county in Indiana. Brown County has by far the highest concentration of forested land of any of Indiana&#x27;s 92 counties with nearly 90% coverage and almost no large farms at all.

==Government==

The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the Constitution of Indiana, and by the Indiana Code.

County Council: The legislative branch of the county government; controls spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected to four-year terms from county districts. They set salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.

Board of Commissioners: The executive body of the county. Commissioners are elected county-wide to staggered four-year terms. One commissioner serves as president. The commissioners execute acts legislated by the council, collect revenue, and manage the county government.

Court: The county maintains a circuit court with jurisdiction to hear civil and criminal cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of six years and must be an attorney licensed to practice in Indiana. The judge is assisted by a magistrate who is hired by the circuit court judge, not elected.

County Officials: The county has other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk. These officers are elected to four-year terms.

Brown County is part of Indiana&#x27;s 9th congressional district, Indiana Senate district 40 and Indiana House of Representatives districts 60 and 65.

<text>Boone County is a county in the U.S. state of Indiana. As of 2020, the population was 70,812. The county seat is Lebanon.

==History==
In 1787, the fledgling United States defined the Northwest Territory, which included the area of present-day Indiana. In 1800, Congress separated Ohio from the Northwest Territory, designating the rest of the land as the Indiana Territory. President Thomas Jefferson chose William Henry Harrison as the territory&#x27;s first governor, and Vincennes was established as the territorial capital. After the Michigan Territory was separated and the Illinois Territory was formed, Indiana was reduced to its current size and geography. By December 1816 the Indiana Territory was admitted to the Union as a state.

Starting in 1794, Native American titles to Indiana lands were extinguished by usurpation, purchase, or war and treaty. The United States acquired land from the Native Americans in the 1809 treaty of Fort Wayne, and by the treaty of St. Mary&#x27;s in 1818 considerably more territory became property of the government. This included the future Boone County, designating areas covered by the Delaware New Purchase.

Boone County was created by the state legislature on April 1, 1830, with Jamestown (which had been first settled that year) named as the initial county seat. The county was named for frontiersman Daniel Boone. The interim county commissioners met on May 1 of the following year to identify a permanent seat of government, which by law had to be within of the county&#x27;s center; the [future] city of Lebanon was selected to serve this purpose.

==Geography==
Boone County lies near the center of the state. It is from east to west and from north to south. It contains about 418.5 square miles (108,500 hectares), two-thirds of which is in cultivation. Its central position, excellent soil, and available water power have been in its favor. The highest point of the county ( ASL) is a small hill northeast of Lebanon.
The upper part of the county is drained by Sugar Creek, flowing westward into Montgomery County; the southwest part of the county is drained by Big Raccoon Creek, also flowing west-southwestward into Montgomery. The southeast part of the county is drained by Eagle Creek and its tributaries, flowing southward into Marion County.

According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of , of which (or 99.92%) is land and (or 0.08%) is water.

The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.

County Officials: The county has other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk. They are elected to four-year terms. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare a party affiliation and to be residents of the county.

<doc id="96144" wikidata="Q505272" url="?curid=96144" title="Blackford County, Indiana">
<text>Blackford County is located in the east central portion of the U.S. state of Indiana. The county is named for Judge Isaac Blackford, who was the first speaker of the Indiana General Assembly and a long-time chief justice of the Indiana Supreme Court. Created in 1838, Blackford County is divided into four townships, and its county seat is Hartford City. Two incorporated cities and one incorporated town are located within the county. The county is also the site of numerous unincorporated communities and ghost towns. Occupying only , Blackford County is the fourth smallest county in Indiana. As of the 2020 census, the county&#x27;s population was 12,112. Based on population, the county is the 8th smallest county of the 92 in Indiana. Although no interstate highways are located in Blackford County, three Indiana state roads cross the county, and an additional state road is located along the county&#x27;s southeast border. The county has two railroad lines. A north–south route crosses the county, and intersects with a second railroad line that connects Hartford City with communities to the west.

Before the arrival of European-American settlers during the 1830s, the northeastern portion of the future Blackford County was briefly the site of an Indian reservation for Chief Francois Godfroy of the Miami tribe. The first European-American pioneers were typically farmers who settled on arable land near rivers. Originally, the county was mostly swampland, but more land became available for farming as the marshes were cleared and drained. Over the next 30 years, small communities developed throughout the county. When the county&#x27;s rail lines were constructed in the 1860s and 1870s, additional communities evolved around railroad stops.

Beginning in the late 1880s, the discovery of natural gas and crude oil in the county (and surrounding region) caused the area to undergo an economic boom period known as the Indiana Gas Boom. Manufacturers relocated to the area to take advantage of the low-cost energy and railroad facilities. The boom period lasted about 15 years, and is reflected in Blackford County&#x27;s population, which peaked in 1900 at 17,213. The construction associated with the additional prosperity of the boom period caused a significant upgrade in the county&#x27;s appearance, as wooden buildings were replaced with masonry structures. Much of the infrastructure built during that time remains today—including Montpelier&#x27;s historic Carnegie Library and many of Hartford City&#x27;s buildings in the Courthouse Square Historic District.

Agriculture continues to be important to the county, and became even more important after the loss of several large manufacturers during the 20th century. As of 2010, 72 percent of Blackford County is covered by either corn or soybean fields; additional crops, such as wheat and hay, are also grown.

==History==
Following thousands of years of varying cultures of indigenous peoples, the historic Miami and Delaware Indians (a.k.a. Lenape) are the first-recorded permanent settlers in the Blackford County area, living on the Godfroy Reserve after an 1818 treaty. The site is located in Blackford County&#x27;s Harrison Township, east of Montpelier. Although the Godfroy Reserve was allotted to Miami Native Chief Francois (a.k.a. Francis) Godfroy, Delaware Indians were also allowed to stay there. The Miami tribe was the most powerful group of Natives in the region, and Francois Godfroy (who was half French) was one of their chiefs. By 1839, Godfroy had sold the reserve, and the Natives had migrated west. Benjamin Reasoner was the first European–American to enter future Blackford County, and its first land owner. He entered the area on July 9, 1831. Reasoner and his sons built the county&#x27;s first mill, on their farm.

The land that would become Blackford County was originally the western part of Jay County. A January 30, 1836, act of the Indiana General Assembly created Jay County, effective March 1, 1836. In December 1836, a motion was made in the Indiana House of Representatives to review dividing Jay County, but that resolution was not adopted.
Two Blackford County communities, Matamoras and Montpelier, originally existed as part of Jay County. They lie along the Salamonie River in what became the northeast portion of Blackford County. John Blount founded Matamoras, arriving in 1833. This village is Blackford County&#x27;s oldest community, and is the site of the county&#x27;s largest water mill. The mill, constructed around 1843, was considered one of the finest in the state. Blackford County&#x27;s other former Jay County community is Montpelier, west of Matamoras on the Salamonie River. Led by Abel Baldwin, the community was started in 1836 by groups of migrant settlers from Vermont. They named the settlement after the capital of their previous home state. Blackford County&#x27;s Montpelier was platted in 1837 (before Matamoras), and is the county&#x27;s oldest platted community.

Several sources list the creation year for Blackford County as 1837. However, the law was not finalized until 1838. Indiana bill of the House No. 152 was originally for the creation of a county named Windsor. The name &quot;Windsor&quot; was replaced with the name &quot;Blackford&quot; by the House of Representatives in January 1838. An &quot;act for the formation of the county of Blackford&quot; was approved on February 15, 1838. This act intended that the county would be &quot;open for business&quot; on the first Monday in April 1838, which was April 2. However, the county was not organized. Finally, on January 29, 1839, the original February 15 act was amended, stating that Blackford County shall &quot;enjoy the rights and privileges&quot; of an independent county. The act also appointed commissioners, and corrected a misprint that defined the southeast corner of the new county.

Over the next two years, a political struggle continued to determine the location of the county seat. The tiny community of Hartford was repeatedly selected by the commissioners, but those decisions were challenged by individuals favoring Montpelier. While Licking Township (where Hartford lay) was the most populous township in the county, Montpelier was the county&#x27;s oldest platted community. After a third and fourth act of the Indiana General Assembly, Hartford was finalized as the location of the county seat—and construction of a courthouse began. When it was noted that another Indiana community was also named Hartford, Blackford County&#x27;s Hartford was renamed Hartford City.

During the next 25 years, the county grew slowly. Plans were made for roads and railroads, and swampland was drained. The first railroad line was authorized in 1849. The plan was for the Fort Wayne &amp; Southern Railroad Company to connect the Indiana cities of Fort Wayne and Muncie—running north–south through the Blackford County communities of Montpelier and Hartford City. Although construction began in the 1850s, it was not completed (by connecting Fort Wayne to Muncie) until 1870, and this delay caused it to be the second railroad to operate in Blackford County. By the time the railroad began operations, it was named Fort Wayne, Cincinnati &amp; Louisville Railroad. The Lake Erie and Western Railroad acquired this railroad in 1890.

The first railroad to operate in Blackford County crossed somewhat east–west through the county&#x27;s southern half. The railroad was named Union and Logansport Railroad Company by the time it entered Blackford County. This line was proposed in 1862, and completed to Hartford City in 1867—running through the Blackford County communities of Dunkirk, Crumley&#x27;s Crossing, and Hartford City. The small community of Crumley&#x27;s Crossing was renamed Converse, and two other communities (Millgrove and Renner) became established on this line. The railroad was eventually named Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railroad. Other names for the railroad since that time include the Panhandle division of the Pennsylvania Railroad, Penn Central Transportation Company, Conrail, and Norfolk Southern Railway. A portion of this line is now abandoned, and the track has been removed between Converse and Hartford City, south of State Road 26.

===Gas boom===

In 1886, natural gas was discovered in two counties adjacent to Blackford County. The discoveries were in the small community of Eaton (south of Hartford City along railroad line) in Delaware County, and in the city of Portland in Jay County (east of Hartford City and Millgrove). The Hartford City Gas &amp; Oil Company was formed in early 1887, and successfully drilled a natural gas well later in the year. The Montpelier Gas &amp; Oil Mining company was organized in 1887. While natural gas was found throughout Blackford County, crude oil was found mostly in the county&#x27;s Harrison Township (between Montpelier and Mollie). Blackford County&#x27;s first successful oil well, located south of Montpelier, began producing in 1890. Montpelier was thought to be &quot;the very heart of the greatest natural gas and oil field in the world&quot;. Oil was also found in parts of Washington Township, including a well that was thought to be &quot;the most phenomenal well ever drilled in America&quot;. By 1896, Blackford County had 18 natural gas companies, headquartered in all four of the county&#x27;s townships, including the communities of Hartford City, Montpelier, Roll, Dunkirk, Trenton (Priam Post Office), and Millgrove.

In June 1880, only 171 people held manufacturing jobs in Blackford County. The Indiana Gas Boom transformed the region, as manufacturers moved to the area to utilize the natural gas and railroad system. During 1901, Indiana state inspectors visited 21 manufacturing facilities in Blackford County, and these companies employed 1,346 people (compare to 171 two decades earlier). Since these inspections were in Hartford City and Montpelier only, additional manufacturing employees from the county&#x27;s small communities (such as Millgrove&#x27;s glass factory) could be added to the count of 1,346. The county&#x27;s two largest employers were glass factories: American Window Glass plant number 3 and Sneath Glass Company. Hartford City&#x27;s resources (low–cost energy, two railroads, and skilled workforce) were especially favored by glass factories, and a 1904 directory lists 10 of them.
In addition to an economic transformation, another byproduct of the gas boom was an upgrade of Blackford County&#x27;s appearance. Many of the county&#x27;s landmark buildings were constructed during the gas boom, including the current courthouse and surrounding buildings in Hartford City&#x27;s Courthouse Square Historic District. The city&#x27;s water supply system was also built during that period. Additional buildings include the Carnegie Library, and the historic Presbyterian Church. Many of Montpelier&#x27;s Downtown Historic District structures were built during the gas boom. Montpelier&#x27;s historic Baptist Church and Montpelier&#x27;s Carnegie Library were constructed in the early 1900s – near the end of the gas boom.

===Post-gas boom===
The Indiana Gas Boom ended during the first decade of the 20th century, reducing the county&#x27;s economy. Gas and oil workers left, some manufacturers moved, and service industries were forced to cut back operations. Adding to the county&#x27;s problems, machines made the labor–intensive method originally used for producing window glass obsolete, causing many of the county&#x27;s skilled glass workers at the large American Window Glass plant to lose their jobs. By 1932, the window glass plant of the county&#x27;s former largest employer was closed. According to the United States Census, Blackford County&#x27;s population peaked at 17,123 in 1900, and it still has not returned to that zenith over 100 years later.

The end of the gas boom was especially difficult for the smaller communities in the county, since the loss of a single business has more of an impact on small communities. In the case of Millgrove, the community&#x27;s major manufacturer (a glass factory) closed. For other communities, such as Mollie, the loss of the gas and oil workers meant that the local post office was a &quot;waste of time&quot;, and consumer demand at the general store was significantly diminished.

Improvements to the automobile and highways, which coincided with the end of the gas boom, also contributed to the decline of the county&#x27;s smaller communities. The automobile changed &quot;business and shopping patterns at the expense of the small-town merchant&quot;. Small–town residents began to drive to larger communities to purchase goods, because of the wider selection. The improved quality of automobiles and roads competed with passenger service on the railroads (and interurban lines), causing a decline in passenger traffic on the rails. Small towns associated with railroad stations suffered from the loss in traffic. In Blackford County, passenger service on the Lake Erie and Western Railroad line (owned by the Nickel Plate Road by that time) was discontinued in 1931, and the last interurban train ran on January 18, 1941.

Although many workers left the area after the gas and oil bust, Montpelier&#x27;s population eventually stabilized—and Hartford City&#x27;s grew. Some manufacturers remained because of a lack of better alternatives. Hartford City&#x27;s Sneath Glass Company, a major employer, continued operations until the 1950s. Hartford City leaders attracted businesses such as Overhead Door (1923) and 3M (1955) to replace the former companies. Overhead Door was a major employer in Hartford City for over 60 years. In the 1960s, Overhead Door moved its headquarters from Hartford City to Dallas, Texas, although its Hartford City manufacturing plant continued until the 1980s as a major manufacturer, when it began reducing its local presence. It ceased the Indiana operation in 2000. The county lost another 200 jobs in 2011 when Hartford City&#x27;s Key Plastics plant closed.

Agriculture continues to be an important factor in the county&#x27;s economy. Over 70 percent of Blackford County&#x27;s land is occupied by soybean or corn fields. Additional crops and livestock are also raised. Good returns in agriculture are not always reflected in the economy of nearby towns, as industrial agriculture has reduced the number of workers it needs, and family farms have declined. Many small towns in the &quot;Corn Belt&quot;, such as the communities in Blackford County, continue to decline in size and affluence.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Blackford County has a total area of , of which (or 99.70%) is land and (or 0.30%) is water, making it the fourth smallest county in the state. The county is located in East Central Indiana, about south of Fort Wayne, Indiana, and about northeast of Indianapolis.

===Adjacent counties===
* Wells County (north)
* Jay County (east)
* Delaware County (south)
* Grant County (west)

The terrain of Blackford County shows the influence of glacial passage in the distant past. These glaciers were responsible for the rich farmland that became available after the county was cleared and drained. During the early 20th century, the Renner Stock Farm, in Licking Township, was known statewide for its quality cattle, hogs, and horses.

===Waterways===
The county has some small streams, and several man-made lakes. The Salamonie River, flowing out of Jay County (Indiana) from the east, crosses the northeast corner of Blackford County. Big and Little Lick Creek flow westward in Licking and Jackson townships in the southern half of the county. Early settlers were attracted to Lick Creek, and then the Salamonie River, because the nearby land had suitable drainage for farming. The county&#x27;s lakes include Lake Blue Water in Harrison Township; Cain&#x27;s Lake, Shamrock Lakes and Lake Mohee in Licking Township; and Lake Placid in Jackson Township. Lake Blue Water is a spring-fed former stone quarry located one mile (1.6 km) east of Montpelier. The Shamrock Lakes (a group of six lakes) were created between 1960 and 1965, and the first lake was originally intended to be a water supply for a farmer&#x27;s cattle.

===Townships===
* Harrison
* Jackson Township (thought to be named after President Andrew Jackson; created by County Commission September 22, 1839.
* Licking
* Washington Township (named after President George Washington; created by County Commission June 29, 1839.

===Communities===
===Cities===
* Hartford City (county seat)
* Montpelier
* Dunkirk (mostly located in adjacent Jay County)

===Towns===
* Shamrock Lakes (incorporated May 21, 1973)

===Unincorporated communities===
* Converse (formerly named Crumley&#x27;s Crossing)
* Matamoras
* Millgrove
* Roll (formerly named Dundee)
* Trenton (former post office named Priam)

These communities are sometimes listed as ghost towns, most businesses in these communities have closed. However, residences are still maintained in these communities, and they are listed as populated places by the U.S. Geological Survey. Millgrove, Roll, and Trenton all had post offices during the 19th or 20th century.

====Extinct settlements====
Blackford County has over 10 communities that do not exist anymore. In some cases, a church, farm or single residence remains at the extinct community&#x27;s location. Among these former communities, Bowser Station, Dorsey Station, Mollie, Silas, and Slocum all had post offices during the 19th century. Mollie&#x27;s post office lasted until 1907.
* Bowser Station—This community was a railroad stop in southern Licking Township, and had a post office during the 1870s.
* Dorsey Station—This Harrison Township community was a railroad stop, and had a post office during the 1870s.
* Frog Alley—This Washington Township community had a church and school. &quot;Frog Alley&quot; arose because of the swampy condition of the area. The school, which began in 1863, lasted until 1923.
* Greenland—Located in Harrison Township at 400 North and 600 East.
* Little Chicago—Located in northwest corner of Harrison Township, and in Wells County.
* Mollie—This community thrived in the 1890s as a railroad stop with a grain elevator, post office, and general store. The Harrison Township oil fields were located nearby.
* Pleasantdale—Located in Harrison Township, at 300 North and 600 East.
* Renner (Licking Township) - a railroad stop at the Renner Stock Farm. Housing for the farm&#x27;s employees was also located there. It thrived from the 1890s until the 1920s. Renner is still listed as a populated place by the U.S. Geological Survey, but its &quot;population&quot; is a farm.
* Silas— (Washington Township) - the land was purchased in 1848, and the owner established a church and school. By 1880, a general store was established at that location, and its owner was community namesake Silas Rayl. During the first decade of the 20th century, the Silas general store closed, contributing to the demise of the community.
* Slocum (southeastern Harrison Township, exact location not known) - had a post office 1886–1902.
* Luck (Harrison Township at 250 North and 800 East)
* Winterhurst (Licking Township, at 200 South and East)

==Government==












The county government is a constitutional body granted specific powers by the Constitution of Indiana and the Indiana Code. The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all spending and revenue collection. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms and are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes and service taxes. In 2010, the county budgeted approximately $3.95 million for the district&#x27;s schools and $3.18 million for other county operations and services, for a total annual budget of approximately $7.1 million.

The executive body of the county is a board of commissioners. They are elected county-wide, in staggered four–year terms. One commissioner serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue and managing day-to-day functions of the county government.

The county maintains a small claims court that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.

The county has several other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor and circuit court clerk. Each serves a four–year term and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare party affiliations and be residents of the county.

Each township has a trustee who administers rural fire protection and ambulance service, provides poor relief and manages cemetery care, among other duties. The trustee is assisted in these duties by a three-member township board. The trustees and board members are elected to four-year terms.

==Climate and weather==

Blackford County has a typical Midwestern humid continental seasonal climate, and its Köppen climate classification is Dfa. There are four distinct seasons, with winters being cold with moderate snowfall, while summers can be warm and humid. In recent years, average temperatures in county seat Hartford City have ranged from a low of in January to a high of in July, although a record low of was recorded in January 1994 and a record high of was recorded in June 1988. Average monthly precipitation ranged from in February to in June.

March and April are considered tornado season in Indiana. Blackford County endured an F4 storm on Palm Sunday (April 11) in 1965. This storm was one of many tornadoes that occurred in the Midwest on that day. F4 tornadoes have maximum speeds of , and this one crossed Blackford County farmland east of Roll. Although there were no fatalities in Blackford County from this tornado, two people were killed in neighboring Wells County. The county has recorded at least five other tornadoes. The most recent tornadoes occurred in Hartford City in 2002. However, those Hartford City tornadoes were rated F1 on the Fujita scale—much less dangerous than an F4 tornado.

Blackford County has a record for hail. Hailstones in diameter fell in Hartford City on April 9, 2001. In a tie with the city of Cayuga, those hailstones are the largest ever recorded in the state of Indiana.

The biggest recorded snowstorm was the Great Blizzard of 1978, which occurred on January 26–27, 1978. A federal state of emergency was declared for Indiana at that time. Indiana governor Otis R. Bowen authorized the use of National Guard equipment, facilities, and personnel throughout the state. Low temperatures, high winds, and deep snow caused Hartford City to appear vacant, as schools and businesses closed. Wind gusts to caused snowdrifts high, making travel almost impossible. Snowmobiles were the only viable means of transportation, and volunteers from Hartford City&#x27;s Snowmobile Club provided emergency assistance.

==Economy==
 Blackford County&#x27;s economy is supported by a labor force of approximately 5,900 workers with an unemployment rate for June 2013 of 9.8 percent. There are industrial parks in Montpelier and Hartford City, and both cities are served by railroad line owned by Norfolk Southern. Over 30 employers of varying size are located in the county. The Blackford County School System has the most employees, with locations in both Hartford City and Montpelier. 3M Company is currently the largest manufacturer in the county, and has been located in Hartford City since its purchase of the Hartford City Paper Mill in 1955. Another business employing more than 100 people is Blackford County Community Hospital, located in Hartford City. Emhart Gripco is Montpelier&#x27;s leading employer, with over 100 employees.

Four categories account for over half the county&#x27;s employment: manufacturing, government, retail trade, and health care. The largest category is manufacturing, with about 19 percent of the county&#x27;s workforce. In addition to local Blackford County businesses, larger local economies in the more populous counties to the south and west offer employment and commerce, particularly in the city of Muncie in Delaware County, and the city of Marion in Grant County. Both counties employ more workers than their local workforce can provide. Agriculture has a significant impact on the county, although farm workers account for only about 5 percent of the county&#x27;s workers. In 2007, the county had 250 farms occupying , so four-fifths of Blackford County is farmland. Nearly are devoted to soybeans and corn. Wheat, hay, and oats are also grown. Livestock include over 24,000 hogs and pigs.

==Transportation==

There are no interstate highways in Blackford County, although Interstate 69 passes near the county&#x27;s western border.

State Road 3 enters the county from Delaware County on the south. It runs north through Hartford City and enters Wells County near Roll. State Road 18 runs west–east through the north end of the county, on its way from Marion to the Ohio border; it passes through Montpelier and Matamoras.

State Road 26 also runs from west to east, entering from Upland in Grant County and crossing Hartford City at State Road 3. It continues through Trenton to Jay County.

State Road 167 runs along the eastern border of the county for about as it goes north from Dunkirk; it terminates when it reaches State Road 26.

A Norfolk Southern Railway railroad line enters the county from the south after leaving Eaton; it runs about a mile to the east of State Road 3 until it reaches Hartford City where it veers to the northeast and passes through Montpelier. It continues into Wells County to the north. Norfolk Southern also owns Blackford County&#x27;s east–west line in southern Blackford county. An section of this line, between Converse and Hartford City, was abandoned during the last decade, and track has been removed. The line is still in service north of State Road 26, between Hartford City and Upland in Grant County. In October 2009, Central Railroad Company of Indianapolis pursued a leasing agreement to operate the east–west line with Norfolk Southern Railway in Blackford County. However, the line currently does not appear on the Central Railroad Company of Indianapolis system map.

==Education and health care==
The county&#x27;s five public schools are administered by the Blackford County School Corporation. During the 2010–11 school year, a total of 1,943 students attended these schools. The county school system was reorganized in 1963, after a county-wide vote favored a single school system for the entire county. As a result, Hartford City and Montpelier High Schools graduated their last classes in 1969, and a new high school serving the entire county was constructed in time for the 1969–1970 school year. Like the county, the new high school was named after Isaac Newton Blackford, and is called Blackford High School. The school is located a few miles north of Hartford City, near the center of the county. The school was designed for 1,200 students, and initial enrollment totaled to 1,150 students, serving grades 9 through 12. Current high school enrollment is less than 650. All students in grades 7 and 8 attend Blackford Junior High School. Although the county was served by eight elementary schools during the 1980s, consolidations have decreased the number of elementary schools to three. Montpelier Elementary School serves kindergarten through grade 6. In Hartford City, Southside Elementary School serves kindergarten through grade 3; students in grades 4–6 attend Northside Elementary School.

Four universities are near to Blackford County:
* Ball State University (Muncie)
* Ivy Tech State College-East Central (Muncie)
* Indiana Wesleyan University (a private school in Marion)
* Taylor University (a private school in Upland)

Montpelier and Hartford City both have public libraries. The Public Library of Montpelier and Harrison Township was built in 1907 and 1908. The building is known as the Montpelier Carnegie Library because it was made possible by a grant from philanthropist (and former business magnate) Andrew Carnegie. The library was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Hartford City&#x27;s Public library, built in 1903, was also funded by a grant from Carnegie. The Carnegie Fund required local towns to do fundraising to match the grants, and to commit to operating the libraries after their construction. In many localities, women&#x27;s groups were instrumental in organizing and doing fundraising for the libraries, both at the time of construction and since. Another library located in Hartford City belongs to the Blackford County Historical Society, and a museum is housed in the same building.

The Blackford County Health Department is located in Hartford City. The county&#x27;s hospital is Indiana University Health Blackford Hospital, a 15-bed facility in Hartford City. It opened January 2005.

==Media==

The first newspaper in Blackford County was &quot;The Hartford City Times&quot;, started by Dr. John Moler in 1852. Moler ran a drug store and print shop, and the &quot;Times&quot; was mostly an advertiser. At least one source considers &quot;The Blackford County News&quot;, which was started later in 1852, as the county&#x27;s first newspaper—possibly because the &quot;Times&quot; was mostly for advertising. &quot;The Montpelier Examiner&quot; was first published in 1879, and that newspaper is the predecessor of &quot;The Montpelier Herald.&quot; The county&#x27;s first daily newspaper, the &quot;Evening News&quot;, was started in 1894 by Edward Everett Cox in Hartford City. It was later renamed &quot;Hartford City News.&quot; After Cox&#x27;s death in the 1930s, his family sold the &quot;Hartford City News&quot; to the owners of Hartford City&#x27;s &quot;Times-Gazette,&quot; and the combined entity became the &quot;Hartford City News-Times&quot;. It continued through the years under several owners. In the twenty-first century, the newspaper titled itself &quot;News-Times,&quot; and calls itself &quot;Blackford County’s only daily newspaper&quot;.

The two major television markets that reach Blackford County are Indianapolis and Fort Wayne. Although a few lower-powered stations are located closer to Blackford County in cities such as Muncie, Marion, and Kokomo, these stations typically do not have a broadcast range that covers all of Blackford County. There are no AM radio stations based in Blackford County, although several adjacent AM signals are available, including from Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, Muncie, and Marion. Several adjacent FM radio signals are also available; there are also FM stations in Hartford City and Montpelier. Hartford City, Montpelier, and portions of the county&#x27;s rural areas have internet access available.

Astronaut Kevin A. Ford lived in Montpelier, Indiana, for several years and graduated from Blackford High School in 1978. He was born in Portland, Indiana, in 1960. Holding four academic degrees, Ford retired from active duty as a colonel in the United States Air Force in 2008. He was the pilot for the Space Shuttle Discovery during its August 2009 flight, and has logged over 332 hours in outer space. On October 23, 2012, Ford returned to the International Space Station aboard a Russian spacecraft.

Clarence G. Johnson, who lived in Hartford City from 1923 until he died in 1935, was the first president of Overhead Door Corporation. He was a pioneer in the development of garage doors, and holds numerous patents. One of Johnson&#x27;s more notable inventions is the first &quot;electric operator for sectional upward-acting doors&quot;.

He was elected as Indiana&#x27;s lieutenant governor in 1932. He won the 1936 election for governor, and served the single four-year term allowed by law. After his service in his home state, Townsend worked in the federal administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in agriculture–related assignments.

<text>Benton County is located in the northwest part of the U.S. state of Indiana, along the border with Illinois. As of 2020, the county&#x27;s population was 8,719. It contains six incorporated towns as well as several small unincorporated settlements; it is divided into 11 townships which provide local services. The county seat is Fowler. Benton County is part of the Lafayette, Indiana, Metropolitan Statistical Area.
==History==
The lands of present NW Indiana were explored by French explorer Robert de LaSalle. At that time the area was inhabited by the Miami Confederation of Indians. Through White settlement, encroachment, and confrontation, the various indigenous groups were forced to cede their claim to the area. In October 1818, the Pottawattamies, Weas, and Delawares ceded their lands west of the Tippecanoe River to the government. In a treaty dated October 23, 1826, the Pottawattamie and Miamis ceded all their lands east of the Tippecanoe. A treaty dated October 26, 1832, with the Pottawattamie ceded control of the northwestern part of Indiana; on October 27 the Pottawattamie of Indiana and Michigan also relinquished all claim to any remaining land in those states.

Before 1832, this area was not open to settlement; previous settlers had taken the southern parts of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. Northwestern Indiana was also less desirable for farming, being described as alternate swamps, sterile sand ridges and flat, wet prairies, although it did proliferate in game.

A state legislative act dated February 7, 1835, created two counties in this area, Newton and Jasper. The county governments were not created at that time and the counties were attached to White County for administrative purposes. The Jasper County organization was effected beginning March 15, 1838. On February 18, 1840, the county of Benton was formed from Jasper&#x27;s area. It was named for Thomas H. Benton (D), U.S. Senator from Missouri. The original county seat selected in 1843 was Oxford, but after a long struggle between contending factions it was moved to Fowler in 1874.

=== Courthouse ===
The current Benton County courthouse, located in Fowler, was designed by Gurdon P. Randall of Chicago and built in 1874 by Levi L. Leach at a cost of $62,257. The new courthouse was an impressive building from an architectural standpoint, but also provided much-needed improvements in security, including large fire-proof vaults. Randall had designed the Marshall County courthouse a few years earlier.

==Economy==
In 2008 the Benton County Wind Farm began operating with 87 1.5 MW wind turbines. Duke Energy purchases electricity from the wind farm and sells it to customers through its GoGreen program.

In 2009 the Fowler Ridge Wind Farm opened nearby, giving Benton County one of the largest concentrations of wind turbines in the United States east of the Mississippi River.

==Geography==

Benton County lies along the state&#x27;s western border with Illinois. It consists of low rolling hills, with all available terrain devoted to agriculture or development.

==Government==

The county government is a constitutional body granted specific powers by the Constitution of Indiana and the Indiana Code. The county council is the legislative branch of the county government, controlling spending and revenue collection. Representatives, elected to staggered four-year terms from county districts, determine salaries, the annual budget and special spending. The council has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes and service taxes. In 2010, the county budgeted approximately $5 million for the district&#x27;s schools and $2.8 million for other county operations and services, for a total annual budget of approximately $7.8 million.

The Board of Commissioners is the county&#x27;s executive body. They are elected countywide, in staggered four-year terms. One commissioner serves as board president. The commissioners execute acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue and managing day-to-day functions of the county government.

The county maintains a small claims court that can handle some civil cases. The court judge is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.

The county has several other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor and circuit court clerk. They are elected to four-year terms. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare party affiliations and be residents of the county.

Each township has a trustee who administers rural fire protection and ambulance service, provides poor relief and manages cemetery care, among other duties. The trustee is assisted in these duties by a three-member township board. The trustees and board members are elected to four-year terms.

Benton County is in Indiana&#x27;s 4th Congressional District, represented by Jim Baird in the United States Congress. It is part of Indiana Senate district 6 and Indiana House of Representatives district 13. It had previously been part of House District 15.

<text>Bartholomew County is a county located in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 82,208 at the 2020 census. The county seat is Columbus. The county was determined by the U.S. Census Bureau to be home to the mean center of U.S. population in 1900. Bartholomew County makes up the Columbus, Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is part of the Indianapolis-Carmel-Muncie Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Bartholomew County was formed on February 12, 1821, and was named for Lt. Col. Joseph Bartholomew, wounded at the Battle of Tippecanoe. The site of the county seat was chosen on February 15, 1821, by a team of commissioners, who suggested the name Tiptona, in honor of John Tipton. 

===Courthouse===

The current Bartholomew County courthouse was built from 1870 to 1874 by McCormack and Sweeney of Columbus at a cost of $225,000.

It was designed by architect Isaac Hodgson, who was born in Belfast, Ireland in 1826 and immigrated to the United States in 1848; he designed six Indiana courthouses, including the one in Henry County.

The courthouse is built largely of brick and has mansard roofs typical of the Second Empire French style. Its asymmetrical &quot;L&quot; shape allows it to face two major streets in Columbus. The inscription indicating the commissioners, architect and date is high up on the east facade.

Today the Bartholomew County Veterans Memorial designed by American architect Charles Rose sits adjacent to the Courthouse.

The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.

Board of Commissioners: The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.

Court: The county maintains a small claims court that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.

County Officials: The county has several other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare a party affiliation and to be residents of the county.

The county is named for Colonel John Allen, an attorney and Kentucky state senator who was killed in the War of 1812. Fort Wayne, founded at the confluences of the Maumee, St. Joseph, and St. Marys rivers, was chosen as the county seat in May 1824.

===Amish community===
Since 1852, Allen County has been home to an Old Order Amish community that speaks an Alsatian dialect, which is quite rare among Amish. There are about 3,190 Amish living around Grabill and New Haven as of 2017.

==Government==

The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the Constitution of Indiana, and by the Indiana Code.

County Council: The seven member county council has the ultimate decision-making power regarding fiscal affairs of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Four representatives are elected from county districts, and three members are elected at large. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.

Board of Commissioners: The executive and administrative body of the county is made of a three-member board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners serves as president of the board. The commissioners are charged with enacting and executing legislation, the collection of revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.

Court: The county maintains a Circuit Court and a Superior Court. These are the trial courts of general jurisdiction. Allen Superior Court hears the vast majority of cases, and has several divisions with multiple courtrooms. There are 9 judges hearing cases on the Allen Superior Court; the Chief Judge of the Allen Superior Court is the Honorable Frances &quot;Fran&quot; C. Gull, first elected as a judge in 1996.

County Officials: The county has several other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare a party affiliation and to be residents of the county.

The county government operates the jail, maintains rural roads, operates the major local courts, keeps files of deeds and mortgages, maintains vital records, administers public health regulations, and participates with the state in the provision of welfare and other social services.

Allen County is part of Indiana&#x27;s 3rd congressional district and is represented by Jim Banks in the United States Congress. It is part of Indiana Senate districts 14, 15, 16, 17 and 19; and Indiana House of Representatives districts 50, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84 and 85.

Over the last 100 years, Allen County has been a Republican stronghold in presidential elections. The Democratic national landslides of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 and 1936 as well as Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 constitute the only occasions since then that a Republican presidential candidate failed to carry the county, and even in 1964, Johnson only won the county by 1.4% and less than 1,500 votes. As of 2020, Joe Biden was the highest vote earner for a Democratic candidate in the history of the county with 73,189 votes. Donald Trump achieved the same feat for his party, with 92,083 votes. 

Although Allen County is rather conservative for an urban county, the presence of Fort Wayne makes the county one of the Democrats&#x27; strongest counties in Indiana. In 2008, Barack Obama became the first Democratic president after Johnson to receive 40% of the county&#x27;s vote. While he lost the county by 4 points, the closest that a Democrat has come to carrying the county, he won the city of Fort Wayne itself by six points. However, in 2016, Donald Trump won the county by 19 points and city by 6, but in 2020, while Joe Biden lost the county by 11 points, he recaptured Fort Wayne. The last Democratic Governor to win the county was Frank O&#x27;Bannon in 2000 and the last Senator was Evan Bayh during his 2004 landslide.

Following the 1930 Census, Fort Wayne was drawn into Indiana&#x27;s 4th congressional district, which essentially became the 3rd district following 2000 Census. Fort Wayne has been represented in House by Republicans for all but 20 years since 1932. The streak was only broken by four Democrats: James Indus Farley from 1933 to 1939, Edward H. Kruse for a single term in 1949–1951, J. Edward Roush from 1971 to 1977 and Jill Long Thompson from 1989 to 1995.

==Court house==

The Allen County Courthouse was designed by Brentwood S. Tolan of Fort Wayne, and was built by James Stewart and Company of Saint Louis, Missouri. When the cornerstone was laid in 1897, the oldest man in the county, Louis Peltier, was present; he remembered Fort Wayne when it was a fort. The courthouse was completed in 1902 at a total cost of $817,553. At its dedication, Mayor Henry C. Berghoff and Governor Winfield T. Durbin were present. President Theodore Roosevelt was scheduled to attend as well, although he ultimately did not. Built in the Beaux-Arts architecture style, it was one of the most expensive courthouses in the state. It also was filled with artwork that cost more than other entire courthouses of the time. The courthouse has been protected as a National Historic Landmark since 2003. The building is now used primarily as a government annex, as most of the offices were moved across Main Street to the Edwin J. Rousseau Centre in 1971.

==Economy==
In the latter half of the 20th century, shifts in manufacturing patterns led to the reduction of the number of manufacturing plants and jobs in Allen County. However, Allen County&#x27;s economy has diversified with time to include defense and security, healthcare, and insurance. Agriculture is also a vital part of the county&#x27;s economy. In 2009, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked the Fort Wayne metropolitan area 67th on its list of 200 metropolitan areas in the &quot;Best Places For Business And Careers&quot; report. Individually, Fort Wayne was ranked 5th in cost of living and 12th in cost of doing business.

<doc id="96149" wikidata="Q254138" url="?curid=96149" title="Slipknot (band)">
<text>Slipknot ( ) is an American heavy metal band formed in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1995 by percussionist Shawn Crahan, former vocalist Anders Colsefni, and bassist Paul Gray. After several lineup changes in its early years, the band settled on nine members for more than a decade: Crahan, Gray, Joey Jordison, Craig Jones, Mick Thomson, Corey Taylor, Sid Wilson, Chris Fehn, and Jim Root. Slipknot is well known for its attention-grabbing image, aggressive style of music, and energetic and chaotic live shows.

The band rapidly rose to fame following the release of their debut album &quot;Slipknot&quot; in 1999. The 2001 follow-up album, &quot;Iowa&quot;, although darker in tone, made the band more popular. After a brief hiatus, Slipknot returned in 2004 with &quot;Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)&quot;, before going on another hiatus and returning in 2008 with its fourth album, &quot;All Hope Is Gone&quot;, which debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. After another long hiatus, Slipknot released its fifth studio album, &quot;.5: The Gray Chapter&quot;, in 2014. Their sixth studio album, &quot;We Are Not Your Kind&quot;, was released on August 9, 2019. Their seventh studio album, &quot;The End, So Far&quot;, was released on September 30, 2022. The band has released two live albums titled &quot;9.0: Live&quot; and &quot;Day of the Gusano: Live in Mexico&quot;, a compilation album titled &quot;Antennas to Hell&quot;, and five live DVDs. The band has sold 30 million records worldwide and over 12 million in their home country.

Bassist Gray died on May 24, 2010, and was replaced during 2011–2014 by Donnie Steele. After the death of Gray, the only founding member in the current lineup is percussionist Crahan. Jordison was dismissed from the band on December 12, 2013. Steele left during the recording sessions for &quot;.5: The Gray Chapter&quot;. The band found replacements in Alessandro Venturella on bass and Jay Weinberg on drums. Fehn was also dismissed from the band in March 2019 prior to the writing of &quot;We Are Not Your Kind&quot; and was replaced by Michael Pfaff. The band parted ways with Jones and Weinberg in 2023, with the latter being replaced by Eloy Casagrande the following year.

==History==
===Background (1991–1995)===

In the years before Slipknot formed, a state of shifting band membership existed throughout the heavy metal scene in Des Moines, Iowa. In 1991, the biggest heavy metal band in Des Moines was Atomic Opera, with Jim Root on guitar. Drummer Joey Jordison founded a thrash metal band called Modifidious, playing at a club called Runway. Modifidious opened for Atomic Opera on December 1, 1991, at the Runway, after which their guitarist left for the more successful Atomic Opera. Jordison replaced him with local guitarist Craig Jones. Drummer Shawn Crahan formed another Des Moines band called Heads on the Wall, playing funk metal cover songs at clubs and releasing a demo tape in July 1992. A fourth Des Moines band called Vexx played death metal with Anders Colsefni on drums, Paul Gray on bass, and Josh Brainard on guitar and vocals. Colsefni later took over vocal duties, but Vexx never recorded. During this time, Crahan often went to the Runway on Sundays when the club opened to all ages, where he met other young musicians with whom he could jam. By March 1993, Crahan was jamming with vocalist Colsefni, bassist Gray and guitarist Patrick Neuwirth, writing and playing songs in Gray&#x27;s basement, discussing possible band names, but never making a final decision. One of the songs they recorded was titled &quot;Slipknot&quot;. The word on the second recording’s spine was &quot;Painface&quot;, which Colsefni later used to name his band Painface.

In 1993, a new band called Inveigh Catharsis formed in Des Moines, with Gray on bass, Brainard on guitar and Colsefni on drums. Jordison jammed occasionally with this group. Brainard eventually left to join Jordison and Jones in Modifidious, participating in demo recordings at the end of &#x27;93 and early in &#x27;94. During 1994, Modifidious sometimes played the same shows as Crahan&#x27;s Heads on the Wall band. Gray formed a death metal band called Body Pit, soon becoming popular in the local scene. Modifidious stopped playing in the wake of death metal&#x27;s increasing pull. Gray failed to get Jordison to join Body Pit, but soon after he recruited local guitar teacher Mick Thomson, the band broke up.

In September 1995, Colsefni, Crahan and Gray started a band named the Pale Ones. As guitarists, the band decided to invite Brainard and local musician Donnie Steele. Not long after their inception, Gray invited Jordison to a rehearsal because the band was interested in experimenting with additional drum elements. Jordison subsequently joined the band as their drummer, bringing their lineup to six members with Crahan moving to percussion. Furthermore, Colsefni also took up percussion while remaining the band&#x27;s vocalist. The band made their public debut on November 5 at a benefit show in Des Moines, using the name Meld.

===&quot;Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.&quot; and beginnings (1995–1998)===

Much of the band&#x27;s early development was retrospectively attributed to late-night planning sessions between Gray, Crahan and Jordison at a Sinclair gas station where Jordison worked nights. It was there, in late 1995, that Jordison suggested changing the band name to Slipknot after their song of the same name. In December, Slipknot began recording material at &quot;SR Audio&quot;, a studio in the band&#x27;s hometown. As they didn&#x27;t have a recording contract, the band self-financed the project, the costs of which came to an estimated $40,000. In February 1996, guitarist Donnie Steele, a Christian, left Slipknot after discussions regarding the band&#x27;s lyrics with the producer, Sean McMahon. Jordison said of Steele&#x27;s departure: &quot;(he) was having these God talks, when we were supposed to be working... We were prepared to keep him on, but he didn&#x27;t want to stay.&quot; Steele himself has said: &quot;I left for a few reasons...I had a lot on my mind spiritually.&quot; During the mixing stages of their project at &quot;SR Audio&quot;, Craig Jones was recruited as Steele&#x27;s replacement on guitar. However, throughout their time in the studio, the band were adding samples to their recordings but could not produce these sounds live. Subsequently, Jones became the band&#x27;s sampler and Mick Thomson was brought in as the replacement guitarist. After a complicated time with mixing and mastering, the band self-released &quot;Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.&quot; on Halloween, October 31, 1996.

Distribution for the demo was initially left to the band and their producer Sean McMahon, before it was handed over to the distribution company Recordings in early 1997. Slipknot received a small amount of airplay on local radio stations off the back of the demo. However, it did not lead to any kind of interest from record labels, so the band returned to the studio to develop new material. It was at this time that the band sought more melodic vocals for their music. As a result, Corey Taylor was recruited from fellow Des Moines band Stone Sour; this moved Colsefni to backing vocals and percussion. While working in the studio, Slipknot continued to do local shows, during one of which in September 1997, Colsefni announced on stage that he was leaving the band. The gap on percussion was filled by Greg Welts, who was affectionately known as &quot;Cuddles&quot;. In early 1998, Slipknot produced a second demo featuring five tracks exclusively for record labels. The band began to receive much attention from record labels, and in February 1998, producer Ross Robinson offered to produce their debut album after attending rehearsals in Des Moines. Soon after, DJ Sid Wilson was recruited as the band&#x27;s ninth member after showing great interest and impressing band members. In late June, Slipknot received a $500,000, seven-album deal, from Roadrunner Records; the band signed the deal publicly on July 8, 1998. Two days prior to this, Welts was fired from the band, something which Slipknot refuse to comment on. Welts was replaced by Brandon Darner, who departed from the band shortly after joining.

===&quot;Slipknot&quot; and rise to fame (1998–2000)===

Chris Fehn was brought in to replace Darner on percussion before Slipknot traveled to Malibu, California, to work on their debut album in September 1998. Partway through the recording process of the album, Slipknot returned to Des Moines for the Christmas period. During that period, guitarist Brainard decided to leave the band. Brainard said, &quot;some decisions were made that I wasn&#x27;t particularly happy with&quot;. Slipknot later recruited Jim Root to complete their lineup and the band returned to Malibu to continue work on the album. Work on the album concluded in early 1999, allowing the band to go on their first tour as part of the Ozzfest lineup in 1999. Ozzfest greatly increased Slipknot&#x27;s audience, furthering the band&#x27;s success with their self-titled album that was released on June 29, 1999. Slipknot released its first home video &quot;Welcome to Our Neighborhood&quot;, which was directed by Thomas Mignone, and the singles &quot;Wait and Bleed&quot; and &quot;Spit It Out&quot;, which were also directed by Mignone. The singles received some airplay, but Slipknot quickly developed a large following, mainly from touring and word of mouth. The band toured several countries throughout 1999 and 2000 in support of the album. In early 2000, &quot;Slipknot&quot; was certified platinum; a first for an album released by Roadrunner Records.

===&quot;Iowa&quot; (2001–2003)===

Anticipation for Slipknot&#x27;s second album was intense. In early 2001, the band began recording the second album at Sound City and Sound Image studios in Los Angeles. Around this time, conflicts arose between band members due to extensive touring and recording schedules. Recording of their second album ended in February 2001 and the band embarked on their Iowa World Tour. Entitled &quot;Iowa&quot;, Slipknot&#x27;s second album—released on August 28, 2001—peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and at number one in the UK. The album produced three singles; &quot;The Heretic Anthem&quot; (promotional single), &quot;Left Behind&quot; and &quot;My Plague&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. In 2002, Slipknot appeared in &quot;Rollerball&quot; (2002), performing &quot;I Am Hated&quot;. The release and intense promotion of the album resulted in sold-out shows in large arenas in several countries.

In mid-2002, Slipknot went on hiatus because of internal conflicts, and band members focused on side projects. Vocalist Taylor and guitarist Root revived their band Stone Sour, drummer Jordison created Murderdolls with vocalist Wednesday 13, percussionist Crahan founded To My Surprise and DJ Wilson went solo as DJ Starscream. Both Taylor and Jordison appeared on MTV unmasked for the first time in public promoting their respective bands. For a while, the future of Slipknot was uncertain and there was much speculation about whether there would be a third album, or if the split would become permanent. An official update appeared on their official website on January 24, 2003, denying those claims. &quot;I don&#x27;t have a problem with anyone in Slipknot,&quot; Jordison protested. &quot;I&#x27;ve seen comments from Corey saying there are things to be resolved, but I have no fucking idea what he&#x27;s talking about.&quot;

Nonetheless, on November 22, 2002, Slipknot released their second DVD, &quot;Disasterpieces&quot;.

===&quot;Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)&quot; (2003–2007)===

After several delays, Slipknot moved into The Mansion in Los Angeles, California, in mid-2003 to work on their third album alongside producer Rick Rubin. By early 2004, work on the album had finished and the band began The Subliminal Verses World Tour with their appearance on the Jägermeister Music Tour in March 2004. &quot;Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)&quot; was released on May 24, 2004; it peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts. The album produced six singles; &quot;Duality&quot;, &quot;Vermilion&quot;, &quot;Vermilion, Pt. 2&quot;, &quot;Before I Forget&quot;, &quot;The Nameless&quot;, and The Blister Exists. Slipknot recorded its first live album, &quot;9.0: Live&quot;, while touring in support of the band&#x27;s third album. Released on November 1, 2005 &quot;9.0: Live&quot; peaked at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts. Touring in support of &quot;Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)&quot; continued through 2004 and up to the end of 2005 before Slipknot went on hiatus for the second time.

In 2005, several members of Slipknot were involved in &quot;Roadrunner United: The All-Star Sessions&quot;, a collaborative album recorded by artists signed to Roadrunner Records for the label&#x27;s 25th anniversary. 2006 saw Slipknot win their first Grammy Award, picking up the Best Metal Performance award for the single &quot;Before I Forget&quot;. The single went on to be featured on the set list of &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot;. On December 5, 2006, Slipknot released its third DVD &quot;&quot;. While Slipknot was on hiatus, several band members again focused their attentions on side projects; vocalist Taylor and guitarist Root returned to Stone Sour, drummer Jordison toured with several bands and produced 3 Inches of Blood&#x27;s third album &quot;Fire Up the Blades&quot;, Crahan founded Dirty Little Rabbits and Wilson returned as DJ Starscream once again.

===&quot;All Hope Is Gone&quot; and Gray&#x27;s death (2008–2010)===
Preparation for Slipknot&#x27;s fourth album began towards the end of 2007; work began at Sound Farm Studio in Jamaica, Iowa, with producer Dave Fortman in February 2008. The album was finished in June, and the band went on the All Hope Is Gone World Tour on July 9, 2008. Slipknot&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;All Hope Is Gone&quot;, was released on August 20, 2008, debuting at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart. The album produced five singles; &quot;All Hope Is Gone&quot;, &quot;Psychosocial&quot;, &quot;Dead Memories&quot;, &quot;Sulfur&quot; and &quot;Snuff&quot;. 2009 marked the 10th anniversary of Slipknot&#x27;s debut album; to commemorate the event, the band released a special-edition version of &quot;Slipknot&quot; on September 9, 2009. The band toured in support of the album throughout 2008 and continued until October 31, 2009, resulting in Slipknot&#x27;s third hiatus.

In 2010, Gray was planning to tour with the supergroup, Hail!, but on May 24, 2010, he was found dead in an Urbandale, Iowa, hotel room. Circumstances surrounding his death at the time were not immediately known; an autopsy suspected his death was not intentional but did not reveal the cause. The day after his death, the remaining eight members of the band held a live, unmasked, press conference alongside Gray&#x27;s widow and brother. On June 21, the cause of death was confirmed as an accidental overdose of morphine and synthetic morphine substitute fentanyl.

The band was hesitant to comment on the future of Slipknot. The members made conflicting statements in interviews; drummer Jordison told &quot;The Pulse of Radio&quot; &quot;there is another Slipknot record already kinda in the making&quot;. Vocalist Taylor told &quot;FMQB&quot; Productions he was &quot;very conflicted about whether or not [he wants] to do anything with Slipknot&quot;. The band released their fourth video album &quot;(sic)nesses&quot; on September 28, 2010; it debuted at number one on the Billboard Top Music Video Charts. The DVD features Slipknot&#x27;s entire live performance at the 2009 Download Festival and a 45-minute film documenting their tour in support of &quot;All Hope Is Gone&quot;, and served as a tribute to Paul Gray.

===Return to the stage, &quot;Antennas to Hell&quot; and &quot;Knotfest&quot; (2011–2012)===


Regarding the continuation of Slipknot, Taylor told &quot;NME&quot; Gray would want them to continue and he felt they should but he was ambivalent about returning to the band. Slipknot returned to touring in 2011, performing a small number of shows in Europe. They headlined the Sonisphere Festival and Rock in Rio alongside Iron Maiden and Metallica, and performed at Belgium&#x27;s Graspop Metal Meeting. Donnie Steele substituted for Gray in the concerts; he was positioned behind Jordison and obscured from the audience&#x27;s view.

Slipknot also said the band would complete and release the band&#x27;s fifth studio album, and that there were no plans to replace Gray. Jordison said the writing process for the album had already begun and that he had written 17 songs.
Slipknot performed at the Mayhem Festival tour of 2012.

On May 29, 2012, Roadrunner Records posted a teaser video titled &quot;Antennas to Hell&quot; on its website. Later that day, on Twitter, Corey Taylor said Slipknot will release a greatest hits album on June 17, 2012. He also said the band was not yet recording new material but was putting together demos for a new album.

Slipknot&#x27;s first annual music festival, called &quot;Knotfest&quot;, was held on August 17, 2012, at Mid-America Motorplex near Pacific Junction, Iowa, and on August 18, 2012, in Somerset, Wisconsin. Deftones, Lamb of God, and Serj Tankian also performed at the festival. The festival shows also debuted a Slipknot museum. On June 14, 2013, Slipknot headlined the Download Festival for a second time. The band performed to roughly 90,000 people and was twice forced to stop the set—once in the middle of a song—to allow the front barricade, which had split open under crowd pressure, to be repaired.

===Jordison&#x27;s departure, &quot;.5: The Gray Chapter&quot; and new members (2013–2016)===
Production of the band&#x27;s fifth album began in late 2013. Taylor described the album as &quot;very dark&quot; and a cross between &quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;Vol. 3 (The Subliminal Verses)&quot;. Guitarist Jim Root did not participate in Stone Sour&#x27;s January tour so he could write material for Slipknot.

On December 12, 2013, the band announced through its official website that Joey Jordison had left the band after 18 years, citing personal reasons. On his official Facebook page, Jordison later said he &quot;did not quit Slipknot&quot; and that he was &quot;shocked&quot; and &quot;blindsided&quot; by the news. Both Jordison and Slipknot independently promised to release further details about the split. Taylor said Jordison would not be appearing on the new album because he did not participate in any songwriting sessions before his departure. After years of both sides being silent and evasive as to the reasons for his leaving the band, Jordison revealed in June 2016 that he suffered from Transverse myelitis, a neurological disease that cost him the ability to play the drums toward the end of his time with Slipknot. However, Jordison played drums in the blackened death metal act Sinsaenum, which he joined in 2016.

In July 2014, Slipknot began releasing teasers for the new album on the band&#x27;s website and social media using cryptic messages and gory imagery. &quot;The Negative One&quot;, the band&#x27;s first song in six years, was released on August 1; it was accompanied by a music video directed by Crahan that was released four days later. The video did not feature any band members. On August 24, Slipknot released an official radio single titled &quot;The Devil In I&quot;, and the name of the upcoming album was announced as &quot;.5: The Gray Chapter&quot; on iTunes, with an expected release date of October 28. The release was later preponed to October 17 for the Netherlands and Australia, October 20 for the UK and October 21 worldwide. &quot;The Negative One&quot; was nominated for the 2014 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.

Slipknot began touring North America in support of the album on October 25 at the second iteration of Knotfest. The tour dubbed the &quot;Prepare for Hell&quot; was co-headlined by Korn with King 810 as support. The band also performed at 2015&#x27;s Soundwave festival in Australia. A bassist and drummer were brought in to replace Gray and Jordison respectively, Crahan designing a mask that would differentiate them from the band. The official video for &quot;The Devil In I&quot;, featuring musicians wearing modified versions of the band&#x27;s old masks—with the exception of Taylor, Wilson and Crahan who all wore new masks — was released on September 12. Fans speculated upon the identities of the drummer and bassist shown in the video but the band did not officially name them.

Taylor later said he was &quot;upset&quot; at the leak of the identity of the bassist, alleged to be Alessandro Venturella because of a unique tattoo on his hand, though he&#x27;d later clarify that he meant that in jest. Root told &quot;Guitar World&quot; the drummer&#x27;s identity would not be released, and that the bassist and the drummer were not permanent members of the band. On December 3, a former Slipknot road crew member posted a photograph of a touring band personnel list that confirmed bassist Alessandro Venturella and drummer Jay Weinberg were members of the tour.

On March 11, 2015, while the band was not touring, guitarist Mick Thomson was hospitalized after a drunken knife fight with his brother at Thomson&#x27;s home in Iowa. The pair sustained serious, but non life-threatening, injuries. On August 2, 2015, during a concert in Hartford, Connecticut, the band was forced to stop performing after Venturella was suddenly rushed to hospital, after undergoing a medical emergency. After 20 minutes, singer Taylor told the audience the band would continue the concert, performing without Venturella. It was later discovered that Venturella had collapsed because of extreme dehydration. 

On September 25, 2016, the band performed at their annual festival Knotfest, which was altered to include Ozzfest this year. They performed the &quot;Iowa&quot; album in its entirety. In the meanwhile, Crahan made his directorial debut with the feature film &quot;Officer Downe&quot;, based on a graphic novel of the same name and starring actor Kim Coates. In November 2016, Slipknot percussionist Shawn &quot;Clown&quot; Crahan revealed during an interview with Rolling Stone that he and fellow guitarist Jim Root would be teaming up in February 2017 to begin writing new material for a new Slipknot album because &quot;we want to write.&quot;

=== &quot;We Are Not Your Kind&quot; and Fehn&#x27;s departure (2017–2020) ===
Slipknot singer Corey Taylor regrouped with his other band Stone Sour in 2017, and they released their album &quot;Hydrograd&quot; on June 30. Talking about his first work in cinema and the other Slipknot members&#x27; plans, in an interview with WRIF&#x27;s Meltdown, Crahan revealed that &quot;we&#x27;re beginning to write some music for Slipknot for the new record. We have songs that we&#x27;ve written that are amazing.&quot; In December 2017, Crahan appeared on &quot;The Jasta Show&quot; podcast, where he stated that the next Slipknot album could be his last with the band.

Corey Taylor revealed in October 2018 that the band would enter the studio in early 2019, with a targeted release for their sixth album that same year, followed by a world tour. On October 31, the single &quot;All Out Life&quot; was released, as was an accompanying music video. On March 4, 2019, the band announced that the release date for the next album would be August 9, 2019, and that they would be embarking on the Knotfest Roadshow along with support by Gojira, Volbeat, and Behemoth to support the album. On March 7, Slipknot were revealed to be the opening act for Metallica&#x27;s six WorldWired Tour dates in Australia and New Zealand from October 17 through October 31.

On March 14, 2019, Chris Fehn filed a lawsuit against the band citing withheld payments. Fehn specifically accused Corey Taylor and Shawn Crahan of setting up several band-related business entities, in different states, that collect money from the band. Fehn called for full forensic accounting to be done on all of the band&#x27;s companies and assets in order to collect any profits and damages he may be owed. On that same day, Taylor responded via Twitter with a tweet stating, &quot;You&#x27;re gonna read a lot of bullshit today. This is all I&#x27;ll say. JUST YOU WAIT TIL THE TRUTH COMES OUT. Long Live The Knot&quot;. On March 18, 2019, the band officially announced via their website that Fehn was no longer a member of the band, stating, &quot;Slipknot&#x27;s focus is on making album #6, and our upcoming shows around the world, our best ever. Chris knows why he is no longer a part of Slipknot. We are disappointed that he chose to point fingers and manufacture claims, rather than doing what was necessary to continue to be a part of Slipknot. We would have preferred he not take the path that he has, but evolution in all things is a necessary part of this life. Long Live The Knot&quot;. However, a few days later, the message was removed from the website and according to Fehn&#x27;s lawyer, the percussionist&#x27;s employment status with the band had not changed since his initial filing. Fehn was replaced by a percussionist, whose identity was concealed, who the fans have dubbed &quot;Tortilla Man&quot;. &quot;Loudwire&quot; has reported that fans have linked his identity as Michael Pfaff, a former member of Crahan&#x27;s side project Dirty Little Rabbits. The band officially confirmed Pfaff&#x27;s identity on March 16, 2022, almost two years later.
On May 13, 2019, the band teased something was coming on May 16, ahead of their performance on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, as well as screenshots of their new masks. On that day, the album&#x27;s title was revealed to be &quot;We Are Not Your Kind&quot;, along with its tracklist and a music video for &quot;Unsainted&quot;, where the new masks and outfits for the nine band members were shown for the first time, including an as-yet-unknown new percussionist. On July 22, they released the second single from their upcoming album, titled &quot;Solway Firth&quot;. This was accompanied by a music video which featured live footage from their 2019 shows as well as clips and audio from &quot;The Boys&quot;. On August 5, &quot;Birth of the Cruel&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single, accompanied by a music video. On August 9, four days after they had released &quot;Birth of the Cruel&quot;, they released their sixth album &quot;We Are Not Your Kind&quot;.

In August 2019, Crahan announced the band will release an experimental album of outtakes from the 2008 &quot;All Hope Is Gone&quot; sessions, titled &quot;Look Outside Your Window&quot;. The album was recorded with just 4 members (Crahan, Taylor, Root, and Wilson), in a different studio away from the other members, is expected to have 11 tracks that Taylor described as having a &quot;Radiohead vibe&quot;, and Crahan saying in 2018 &quot;it is not a Slipknot album&quot;. The band also released a twenty-minute experimental short film directed by Crahan and titled &quot;Pollution&quot;. One of the segments of the film is the music video for the song, &quot;Nero Forte&quot;, which was released as the album&#x27;s fourth and final single on December 16, 2019.

=== &quot;The End, So Far&quot; and Jones&#x27; and Weinberg&#x27;s departures (2021–2023) ===
On May 19, 2021, Shawn Crahan revealed that the band had been currently making &quot;god music&quot;. In an article published by &quot;Loudwire&quot; on June 9, 2021, Shawn Crahan revealed that a new Slipknot album would &#x27;hopefully&#x27; be released in 2021. He also added that the band would be parting ways with Roadrunner Records following the release of the album.

On July 26, 2021, the band&#x27;s former drummer, Joey Jordison, died in his sleep at the age of 46.

In November 2021, the band started teasing new material on a new domain &quot;thechapeltownrag.com&quot;. Several snippets of a song were shown on the website leading to speculation of a new single that the band would later confirm on November 4, with the single titled &quot;The Chapeltown Rag&quot; slated for release the following day alongside its live debut at the Knotfest Roadshow in Los Angeles, California, on November 5, 2021. In December 2021, Taylor revealed that the band were planning on mixing their seventh studio album in January, and hoped to release it by April 2022. He also stated that he preferred the material on their forthcoming seventh studio album to that on &quot;We Are Not Your Kind&quot;.

On July 19, 2022, the band announced their seventh album, titled &quot;The End, So Far&quot;, along with the album&#x27;s second single &quot;The Dying Song (Time to Sing)&quot;. On August 5, 2022, the third single from the album, &quot;Yen&quot;, was released. The album was released on September 30, 2022. It is Slipknot&#x27;s final album for Roadrunner, whose contract with the label expired on April 1, 2023. The band&#x27;s final single for the label, &quot;Bone Church&quot; was surprise-released on February 2, 2023.

On June 7, 2023, the band announced that it had parted ways with sampler and keyboardist Craig &quot;133&quot; Jones, who had been a member since 1996; the social media posts about Jones&#x27; departure were subsequently deleted within the hour. The same day, the band played a show at the Nova Rock Festival in Austria, with someone who appeared to be a new member of the band replacing Jones. There has been speculation on who the new member is, with the main contenders being Zac Baird, Nathan Church or Jones himself in a new mask. On November 5, the band announced that they had parted ways with Jay Weinberg; like with Jones, social media posts about his departure were subsequently deleted.

On December 9, 2023, the band announced the first leg of their 25th anniversary tour with stops in the UK and Europe.
=== 25th anniversary touring, Casagrande&#x27;s joining, and upcoming eighth studio album (2024–present) ===
In April 2024, Slipknot began teasing events for the 25th anniversary of their debut album. In the metadata for the promotional material, fans found the names &quot;Jeff&quot; and &quot;Eloy&quot;, leading to speculation that the new sampler and drummer are ex-Dirty Little Rabbits bassist Jeff Karnowski and former Sepultura drummer Eloy Casagrande, respectively. Casagrande&#x27;s identity would be confirmed shortly afterwards, when he debuted as the band&#x27;s drummer at a warm-up show at Pappy &amp; Harriet&#x27;s Palace, California.

On January 8, 2025, Shawn Crahan revealed that the new album is in the works in an interview at Knotfest.

==Artistry==
===Musical style===
Slipknot is most often considered a nu metal and alternative metal band, or heavy metal in general. They have included elements of groove metal, death metal, hard rock, grindcore, thrash metal, metalcore, and rap metal. The album &quot;All Hope Is Gone&quot; is considered a groove metal album with elements of death metal and thrash metal.

The band&#x27;s members prefer to distance themselves musically from other nu metal bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Slipknot describes its sound as &quot;metal metal&quot; and regards the link to nu metal as coincidental and a result of nu metal&#x27;s emergence being concurrent with that of Slipknot. The band&#x27;s sound typically features a heavily down-tuned guitar setup, a large percussive section, sampling, keyboards and DJing/turntablism. Using a variety of vocal styles, the music typically features growled vocals, screaming, backing vocals, as well as melodic singing. The band has continually experimented with its sound, most notably developing tracks led by acoustic guitars and melodic singing that first appeared on &quot;Vol. 3 (The Subliminal Verses)&quot;.

===Lyrics===
Slipknot&#x27;s lyrics are generally very aggressive; they sometimes include profanity while exploring themes such as darkness, nihilism, anger, disaffection, love, misanthropy, and psychosis. They often draw upon topics including the music industry, politics, personal strife, and reflection, among others. Rick Anderson of Allmusic said, &quot;those lyrics that are discernible are not generally quotable on a family website&quot;. On &quot;Vol. 3&quot;, Taylor deliberately avoided using profanity in response to claims he relied on it.

===Influences===

Slipknot cited both Korn&#x27;s self-titled album of 1994 and Limp Bizkit&#x27;s album &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all$&quot; of 1997 as major influences. However, the band&#x27;s biggest influence, both on their image and music, has been singer Mike Patton and his bands Mr. Bungle, Fantômas and Faith No More. Corey Taylor even stated that watching Faith No More perform on the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards saved his life. In an interview in 2000 Patton called the Slipknot members &quot;really nice guys&quot;.

The band Kiss has been a big influence for Slipknot, both musically and image-wise. Several band members have in numerous interviews stated the impact Kiss had on them when growing up. In an interview with Revolver magazine, Joey Jordison said that &quot;I saw Kiss on The Dick Clark Show in like, 1980 or something, and &quot;Kiss Alive!&quot; was the first record of theirs I had. This was back when you bought cassettes or records, and I still have my original cassette copy of it. And I tell you what, it just blew my mind! The cover tells you everything you need to know; it just makes you want to listen to the whole fucking record. And these guys look like fucking demons — you don&#x27;t know when you&#x27;re a kid and you&#x27;re watching them on TV that it&#x27;s just guys in makeup. So yeah, it was inspiring back then. They were a huge influence on me when I was a kid. And that record came out in 1975, so I was always like, &quot;That&#x27;s fucking badass — one of my favorite records of all time came out the year I was born!&quot;. In another interview with Loudwire, he also added that after listening to &quot;Kiss Alive!&quot; for the first, he was &quot;changed forever, and then [he] just became completely engulfed in metal.&quot; Guitarist Mick Thomson revealed in Metal Hammer that Kiss&#x27; &quot;Destroyer&quot; was the first album he ever bought, and when talking about Kiss&#x27; &quot;Alive II&quot;; he stated that &quot;...the artwork on Alive II with Gene&#x27;s sweat running, the blood coming from his face and the make-up running had a profound influence on me. You only have to look at my own band to see how much so.&quot; Vocalist Corey Taylor has stated that Kiss were a huge influence on both him and the rest of the band and he has also covered multiple Kiss songs over the years; both as a solo artist as well as with Stone Sour, in which Slipknot guitarist Jim Root also played at the time.

Many authors single out the massive influence that experimental band Mr. Bungle has had on Slipknot; in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the members of Mr. Bungle donned strange masks (often clown and gimp ones), costumes (including jumpsuits) and hid their identities behind obscure pseudonyms. All of these were major features on their 1991 self-titled album cycle. Their creepy music videos from that record, such as &quot;Travolta&quot; which was banned on MTV, also pointed out at what would be the future image of Slipknot. In the same way, the musical influence of Mr. Bungle is evident in the eclecticism and adventurousness throughout &quot;Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.&quot;, Slipknot&#x27;s first release of 1996, although the band added more metallic elements. A few songs on that album also hint at the eccentric catchiness of Faith No More and other funk metal bands. Mr. Bungle drummer Danny Heifetz heavily influenced Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison.
While Slipknot was making its debut studio release, the entire band attended one of the first shows by avant-garde grindcore supergroup Fantômas-composed of Patton, Slayer&#x27;s Dave Lombardo, Melvins&#x27; Buzz Osborne and Mr. Bungle&#x27;s Trevor Dunn-which greatly influenced them at the time. From that 
album on, Slipknot has displayed a much more straightforward, extreme metal sound, largely because of producer Ross Robinson, and some writers have identified the influence of Faith No More on some tracks&#x27; 
structures and alternating melodies from &quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)&quot;. On the other hand, the experimental imprint of Bungle has become rare, but it made a sudden reappearance on 2019&#x27;s &quot;We Are Not Your Kind&quot;.

The members of Slipknot are also influenced by 1960s and 1970s hard rock and early metal acts including Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Jimi Hendrix, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Queen, the late 1970s and early 1980s new wave of British heavy metal bands Iron Maiden, 1980s American thrash metal bands including Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica, Metal Church, Slayer, bands from the 1990s groove metal movement including Pantera, Sepultura, White Zombie, the sludge metal bands such as Acid Bath, The Melvins, Neurosis, as well as various black and death metal acts including Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Dimmu Borgir, Emperor, Gorefest, Malevolent Creation, Mayhem, Morbid Angel. In addition the punk and new wave bands Black Flag, The Clash, Dead Kennedys, Misfits, the Police, 1990s grunge and alternative rock bands Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, the early hip hop acts such as the Beastie Boys, N.W.A, Run-DMC, and the industrial rock acts Nine Inch Nails, Skinny Puppy, have also been cited as influences by the members. Taylor has spoken of his admiration for vocalists Freddie Mercury, Bruce Dickinson, David Lee Roth, Bruce Springsteen and James Hetfield. In 1999, Chris Fehn said Sid Wilson is influenced by jungle music and rave music.

On &quot;The End, So Far&quot; Corey Taylor also cited The Cure, Death, the Prodigy and Type O Negative as inspirations for the album.

===Stage performances===
Slipknot is known for its chaotic, energetic live shows that contributed to the band&#x27;s success. During performances, most of the band&#x27;s members headbang heavily. The band&#x27;s early performances included extreme acts such as stage dives from high balconies and band members setting each other on fire. Clown was known to go into the crowd and tie people up with the microphone cord. In later years, they tended to refrain from acts this extreme. Former bassist Paul Gray said this was due to receiving lawsuits and to avoid harming other people, and that it was a &quot;better move&quot; for the longevity of the band. Along with the energetic and unpredictable performances, Slipknot often use elaborate stage setups that use pyrotechnics, elevated stage areas, hydraulic drum risers, and computer screens. Reviewing a Slipknot performance, Alistair Lawrence of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; said, &quot;the choreographed chaos is too multi-faceted to fully describe&quot;. and &quot;NME&quot; described one Slipknot show as &quot;a scene of chaos&quot;. At their inaugural 2022 show, the band paid tribute to fellow metal band Jinjer and mentioned the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine as cause for their absence.

==Image and identities==
The band is known for its attention-grabbing image; the members perform wearing unique, individual facemasks and matching uniforms—typically jumpsuits—while each member is typically assigned and referred to by number based on their role in the band (#0 through #8), although the latter practice has diminished following the death of Paul Gray.

The band has said the idea of wearing masks stemmed from a clown mask that Crahan took to rehearsals when the band first started. Crahan later became known for his clown masks, adopting the pseudonym &quot;Clown&quot;. The concept developed; by late 1997, the band decided every band member would wear a unique mask and matching jumpsuit. Taylor said in 2002, &quot;it&#x27;s our way of becoming more intimate with the music. It&#x27;s a way for us to become unconscious of who we are and what we do outside of music. It&#x27;s a way for us to kind of crawl inside it and be able to use it.&quot; The concept of wearing matching jumpsuits has been described as a response to commercialism in the music industry and led to the idea of assigning the band members numerical aliases. According to Taylor, &quot;Originally, we were just going to wear the jumpsuits ... we figured we might as well take that further and number ourselves ... We were basically saying, &#x27;Hey, we&#x27;re a product!&#x27;&quot;.

During their careers, the members of Slipknot have developed their images, updating their uniforms and each member&#x27;s mask upon the release of each album. The appearance and style of the masks do not usually differ significantly between albums; members typically maintain the established theme of their mask while adding new elements. Jordison, in an interview in 2004, said the masks are updated to show growth within each individual. Slipknot&#x27;s members have worn special masks for specific occasions, most notably for the music video and live performances of &quot;Vermilion&quot; in 2004 and 2005 when they wore life masks made from casts of their own faces. In 2008, the band wore a set of large masks titled &quot;purgatory masks&quot; during photograph shoots before the release of &quot;All Hope Is Gone&quot;; in the music video for &quot;Psychosocial&quot; they are seen burning them. Shortly after its inception, Slipknot&#x27;s masks were homemade, but since 2000 they have been custom-made by special effect artist and musician Screaming Mad George.

The band&#x27;s image has been the subject of much criticism and controversy, with critics generally accusing it of being a sales gimmick. The band&#x27;s members object to these claims; according to them the masks are used to divert attention from themselves and put it on the music. Several band members have said wearing the masks helps to maintain privacy in their personal lives. During an interview in 2005, percussionist Fehn said the masks were a &quot;blessing&quot; because they meant the members are not recognized in public.

In 2012, Slipknot released an app for iOS and Android called &quot;Slipknot: Wear the Mask&quot;, which invites fans to construct their own masks, defining the kind of Slipknot fans they are.

The band&#x27;s logo, the nonagram, was created by the band&#x27;s members early on.

==Legacy==
Slipknot has inspired artists including Deafheaven, Code Orange, Knocked Loose, vein.fm, Ho99o9, City Morgue, Demon Hunter, Cane Hill, Of Mice &amp; Men, Suicide Silence, Whitechapel, Poorstacy, Loathe, Blood Youth, Bad Omens, Sleep Token, Slaughter to Prevail, Infant Annihilator, and Asking Alexandria.

==Clothing brand==

In 2008, Slipknot launched their clothing line &quot;Tattered and Torn&quot;. Named after a song on their 1999 self-titled debut, the line runs as an imprint of Bravado, a company that runs the band&#x27;s merchandising. While the band recognize that their merchandise is their biggest revenue income, they insist Tattered and Torn is more than just band merchandising. Vocalist Corey Taylor said, &quot;It&#x27;s a way for [the fans] to get cool clothing at affordable prices.&quot; The first items from the clothing line went on sale in late July 2008 through Hot Topic stores across North America and the Hot Topic website. Currently, the line is limited to shirts and hoodies but was expected to develop into a full-range clothing line.

==Controversies==
Slipknot&#x27;s music and image have been the subject of many controversies throughout its career. The lyrical content of some of Slipknot&#x27;s songs has been linked to several violent and criminal incidents. In 2003, two young killers blamed the lyrics of &quot;Disasterpiece&quot; for their crime. In 2006, the lyrics of &quot;Surfacing&quot; were found at the site of a grave robbery.

Slipknot&#x27;s 2005 lawsuit against Burger King said the company created the advertising-based band Coq Roq to capitalize on Slipknot&#x27;s image. Burger King responded with a countersuit, saying many other bands, such as Mr. Bungle, Mushroomhead, Mudvayne, Kiss, Insane Clown Posse, and Gwar have used masks as part of their images. After negotiations, the advertising campaign and lawsuit were withdrawn.

In 2008, Corey Taylor commented on a slashing incident at a South African school to which Slipknot was linked; he said: ... obviously, I&#x27;m disturbed by the fact that people were hurt and someone died, as far as my responsibility for that goes, it stops there, because I know our message is actually very positive ... there are always going to be mental disorders and people who cause violence for no other reason than the fact that they&#x27;re fucked up and lost.

==Feuds==
===Mushroomhead===
Slipknot had a longstanding feud with the band Mushroomhead which—along with their fans—said Slipknot &quot;stole their image&quot;. While Slipknot acknowledged their images had similarities, its members were not actively involved in the feud, saying the similarities were coincidental. Taylor said, &quot;we both started at the same time—neither one of us knowing anything about each other&quot;. Taylor also said that at a live show in Cleveland, Ohio, several Mushroomhead fans threw objects including a fist-sized padlock at Slipknot and that when Slipknot&#x27;s set was finished, Machine Head and Amen went into the crowd and &quot;handled it right there&quot;. In 2009, former Mushroomhead vocalist Waylon Reavis said his band&#x27;s members were no longer interested in feuding with Slipknot, saying, &quot;they&#x27;re not the first masked band, we&#x27;re not, no one was&quot;. During an interview with Rock Rage Radio, Reavis praised Slipknot as he criticized his former bandmates after a dispute with the band&#x27;s founding members which led to his dismissal. He stated that Slipknot was better and he admitted that his thoughts were personal, since he was not involved with Mushroomhead when the feud started.

===Limp Bizkit===
While on tour promoting anticipation for the release of their self-titled album in the spring of 1999; Taylor had taken notice of Korn drummer David Silveria in a promotional campaign for Calvin Klein at multiple truck stop kiosks. Taylor had expressed his disgust with the campaign, and had taken numerous copies of the magazine issues and burned them onstage during multiple live performances. Within hearing of the gesture; Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst (who was a friend of Silveria&#x27;s), took offense at Taylor&#x27;s actions. Durst would later make retaliatory comments towards Slipknot&#x27;s fans in June 1999, referring to them as &quot;fat, ugly kids&quot;. Slipknot singer Corey Taylor responded during an appearance in Sydney by claiming that the fans of Slipknot &quot;for the most part, enjoy all kinds of music, like Limp Bizkit… maybe.&quot; Taylor went on to claim that insulting fans of Slipknot could also be insulting fans of Limp Bizkit. Despite the initial attacks between the two bands, they shared numerous UK festival dates together through 2000, including the 2000 Reading and Leeds Festivals. Durst later praised Slipknot&#x27;s music during an October 2000 interview, though Taylor later criticized his artistic direction, claiming &quot;Fred Durst is a great businessman, but he is not an artist&quot;.

Taylor and Durst would find themselves on friendlier terms in 2010, while recording the album &quot;Gold Cobra&quot;; Durst included a line on the song &quot;90.2.10&quot; giving a shout out to Taylor. According to Taylor during a live interview in 2011; Durst’s children were allegedly fans of Slipknot. Limp Bizkit was later booked on the 2014 Japanese leg of the Knotfest tour along with Korn.

In 2021, following Jordison&#x27;s death, Limp Bizkit paid tribute to him at one of their shows in Iowa.

<text>Woodford County is a county located in the state of Illinois. The 2020 United States census listed its population at 38,467. Its county seat is Eureka. Woodford County is part of the Peoria metropolitan area. Its name comes from General William Woodford, an officer of the American Revolutionary War who served at the brutal military encampment at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.

==History==
===Establishment===
Woodford County is part of what was formerly the homelands of several Native American peoples, including the Potawatomi, the Meskwaki, and the Sauk peoples. It was located just south of the land of the Illiniwek. The western portion of the county in particular shows much archeological evidence of having supported extensive First Nations populations.

At the time of the American Revolutionary War, three competing American colonies – Massachusetts, Virginia, and Connecticut – claimed part of what is today the state of Illinois. The matter was solved in 1778 when Virginia amalgamated lands in the region into a massive county called Illinois, borrowing the name of a native people. Indiana Territory was formed in 1800 with William Henry Harrison as Governor; the future Illinois was part of this territory. It was not until 1809 that Illinois Territory was formally established as an official territory of the United States of America. Statehood followed in December 1818.

The first organized Anglo settlements in the future Woodford County region appeared in the 1820s. First settlement in the county came at Spring Bay, with pioneers managing to select the same ground occupied by an ancient Indian burial site which ran north-and-south through the entire settlement. The location was chosen due to its proximity to the Illinois River.

In the 1870s, an early historian of Woodford County wrote:

There were a few Indians in the county at the time of settlement by the whites, but the two races did not come into conflict to any extent. The advancing wave of civilization seemed to follow up the retreating wave of barbarism. The first settlers encountered a few Indians ... and in 1832 were involved to some extent in the Black Hawk War, but the active operations were further north than Woodford County.

The current boundaries of the county were not those originally drawn; moreover, the names of various counties in the region changed frequently The Eastern portion of Woodford County was known as Edwards (1814–16), Crawford (1816–19), Clark (1819–21), and Fayette (1821-25) Counties, while the Western part of today&#x27;s county was included in Madison (1814–17), Bond (1817–21), and Sangamon (1821–25) Counties.

In 1827 new lines were drawn and Tazewell County was established, including all of today&#x27;s Woodford County. Settlers began arriving from neighboring territories during the early 1830s. This led to the formal creation of Woodford County along its current boundaries in February 1841 from a portion of Tazewell County and a portion of McLean County that had been part of Tazewell County before 1830.

The county was named for Woodford County, Kentucky, which was in turn named after General William Woodford, who served with General George Washington at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania during the brutal winter of 1777–78.

The first post office in today&#x27;s Woodford County was established in 1836 at Partridge township, named for local tribal leader Black Partridge. Also in 1836, the area&#x27;s first (private) school was founded, by Miss Betsy Page. The first public school followed shortly thereafter. The first Sunday school was established in 1837 in the home of Parker Morse in Cazenovia.

===Pioneer life===

The first settlers of Woodford County occupied crude log cabins. Windows were covered with oiled papers; doors and floors were constructed of rough boards split from trees and held together with wooden pegs. Construction of the cabins was primitive, with the floor plan generally involving a single room heated with a fireplace.

Meat was frequently roasted on a spit; cornbread was generally baked on the fireplace coals. A common staple of pioneer life was waffles, baked from batter in a folding iron mold three or four feet long. Modern canning processes were unknown and the wintertime larder consisted primarily of bread and meat. Vegetables were consumed seasonally, with pumpkin, red peppers, corn, and venison dried for later use.

Clothing was made at home, generally of linen made from homegrown flax. In addition, other heavier compound fabrics known as &quot;linsey,&quot; made of linen or cotton with woolen filling, and &quot;jeans,&quot; made of an even heavier material and dyed brown with walnut bark, were also used.

Prior to 1831 all preparation of wool had to be done by hand at home, with the raw fiber &quot;carded&quot; between pairs of thin, metal spiked boards about 4 inches wide and a foot long. The resulting rolls of wool were then spun into thread upon a spinning wheel and thereby prepared for the loom.

A sexual division of labor was practiced, with women engaged in home manufactures and food preparation while men were occupied with agriculture, hunting, and construction. Since a great percentage of the land of Woodford County was tillable, farming was the principal occupation of the early settlers. Plowing was by means of wooden plows with iron shares; corn was planted by hand and covered using a hoe. Hay, often using wild rather than cultivated grass, was cut with a scythe and taken up with rakes and pitchforks.

With the advent of timber milling in the area, frame houses became possible. Settlers cooperated in construction, helping one another raise houses and barns. The latter could be 30 feet in length and width with walls perhaps 16 feet high. &quot;It was heavy and dangerous work, and the raising of a large barn required the united energies of a whole community,&quot; one settler recalled. Other buildings commonly constructed included stables, corn-cribs, smokehouses, and ash-hoppers. Plank fences began to appear in the 1850s.

Governance by the early settlers was not by secret ballot, but by voice vote.

===Antebellum years===

By 1850, Woodford County was well settled; county&#x27;s population topped the 5,000 mark. Illinois settlers were overwhelmingly opposed to the institution of slavery, and with the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, popular discontent grew and opponents began to engage in acts of resistance, hiding escaped slaves seeking escape to Canada. One branch of the so-called Underground Railroad along which escaped slaves furtively avoided their potential captors ran directly through Woodford County.

The &quot;stations&quot; of the Underground Railroad were generally residences where escaping slaves could hide from their pursuers. These stations were located at convenient distances so that those escaping (and their &quot;conductor&quot; guides) could travel from one to the next in a single night.

The journey was dangerous. Wanted posters offering rewards of $50, $100, and sometimes more for specific runaway slaves were placed by slaveowners, attracting bounty hunters. Moreover, those assisting escaping slaves were themselves violators of the Fugitive Slave Law, subject to prosecution and punishment.

Local historian Roy L. Moore wrote:

There was bitter opposition to the enforcement of the fugitive slave law. This condition was not surprising, since the county had men who were strong opponents of slavery and likewise men who would make any sacrifice to have the institution stamped out. Over this branch of the underground road many a runaway slave passed on his way to freedom. There was such a strong sentiment against the [slave] traffic that conductors and stations were found in sufficient number to carry on the work successfully.

Church deacons named Mr. Dutton and Parker Morse were credited by Moore as leaders of the local anti-slavery effort. Despite the fact that these and other active conductors in the Underground Railroad were known to the community, popular sentiment against slavery was such that there was &quot;very little molestation for a long time&quot; in Woodford County. Only one instance of an arrest of a Woodford County conductor is recorded by Roy Moore in his 1910 history, and that ultimately resulted in the quashing of the indictment.

===Early administrative structure===

When it was first established in 1841, the county seat of Woodford County was placed in Versailles for a temporary two-year interval. Competition for the honor (and related business opportunities) was fierce leading up to the June 1843 decision of the county commissioners to tap Metamora (then known as Hanover) as the new seat. A county courthouse was begun in Metamora in 1844 and a county jail in March 1852.

It was during the pre-Civil War years that Woodford County adopted townships – which was met with strong opposition. No fewer than four public elections were held between 1850 and 1854 before the township system gained a majority of votes.

Following the division of the county into townships in early 1855, the system of county government was likewise altered, with a county commission giving way to a board of supervisors. Early county officers, including the sheriff, coroner, school commissioner, surveyor, and treasurer were elected to two-year terms of office, later changed to four-year terms.

Other claimants arose attempting to wrest the county seat from Metamora, including Eureka, El Paso, and Roanoke. El Paso was nearly awarded the seat in 1867, when it sent a local attorney to make an offer of $30,000 to the town of Metamora to relinquish the county seat. A closely contested vote ended with the apparent result in favor of El Paso reversed by a bare 10 votes in a recount.

Another vote in 1869 rejected an appeal to move the county seat to Eureka. A dubious recount in a third election held in November 1873 again overturned an apparent result to move the Woodford County seat to Roanoke. A fourth election in 1884, again proposing relocation to Roanoke, failed miserably. It was only in 1894 when a final election provided a decisive majority in favor of moving the county seat to Eureka that Metamora lost its status as county seat.

An impressive new courthouse building was quickly constructed in Eureka, cementing that town&#x27;s status as legal and governmental center of Woodford County.

===Civil War years===

Woodford County&#x27;s population continued to swell, standing at 13,281 when the American Civil War started in 1861. Support for the Union Cause was strong throughout the county; by war&#x27;s end 1,643 county residents had enlisted in the Union forces – 12.4% of the population.

Calls for troops were translated into state quotas, which in Illinois was customarily apportioned to the various counties according to their population. Enlistment bonuses were paid. After 1862 when the number of volunteers ultimately failed to fulfill a state&#x27;s enlistment quota, a draft was begun. Substitutes for those drafted could be sent, with prices paid by the draftee to his substitute generally ranging of $500 to $600, although prices of up to $1,000 were reportedly paid.

Woodford County&#x27;s volunteers – and later on conscripts – were dispersed among a wide range of units, making a universal summary of their wartime experience impossible. Some units composed largely of residents of Woodford County, including Company G of the 17th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, mustered at Peoria May 25, 1861, and fought at the Battle of Shiloh in Hardin County, Tennessee in April 1862. Several Woodford County men were among the 130 members of the 17th Infantry killed and wounded in the two-day battle. This unit also participated in the last phase of the 1863 Siege of Vicksburg in Warren County, Mississippi, a protracted battle which led to the surrender of over 29,000 Confederate troops.

Another unit containing numerous Woodford County men was the 47th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, especially Companies B and I. Mustered into service at Peoria on August 16, 1861, the unit lost 30 killed and 100 wounded in the Battle of Corinth, Mississippi, in October 1862. The unit also suffered casualties in a May 1863 charge during the Vicksburg Campaign. After the fall of Vicksburg in July 1863, the unit spent the duration guarding railroad lines, being discharged in October of that year.

The 77th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, Companies C, F and H, also had a substantial Woodford County contingent. Serving under Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger, they participated in the initial phase of the Vicksburg Campaign. The 77th then participated in the Battle of Jackson, Mississippi (May 1863), and taking the city. Disaster struck in April 1864 near Alexandria, Louisiana, when the unit was isolated and crushed in a cavalry support operation at the Battle of Sabine Cross-roads. 176 men of the 77th Illinois were killed, wounded, or captured, leaving only 125 members of the regiment fit for duty. The unit was mustered out in July 1865, having participated in 16 battles.

Woodford County men served in numbers in Company A, 86th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, suffering losses in Kentucky at the Battle of Perryville in October 1862, and participating in Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea. Others were concentrated in Companies D and E of the 108th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, in which 205 of the 214 fatalities suffered by the regiment were due to disease rather than combat, 134 of whom died in February and March 1863 alone.

===Eureka College===
A leading community institution of Woodford County for more than 150 years is Eureka College, a liberal arts school affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Its most noted alumnus is US President Ronald Reagan.

Eureka College traces its roots back to the summer of 1848, when a young collegian named A.S. Fisher appeared in Walnut Grove (original name of Eureka) and expressed his interest in conducting a school that would teach language, science, mathematics, and philosophy. Fisher was employed to teach school for ten months, with a number of local worthies, including many active in the Church of Christ, guaranteeing payment of his salary. This school was formally launched in September 1848. Owing to the presence of a charismatic local religious leader, the Church of Christ showed great growth during this period, adding 100 adherents in 1848, with other supporters in neighboring counties. Demand grew for transformation of the school into a seminary with room and board for students from other localities, with instructional costs to be covered through collection of tuition. In September 1849, the school was rechristened Walnut Grove Seminary and relaunched with A.S. Fisher as principal, assisted by a young woman &quot;of superior ability and tact as a teacher.&quot; Fisher would ultimately spend 38 years associated with the college which would emerge.

In December 1849 the school was incorporated as Walnut Grove Academy. Money was collected for an expansion of the facility and a new two-story building constructed. The enterprise continued to expand and planning began for expansion of the academy into a college, with necessary buildings and a library. Appeals were made to the state Missionary Convention of the Church of Christ in 1851 and enthusiasm for establishment of a college within the church laity grew.

==History==
Winnebago County was formed on January 16, 1836, out of Jo Daviess and LaSalle counties. It was named for the Winnebago Tribe of American Indians. At the time the county was founded its inhabitants consisted almost entirely of New Englanders and New England transplants from upstate New York. These were &quot;Yankee&quot; settlers, meaning they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England during the early 1600s. They made up virtually all of Winnebago County&#x27;s inhabitants during the first several decades of its history. In this regard the county was similar to most of the northern portion of the state of Illinois, and almost all of the neighboring state of Wisconsin. After the conclusion of the Black Hawk War there was an additional surge of immigration from New England. As a result of this heritage the inhabitants of Winnebago County considered themselves, and functioned as, a cultural expansion of early New England culture. In the presidential election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln won 3,985 votes in Winnebago County, whereas Stephen A. Douglas only won 817 votes.

==Politics==
For many years, Winnebago County was rather conservative for an urban county. From the 1850s to 1988, it backed the Republican candidates for president at every election except the national Democratic landslides of 1936 and 1964. In the 1990s, it became a swing county, backing the national winner in every presidential election from 1992 to 2012, though only three did so with a majority and only once by more than six percentage points. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the county by only 89 votes over Donald Trump, affected by the relatively large third-party vote that year.

Underlining how Republican Winnebago County once was, only three Democrats have represented a significant portion of the county in Congress since the 1850s.

<text>Williamson County is a county in Southern Illinois. At the 2020 census, it had a population of 67,153. The largest city and county seat is Marion. Williamson County is included in the Carbondale-Marion, IL Metropolitan Statistical Area. This area of Southern Illinois is known locally as &quot;Little Egypt&quot;. Williamson is in the Metro Lakeland area, southeast of St. Louis, Missouri. Via the nearby intersection of Interstates 57 and 24, and Illinois Route 13, a primary east–west four-lane expressway, the city has access to the major communities of Murphysboro, Carbondale, Carterville, Herrin, Marion and Harrisburg. The Metro Lakeland area of Jackson-Williamson counties has a total of 120,000 residents. Carbondale (14 miles west), Herrin and Marion are the key urban areas in Metro Lakeland, with a combined population of more than 65,000. Over 235,000 people live within .

==History==
Williamson County was formed from Franklin County on February 28, 1839, and was named for Williamson County, Tennessee. Many of its settlers were from the Uplands South, traveling via the Ohio River from Kentucky and Virginia.

It became a center of coal mining, attracting numerous European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Labor tensions rose as workers sought to unionize and improve their wages and conditions. Mine owners resisted and several episodes of violence resulted during strikes and other work actions. resulted in several episodes of violence. Williamson County is often referred to as &quot;Bloody Williamson,&quot; due to several outbreaks of violence that have few parallels in American history.

These include the Bloody Vendetta (1876), armed confrontation between families and associates during the waning days of Reconstruction; the Carterville Massacre (1899), a Coal Strike (1906), the Herrin Massacre (1922), the Klan War (1924–1926), and the Birger/Shelton Gang War (1926). 

During the so-called Klan War, a mob of perhaps 1,300 men were deputized by the local sheriff. Starting on February 1, 1924, the posse began raiding the homes of local mine workers, mostly Italian immigrants. The Klan was inspired by both nativist and Prohibitionist fervor. Violence continued sporadically between bootleggers and the Klan. Twenty people were killed before peace was restored.

In June 1915, a Sicilian miner accused of the fatal shooting of a wealthy local resident was lynched in Johnston City, Illinois by a mob. The Illinois National Guard was deployed to prevent rioting between the miner&#x27;s supporters and opponents. They were also later ordered to various locations repeatedly during the 1920s to separate warring parties and attempt to keep order.

The northwest section of the county suffered extensive damage during the Tri-State Tornado of 1925. The county was also struck by two tornadoes on May 29, 1982, which killed 10 people in the Marion, Illinois tornado outbreak. On May 8, 2009, the cities of Carterville, Herrin, and Marion were severely damaged by the May 2009 Southern Midwest derecho.

Williamson County lies on the border between humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa&quot;) and humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;), with neither large mountains nor large bodies of water to moderate its temperature.

Summers are hot and humid, with only occasional and brief respite, and the humidity often makes the heat index rise to temperatures feeling well above . Fall is mild with lower humidity and can produce intermittent bouts of heavy rainfall, with the first snow flurries usually forming in late November. Winters are cold with periodic snow and temperatures often below freezing; however, thaws are usually frequent. Winter storm systems, such as Alberta clippers and Panhandle hooks, can bring days of heavy freezing rain, ice pellets, and snowfall.

The normal high temperature in July is , and the normal low temperature in January is , although this varies from year to year. Both temperatures can be seen on an average 2 or 3 days per year. In recent years, average temperatures have ranged from a low of in January to a high of in July, although a record low of was recorded in January 1977 and a record high of was recorded in August 1977. Average monthly precipitation ranged from in October to in May.

Williamson County has thunderstorms about 50 days a year on average. Thunderstorms contribute over half of the annual precipitation. Especially in the spring, these storms can often be severe, with high winds, large hail and tornadoes.

Some late autumns feature the warm weather known as Indian summer; some years see roses in bloom as late as early December.

==Politics==












Whiteside County has a political history typical of Northern Illinois. Between its first election in 1840, and 1852, it always favored the Whig Party, and although Whiteside was not as strong for the Free Soil Party as counties to the east like Boone and Lake, it gave substantial votes to that party in 1848 and 1852 and became powerfully Republican for the next century-and-a-quarter. Between 1856 and 1988 the only time Whiteside County did not vote for the Republican candidate was in 1912, when the GOP was mortally divided and Whiteside County voted for Progressive Party nominee and former President Theodore Roosevelt by a 2-to-1 margin over conservative incumbent William Howard Taft. Between at least 1880 and 1960, no Democratic presidential nominee ever won 40 percent of Whiteside County&#x27;s vote, and even Alf Landon in 1936 carried the county by 22 percent when losing 46 of 48 states.

In 1964 the Republican Party nominated Barry Goldwater, whose hostility to the Yankee establishment and strongly conservative policies were sufficient to leave many traditional Republicans to stay home or even to vote for Lyndon Johnson. In this climate, Goldwater managed to keep the Republican Party&#x27;s winning streak in Whiteside alive, but by just 1.6%, or 404 votes.

The county continued to vote comfortably more Republican than the nation for the next four elections. However, it began trending away from the GOP in 1984, as its most famous native, Ronald Reagan, successfully sought a second term. Even as Reagan increased his national margin by over 8%, his margin in Whiteside was more than halved, from a little over 40% in 1980 to 19.6% in 1984. The county was only marginally more Republican than the nation in 1984. The trend continued in 1988, as George H. W. Bush carried it by 6.8%, a somewhat smaller margin than he won the national popular vote by, making this election the first one in which Whiteside voted more Democratic than the nation in at least a century. In 1992, it gave Bill Clinton a plurality win, with a comfortable 8.0% margin over George H. W. Bush. In 1996, the county gave Bill Clinton an outright majority. The county went on to vote Democratic for the next four consecutive elections, giving Gore, Kerry, and Obama four straight majorities.

However, in 2016, concerns over long-term economic decline saw much of the Rust Belt swing heavily towards Donald Trump, and Whiteside flipped from a 16.9% Obama win in 2012 to a Trump plurality in 2016. In 2020, Trump won a majority—the first for a Republican since 1988—and increased his margin from 6.2% to 8.3%.

<text>White County is a county located in the U.S. state of Illinois. According to the 2020 census, it had a population of 13,877. Its county seat is Carmi. It is located in the southern portion of Illinois known locally as &quot;Little Egypt&quot;.

==History==
White County was organized from Gallatin County in 1815, and was named after Captain Leonard White, a Gallatin County legislator who is credited with the idea of extending the Illinois-Wisconsin border a few miles north of the southern tip of Lake Michigan. He was killed in 1811 at the Battle of Tippecanoe. The county seat, Carmi, was founded in 1814, and incorporated in 1816. The first courthouse was in the log cabin of John Craw.

The first white settlers came to White County between 1807 and 1809. The first settlements were near the Little Wabash River and Big Prairie, one of the numerous prairies in the county. These families—Hanna, Land, Hay, Williams, Calvert, Ratcliff, Holderby, Robinson, Stewart, among others—typically had spent time in the Carolinas, Kentucky or Tennessee before moving into Illinois, and most were of Scots-Irish descent. Many came through the land office at Shawneetown, Illinois, which was a port for flatboats which traveled the Ohio River.

Other early settlements were Grayville, located at the mouth of Bonpas Creek and the Wabash River, settled by the Gray family around 1810; Phillipstown, on the bluffs above the Wabash and Fox River floodplain; and New Haven (mostly in Gallatin County), which was home to a brother of Daniel Boone around 1818. Old Sharon Church (Presbyterian), located near the later village of Sacramento, was organized around 1816, and the village of Seven Mile Prairie was established a few miles north of the church in the 1830s. The parents of longtime Abraham Lincoln girlfriend Ann Rutledge were part of this group, along with families named McArthy, Miller, McClellan, Pollard, Storey, Fields, and Johnson.

About 1839, a group of Irish immigrants began moving into the extreme western part of Enfield Township, led by Patrick Dolan, as well as members of the Mitchell and Dunn clans. Dolan was auctioneer in 1853 when the village of Enfield was platted, as Seven Mile moved west in anticipation of a railroad line, which was not built until 1872. German families moved into the middle portion of the county in the 1840s and onward, especially from the Baden region, and included the family names of Rebstock, Dartt, Brown, Sailer, Stanley, and Drone.

The second half of the 19th century saw the establishment of the towns of Norris City, Springerton, Mill Shoals (once the home of a thriving barrel-making industry which depleted the nearby virgin forests), Epworth, Herald, Burnt Prairie (previously known as &quot;Liberty&quot;), Crossville, Phillipstown, Concord (also known as Emma), Maunie and Rising Sun (commonly called Dogtown)--the latter two villages are located on the Wabash and attracted several African-American families. A number of villages which no longer exist were also formed: Trumbull, Roland, Middle Point, Stokes Station, Gossett, Bungay, Calvin, Iron, and Dolan Settlement.

In 1925, White County was the last of five Illinois counties affected by the infamous Tri-State Tornado. Although the storm spared the towns of Carmi, Enfield and Crossville, significant damage was done to the surrounding rural areas, where 28 people were killed, dozens were injured and scores of homes and farms were destroyed.

Agriculture was the primary industry of White County until the summer of 1939, when oil was discovered in the Storms and Stinson fields in the Wabash River Bottoms. The population of Carmi doubled within two years, from 2,700 to 5,400, with corresponding increases at Crossville and Grayville—in 1940 it was said one could walk between these two towns by simply walking from rig to rig. Many of these workers migrated from previous oil booms in Texas and Oklahoma. As of 2013, fracking is underway near Carmi.

The current population of White County is a little over 17,000, with 6,500 in the county seat of Carmi. There is a high number of retired people, and many citizens work in the factories of Evansville or Mount Vernon, Indiana, located 45 and 25 miles to the east, respectively. Besides oil and agriculture, industries include auto parts manufacturing, plastics, a convenience store distribution center and underground coal mining.

Due to legal actions enforced by Indiana courts, White County, Illinois was also the site of the ill-fated Erie Canal Soda Pop Festival also known as the Bull Island Fest in 1972. Three county sheriffs were the only police force present at the festival.

<text>Wabash County is a county located in the U.S. state of Illinois. According to the 2020 census, it had a population of 11,361. Its county seat is Mount Carmel. It is located in the southern portion of Illinois known locally as &quot;Little Egypt&quot;.

==History==
Wabash County was formed in 1824 out of Edwards County. This averted to an armed confrontation between the militias of Albion and Mt. Carmel after the county seat was moved from a town near the current city of Mount Carmel to Albion.

The county is named for the Wabash River, which forms its eastern and southern borders. The name &quot;Wabash&quot; is an English spelling of the French name for the river, &quot;Ouabache.&quot;&#x27; French traders named the river after the Miami Indian word for the river, &quot;Wabashike,&quot; (pronounced &quot;Wah-bah-she-keh&quot;), the word for &quot;pure white.&quot; Much of the river bottom is white limestone, now obscured by mud.
A remnant of the county&#x27;s original Eastern Woodlands ecosystem can be found in the &quot;Forest of the Wabash&quot;, located within the county&#x27;s Beall Woods State Park.

In the 1920s a notable hotel and resort operated in Wabash County nearby the Grand Rapids Dam on the Wabash River. Named the Grand Rapids Hotel, it was owned by Frederick Hinde Zimmerman.

<doc id="96161" wikidata="Q484273" url="?curid=96161" title="Vermilion County, Illinois">
<text>Vermilion County is a county in the eastern part of the U.S. state of Illinois, between the Indiana border and Champaign County. It was established in 1826 and was the 45th of Illinois&#x27; 102 counties. According to the 2020 United States census, it had a population of 74,188. It contains 21 incorporated settlements; the county seat and largest city is Danville.

Vermilion County is part of the Danville, IL Micropolitan Statistical Area, as well as the larger Champaign–Urbana–Danville Combined Statistical Area.

==History==

Vermilion County is named after the Vermilion River, which passes through the county and empties into the Wabash River in Indiana near Cayuga; the river was so named because of the color of the earth along its route.

The area which became Vermilion County was under the flag of France from 1682 to 1763, as part of New France.

It was taken over by Great Britain for fifteen years after the French and Indian War; it then became part of the colonies after the Revolutionary War when the area was ceded to Virginia, titled &quot;the Illinois County of Virginia&quot;. Later it was part of the Indiana Territory, then the Illinois Territory, and finally the state of Illinois. The county was created on January 18, 1826, from a portion of Edgar County. There was an unorganized territory to the north and west which was attached to the county; Champaign and Iroquois counties were formed from part of this territory in 1833. The remainder was used to create Ford County in 1859, the last Illinois county to be formed.

The county&#x27;s saline springs were a strong attraction to early explorers; they were mentioned as early as 1801. Joseph Barron, an interpreter fluent in several Native American languages, stated in an affidavit that he was present at the &quot;Vermilion Salines&quot; that year. The production required 100 gallons of water for one bushel of salt and proved to be profitable from the first run (1822–1829), when salt became less expensive and the venture was no longer economical.

The area&#x27;s first settlement was made in 1819 near these saline springs, by the Treat, Beckwith, and Whitcomb. James Butler, from Ohio, followed in 1820 and settled in the Catlin area; within a few years, the settlement grew to encompass several families and became known as &quot;Butler&#x27;s Point&quot;. In the southern part of the county, Henry Johnson built a cabin west of present-day Georgetown; this area was known as &quot;Johnson&#x27;s Point&quot;. The southern portion of the county was soon filled with small settlements. Most settlers in Vermilion County came from the American South, who had left because of their opposition to slavery.

Some of the early settlers were of the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers. They founded the settlement of Vermilion Grove in the south part of the county, one of the county&#x27;s first settlements and the site of the county&#x27;s second public school.

The county has strong ties to Abraham Lincoln, who practiced law in Danville from 1841 to 1859 with Ward Hill Lamon; Lamon later served as Lincoln&#x27;s bodyguard. Lincoln spoke in Danville during his 1858 campaign for a seat in the US Senate. Lincoln gave the speech in his stocking feet from the balcony of Dr. William Fithian, a prominent local physician. The Fithian home is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places and serves as the Vermilion County Museum; visitors can see Lincoln memorabilia including a bed in which Lincoln slept.

The various stages in the evolution of Vermilion County are shown below.
==Geography==

* US Route 136, which runs across five states, passes into Vermilion County from the west on its way from Rantoul. It passes east through the towns of Armstrong, Potomac and Henning; it reaches Illinois Route 1 south of Rossville and then shares that highway&#x27;s route as it passes south through Danville. At the south edge of Danville it reaches Main Street and resumes its eastward heading, leaving the east edge of Danville and passing out of the county and state on its way to Covington, Indiana.
* US Route 150 enters the county from Champaign–Urbana to the west, running just to the south of Interstate 74 and passing through the towns of Fithian, Muncie and Oakwood. Just west of Danville it crosses to the north side of Interstate 74 as that highway veers to the southeast. In downtown Danville, it meets Illinois Route 1 and U.S. Route 136, and follows Route 1 to the south and continues through the towns of Belgium, Westville, Georgetown and Ridge Farm before entering Edgar County further to the south.
* Illinois Route 1 runs from the north to the south through the county, passing through Hoopeston, Rossville, Danville, Belgium, Westville, Georgetown and Ridge Farm.
* Illinois Route 9 runs from west to east near the north edge of the county and passes through Rankin and Hoopeston; upon reaching the Indiana border
* Indiana State Road 26 continues its route to the east toward Lafayette, Indiana.
* Illinois Route 49 is a north–south highway near the western edge of the county. It passes south through Rankin where it intersects Route 9; further south it passes near Armstrong where U.S. Route 136 briefly shares its route. Crossing Interstate 74, it shares the route of U.S. Route 150, running west for about and leaving the county before continuing south in Champaign County.
* Illinois Route 119 is a short east–west road that connects the intersection of Illinois Route 1 and U.S. Route 136 with Indiana State Road 28 at the state line.

Four railroad lines pass through or into the county, all intersecting in the Danville area; this results in many different railroad crossings throughout the city:
* Norfolk Southern Railway line – enters the county from Decatur to the southwest and passes through Danville on its way to Lafayette, Indiana to the northeast
* CSX Transportation line - north-south through the county, connecting Chicago and Terre Haute, Indiana via Paris
* Kankakee, Beaverville and Southern Railroad line – north–south line through the county, to the east of the CSX line, a few miles from the state border, beginning in northern Iroquois County and running south through Danville, then veering east.
* Vermilion Valley Railroad line – a line that connects the Flex-N-Gate factory west of Covington, Indiana with CSX in Danville.

The Vermilion Regional Airport is located northeast of Danville.

The first county seat was in Mackinaw from 1827 to 1836. It was moved temporarily from Mackinaw to Pekin in June 1831, with the county court proceedings in the Snell schoolhouse. It moved to Tremont in 1836. After a political struggle between Tremont and Pekin, the county seat was reassigned to Pekin in 1849.

<text>Stark County is a county in Illinois. According to the 2020 census, it had a population of 5,400. Its county seat is Toulon. Stark County is part of the Peoria, IL Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Stark County was formed in 1839 out of Knox and Putnam counties. It was named for General Colonel John Stark (August 28, 1728 – May 8, 1822), who served in the American Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He became widely known as the &quot;Hero of Bennington&quot; for his exemplary service at the Battle of Bennington in 1777. 
In the latter part of April 1829 a solitary, heavily laden wagon was wending its way from the hospitable home of Mr. French, at Prince&#x27;s Grove, about a half mile north-west of the present town of Princeville, towards Spoon River, probably crossing that stream at a point since known as Boardman&#x27;s Ford, or, as others think, near the seat of Cox&#x27;s Mill, and moving on towards section fifteen in what has since been known as Essex Township.

The weather was warm and balmy considering the season. The prairie burnt over by the Indians in the fall was already green with sprouting grass. Accompanying this vehicle were as it might seem a guard of good men, and true; &quot;neighbors&quot; they called themselves, although they must have lived many miles apart, some of them thirty or forty from the scene of their present friendly labors, having come from LaSalle Prairie, from Chillicothe and Peoria. They were neither hunters or warriors, they feared no enemy, and sought not the &quot;spoils of war&quot;.

It was a peaceable expedition and its leader was the occupant of the wagon, Isaac B. Essex, then in the strength of his manhood, and with him came his young wife and infant child to found a home in the wilderness. The &quot;neighbors&quot; were Daniel Prince, Stephen French, Simon Reed, Frank Thomas and two Baptist ministers, Elders Silliman and Allen. The former of these two was the father of the much respected Toulon townsman Minott Silliman, the first treasurer of Stark county. And these men had come so far to raise a cabin!

Mr. Essex had been out and made a claim in 1828, and in the fall of that year cut the logs and split the clap-boards for his house, probably all of which were on the northeast quarter of section fifteen. They now proceeded to haul them together and get them in shape on the proposed building site. They all camped in the woods the first night, but towards sundown of the second day, the cabin was raised, the roof on, and as Mr. Essex graphically said &quot;we cut a log out and moved in.&quot;

This was emphatically the first pioneer cabin, the first home of non-Native American settlers within the present limits of Stark County.

<text>St. Clair County is the ninth most populous county in Illinois. Located directly east of St. Louis, the county is part of the Metro East region of the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area in southern Illinois. As of the 2020 United States census, St. Clair County had a population of 257,400, making it the third most populous county in Illinois outside the Chicago metropolitan area. Belleville is the county’s seat and largest city. Cahokia Village was founded in 1697 by French settlers and served as a Jesuit mission to convert tribes of the Illinois Confederation to Christianity. Prior to the establishment of Illinois as a state, the government of the Northwest Territory created St. Clair County in 1790 out of the western half of Knox County. In 1809, the county became the administrative center of the Illinois Territory and one of the two original counties of Illinois, alongside Randolph County. In 1970, the United States Census Bureau placed the mean center of U.S. population in St. Clair County.

==History==
This area was occupied for thousands of years by cultures of indigenous peoples. The first modern explorers and colonists of the area were French and French Canadians, founding a mission settlement in 1697 now known as Cahokia Village. After Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1763 and absorbed its territory in North America east of the Mississippi River, British-American colonists began to move into the area. Many French Catholics moved to settlements west of the river rather than live under British Protestant rule.

After the United States achieved independence in the late 18th century, St. Clair County was the first county established in present-day Illinois; it antedates Illinois&#x27; existence as a separate jurisdiction. The county was established in 1790 by a proclamation of Arthur St. Clair, first governor of the Northwest Territory, who named it after himself.

The original boundary of St. Clair county covered a large area between the Mackinaw and Ohio rivers. In 1801, Governor William Henry Harrison re-established St. Clair County as part of the Indiana Territory, extending its northern border to Lake Superior and the international border with Rupert&#x27;s Land.

When the Illinois Territory was created in 1809, Territorial Secretary Nathaniel Pope, in his capacity as acting governor, issued a proclamation establishing St. Clair and Randolph County as the two original counties of Illinois.

Originally developed for agriculture, this area became industrialized and urbanized in the area of East St. Louis, Illinois, a city that developed on the east side of the Mississippi River from St. Louis, Missouri. It was always strongly influenced by actions of businessmen from St. Louis, who were initially French Creole fur traders with western trading networks.

In the 19th century, industrialists from St. Louis put coal plants and other heavy industry on the east side of the river, developing East St. Louis. Coal from southern mines was transported on the river to East St. Louis, then fed by barge to St. Louis furnaces as needed. After bridges spanned the river, industry expanded.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the cities attracted immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and from the South. In 1910 there were 6,000 African Americans in the city. With the Great Migration underway from the rural South, to leave behind Jim Crow and disenfranchisement, by 1917, the African-American population in East St. Louis had doubled. Whites were generally hired first and given higher–paying jobs, but there were still opportunities for American blacks. If hired as strikebreakers, they were resented by white workers, and both groups competed for jobs and limited housing in East St. Louis. The city had not been able to keep up with the rapid growth of population. The United States was developing war industries to support its eventual entry into the Great War, now known as World War I.
In February 1917 tensions in the city arose as white workers struck at the Aluminum Ore Company. Employers fiercely resisted union organizing, sometimes with violence. In this case they hired hundreds of blacks as strikebreakers. White workers complained to the city council about this practice in late May. Rumors circulated about an armed African American man robbing a white man, and whites began to attack blacks on the street. The governor ordered in the National Guard and peace seemed restored by early June.

&quot;On July 1, a white man in a Ford shot into black homes. Armed African-Americans gathered in the area and shot into another oncoming Ford, killing two men who turned out to be police officers investigating the shooting.&quot; Word spread and whites gathered at the Labor Temple; the next day they fanned out across the city, armed with guns, clubs, anything they could use against the blacks they encountered. From July 1 through July 3, 1917, the East St. Louis riots engulfed the city, with whites attacking blacks throughout the city, pulling them from streetcars, shooting and hanging them, burning their houses. During this period, some African Americans tried to swim or use boats to get to safety; thousands crossed the Eads Bridge to St. Louis, seeking refuge, until the police closed it off. The official death toll was 39 blacks and nine whites, but some historians believe more blacks were killed. Because the riots were racial terrorism, the Equal Justice Initiative has included these deaths among the lynchings of African Americans in the state of Illinois in its 2017 3rd edition of its report, &quot;Lynching in America&quot;.

The riots had disrupted East St. Louis, which had seemed to be on the rise as a flourishing industrial city. In addition to the human toll, they cost approximately $400,000 in property damage (over $8 million, in 2017 US Dollars ). They have been described as among the worst labor and race-related riots in United States history, and they devastated the African-American community.

Rebuilding was difficult as workers were being drafted to fight in World War I. When the veterans returned, they struggled to find jobs and re-enter the economy, which had to shift down to peacetime.

In the late 20th century, national restructuring of heavy industry cost many jobs, hollowing out the city, which had a marked decline in population. Residents who did not leave have suffered high rates of poverty and crime. In the early 21st century, East St. Louis is a site of urban decay. Swathes of deteriorated housing were demolished and parts of the city have become urban prairie. In 2017 the city marked the centennial of the riots that had so affected its residents.

Other cities in St. Clair County border agricultural or vacant lands. Unlike the suburbs on the Missouri side of the metro area, those in Metro-East are typically separated by agriculture, or otherwise undeveloped land left after the decline of industry. The central portion of St. Clair county is located on a bluff along the Mississippi River. This area is being developed with suburban housing, particularly in Belleville, and its satellite cities. The eastern and southern portion of the county is sparsely populated. The older small communities and small tracts of newer suburban villages are located between large areas of land devoted to corn and soybean fields, the major commodity crops of the area.

According to the St. Clair County Historical Society, the county flag was designed in 1979 by Kent Zimmerman, a senior at O&#x27;Fallon Township High School. Zimmerman&#x27;s flag won first place in a contest against submissions by more than 40 grade school and high school students from throughout the county. The winning entry features the outline of St. Clair County with an orange moon, a stalk of corn, and a pickaxe against a background of three stripes alternating green, yellow, and green.

==Geography==
According to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.4%) is water.

===Climate and weather===

In recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Belleville have ranged from a low of in January to a high of in July, although a record low of was recorded in January 1977 and a record high of at East St. Louis, Illinois was recorded in July 1954.

<text>Sangamon County is a county located near the center of the U.S. state of Illinois. According to the 2020 census, it had a population of 196,343. Its county seat and largest city is Springfield, the state capital.

Sangamon County is included in the Springfield, IL Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Sangamon County was formed in 1821 out of Madison and Bond counties. The county was named for the Sangamon River, which runs through it. The origin of the name of the river is unknown; among several explanations is the theory that it comes from the Pottawatomie word &quot;Sain-guee-mon&quot; (pronounced &quot;sang gä mun&quot;), meaning &quot;where there is plenty to eat.&quot; Published histories of neighboring Menard County (formed from Sangamon County) suggest that the name was first given to the river by the French explorers of the late 17th century as they passed through the region. The river was named to honor &quot;St. Gamo&quot;, or Saint Gamo, an 8th-century French Benedictine monk. The French pronunciation &quot;San-Gamo&quot; is the legacy.

Prior to being elected President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln represented Sangamon County in the Illinois Legislature. Lincoln, along with several other legislators, was instrumental in securing Springfield, the Sangamon County seat, as the state&#x27;s capital. Sangamon County was also within the congressional district represented by Lincoln when he served in the US House of Representatives. Another legislator who represented Sangamon County was Colonel Edmund Dick Taylor, also known as &quot;Father of the Greenback&quot;. The prominent financiers and industrialists Jacob Bunn and John Whitfield Bunn were based in Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois, as well as in Chicago, during the nineteenth century and the early twentieth century. The careers of these men and the people with whom they collaborated helped to shape much of the history and development of Sangamon County, Illinois.

==Politics==
Before 1932, Rock Island County was a Republican stronghold in presidential elections, backing the party&#x27;s candidate in every election from 1892 to 1928. From 1932 on, it has consistently backed Democratic Party presidential candidates, except for the national Republican landslides of 1952, 1956, 1972, and 1980. In 2016, Donald Trump managed to keep Hillary Clinton to a single-digit margin of victory, the first Republican to do so since Ronald Reagan in 1984; in 2020, Joe Biden increased the Democratic margin from 8.3% to 12.1%. Due to the dominance of the Democratic Party in county politics, Rock Island County remains one of the most Democratic counties outside of the Chicago area in Illinois. Since 2010 the Republican Party began making inroads in county politics, gaining a few seats on the Democratic-dominated county board; however, since 2018, the Republican Party influence on the board has begun to decrease as the county resumed heavy Democratic voting.

<doc id="96177" wikidata="Q486499" url="?curid=96177" title="Randolph County, Illinois">
<text>Randolph County is a county located in the U.S. state of Illinois. According to the 2020 census, it had a population of 30,163. Its county seat is Chester.

Owing to its role in the state&#x27;s history, the county motto is &quot;Where Illinois Began.&quot; It contains the historically important village of Kaskaskia, Illinois&#x27;s first capital.

The county is part of Southern Illinois in the southern portion of the state known locally as &quot;Little Egypt&quot;, and includes fertile river flats, part of the American Bottom; it is near the Greater St. Louis area.

==History==
Randolph County was organized in 1795 out of a part of St. Clair County. It was named in honor of Edmund Randolph, Governor of Virginia. George Rogers Clark of the army of Virginia captured the area from the British on July 4, 1778, near the end of the Revolutionary War. The area then became the seat, for several years, of Illinois County, Virginia, although the Congress of the Confederation legislated the existence of the Northwest Territory on July 13, 1787. Edmund Randolph was Governor of Virginia at the time Virginia ceded the Northwest Territory to the United States. In 1809, when Illinois became a separate territory, Territorial Secretary Nathaniel Pope, in his capacity as acting governor, issued a proclamation establishing Randolph as one of the Illinois&#x27; two original counties. The county&#x27;s boundaries were last changed in 1827, when land was taken to form Perry County.

The Mississippi River has played a prominent role in the county&#x27;s history, altering its boundaries in 1881 when it severed the isthmus that connected Kaskaskia to the Illinois mainland, destroying the original village of Kaskaskia and forcing its historic cemetery to be relocated across the river to Fort Kaskaskia. Crains Island, southeast of Chester, is another enclave of Illinois west of the Mississippi that was created by a change in the river&#x27;s course.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.6%) is water.

The Kaskaskia River flows into the Mississippi River in Randolph County. At this point the Mississippi, which usually defines the border between Illinois and Missouri, is entirely in Illinois. The Mississippi changed its course in the late-nineteenth century, leaving Kaskaskia, the former state capital, on the west side of the river. The boundary of the State, however, follows the old course of the river, leaving Illinois with an exclave on the western shore of the Mississippi River. A smaller enclave, Crains Island, is a few miles further down the river.

===Climate and weather===

In recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Chester have ranged from a low of in January to a high of in July, although a record low of was recorded in January 1985 and a record high of was recorded in July 2012. Average monthly precipitation ranged from in January to in May.

<text>The elepaio are three species of monarch flycatcher in the genus &quot;Chasiempis&quot;. They are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, and were formerly considered conspecific. They measure 14 cm long and weigh 12–18 g. One species inhabits the Big Island, another Oahu and the third Kauai. Being one of the most adaptable native birds of Hawaii, no subspecies have yet become extinct, though two have become quite rare.

The elepaio is the first native bird to sing in the morning and the last to stop singing at night; apart from whistled and chattering contact and alarm calls, it is probably best known for its song, from which derives the common name: a pleasant and rather loud warble which sounds like &quot;e-le-PAI-o&quot; or &quot;ele-PAI-o&quot;. It nests between January and June.

==Species==
The genus &quot;Chasiempis&quot; contains three species:
==Distribution==

Uniquely among Hawaiian passerines, the distribution of the elepaio is peculiarly discontinuous. According to fossil remains, the birds did not occur on Maui Nui or its successor islands. Their current distribution is absent from the Maui Nui island group. If this assumption is correct, the reasons are unknown at present. However, the strange &quot;flycatcher finches&quot;, extinct honeycreepers of the genus &quot;Vangulifer&quot;, are only known to have inhabited Maui and probably evolved on Maui Nui. There, they probably filled the same ecological niche as the elepaio did on the other islands. Competition from &quot;Vangulifer&quot; may thus have prevented a successful colonization of Maui Nui by &quot;Chasiempis&quot;.

==Cultural significance==
In Hawaiian tradition, the elepaio was among the most celebrated of the birds. It is associated with a number of significant roles in culture and mythology. Chiefly, it helped &quot;kālai waa&quot; (canoe-builders) to select the right &quot;koa&quot; tree to use for their &quot;waa&quot; (canoe). The elepaio is a bold and curious little bird, and thus it was attracted to humans whom it found working in its habitat, and it quickly learned to exploit feeding opportunities created by human activity, altering its behavior accordingly – which incidentally made it even more conspicuous.

For example, it followed canoe builders through dense vegetation, watching them as they searched for suitable trees. They considered it their guardian spirit, an incarnation of their patron goddess Lea, because if the bird pecked at a fallen tree, it was a sign that the tree was riddled with burrowing insects and thus not good anymore, but when the bird showed no interest in a tree, it indicated that the wood was suitable. This is the origin of the ancient Hawaiian proverb, &quot;Uā elepaio ia ka waa&quot; (&quot;The canoe is marked out by the elepaio&quot;). Due to its insectivorous habit, farmers believed the elepaio to be the incarnation of Lea&#x27;s sister goddess, Hina-puku-ai, who protected food plants and was a patron of agriculture.

==Status==
Although deforestation for agriculture destroyed large areas of habitat, the elepaio managed to adapt well to the initial settlement. Thus, its population was large enough to withstand the additional pressures that came about with Western colonization of the islands. However, the Oahu species has declined precipitously in recent years and is now endangered.

==Politics==
In its early days Pope County, being strongly Southern in its culture and opposed to Northern Illinois, was powerfully Democratic, giving a majority to that party in every pre-war Presidential election.
However, during the Civil War, under the influence of Congressman John A. Logan, this region of dubious initial loyalty was to provide a number of Union soldiers rivalled on a per capita basis only by a few fiercely Unionist counties in Appalachia.
Stephen A. Douglas in 1860 remains the last Democrat to win a majority of the county&#x27;s vote, although Bill Clinton won pluralities in both 1992 and 1996 due to Ross Perot siphoning votes from Republican opponents George Bush senior and Bob Dole. Hillary Clinton in 2016 fared extremely poorly, carrying fewer than eighteen percent of Pope County&#x27;s votes.

<text>Pike County is a county in the U.S. state of Illinois. It is located between the Mississippi River and the Illinois River in western Illinois. According to the 2020 United States census, it had a population of 14,739. Its county seat is Pittsfield.

==History==
Pike County was formed in January 1821 out of Edwards and Madison Counties. It was named in honor of Zebulon Pike, leader of the Pike Expedition in 1806 to map out the south and west portions of the Louisiana Purchase. Pike served at the Battle of Tippecanoe, and was killed in 1813 in the War of 1812.

Prior to the coming of the first European settler to the future Pike County, French traders, hunters, and travelers passed through the native forests and prairies. Originally Pike County began on the south junction of the Illinois and Mississippi rivers. The east boundary was the Illinois River north to the Kankakee River to the Indiana State line on north to Wisconsin territorial line and then west to the Mississippi River to the original point at the south end. The first county seat was Cole&#x27;s Grove, a post town, in what later became Calhoun County. &quot;The Gazetteer of Illinois and Missouri&quot;, published in 1822, mentioned Chicago as &quot;a village of Pike County&quot; containing 12 or 15 houses and about 60 or 70 inhabitants.

The New Philadelphia Town Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005, designated a National Historic Landmark in 2009, and established as a National Park in 2022. Founded by Frank McWorter, an early free black settler in Pike County, it was the first town founded by a black man in the United States. McWorter had invested in land there sight unseen after purchasing the first few members of his family out of slavery. In 1836 he founded the town of New Philadelphia, near Barry. He was elected mayor and lived there the rest of his life. With the sale of land, he made enough money to purchase the freedom of his children. After the railroad bypassed the town, its growth slowed and it was eventually abandoned in the 20th century. The town site is now an archaeological site.

In the early 21st century, Pike County acquired notability as a whitetail deer hunting center, especially for bowhunting.

==Geography==
According to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.1%) is water.

Pike County is located on the highlands between the Illinois River, which forms its eastern border, and the Mississippi River, which borders Missouri.

<text>The Last Stage (Polish: Ostatni etap) is a 1948 Polish historical drama film directed and co-written by Wanda Jakubowska, depicting her experiences in the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. The film was one of the early cinematic efforts to describe the Holocaust. Jakubowska’s film influenced subsequent directors that dealt with the subject, including Alain Resnais, Gillo Pontecorvo and Steven Spielberg. In film criticism, it is often referred to as &quot;the mother of all holocaust films&quot;.

It was Jakubowska&#x27;s first theatrically-released film and was both a commercial and critical success. It was seen by more than 7.8 million people in Poland and exported to dozens of countries. It also was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Film from Any Source in 1950. 

==Plot==
Marta Weiss (), a Polish Jew, arrives by cattle car to the Auschwitz concentration camp. While there, she catches the attention of the guards as she is multilingual and is put to work as a translator. When she inquires about the factory at the camp, a fellow inmate informs her that it is a crematorium and that the rest of her family likely has been murdered. The character Marta Weiss is based on the true life of Mala Zimetbaum.

In the barracks, many of the women are dying and ill. Eugenia, a prisoner and doctor, tries her best to minister to them but is unable to do much as supplies are limited. The women learn that an international commission is coming to the camp to observe the conditions of the prisoners. Eugenia learns a few key phrases in German and is able to tell the observers that everything they see is a lie and people are dying. Unfortunately the commanders tell the observers that Eugenia is mentally ill. Later they torture her to find out who taught her the German phrases but Eugenia refuses to tell them and is murdered.

Eugenia is replaced by Lalunia, a Polish woman who claims to have been rounded up by mistake and who says she is a doctor though she is actually only a pharmacist&#x27;s wife. However rather than administer medicine to the women of the camp she distributes them among the Kapos in exchange for luxuries like clothes and perfume. The nurses&#x27; aide searches her room and confiscates the remaining medicine. Lalunia later turns the aide in and has her killed after discovering messages she had written that the Russians were advancing.

Meanwhile, Marta is able to temporarily escape in order to smuggle information about the camps to a resistance broadcaster. When she is returned to the camp, she is tortured and then sentenced to death by hanging. A prisoner frees her wrists and hands her a knife before she is to die, and she tells the camp that the Russians are coming and slashes the face of the Nazi commander who tortured her. Before the guards can retaliate, planes are heard overhead, and Marta realizes that the Russians have come to liberate them.

==Production==

The film was written by Jakubowska and Gerda Schneider, also an Auschwitz survivor. Jakubowska initially thought about creating a film documenting her experience at Auschwitz while she was still an inmate at the camp: &quot;The decision to make a film about Auschwitz originated as soon as I crossed the camp&#x27;s gate.&quot; Upon her release from the camp she immediately began to work on a script and had completed a first draft by December 1945. As a survivor, she felt it was her duty and as a director to bear witness and register the magnitude of evil. In 1946 she travelled to Moscow with a filmic novella of the script translated into Russian and met with Mikhail Kalatozov, who was then responsible for Soviet cinema. Deeply moved, Kalatozov passed on the novella to Andrei Zhdanov. Zhadanov was deeply affected and sent the novella to Joseph Stalin. Stalin&#x27;s personal approval and the Soviet blessing made it possible for Jakubowska to make the film. Film Polski still required script revisions and sought input from writers, outsiders, political activists and former Auschwitz inmates.

The film is both set and filmed at Auschwitz and it was made with the participation of local inhabitants of Oświęcim, Red Army personnel and German prisoners of war as extras. Several of the actresses were former inmates of the camp themselves. Jerzy Kawalerowicz, an assistant director on the film said that these women &quot;were wiser than all assistant directors; they knew everything from experience. They saw it. Those former inmates were returning to their places.&quot; Czeslaw Piaskowski, the co-set designer, was also a concentration camp survivor. Jakubowska restored part of the camp for filming and the film crew stayed in the former SS quarters, with Jakubowska staying at the former home of Rudolf Höss.

==Reception==

The film won the Crystal Globe at Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 1948, and it was nominated for Grand International Award at Venice Film Festival in 1948 and for a BAFTA Award for Best Film from Any Source in 1950. It was reviewed by Bosley Crowther for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1949: &quot;...this latest import from Europe is a stark and uncompromising film... it carries a powerful comprehension of the shame and pathos of one of history&#x27;s darkest hours.&quot; In 1996, Stephen Holden also wrote about the film in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Bleaker and more terrifying than &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List,&quot; this inky, nightmarish film has the atmosphere of a horror movie up until its sentimental ending.&quot; In the introduction to Jakubowska&#x27;s published script, Jerzy Toeplitz wrote: &quot;The value of the film lies in the ideological stand of its maker, who put her great talent and all her strength into the effort to fight fascism, to unmask its genocidal method.&quot;

Film critic Peter Bradshaw gave the film a five star review in 2023 in &quot;The Guardian&quot; upon its release on streaming platform, Mubi. Bradshaw wrote: &quot;The Last Stage is a forthright, vehement film with a confident and almost Hollywoodised way of portraying the nightmare, but with a distinctive emphasis on the leftist Polish patriots and their defiant plan to resist. The existence of the gas chambers themselves is casually, in fact bloodfreezingly, invoked, though they are not in direct sight...The Last Stage is essential both as a film and historical document.&quot; In the same year it was described as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; by &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; magazine: &quot;The Last Stage accords respect and dignity to the prisoners, shows them as complex human beings, puts them at the centre of the narrative.&quot;

<text>Perry County is a county in Illinois. According to the 2020 census, it had a population of 20,945. Its county seat is Pinckneyville. It is located in the southern portion of Illinois known as &quot;Little Egypt&quot;.

==History==
Perry County was formed in 1827 out of Jackson and Randolph counties. It was named in honor of Oliver Hazard Perry who defeated the British fleet at the decisive Battle of Lake Erie in the War of 1812.

In its early history, Perry County was mainly an inland pioneer outpost. Early settlers, including some Revolutionary War veterans bearing land grants, moved here from the Eastern United States. These were primarily Protestant settlers. Growth boomed in the 1850s for two reasons: construction of the Illinois Central Railroad through the eastern portion of the county, and the discovery of large coal reserves. Immigrants from Ireland, Poland, Germany, Italy and elsewhere steadily increased the county&#x27;s population from 1850 through the 1920s. African Americans also were established in the county during northward migration following the Civil War.

Mining continued to be the dominant employment sector through the 1990s.

==Geography==

The county&#x27;s topography also features many &quot;strip cut&quot; lakes, lakes left behind following above-ground coal mining. Lakes at two of the county&#x27;s chief recreation areas, the Du Quoin State Fairgrounds and Pyramid State Recreation Area, were formed this way.

== Government ==
Peoria County is governed by an 18-member County Board which meets on the second Thursday of each month. Each member represents a district with roughly 10,000 residents.

The County also elects an Auditor, Circuit Clerk, Coroner, County Clerk, Sheriff, State&#x27;s Attorney, Regional Superintendent (Education), and Treasurer to four-year terms.

==Politics==













Prior to 1992, Peoria County, like most of central Illinois, was powerfully Republican. Usually, it only voted for Democratic Party presidential candidates when they won nationally by a landslide. It began trending away from the GOP in the mid-1980s, as evidenced when Ronald Reagan only carried it with 55 percent of the vote in 1984 even as he was winning reelection in a landslide nationally.

From 1992 onward, the county has backed the Democratic candidate in every presidential election, though never by a margin greater than 10 percent aside from 2008 when Illinoisan Barack Obama won it by nearly 14 points. This relative closeness in results was most evident in 2004 when the county backed John Kerry over George W. Bush by only 70 votes.

In Congress, Peoria County is represented by Democrat Eric Sorensen of Illinois&#x27;s 17th congressional district and Republican Darin LaHood of the Illinois&#x27;s 18th congressional district.

In the Illinois Senate, Peoria County is represented by Republican Win Stoller of the 37th Legislative District and Democrat Dave Koehler of the 46th Legislative District. In the Illinois House of Representatives, Peoria County is represented by Republican Ryan Spain of the 73rd Representative District, Republican Travis Weaver of the 91st Representative District and Democrat Jehan Gordon-Booth of the 92nd Representative District.

<text>Fisaga in Samoan mythology is a light and the gentle breeze. In one Samoan legend, Tiʻitiʻi imprisons the winds one by one in his canoe or calabash, leaving only Fisaga free. Other versions of the story attribute this to Maui.

In the Samoan language, fisaga refers to a “gentle, pleasant wind associated with good weather.”

Its county seat is Oregon, and its largest city is Rochelle.

==History==
Ogle County was formed in 1836 out of Jo Daviess and LaSalle counties, and named in honor of Captain Joseph Ogle, a veteran of the Revolutionary War who settled in Illinois in 1785. Ogle County government was organized in 1837; before that time it remained assigned to Jo Daviess County for legislative, taxation, and judicial matters. In 1839, part of Ogle County was partitioned off to form Lee County.

Ogle County was a New England settlement. The founders of Oregon and Rochelle arrived from New England; they were &quot;Yankees&quot;, descendants of English Puritans who had settled New England in the 1600s. They were part of a wave of farmers who migrated into the Northwest Territory in the early 1800s, their trek eased by completion of the Erie Canal in 1825. They found virgin forest and wild prairie, and quickly laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes. They brought a passion for education and strong abolitionism. They were members of the Congregationalist or Episcopalian Church. Culturally Ogle County, like much of northern Illinois would maintain values similar to those of New England.

<text>Moultrie County is a county in the U.S. state of Illinois. According to the 2020 United States census, its population was 14,526. Its county seat is Sullivan. The name is pronounced as in &quot;mole tree&quot;, unlike the pronunciation of its namesake, the South Carolinian Revolutionary War hero William Moultrie.

==History==
Moultrie County was formed in 1843 with areas taken from Shelby and Macon counties. It is named for South Carolina General, and later Governor, William Moultrie. General Moultrie defended Sullivan&#x27;s Island, South Carolina from British attack in 1776. The site was later renamed Fort Moultrie. Nearby Jasper County was named for Sgt. William Jasper, another hero of the defense of Sullivan&#x27;s Island.

The official flag of the county is the Moultrie Flag, which was flown over the new fortress on Sullivan&#x27;s Island, when Moultrie defended it, and was designed by Moultrie. It went on to become iconic of liberty in the South.

When Abraham Kellar of Lovington, John Cook of Marrowbone, and John Fleming of Nelson proposed the formation of a new county from Macon, Shelby, and Coles counties, Macon gave up a strip of “worthless swamp” that is now among the most fertile land in the world, but Shelby and Coles voters refused to give up any land. Finally, Shelby County gave up some of its land to make a zig-zag border with Moultrie County.
