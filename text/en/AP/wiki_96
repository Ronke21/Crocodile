<text>Daniel Francis Boyle (born 20 October 1956) is an English director and producer. He is known for his work on the films &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; (1994), &quot;Trainspotting&quot; (1996) and its sequel &quot;T2 Trainspotting&quot; (2017), &quot;The Beach&quot; (2000), &quot;28 Days Later&quot; (2002), &quot;Sunshine&quot; (2007), &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; (2008), &quot;127 Hours&quot; (2010), &quot;Steve Jobs&quot; (2015), and &quot;Yesterday&quot; (2019).

Boyle&#x27;s debut film &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; won the BAFTA Award for Best British Film. The British Film Institute ranked &quot;Trainspotting&quot; the 10th greatest British film of the 20th century. Boyle&#x27;s 2008 crime drama film &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;, the most successful British film of the decade, was nominated for ten Academy Awards and won eight, including the Academy Award for Best Director. He also won the Golden Globe and BAFTA Award for Best Director. Boyle received two more Academy Award nominations for writing and producing the survival drama &quot;127 Hours&quot;.

In 2012, Boyle was the artistic director for the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. He was subsequently offered a knighthood as part of the New Year Honours but declined due to his republican beliefs.

==Early life and education==
Danny Francis Boyle was born on 20 October 1956, in Radcliffe, Lancashire, England, about north of Manchester&#x27;s city centre, to Irish parents Frank and Annie Boyle, both from County Galway. He has a twin sister, Marie, and a younger sister, Bernadette, both of whom are teachers.

Although he now describes himself as a &quot;spiritual atheist&quot;, he was brought up in a working-class Catholic family. Boyle was an altar boy for eight years and his mother had the priesthood in mind for him, but at the age of 14 he was persuaded by a priest not to transfer to a seminary.

Boyle attended Thornleigh Salesian College, a Catholic boys&#x27; direct grant grammar school in Bolton, and studied English and drama at the University College of North Wales (now Bangor University), where he directed several productions for the student drama society.

==Career==
===Theatre and television===

Upon graduating from university he began his career at the Joint Stock Theatre Company before moving on to the Royal Court Theatre in 1982 where he directed &quot;The Genius&quot; by Howard Brenton and &quot;Saved&quot; by Edward Bond. He also directed five productions for the Royal Shakespeare Company.

In 1987 Boyle started working in television as a producer for BBC Northern Ireland where he produced, amongst other TV films, Alan Clarke&#x27;s controversial &quot;Elephant&quot; before becoming a director on shows such as &quot;Arise And Go Now&quot;, &quot;Not Even God Is Wise Enough&quot;, &quot;For The Greater Good&quot;, &quot;Scout,&quot; and two episodes of &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;.

Boyle was responsible for the BBC Two series &quot;Mr. Wroe&#x27;s Virgins&quot; in 1993. In between &quot;The Beach&quot; and &quot;28 Days Later&quot; Boyle directed two TV films for the BBC in 2001–&quot;Vacuuming Completely Nude in Paradise&quot; and &quot;Strumpet&quot;.

In 2011, he directed &quot;Frankenstein&quot; for the National Theatre. This production was broadcast to cinemas as a part of National Theatre Live on 17 March 2011. He has also appeared on &quot;Top Gear&quot; and set the fastest wet lap at that time. In 2014 both Boyle and Christian Colson signed to a first look deal with FX Productions.

In September 2022, it was announced that Boyle would direct a dance adaptation of &quot;The Matrix&quot;, titled &quot;Free Your Mind&quot;, which debuted in October 2023 in Manchester.

====&quot;The Children&#x27;s Monologues&quot;====

On 14 November 2010, he directed a one-night play at the Old Vic Theatre in London titled &quot;The Children&#x27;s Monologues&quot; starring Sir Ben Kingsley, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hiddleston, Gemma Arterton, and Eddie Redmayne, in aid of his charity Dramatic Need, which operates in Rwanda and South Africa, helping young people to come to terms with trauma and conflict. He co-directed another performance of the play in 2015 at the Royal Court Theatre, and again in 2017 at Carnegie Hall in New York City.

==== &quot;Isles of Wonder&quot; ====

Boyle was artistic director for the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in London. Entitled &quot;Isles of Wonder&quot;, it charted aspects of British culture including the Industrial Revolution and contributions to literature, music, film, and technology.

Reception to the ceremony was generally positive both nationally in the United Kingdom and internationally.

==== &quot;Pistol&quot; ====
On 11 January 2021, it was announced that Boyle would be adapting the Steve Jones&#x27; autobiography &quot;Lonely Boy&quot; into a six-part TV series entitled &quot;Pistol&quot; that charts the rise and fall of the Sex Pistols. The series aired on FX and Disney+ on 30 May 2022, and stars Emma Appleton, Louis Partridge and Maisie Williams, amongst others. The show was filmed in London.

===Film===
Boyle&#x27;s love for film began with his first viewing of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;:
It had eviscerated my brain, completely. I was an impressionable twenty-one-year-old guy from the sticks. My brain had not been fed and watered with great culture, you know, as art is meant to do. It had been sandblasted by the power of cinema. And that&#x27;s why cinema, despite everything we try to do, it remains a young man&#x27;s medium, really, in terms of audience.

==== 1990s: &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; and &quot;Trainspotting&quot; ====
The first film Boyle directed was &quot;Shallow Grave&quot;. The film was the most commercially successful British film of 1995, won the BAFTA Award for Best British Film, and led to the production of &quot;Trainspotting.&quot; Working with writer John Hodge and producer Andrew Macdonald, &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; earned Boyle the Best Newcomer Award from the 1996 London Film Critics Circle. Critics credited these films with revitalising British cinema in the early &#x27;90s. The BFI ranked &quot;Trainspotting&quot; the 10th greatest British film of the 20th century.

Boyle declined an offer to direct the fourth film of the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise to make &quot;A Life Less Ordinary.&quot;

==== 2000s: &quot;The Beach&quot;, &quot;28 Days Later&quot; and &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; ====
Boyle&#x27;s next project was a film adaptation of the cult novel &quot;The Beach&quot; by Alex Garland. Filmed in Thailand with Leonardo DiCaprio, casting of the film led to a feud with Ewan McGregor. He then collaborated with Garland on the post-apocalyptic horror film &quot;28 Days Later&quot;.
He also directed a short film &quot;Alien Love Triangle&quot; (starring Kenneth Branagh), which was intended to be one of three shorts within a feature film. However the project was cancelled after the two other shorts were made into feature films: &quot;Mimic&quot; starring Mira Sorvino and &quot;Impostor&quot; starring Gary Sinise. In 2004 Boyle directed &quot;Millions&quot;, scripted by Frank Cottrell Boyce. His next collaboration with Alex Garland was the 2007 science-fiction film &quot;Sunshine&quot;, featuring &quot;28 Days Later&quot; star Cillian Murphy.

In 2008 he directed &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;, the story of an impoverished child (Dev Patel) on the streets of Mumbai, India, who competes on the local version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, for which Boyle won Academy and BAFTA Awards for Best Director. The most successful British film of the decade, the film won eight Academy Awards and seven BAFTA Awards. Boyle commented, &quot;To be a film-maker...you have to lead. You have to be psychotic in your desire to do something. People always like the easy route. You have to push very hard to get something unusual, something different.&quot; Andrew Macdonald, producer of &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, said &quot;Boyle takes a subject that you&#x27;ve often seen portrayed realistically, in a politically correct way, whether it&#x27;s junkies or slum orphans, and he has managed to make it realistic but also incredibly uplifting and joyful.&quot; The success led a deal with Fox Searchlight.

Despite the commercial success of &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;, Boyle also faced great criticism for his portrayal of India through a Western, idealized lens. Some critics saw the film as &quot;poverty porn,&quot; though Boyle argued he showed India&#x27;s &quot;lust for life&quot; and &quot;resilience.&quot;

==== 2010s: &quot;127 Hours&quot;, &quot;Steve Jobs&quot; and &quot;T2 Trainspotting&quot; ====
In 2010, Boyle directed the film &quot;127 Hours&quot;, starring James Franco and featuring Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara. It was based on Aron Ralston&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Between a Rock and a Hard Place&quot;, which detailed his struggle of being trapped under a boulder while canyoneering alone in Bluejohn Canyon, southeastern Utah. The film was released on 5 November 2010 to critical acclaim and got six nominations at the 83rd Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay for Boyle and Best Actor for Franco.
Boyle&#x27;s next film was &quot;Trance&quot;, starring James McAvoy and Rosario Dawson. It has been reported another instalment of the &quot;28 Days Later&quot; franchise is in the development stages. Boyle has stated previously that in theory the third instalment of the series would be titled &quot;28 Months Later&quot;, but alluded to a film taking place somewhere else in the world he created in &quot;28 Days Later&quot; and &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot;. He was also stated to be producing the upcoming film &quot;Paani&quot;.

Boyle told an interviewer about the eclectic range of his films, &quot;There&#x27;s a theme running through all of them—and I just realised this. They&#x27;re all about someone facing impossible odds and overcoming them.&quot; With a strong interest in music, Boyle has mentioned in interviews that he has considered a musical film with original compositions. Boyle has also expressed interest in an animated film.

Boyle&#x27;s eponymous biopic of Apple Inc. founder Steve Jobs closed the 59th BFI London Film Festival. It was the third time Boyle has had that honour, after &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; in 2008 and &quot;127 Hours&quot; two years later. The BFI&#x27;s London Film Festival Director, Clare Stewart, said Boyle had created an exhilarating and audacious film about a complex, charismatic pioneer. He then directed the sequel to &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, &quot;T2 Trainspotting&quot;.

In a BBC interview, Boyle stated that he didn&#x27;t write his own films but they did reflect his personality. &quot;I am not a big auteur fan and like to work with writers, but ultimately a film is a director&#x27;s vision, because he gets all its elements together towards that vision.&quot;

In March 2018, Boyle confirmed he would be directing the then-untitled twenty-fifth James Bond film (later known as &quot;No Time to Die&quot;) but dropped out that August due to a dispute over the film&#x27;s script.

He and writer Richard Curtis collaborated on &quot;Yesterday&quot;, starring Himesh Patel, Kate McKinnon, Lily James, and Ed Sheeran, released on 28 June 2019.

In 2024, it was confirmed that Boyle will make &quot;28 Years Later&quot;, which is set in a post-apocalyptic Britain 28 years after the first film in the &quot;28 Days Later&quot; series, and will star Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes.

==Personal life==
While at university, Boyle dated actress Frances Barber.

Boyle is a constitutional republican. He lives in Mile End, London.

==Other activities==
Boyle was a founding trustee in 2007, of Dramatic Need, a charity which operated in Rwanda and South Africa, helping young people to come to terms with trauma and conflict. The charity was wound up in November 2021.

, Boyle was the patron of North West England-based young people&#x27;s substance misuse charity, Early Break, which was founded and based in his home town of Radcliffe.

In 2014, it was announced that Boyle would become a patron of HOME in Manchester.

In February 2017, Boyle announced a bid to launch a £30 million film and media school in Manchester. Manchester School of Digital Arts was subsequently launched in June 2022 as part of Manchester Metropolitan University.

==Recognition==
In 2010, &quot;The Tablet&quot; named Boyle one of Britain&#x27;s most influential Roman Catholics.

The BBC referred to Boyle as a &quot;titan of the British film industry – renowned for his spunky grit – typified by his 1996 film &quot;Trainspotting&quot;.&quot;

In 2012, Boyle was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover, to celebrate the British cultural figures of his lifetime.

In December 2012, it was widely reported that Boyle turned down a knighthood in the New Year Honours list. He told BBC Radio 4 &quot;I&#x27;m very proud to be an equal citizen and I think that&#x27;s what the opening ceremony was actually about.&quot;

The Fairbanks North Star Borough School District operates the public K-12 schools that serve the CDP, along with the remainder of the borough. The oldest of these is University Park Elementary (&quot;U-Park&quot;), which opened in 1958 along University Avenue. A new school building for U-Park was constructed on Loftus Road during the 1990s; the original school is now used for classrooms by the UAF Community and Technical College. The district operates several other schools within CDP boundaries: along with U-Park, Pearl Creek Elementary, Woodriver Elementary and West Valley High serve attendance areas which include the CDP (middle school students attend Randy Smith Middle and Ryan Middle, located in Fairbanks city limits). Effie Kokrine Charter, Watershed Charter and Hutchison High are also located in the CDP. These schools have open enrollment and are not governed by attendance area boundaries.

The Yukon–Koyukuk School District, which operates public schools in a widely scattered swath of rural Interior Alaska covering much of the nearby Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, has its headquarters within the CDP boundaries.

The CDP includes the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

<text>Eielson Air Force Base is a United States Air Force (USAF) base located approximately southeast of Fairbanks, Alaska, and just southeast of Moose Creek, Alaska. It was established in 1943 as Mile 26 Satellite Field and redesignated Eielson Air Force Base on 13 January 1948. It has been a Superfund site since 1989. Eielson AFB was named in honor of polar pilot Carl Ben Eielson.

Its host unit is the 354th Fighter Wing (354 FW) assigned to the Eleventh Air Force of the Pacific Air Forces. The 354 FW&#x27;s primary mission is to support RED FLAG-Alaska, a series of Pacific Air Forces commander–directed field training exercises for U.S. Forces, joint offensive counter-air, interdiction, close-air support, and large force employment training in a simulated combat environment. These exercises are conducted on the Joint Pacific Alaskan Range Complex (JPARC) with air operations flown out of Eielson and its sister installation, Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson (the former Elmendorf Air Force Base).

Eielson projects to have 54 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II combat aircraft assigned to the installation, of which the first two aircraft arrived on 21 April 2020. The last of the aircraft arrived in April 2022. The planes come with an estimated 3,500 personnel, to include airmen and their families as well as civilian personnel. The F-35 program increases the number of military personnel at Eielson by approximately 50%, which is a significant change for a base once on the brink of closure.

==History==

===World War II===
On 7 June 1943, the Western Defense Command ordered construction of a new airfield near present-day Fort Wainwright, then a United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) airfield named after Major Arthur K. Ladd. Because of its hazard-free approaches and relatively flat terrain, surveyor reports indicated a site a little more than 25 miles southeast of Ladd Army Airfield to be the best in the vicinity for military aviation. The field became known as &quot;Mile 26&quot; because of its proximity to a United States Army Signal Corps telegraph station and a Richardson Highway milepost marker using the same designation.

A month later, contractors and civilian crews from Ladd Field started laying out the new airfield. Actual construction began on 25 August 1943. Crews built two parallel runways, across and long. Other facilities included an operations building, housing for 108 officer and 330 enlisted personnel, and a ten-bed dispensary. The garrison and airfield totaled about . Completed on 17 October 1944, the 14-month project cost about eight-million dollars.

Operational uses of Mile 26 were few. Ladd Field served as the debarkation point for the Alaska-Siberia Ferry Route of the Lend-Lease program and was the hub of activity. Lend-lease aircraft would occasionally land at Mile 26, but there are no records indicating any lend-lease aircraft used the airfield to depart for the Soviet Union. Mile 26 closed when the war ended.

===Cold War===
The base reopened in September 1946, once again as a satellite of Ladd Field. The first USAAF operational unit assigned to Eielson was the 57th Fighter Group, equipped successively with P-38 Lightnings, P/F-51 Mustangs, F-80 Shooting Stars, and F-94 Starfire aircraft. The 57th FG was inactivated on 13 April 1953. On 1 December 1947 Strategic Air Command B-29 Superfortress bombers arrived at Mile 26 Field with the deployment of the 97th Bombardment Wing, Very Heavy, from Smoky Hill Air Force Base, Kansas. The wing reported to Fifteenth Air Force, Strategic Air Command (SAC), although the Yukon Sector of the Alaskan Air Command controlled its operations. At the end of the Alaskan deployment the wing returned to Kansas on 12 March 1948.

A year later Eielson moved from under the shadow of Ladd Field when the Alaskan Air Command assumed organizational control. Also in the fall of 1947, Colonel Jerome B. McCauley assumed duties as commander. The primary missions of Mile 26 were to support Arctic training for USAF tactical and strategic units, as well as defend the base itself.

Headquarters USAF General Order 2, dated 13 January 1948, redesignated Mile 26 as Eielson Air Force Base. It was named for Carl Ben Eielson, an Alaska aviation pioneer who was killed, along with his mechanic Earl Borland, in the crash of their Hamilton H-45 aircraft in 1929. Eielson and Borland were attempting a rescue flight to an icebound ship in the Bering Sea when they were killed. On 1 April 1948, the Eielson Air Force Base Wing (Base Complement) was formed. The host-unit subsequently would be dubbed the Eielson Air force Base Bomb Wing, and finally, in January 1949, the 5010th Wing. Colonel John L. Nedwed, the third commander of the base since it fell under Alaskan Air Command fifteen months before, became the first to head the 5010th.

For the next 34 years, the 5010th (alternately known as the Wing, Composite Wing, Air Base Wing, and lastly, Combat Support Group) served as host-unit at Eielson. Construction boomed at Eielson during the 1950s. Many of the facilities used today were built at that time, including Amber Hall, the Thunderdome, Base Exchange, Gymnasium, Theater, some of the schools, and many of the dormitories.

The 720th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, equipped with F-86 Sabres, was deployed to Eielson during 1954–55. The 720th was a part of the 450th Fighter-Bomber Wing stationed at Foster Air Force Base, Texas. The 720th was replaced by the 455th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (323d FBW), stationed at Bunker Hill Air Force Base, Indiana.

The Air Defense Command deployed interceptors to Eielson during the 1960s. Det. 3, 317th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron from Elmendorf Air Force Base deployed F-102 Delta Daggers and F-106 Delta Darts to the base between 1960 and 1969.

During the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962, Eielson-based Lockheed U-2 pilot Charles Maultsby was allegedly blinded by the aurora borealis while collecting radiation from Soviet nuclear weapons tests over the North Pole and accidentally strayed into Soviet airspace, into Chukotka. Soviet MiG interceptors were sent to intercept the plane before he was escorted back to U.S. territory by nuclear-armed F-102 interceptors.
The Cold War saw the use of Eielson&#x27;s expansive reservation as a maneuver area for the U.S. Army. The 1960s 171st Infantry Brigade (Separate) and 172nd Infantry Brigade (Separate) both trained here, both on a regular and extensive basis, not to mention units of the Alaska National Guard. Later in the 70s mid 80s the 172nd Infantry Brigade (the 171st Infantry Brigade was inactivated on 13 November 1972), followed by the 6th Infantry Division when the 172nd Infantry Brigade itself was deactivated on 15 April 1986 (it was reactivated in Alaska on 17 April 1998, and inactivated in Iraq on 14 December 2006)

Today the 1st Brigade 25th Infantry Division and the 4th Brigade 25th Infantry Division can be found training there. Several important large scale winter field problems have been conducted here over the years as well, seeing large numbers of U.S. Army ground combat units from the Contiguous United States lower 48 states, U.S. Marine Corps units, and Canadian Armed Forces troops.

375th/58th Strategic Weather Squadron

The 375th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, from the 308th Bombardment Group at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, arrived at Eielson on 5 March 1949. The 308th flew WB-29 Superfortresses. The unit was redesignated the 58th Strategic Weather Squadron on 21 February 1951 as part of the 303d Bombardment Wing at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona.

The 58th Weather Squadron remained at Eielson until 8 August 1958.

6th Strategic Wing

In July 1960, the Strategic Air Command (SAC) stationed the 4157th Combat Support Group (later Strategic Wing) at Eielson. The 6th Strategic Wing (6 SW) replaced the 4157 SW on 25 March 1967, relocating from Walker Air Force Base, New Mexico after its closure.

The 6th SW flew RC–135 strategic reconnaissance missions with an assigned squadron, and, with KC–135 Stratotankers deployed to Eielson from SAC, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and the Air National Guard (ANG), conducted Alaska Tanker Task Force (ATTF) missions to support reconnaissance and numerous exercises for the USAF and U.S. Navy.

The 6th SW remained at Eielson AFB until 1992.

343d Composite Wing

A new chapter for the base began 1 October 1981 when the 343d Composite Wing replaced the 5010th as Eielson&#x27;s host unit. Flying squadrons assigned to the new wing included the 25th Tactical Air Support Squadron (TASS) and the 18th Fighter Squadron (18 FS). The 25 TASS, at Eielson since 1971, flew O-2 Skymaster and OV-10 Bronco aircraft until its inactivation in 1989; the newly assigned 18 FS operated A-10 Thunderbolt IIs until it converted to F-16 Fighting Falcons in 1991.

In 1984, the 343d Composite Wing was redesignated a Tactical Fighter Wing. Seven years later, in 1991, it was redesignated as the 343d Wing. Also that year, the 343d gained a second flying unit, the 11th Tactical Air Support Squadron (11 TASS), which flew OA-10 aircraft.

===354th Fighter Wing===


On 20 August 1993, the 354 FW replaced the 343d Wing. No personnel or equipment were affected by the change. Prior to its shutdown, the 343d was the oldest surviving air combat unit in Alaska with a lineage dating back to the Aleutian Campaign. The 18 FS, whose history also dated back to World War II, remained active, but the 355 FS replaced the 11th TASS.

Another change involved the 3rd Fighter Training Squadron, which was replaced by the 353rd Fighter Squadron (later redesignated as a Combat Training Squadron).

Within the first year of its arrival the 354 FW hosted an Arctic combat search and rescue exercise between the United States, Canada, and Russia. Ironically, these were the same countries that took part in the search and recovery efforts that followed the fatal crash of Carl Ben Eielson and his mechanic, Earl Borland, in 1930 as they were attempting to fly relief supplies to the &quot;Nanuk&quot;.

The 343d FW 3d Fighter Training Squadron was replaced by the 353d Fighter Training Squadron from the 354th FW. The 3d Fighter Training Squadron had its origins with the 3d Tactical Fighter Squadron at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, being formed in March 1973. The 3d TFS received its A-7D Corsair II aircraft from the then deployed 353d Tactical Fighter Squadron of the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing, deployed to Korat from Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina.

== Role and operations ==
Eielson is home to the 354th Fighter Wing which is part of the Eleventh Air Force (11 AF) of the Pacific Air Forces. The 354th Fighter Wing mission is to &quot;Prepare U.S. and partner forces for 21st century combat and to project and integrate Airpower in support of worldwide operations.&quot; The wing vision is &quot;An elite team of pioneering Airmen forging Airpower&#x27;s frontier through world-class training, engagement, and readiness for 21st century combat.&quot; The wing has six priorities, which are: &quot;Strong Airmen and Families, Resilient Airfield and Infrastructure, Preparation for 2 x F-35 Combat Squadrons, Premier Joint/Air Exercises and Adversary Support, Synchronized Airpower into Army I Corps Ops, and OPLAN-Focused Readiness.&quot;

Airmen who are stationed on Eielson commonly refer to themselves as &quot;Icemen&quot; due to the frigid Alaskan weather. Their wing motto is: &quot;Ready to go at fifty below!&quot;

The 356th Fighter Squadron was reactivated on 10 October 2019 at Eielson Air Force Base, assigned to the 354th Operations Group. It is to be equipped with the F-35A Lightning II.

== Eielson&#x27;s locomotives ==

Eielson Air Force Base has several locomotives to transport coal in winter to the base&#x27;s power station.

==Microreactor==
The Department of the Air Force has selected Eielson Air Force Base for its first nuclear microreactor. A National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) assessment will begin by 2024. Microreactor testing and demonstration of power and steam is expected by year-end 2027.

==Environmental problems==
Eielson Air Force Base was proposed to be a Superfund site on 14 July 1989, and was officially designated as such on 21 November 1989.

The groundwater contains lead and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like benzene, xylene, and toluene. Several areas of underground petroleum-contaminated soil and floating petroleum product are the sources of continuing groundwater contamination. Ingesting or coming into direct contact with contaminated groundwater or soil can pose a potential health threat. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated fish were also found in the area. Construction of the superfund site was complete in 1998.

In 2014, Eielson tested waters and soils for perfluorinated compounds around areas where aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) had been used for firefighting and training. In March 2015, the base changed its source of drinking water, because contamination had been found. In April 2015, wells near Moose Creek, Alaska, the community to the north, were tested and found contaminated. In July 2015, water from 132 Moose Creek wells, which serve more than 200 residences, was found to contain perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) above the health advisory level of 0.2 micrograms per liter by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The highest reading in Moose Creek was 2.09 micrograms per liter, and the highest level on Eielson reached 2,000 micrograms per liter at the site of a KC-135 aircraft fire in 1989. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation said &quot;contamination stretches 6.5 miles from the south of Eielson&#x27;s runway to the north of Moose Creek and is found up to 100 feet deep&quot;. the extent of contamination was unknown and if there was one large plume or multiple small ones. The USAF has held meetings to discuss different solutions for providing affected homes with water. , between 145 and 150 homes had well water with PFOS above the EPA health advisory concentrations. With EPA&#x27;s national water quality standard announced in May 2016, 15 more homes in the Moose Creek community were added. Work is now being done to connect the affected homes to water from the City of North Pole&#x27;s public utilities.

==Demographics==


Eielson Air Force Base first appeared on the 1970 United States census as an unincorporated area. In 1980, it was made a census-designated place (CDP). It is located within Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska.

As of the census of 2000, there were 5,400 people, 1,448 households, and 1,414 families residing on the base. The population density was . There were 1,531 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the base was 81.7% White, 9.4% Black or African American, 0.6% Native American, 2.1% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 2.2% from other races, and 3.9% from two or more races, and 5.8% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 1,448 households, out of which 77.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 92.4% were married couples living together, 2.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 2.3% were non-families. 2.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 0.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.52 and the average family size was 3.55.

The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females there were 110.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 114.7 males.

The median income for a household in the base was $35,938, and the median income for a family was $35,688. Males had a median income of $24,961 versus $21,432 for females. The per capita income for the base was $11,512. 6.0% of the population and 5.1% of families were below the poverty line. Of the total population, 7.5% under the age of 18 years and 0.0% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.

==2005 BRAC proceedings==

On 13 May 2005, The United States Department of Defense proposed a major realignment of the base as part of the Base Realignment and Closure program.
* It was decided that Eielson Air Force Base was to remain open.
* That the 354th Wing&#x27;s A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft were to be redistributed to the Air Force Reserve Command&#x27;s 917th Wing (now the 917th Fighter Group of the 442d Fighter Wing) at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana (three aircraft); to the Air Combat Command&#x27;s 23d Wing at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia (12 aircraft); and to backup inventory at AMARC at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona (three aircraft). This action was part of a larger effort to consolidate the A-10 fleet. The 355th Fighter Squadron (355 FS) was inactivated on 15 August 2007 when the last A-10 departed Eielson.
* The 18th Fighter Squadron (18 FS) converted to the 18th Aggressor Squadron. This squadron trains in the same manner as the aggressors at Nellis Air Force Base, learning the flying styles and abilities of foreign air forces to train USAF pilots. Aircraft changes entail sending all 18 of its Block 40 F-16 Fighting Falcons to Kunsan Air Base, Korea, and receiving 18 Block 30 F-16Cs from Kunsan. The 18th Aggressor Squadron was officially established on 24 August 2007.
* The Alaska Air National Guard&#x27;s 168th Air Refueling Wing and its KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft will remain at Eielson.

==Education==
The school district for dependents living on-post is the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District (FNSBSD). The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) does not operate any schools for this facility. Residents on-post are zoned to Anderson-Crawford Elementary School, North Pole Middle School, and North Pole High School.

The base formerly housed two separate elementary schools, Anderson and Crawford (grades K-2 and 3-6, respectively), along with Ben Eielson Junior/Senior High School. In 2022 Anderson closed. The junior-senior high school closed 2024, due to a loss in funds.

<text>Ester is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, United States. It is part of the Fairbanks, Alaska Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population in the CDP was 2,422 at the 2010 census, although there are only around 12 houses located inside of the village, the rest are in the surrounding area. The Ester Camp Historic District is a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Ester was founded as a gold mining camp in the early 1900s, and the economy has focused on mining and services for miners. The Ester Volunteer Fire Department, John Trigg Ester Library, Ester Historic Society and Ester Post Office serve residents in Ester and surrounding areas. There is also a convenience store and secular chapel on the outskirts of the village. Many artists, writers, and musicians reside in Ester.

== Ester in geological and prehistoric time ==
The hydraulic mining technique of directing high pressurized streams of water onto the land to uncover gold revealed that Ester had rich deposits of fossils and bones of prehistoric animals. In the 1950s, Walter Wigger, who owned the Ester Creek Gold Mine, discovered a 198-pound mammoth tusk along Ester Creek. Images taken by tourists during the 1940s provide visual evidence of prehistoric animal remains, such as tusks, skulls, and large leg bones that were washed out by the process of stripping.

==History==
===Early history and founding===
Ester was originally a gold mining camp on Ester Creek, with the first claim staked in February 1903 by Latham A. Jones. Jones worked with the Eagle Mining Company, the biggest claimholder on Glen Gulch in the Rampart mining district, but it was an independent miner, John &quot;Jack&quot; Mihalcik, a Czechoslovakian immigrant born in 1866, who was the first person to actually discover gold in Ester Creek. Mihalcik staked his claim in November 1903 but the news of the discovery of gold did not become public until the following February. By 1907, Ester City had a population of around 200 people, with a thriving mining industry. A social hall was completed in 1907 and was well-known throughout the mining district for its dance floor. The hall was used for religious services as well as dances, movies, card games, parties, and other entertainment purposes. The town had five saloons and two hotels. In 1908 and 1910, the hall was the site of campaign speeches by candidates for the seat of Territorial Delegate. (Labor won in 1908, but Judge James Wickersham won the Ester precinct in 1910.) By 1909, Ester City had a baseball field, a doctor, a mine workers&#x27; union local, and a teacher, but gold production was beginning to decline.

The Berry Post Office moved in 1910 from near the Berry brothers&#x27; claim about two miles downstream from Ester City into J.C. Kinney&#x27;s general store in Ester. The post office retained the name of Berry until 1965, when it was finally changed to that of the town it had been in for 55 years. In the mid-1920s, the Fairbanks Exploration Company began buying claims on Ester Creek, started operations in 1929, and in 1933 built a mess hall for their camp in Ester. The buildings are now a historic landmark used until 2008 as a tourist attraction, restaurant, and hotel. The F.E. Company revitalized the town, reshaping it to do large-scale open-pit mining using enormous floating dredges and draglines. In the process, much of the original sites of Berry and Ester were removed.

===Since 1940===
The Ester Community Association was founded in 1941. In 1958, The F.E. Company sold their Ester camp, and it reopened under new management as a historic resort. The Cripple Creek Resort, which later became the Ester Gold Camp, featured a musical variety show including Robert W. Service&#x27;s poetry, held the Malemute Saloon, a local bar, featuring Service&#x27;s poem, &quot;&quot;, until the resort closed in 2007. The Malemute Saloon continues to operate on selected weekends during the summer, and often features live music by local bands. In 1974, the Ester Volunteer Fire Department was officially founded after nearly a century of bucket brigades. Gold mining continued on a small scale. In 1986, the Ester Community Association, working with the Fairbanks North Star Borough, built the Ester Community Park, which became a local center of social activity. In 2017, the Ester Community Association purchased the park from a local resident, holding chili feeds, music festivals, and other fundraising events.

In 1987, the eleven surviving buildings of the F.E. Company&#x27;s camp were listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1988, &quot;Mushing&quot; magazine began publication in Ester and continued to be produced and published there until it was sold in 2005. The town became the site of a sled dog stage race between Ester and Nenana and back again, the Fireplug Sled Dog Race, which was held for ten years, from 1990 to 2001, and in which many famous mushers participated, including Dean Seibold and Jeff King. In January 1999, the town&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The Ester Republic&quot;, was founded by Deirdre Helferrich; it was published regularly until 2015, and now is published sporadically. In August 1999, the John Trigg Ester Library (JTEL) opened a membership library named after a local resident who had started a book exchange in a nearby bar. In 2012, the JTEL received a donation of a local log cabin built in the 1940s and relocated many of its holdings to the new space. Today, the village features two saloons, five publishers, a library, a community hall, a secular chapel, a post office with its own zip code (99725), silversmiths and other artisans, numerous art studios, about two dozen homes, most of which were built by their owners, and three active gold mines. There is a fire station, a small store, and a secular chapel on the outskirts of the village.

The Ester Historic Society was founded in 2018. Its collection was donated by local residents and contains historical photographs, letters, and other documents. Along with the John Trigg Ester Library, the Ester Historic Society hosts talks and book readings about Ester and the surrounding area.

==Geography==
Ester is located at (64.855700, -147.978434).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.08%, is water.
===Ester Community Park===

Ester has a well-used park, maintained and improved by the Ester Community Association&#x27;s Park Committee and other volunteers from the community. The park has an ice rink that doubles as a basketball court in the summer, a children&#x27;s playground, a picnic pavilion, a stage, and a soccer field. The park, situated next to the Ester Volunteer Fire Department, is the site of numerous soccer games, Ester Football League games, broomball, the Fourth of July picnic, musical gatherings, and other events throughout the year. In the summer, there is a farmers&#x27; market on Thursday evenings where local farmers and gardeners sell their goods. In 2017, the Ester Community Association purchased the park from a local landowner.
===The village square===
Ester village wraps around a square at the foot of Ester Lump, the name of a bump on the side of Ester Dome. This &quot;town square&quot; is actually the parking lot of the Golden Eagle Saloon, divided in two sections by Main Street, but functions as a focal point and central gathering place during celebrations such as the Fourth of July and New Year&#x27;s Eve. Private residences, the John Trigg Ester Library, and the Golden Eagle Saloon surround the square.

=== Tailings ===
Due to the mining in the area, Ester is currently surrounded by piles of gravel and dirt tailings.

=== Climate ===
Ester has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;).
==Economy==
The local saw has it that &quot;Ester is still around because there is a McDonald&#x27;s in Fairbanks.&quot; This is true both culturally and economically. Many Ester residents are employed in Fairbanks or at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, although there are many small Ester-area businesses and self-employed people. The largest Ester employers are seasonal, with Judie Gumm Designs, and the local mines as the businesses with the most employees. Fairbanks provides a market for Ester products and services and thus helps to keep the small Ester economy alive. Because Fairbanks acts as a draw (due to its larger market and resources) for such things as big-box stores and fast food chains, Ester has been able to retain its mining village feel. This is important to Ester&#x27;s tourist economy, which capitalizes on the status of the gold camp buildings as a historic landmark. In fall 2007, the owners of the Ester Gold Camp (Malemute, Inc.) announced that they would not reopen the resort in 2008, but do open the camp bar (the Malemute Saloon) for a 30-day period each summer to retain the liquor license. This has had an effect on Ester&#x27;s summer economy, and resulted in the closure of at least two shops, in anticipation of the dearth of tourists.

In response to the closure of the Gold Camp, a group of local business owners have formed the EMCE (or Ester Ministry of Community Enterprise), which has been accepted as an ad hoc committee of the Ester Community Association, to support Ester-area businesses and craftspeople. The EMCE occasionally sponsors a local open-air farmers&#x27; market, and a Planting Day to beautify the village.

==Demographics==

Ester first appeared on the 1910 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village (erroneously as &quot;Esther&quot;). It did not appear again until 1940 and has reported on each successive census. In 1980, it was made a census-designated place (CDP).

==Notable people==
Clarence Berry was a successful miner who lived in the immediate vicinity of Ester, at No. 8 Below Discovery Claim.

Richard A. Fineberg is an investigative journalist living in Ester who specializes in petroleum development and environment-related issues. He has lived in Alaska since 1969 and works as a freelance writer and consultant.

Painter Magnus Colcord &quot;Rusty&quot; Heurlin, 1895–1986. Rusty was born in Christanstad, Sweden, to American parents and raised in Wakefield, Massachusetts. He attended art classes at the Fenway School of Illustration in Boston. He first came to Alaska in 1916, to Valdez, but left the state during World War I. He returned to Alaska in 1924, and moved to Ester, where he remained until his death. Heurlin was known for his pastel palette and luminous skies and influenced many later Alaska artists.

Eleanor Loback Garwood (1919-1989) better known as Ida Lane Clausen, was for years a main attraction for the variety show at the Malemute Saloon. Born and raised in Blakely and Edison, Georgia, she played rag time piano, sang, danced and acted on stage, published a cookbook that continues to be distributed by the University of Alaska Fairbanks Cooperative Extension Agency, and wrote columns for the &quot;Fairbanks News-Miner&quot;.

==Wildlife==

Because the village is surrounded by boreal forests, moose, ermine, snowshoe hare, foxes, least shrew, lynx, American red squirrel, porcupine, red-backed vole, and other northern mammals are commonly seen in Ester. Coyotes and black bears are seasonal visitors. Wolves are occasionally spotted. Many bird species thrive in the area such as black capped chickadee, boreal chickadee, hawk owl, cliff swallow, hairy woodpecker, spruce grouse, ruffed grouse, ruby-crowned kinglet, trumpeter swan, Canada jay, raven, and pine grosbeak. Owls include great horned owl, boreal owl, and great grey owl.

Insects common in Ester include numerous species of bumblebees, hornets, yellow jackets, and wasps. Butterflies include Canadian swallowtail, mourning cloak, painted lady, arctic fritillary, Mormon fritillary, and clouded sulphur. Damselflies and dragonflies are also commonly spotted in Ester, as are several types of moths. There are over 35 different species of mosquitoes, some of which emerge while there is still snow on the ground in April.

==Ester culture==

===Agriculture and subsistence===
Fishing, hunting, and food gathering are important aspects of Alaskan living in general, both for recreation and for subsistence, and Ester is no exception. The community is zoned as rural, despite its proximity to the state&#x27;s second-largest city. Many Ester residents fish and/or hunt, and berry- and mushroom-picking are regular seasonal activities. Gardening has long been a part of Ester&#x27;s culture, and farming has been growing in popularity since 2000, which saw the establishment of Calypso Farm &amp; Ecology Center in the hills near the village. Calypso provides community-supported agriculture shares for over 80 families, with other CSAs starting up in the area. The Ester library has a seed library program. The John Trigg Ester Library has long had a small community garden at its grounds on Main Street, and expanded them in 2023 to include new beds at the future Passiv Haus community center/library grounds on Village Road.

===Art===
Ester has a strong art community, including painters, photographers, collagists, sculptors, metalsmiths, and woodworkers. It has hosted an annual intercontinental simultaneous art exhibit since 2000, the BiPolar Art Show, with the MAAG (the Mechanical Equipment Center Alternative Art Gallery) in McMurdo, Antarctica. Three commercial galleries and several private studios provide sales venues for local and other artists.

An informal mixed media &#x27;school of assemblage&#x27; may be said to exist in Ester: several local artists rely on dumpster finds, printed materials, and historically significant items in their artwork, with themes relating to religious iconography, local history, and political satire.

===Mining===
Mines, having been the central reason for the village&#x27;s existence for most of its history, are still important in Ester culture. Old dredge parts and mining equipment can be found in the forest that has grown up around the village since major dredging ended in the 1960s, some of which have been incorporated into artistic works. The Malemute Saloon&#x27;s variety show capitalizes on the town&#x27;s mining history, particularly the influence of Clarence Berry, whose mine at 8 Below Discovery Claim was the largest and most successful in the Ester area during its early history. Ester Dome continues to attract large mining concerns, and several small-scale gold mines provide residents with income.
===Music===
Ester has a vibrant local music culture, and is the site of several annual music festivals: Angry Young &amp; Poor (also known as AYP), a free all-day concert oriented toward area youth; the Fairbanks Summer Folk Fest, a 35-year old folk festival; the LiBerry Music Festival &amp; Pie Throwdown, a fundraiser for the John Trigg Ester Library; and Ester Fest, a family-friendly musical fundraiser for the Ester Community Park which held its inaugural festival in 2017. An old time string band gathering, the Ester Jelly Jam, has an open jam occasionally on Sunday afternoons at Hartung Hall. A local group, the Lost Dog Old-Time String Band, hosts a monthly square/contra dance there. Impromptu music jams occur nightly on the saloon porches in the summer, and every Sunday in the winter. Sundays at the Golden Eagle are smoke free. Area venues and events regularly feature local, live music.

=== Parade ===
The Ester Community Association sponsors an annual Fourth of July parade that travels from the village square on Main Street past the post office, turning left onto Old Nenana Highway and ending about one mile away at the Ester Community Park. The parade features giant puppets, a children&#x27;s bike brigade, small scale floats frequently with satirical themes, antique cars and trucks, and dancing by the crew of the Ester Volunteer Fire Department or other groups. Summer residents of Calypso Farm throw vegetables to the crowd, and local politicians and community organizations hand out literature and candy. Lady Liberty and Uncle Sam are usually in the parade. Prizes vary from year to year, but usually include Best Bribe, the Golden Banana, or Best Choreography. The Red Hackle Pipe Band, a local music group which plays authentic Scottish bagpipes, drums, and flutes, traditionally begins the parade. The parade is followed by a community potluck featuring a pig roast, live music, and games. A local water delivery business, Water Wagon, sprays water on children and others who want to cool off. One local newspaper, the Fairbanks News-Miner, wrote this of the 2017 parade: &quot;The people of Ester’s eccentric brand of patriotism was on display once more at the Fourth of July parade and potluck Tuesday afternoon.&quot;

===Politics===
Ester tends to be a liberal and left-leaning area within the Fairbanks North Star Borough. In the 2016 presidential election, 54% of the votes went to Democrat compared to 32% for Republican Donald Trump. There was a wide range in election results in the precincts surrounding Ester; results ranged from 18% to 62% for Clinton, and from 20% to 70% for Trump. In the 2018 election for governor, Democrat Mark Begich received 295 votes (65%) compared to 139 votes (31%) for Republican Mike Dunleavy.

The Ester voting precinct typically has relatively high voter turnout (~30% or more) in municipal elections (precinct 130 in District 08 ). Ursa Major distillery serves as the precinct&#x27;s polling place; in years past polling took place in the fire department, and the community center, Hartung Hall. Party affiliation tends strongly toward the Democrats, followed by the Republicans, with Greens and Alaska Independence Party voters in a rough tie for third. The majority of Ester&#x27;s residents are listed on state records as unaffiliated or undeclared.

<text>Fairbanks is a home rule city and the borough seat of the Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, United States. Fairbanks is the largest city in the interior region of Alaska and the second largest in the state. The 2020 census put the population of the city proper at 32,515 and the population of the Fairbanks North Star Borough at 95,655, making it the second most populous metropolitan area in Alaska, after Anchorage. The Metropolitan Statistical Area encompasses all of the Fairbanks North Star Borough and is the northernmost metropolitan statistical area in the United States, located by road ( by air) south of the Arctic Circle.

In August 1901, E. T. Barnette founded a trading post on the south bank of the Chena River. A gold discovery near the trading post sparked the Fairbanks Gold Rush, and many miners moved to the area. There was a boom in construction, and in November 1903, the area&#x27;s residents voted to incorporate Fairbanks as a city. Barnette became the first mayor, and the city flourished during the gold rush. By World War I, the population had plunged, but rose again during the Great Depression as the price of gold increased.

During the 1940s and 1950s, the city became a staging area for the construction of military depots during World War II and the Cold War. Fort Wainwright, previously named Ladd Field, was built east of the city beginning in 1938 and is operated by the U.S. Army. After the discovery of the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field in 1968, the city became a supply point for the oil field, as well as for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. With the establishment of the Fairbanks North Star Borough in 1964, the city became borough seat. Tourism is also a factor in Fairbanks&#x27; economy.

Fairbanks is in the Tanana Valley, straddling the Chena River near its confluence with the Tanana River. The Tanana River marks the city&#x27;s southern border, and the Tanana Flats, a large area of marsh and bog, is south of the river. Fairbanks is the coldest city in the United States with a population of at least 10,000 people. Monthly mean temperatures range from in January to in July. In winter, Fairbanks&#x27; location in the Tanana Valley causes cold air to accumulate in the city and warm air to rise up the hills to the north, and the city experiences one of the biggest temperature inversions on Earth.

Fairbanks is home to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the founding campus of the University of Alaska system, established in 1917. Fairbanks International Airport is located southwest of the central business district of the city; Fairbanks is the smallest city in the United States with regularly scheduled non-stop international flights.

==History==

=== Native American presence ===

Athabascan peoples have used the area for thousands of years, although there is no known permanent Alaska Native settlement at the site of Fairbanks. An archaeological site excavated on the grounds of the University of Alaska Fairbanks uncovered a Native camp about 3,500 years old, with older remains found at deeper levels. From evidence gathered at the site, archaeologists surmise that Native activities in the area were limited to seasonal hunting and fishing as frigid temperatures precluded berry gathering. In addition, archaeological sites on the grounds of nearby Fort Wainwright date back well over 10,000 years. Arrowheads excavated from the University of Alaska Fairbanks site matched similar items found in Asia, providing some of the first evidence that humans arrived in North America via the Bering Strait land bridge in deep antiquity.

=== European settlers ===
Captain E. T. Barnette founded Fairbanks in August 1901 while headed to Tanacross (or Tanana Crossing, where the Valdez–Eagle trail crossed the Tanana River), where he intended to set up a trading post. The steamboat on which Barnette was a passenger, the &quot;Lavelle Young&quot;, ran aground while attempting to negotiate shallow water. Barnette, along with his party and supplies, were deposited along the banks of the Chena River upstream from its confluence with the Tanana River. The sight of smoke from the steamer&#x27;s engines caught the attention of gold prospectors working in the hills to the north, most notably an Italian immigrant named Felice Pedroni (better known as Felix Pedro) and his partner Tom Gilmore. The two met Barnette where he disembarked and convinced him of the potential of the area. Barnette set up his trading post at the site, still intending to eventually make it to Tanacross. Teams of gold prospectors soon congregated in and around the newly founded Fairbanks; they built drift mines, dredges, and lode mines in addition to panning and sluicing.

After some urging by James Wickersham, who later moved the seat of the Third Division court from Eagle to Fairbanks, the settlement was named after Charles W. Fairbanks, a Republican senator from Indiana and later the twenty-sixth vice president of the United States, serving under Theodore Roosevelt during his second term.

In these early years of settlement, the Tanana Valley was an important agricultural center for Alaska until the establishment of the Matanuska Valley Colonization Project and the town of Palmer in 1935. Agricultural activity still occurs today in the Tanana Valley, but mostly to the southeast of Fairbanks in the communities of Salcha and Delta Junction. During the early days of Fairbanks, its vicinity was a major producer of agricultural goods. What is now the northern reaches of South Fairbanks was originally the farm of Paul J. Rickert, who came from nearby Chena in 1904 and operated a large farm until his death in 1938. Farmers Loop Road and Badger Road, loop roads north and east (respectively) of Fairbanks, were also home to major farming activity. Badger Road is named for Harry Markley Badger, an early resident of Fairbanks who later established a farm along the road and became known as &quot;the Strawberry King&quot;. Ballaine and McGrath Roads, side roads of Farmers Loop Road, were also named for prominent local farmers, whose farms were in the immediate vicinity of their respective namesake roads. Despite early efforts by the Alaska Loyal League, the Tanana Valley Agriculture Association and William Fentress Thompson, the editor-publisher of the &quot;Fairbanks Daily News-Miner&quot;, to encourage food production, agriculture in the area was never able to fully support the population, although it came close in the 1920s.

The construction of Ladd Army Airfield starting in 1939, part of a larger effort by the federal government during the New Deal and World War II to install major infrastructure in the territory for the first time, fostered an economic and population boom in Fairbanks which extended beyond the end of the war. In the 1940s the Canol pipeline extended north from Whitehorse for a few years. The Haines - Fairbanks 626 mile long 8&quot; petroleum products pipeline was constructed during the period 1953–55. The presence of the U.S. military has remained strong in Fairbanks. Ladd became Fort Wainwright in 1960; the post was annexed into Fairbanks city limits during the 1980s.

Fairbanks suffered from several floods in its first seven decades, whether from ice jams during spring breakup or heavy rainfall. The first bridge crossing the Chena River, a wooden structure built in 1904 to extend Turner Street northward to connect with the wagon roads leading to the gold mining camps, often washed out before a permanent bridge was constructed at Cushman Street in 1917 by the Alaska Road Commission. On August 14, 1967, after record rainfall upstream, the Chena began to surge over its banks, flooding almost the entire town of Fairbanks overnight. This disaster led to the creation of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project, which built and operates the Moose Creek Dam in the Chena River and accompanying spillway. The project was designed to prevent a repetition of the 1967 flood by being able to divert water in the Chena upstream from Fairbanks into the Tanana River, thus bypassing the city.

===Railroad history===

After large-scale gold mining began north of Fairbanks, miners wanted to build a railroad from the steamboat docks on the Chena River to the mine sites in the hills north of the city. The result was the Tanana Mines Railroad, which started operations in September 1905, using what had been the first steam locomotive in the Yukon Territory. In 1907, the railroad was reorganized and named the Tanana Valley Railroad. The railroad continued expanding until 1910, when the first gold boom began to falter and the introduction of automobiles into Fairbanks took business away from the railroad. Despite these problems, railroad backers envisioned a rail line extending from Fairbanks to Seward on the Gulf of Alaska, home to the Alaska Central Railway.

In 1914, the U.S. Congress appropriated $35 million for construction of the Alaska Railroad system, but work was delayed by the outbreak of World War I. Three years later, the Alaska Railroad purchased the Tanana Valley Railroad, which had suffered from the wartime economic problems. Rail workers built a line extending northwest from Fairbanks, then south to Nenana, where President Warren G. Harding hammered in the ceremonial final spike in 1923. The rail yards of the Tanana Valley Railroad were converted for use by the Alaska Railroad, and Fairbanks became the northern end of the line and its second-largest depot.

From 1923 to 2004, the Alaska Railroad&#x27;s Fairbanks terminal was in downtown Fairbanks, just north of the Chena River. In May 2005, the Alaska Railroad opened a new terminal northwest of downtown, and that terminal is in operation today. In summer, the railroad operates tourist trains to and from Fairbanks, and it operates occasional passenger trains throughout the year. The majority of its business through Fairbanks is freight. The railroad is planning an expansion of the rail line from Fairbanks to connect the city via rail with Delta Junction, about southeast.

===Road history===


As the transportation hub for Interior Alaska, Fairbanks features extensive road, rail, and air connections to the rest of Alaska and outside of Alaska. At Fairbanks&#x27; founding, the only way to reach the new city was via steamboat on the Chena River. In 1904, money intended to improve the Valdez-Eagle Trail was diverted to build a branch trail, giving Fairbanks its first overland connection to the outside world. The resulting Richardson Highway was created in 1910 after Gen. Wilds P. Richardson upgraded it to a wagon road. In the 1920s, it was improved further and made navigable by automobiles, but it was not paved until 1957.

Fairbanks&#x27; road connections were improved in 1927, when the Steese Highway connected the city to the Yukon River at the gold-mining community of Circle. In 1942, the Alaska Highway connected the Richardson Highway to the Canadian road system, allowing road travel from the rest of the United States to Fairbanks, which is considered the unofficial end of the highway. Because of World War II, civilian traffic was not permitted on the highway until 1948.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of roads were built to connect Fairbanks to the oil fields of Prudhoe Bay. The Elliott Highway was built in 1957 to connect Fairbanks to Livengood, southern terminus of the Dalton Highway, which ends in Deadhorse on the North Slope. West of the Dalton intersection, the Elliott Highway extends to Manley Hot Springs on the Tanana River. To improve logistics in Fairbanks during construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, the George Parks Highway was built between Fairbanks and Palmer in 1971.

Until 1940, none of Fairbanks&#x27; surface streets were paved. The outbreak of World War II interrupted plans to pave most of the city&#x27;s roads, and a movement toward large-scale paving did not begin until 1953, when the city paved 30 blocks of streets. During the late 1950s and the 1960s, the remainder of the city&#x27;s streets were converted from gravel roads to asphalt surfaces. Few have been repaved since that time; a 2008 survey of city streets indicated the average age of a street in Fairbanks was 31 years.

==Geography==
===Topography===

Fairbanks is in the central Tanana Valley, straddling the Chena River near its confluence with the Tanana River. Immediately north of the city is a chain of hills that rises gradually until it reaches the White Mountains and the Yukon River. The city&#x27;s southern border is the Tanana River. South of the river is the Tanana Flats, an area of marsh and bog that stretches for more than until it rises into the Alaska Range, which is visible from Fairbanks on clear days. To the east and west are low valleys separated by ridges of hills up to above sea level.

The Tanana Valley is crossed by many low streams and rivers that flow into the Tanana River. In Fairbanks, the Chena River flows southwest until it empties into the Tanana. Noyes Slough, which heads and foots off the Chena River, creates Garden Island, a district connected to the rest of Fairbanks by bridges and culverted roads.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of ; of it is land and of it (2.48%) is water.

===Location===

The city is extremely far north, close to 16 degrees north of the Pacific border between the U.S. and Canada. It is on roughly the same parallel as the northern Swedish city of Skellefteå and Finnish city of Oulu, just south of the Arctic Circle. Because of this, the white night or &quot;Midnight Sun&quot; phenomenon occurs here around the summer solstice. Due to its warm summers, Fairbanks is south of the arctic tree line.

===Climate===
Fairbanks&#x27;s climate is classified as a humid continental climate bordering on a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot; bordering on &quot;Dfc&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Dclc&quot; bordering on &quot;Eclc&quot;, although some portions of Fairbanks MSA like College firmly classifies as subarctic), with long, very cold winters and short, warm summers. October through February are the snowiest months, and there is usually additional snow from March to May. On average, the season&#x27;s first accumulating snowfall and first inch of snow fall on October 1 and 11, respectively; the average last inch and last accumulating snowfall are respectively on March 29 and April 15, though there can be snow flurries in May. The snowpack is established by October 18, on average, and remains until April 23. Snow occasionally arrives early and in large amounts. On September 13, 1992, of snow fell in the city, bending trees still laden with fall leaves. That September was also one of the snowiest on record, as fell, compared to the 1991-2020 median of only a trace during the month. November and December are the snowiest months, while in contrast, March and April are not very snowy and are typically very dry months in central Alaska. The snowiest season on record lasted from July 1990 to June 1991 with a snowfall of , while the least snowy period recorded was from July 1918 to June 1919 with a snowfall of only .

The average first and last dates with a freezing temperature are September 11 and May 14, respectively, allowing an average growing season of 119 days. However, freezes have occurred in June, July, and August; the last light frost is often in early June; and the first light fall frost is often in late August or early September. The plant hardiness zone is 2 with annual mean minimums below -40.

Fairbanks is the coldest city in the United States among cities with a population of at least 10,000 people. Normal monthly mean temperatures range from in January to in July. On average, temperatures reach and on 7.0 and 13 days annually, respectively, and the last winter that failed to reach the former mark was that of 2022–23. Between 1995 and 2008, inclusive, Fairbanks failed to record a temperature of . The highest recorded temperature in Fairbanks was on July 28, 1919, just a degree cooler than Alaska-wide record high temperature of , recorded in Fort Yukon. The lowest was on January 14, 1934. The warmest calendar year in Fairbanks was 2019, when the average annual temperature was , while the coldest was 1956 with an annual mean temperature of . The warmest month has been July 1975 with a monthly mean of and the coldest January 1906 which averaged . Low temperatures below have been recorded in every month outside June through September. The record cold daily &quot;maximum&quot; is on January 18, 1906, and the record warm daily minimum is on June 26, 1915; the only other occurrence of a daily minimum was June 25, 2013, in the midst of a particularly warm summer.

These widely varying temperature extremes are due to three main factors: temperature inversions, daylight, and wind direction. In winter, Fairbanks&#x27; low-lying location at the bottom of the Tanana Valley causes cold air to accumulate in and around the city. Warmer air rises to the tops of the hills north of Fairbanks, while the city itself experiences one of the biggest temperature inversions on Earth. Heating through sunlight is limited because of Fairbanks&#x27;s high-latitude location. At the winter solstice, the center of the sun&#x27;s disk is less than two degrees over the horizon (1.7 degrees) at the local noon (not the time zone noon). Fairbanks experiences 3 hours and 41 minutes of sunlight on December 21 and 22. At the summer solstice, about 182 days later, on June 20 and 21, Fairbanks receives 21 hours and 49 minutes of sunlight. After sunset, twilight is bright enough to allow daytime activities without any electric lights, since the center of the sun&#x27;s disk is just 1.7 degrees below horizon. During winter, the direction of the wind also causes large temperature swings in Fairbanks. When the wind blows from any direction but the south, average weather ensues. Wind from the south can carry warm, moist air from the Gulf of Alaska, greatly warming temperatures. When coupled with a chinook wind, temperatures well above freezing often result. For example, in the record warm January 1981, Fairbanks&#x27; average maximum temperature was and 15 days that month had high temperatures above freezing. Meanwhile, during a spell of sustained chinook winds from December 4 to 8, 1934, the temperature topped for five consecutive days. Unusual for such a cold place, Fairbanks has experienced temperatures of or higher in all 12 months.

In addition to the chinook wind, Fairbanks experiences a handful of other unusual meteorological conditions. In summer, dense wildfire smoke accumulates in the Tanana Valley, affecting the weather and causing health concerns. When temperature inversions arise in winter, heavy ice fog often results. Ice fog occurs when air is too cold to absorb additional moisture, such as that released by automobile engines or human breath. Instead of dissipating, the water freezes into microscopic crystals that are suspended in the air, forming fog. Another one of Fairbanks&#x27; unusual occurrences is the prevalence of the aurora borealis, commonly called the northern lights, which are visible on average more than 200 days per year in the vicinity of Fairbanks. The northern lights are not visible in the summer months due to the 24 hour daylight of the midnight sun. Fairbanks also has extremely low seasonal lag; the year&#x27;s warmest month is July, which averages only warmer than June. Average daily temperatures begin to fall by late July and more markedly in August, which on average is cooler than June.

From 1949 to 2018, Fairbanks&#x27;s mean annual temperature has risen by , a change comparable to the Alaska-wide average; winter was the season with the highest increase, at , while autumn had the smallest, at only . However, the mean annual temperature increase from 1976 to 2018 in Fairbanks stood at a more moderate ; this stepwise temperature change, also observed elsewhere in Alaska, is explained by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation shifting from a negative phase to a positive phase from 1976 onward.

==Arts and culture==


===Attractions===

The city of Fairbanks and the greater Fairbanks area is home to a number of attractions and events, which draw visitors from outside of Alaska throughout the year. Summer tourist traffic primarily consists of cruise ship passengers who purchase package tours which include travel to Fairbanks. Many of these tourists spend one or more nights at a local hotel and visit one or more attractions. Tourism the rest of the year is mostly concentrated around the winter season, centered upon the northern lights, ice carving and winter sports. In addition, other events draw visitors from within Alaska, mostly from the community&#x27;s trading area throughout Interior Alaska and the North Slope.

Attractions include:
*Creamer&#x27;s Field Migratory Waterfowl Refuge
*Golden Days Parade (July)
*Midnight Sun Game (June 21)
*Pioneer Park
*World Eskimo Indian Olympics (July)
*Tanana Valley State Fair (July/August)
*World Ice Art Championships (February)

==Sports==
Fairbanks offers a variety of winter sports, including cross-country skiing and dog mushing. The city hosted the 2014 Arctic Winter Games from March 15–22, 2014. Fairbanks has also held skiing events that include the 2003 Junior Olympic Cross Country Ski Championship and the 2008 and 2009 U.S. Cross Country Distance Nationals. A 50k race called the Sonot Kkaazoot is held annually in Fairbanks, as are the Fairbanks Town Series races and the Chest Medicine Distance Series races.

Fairbanks is also home to the Yukon Quest, an international 1,000 mile sled dog race that is considered one of the toughest in the world. The race alternates its starting and finishing points each year between Fairbanks, Alaska and Whitehorse, Yukon.

Hockey is also present in Fairbanks. Two teams include the University of Alaska Fairbanks Nanooks men&#x27;s team ice hockey, which plays at the Carlson Center, and the Fairbanks Ice Dogs. The Fairbanks Ice Dogs, a junior hockey team in the North American Hockey League, play at the Big Dipper Ice Arena. Prior to the formation of the Ice Dogs, the Fairbanks Gold Kings was formed as a league team by the Teamsters Local 959 in 1974. The team took on a life of its own beyond local league play, and played out of the Big Dipper for many years until moving to Colorado Springs, Colorado and becoming the Colorado Gold Kings in 1998.

The Alaska Goldpanners is a summer collegiate / semi-pro baseball team, playing home games at Growden Memorial Park. The park is home to the annual Midnight Sun Game, an annual tradition since 1906, played without artificial lights starting after ten at night on the summer solstice.

The city was briefly represented in the Indoor Football League by the Fairbanks Grizzlies.

Fairbanks is the starting and ending point for the Yukon 800 speedboat race, held annually in June.

==Parks and recreation==
Alaska State Parks operates the &quot;Chena River State Recreation Site&quot;, a park in the middle of Fairbanks with a campground, trails, and a boat launch.

== Government ==

Fairbanks is a regional center for most departments of the state of Alaska, though the vast majority of state jobs are based in either Anchorage or Juneau.

The majority of Fairbanks is politically conservative, with three distinct geographical areas representing different political perspectives. The western part of the city, centered on the University of Alaska Fairbanks, leans toward the Democratic Party. The downtown area and the eastern parts near Fort Wainwright lean slightly toward the Republican Party. The North Pole area farther east is heavily Republican and one of the most conservative parts of the state. Thus, many residents have noted that a neighborhood&#x27;s position on the map of Fairbanks (west to east) mirrors its political orientation (left to right).

===Municipal===
==== City ====
Fairbanks, unlike other larger cities in Alaska, still has separate borough and city governments. The City of Fairbanks was incorporated on November 10, 1903.

==== Borough ====
The Fairbanks North Star Borough, created by the Alaska Legislature under the Mandatory Borough Act of 1963, was incorporated on January 1, 1964.

===State===
At the state level, the city of Fairbanks is split between two state house districts: the 31st district, which includes the downtown area; and the 32nd district, which includes Fort Wainwright and western Badger. The city is represented in the state senate by Democrat Scott Kawasaki.

The Fairbanks North Star Borough comprises six house and three senate districts, with one house and senate districts not entirely within the boundary of the borough. The state senators for the borough are Democrat Scott Kawasaki and Republicans Robert Myers Jr. and Click Bishop. State house representatives are Democrats Maxine Dibert and Ashley Carrick, along with Republicans Will Stapp, Frank Tomaszewski, Mike Prax, and Mike Cronk.

Fairbanksans elected the first two Libertarian Party members to serve in a state legislature in the United States. Dick Randolph, who had previously served two terms in the Alaska House as a Republican, was first elected as a Libertarian in 1978 and re-elected in 1980. Ken Fanning was also elected to the House as a Libertarian in 1980. In the 1982 elections, Randolph ran unsuccessfully as the LP&#x27;s nominee for Governor of Alaska, while Fanning lost re-election to the House to Democrat Niilo Koponen, following redistricting.

Downtown Fairbanks also voted for Democrat Mark Begich in his campaigns for U.S. Senate and governor, and for independent Bill Walker as governor in 2014.

===Federal===
The district centered on downtown Fairbanks typically votes for Republican candidates for president, although Joe Biden nearly won it in 2020. The boundaries of the district have changed slightly in the elections listed here.

==Education==

The Fairbanks North Star Borough School District operates public schools serving the City of Fairbanks and the Fairbanks North Star Borough. The school board is made up 10 members in total, three of which only have advisory votes. They are elected to three year terms.

University of Alaska Fairbanks is the College census-designated place.

==Media==

Fairbanks&#x27; largest newspaper is the &quot;Fairbanks Daily News-Miner&quot;, which also includes a weekly entertainment guide, Latitude 65. A few other periodicals also serve Fairbanks and the Fairbanks North Star Borough: &quot;The Ester Republic&quot; and the University of Alaska Fairbanks student newspaper, the &quot;Sun Star&quot;.

Fairbanks is also served by television and radio. Leading radio stations include AM Stations KFAR 660 talk radio, KCBF 820 ESPN Radio Network, KFBX 970 talk radio and KJNP 1170 religious radio. FM stations include 88.3 popular Christian, KUAC 89.9 National Public Radio, KSUA 91.5 University of Alaska, Fairbanks, KDJF (&quot;CHET FM&quot;) 93.5 everything country, KWDD 94.3 Alaska&#x27;s new country, KXLR 95.9 classic rock, KYSC 96.9 soft rock, KWLF 98.1-&quot;Wolf 98.1&quot; top 40, KJNP-FM 100.3 religious radio, KAKQ-FM 101.1-&quot;Magic 101.1&quot; pop music, KIAK-FM 102.5 country music, KTDZ 103.9-&quot;K-TED&quot; adult hits, KKED 104.7 rock music, KQHE 92.7 religious talk, and KDFJ-LP 105.9 religious radio.

Fairbanks&#x27; major television affiliates are KATN (ABC, Fox, The CW Plus), KUAC-TV (PBS), KTVF (NBC), KFXF-LD (MyNetworkTV), and KXDF-CD (CBS). Cable TV is available from GCI. Satellite TV from Dish Network and DirecTV is also available.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Bus====
Public transportation has been provided by the Metropolitan Area Commuter System, an agency of the borough government, since 1977. Bus service links much of the urban Fairbanks area, with most routes connecting at the downtown transit center. University Bus Lines, a private company, existed for several decades before MACS started. The company, which was owned first by Paul Greimann and later by Walt Conant, mainly linked downtown Fairbanks with the university campus and the military bases.

====Air====

Fairbanks International Airport serves as a major hub for Alaska air travel. Several regional and charter airlines use or have used the location as their main base of operations due to its central location in the state. Commercial airlines also connect Fairbanks to the lower 48 and select international destinations. Fairbanks is the smallest city in the United States to be served by transatlantic flights, as Condor operates direct flights to Frankfurt in the summer tourist season.

===Utilities===
Electricity is provided by the Golden Valley Electric Association, an electric cooperative formed in 1946 to serve areas that the City of Fairbanks&#x27; Municipal Utilities System (FMUS) didn&#x27;t serve. In 1997, GVEA purchased the electric distribution system from FMUS. The downtown coal fired power plant was also purchased by Usibelli Coal Mine under the subsidiary Aurora Energy and contracts to provide power to GVEA. There are four steam turbines fueled by coal. Interior Alaska is not connected to the electrical grid of the contiguous United States and Canada, but a 138kv transmission line constructed in 1985 connects Fairbanks with electric companies serving the Southcentral Alaska area: Matanuska Electric Association, Chugach Electric Association and Homer Electric Association. Until 2019, GVEA held the world record for the largest rechargeable battery BESS, which weighs approximately 1,300 tons. The battery was installed to help bridge the gaps that occur during power outages from the transmission line to Southcentral Alaska. The battery can provide 25 megawatts of electric for 15 minutes or provide power for 7 minutes to about 12,000 homes.

The University of Alaska Fairbanks operates its own coal-fired generating station on campus, providing electricity and steam heat to university buildings. As of 2019, a new fluidized bed 20 megawatt coal-fired power plant was completed, replacing the old dual boiler system

Until 1996, telephone service was provided by the Fairbanks Municipal Utilities System (FMUS), owned by the City of Fairbanks. In that year, the voters in the City of Fairbanks authorized the sale of FMUS, which included telephone, electrical, and sewer and water. The telephone system was sold to PTI, a subsidiary of Pacific Power and Light, a subsidiary itself of PacifiCorp. However, PacifiCorp&#x27;s purchase of The Energy Group, a diversified energy company with operations in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the U.S. with debt put pressure on PacifiCorp and they sold the telephone holdings to CenturyTel. CenturyTel didn&#x27;t hang onto it long, not being interested in the Alaska portfolio they had acquired from PacifiCorp. They sold the telephone utility to Alaska Communications, Inc., a private company, some of whom were Alaskans involved in the prior PTI company. Alaska Communications (ACS) had promised that Fairbanks was to be the corporate headquarters with a new building at the corner of Cushman St. and 1st Avenue. That changed as, in the process of acquiring the Fairbanks-based telephone utility, the Anchorage Telephone Utility came up for sale, ACS purchased it and Anchorage became the headquarters for Alaska Communications Systems.

General Communications Inc. (GCI) has competed against ACS in Fairbanks since 1997 with installation of an earth station on the site of the former satellite monitoring system of the European Space Research Organization, now the European Space Agency. GCI purchased ACS&#x27;s mobile phone service from ACS in 2014, when ACS had a lot of debt. Other mobile providers are national companies AT&amp;T Mobility and Verizon Wireless.

A pair of fiber optic cables provide long-distance telephone and Internet service. One parallels the Parks Highway and connects Fairbanks to Anchorage, while the other parallels the Richardson Highway and connects Fairbanks to Valdez. A third, spur fiber optic cable parallels the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and connects Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay. In 2020, Matanuska Telephone Association&#x27;s subsidiary MTA Fiber Holdings has recently completed the AlCan One fiber installation from its prior connections from Wasilla to Fairbanks and North Pole, continuing down the Alaska Highway to the Canadian border where it connects with Canadian carriers.

Broadband Internet access is provided by GCI, ACS, Ace Tekk and a handful of satellite Internet and wireless Internet services.

==Law enforcement==
The Fairbanks Police Department is the primary law enforcement agency responsible for the city. Recently the police department has had trouble keeping their employees. In 2021 the &quot;Fairbanks Daily News-Miner&quot; reported that &quot;The Fairbanks Police Department hired 45 officers in the past five years and lost 50 in the same time frame.&quot; The department also reported that out of 45 sworn officer positions, only 34 were filled, or about 75%. Troop D of the Alaska State Troopers supplements the Police Department with additional personnel.

==Archaeology==
Coordinates: 64°43&#x27;30&quot;N, 147°13&#x27;05&quot;W

Chugwater is a large (100 x 165m) site on the east summit of Moose Creek Bluff near the town of North Pole, Alaska 25 km southeast of Fairbanks. Samples of charcoal and sedimentary organics obtained from this site demonstrate human occupation going back before 13,000 years ago.

The site is located between the Chena and Tanana Rivers. Moose Creek Bluff contains the only pictographs documented in interior Alaska (Giddings 1941).
&quot;Strata in some areas [of Moose Creek] contain artifacts diagnostic of much of the past 11,000 years of prehistory in sediments averaging 30cm deep, and seldom exceeding 50cm. Lively (1988) identified three separate components:

Component 1, a basal non-microblade level with teardrop-shaped (Chindadn) bifaces and small endscrapers similar to Nenana Valley assemblages antedating 10,600 BP (Powers &amp; Hoffecker 1989);

Component 2, a microblade-bearing level with asymmetric bifacial points or knives attributed to the early Denali complex or American Paleoarctic tradition (APT); and

Component 3, an upper microblade-bearing level with notched and lanceolate points typical of Tuktu or Late Denali sites of the interior. Maitland (1986:115) also attributed several artifacts in the upper levels to an incursion or influence by Norton peoples.&quot;
Obsidian used at Moose Creek came from the Wiki Peak source near the Canada–United States border. Such obsidian was also recovered at the Broken Mammoth site, and it dates to before 13,000 cal BP.

<text>North Pole is a small city in the Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, United States. Incorporated in 1953, it is part of the Fairbanks metropolitan statistical area. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 2,243, up from 2,117 in 2010. Despite its name, the city is about south of Earth&#x27;s geographic North Pole and south of the Arctic Circle.

==Description==

The city is a summertime attraction for tourists visiting nearby Fairbanks and, due to its location on the Richardson Highway, those traveling to and from the Alaska Highway and Valdez. North Pole was home to two oil refineries, the town&#x27;s major industry aside from tourism, but closed because of sulfolane contamination in groundwater. The larger refinery, operated by Flint Hills Resources, was a major source of jet fuel for Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. Tanker car traffic on the Alaska Railroad, entering and leaving the refinery, frequently bisects the city.

North Pole&#x27;s biggest attraction is a gift shop named Santa Claus House, the modern-day incarnation of a trading post (gift shop) established in the town&#x27;s early days. The Santa Claus House is known for the world&#x27;s largest fiberglass statue of Santa Claus outside. A small group of domesticated reindeer are just outside.

Before Christmas each year, the USPS post office in North Pole receives hundreds of thousands of letters to Santa Claus, and thousands more from people wanting the town&#x27;s postmark on their Christmas greeting cards to their families. It advertises the ZIP code 99705 as the ZIP code of Santa. A community program also responds to letters addressed to 1 Santa Claus Lane.

Christmas-themed streets in North Pole include Santa Claus Lane, St. Nicholas Drive, Snowman Lane, and Kris Kringle Drive. Street lights in the city are decorated in a candy cane motif, and many local businesses have similar decorations. The city&#x27;s firetrucks and ambulances are all red, while the police cars are green and white. The city also has an all-female flat-track Roller Derby league, the North Pole Babes in Toyland (NPBT), whose athletes have Christmas and North Pole-inspired Skater names.

North Pole has some of the least expensive residential real estate in Alaska; the median home price there is $211,184 in 2014.

==History==

The Richardson Highway south of Fairbanks led to an assortment of subdivided and unsubdivided homesteads between Ladd Field and 26 Mile Field in the 1940s and 1950s.

The area that formed the central city of North Pole was homesteaded in 1944 by Bon V. and Bernice Davis. Their son, T. Neil Davis, wrote &quot;Battling Against Success&quot; in 1997, a fictionalized account of homestead life. The Alaska Railroad established a siding on the Davis homestead as part of its branch line to Eielson Air Force Base, naming the siding Davis. This name temporarily became associated with the fledgling settlement.

In 1952, Dahl and Gaske Development Company purchased the Davis homestead, subdivided it, and renamed it North Pole, in hopes of attracting a toy manufacturer to the area. The City of North Pole was incorporated on January 15, 1953, from portions of the Davis homestead and the adjacent homestead of James Ford. Ford was named the first mayor, with Everett Dahl serving on the first city council.

Another member of that first council was Conrad B. Miller. Miller, who came to Fairbanks in 1949, opened a trading post along the highway in 1952. The business became known as the Santa Claus House, and has evolved over the years into the current roadside attraction. The business was also home to North Pole&#x27;s first post office, serving in that capacity for almost 20 years. Another trading post in the community was operated by Lucius Cunningham and his family. The town&#x27;s economy largely depended on these two businesses until the 1970s, when the current four-lane Richardson Highway was built, bypassing Davis Subdivision, which was effectively its downtown.

The Earth Resources refinery (now operated by Flint Hills Resources) began operations in August 1977. It is connected to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System by several feeder pipelines operated by Golden Valley Electric Association, mostly following along the Laurence Road section line. The years after its construction saw the construction of the North Pole Plaza, a large enclosed shopping mall along the Richardson Highway. A standalone high school and increased subdivision development in previously rural areas immediately outside the city followed before the real estate market temporarily collapsed during the 1980s.

An interchange was constructed along the Richardson, where the highway intersects with the eastern end of Badger Road and the northern end of Santa Claus Lane, during the early 1990s. In the late 2000s, the northern portion of Santa Claus Lane was rebuilt to accommodate three consecutive roundabouts, serving the interchange and a nearby frontage road intersection. Another interchange was constructed on the Richardson at Dawson Road, at the far eastern edge of city limits. These improvements eliminated a number of at-grade access points to the Richardson, which had accumulated a decades-long history of serious accidents.
On April 22, 2006, police arrested several students at North Pole Middle School for allegedly plotting a school shooting, much along the lines of the Columbine High School massacre. &quot;Death in Santaland&quot;, a TV documentary about the town and the foiled school shooting plot, was made by the British journalist Jon Ronson and broadcast on the television channel More 4 in 2007.

The city government has had an often contentious history. A past mayor, Jeff Jacobson, was criticized for maintaining his full-time mayor&#x27;s job while at the same time working full-time as a teacher at North Pole Middle School. In 2004, he sent a letter (and a lump of coal) to U.S. Senator John McCain about a comment he made regarding why the city&#x27;s &quot;elves&quot; needed money for a recreation project that he considered a pork barrel project.

The current mayor of North Pole is Michael Welch. The city council consists of six members serving staggered three-year terms, with municipal elections held each October. In 2022, the city council consists of Santa Claus (2019–2022), Aino Welch (2020–2023), DeJohn Cromer (2020–2023), David Skipps (2021–2024), and Anton Keller (2021–2024).

In 2014, Americans for Prosperity quickly pulled an ad campaign in Alaska after Koch Industries closed the Flint Hills Resources Refinery in North Pole.

==Geography==
North Pole is located at (). It is southeast of Fairbanks on the Richardson Highway. The city is about south of Earth&#x27;s geographic North Pole.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and (0.47%) is water. The city is to the north and east of the Tanana River, though access to the river is not easy due to the extensive system of levees. Beaver Springs Slough meanders through the heart of the city, emptying into Chena Slough.

North Pole is the recommended city name for all of ZIP Code 99705, which stretches between Fort Wainwright and Eielson Air Force Base, and between the Chena River and the Tanana River, including the census-designated places of Badger, which spans subdivisions connecting the eastern edge of Fairbanks and North Pole, and Moose Creek.

===Climate===

North Pole has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;). Temperatures in North Pole are heavily affected by the amount of sunlight with almost no seasonal lag effect from solar radiation. North Pole&#x27;s Santa Claus House is actually closed during the week in January and February due to extreme cold in those months. Due to being landlocked and protected by mountain ranges from marine influences, North Pole, much like the rest of the Alaskan Interior, sees little seasonal lag and much greater seasonal temperature swings than areas along the coast such as Anchorage, with winters that can dip to many tens of degrees below zero Fahrenheit with average lows remaining below 0 from November 5 to March 18, and summers that see many days in the 70s, 80s, and on occasion, even 90s F.

Extreme temperatures range from on January 5–6, 1975 up to on June 15, 1969, and June 25, 1983; the record cold daily maximum is , set on January 6, 1975, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is on June 22, 1987. The coldest day of the year averaged in the 2001 to 2020 normals, while the warmest night average was at . The coldest has been January 1971 with a mean temperature of , while the warmest month was June 2004 at ; the annual mean temperature has ranged from in 1975 to in 2019. North Pole has about 238.8 days a year with nighttime temperatures below , and 114.7 days a year with nighttime temperatures below .

<text>Covenant Life is a census-designated place (CDP) in Haines Borough, Alaska, United States. At the 2020 census the population was 25, down from 86 at the 2010 census.

It is a community of people with common religious beliefs, with a panel of church elders who set policy for the community&#x27;s common church, K-12 school, and private 4-year university, and a loose form of self- (municipal) government. An emphasis on community living is a key value in their lifestyle, such as taking most meals together in a common meeting place. The community was established during a Christian religious movement in the 1960s and 1970s, where many such communities were established in Alaska and Canada, with emphasis on self-sufficiency and at least partial agricultural independence. The latter lends to the term often used by outsiders as &quot;The Farm&quot;, in reference to a single such community. Modern technology is not forbidden, nor discouraged, but due to remoteness and complete lack of public utilities, it is present much less so than in American and Canadian culture.

==History==
Excursion Inlet was originally an Alaska Native settlement, one of several locations where the Huna Tlingit dispersed around 1750 (Little Ice Age) when the glaciers of present day Glacier Bay Basin advanced into Icy Strait. Excursion Inlet has had a fishing cannery since 1891. The current plant, constructed in 1918, still functions to this day. It mostly processes pink and chum salmon, as well as salmon roe, salmon caviar, halibut and sablefish. It is located near the mouth of the inlet, about west of Juneau. Its seasons run from late June to mid-September. Excursion Inlet Cannery is one of the largest fish canneries in the world and was acquired by Ocean Beauty Seafoods in 2003.
During the early stages of American involvement in World War II, the United States Army built a major barge terminal at Excursion Inlet. Capable of handling large ocean-going cargo ships and intended to be manned by thousands of soldiers, the terminal was built to serve as a logistics base for the Army&#x27;s efforts to liberate the Aleutian Islands from their Japanese invaders. However, by the time the terminal was completed in late 1943, the Aleutian Campaign was effectively over, and the terminal had no evident future purpose. When the facility&#x27;s existence became public knowledge in early 1945, newspapers decried it as a wasteful boondoggle, and the Army opted to quietly shut it down. German prisoners of war were later brought in to dismantle the base and salvage usable materials. The docks and some of the buildings were sold to the cannery and remain standing today.

<text>Haines (Tlingit: &quot;Deishú&quot;) is a census-designated place located in Haines Borough, Alaska, United States. It is in the northern part of the Alaska Panhandle and near Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. As of the 2020 census, the population of the Haines CDP was 1,657, down from 1,713 in 2010; it has 79.6% of Haines Borough&#x27;s total population.

==History==
The original Native name for Haines was Deishú, meaning &quot;end of the trail&quot;; it was named by the Chilkat group of the Tlingit. The name is derived from the fact that they could portage (carry) their canoes from the trail they used to trade with the interior. The trail began at the outlet of the Chilkat River and went to Dtehshuh; portaging saved of rowing around the Chilkat Peninsula.

The first European, George Dickinson, an agent for the North West Trading Company, settled at Dtehshuh in 1879. In 1881, the Chilkat asked Sheldon Jackson to send missionaries to the area. 

John Muir and Samuel Hall Young, a Presbyterian minister, were sent. Jackson built the Chilkat Mission and school at Dtehshuh in 1881, on land given to the church by the Chilkat. The Mission was renamed &quot;Haines&quot; in 1884 in honor of Francina E. Haines, the chairwoman of the committee that raised funds for its construction. Haines is the only town in Southeast Alaska to have been named after a woman. At the time, the boundary between Canada and the U.S. was disputed and vaguely defined. There were overlapping land claims from the United States&#x27; purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867 and British claims along the coast.

The Klondike Gold Rush of 1896–1899 changed the region greatly. Haines became a supply center for the Dalton Trail from Chilkat Inlet offered a route to the Yukon for prospectors. Gold was discovered from Haines in 1899 at the Porcupine District. The sudden importance of the region increased the urgency of fixing an exact boundary. There were reports that Canadian citizens were harassed by the U.S. as a deterrent to making any land claims. In 1898 the national governments agreed on a compromise, but the government of British Columbia rejected it. U.S. President McKinley proposed a ninety-nine year lease of a port near Haines, but Canada rejected that compromise.

The economy continued to grow and diversify. Four canneries were constructed around the mission by 1900. However, the completion of the White Pass and Yukon Route railway in neighboring Skagway that same year led to the Dalton Trail&#x27;s eventual abandonment and Haines&#x27; economic decline. In 1903, the Hay-Herbert Treaty entrusted the border decision to arbitration by a mixed tribunal of six members, three American and three Canadian–British, who determined in favor of the United States, resulting in the present-day border.

Fort William H. Seward, a United States Army installation, was constructed south of Haines and completed by 1904, on property donated by the mission from its holdings. In 1922, the fort was renamed Chilkoot Barracks. It was the only United States Army post in Alaska before World War II. During World War II, it was used as a supply point for some U.S. Army activities in Alaska. 

In 1943, the US Army built the Haines Highway to Haines Junction, Yukon

The fort was deactivated in 1946 and sold as surplus property to a group of investors (Ted Gregg, Carl Heinmiller, Marty Cordes, Clarence Mattson, and Steve Homer) who called it &quot;Port Chilkoot&quot;, thus forming the Port Chilkoot Company. Port Chilkoot was incorporated as a city in 1956. In 1970, Port Chilkoot merged with Haines into one municipality. Heinmiller was Port Chilkoot&#x27;s mayor for the majority of its existence as a separate city. In 1972, the fort was designated a National Historic Landmark and the name, Fort William H. Seward, was restored.

Haines was the southern terminal of the Haines-Fairbanks Pipeline (not connected or related to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System), which provided refined petroleum products to Fort Greely, Eielson Air Force Base, and Ladd Air Force Base (transferred to the Army as Fort Wainwright in 1961). The , pipeline carried diesel, automotive gas, jet fuel, and aviation gas from Haines to Fairbanks from 1955 until it was retired by the U.S. Army in 1973, due to deterioration and prohibitive repair costs. An Army facility with storage tanks existed alongside the Haines Terminal, which was maintained by the Army for another decade. The construction and maintenance of the terminal and storage facility were a significant factor in the Haines economy for four decades. All but one of the canneries closed by 1972 due to declining fish stocks leaving Haines Packing Co. as the sole remaining cannery located in Haines. Nonetheless, commercial fishing remained an important part of the local economy.

In October 2002, voters approved a measure consolidating the city of Haines and Haines Borough into a home rule borough.

==Geography and climate==
Haines has a dry-summer humid continental climate with warm summers (Köppen: &quot;Dsb&quot;), although featuring nearly double the precipitation of nearby Skagway.
The Haines CDP is located in the north-central part of Haines Borough at . The CDP is situated on the Chilkat Peninsula at a narrow spot called the Deshu Isthmus. The community is bounded by Portage Cove of Chilkoot Inlet to the east and by the Chilkat River at its mouth into the Chilkat Inlet to the west. To the south, down the Chilkat Peninsula, Haines is bordered by the CDP of Mud Bay, and, to the north, it is bordered by the Lutak CDP. Alaska Route 7, the Haines Highway, terminates at Haines and leads northwest to the Canadian border near Pleasant Camp, British Columbia. The Haines Highway continues north to a junction with the Alaska Highway at Haines Junction, Yukon, from Haines.

==Attractions==

Many tourists visit during when there is an annual appearance of bald eagles in the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve between October and February. Haines has the largest concentration of bald eagles in the world at that time. Each May, Haines holds Alaska&#x27;s longest running beer festival with over 1,500 visitors and breweries from Alaska and Yukon. 

Haines is the host of the Southeast Alaska State Fair, with four days of festivities on the last weekend of July. Vendors, games, rides, and a music festival bring people from all over Alaska for this event. The community and surrounding area are popular for outdoor recreation. Rafting in the Chilkat River and hiking in the Takshanuk Mountains (Mount Ripinsky and other peaks) are both popular. Growing winter recreational opportunities are available at and around Chilkat Pass, for which Haines serves as a gateway with the Haines Highway. In recent years, Haines has continued to receive quite a bit of attention as a heli-skiing site. The Davidson Glacier, due to its relatively accessible nature, is a popular attraction.
Lutak Inlet and Chilkoot Lake are easily accessible and popular fishing sites. Lutak Inlet is frequented by numerous sea lions, seals, and orcas. Fort William H. Seward is a nationally recognized historic site (declared a National Historic Landmark in 1978) where a number of barracks, officer housing, and the parade grounds are maintained in private ownership today. Some of the structures are open to the public as businesses and restaurants. The fort is also referred to as &quot;Port Chilkoot&quot;, a leftover term from the Port Chilkoot Company, which was formed after World War II by a group of investors who purchased the fort from the federal government.

Haines has a number of cultural offerings. Alaska Indian Arts offers demonstrations by traditional craftsmen. History of the town of Haines and the local Tlingit people are featured in the Sheldon Museum &amp; Cultural Center. The Hammer Museum is dedicated to the history of the hammer in human society. The Tsirku Canning Company Museum offers a glimpse of Haines&#x27; historic salmon canneries. The American Bald Eagle Foundation offers visitors a chance to tour the Natural History Museum, full of items from Southeast Alaska, and meet 9 raptor ambassadors. The ambassadors include 3 bald eagles (Bella, Arden, and Vega), 2 red-tailed hawks (Sitka and Warrior), one Eurasian eagle owl (Hans), one Eastern screech owl (Dylan), one Northern hawk owl (Cirrus), and one Peregrin falcon (Ole).

Haines is the location for the Southeast Alaskan State Fair, held annually each July. Among other attractions, the fairgrounds incorporate a portion of the set from Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;White Fang&quot; film, filmed in Haines in 1990. The surviving set includes a dozen small structures common to a mining town of the period of Jack London&#x27;s book of the same name.

==Education==
Haines is home to the Haines Borough Public Library and the Haines Borough School District, which consists of a K-12 and three divisions in a single building:
Haines Elementary (K-6)
Haines Middle/High School (7-12)
The Haines Home School is also in operation. As of October 2018, the district&#x27;s student enrollment was 258.

==Transportation==

Haines is more accessible than most other southeast Alaskan communities of its size, as it is connected to the North American highway system by the Haines Highway, which passes through British Columbia on its way to the junction with the Alaska Highway at Haines Junction, Yukon. However, snow and ice conditions in the winter and the long driving times can often make this route less feasible, and at times results in closure of the portion of the highway in the Chilkat Pass, just north of the Canada–US border. Haines is one of only three cities in southeast Alaska which are inaccessible by road to another city, the other two being Skagway and Hyder. The primary mode of intra-Alaskan transportation is by the Alaska Marine Highway. The Lynn Canal route of the ferry system (Juneau-Haines-Skagway) is the only profitable route in the entire system and often receives a large amount of ferry traffic, especially in the summer.

The Haines Airport receives a large amount of traffic, with one air carrier (Alaska Seaplanes) providing services to Skagway and Juneau. Haines became a port-of-call to several cruise ship operators including Princess Cruises and the Holland-America Line. As of summer 2009, the cruise ship visiting frequency was about 18 per season, according to local residents. Between 2010 and 2012, an average of 30,000 cruise ship passengers visited annually. The cruise ship berth is very near Fort William H. Seward.

==Health care==
Haines is served by Haines Health Center, the only primary health clinic in the area. The facility is part of the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium, or SEARHC, a non-profit tribal health consortium of 18 Native communities. The area is also served continuously by local emergency medical services. Individuals in need of dire medical attention are transported by air via helicopter or air ambulance to Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau (approximately 35 minutes away by plane). Whitehorse General Hospital in Whitehorse, Yukon is the nearest hospital to Haines that is accessible by road (approximately 4.5 hours away).

The difficulties in accessing health care for rural dwellers in general were examined in a short black-and-white documentary set and filmed in and around Haines in 1956, documenting and dramatizing a stop on the travels of a public health nurse and doctor (both female) aboard a travelling clinic boat, &quot;Hygiene&quot;. According to the voiceover narration, the film was cast with local non-actors.

==Media==
Haines is served by a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Chilkat Valley News&quot;, as well as the public radio station KHNS which serves upper Lynn Canal (Haines, Skagway, and Klukwan); its studios are in Haines.

==In popular culture==
At the conclusion of &quot;El Camino&quot;, which is the 2019 epilogue film to the series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, Jesse Pinkman obtains a new identity, escapes Albuquerque, New Mexico and moves to Haines.

<text>Cooper Landing is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska, United States, about south of Anchorage, at the outlet of Kenai Lake into the Kenai River. The town was first settled in the 19th century by gold and mineral prospectors, and has become a popular summer tourist destination thanks to its scenic location and proximity to the salmon fishery of the Kenai River and Russian River. As of the 2010 census, the population in Cooper Landing was 289, down from 369 in 2000.

==History==
Cooper Landing was named for Joseph Cooper, a miner who discovered gold there in 1884. However, Peter Doroshin, a Russian engineer, had identified gold prospects as far back as 1848 when the territory was still part of Russian America.
Cooper Creek was first recorded in 1898 by the U.S. Geological Survey. In 1900, the Census found 21 miners and 1 wife living at Cooper Creek. The Riddiford Post Office began operations in 1924, and the Riddiford School opened in 1928.

In 1938, a road was constructed east to Seward. In 1948, a road west to Kenai was opened, and by 1951, residents could drive north to Anchorage. The Cooper Landing Community Club was first formed in 1949. The Cooper Lake Hydroelectric Facility was constructed in 1959-60.

In 1946, Pat and Helen Gwin arrived in Cooper Landing which had about 100 residents then. The Gwins eked out a living by operating a small packaged goods store out of a tent. That same year, construction began on the highway from Cooper Landing to Homer. The Sterling Highway, the road that is the artery of the Kenai Peninsula, opened in 1950, and subsequently the Seward Highway opened in 1951. Gwin&#x27;s Lodge was built from spruce logs harvested from the surrounding Chugach National Forest. Cutting, hauling and hand-peeling the logs, Pat and Helen Gwin completed and opened the lodge on January 1, 1952. Pat and Helen parted ways in 1959, but Helen stayed to run the lodge and retired in 1976. The historic Gwin&#x27;s Lodge is one of the oldest log roadhouses in Alaska and is still in operation today.

The Cooper Landing Post Office is the oldest building in the area that is still used and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Cooper Landing is located in the north-central part of the Kenai Peninsula at (60.490529, -149.794519). The center of the community is at the west end of Kenai Lake, where the lake flows into the Kenai River. The CDP extends east up Kenai Lake beyond the mouth of Quartz Creek from the north. To the south the CDP reaches Cooper Lake, and Cooper Creek, the lake&#x27;s outlet, forms a portion of the CDP&#x27;s southern border. The CDP reaches west down the Kenai River as far as the mouth of the Russian River, and to the north the CDP extends up the valley of Juneau Creek as far as Trout Lake. Elevations in the CDP range from approximately above sea level at the mouth of the Russian River, to at Kenai Lake, to at the summit of Cecil Rhode Mountain between Kenai Lake and Cooper Creek.
Alaska Route 1, the Sterling Highway, passes through the community, leading north to Anchorage and southwest to Homer. Soldotna, the Kenai Peninsula Borough seat, is to the west on AK-1, and Seward is to the southeast via routes 1 and 9.

<text>Fritz Creek is a census-designated place (CDP) in the Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska, United States, northeast of Homer. At the 2020 census the population was 2,248, up from 1,932 in 2010.

==Fritz Creek Community center and general store==
In 1954, two acres of private land were designated by a local family for a Fritz Creek Civic and Social Center, intended to be an alternative to the rowdy bar scene in nearby Homer. A large stockade-style log building was built to house the center. Community events such as square dances were held in the building for years. The center was damaged by the 1964 Alaska earthquake and required major repairs to the foundation. Over time the building became less of a community center and was largely rented out for events.

In 1982 the property was sold and the building was converted into a general store and gas station, with a post office being added in 1983. Hot food and a small dining area were added later and the store returned to being something of a gathering spot for the surrounding community. Eventually a liqour store was added as well. In 2019, the store was told by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation that Stormy, a cat that had lived in the store for years, was in violation of state law and would need to be removed. Stormy was rehomed with a local resident. The building changed hands several more times before being badly damaged in a fire in July 2023. The cause of the fire is not known.

<text>Homer (Dena&#x27;ina: &quot;Tuggeght&quot;) is a city in Kenai Peninsula Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is southwest of Anchorage. According to the 2020 census, the population is 5,522, up from 5,003 in 2010. Long known as the &quot;Halibut Fishing Capital of the World&quot;, Homer is also nicknamed &quot;the end of the road&quot;, and more recently, &quot;the cosmic hamlet by the sea&quot;.

== Geography ==
Homer is located at 59°38&#x27;35&quot; North, 151°31&#x27;33&quot; West (59.643059, −151.525900). The only road into Homer is the Sterling Highway. The town has a total area of , of which are land and are covered by water.

Homer is on the shore of Kachemak Bay on the southwest side of the Kenai Peninsula. Its distinguishing feature is the Homer Spit, a narrow long gravel bar that extends into the bay, on which is located the Homer Harbor. Much of the coastline, as well as the Homer Spit, sank dramatically during the Good Friday earthquake in March 1964. After the earthquake, very little vegetation was able to survive on the Homer Spit.

=== Climate ===
As with much of South-central Alaska, Homer has a moderate subarctic mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Dsc&quot;), which causes its weather to be moderate compared to interior Alaska. Winters are snowy and long, but not particularly cold, considering the latitude, with the average January high only slightly below freezing. The annual snowfall averages per season, falling primarily from November through March, with some accumulation in October and April but rarely in May. Homer receives only about 25 inches of rainfall annually due to the influence of the Chugach Mountains to the southeast, which shelter it from the Gulf of Alaska. As of 2023, Homer falls within USDA Hardiness Zone 6B. Seven days have a minimum or below annually. The coldest day of the year averaged in the 1991 to 2020 normals, while the warmest night average was at . The coldest daytime maximum on record is on January 28, 1989, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is on August 9, 1971, and August 23, 1963. Summers are cool due to the marine influence, with maxima or minima remaining at or above being extremely rare. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on January 28–29, 1989, up to on July 10, 1993. The coldest has been January 2012 with a mean temperature of , while the warmest month was July 2019 at ; the annual mean temperature has ranged from in 1956 to in 2014.


;Notes: 
== History ==



Tiller digs indicate that early Alutiiq people probably camped in the Homer area, although their villages were on the far side of Kachemak Bay.

Coal was discovered in the area in the 1890s. The Cook Inlet Coal Fields Company built a town, dock, coal mine, and railroad at Homer. Coal mining in the area continued until World War II. It is estimated that 400 million tons of coal deposits are still present in the area.

Homer was named for Homer Pennock, a goldmining company promoter, who arrived in 1896 on the Homer Spit and built living quarters for his crew of 50 men. However, goldmining was never profitable in the area.

Another earlier settlement, Miller&#x27;s Landing, was named after a Charles Miller, who homesteaded in the area around 1915. According to local historian Janet Klein, he was an employee of the Alaska Railroad and had wintered company horses on the beach grasses on the Homer Spit. He built a landing site in a small bight in Kachemak Bay, where supply barges from Seldovia could land and offload their cargos. Miller&#x27;s landing was legally considered a census-designated place separate from Homer until it was annexed in 2002, but has always been locally considered part of Homer.

Halibut and salmon sport fishing, along with tourism and commercial fishing are the dominant industries. Homer co-hosted the 2006 Arctic Winter Games. The Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge and the Kachemak Bay Research Reserve co-host a visitor center with interpretive displays known as the Alaska Islands and Ocean Visitor Center, and a cultural and historical museum there is called the Pratt Museum.

The Homer Public Library has enthusiastic support from the Friends of the Homer Library, established in 1948, which raised funds and support for a new library building, opened on September 16, 2006.

=== Science education ===
Because of the city of Homer&#x27;s location on the Kenai Peninsula and its abundance of natural resources and marine habitats, there are many public education programs focused on the environment. Some of these educational endeavors include the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge Visitor Center (also known as the Alaska Island and Ocean Center) and the &quot;Center for Alaskan Coastal Studies&quot;. Both organizations encourage science education and sponsor many events aimed to teach people of all ages about the ecosystem and conservation. Some of these events include the Kachemak Crane Watch and the &quot;Kachemak Bay Science Conference&quot;, both sponsored by the Center for Alaskan Coastal Studies.

=== Kachemak Bay Shorebird Festival ===
Homer hosts the Kachemak Bay Shorebird festival, which was established in 1993 by a group of Homer residents who wished to educate the public about shorebirds and the wetlands the birds inhabit. Today, the festival is sponsored by Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge and the Friends of Alaska National Wildlife Refuges. The festival is held annually in early May when more than 13,000 shorebirds from 25 different species visit the Kachemak Bay area during spring migration. Tourists and Alaskans alike attend the festival and are encouraged to watch the shorebird migration through a variety of land and boat tours in collaboration with the festival.

Some birds seen during the spring migration and the festival include horned puffins, sandhill cranes, and arctic terns. Arctic Terns are famous for flying the longest distance of any migrating bird. Many of the birds seen during the festival can be identified with the help of published guides that categorize distinguishable features such as, topography, silhouette, size, and color. The festival also includes the Shorebirds Sing: Bird Call Contest, where contestants compete to mimic the calls of various bird species.

In 2020, the festival was held entirely virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic and all presentations, speeches, and events were conducted online. The 2021 festival was held both in person and virtually, with events taking place online and face-to-face.
== Media ==

==History and culture==
The Dena&#x27;ina name for Kalifornsky is &quot;Unhghenesditnu&quot;, meaning &#x27;farthest creek over&#x27;.

The place name &quot;Kalifonsky&quot; (omitting the letter &quot;r&quot;) was noted in 1916 by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, with its etymology attributed to an Indian word &quot;kali&quot; meaning &quot;fishermen&quot;.

However, this place name appears to have been due to a mistaken transcription of the village name &quot;Kalifornsky&quot;, which took its name from the surname of the village&#x27;s founder, a Dena&#x27;ina Indian named Qadanalchen (meaning &quot;acts quickly&quot; in the Outer Inlet dialect of the Dena&#x27;ina language). Qadanalchen had worked at the Russian American colony of Fort Ross in California from about 1812 to about 1821. On his return to Alaska, Qadanalchen took the name &quot;Kalifornsky&quot;, the Russian equivalent of &quot;Californian&quot;.

Qadanalchen&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the self-taught Dena&#x27;ina writer and ethnographer Peter Kalifornsky (1911–1993), was born in Kalifornsky village, which lay about south of Kenai and north of the mouth of the Kasilof River.

<text>Kenai (, ) (Dena&#x27;ina: ; , &quot;Kenay&quot;) is a city in the Kenai Peninsula Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. By road, it is 158 miles southwest of Anchorage. The population was 7,424 as of the 2020 census, up from 7,100 in 2010, the fifteenth-most populated city in the state.

== History ==

The city of Kenai is named after the local Dena&#x27;ina word &#x27;ken&#x27; or &#x27;kena&#x27;, which means &#x27;flat, meadow, open area with few trees; base, low ridge&#x27;, according to the Dena&#x27;ina Topical Dictionary by James Kari, Ph.D., published in 2007. This describes the area along the mouth and portion of the Kenai River near the City of Kenai. Archaeological evidence suggests that the area was first occupied by the Kachemak people from 1000 B.C., until they were displaced by the Dena&#x27;ina Athabaskan people around 1000 A.D. Before the arrival of the Russians, Kenai was a Dena&#x27;ina village called &quot;Shk&#x27;ituk&#x27;t&quot;, meaning &quot;where we slide down.&quot; When Russian fur traders first arrived in 1741, about 1,000 Dena&#x27;ina lived in the village. The traders called the people &quot;Kenaitze&quot;, which is a Russian term for &quot;people of the flats&quot;, or &quot;Kenai people&quot;. This name was later adopted when they were incorporated as the Kenaitze Alaskan Natives in the early 1970s.

=== Fur trade ===
In 1786, Pytor Zaykov built Nikolaevskaia krepost (Fort Nicholas) for the Lebedev-Lastochkin Company on the site of modern Kenai, being the first European settlement on the Alaskan mainland. Hostilities surfaced between the natives and settlers in 1797, culminating in an incident in which the Dena&#x27;ina attacked Fort St. Nicholas, later dubbed the battle of Kenai. Over one hundred deaths occurred from all involved parties. In 1838, the introduction of smallpox killed one half of the Dena&#x27;ina population.

=== United States ===

In 1869, after the Alaska Purchase, the United States Army established a post called Fort Kenay. It was soon abandoned.

In 1895–96, the Holy Assumption of the Virgin Mary Russian Orthodox Church was built in the village. It is still in use today.

The establishment of shipping companies in the early 1900s broadened Kenai into a port city. Canning companies were established and helped fuel the commercial fishing boom that was the primary activity through the 1920s.

In 1940, homesteads were opened in the area. The first dirt road from Anchorage was constructed in 1951; pavement would not arrive until 1956 with the construction of the Kenai Spur Highway.

A military base, Wildwood Army Station (later Wildwood Air Force Station), was established in 1953, and served as a major communications post. Wildwood was conveyed in 1974 to the Kenai Native Association in partial settlement of Alaska Native land claims. The facility was leased and later purchased by the State of Alaska and presently serves as the Wildwood Correctional Complex.

=== Statehood ===
In 1965, offshore oil discoveries in Cook Inlet caused a period of rapid growth. They were a part of a series of oil deposits located during the middle of the 20th century. In 1957, oil was discovered at Swanson River, northeast of Kenai. This was the first major oil discovery in Alaska.

In 1992 and 2011, Kenai was named one of the All-America Cities.

In 2008, the Kenai River was designated as a Category 5, or &quot;impaired,&quot; water body by the State of Alaska in accordance with the federal Clean Water Act. The Kenai River Working Group (KRWG) was formed to address the issue of water pollution. By 2010, the status of the river was changed to a Category 2, or &quot;water that attains its designated uses.&quot;

==Geography==
Kenai is located at (60.558738, −151.229616), on the west side of the Kenai Peninsula near the outlet of the Kenai River to the Cook Inlet of the Pacific Ocean. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (15.85%) is water.

===Climate===
As with much of Southcentral Alaska, Kenai has a moderate dry-summer subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: Dsc) due to the cool summers. Winters are snowy, long but not particularly cold, especially considering the latitude, with January featuring a daily average temperature of . Snow averages per season, falling primarily from October through March, with some accumulation in April, and rarely in May or September. There are 37 nights of sub- lows annually, and the area lies in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 4, indicating an average annual minimum in the −20 to −30 °F (−29 to −34 °C) range. Summers are cool due to the marine influence, with + highs or + lows being extremely rare. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on February 4, 1947, up to on July 4, 2019.

==Demographics==

Kenai first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as the unincorporated &quot;Creole&quot; (mixed Russian and Native people) village of Kenai Rédoute. It was simply shortened to Kenai with the 1890 census. It was officially incorporated in 1960.

As of the census of 2020, there were 7,424 people, 3,143 households, and 1,788 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 3,003 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 74.4% White, 0.8% Black or African American, 12.0% Native American, 2.7% Asian, 1.3% Pacific Islander, and 6.7% from two or more races. 6.5% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 3,143 households, out of which 40.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.5% were married couples living together, 12.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.8% were non-families. 26.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.45 and the average family size was 3.20.

In the city population was spread out, with 32.8% under the age of 18, 7.7% from 18 to 24, 31.3% from 25 to 44, 21.8% from 45 to 64, and 6.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32 years. For every 100 females, there were 97.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.6 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $45,962, and the median income for a family was $61,348. Males had a median income of $48,371 versus $27,112 for females. The per capita income for the city was $20,789. About 8.2% of families and 13.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 12.5% of those under age 18 and 4.2% of those age 65 or over.

==Transportation==
The main road access to Kenai is via the Kenai Spur Highway, which branches off of the Sterling Highway in downtown Soldotna and winds through downtown and the portions of city limits north of the Kenai River. The Warren Ames Memorial Bridge, located within city limits and the Kenai River&#x27;s farthest downriver crossing, provides access to the portions of city limits south of the river and to Kalifornsky Beach Road, the latter providing an alternate access to Soldotna and the outlying road network. Beaver Loop Road provides access to neighborhoods and parklands upriver of the bridge.

Although many fishing boats are based in Kenai, the city does not have a formal port and harbor. There are docks for offloading the catch, but commercial fishing boats are generally moored offshore in the Kenai River. The nearest deep water port is in Nikiski, but is primarily reserved for use by the oil and gas extraction industry. The Kenai Airport has regularly scheduled flights to Anchorage.

==Fishing==

In 1985, a world record largest sport-caught Chinook (or &quot;king&quot;) salmon was taken from the Kenai River, weighing in at 97 lbs 4oz. Eight of the ten largest king salmons caught in the world have come from the same river, making the city a popular fishing tourist location.

The lower reaches of the Kenai River, including its mouth where it empties into Cook Inlet, are within city limits. This area is the site of a designated personal use dipnet fishery during the month of July, one of a number of such fisheries throughout various parts of Alaska, that is open annually to residents of the state. The dipnetting season and fishing limitations are set by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and require fishermen to carry personal use fishing permits and only fish within designated regions and limits. Because the fishery is easily accessible and open to all Alaska residents, participation has grown over time, creating a significant strain on city resources as they deal with litter, fish waste, fire hazards and other issues associated with having in excess of ten thousand extra persons in the city during this period.

<text>Nanwalek (‘place by lagoon’; ), formerly Alexandrovsk () and later English Bay, is a census-designated place (CDP) in the Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska, United States, that contains a traditional Alutiiq village. The population was 247 at the 2020 United States census, down from 254 in 2010. There is one school located in the community, attended by 81 students.

Subsistence activities are a large part of the culture for indigenous people, and Nanwalek is no exception, especially when it comes to salmon and seal harvesting. The sale of alcohol is banned in the village, although importing and possession are allowed.

==Geography==
Nanwalek and Port Graham are located near the southern tip of the Kenai Peninsula and are separated by less than . Both villages are accessible only by air or water (they lie southwest of Homer). The Alaska Marine Highway System provides service to nearby Seldovia (located only up the coast line). A state-owned gravel airstrip sits atop a natural spit which divides the small lagoon from the southern mouth of Cook Inlet. Looking northwest across Cook Inlet, one can see Mount Iliamna away and further to the north Mount Redoubt, away. Although they are in the vicinity of the village, they do not cause trouble to the villagers, since Iliamna is erupting continuously, emitting only smoke, and Redoubt is so far in the north that the ashes from its eruptions bother mostly Kenai and Anchorage. It is Augustine (the most active volcano of the eastern Aleutian arc), due west across Cook Inlet, which makes life nasty in Nanwalek, Port Graham, Seldovia and Homer when it erupts, as it most recently has done in 1986 and 2006.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.16%, are water.

==Early history==
A Russian fortress called Aleksandrovsk, the first Russian post on mainland Alaska, was established at the present site of Nanwalek by men of Grigorii Shelikhov’s company in 1786, while Shelikhov himself was still on Kodiak Island.

In 1793, men from the company of the rivalling Pavel Lebedev-Lastochkin, who had in the meantime established themselves around the modern city of Kenai, attacked with 60 men the Aleksandrovsk fortress, accompanied by Dena&#x27;ina warriors. Lebedev-Lastochkin’s men organized various provocations and beat the local Natives, took from them furs that would have been sent to Shelikhov’s men in Kodiak, but ultimately they could not capture the fort.

In the summer of 1794, the fortress was moved to a new, higher place, since the old structures had rotted and had begun to collapse as a result of high tides. At this time, the head of the fortress was V. I. Malakhov. This seems to indicate that the first fortress had been located on the Nanwalek spit.

In 1798, when the Dena&#x27;ina Indians rose against the men of Lebedev-Lastochkin’s company in Kenai, Tyonek and Old Iliamna, the timely arrival of a detachment from Aleksandrovsk, led by V. I. Malakhov, saved the Kenai colony from total destruction. The Tyonek and Iliamna colonies, however, were destroyed.

By 1818, the fortress in Nanwalek was closed down, and possibly the colony since then existed as an odinochka, or ‘one man post’, although this is not certain. The fortress was transferred at this time to Nushagak, where it was known as the Novo-Aleksandrovskii fortress (‘New Aleksandrovskii fortress’).

==Demographics==
Many of the current residents are of mixed Russian and Sugpiaq (Alutiiq) heritage. Villagers speak Sugt&#x27;stun, an Eskimo language closely related to Yup&#x27;ik.
Nanwalek first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as the unincorporated village of Alexandrovsk. It had 75 Sugpiaq residents, 12 Creole (Mixed Russian &amp; Sugpiaq) and 1 White. It reported as English Bay in 1890, with 107 residents (100 Sugpiaq, 6 Creole, 1 White). It did not report again until 1930, when it returned 107 residents, the same as 40 years earlier. It continued to report in every successive census. In 1980, English Bay was made a census-designated place (CDP). In 1991, the name was officially changed to the present Nanwalek.

As of the census of 2000, there were 177 people, 45 households, and 32 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 54 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 6.78% White, 89.27% Native American, and 3.95% from two or more races. 1.13% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 45 households, out of which 55.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 51.1% were married couples living together, 15.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.7% were non-families. 22.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 2.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.93 and the average family size was 4.79.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 42.9% under the age of 18, 14.1% from 18 to 24, 31.6% from 25 to 44, 10.7% from 45 to 64, and 0.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females, there were 113.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 114.9 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $42,500, and the median income for a family was $45,750. Males had a median income of $33,750 versus $32,813 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $10,577. About 14.7% of families and 17.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 12.6% of those under the age of 18 and none of those 65 or over.

== Religion ==
A Russian Orthodox church consecrated to Saints Sergius and Herman of Valaam was built in the community in 1870 (only three years after the sale of Alaska by Russia to the United States). A replacement church building was constructed in 1930 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Orthodox Church in Alaska can trace its activities back to early Russian missionaries. The witness of Herman of Alaska, Saint Innocent of Alaska, and Peter the Aleut has contributed to the continuing strong Orthodox community in villages like Nanwalek.

== Transportation ==

Nanwalek has a public-use airport, the Nanwalek Airport.

Kultuk had a population of 17, and Titukilsk and Nikishka had a population of 57, all of whom were Tinneh Natives. There apparently were no census reports from 1880 until 1980, when the area was organized as &quot;Nikishka&quot; and made a census-designated place (CDP). The name was altered to &quot;Nikiski&quot; in 1990 and has reported as such on each successive census.

As of the census of 2000, there were 4,327 people, 1,514 households, and 1,130 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 1,766 housing units at an average density of .

There were 1,514 households, out of which 41.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.9% were married couples living together, 7.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 25.3% were non-families. 20.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 3.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.86 and the average family size was 3.31.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 33.5% under the age of 18, 6.3% from 18 to 24, 29.8% from 25 to 44, 24.5% from 45 to 64, and 5.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 109.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 111.3 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $51,176, and the median income for a family was $55,969. Males had a median income of $50,673 versus $26,779 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $20,128. About 9.3% of families and 11.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.0% of those under age 18 and 7.5% of those age 65 or over.

==History==
Nikiski was once home to an Agrium fertilizer plant, which was once the Kenai Peninsula Borough&#x27;s largest employer. The facility closed in 2008 due to natural gas shortages, but the company continues to explore reopening it.

<text>Nikolaevsk () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kenai Peninsula Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. As of the 2020 census, the population of the CDP is 328, up from 318 in 2010. Nikolaevsk School serves school-age children from the area.

==History==
The town was settled by a group of Old Believers from Oregon around 1968, and remains a largely ethnic Russian town to this day. The travels of the group from Russia, as well as the story of the founding of Nikolaevsk, is told in a 1972 article in &quot;National Geographic&quot;, a 2013 episode on the NatGeo channel called &quot;Russian Alaska&quot;, and a 2013 article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine.

The first church was built in 1983. The second church was constructed in 2014.

In May 2023, it became known that the Old Believers community of Nikolaevsk, Alaska, consisting of fr. Nikola Yakunin, his son Deacon Vasily Yakunin and about 20 families decided to join the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (semi-autonomous part of Moscow Patriarchate) on the rights of the edinoverie. It was reported that the community was largely Americanized and it turned out to be problematic to pray in the already almost forgotten Church Slavonic language. They planned to build a new church for the community in Homer, near Nikolaevsk, because the old church will remain under the jurisdiction of the Lipovan Orthodox Old-Rite Church according to U.S. law.

==Geography==
Nikolaevsk is on the west side of the Kenai Peninsula at (59.813043, -151.668387). It is bordered to the south and west by the Anchor Point CDP and to the north by the Happy Valley CDP. Road access is via the North Fork Road, which junctions with the Sterling Highway to the west in Anchor Point.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it recorded as land. The North Fork of the Anchor River forms the southern border of the community, and the Chakok River forms the western border.

Nikolaevsk is in the boreal wet forest biome, according to the Holdridge life zones system.

==Climate==
Nikolaevsk features a subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;) with short, quite mild summers and long, cold winters. Nikolaevsk experiences a significant marine influence.

Homer 8 NW is a weather station near Nikolaevsk, at an elevation of 1080 ft (329 m).

<text>Ninilchik (Dena&#x27;ina: &quot;Niqnalchint&quot;, , Alaskan Russian: &quot;N&#x27;in&#x27;íl&#x27;chik&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 883, up from 772 in 2000.

It is considered an Alaska Native village under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. In the 1970s, villagers formed the Ninilchik Native Association Incorporated. Later the Ninilchik Traditional Council (NTC) was established as the government of Alaska Natives in this area.

The Alaska Native people of Ninilchik have ancestors of Aleut and Alutiiq (Sugpiaq) descent, as well as some Dena&#x27;ina. Many also include Russian ancestors, from a couple of men who settled here with their Alutiiq wives and children in 1847, and later migrants. Alaskan Russian was widely spoken in the village for almost 200 years. Due to the community&#x27;s isolation, this Russian dialect continued much in its mid-19th century form. In the 21st century, the dialect has been studied and preserved from local speakers.

==Geography==
Ninilchik is on the west side of the Kenai Peninsula on the coast of Cook Inlet, by air southwest of Kenai, and southwest of Anchorage. Road access is by the Sterling Highway. By actual road miles it is a distance of from Anchorage and from Homer.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.01%, are water.

===Climate===
Ninilchik has a continental subarctic climate (Köppen Dsc).
==Demographics==
In Russian Alaska, Creole &quot;promyshlenniki&quot; intermarried with and Aleuts and Alutiiqs gave rise to a small but influential population of Alaskan Creoles. Ninilchik first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as an unincorporated Creole village. All 53 of its residents were Creole. It returned in 1890 with 81 residents, however the census combined the adjacent locales of the Laida native village and Anchor Point mine along with Treadwell coal mine (not to be confused with the Treadwell that is now within Juneau). There were 53 Creole residents (probably all Ninilchik residents), 16 Natives (probably the Tinneh residents of Laida), and 12 Whites (probably the residents of the two mining locales). Ninilchik did not return again until 1920, when it was spelled as &quot;Ninilchic&quot; on the census. It returned as Ninilchik again in 1930, and in every successive census to date. It was made a census-designated place (CDP) in 1980.

As of the census of 2000, there were 772 people, 320 households, and 223 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 762 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 82.25% White, 13.99% Native American, 0.52% Asian, 0.13% from other races, and 3.11% from two or more races. 0.65% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 320 households, out of which 29.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.4% were married couples living together, 6.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.3% were non-families. 23.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.41 and the average family size was 2.87.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 24.1% under the age of 18, 5.4% from 18 to 24, 26.3% from 25 to 44, 29.5% from 45 to 64, and 14.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42 years. For every 100 females, there were 110.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 114.7 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $36,250, and the median income for a family was $41,750. Males had a median income of $29,861 versus $22,750 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $18,463. About 10.4% of families and 13.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.2% of those under age 18 and 7.2% of those age 65 or over.

==History==

Before the arrival of Europeans in Alaska, Ninilchik was a Dena&#x27;ina Athabaskan lodging area used for hunting and fishing. The name &quot;Ninilchik&quot; probably derives from &quot;Niqnilchint&quot;, a Deni&#x27;ana Athabaskan word meaning &quot;lodge is built place&quot;.

The first Europeans who permanently settled in the village were Russian colonists who moved there from Kodiak Island in 1847, two decades before the Alaska Purchase in 1867 by the United States. They were Russian Grigorii Kvasnikov (anglicized to Kvasnikoff), his Russian-Alutiiq wife Mavra Rastorguev (daughter of Agrafena Petrovna of Afognak), and their children. They were soon joined by the Oskolkoff family, also headed by a Russian man and Alutiiq woman. These were the core families, and their descendants, who often married Alutiiq, made up most of the village.

Their dialect of Russian as spoken in the mid-1800s (plus a few words borrowed from Alaska Native languages) became the primary language spoken in Ninilchik, and it survived in that form long past the 1867 Alaska Purchase. A few speakers of the Ninilchik Russian dialect were still alive in 2013. Russian and American linguists are documenting and cataloging this isolated dialect.

The 1880 United States Census listed 53 &quot;Creoles&quot; living in Ninilchik in nine extended families. All nine old families of Ninilchik are descendants of the original Kvasnikoff and Oskolkoff families, with numerous marriages to Alaska Natives, primarily Alutiiq.

In 1896, a school was built and staffed by Russian Orthodox priests and laymen. Russian Orthodox priests were respected by Alaska Natives because in several areas of southwest Alaska, they had learned indigenous languages and held religious services in those languages. In 1901, the local Russian Orthodox Church was redesigned and constructed at its current site. In 1911 the first school sanctioned by the U.S. government was started, known as the Ninilchik School. In 2011 the community celebrated the 100th anniversary of the school.

In the 1940s, a number of American homesteaders began to live in the area. In 1949, Berman Packing Company began fish canning operations at Ninilchik. In 1950, the Sterling Highway was completed through the town.

===Caribou Hills fire===

A 2007 fire that burned near Ninilchik, known as the Caribou Hills fire, moved toward the town. At its peak threatened approximately 300 structures. It eventually burned nearly and destroyed 197 structures.

==Alaska Native people==

The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act recognized Ninilchik as an Alaska Native village. Under this law, villagers formed the Ninilchik Native Association Incorporated. The US Congress recognized that the people of Ninilchik comprised a quasi-sovereign government (equivalent to American Indian tribes). The Ninilchik Traditional Council (NTC) was authorized as the governing body for Natives who live in the area surrounding Ninilchik or who descended from the original inhabitants.

==Community==

The original village is located at the mouth of the Ninilchik River. A small harbor has been constructed near the mouth of the river. The name &quot;Ninilchik&quot; is used today, however, to refer to the original village as well as the community that has grown up around it, extending several miles north, east, and south. Residents of Ninilchik sometimes refer to the original village as Ninilchik Village or simply &quot;the village&quot;.

Ninilchik as a town is not incorporated, but it is under the jurisdiction of the Kenai Peninsula Borough (KPB) and the State of Alaska. Volunteer groups, the NTC, the State of Alaska, and the KPB carry out most of the governmental functions in the area. These include fire-fighting (volunteer), highway snow-removal (state), health services (NTC), and primary and secondary schooling (KPB). A Russian Orthodox church, the Holy Transfiguration of Our Lord Chapel, is located in the community.

==Tourism==
Ninilchik is a popular tourist attraction. Other attractions in the area are salmon fishing, typically now either with commercial guides or private commercial family operations, either along the beach north of Ninilchik River or in Cook Inlet whose waters touch the beach next to the village. Halibut can also be caught in Cook Inlet close to Ninilchik. Pacific razor clams are popular for digging on the beaches near Ninilchik, when the tides are low enough. Clammers should check regulations before digging, as this clam fishery has been closed until further notice. Panoramic views of four Cook Inlet volcanos, historical Old Village, the iconic Russian Orthodox church, Ninilchik River and Deep Creek watersheds, abundant wildlife, and bluff-lined beaches provide photogenic opportunities rich in diversity and depth.

Ninilchik is the host community for the annual Kenai Peninsula Fair and the annual Salmonfest Alaska (formerly Salmonstock) Music Festival. Ninilchik Chamber of Commerce sponsors the annual Clam Scramble, a river to river obstacle run held during or close to the solstice.

==Parks==
There are two Alaska State Parks units in the Ninilchik area. Just north of town at mile 135 of the Sterling Highway is the Ninilchik State Recreation Area, which features two campgrounds, beach and river access, and scenic overlooks of Cook Inlet.

Just to the south of Ninilchik is the Deep Creek State Recreation Area which has a large campground on the beach, several parking areas for access to fishing in Deep Creek, and tractor-assisted boat launching. Both areas are known for the near-constant presence of bald eagles.

<text>Seldovia (Alutiiq: ; Dena&#x27;ina: &quot;Angidahtnu&quot;; ) is a city in Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska, United States. Its population was 255 at the 2010 census, down from 286 in 2000. It is located along Kachemak Bay southwest of Homer. There is no road system connecting the town to other communities, so all travel to Seldovia is by airplane or boat.

The Alaska Native people of Seldovia make up approximately one quarter of the population and have ancestors of Aleut and Alutiiq (Sugpiaq) descent, as well as some Dena&#x27;ina.

==History==

The native residents are mixed Dena&#x27;ina Athabaskan Indian and Alutiiq (Sugpiaq) Eskimo. In 1787 or 1788 a Russian fur trade post named Aleksandrovskaia was established at today&#x27;s Seldovia by hunting parties under Evstratii Ivanovich Delarov, of the Shelikhov-Golikov company, precursor of the Russian-American Company.
Although there has been little definitive archeological evidence of human habitation at Seldovia prior to the 1800s, it is said the early Russian St. Nicholas Orthodox Church, started in 1820, was built on top of an older aboriginal Inuit village site. The town&#x27;s original Russian name, Seldevoy, translates to &quot;Herring Bay&quot;, as there was a significant herring population prior to rampant overfishing early in the 20th century.
Until the development of a more complete road system in Alaska, Seldovia was an important &quot;first stop&quot; for ships sailing from Seward, Kodiak and other points outside Cook Inlet. At one time Seldovia was home to over 2,000 residents, but today fewer than 300 persons reside year round.

The town was one of many communities along the shores of Cook Inlet, noted for having one of the most severe tidal movements in North America. Similar to the dramatic tides of Bay of Fundy, the Cook Inlet&#x27;s waters prior to 1964 would rise or fall 26 feet every six hours during the peak tides.

After the Good Friday earthquake on March 27, 1964, which registered 9.2 on the moment magnitude scale, the surrounding land mass dropped six feet. Seldovia&#x27;s &quot;boardwalk&quot; before the earthquake was thick wooden plank and piling, and the town&#x27;s main street was built almost entirely along the waterfront. Most of the community&#x27;s businesses, and many homes were similarly constructed upon pilings on either side of this &quot;street&quot;. The sudden sinking of the land caused higher tides, peaking at 32 feet, to completely submerge the boardwalk and flood the homes and businesses along the waterfront.

The waterfront was rebuilt (known at the time as &quot;urban renewal&quot;) using fill from Cap&#x27;s Hill, which was demolished to rebuild the town on higher ground. There is only one small portion of the boardwalk left; this section of the boardwalk was built decades after the original boardwalk and it is known to the townfolk as &quot;the new boardwalk&quot;, even though it is now the only boardwalk. The original boardwalk is completely gone, destroyed during the urban renewal process, along with many homes and businesses.

Seldovia has been home to many industries, including fox farming, berry picking and commercial fishing, including King Crab fishing. Logging and mining have also featured in local history. Today charter boats keep busy bringing the visiting sport fishermen to the fishing grounds of Kachemak Bay and other nearby waters.

<text>Seward (Alutiiq: ; Dena&#x27;ina: &quot;Tl&#x27;ubugh&quot;) is an incorporated home rule city in Alaska, United States. Located on Resurrection Bay, a fjord of the Gulf of Alaska on the Kenai Peninsula, Seward is situated on Alaska&#x27;s southern coast, approximately by road from Alaska&#x27;s largest city, Anchorage.

With a population of 2,717 people as of the 2020 census,
 Seward is the fourth-largest city in the Kenai Peninsula Borough, behind Kenai, Homer, and the borough seat of Soldotna. The city is named for former United States Secretary of State William H. Seward, who orchestrated the United States&#x27; purchase of Alaska from the Russian Empire in 1867 while serving in this position as part of President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s administration.

Seward is the southern terminus of the Alaska Railroad and the historic starting point of the original Iditarod Trail to Interior Alaska, with Mile 0 of the trail marked on the shoreline at the southern end of town.

==History==


In 1793, Alexander Baranov of the Shelikhov-Golikov company (precursor of the Russian-American Company) established a fur trade post on Resurrection Bay where Seward is today and had a three-masted vessel, the &quot;Phoenix&quot;, built at the post by James Shields, an English shipwright in Russian service.

The 1939 Slattery Report on Alaskan development identified the region as one of the areas where new settlements would be established through Jewish immigration. This plan was never implemented.
Seward was an important port for the military buildup in Alaska during World War II. Fort Raymond was established in Seward along the Resurrection River to protect the community. An Army airfield built in Seward during the war later became Walseth Air Force Base. Both of the military facilities were closed shortly after the end of the war.

A large portion of Seward was damaged by shaking and a local tsunami during the 1964 Alaska earthquake, destroying all evidence of one radio station.

The Jessie Lee home, on Jessie Lee road, was demolished years ago.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (32.93%) is water.

The northern city limits are demarcated by the lower reaches of the Resurrection River, but extend east past the river&#x27;s mouth at the northern end of Resurrection Bay to include parts of the bay&#x27;s extreme northeastern shore, including the beach at the mouth of Fourth of July Creek and the grounds of Spring Creek Correctional Center just inland. To the south, the city limits extend to the unincorporated community of Lowell Point, while the east and west sides of the city are constrained by Resurrection Bay and the steep slopes of Mount Marathon.

Nearby settlements include the aforementioned Lowell Point to the south, as well as the census-designated places of Bear Creek and Moose Pass further north. The nearest incorporated city is Soldotna, about 90 miles (by road) to the northwest.

===Climate===
Depending on the isotherm, Seward has a subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfc&quot;) or a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;), but it experiences relatively moderate temperatures compared to the rest of the state throughout the year due to the influence of the nearby Gulf of Alaska. Only one month, January, sees an average daily high temperature below freezing, and temperatures below zero degrees Fahrenheit are rare. The oceanic influence also imparts a high level of precipitation, with the heaviest amounts occurring during the fall and winter months.

==Economy==
Seward&#x27;s local economy is largely driven by the commercial fishing industry and seasonal tourism. Many lodging facilities, restaurants and shops in the city cater mainly to tourists, and are only open for business during the summer tourist season, generally regarded as running from mid-May through mid-September. Other major employers in the city include the state-run Spring Creek Correctional Center, the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development&#x27;s AVTEC vocational school, and the local Providence Health &amp; Services branch, which also serves as the community&#x27;s main medical center.

=== Fishing ===
Seward is the site of an annual salmon run which, in the 1920s, came to &quot;countless millions&quot; and supported a community of fisherman of mainly Scandinavian origin. It was then the headquarters of the halibut fleet.

Seward is among the most lucrative commercial fisheries ports in the United States, according to reports from the National Marine Fisheries Service. Per the most recent yearly data available, for 2016, commercial fishing boats in Seward offloaded approximately 13,500 tons of fish and shellfish, valued at about $42 million. Over the course of the decade from 2007 to 2016, around $545 million in commercial seafood passed through Seward&#x27;s harbor.

=== Tourism ===
Owing to its position at the southern terminus of the Alaska Railroad and well-developed road links to Anchorage and the rest of the Kenai Peninsula, Seward is both a major northern end-port for several major cruise ship lines that host Alaskan cruises, such as Norwegian, Royal Caribbean, Holland America, and Celebrity Cruises, and a common destination for general Alaskan tourism.

Seward also has a minor military installation and is the home port of the USCGC &quot;Mustang&quot;.

==Demographics==

Seward first appeared on the 1910 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It formally incorporated in 1912.

As of the census of 2000, there were 2,830 people, 917 households, and 555 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 1,058 housing units at an average density of .

The average household size was 2.40 and the average family size was 3.04.

In the city, the age distribution of the population shows 21.9% under the age of 18, 9.0% from 18 to 24, 35.9% from 25 to 44, 25.7% from 45 to 64, and 7.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 150.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 166.6 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $44,306, and the median income for a family was $54,904. Males had a median income of $36,900 versus $30,508 for females. The per capita income for the city was $20,360. About 8.3% of families and 10.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 12.7% of those under age 18 and 7.9% of those age 65 or over.

==Government and infrastructure==
The City of Seward employs a council–manager style of government, with a seven-member city council elected by the citizens, as well as a council-appointed city manager, city attorney and city clerk, responsible for all local administration including police, fire, utilities, and harbor management. At the borough level, Seward is situated in Kenai Peninsula Borough District 6, which has one seat on the nine-member borough council. This council oversees area-wide issues such as education, waste management, zoning and taxation assessment.The United States Postal Service maintains a post office in Seward with zip code 99664.

In the Alaska House of Representatives, the city is in the 29th District, represented by Republican Ben Carpenter.

In the Alaska Senate, the city is in District O, represented by Republican Peter Micciche.

==Education==
The Kenai Peninsula Borough School District operates schools in Seward, including Seward Elementary School, Seward Middle School, and Seward High School.

==Transportation==
Seward is unusual among most small Alaskan communities in that it has road access in the Seward Highway from Seward to Anchorage, a National Scenic Byway and All-American Road, which also brings it bus service. Seward is also the southern terminus of the Alaska Railroad with the railroad serving the Port of Seward which is capable of accommodating ocean going vessels. This keeps the port busy with freight coming on and off the trains, but also makes Seward a primary end point for north-bound cruise ships. Cruise ship passengers disembark and often take the train or bus farther north to Anchorage, Denali, or other Alaskan attractions. The Alaska Railroad operates passenger service into Seward on a seasonal basis via the 
&quot;Coastal Classic&quot; train. In 2023, there were 87 cruise ship visits to Seward, bringing nearly 200,000 tourists to the town.

The Alaska Railroad Corporation is planning to build a new cruise ship dock and terminal in Seward. The company signed a 30 year contract in 2024 with cruise ship line 
Royal Caribbean International, which will provide the revenue necessary to pay off the bonds that will finance the $137 million project. The terminal building will be 60,000 square feet and the floating dock will be 748 feet long and able to accommodate all cruise ships that visit Alaska. Construction is expected to begin in autumn 2025, and the facility is expected to open in 2026.

Seward is a very bike friendly community. A paved bike path runs from the downtown business district along the waterfront, through the harbor and along the highway to mile 4.5. Bikes are available for rent and there are guided bike tours of the area.

Alaska Marine Highway (ferry) service was discontinued at the end of the 2005. State ferry connections are now available in Whittier (90 miles North) or Homer (150 miles by highway).

Seward Airport (PAWD/SWD) is home to general aviation services and flight-seeing operators. Scheduled commercial service is available at Kenai Municipal Airport in Kenai and Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, both about away. Bus connections are also available.

<doc id="105492" wikidata="Q79393" url="?curid=105492" title="Soldotna, Alaska">
<text>Soldotna is a city in the Kenai Peninsula Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. At the 2020 census, the population was 4,342, up from 4,163 in 2010. It is the seat of the Kenai Peninsula Borough.

Soldotna is located in the Southcentral portion of Alaska on the central-western portion of the Kenai Peninsula. The city limits span 7 square miles along the Kenai River, which empties into the Cook Inlet in the nearby city of Kenai. Soldotna is located on the western edge of the vast Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, a protected area spanning nearly 2 million acres and home to bears, moose, caribou, sheep, and many fish and bird species.

The city is located at the junction of the Sterling Highway and the Kenai Spur Highway, which has enabled Soldotna to develop as a service and retail hub for the Central Peninsula as well as for travelers between Anchorage and Homer. The Central Peninsula Hospital serves the medical needs of the region&#x27;s residents and tourists. The Kenai Peninsula College, a branch of the University of Alaska Anchorage, operates the Kenai River Campus in Soldotna. Additionally, the headquarters of the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, the Kenai Peninsula Borough, and the Kenai Peninsula Borough School District are located in the city.

==History==

In 1947, after World War II, the United States government withdrew a number of townships along Cook Inlet and the lower Kenai River from the Kenai National Moose Range, opening up the area to settlement under the Homestead Act. Veterans of the United States armed services were given a 90-day preference over non-veterans in selecting land and filing for property. Also in that year, the Sterling Highway right-of-way was cleared of trees from Cooper Landing to Kenai. The location of present-day Soldotna was selected as the site for the highway&#x27;s bridge crossing the Kenai River.

The construction of the Sterling Highway provided a link from the Soldotna area to the outside world. More homesteads were taken and visitors came to fish in the area. The Soldotna Post Office opened in 1949 and other businesses opened in the next few years.

Oil was discovered in the Swanson River region in 1957, bringing new economic development to the area. In 1960, Soldotna was incorporated as a fourth class city with a population of 332 and an area of . Then seven years later, in 1967, Soldotna was recognized as a first class city.

In 1964, the Kenai Peninsula College, the Kenai Peninsula Borough government, and the Kenai Peninsula Borough School District were formed.

The city experienced rapid population growth in the 1960s through the 1990s as a result of its location at the intersection of two major highways and due to development of the oil industry on the Kenai Peninsula. As the city and the oil industry have matured, population growth has somewhat slowed, although the city experienced more growth from 2000 to 2010 than during the previous decade. In 2016, it was granted home rule.

The Kenai Watershed Forum (KWF) is a non-profit organization located in the historic Ralph Soberg House inside Soldotna Creek Park. The KWF works to maintain the health of the watersheds on the Kenai Peninsula. Its programs include Stream Watch, which trains volunteers to protect the Russian and Kenai Rivers; a summer camp for 6-12 year olds; and environmental restoration projects ranging from invasive plant remediation to riverbed reconstruction to culvert reconfiguration/replacement.

The Kenai National Wildlife Refuge consists of 1.92 million acres in a variety of ecosystems including ice fields and glaciers, mountain tundra, northern boreal forests, and lakes, wetlands and rivers. The Chickaloon River Flats remains the last pristine major saltwater estuary on the Kenai Peninsula and attracts thousands of migratory waterfowl and shorebirds annually. The Refuge is also home to brown and black bears, dall sheep, moose, and caribou. The Kenai National Wildlife Refuge Visitor&#x27;s Center is located on Ski Hill Road close to the intersection of Funny River Road and the Sterling Highway.

==Transportation==

The Sterling Highway runs through and connects the eastern and central portions of the city. Its intersection with the start of the Kenai Spur Highway, widely known as the &quot;Soldotna Y&quot; due to its previous Y-shaped configuration, is a local landmark. The Kenai Spur Highway connects neighborhoods in the north-central portion of the city to other parts of Soldotna, adjoining Ridgeway and beyond to Kenai, Salamatof and Nikiski, ending along Cook Inlet at the Captain Cook State Recreation Area.

The western portions of Soldotna are connected by local roads (east of the Kenai River) and Kalifornsky Beach Road (west of the river). &quot;K-Beach&quot; Road, as it is often known, is a loop to the west of the Sterling Highway. At its northern end, it straddles the southernmost portions of city limits (including Kenai Peninsula College and the Soldotna Sports Center) and adjoining Kalifornsky. Continuing past city limits, K-Beach provides an alternate access to Kenai along the south side of the Kenai River via the Warren Ames Memorial Bridge, the last road crossing downriver, then continues west and south, returning to the Sterling Highway at Kasilof. Funny River Road continues eastbound from the northern terminus of K-Beach Road, connecting the Sterling Highway with Soldotna Airport (see below), Kenai National Wildlife Refuge headquarters and Funny River.

Almost all of the city&#x27;s commercial districts are arrayed along these roads. Interior arterial and collector streets, such as Binkley and Kobuk streets and Marydale and Redoubt avenues, primarily provide access either to residential areas or to community facilities such as the borough building, the post office, Central Peninsula Hospital and Soldotna High School

===Air===
Soldotna Airport (FAA LID and IATA: SXQ, ICAO: PASX) is a city-owned, public use airport located in the southeastern corner of city limits, across the Kenai River from the city center. Primary access to the airport is from Funny River Road, a short distance east of its intersection with the Sterling Highway.

Two plane crashes associated with operations at the airport, one on February 4, 1985, involving a commuter flight from Anchorage and one on July 7, 2013, involving an air taxi flight, resulted in the deaths of all on-board (nine and ten fatalities, respectively).

===Public transit===
Public transit is offered through CARTS (Central Area Rural Transit System), an on-demand shuttle system serving the communities of Kenai, Soldotna, Funny River, Kasilof, Nikiski, and Sterling. CARTS does not operate like a conventional &quot;city bus&quot;. there are no fixed routes, bus stops, or flagstops. Riders must arrange pickup by phone the day before.

==Recreation and sports==

The City of Soldotna operates eleven recreational parks and a memorial park:
* Swiftwater Park contains campsites, river access, a boat launch, RV dumps, access to wood and ice, and restrooms.
* Centennial Park contains campsites, river access, a boat launch, RV dumps, access to wood and ice, and restrooms.
* Rotary Park contains river access.
* Soldotna Creek Park contains river access, an amphitheater, a community playground, picnic pavilions, restrooms, and open green spaces. The Kenai Watershed Forum is also located in the park at the historic Ralph Soberg House.
* Farnsworth Park contains a playground, picnic pavilions, restrooms, and open green spaces.
* Aspen Park, Pioneer Park, Parker Park, Riverview Park, and Sunrise Park are neighborhood parks.
* Karen Street Park contains skating and BMX infrastructure.
* Memorial Park is the city cemetery and columbarium. 
Additionally, the city owns Arc Lake, located on the Sterling Highway just south of the city limits.

Tsalteshi Trails are located just south of Soldotna with two trailheads; behind Skyview Middle School and across from the Soldotna Sports Center on Kalifornsky Beach Road. The trail system contains over of trails groomed for cross country skiing in the winter and open for hikers, runners, mountain bikers and leashed dogs when there is no snow.

The Soldotna Regional Sports Complex is home to the Kenai River Brown Bears, a Tier II junior hockey team that plays in the North American Hockey League.

Les Anderson, at the time the owner of Soldotna&#x27;s Ford dealership, holds the record for the largest king salmon, caught here on May 17, 1985, and weighing in at 97 lb 4 oz. The record-setting fish is on display at the Soldotna Visitor Center.

Fish counts are determined by sonar fish counters. They are rough estimates based on averages over a prolonged period. For 2012, king salmon were estimated at 5,173, while red salmon were estimated at 1,581,555.

==Economy==

===Government and communities===

In addition to the city government offices, Soldotna is home to the Kenai Peninsula Borough administration and the Kenai Peninsula Borough School District administration. The Donald E. Gilman River Center is a multi-agency permitting, information and education center on Funny River Road near the Soldotna municipal airport. The Center houses staff from the Alaska State Parks agency, the Kenai Peninsula Borough (including the habitat protection, floodplain management, and coastal district programs), the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and the Kenai Watershed Forum.

Electricity is supplied by the consumer-owned Soldotna Generation Plant, operating a 40 MW General Electric LM6000 natural gas turbine. The local grid is islanded after the 2019 Swan Lake Fire. A 46 MW two-hour grid battery started grid stability and peak power in January 2022.

===Healthcare===
The Central Peninsula Hospital is the largest medical facility on the peninsula with 49 beds, an emergency care facility, and specialties including family medicine, ear-nose-throat, birthing center, general surgery, neurology, OB/GYN, oncology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, pathology, pediatrics, podiatry, psychiatry and radiology.

Many smaller healthcare providers and healthcare-related businesses have located in Soldotna to take advantage of proximity to the Central Peninsula hospital.

===Tourism===
Tourism on the Kenai Peninsula revolves heavily around outdoor activities, including fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, and canoeing/rafting. Soldotna provides several city-owned, public access parks along the Kenai River. The river contains all five Pacific salmon species, as well as other salmonids such as Dolly Varden and rainbow trout. Soldotna is also in close proximity to the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, Tsalteshi Trails, and various waterways (the Kenai and Kasilof Rivers, Soldotna and Slikok Creeks, and Skilak and Tustumena Lakes). The Kenai River was selected by CNN Travel as one of the &quot;World&#x27;s 15 Best Rivers for Travelers,&quot; due to its fishing and hunting opportunities.

<text>Sunrise is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska, United States. The population was 18 at the 2010 census, unchanged from 2000.

==Geography==
Sunrise is located on the northern side of the Kenai Peninsula at (60.885663, -149.424556), on the south shore of Turnagain Arm, a branch of Cook Inlet. It is bordered to the west by the community of Hope. To the south the Hope Highway leads to Alaska Route 1, the Sterling Highway.

It was briefly the largest city in the Alaska Territory. At its height in 1898, the community had a summertime population of 800, with several general stores, saloons, and a restaurant and hotel. The city declined after 1900, with miners drawn to richer gold fields elsewhere in Alaska. Many of its buildings burned in the following years, and the last store closed in 1939. Remnants of the town on either side of Sixmile Creek have been designated an archaeological historic district, and were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

<doc id="105495" wikidata="Q2221295" url="?curid=105495" title="Tyonek, Alaska">
<text>Tyonek or Present / New Tyonek (Dena&#x27;ina: &quot;Qaggeyshlat&quot; - ″little place between toes&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kenai Peninsula Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. As of the 2020 census the population was 152, down from 171 in 2010. In 1973, the community formed the Tyonek Native Corporation (TNC) under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and is federally recognized.

== History ==
A Dena&#x27;ina Alaska Native village at Tyonek was noted by the explorer James Cook in 1778. The Lebedev-Lastochkin Company, a Russian fur trade venture, maintained a small trapping station on the site of Tyonek. A detachment of the Vancouver Expedition under Joseph Whidbey visited the trading post in May 1794. Whidbey found that the LLC maintained &quot;one large house, about fifty feet long, twenty-four wide, and about ten feet high; this was appropriated to the residence of nineteen Russians...&quot; A smallpox epidemic in the late 1830s killed about half the population. Tyonek became a major port during the Resurrection Creek gold rush of the 1880s, but declined after the founding of Anchorage on the other side of Cook Inlet in 1915. Tyonek was moved to its current site when the original village, located on lower ground, flooded in the 1930s.

==Geography==
Tyonek is located at (61.060470, -151.230697). Although politically in the Kenai Peninsula Borough, it is located on the mainland on the northwest side of Cook Inlet, across from the Kenai Peninsula. It is bordered to the northeast by the community of Beluga.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.61%, are water. The CDP extends from Trading Bay in the west to the mouth of the Chuitna River in the northeast. The present village of Tyonek, with an airstrip, is in the northeast part of the CDP, between the Chuitna River and Tyonek Creek.

==Demographics==

Tyonek first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as the unincorporated Tinneh village of &quot;Toyonok Station and Village&quot;. It featured 117 residents, including 109 Tinneh, 6 Creole (Mixed Russian &amp; Native) and 2 Whites. This settlement was initially located at Beshta Bay. It returned again as &quot;Toyonok&quot; in 1890 with 115 residents, all Native. In 1900, it returned as Tyonek. It did not report on the 1910 census. It returned again in 1920. In 1930, it reported 78 residents, of which 74 were Native and 4 were White.

In the early 1930s, residents began to relocate northeast to a new site, the &quot;new&quot; Tyonek, situated on higher ground because of flooding. The original site became known as &quot;Old Tyonek&quot; or Tubughnen (&quot;beach land&quot;). Beginning with the 1940 census, the figures reflected the &quot;New / Second Tyonek&quot; or Tank&#x27;itnu (&quot;fish dock stream&quot;). Old Tyonek did not report separately again. The ″Present / New Tyonek″ or Qaggeyshlat (″little place between toes&quot;) was made a census-designated place (CDP) in 1980. The boundaries of the CDP now include the original (Old) Tyonek.

As of the census of 2000, there were 193 people, 66 households, and 45 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 134 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 4.66% White and 95.34% Native American. 2.59% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

The average household size was 2.92 and the average family size was 3.42.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 37.3% under the age of 18, 6.7% from 18 to 24, 33.7% from 25 to 44, 17.1% from 45 to 64, and 5.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 28 years. For every 100 females, there were 124.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 128.3 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $26,667, and the median income for a family was $29,792. Males had a median income of $26,250 versus $26,250 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $11,261.

<text>Ketchikan ( ; ) is a city in and the borough seat of the Ketchikan Gateway Borough on Revillagigedo Island of Alaska. It is the state&#x27;s southeasternmost major settlement. Downtown Ketchikan is a National Historic Landmark District.

With a population at the 2020 census of 8,192, up from 8,050 in 2010, it is the sixth-most populous city in the state, and thirteenth-most populous community when census-designated places are included. The surrounding borough, encompassing suburbs both north and south of the city along the Tongass Highway (most of which are commonly regarded as a part of Ketchikan, albeit not a part of the city itself), plus small rural settlements accessible mostly by water, registered a population of 13,948 in that same census.

Incorporated on August 25, 1900, Ketchikan is the earliest extant incorporated city in Alaska, because consolidation or unification elsewhere in Alaska resulted in the dissolution of those communities&#x27; city governments. Ketchikan is located on Revillagigedo Island, so named in 1793 by Captain George Vancouver.

Ketchikan is named after Ketchikan Creek, which flows through the town, emptying into the Tongass Narrows a short distance southeast of its downtown. &quot;Ketchikan&quot; comes from the Tlingit name for the creek, , the meaning of which is unclear. It may mean &quot;the river belonging to Kitschk&quot;; other accounts claim it means &quot;Thundering Wings of an Eagle&quot;. In modern Tlingit, this name is .

==History==

Ketchikan Creek served as a summer fish camp for Tlingit natives for untold years before the town was established by Mike Martin in 1885. He was sent to the area by an Oregon canning company to assess prospects. He established the saltery Clark &amp; Martin and a general store with Nova Scotia native George Clark, who had been foreman at a cannery that burned down.

Ketchikan became known as &quot;Alaska&#x27;s first city&quot; due to its strategic position at the southern tip of the Inside Passage, connecting the Gulf of Alaska to Puget Sound.

In 1905 a mission house was built, which in 1909 became the Yates Memorial Hospital. In 2020, the National Trust for Historic Preservation named the former hospital as one of America&#x27;s most endangered historic places.

==Totem poles==

Ketchikan has the world&#x27;s largest collection of standing totem poles, found throughout the city and at four major locations: Saxman Totem Park, Totem Bight State Park, Potlatch Park, and the Totem Heritage Center. Most of the totems at Saxman Totem Park and Totem Bight State Park are recarvings of older poles, a practice that began during the Roosevelt Administration through the Civilian Conservation Corps. The Totem Heritage Center displays preserved 19th-century poles rescued from abandoned village sites near Ketchikan. The Chief Kyan pole in Whale Park in the city center is one of the featured background images in most US passports.

==Geography==
Ketchikan&#x27;s GPS geographic coordinates are latitude 55.342 (slightly south of both Copenhagen, Denmark at 55.676 and Glasgow, Scotland at 55.864) and longitude -131.648. The city is located in southernmost Southeast Alaska on Revillagigedo Island, northwest of Seattle, Washington, southeast of Juneau, Alaska, and northwest of Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada. It is surrounded by the Tongass National Forest, which is managed by the United States Forest Service from its headquarters in the Ketchikan Federal Building downtown, and to the south by the Tongass Narrows, a narrow east–west saltwater channel, which is part of the Inside Passage.

Due to its steep and forested terrain, Ketchikan is long and narrow with much of the built-up area being located along, or no more than a few city blocks from, the waterfront. Elevations of inhabited areas range from just above sea level to about . Deer Mountain, a peak, rises immediately east of the city&#x27;s downtown area.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it (29.14%) is water.

The half-mile (800 m) wide channel called the Tongass Narrows separates Ketchikan from Gravina Island, where Ketchikan International Airport is located.

==Climate==
Ketchikan has a mild maritime or oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Dolk&quot;), characterized by heavy cloud cover and high humidity through much of the year and abundant rainfall throughout the year (even in the driest month), earning it the nickname of the &quot;Rain Capital of Alaska&quot;.

Winters are chilly but milder than its latitude alone may suggest: January has a 24-hour average of with an average daytime high of and an overnight low of . Further east and away from moderating maritime influence, winters on these parallels in inland North America are much colder. Summers are mild, as August&#x27;s temperature averages with an average daytime high of and an overnight low of . Rainfall averages per year, falling more heavily in autumn and winter. On average, the growing season (non-freezing temperatures) lasts about 6.3 months or 191 days, extending from about April 19 to about October 27.

The record high temperature in Ketchikan was on June 25, 1913. The record low temperature was on January 23, 1916. The wettest year was 1949 with and the driest year was 1995 with . The most rainfall in one month was during November 1917 and the most rainfall in 24 hours was on October 11, 1977. The most snowfall in one month was in January 1971.

There were 3,259 households. 30.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 37.6% were headed by married couples living together, 13.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 42.2% were non-families. 33.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.0% were someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.41, and the average family size was 3.07.

The population was spread by age ranges, with 23.9% under the age of 18, 9.5% from 18 to 24, 26.6% from 25 to 44, 29.3% from 45 to 64, and 10.7% who were 65 years of age or older.

About 12.4% of the population, including 19.8% of those under 18-years old, were below the poverty line. 90.0% spoke English, 6.0% Tagalog, 1.8% Spanish, and 0.7% Tsimshian as their first language.

==Media==
Ketchikan is home to four radio stations: KTKN-AM 930, KGTW-FM 106.7, KFMJ-FM 99.9, and community-owned NPR-affiliated KRBD-FM 105.3.

Ketchikan has one over-the-air broadcast television station, KUBD, Channel 13 digital and 4 visual, a CBS network affiliate.

Ketchikan also houses the publishing offices of the &quot;Ketchikan Daily News&quot;.

The region has local cable television programming provided by Ketchikan Public Utilities, including public meetings, Southeast Alaska programming, Ketchikan High School sports and events, local history, gardening and scenes, and a calendar of upcoming local events; local television signals carried on the cable system are also translations of Seattle and Anchorage stations.

==Government and infrastructure==

The City of Ketchikan operates under a council-manager form of government. The Ketchikan Gateway Borough includes both the City of Ketchikan and the City of Saxman and encompasses more than from the Canada–US border to just south of Wrangell. The Alaska Marine Highway System has its headquarters in Ketchikan.

Over the decades, Ketchikan has produced a number of political figures of note to Alaska in general. In territorial days, Norman Ray &quot;Doc&quot; Walker, a Canadian-born pharmacist practicing in Ketchikan, was arguablyfact the first career member of the Alaska Legislature. Walker served in the territorial Senate for 16 years before losing reelection in 1948. Ketchikan native Terry Gardiner was the youngest person elected to the Alaska House of Representatives at age 22.

The United States Coast Guard maintains a large shore installation, Coast Guard Base Ketchikan, south of the downtown area, which serves as a homeport to three cutters and as a regional maintenance base for Alaska.

One of Ketchikan&#x27;s two zip codes, 99950, is the highest-numbered in the United States.

==Economy and industries==

A major and first port of entry into Alaska, Ketchikan&#x27;s economy has been based on fishing industries, canneries in particular, tourism, government, and forestry. Average annual civilian employment in 2017 was 4,070, with a substantial seasonal work force peaking in July.

The area near the mouth of Ketchikan Creek earned Ketchikan a measure of infamy during the first half of the 20th century for a red-light district known as Creek Street, with brothels aligned on either side of the creek.

Ketchikan&#x27;s economy is currently based upon government services, tourism and commercial fishing. Civic boosters have dubbed the community the &quot;Salmon Capital of the World.&quot;

Ketchikan also receives a large number of tourists, both by air and sea, due to its popularity as a cruise ship stop. In 2018, Ketchikan Harbour saw 40 different cruise ships making more than 500 stops in the harbour and bringing more than 1,073,000 visitors to Ketchikan. The Great Alaskan Lumberjack Show, a lumberjack show, is performed near Ketchikan Creek between May and September.

The Misty Fiords National Monument is one of the area&#x27;s major attractions, and the Tongass National Forest has long been headquartered in Ketchikan, mostly in the city&#x27;s historic Federal Building. For most of the latter half of the 20th century, a large portion of Ketchikan&#x27;s economy and life centered on the Ketchikan Pulp Company pulp mill in nearby Ward Cove. The mill closed in 1997 in the wake of the passage of the Tongass Timber Reform Act of 1990, which reduced timber harvest targets in the national forest.

===Lumber===
Ketchikan Pulp Company (KPC), a subsidiary of Louisiana-Pacific Corp., was headquartered just outside Ketchikan&#x27;s city limits on the shores of Ward Cove. The company&#x27;s pulp mill opened in the cove in 1954. A 1995 joint EPA and FBI investigation of the company revealed it had dumped contaminated wastewater and sludge in the waters around Ward Cove, leaving them classified as &quot;impaired&quot; by the EPA. KPC plead guilty to the charges and agreed to pay a $3 million fine.

In 1996, following the Clinton Administration&#x27;s refusal to reinstate the original terms of KPC&#x27;s timber contract, Louisiana-Pacific Corp. announced it would be shutting down the pulp mill, and did so in March 1997. A total of 514 direct year-round jobs and more than 500 indirect jobs were lost as a result.

===Marine===

The Ketchikan Shipyard consists of two dry-docks (10,000 ton and 2,500 ton) owned and operated by Alaska Ship &amp; Drydock, a subsidiary of Vigor Industrial. It successfully launched the M/V &quot;Susitna&quot; in April 2010. A prototype ferry craft for use by Alaska&#x27;s Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the &quot;Susitna&quot; is the result of planning by Admiral Jay M. Cohen, former chief of the Office of Naval Research, and former Navy captain Lew Madden, then working as a project manager for Lockheed Martin.
The contract for two new Alaska-class day ferries in the Alaska Marine Highway was awarded to the shipyard on September 20, 2014, at a cost of $101 million.

=== Power and telecom ===
Companies involved in power and telecommunications include Ketchikan Public Utilities (KPU), which is city-owned, as well as GCI and Alaska Power and Telephone Company (AP&amp;T).

==Transportation==


Ketchikan serves as both an air and marine transportation hub for southern Southeast Alaska.

The Ketchikan International Airport serves as both a gateway for Alaska Airlines nonstop jet service to and from Seattle, Juneau, Sitka and Wrangell, with direct service to Anchorage, and as a bush carrier and charter aircraft hub for destinations such as Hyder, Metlakatla and Prince of Wales Island communities. Flying time to/from Seattle, Washington is approximately ninety minutes, making Ketchikan easily accessible to travelers from the continental U.S. Delta Air Lines began operating seasonal service to Seattle in May 2015.

Ketchikan receives service from two separate ferry lines. Ketchikan is a major port along the Alaska Marine Highway System&#x27;s Inside Passage route. Vessels depart northbound to Alaskan ports of call and southbound to Prince Rupert, British Columbia, a six-hour trip, — where a connection can be made to the BC Ferries system — and Bellingham, Washington, a thirty-six-hour voyage. Sailings depart several times each week. Ketchikan also sees regular day service from the Alaska Marine Highway vessel M/V &quot;Lituya&quot;, a day boat that shuttles between its homeport in Metlakatla, AK and Ketchikan.

The Inter-Island Ferry Authority serves Ketchikan with daily service from its homeport in Hollis on Prince of Wales Island.

==Education==

===Colleges and universities===
The former Ketchikan Community College became the Ketchikan campus of the University of Alaska Southeast during the late 1980s restructuring of the University of Alaska System. The campus is located on the uphill side of Ketchikan&#x27;s West End neighborhood and consists of two buildings, the Paul Building and the Ziegler Building. Both are named for prominent Ketchikan residents of the early and mid 20th century, William Lewis Paul and Adolph Holton Ziegler, respectively.

===Public education===
* Ketchikan Gateway Borough School District
** Ketchikan High School
** Revilla Junior/Senior High School
** Schoenbar Middle School

==Health care==
The city of Ketchikan and its surrounding areas are primarily served by the PeaceHealth Ketchikan Medical Center, which operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

==Sister cities and twin towns==
* Palm Desert, California
* Kanayama, Gifu, Japan [former]

Ketchikan&#x27;s former sister city of Kanayama, Gifu Prefecture, Japan, was incorporated along with four other cities into the larger city of Gero on March 1, 2004. An educational exchange program has been active between the two towns since 1986. Every year, Ketchikan and Kanayama exchange one teacher each to instruct middle-school level language classes in their respective tongues. In addition, Kanayama sends a group of students to Ketchikan during the spring, and students from Ketchikan travel to Kanayama the following summer. Ketchikan students travel across Japan, with the majority of their time spent in Kanayama with home-stay families, attending classes and touring the town.

<doc id="105499" wikidata="Q2018853" url="?curid=105499" title="Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula">
<text>The Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula or sinc interpolation is a method to construct a continuous-time bandlimited function from a sequence of real numbers. The formula dates back to the works of E. Borel in 1898, and E. T. Whittaker in 1915, and was cited from works of J. M. Whittaker in 1935, and in the formulation of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem by Claude Shannon in 1949. It is also commonly called Shannon&#x27;s interpolation formula and Whittaker&#x27;s interpolation formula. E. T. Whittaker, who published it in 1915, called it the Cardinal series.

==Definition==

Given a sequence of real numbers, &quot;x&quot;[&quot;n&quot;]=&quot;x&quot;(&quot;nT&quot;), the continuous function

:formula_1

(where &quot;sinc&quot; denotes the normalized sinc function) has a Fourier transform, &quot;X&quot;(&quot;f&quot;), whose non-zero values are confined to the region :formula_2. When the parameter &quot;T&quot; has units of seconds, the bandlimit, 1/(2&quot;T&quot;), has units of cycles/sec (hertz). When the &quot;x&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] sequence represents time samples, at interval &quot;T&quot;, of a continuous function, the quantity &quot;f&quot;&quot;s&quot; = 1/&quot;T&quot; is known as the sample rate, and &quot;f&quot;&quot;s&quot;/2 is the corresponding Nyquist frequency. When the sampled function has a bandlimit, &quot;B&quot;, less than the Nyquist frequency, &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is a perfect reconstruction of the original function. (See Sampling theorem.) Otherwise, the frequency components above the Nyquist frequency &quot;fold&quot; into the sub-Nyquist region of &quot;X&quot;(&quot;f&quot;), resulting in distortion. (See Aliasing.)

==Equivalent formulation: convolution/lowpass filter==
The interpolation formula is derived in the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem article, which points out that it can also be expressed as the convolution of an infinite impulse train with a sinc function:

:formula_3

This is equivalent to filtering the impulse train with an ideal (&quot;brick-wall&quot;) low-pass filter with gain of 1 (or 0 dB) in the passband. If the sample rate is sufficiently high, this means that the baseband image (the original signal before sampling) is passed unchanged and the other images are removed by the brick-wall filter.

==Convergence==
The interpolation formula always converges absolutely and locally uniformly as long as

:formula_4

By the Hölder inequality this is satisfied if the sequence formula_5 belongs to any of the formula_6 spaces with 1 ≤ &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞, that is

:formula_7

This condition is sufficient, but not necessary. For example, the sum will generally converge if the sample sequence comes from sampling almost any stationary process, in which case the sample sequence is not square summable, and is not in any formula_6 space.

==Stationary random processes==
If &quot;x&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] is an infinite sequence of samples of a sample function of a wide-sense stationary process, then it is not a member of any formula_9 or Lp space, with probability 1; that is, the infinite sum of samples raised to a power &quot;p&quot; does not have a finite expected value. Nevertheless, the interpolation formula converges with probability 1. Convergence can readily be shown by computing the variances of truncated terms of the summation, and showing that the variance can be made arbitrarily small by choosing a sufficient number of terms. If the process mean is nonzero, then pairs of terms need to be considered to also show that the expected value of the truncated terms converges to zero.

Since a random process does not have a Fourier transform, the condition under which the sum converges to the original function must also be different. A stationary random process does have an autocorrelation function and hence a spectral density according to the Wiener–Khinchin theorem. A suitable condition for convergence to a sample function from the process is that the spectral density of the process be zero at all frequencies equal to and above half the sample rate.

<text>Akhiok ( in Alutiiq; ) is a second-class city in Kodiak Island Borough, Alaska, United States. Akhiok is Kodiak&#x27;s southernmost village. The population was 63 at the 2020 census. Akhiok, which does not have a post office, is a rural location in postal code 99615 that belongs to Kodiak. The village is sometimes called Alitak, after a nearby bay.

==Location and climate==
Akhiok is located at 56.945560° North, 154.17028° West (Sec. 28, T037S, R031W, Seward Meridian). Akhiok is in the Kodiak Recording District, and the 3rd Judicial District.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 23.92%, is water.

Akhiok is located at the southern end of Kodiak Island at Alitak Bay. It lies southwest of the city of Kodiak, and southwest of Anchorage.

The climate of the Kodiak Islands is dominated by a strong marine influence. There is little or no freezing weather, moderate precipitation, and frequent cloud cover and fog. Severe storms are common from December through February. Annual precipitation is . Temperatures remain within a narrow range, from .

==History and culture==
Akhiok is an Alutiiq village dependent upon fishing and subsistence activities. The original village of Kashukugniut was occupied by Russians in the early 19th century. The community was originally a sea otter hunting settlement, located at Humpy Cove. The name Akhiok was reported in the 1880 census. In 1881, residents relocated to the present site at Alitak Bay. The relocation was, in part, based on the switch to a fishing economy. Most families gain their livelihood from fishing, either directly by fishing for salmon and halibut or by working in a nearby cannery. The community&#x27;s Russian Orthodox church, Protection of the Theotokos Chapel, was built around 1900 at the site of an earlier structure. A post office was established in 1933. Residents of nearby Kaguyak relocated to Akhiok after the 1964 earthquake and tsunami destroyed their village. The city was incorporated in 1972.

==Demographics==

Akhiok first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as an unincorporated native village, all 114 residents were Native Alaskans. It was returned as Alitak in 1890 (accounting for the dramatic increase in population, it included the village of Akhiok and those working in the cannery at Olga Bay). It did not appear on the 1900 census. It appeared as Akhiok (or alternatively as Achiok) on the 1910 and 1920 census. In 1930, it was returned as &quot;Alltak&quot; (likely an erroneous spelling). In 1940, it reported as Alitak again. From 1950 to date (2010), it has returned as Akhiok, incorporating in 1972.

As of the census of 2000, there were 80 people, 25 households, and 17 families residing in the city. The population density was 10.1 people per square mile (3.9/km). There were 34 housing units at an average density of 4.3 per square mile (1.7/km). The racial makeup of the city was 2.50% White, 86.25% Native American, 3.75% Asian, and 7.50% from two or more races. 1.25% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 25 households, out of which 36.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 36.0% were married couples living together, 20.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.0% were non-families. 28.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.20 and the average family size was 3.94.

In the city, the age distribution of the population shows 35.0% under the age of 18, 17.5% from 18 to 24, 26.3% from 25 to 44, 16.3% from 45 to 64, and 5.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 24 years. For every 100 females, there were 122.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 108.0 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $33,438, and the median income for a family was $37,813. Males had a median income of $25,417 versus $6,250 for females. The per capita income for the city was $8,473. There were 5.3% of families and 9.9% of the population living below the poverty line, including 12.5% of under eighteens and none of those over 64.

==Public services==
Water is derived from a dam and reservoir on a small stream, is treated and stored. Akhiok provides a piped gravity water and sewer system that serves all 25 homes in the community. A new water source is needed. A new landfill site is under development. Electricity is provided by City of Akhiok.

There is one school in the community, Akhiok School of the Kodiak Island Borough School District, attended by 16 students.

Local hospitals or health clinics include Akhiok Medical Clinic (907-836-2230). Akhiok Medical Clinic is a Primary Health Care Facility. Akhiok is classified as an isolated village. It is found in EMS Region 2G in the Kodiak Region. Emergency Services have coastal and air access. Emergency service is provided by volunteers and a health aide. Auxiliary health care is provided by Akhiok Village Response Team (Clinic 907-836-2230); flight to Kodiak or Anchorage.

==Economy and transportation==

Public sector employment and seasonal work provide cash flow in the community. Five residents hold commercial fishing permits. Almost all of Akhiok&#x27;s residents depend heavily on subsistence fishing and hunting. Salmon, crab, shrimp, clams, ducks, seal, deer, rabbit and bear are utilized. The community is interested in developing a fish smokery and cold storage facility. Since January 2003, each Akhiok shareholder received $200,000 from sales of a $36 million trust fund provided in the Exxon Valdez oil spill settlement.

The city is accessible only by air and water. Island Air Service offers regular passenger service. In addition, Regular and charter flights are available from the city of Kodiak. There is a state-owned gravel runway (Akhiok Airport; AKK) long by wide, and a seaplane base at Moser Bay, owned by Columbia Ward Fisheries. Barge services are sporadic. A breakwater and boat launch are available, but the existing dock is a temporary structure.

Taxes: Sales: None, Property: 9.25 mills (Borough), Special: 5% Accommodations Tax (Borough); 0.925% Severance Tax (Borough)

<doc id="105501" wikidata="Q3736354" url="?curid=105501" title="Harry Browne">
<text>Harry Edson Browne (June 17, 1933 – March 1, 2006) was an American writer, libertarian political activist, and investment advisor. He was the Libertarian Party&#x27;s presidential nominee in the U.S. elections of 1996 and 2000 running on a platform that advocated abolishing the federal income tax, privatizing Social Security, ending the war on drugs, and drastically reducing the size and scope of government. A leading figure in the modern libertarian movement, Browne was a passionate advocate for personal freedom, limited government, and voluntary cooperation. He authored 12 books that in total have sold more than 2 million copies including his influential work &quot;How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World&quot; (1973), which provided a blueprint for achieving individual liberation by rejecting societal constraints and embracing self-reliance. Through his presidential campaigns, writings, and public appearances, Browne articulated a vision of a society free from coercion, inspiring generations of libertarians to challenge political and cultural orthodoxy.

==Career==

===Armed services===

He was inducted into the U.S. Army on May 5, 1953. He went to the Southwestern Signal Corps Training Center at Camp San Luis Obispo, California to study cryptography. On October 4, 1953, he was sent to Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands, where the 1954 Operation Castle hydrogen bomb tests were conducted.

In 1955, Browne was sent to Eniwetok to finish his tour of duty and afterwards was transferred to the Army Reserves at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. He was released from active military service on July 17, 1956. He was honorably discharged from the armed forces on February 28, 1961, and discharged from the Army Reserves on July 1, 1961.

===Activist and author===

Browne worked as an advertising and sales executive in the 1960s. He then devoted himself full-time to the &quot;Americanist&quot; cause. He believed that the newspapers of America would willingly buy material promoting the American way of life; so, in 1961 he took on the proprietorship of American Way Features, Inc., a newspaper feature service, and as managing editor inaugurated a plan to turn the service from a subsidized program into a profit-making service. It sold &quot;Americanist&quot; features, in competition with all the recognized syndicates. His own column, The American Way, appeared in over 200 newspapers throughout America.

In the summer of 1962, Browne was named the advertising manager for the Liberty Amendment Committee&#x27;s bimonthly &quot;American Progress for Economic Freedom&quot;. In October he was named associate editor, and in November he was the editor. The following Spring the magazine was renamed &quot;Freedom Magazine&quot;, and Browne continued as its editor until February 1964 when he turned his full-time attention to the American Way Features, Inc.

===Investment theory and the &quot;Permanent Portfolio&quot; concept===

Also in the 1960s, Browne taught courses such as: The Economics of Freedom, The Tools of Success, Tools of the Market, The Economics of Success, and The Art of Profitable Living&quot;. Browne was an investment advisor for much of his life and developed the so-called &quot;permanent portfolio&quot; investment strategy, which claims to identify the four types of economic conditions that can apply over a given investment period, and the appropriate asset classes that give both profit from the upside of these conditions, and some measure of protection when they cease to prevail.

Browne published his first book, &quot;How You Can Profit From The Coming Devaluation&quot;, in 1970. Browne&#x27;s second book, &quot;How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World&quot;, was published in 1973. &quot;You Can Profit from a Monetary Crisis&quot; was Browne&#x27;s third book. He continued to write and publish books including his personal finance book, &quot;Fail-Safe Investing: Lifelong Financial Security in 30 Minutes&quot;, published in 2001. According to Browne&#x27;s web site, he was a consultant to the Permanent Portfolio Fund which utilizes some of the investment strategies described in his book, &quot;Fail-Safe Investing&quot;. Browne also authored books and gave lectures on actively living a libertarian lifestyle. His book &quot;How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World&quot; gave a detailed explanation of how one can bring libertarian concepts to every aspect of one&#x27;s life. His posthumously released 1960s lecture series, &quot;The Art of Profitable Living,&quot; was released as a 20-CD album titled, &quot;Rule Your World.&quot;

==Presidential campaigns==
Browne was the presidential nominee of the United States Libertarian Party in the elections of 1996 and 2000. He received 485,798 votes or 0.5% of the vote in 1996 and 384,516 votes or 0.4% of the vote in 2000.

His campaign qualified for matching funds during each election but did not accept them, per his campaign platform. Browne&#x27;s refusal to accept matching funds won him expected praise from libertarians and those who are against the concept of federal matching funds, but also earned him somewhat greater exposure in the &quot;mainstream&quot; media. Browne said he needed to be true to what he had preached in his libertarian speeches and that &quot;it would be highly inappropriate for me to stick my nose in the trough after having denounced the Republicans and Democrats for doing so.&quot; During both of these elections, the Libertarian Party was on the ballot in all fifty states and the District of Columbia. Browne did not appear on the 2000 Arizona ballot, however, as the Arizona Libertarian Party instead chose to run L. Neil Smith, whose candidacy was a protest against that of Browne.

Claims of wrongdoing by Libertarian National Committee staffers during Browne&#x27;s 1996 presidential campaign surfaced during his second run in 2000. Browne responded to allegations surrounding the controversy.

==Later life==
After the 2000 election, Browne continued to work to increase the popularity of libertarian goals. In addition to writing and making appearances on behalf of the Downsize DC Foundation (an organization he helped to co-found and for which he served as director of public policy for a year and a half), he hosted two weekly network radio shows, one on Saturdays dealing with politics, which he often called &quot;The Libertarian Conversation&quot; (since listeners were encouraged to call in), and the other on Sundays, called &quot;The Money Show&quot;, dealing with financial topics. Both of these radio programs were on the Genesis Communications Network. Browne also worked with the Free Market News Network, of which he was the president for much of 2005 and a senior political analyst. Via Free Market News, he had his own internet-based television show called &quot;This Week in Liberty&quot;, which ran for 25 episodes.

Near the end of his life, he worked on a book called &quot;The War Racket: The Lies, Myths, and Propaganda that Feed the American War Machine&quot;. War, he contended, was just another government program, and was essentially flawed because &quot;government never solves anything.&quot; According to Jim Babka, &quot;As Harry explained to me, the book was unlike any other he had ever written. Harry was well-read in his history, but after starting on the project he realized that &#x27;well-read&#x27; wasn&#x27;t enough.&quot; According to Browne&#x27;s wife, Pamela, he collected over 400 books, read almost all of them, and made copious notes. He was struggling with the book&#x27;s structure at the time of his death.

Browne also authored thousands of articles and was a contributor to the news and opinion blog LewRockwell.com, to Antiwar.com, and to World Net Daily. He published the financial newsletter &quot;Harry Browne Special Reports&quot; from 1974 to 1997.

==Death==
On March 1, 2006, Browne died of ALS at his home in Franklin, Tennessee. He was 72 years old. Later that month Browne was eulogized by U.S. Congressman Ron Paul.

<text>Kodiak (Alutiiq: ) is the main city and one of seven communities on Kodiak Island in Kodiak Island Borough, Alaska. All commercial transportation between the island&#x27;s communities and the outside world goes through this city via ferryboat or airline. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city is 5,581, down from 6,130 in 2010. It is the tenth-largest city in Alaska.
Inhabited by Alutiiq natives for over 7,000 years, Kodiak was settled in 1792 by subjects of the Russian crown. Originally named Paul&#x27;s Harbor, it was the capital of Russian Alaska. Russian harvesting of the area&#x27;s sea otter pelts led to the near extinction of the animal in the following century and led to wars with and enslavement of the natives for over 150 years. The city has experienced two natural disasters in the 20th century: a volcanic ashfall from the 1912 eruption of Novarupta and a tsunami from the 1964 Alaska earthquake.
After the Alaska Purchase by the United States in 1867, Kodiak became a commercial fishing center which continues to be the mainstay of its economy. A lesser economic influence includes tourism, mainly by those seeking outdoor adventure trips. Salmon, halibut, the unique Kodiak bear, elk, Sitka deer (black tail), and mountain goats attract hunting tourists as well as fishermen to the Kodiak Archipelago. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game maintains an office in the city and a website to help hunters and fishermen obtain the proper permits and learn about the laws specific to the Kodiak area.
The city has four public elementary schools, a middle and high school, as well as a branch of the University of Alaska. An antenna farm at the summit of Pillar Mountain above the city historically provided communication with the outside world before fiber optic cable was run. Transportation to and from the island is provided by ferry service on the Alaska Marine Highway as well as local commercial airlines.

==History==
===Indigenous peoples===
Archaeological evidence suggests that the Kodiak Archipelago has been home to the Alutiiq for at least 7,000 years. In their language, &quot;qikertaq&quot; means &quot;island&quot;.

===Russian control: 1700s–1867===

The first Europeans to sight Kodiak Island were the explorers Vitus Bering and Aleksei Chirikov, during the 1741 Second Kamchatka Expedition. In the early 1750s the Russian fur trading merchant and explorer Stepan Glotov met a Kodiak Islander in the Aleutian Islands, who told him about the island. On his next voyage Glotov sailed to Kodiak Island, arriving in 1763. The Russians called the island &quot;Kad’yak&quot; (), after the Alutiiq word &quot;qikertaq&quot;. Several other Russians made fur hunting voyages to Kodiak Island in the 1770s. In 1778 the British captain James Cook explored the area and wrote of &quot;Kodiak&quot; in his journals. In 1779 the Spanish explorers Arteaga y Bazán and Bodega y Quadra reached Afognak in the Kodiak Archipelago.
In 1792, the Russian Shelikhov-Golikov Company chief manager Alexander Baranov moved the post at Three Saints Bay (established in 1784) to a new site in Paul&#x27;s Harbor (, &quot;Svyato-Pavlovskoy Gavani&quot;). This developed as the nucleus of modern Kodiak. Baranov considered Three Saints Bay a poor location because it was too indefensible. The relocated settlement was first named &quot;Pavlovskaya Gavan&quot; ( – Paul&#x27;s Harbor).

A warehouse was built in what became one of the key posts of the Shelikhov-Golikov Company, a precursor of the Russian-American Company and a center for harvesting the area&#x27;s vast population of sea otters for their prized pelts. The warehouse still stands as the Baranov Museum. Because the First Native cultures revered this animal and would never harm it, the Russians had wars with and enslaved the Aleuts during this era.
Eastern Orthodox missionaries settled on the island by the end of the 18th century, continuing European settlement of the island. They held the liturgy in native Tlingit from 1800.

The capital of Russian America was moved to Novoarkhangelsk (modern-day Sitka) in 1804. The Russian-American Company was established in 1799 as a joint-stock company by decree of Emperor Paul to continue the harvest of sea otter and other fur-bearing animals and establish permanent settlements. By the mid-19th century, the sea otter was almost extinct and 85% of the First Native population had disappeared from exposure to European diseases.

===American control: 1867–present===
When Russia sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, Kodiak developed as a center for commercial fishing, and canneries dotted the island in the early 20th century until global farm-raised salmon eliminated these businesses. New processing centers emerged and the industry continues to evolve. During the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, animals such as the mountain goat, Sitka deer (black tail), rabbits, muskrats, beavers, squirrels, and others were introduced to the island and the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge was created.

Kodiak was severely impacted by the 1912 eruption of Novarupta. Though situated southeast of the eruption center, the town was covered with of ash over a short period of time. Townspeople sheltered in the U.S. Revenue Cutter Manning which was docked nearby.

As Kodiak was incorporated in 1941, the U.S. feared attack from Japanese during World War II, and turned the town into a fortress. Roads, the airport, Fort Abercrombie, and gun fortifications improved the island&#x27;s infrastructure. When Alaska became a state in 1959, government assistance in housing, transportation, and education added additional benefits.
In March 1964, a tectonic tsunami struck the city during the 1964 Alaska earthquake with waves that killed 15 people and caused $11 million in damage. Some areas near Kodiak were permanently raised by . It wiped out the neighboring Native villages of Old Harbor and Kaguyak. The Standard Oil Company, the Alaskan King Crab Company, and much of the fishing fleet were also destroyed.

==In popular culture==
In 2012, rapper Pitbull was involved in an advertising campaign with Walmart, in which the Walmart store that received the most Facebook &quot;likes&quot; from June 18 to July 15, 2012, would have Pitbull visit and put on a show there. An orchestrated internet campaign urged people to vote for the most remote location imaginable, Kodiak, resulting in a sizable lead for that store. The enthusiasm for voting for Kodiak was also a reference to the lyrics of Pitbull&#x27;s song &quot;Give Me Everything&quot;, in which he rhymes &quot;Kodak&quot; with &quot;Kodak&quot;. Walmart confirmed that Kodiak won. Pitbull visited on July 30, where he received a Key to the City from mayor Branson and then made an appearance before a crowd of hundreds at the Coast Guard base.

The Weather Channel docu-series &quot;Coast Guard Alaska&quot; follows the lives of Coast Guard members stationed in Kodiak.

Czech carmaker Škoda Auto named their new SUV the Škoda Kodiaq, after the Alaskan brown bear, and in tribute Kodiak was renamed &quot;Kodiaq&quot; for one day (May 6, 2016). In a spelling change also intended to honor the indigenous Alutiiq, the city was renamed with a number of signs changed across town, including the port facilities and city limits. The letter Q is a common ending for nouns in the Alutiiq language.

The film &quot;The Guardian&quot; (2006) is partially set in Kodiak, but was not filmed there.

Today two monastic communities—Saint Archangel Michael Skete for men and Saint Nilus Skete for women—live in close proximity to St. Herman&#x27;s hermitage and strive to follow St. Herman&#x27;s example of prayer, simplicity, and living off the land and sea. The two sketes, affiliated with Saint Herman of Alaska Monastery in Platina, California, are under the jurisdiction of Bishop Maksim Vasiljević of the Serbian Orthodox Church in North and South America.

==Education==
The Ouzinkie School, a K-12 rural school, is operated by the Kodiak Island Borough School District.

== Public services ==
In 2021, Ouzinkie became a part of the Energy Transitions Initiative Partnership Project via the Renewable Energy Alaska Project; the project will help the city (and several other remote villages in Alaska) develop renewable energy sources and increase its energy efficiency.

<text>Iliamna (Dena&#x27;ina: ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Lake and Peninsula Borough, Alaska, United States. The population was 108 at the 2020 census, slightly down from 109 in 2010.

==History==

Iliamna was originally the name of an Athabaskan village at the point where the Iliamna River flows into Iliamna Lake, about east of present-day Iliamna. That site is now called Old Iliamna (Dena&#x27;ina: &quot;Nuch&#x27;ak&#x27;dalitnu’&quot;). In 1935, the residents of Old Iliamna moved to the present-day location.

The first sport fishing lodge in Iliamna was built in the 1930s, and the second was built in the 1950s. Many more were built later in the 20th century. Iliamna&#x27;s economy has two main elements: subsistence fishing and hunting and sport fishing lodges. Year-round residents largely pursue subsistence activities, while summer workers from other areas work in the lodges.

Around 1913, Herman Gartelmann, Jack Kinney, and Ed Ahola built a roadhouse here, taking advantage of air travel through Lake Clark Pass. Jack and Ed were from Old Iliamna village. Frederick Roehl purchased the roadhouse around 1917, and when he died in 1923, Hans Seversen took over and the facility became known as Seversen&#x27;s Roadhouse. He started hosting big game hunters in 1921 and the first sport fishermen in 1937. Martin Seversen ran the operation from 1946 and put up a new building. Mary Seversen Clark sold the operation in 1956.

Iliamna faces the prospect of developing into a mining town, as several multi-national companies plan to develop the area northwest of the village into one of North America&#x27;s largest gold-copper-molybdenum mines. The first company to submit plans to the State of Alaska is Northern Dynasty Minerals, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hunter Dickinson. The Lake and Peninsula Borough, the region&#x27;s governing body, passed a strong resolution in support of the mine&#x27;s development, but the majority of the surrounding villages adamantly oppose it. Two non-profit organizations are leading the fight against open-pit mining in the Bristol Bay watershed - the Bristol Bay Alliance and the Renewable Resources Coalition. A study concluded in 2006 indicated the majority of Alaskans were opposed to the development.

==Geography==
Iliamna is located in southwest Alaska at (59.765135, -154.840312). It is bordered to the south by the city of Newhalen, to the west by the Newhalen River, and to the southeast by Iliamna Lake.

Nondalton is an Athabascan Indian (Tanaina and Iliamna) village. The name means &quot;lake after lake&quot; in their language: the village is situated along one of a line of lakes. Nondalton was first recorded in 1909. The village was originally located on the north shore of Six Mile Lake, but was moved to the present location in 1940, due to the depletion of wood and the growth of mud flats.

Subsistence hunting and fishing are the major economic activities. Government is by tribal council. There is a food store with a post office attached, a state-certified public school providing pre-kindergarten through 12th grade instruction, an outpatient medical clinic with family social services, a maintained Russian Orthodox church, a fishing lodge, and a water purification plant. Uncertified water is usually piped to most houses; septic tanks are used for sewage; and electric power and telephone service is available. Nondalton is on a boil drinking water notice indefinitely.

Nondalton is isolated: there are no highways or roads connecting it to other villages. The primary means of access and egress to the village is by airplane: a privately owned airport for single-engine craft services the village.

Among the issues affecting the village at the start of the 21st century is the proposed Pebble Mine site in the vicinity of nearby Lake Iliamna.

==History==

Houston Siding was first listed on a blueprint map of the Alaska Railroad in 1917 as part of the growing mining operations in the area. It was heavily used by the U.S. Navy during World War II, after which the mines were abandoned.

Houston was incorporated as a third-class city in 1966, and later re-designated as a second-class city in 1973.

Other notable events in the city&#x27;s history include:

* On August 30, 1972, George Boney, the chief justice of the Alaska Supreme Court and at the time the youngest chief justice of any U.S. state supreme court, died in Houston (at Cheri Lake) in a boating accident which resulted in drowning.
* On June 3, 1996, the Miller&#x27;s Reach wildfire covered more than in Houston and adjacent Big Lake. Property loss included 454 buildings; it cost over $16 million USD.

==Legal firework sales==

Houston, Alaska is home to the Gorilla Fireworks Stand along its Parks Highway, providing a wide range of pyrotechnic explosions and products to the public. The city allows the sale of fireworks, which are prohibited throughout the Mat-Su Borough and Anchorage, and the sales taxes generated from those help pay for emergency services. These stands are the only place to purchase fireworks legally in Southcentral Alaska, and provide entertainment to many residents and visitors of the state. Taxes from fireworks sales at Houston&#x27;s parks highway stands cover 10-15% of the city fire department&#x27;s budget.

Fireworks buyers are charged a 2% sales tax, plus an additional 2% tax. This policy was approved by the voters of Houston in 2010, and was made permanent by the City Council. The additional tax was meant to “promote increased public safety”, and all the tax take goes to the fire department.

==Cannabis legalization==

In 2014, Alaska voters approved the legalization of recreational marijuana and its retail sale. However, local governments were given the right to ban commercial grow operations or pot sales within city limits. While Palmer and Wasilla originally banned marijuana sales and grow operations, Houston attempted to bolster its city revenues by allowing marijuana commerce. The mayor of Houston, Virgie Thompson, believed that cannabis excise and sales taxes could cover expenses for a new city police force.

Houston issued the first limited grow room license in the Matsu Valley to Lacey and Ron Bass in 2016. In 2021, marijuana tax revenue alone comprised over 33% of Houston&#x27;s total collected taxes.

<text>Palmer is a city in and the borough seat of the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska, United States, located northeast of Anchorage on the Glenn Highway in the Matanuska Valley. It is the ninth-largest city in Alaska, and forms part of the Anchorage Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city is 5,888, down from 5,937 in 2010.

Palmer hosts the annual Alaska State Fair, and is also the headquarters of the National Tsunami Warning Center.

==History==


The city was named after George Palmer, a trader.

In the late 19th century, the U.S. government began to take interest in the Matanuska coal fields located north of Palmer. This interest sparked financiers to consider constructing the Alaska Central Railroad in 1904. The advent of World War I created a need for high-quality coal to fuel U.S. battleships, and by 1917 the US Navy had constructed rail from the port of Seward to the Chickaloon coal deposits. At the end of World War I, the U.S. Navy distributed land in the coal fields to war veterans and additional land was opened to homesteading. Farmers, miners and homesteaders began to populate the area. The Palmer Post Office was opened July 6, 1917, under the name of Warton. With railroad accessibility, new markets for agriculture began to open up for farmers in the Matanuska Valley.

In one year, Palmer transformed from a mere whistle stop rail siding to a planned community with modern utilities and community services. Eleven million dollars from Federal Emergency Relief Administration was spent to create the town of Palmer and relocate 203 families from the hard hit Iron Range region of Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Families traveled by train and ship to Palmer, arriving in May 1935. Upon their arrival they were housed in a city tent during their first Alaskan summer. Each family drew lots for tracts and their farming adventure began in earnest. The failure rate was high, but many of their descendants still live in the area and there are still many operating farms in the Palmer area, including the Vanderwheele and Wolverine farms. In 1971, the National Outdoor Leadership School started operating wilderness education courses in the nearby Talkeetna and Chugach mountain ranges from a local historic farmhouse, the Berry House, which is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In addition to an agrarian heritage, the colony families brought with them Midwest America&#x27;s small-town values, institutional structures, and a well-planned city center reminiscent of their old hometowns in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Many of the structures built are now in a nationally recognized historic district. Construction of the statewide road system and the rapid development of Anchorage has fueled growth around Palmer. Many Palmer residents commute 45 minutes to work in Anchorage.

==Geography==
Palmer is northeast of Anchorage on the Glenn Highway. It lies on the north shore of the Matanuska River, not far above tidewater, in a wide valley between the Talkeetna Mountains to the north and the Chugach Mountains to the south and east. Pioneer Peak rises over above the town, just a few miles south. East of Palmer is Lazy Mountain, and standing behind that is Matanuska Peak. Lazy Mountain, Matanuska Peak, and Pioneer Peak are all a part of the Chugach Range. North of Palmer are the Talkeetna Mountains. Hatcher Pass, a local favorite for hiking, skiing and other recreational activities, is located in this mountain range about from Palmer.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.
Palmer and Wasilla are the two major old-town cores of the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. Population of the area has grown dramatically in the past decade; Borough officials estimate the local population at 8,000.

Apart from road access, Palmer can be accessed by the Palmer Municipal Airport and the Palmer Depot of the Alaska Railroad. Neither of these has regularly scheduled service. However, when the Alaska State Fair operates, the Alaska Railroad operates a special train from Anchorage to Palmer (though it did not operate in 2021).

===Climate===
Palmer has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: Dsc). Despite this classification, the city receives noticeably more precipitation in summer, with August being the wettest month. However, April, one of the six warmer months is sufficiently drier than October and December, hence the letter &#x27;s&#x27; is used instead of &#x27;f&#x27; (as in &quot;Dfc&quot;).

Palmer has a climate similar to that of Anchorage, although with low temperatures that are on average cooler and highs warmer. On average, over the course of a year, there are 28–29 days of sub- lows, 22–23 days of + highs, and 0.8 days of + highs. The town straddles the border between USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 4b and 5a, indicating the coldest temperature of the year is typically around . Palmer is flanked by two glaciers, the Matanuska Glacier and the Knik Glacier. Wind blows through the Matanuska and Knik River Valleys into the town frequently. If there is a substantial snowfall, it will often sit for several days before most of it is blown away. These warm winds can raise winter temperatures for a couple days at a time, and are often called &quot;Chinook winds&quot; by the local people.

==Demographics==
As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 5,937 people, 1,472 households, and 1,058 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 1,555 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 80.9% White, 2.1% Black or African American, 8.2% Native American, 1.1% Asian, 0.3% Pacific Islander, 1.2% from other races, and 6.3% from two or more races. 3.5% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 14.9% were of German, 10.5% United States or American, 8.9% Irish and 8.7% English ancestry according to Census 2000.

There were 1,472 households, out of which 47.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.3% were married couples living together, 16.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.1% were non-families. 23.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.81 and the average family size was 3.29.

In the city, the age distribution of the population shows 33.6% under the age of 18, 11.8% from 18 to 24, 28.7% from 25 to 44, 16.8% from 45 to 64, and 9.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 29 years. For every 100 females, there were 98.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.6 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $45,571, and the median income for a family was $53,164. Males had a median income of $44,716 versus $25,221 for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,203. About 6.0% of families and 12.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 12.6% of those under age 18 and 4.2% of those age 65 or over.

==Arts and culture==

===Alaska State Fair===

Palmer is most noted in Alaska as the location of the annual Alaska State Fair, where Palmer&#x27;s agricultural spirit lives on. The Alaska State Fair holds contests for largest vegetable in several categories, and many national and even world records have been recorded at the fair, with the cabbage, radish, spinach and lettuce categories usually dominating local interest. There are rides and festivities, local artists on display, local venders and food trucks, and popular musical artists at the ConcoPhilips Borealis Theatre. In 2008, Scott Robb of Palmer won 1st place and a $2,000 prize for his cabbage.

===Palmer Museum of History and Art===
Palmer hosts a log cabin Visitor Information Center in the heart of downtown that entertains more than 35,000 visitors each year. Each summer, the visitor center employs a full-time gardener to maintain the of public gardens that showcase more than 600 locally grown plant varieties. The Palmer Museum of History and Art is located in the Visitor Information Center and offers visitors a chance to view artifacts from Palmer&#x27;s history, provides maps to historical places to see and stocks guidebooks for more information on local attractions.

===The Church of a Thousand Trees===
A couple of blocks away from the Visitor Information Center is the United Protestant Church (aka The Church of a Thousand Trees), a Presbyterian church. It was built in 1936–37 and is one of the 17 structures that contribute to the National Register&#x27;s Matanuska Colony Historic District.

=== Friday Fling ===
The Friday Fling is a local downtown event that takes place around the public library and train depot. Many small local businesses and farmers gather to sell goods.

==Parks and protected areas==
Twelve miles north of Palmer is Hatcher Pass, a scenic mountainous pass. It has been established as a state park and is the home of the Independence Mine. It serves as a local back-country area for skiers, snowboarders, snowmachiners, and hikers as well as a tourist attraction in the summer months.

The area is also home to the Kepler-Bradley Lakes State Recreation Area, which grants access to numerous small lakes, the Finger Lake State Recreation Area, and a number of city parks.

==Sports==

The Mat-Su Miners, a franchise in the Alaska Baseball League, a high-level summer collegiate baseball league, play their games at Hermon Brothers Field on the State Fairgrounds. Colony High School bands play pep rally music, and different venders get together to bring a large crowd to support. With Division I collegiate players from all over the United States, the Miners have twice captured the coveted National Baseball Congress championship, in 1987 and 1997. Alaska Raceway Park is a nearby dragstrip. The Valley Steelers, a semi-pro football team within the Alaska Football League, play their home games at Palmer High School.

==Education==
Primary and secondary education in Palmer is a part of the Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District. Within city limits, there are two elementary schools (Swanson Elementary and Sherrod Elementary), one middle school (Palmer Jr. Middle School) and one high school (Palmer High School).

Palmer High is of modest size, with 649 students and 73 staff members. In 1999, It became the first school in Alaska to offer the International Baccalaureate program. About ten minutes from Palmer High is &quot;cross-town&quot; rival Colony High School.

Palmer is also home to Alaska Bible College, the state&#x27;s only accredited school of theology and ministry, and Matanuska-Susitna College, an extended college of the University of Alaska Anchorage.

The Palmer Alaska Job Corps is at 800 E. Lynn Martin Drive, across from the Hageland airfield.
The Ya Ne Dah Ah School (YNDA School), operated by the Athabascan Nation Chickaloon Village, uses Alaska Native methods to teach children. It was established in 1992. It is funded with grant money. In 2012 the school did not receive an annual grant which would allow it to fund Athna language and cultural programs, and it failed to receive Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funds since the BIA had a 1995 rule preventing it from funding Alaska Native programs.

<text>Susitna is a census-designated place (CDP) in Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska, United States. It is part of the Anchorage Metropolitan Area. As of the 2020 census, the population of the CDP was 11.

Susitna was once home to the legendary Athabaskan elder, historian and ethnologist Shem Pete (c1896-1989), who documented countless locations travelling thousands of miles within the Matanuska-Susitna region. His works were published in &quot;Shem Pete&#x27;s Alaska: The Territory of the Upper Cook Inlet Dena&#x27;ina&quot;.

==Geography==
Susitna is located in southwestern Matanuska-Susitna Borough at (61.557631, -150.576743). It is primarily on the west side of the Susitna River, north of where the river flows into Cook Inlet. A portion of the CDP containing the actual settlement of Susitna is on the east side of the river, about as the crow flies southwest of Houston and west of Wasilla.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Susitna CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.25%, are water.

==Demographics and history==

Susitna first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as the unincorporated Tinneh villages of Sushetno (combined total of 90 residents, all Tinneh, although they were listed separately as &quot;Sushetno (1st) and (2nd) Villages&quot; (with a population of 44 and 46, respectively). It was not specified which was the present village of Susitna. In 1890, it returned as &quot;Sushitna&quot; (including 2 other villages on Susitna River). All of the residents were Native. It did not return on the 1900 census. In 1910, it returned as Susitna, with a peak population of 233. It returned in 1920 as &quot;Susitna Station.&quot;

In 1930, census enumerators returned it as two separate places: &quot;Susitna&quot; and &quot;Susitna Station.&quot; It was divided on race, with Susitna Station (population 52), having 51 White residents and 1 Native and Susitna being the &quot;native village&quot;, with 39 residents (all native). Depending upon the boundaries of the recording districts (whose maps have not confirmed which side of the 3rd Judicial District they were located within), each was listed in two different districts: Susitna was located in Talkeetna and Susitna Station in Wasilla. This may be erroneous, but further research is needed on the matter.

In 1940, it returned as &quot;Susitna Station&quot; again, with just 12 residents. It did not report again until 1960, when it returned as Susitna. It would not appear again after that until 2000, when Susitna was made a census-designated place (CDP). It was greatly enlarged from its original location on the east bank of the Susitna River to take in both sides of the river, and now the bulk of its area is on the west bank today.

As of the census of 2000, there were 37 people, 19 households, and 6 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 102 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 89.19% white, and 10.81% from two or more races.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 21.6% under the age of 18, 5.4% from 18 to 24, 24.3% from 25 to 44, 27.0% from 45 to 64, and 21.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 44 years. For every 100 females, there were 105.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 107.1 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $22,500, and the median income for a family was $51,250. Males had a median income of $51,250 versus $0 for females.

<text>Talkeetna (Dena&#x27;ina: &quot;K&#x27;dalkitnu&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska, United States. At the 2020 census the population was 1,055, up from 876 in 2010.

==Geography==
Talkeetna is located at the confluence of three rivers, the Susitna, Chulitna, and Talkeetna. Talkeetna began in 1916 when the area was chosen as a district headquarters for the Alaska Railroad. A post office opened as well as a sawmill, trading post, cigar and donkey store and other businesses as well as many cabins. In 1917, the residents encouraged the government to survey the lots on which their homes stood. In 1919, the railroad surveyed and auctioned eighty lots, 41 of which already had permanent structures on them. The average price at the sale was $14.25.

Flightseeing, rafting, mountain biking, homestead tours, hiking, camping, fishing and hunting make up a large portion of the local economy. Talkeetna is a 2½-hour drive from Anchorage, the largest city in Alaska. The core downtown area (Talkeetna Historic District) is on the register of National Historic Places, with buildings dating from the early 1900s including Nagley&#x27;s General Store, Fairview Inn and the Talkeetna Roadhouse.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (3.19%) is water.
===Climate===

The climate is continental subarctic (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;), assuming some characteristics like warm-summer but the shorter duration of the hot season and long winters give the town boreal features and in terms of vegetation is composed of taiga (Cook Inlet Basin), different from the southcentral coastal more diversified. Even though the cold, dry air comes from the north, the moisture acquired comes from the Gulf of Alaska. That is, summers are between a short duration and an average duration. It is lighter than Yellowknife, Canada at similar latitudes due to the moderating effect of the Pacific Ocean and the adiabatic warming of the descending air from the surrounding mountains. The average annual temperature is 0.8 °C, the average precipitation is not as high but relatively well distributed during the year, about 686 mm on average.
;Notes: 
==Demographics==

Talkeetna first appeared on the 1920 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It was made a census-designated place (CDP) in 1980.

There were 358 households, out of which 28.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.0% were married couples living together, 7.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 49.4% were non-families. Thirty-eight percent of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.16 and the average family size was 2.92.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 23.3% under the age of 18, 5.8% from 18 to 24, 35.4% from 25 to 44, 29.4% from 45 to 64, and 6.1% who were 65 years of age or older.

==Economy==
Talkeetna is the base for expeditions to Denali. The Denali National Park&#x27;s Walter Harper Talkeetna Ranger Station is located in Talkeetna. Tourists travel to Talkeetna each summer to fish salmon, raft and go flightseeing. Products by local artists, musicians and craftspeople are available in area stores.

===Susitna Dam===
The Susitna Dam is a proposed hydroelectricity plan from the State of Alaska. On July 25, 2011, the Governor of Alaska signed a bill to construct the dam on the glacier-fed Susitna River. The dam, if built to its full design height, would become the fifth-tallest of the nearly 850,000 dams on Earth. The Susitna River, America&#x27;s 15th-largest by volume, flows unimpeded for from glacial mountains through one of the planet&#x27;s last wild landscapes to meet the Pacific near Anchorage.

Soon after the dam&#x27;s construction was announced, the Coalition for Susitna Dam Alternatives was formed to fight its construction. It is their argument that recreation, nature and the town would be severely threatened by the dam, and have compared it to the Three Gorges Dam in China.

==Events==

Every March, the Oosik Classic Ski Race is organized by the Denali Nordic Ski Club. Distances are approximate and trail conditions are variable.

The Moose Dropping Festival, a two-day celebration held each July to raise funds for the Talkeetna Historical Society, came to an end with the announcement on August 21, 2009, by the organization that the festival had been canceled. The 2009 event had drawn record crowds, resulting in multiple arrests and injuries, including one death. The event was named after a lottery in which participants bet on numbered, varnished pieces of moose feces, or &quot;moose droppings&quot; dropped from a helicopter onto a target.

In December, the Wilderness Woman and Bachelor Auction &amp; Ball takes place.

Talkeetna&#x27;s largest celebration of the winter, called Winterfest, takes place during the entire month of December, and features a motorized Parade of Lights, a Christmas tree in the Village Park, a Taste of Talkeetna, and numerous special events hosted by local businesses and special events at Talkeetna Public Library.

Clothing company Carhartt sponsors an event in Talkeetna every winter. The attendees tell stories about the mechanical, animal, and other encounters their Carhartt clothes have survived.

==Government==

Since Talkeetna is only a census-designated place, it is unincorporated. Talkeetna has a Community Council and its mayor was a cat named Stubbs from 1997 until his death in 2017. It is located in Matanuska-Susitna Borough&#x27;s District 7, which is represented by Assembly Member Vern Halter, who succeeded borough mayor Larry DeVilbiss.

A popular rumor states Stubbs was elected following a successful write-in campaign by voters who opposed the human candidates. However, according to NPR, the cat could not have been elected as a write-in candidate because &quot;The tiny town has no real mayor, so there was no election&quot;. Stubbs&#x27; position is honorary as the town is unincorporated. On August 31, 2013, Stubbs was attacked and mauled by a dog while roaming the streets and after treatment at the local veterinarian returned home on September 9. Stubbs died on July 21, 2017, at the age of 20 years and 3 months. A cat named Aurora has been the unofficial mayor of Talkeetna since 2017, succeeding Stubbs.

===Legislative representation===


;Representation in the Alaska Senate
* District E (1959–1967) – two-member, at-large district for the Third Division, which consisted of nearly all of Southcentral Alaska and most of Southwest Alaska
** Ralph E. Moody, D-Anchorage (1959–1960; resigned to accept appointment as attorney general, seat left unfilled until start of next legislature)
** Irene E. Ryan, D-Anchorage (1959–1961)
** Vance Phillips, R-Anchorage (1961–1965)
** Howard W. Pollock, R-Anchorage (1961–1963, 1965–1967)
** Nicholas J. Begich, D-Fort Richardson and Spenard (1963–1967)
* District G (1959–1967) – single-member district which covered an area coterminous with the present-day Municipality of Anchorage and Matanuska-Susitna Borough
** J. Earl Cooper, D-Anchorage (1959; resigned to accept appointment to judgeship)
** Seaborn J. Buckalew, Jr., D-Anchorage (1960–1961; appointed to replace Cooper)
** Brad Phillips, R-Anchorage (1961–1967)
The area-based apportionment scheme, established in the Alaska Constitution, was abolished following the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot;, affirmed by the Alaska Supreme Court in its decision in &quot;Nolan v. Wade&quot;. Both houses of the legislature were apportioned based strictly on population from this point forward.
* District D (1967–1983)
** Jan M. Koslosky, R-Palmer (1967–1973)
** Jalmar M. Kerttula, D-Palmer (1973–1983)
* District I (1983–1985) – represented by Jalmar M. Kerttula throughout its existence
* District E (1985–1993) – the previous District I, coterminous with both the MSB and the two-member House District 16, was changed due to further redistricting ordered through the decision in &quot;Carpenter v. Hammond&quot;. The new district was a two-member district, with designated seats A and B, and combined the MSB with portions of Anchorage and the Kenai Peninsula Borough. This &quot;donut district&quot;, which encircled most of Anchorage, was ruled improper in a later court case, No further redistricting was ordered, however, due to the fact that this decision was reached approximately 2 years before the start of the next redistricting cycle.
** District E, Seat A
*** Jalmar M. Kerttula (1985–1993)
** District E, Seat B
*** Edna B. DeVries, R-Palmer (1985–1987)
*** Mike Szymanski, D-Anchorage (1987–1991)
*** Curt Menard, D-Wasilla (1991–1993)
Subsequent redistrictings created 40 House districts and 20 Senate districts. This was included with the redistricting amendments to the Alaska Constitution ratified by voters in 1998, which means that future redistricting boards are compelled to follow the same scheme.
* District N (1993–2003)
** Jalmar M. Kerttula (1993–1995, lost reelection)
** Lyda Green, R-Wasilla (1995–2003)

==Education==
Talkeetna Elementary School is located near the heart of downtown. Grades K–6 are taught at this location. The mascot of Talkeetna Elementary School is the Timber Wolf.

A new Susitna Valley Junior-Senior High School opened in January 2010, replacing the one that burned to the ground in June 2007 while repairs were being made to the roof. In the interim, classes were held in portables on the grounds of the Upper Susitna Senior Center. The mascot of Susitna Valley Junior-Senior High School is the Ram.

==Media==
Talkeetna has a community radio station, 88.9 KTNA, with locally hosted shows and NPR programming. Talkeetna has a local newspaper, the &quot;Good Times&quot;, which has a distribution of 7,500 year-round and serves the communities of Talkeetna, Trapper Creek, Willow, Houston and Big Lake, with additional distribution along the Parks Highway as far north as Nenana during the summer months. The &quot;Good Times&quot; is currently published every other week in print. Publishers of the &quot;Good Times&quot; also publish a local area phone book and an annual visitors’ guide. Another newspaper, &quot;The Alaska Pioneer Press&quot;, which was under different ownership and was published monthly, ceased publication in January 2011, after its owners moved out of the area. Whole Wheat Radio, an independent webcast, began broadcast in 2002, which was relatively early, and ceased in 2010.

==Transportation==
Talkeetna is served by Talkeetna Airport, which is home to several air taxi companies that provide flightseeing trips and support for mountain climbers. Many of the air taxi companies were started to ferry climbers from Talkeetna to Denali, as Talkeetna has the easiest access to the south side of the mountain where the main base camp is located. Legendary bush pilots such as Don Sheldon and Cliff Hudson, both based out of Talkeetna, pioneered glacier flying on Denali (formerly Mount McKinley). Their companies, Talkeetna Air Taxi and Hudson Air Service (now operating as Sheldon Air Service), respectively, are still in operation.

The Talkeetna Airstrip is a restricted use airstrip and on the list of National Historic Places also.

Talkeetna is a stop on the &quot;Denali Star&quot;, &quot;Aurora Winter Train&quot;, and &quot;Hurricane Turn&quot; trains of the Alaska Railroad.

Sunshine Transit provides public transit for the Upper Susitna Valley runs five days a week along the Talkeetna Spur Road. It serves the communities of Talkeetna, Trapper Creek, Willow and Houston

==In popular culture==
The town of Talkeetna was mentioned in Travel Channel&#x27;s &quot;Man v. Food&quot;. In season 2 episode 16, the host travels to the Roadhouse, a restaurant in Talkeetna, to sample their unique breakfast dishes. Also featured is West Rib Pub &amp; Cafe.

The town of Cicely from the television series &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; has been said that it could be patterned after Talkeetna by a journalist, but it has not been confirmed by any cast member. Filming actually took place in Roslyn, Washington.

Talkeetna features heavily in &quot;Railroad Alaska&quot; on Discovery Channel. The show has three seasons and deals with the lives of people who work the railway, and off-the-grid residents who depend on the railroad for supplies and access to medical facilities.

A fictionalized portrayal of the town was featured in the Disney film &quot;Snow Dogs&quot;.
