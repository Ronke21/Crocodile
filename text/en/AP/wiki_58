<text>Max Weinberg (born April 13, 1951) is an American drummer and television personality, most widely known as the longtime drummer for Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band and as the bandleader for Conan O&#x27;Brien on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. He is the father of former Slipknot drummer Jay Weinberg.

Weinberg grew up in suburban New Jersey and began drumming at an early age. He attended college planning to be a lawyer but got his big break in music in 1974 when he won an audition to become the drummer for Springsteen. Weinberg became a mainstay of Springsteen&#x27;s long concert performances. Springsteen dissolved the band in 1989, and Weinberg spent several years considering a law career and trying the business end of the music industry before deciding he wanted to continue with drumming.

In 1993, Weinberg got the role as bandleader of The Max Weinberg 7 for &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Weinberg&#x27;s drums-driven jump blues sound and his role as a comic foil prospered along with the show, giving him a second career. In 1999, Springsteen re-formed the E Street Band for a series of tours and albums; Weinberg worked out an arrangement that allowed him to play with both O&#x27;Brien and Springsteen. In 2009, Weinberg moved to the short-lived &quot;Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; as leader of Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band. Upon that program&#x27;s conclusion, Weinberg was not invited to follow O&#x27;Brien to the new &quot;Conan&quot; show. Weinberg continued playing with Springsteen, and in 2014 was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the E Street Band.

==Early life==
Weinberg was born on April 13, 1951, to a Jewish family in Newark, New Jersey, to parents Bertram Weinberg, an attorney, and Ruth Weinberg, a high school physical education teacher. He has three sisters, Patty, Nancy and Abby. He grew up in Newark as well as in the neighboring suburban towns of South Orange and Maplewood.

The young Max was exposed to music early on, attending Broadway shows weekly from the age of two and liking the big sound put forth by the pit orchestras. He then liked the rhythms of country and western music. He knew he wanted to be a drummer from the age of five, when he saw Elvis Presley and his drummer, D. J. Fontana, appear on &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot; in April 1956. Decades later, Weinberg said, &quot;I think anybody who wanted to develop a life in rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music had a moment. That was my moment,&quot; and Fontana became a major influence on him. Weinberg received a child&#x27;s conga drum from his father after he watched a TV show featuring bandleader Xavier Cugat. In a 2020 article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Weinberg described the drum as having a &quot;... a real calfskin head and a white strap. I played it all over the house.&quot;

Weinberg has also acknowledged The Ventures as a major influence on him in a TV interview in 1988 to celebrate that band&#x27;s 30th anniversary and he actually sat in on drums during the performances.

Weinberg started playing at the age of six. His first public appearance came at the age of seven when he sat in on a bar mitzvah band playing &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In&quot;. The bandleader, Herbie Zane, was the leading act for bar mitzvahs and weddings in the area; he was impressed with young Weinberg and brought him along on other engagements as a kind of novelty act. Weinberg thus became a local child star, drumming in a three-piece mohair suit. He gained an appreciation for showmanship and was a fan of Liberace and Sammy Davis, Jr. He grew to idolize drummer Buddy Rich and become a fan of Gene Krupa and saw drummer Ed Shaughnessy of Doc Severinsen&#x27;s band on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; as having an ideal job as well as admiring the level of playing and serious sartorial style of the Tonight Show musicians. Weinberg stayed with Zane until junior high school and learned rhythms such as cha-chas, merengues, polkas, and the hora and playing everything from Dixieland jazz to Acker Bilk&#x27;s &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot;.

Weinberg attended Temple Sharey Tefilo-Israel, a Reform Judaism congregation in South Orange, where he was inspired by a local rabbi and had what he later described as &quot;a wonderful Jewish background.&quot; He would later say that the Jewish concept of seder, meaning order, became key to his vision of how a good drummer serves his band&#x27;s music. Witnessing his father lose two summer camps in The Poconos impressed upon him the fragility of economic success and led to a strong work ethic. His father&#x27;s financial setbacks also provided a reason for Weinberg to find steady work as a drummer, while still in his teens and attending high school, to help his family pay bills.

When the British Invasion hit in 1964, the Beatles and their drummer, Ringo Starr, became a huge influence on Weinberg. He began playing in local New Jersey rock bands, playing the music of The Rolling Stones, Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels, and The Young Rascals. While a member of The Epsilons, he played at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. He attended Columbia High School in Maplewood; there he knew Leigh Howard Stevens, who would become a famous percussionist in his own right. Weinberg graduated from Columbia High in 1969. Another band he was in, Blackstone, recorded an eponymous album for Epic Records in 1970.

Weinberg first attended Adelphi University, and later Seton Hall University, majoring in film studies. His general goal was to become a lawyer, but he was still most viscerally interested in a music career and kept his drum set in his car in case any chances to play arose. He performed at weddings, bar mitzvahs, and bars, then landed a job in the pit band for the Broadway musical &quot;Godspell&quot;.

==Success with the E Street Band==
Weinberg was still living at home when he met Bruce Springsteen on April 7, 1974, when his band, The Jim Marino Band, were Springsteen&#x27;s support at Seton Hall. Springsteen had parted ways with his drummer, Vini &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Lopez, earlier that year, and the replacement, Ernest &quot;Boom&quot; Carter, lasted only six months before leaving with pianist David Sancious to form Tone. Weinberg answered a Springsteen &quot;Village Voice&quot; newspaper ad that famously requested, &quot;no junior Ginger Bakers,&quot; in reference to Ginger Baker&#x27;s reputation for long drum solos. Weinberg auditioned with Springsteen and the core E Street Band in mid-late August of that year at the SIR studios in Midtown Manhattan, bringing a minimalist drum kit with him consisting only of hi-hats, a snare drum and a bass drum. He knew one Springsteen song from the Marino band, &quot;Sandy&quot;, and played it. His drumming on the Fats Domino song &quot;Let the Four Winds Blow&quot; sealed the position as his. A week later, he was offered the $110 per week job (US$ in dollars), and he quit college immediately, about six academic credits short of a degree. Weinberg&#x27;s first public performance came on September 19, 1974, at The Main Point in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.
Weinberg rose to success as the drummer for Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band, as his powerful yet controlled beat solved the E Street Band&#x27;s drumming instabilities. On &quot;Born to Run&quot; (1975), Weinberg&#x27;s drumming evoked two of his idols, Ringo Starr and Levon Helm, and he covered his snare drum with heavy paper towels to capture some of the Memphis soul sound. While travelling on tour, Weinberg became known for his exact requests, such as specifying the particular brand of paper towels to use for his drums or the standards for his hotel rooms. Weinberg never adopted the &quot;rock and roll lifestyle&quot;; he treated his music seriously and kept to the mantra, &quot;Show up, do a good job, and give them more than their money&#x27;s worth.&quot; One compromise Weinberg did have to make was sometimes playing on the High Holy Days. During shows, Springsteen built up the personas of his bandmates, and Weinberg was frequently referred to as &quot;the Mighty Max&quot;. Weinberg started a long practice of keeping his eyes on Springsteen every moment during the show, even when Springsteen was behind the stage, as he never knew when Springsteen would change a tempo or suddenly deviate from the set list. Decades later, E Street guitarist Steve Van Zandt would say of Weinberg, &quot;What nobody understands is that not only is Max a great drummer, Max reads Bruce&#x27;s mind. You can&#x27;t learn that.&quot; Weinberg bought a house overlooking the water in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, triggering a lifelong interest in real estate and home design.

Tempos slowed to an oft dirge-like pace on &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; (1978); rehearsals and recording of the album stretched out over a long period, with Springsteen and bandmate and co-producer Steven Van Zandt experiencing a prolonged frustration over their inability to capture a more resonant drum sound. Weinberg soon regretted not playing faster on &quot;Badlands&quot;, and tempos did speed up on that number and some others during the accompanying Darkness Tour. He did later say that &quot;It was a ballsy thing to play a single stroke roll through the entirety of &#x27;Candy&#x27;s Room and that it was the kind of choice a session musician never would have tried.

Weinberg suffered an acknowledged &quot;drumming slump&quot; around 1980, and his time-keeping skills were criticized by Springsteen. What could pass unnoticed in concert became apparent on record, and Weinberg practiced drumming components for months in order to regain a fine sense of timing. Weinberg also suffered from repetitive stress injury and tendinitis, eventually requiring seven operations on his hands and wrists. He studied for a while with noted jazz drummer Joe Morello; Weinberg credited Morello for helping him to learn how to play with the tendinitis.
The River Tour Springsteen and E Street Band shows that opened New Jersey&#x27;s Meadowlands Arena in 1981 became one of the highlights of Weinberg&#x27;s career.

On June 22, 1981, Weinberg married Rebecca Schick, a Methodist who had grown up in Tinton Falls, New Jersey, and whom he had met through a mutual friend. Springsteen and the band played at their wedding, which was officiated by the same rabbi that Weinberg had while growing up. Becky Weinberg worked as a high school history teacher. They had two children, daughter Ali (born c. 1987) and son Jay (born 1990).

In 1984, they bought a farm in Monmouth County; after feeling taken advantage of in the deal, Weinberg became a scrupulous researcher in real estate matters, often spending days at town halls looking over obscure zoning regulations. While on tour, he studied books about architecture, and dreamt of building houses in the style of Frank Lloyd Wright or Richard Meier. 

He made a full recovery from his injuries in time for &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; (1984), which featured an aerobics-timed beat on some tracks that also owed something to the popular Phil Collins drum sound. Weinberg&#x27;s own experimentation since the &quot;Darkness&quot; days had also led to a more reverberant sound. Overall, Weinberg&#x27;s more fluid drumming combined with Roy Bittan&#x27;s use of synthesizers and better overall production to give Springsteen a more modern sound, resulting in the album becoming Springsteen&#x27;s best-selling one ever and spawning a record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles. Springsteen later said of the album, &quot;Max was the best thing on the record.&quot; Weinberg&#x27;s most well-known drum part came on &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, where his snare drum paired against Bittan&#x27;s signature synthesizer riff on the opening and throughout the main part of the song. The recording then descends into improvised chaos; Springsteen had told Weinberg, &quot;When I stop, keep the drums going.&quot; Upon the restart, intentional drum breakdowns matched bass swoops and guitar feedback; Springsteen subsequently said of the performance overall, &quot;You can hear Max – to me, he was right up there with the best of them on that song.&quot; Weinberg said it was one of his most intense musical experiences.

On the subsequent Born in the U.S.A. Tour, Springsteen generally interspersed hard-rocking song sequences after every three or four numbers in order to give Weinberg&#x27;s hands a chance to recover. Weinberg&#x27;s wife Becky unintentionally triggered one of the tour&#x27;s most celebrated episodes. She was a fan of the &quot;This Week with David Brinkley&quot; television program and invited panelist George Will to the Washington-area Capital Centre show. After seeing the band perform, Will became convinced that they were exemplars of hard-working patriotism and traditional American values; he wrote, &quot;... consider Max Weinberg&#x27;s bandaged fingers. The rigors of drumming have led to five tendonitis operations. He soaks his hands in hot water before a concert, in ice afterward, and sleeps with tight gloves on.&quot; Will further decided that Springsteen might endorse Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential campaign and talked to the campaign, which later led to Reagan&#x27;s famous extolling of Springsteen at a stop in Hammonton, New Jersey, and Springsteen&#x27;s subsequent negative response.

For his efforts, Weinberg was named Best Drummer in the &quot;Playboy&quot; 1985 Pop and Jazz Music Poll and Best Drummer again in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 1986 Critics Poll. The adulation got to him a bit as he aligned with the Mighty Max persona and went to fashionable parties.

Weinberg had a reduced role on Springsteen&#x27;s 1987 &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; album, replacing Springsteen&#x27;s drum machine parts on a few tracks, but the full band was in place for the 1988 Tunnel of Love Express and Human Rights Now! tours. Weinberg called the latter tour&#x27;s visiting of many third-world spots around the globe one of the most rewarding things the band had done.

In 1984, Weinberg published &quot;The Big Beat: Conversations with Rock&#x27;s Greatest Drummers&quot;, a series of interviews conducted over two years with drummers from various eras, including Starr, Helm, D. J. Fontana, Charlie Watts, Dino Danelli, Hal Blaine and others. The book captured drummers revealing more about their musical approaches than they normally did to the press and was thus considered an important addition to the rock literature. In 1986, Weinberg began taking a one-man show &quot;Growing Up on E Street&quot; to college campuses around the country. It contained some short films that Weinberg produced as well as a question-and-answer session.

Weinberg also played as a session musician, enjoying particular success in connection with songwriter and producer Jim Steinman. He drummed on the 1977 Meat Loaf album, &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, playing on the Steinman-penned tracks &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, &quot;You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth&quot; and &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light&quot;. At a point in 1983, Weinberg was featured on the number one and number two songs on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, Bonnie Tyler&#x27;s &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; and Air Supply&#x27;s &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot;, both Steinman creations. Weinberg also recorded with Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, Gary U.S. Bonds, Ian Hunter and Carole King.

On October 18, 1989, Springsteen unexpectedly called Weinberg to say he was dissolving the E Street Band. As Weinberg later said, &quot;That&#x27;s why they call him the Boss.&quot;

==Breakup and career choices==
The news from Springsteen left Weinberg &quot;a zombie for about six months&quot;. Even before the band&#x27;s breakup, Weinberg had returned to school at Seton Hall University in early 1989. The band breakup occurred during his second semester at Seton Hall, on his way to completing the remaining 21 credits needed to obtain his bachelor&#x27;s degree in communications. He graduated from there later in 1989. He then briefly attended Yeshiva University&#x27;s Cardozo School of Law, but withdrew after six weeks. Weinberg asked Ringo Starr for advice on how to go on when the band that had made your life had broken up. Weinberg and Springsteen remained on friendly terms during this period.

In 1990, Weinberg began offering motivational seminars oriented towards corporations to augment his one-person college show business. He received the HERO Award from Big Brothers Big Sisters of America in October 1990 for his work for that organization. &quot;The Big Beat&quot; was republished in 1991.

Weinberg thought his career as a musician was over and considered himself retired as a drummer. He went into the music business instead, joining a distribution company as a business partner. He worked as an executive for the Music Master label. He formed his own record company, Hard Ticket Entertainment, in 1990. In 1991, they issued an album that he produced by a group he formed, Killer Joe, called &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot;. He had sought out this career path because &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to continually be competing with &#x27;Mighty Max&#x27;,&quot; but he found business life unfulfilling. Because of that, and for personal reasons as well, he needed to return to performing. Weinberg later reflected, &quot;I felt at times, after the E Street Band broke up, so anonymous it was painful.&quot;

He looked through the Yellow Pages for jobs and played at bar mitzvahs for $125; he later said &quot;[I] was glad to do it.&quot; Weinberg became the live drummer for 10,000 Maniacs in 1992 after their drummer Jerry Augustyniak was injured five days before a five-week tour. He went after that assignment once he heard it was open and later said, &quot;I lived on a bus and had a roommate. Not exactly like the E Street Band, but I loved it. It reminded me that I am a drummer and I&#x27;m good. I was put here to play the drums. To turn my back on that ability was wrong.&quot; He played at the January 1993 inauguration of Bill Clinton. Weinberg auditioned in 1993 to be the principal drummer on the Broadway show &quot;The Who&#x27;s Tommy&quot;, but was selected instead as the second substitute. Despite the very low pay, Weinberg was nevertheless happy: &quot;I&#x27;d buried drumming so far into my psyche. I felt I&#x27;d resurrected it.&quot; Of Springsteen&#x27;s work, Weinberg felt &quot;that I would never get to play these songs again.&quot;

==&quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;==

In July 1993, Weinberg had a chance sidewalk meeting outside the Carnegie Deli with newly selected &quot;Late Night&quot; host Conan O&#x27;Brien, where Weinberg spoke about his ideas for music on the show. O&#x27;Brien promised Weinberg an audition. Within a few days, Weinberg put together The Max Weinberg 7, recruiting musicians he had worked with during his career, including on the Killer Joe project, starting with guitarist and arranger Jimmy Vivino. Weinberg decided a muscular, drums-driven jump blues vibe, partly derived from the Killer Joe sound, is what he would use as a starting point for the group&#x27;s sound. At the early August audition, the outfit impressed O&#x27;Brien with their ability to play not just rock but also rhythm and blues, soul, jazz, pop, and big band swing; Weinberg was so anxious to land the job that he threw up afterward. After a final meeting with executive producer Lorne Michaels, they were hired as the house band. The band performed on the show every night since its premiere on September 13, 1993. O&#x27;Brien later said of the Weinberg choice, &quot;The energy and enthusiasm of his music coincided with the show I wanted to do. Plus, his tan offset my ghostly complexion.&quot; Weinberg held the title of music director on the show, while Vivino did most of the arranging. Of his career rebound, Weinberg said simply: &quot;I grabbed the brass ring twice.&quot;

In the early phases of the show, Weinberg was involved in occasional comedy bits, but mostly focused on his musical responsibilities, including the selection of walk-on music for guests. The band got a 30-second featured spot each night after O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s opening monologue. O&#x27;Brien often received poor notices during the early years of &quot;Late Night&quot;, and Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; pronounced the Max Weinberg 7 as the &quot;saving grace&quot; of the show. Weinberg established an image by dressing in high-quality suits and a tie; he said, &quot;I like us to look sharp and play sharp,&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t want to look like the audience, I want to look different.&quot; Weinberg became a television celebrity, and his visibility and stature grew from &quot;Late Night&quot; and established an image for him beyond Springsteen. Indeed, much of the show&#x27;s young fan base, and some of the staff on the show itself, were unaware of Weinberg&#x27;s past role in the E Street Band.

In 1994, Rhino Records released &quot;Max Weinberg Presents: Let There Be Drums&quot;, a three-volume set of CDs that highlighted drumming that Weinberg admired on songs from the 1950s through the 1970s. Recaps in 1998 of the first five years of &quot;Late Night&quot; concluded that the band had been an important element in the show surviving, with Weinberg&#x27;s personality providing a foil to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s and with &quot;the Max Weinberg 7 [leaving] television viewers wishing they were in the studio to hear more.&quot; Their sound also fit into the swing revival going on during the late 1990s.

In 2000, O&#x27;Brien sidekick Andy Richter left the show, and Weinberg became the &quot;second banana&quot;. Weinberg continued to present an obvious visual foil: as O&#x27;Brien said, &quot;If you looked at this guy you would never know he was the drummer in a huge rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band. You would say he was the guy who did the band&#x27;s accounting. But Max is the authoritative, buttoned-down adult in the midst of all this madness.&quot; Weinberg reveled in O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s youthful audience: &quot;To be 49 and appreciated by 14-year-olds again? What a thrill!&quot; Weinberg engaged in stare-downs with O&#x27;Brien and gave scripted screeds about newsmakers. Additionally, Weinberg was comically presented as a twisted character with sexual fetishes and homicidal tendencies in comedy bits. When O&#x27;Brien was host of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on March 10, 2001, his monologue featured a visit from the &quot;SNL&quot; studio to the &quot;Late Night&quot; studio (only a few floors apart in the same building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza), where O&#x27;Brien discovers Weinberg engaged in sexual intercourse on his desk with a woman played by Max&#x27;s real-life wife, Becky. Weinberg says of his comic persona: &quot;[I]t&#x27;s playing against type. I&#x27;ve been happily married for nearly 30 years, with two wonderful children. It&#x27;s not what I portray on the show, and that&#x27;s funny.&quot; Weinberg continued his one-man college shows, now titled &quot;E Street to Late Night: Dreams Found, Lost, and Found Again&quot;.

Weinberg returned to the E Street Band briefly when Springsteen re-grouped the band in early 1995 to record a few new songs for the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; release. The regrouping was only temporary and the band returned to inactivity. Also in 1995, Weinberg drummed on two of Johnnie Johnson&#x27;s songs: &quot;I&#x27;m Mad&quot; and &quot;She Called Me Out of My Name,&quot; on Johnson&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Johnnie Be Back&quot;. Weinberg spent two years building an house in Middletown Township, New Jersey, that they moved into in 1999; he picked up many of the furnishings for it from locations around the world during subsequent tours.

The Max Weinberg 7 released a self-titled album in 2000 on Hip-O Records; Weinberg said he waited until then because &quot;I wanted to change my style of playing and hone my style before I committed to a record.&quot; He was especially proud that the band had successfully backed Tony Bennett during a late 1990s appearance on &quot;Late Night&quot;: &quot;Two years ago if you&#x27;d asked me if I could play with Tony Bennett, I would have said absolutely not. I&#x27;m not in his league. But we played with him the other night, and it was wonderful. We swung.&quot;

==Reformation of the E Street Band==
Springsteen reunited the E Street Band in 1999 on a more lasting basis, for the Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Reunion Tour. This posed a dilemma for Weinberg, whose greater loyalty was to O&#x27;Brien and NBC. Indeed, up until then Weinberg had never missed a &quot;Late Night&quot; show, appearing in over 1,000 in a row. However, allowing Weinberg to tour for one of the highest-profile reunions in rock history was thought to be of long-term benefit to the television show&#x27;s appeal, and an arrangement was worked out wherein Weinberg took a leave of absence from &quot;Late Night&quot; in order to go out on this and subsequent tours. When he was tied up with Springsteen, drummer James Wormworth took his place, and the band was led by Jimmy Vivino (&quot;Jimmy Vivino and the Max Weinberg 7&quot;). When the Reunion Tour was extended in length, shows were generally restricted to weekends, so as to permit Weinberg to fulfill his &quot;Late Night&quot; responsibilities. At NBC, the coexistence between the drummer&#x27;s two bosses was known as the Weinberg-Springsteen Rule, and was not typically extended to other talent at the network.

While Weinberg did not forget the breakup and long separation, he viewed it as &quot;at the same time the most horrifying experience I&#x27;ve ever been through and the most liberating.&quot; In any case, he immediately felt comfortable playing with Springsteen once more: &quot;Right from the first downbeat of the first rehearsal, it was there again.&quot; His drumming for the E Street Band was more relaxed and mature than before, showing more confidence and finesse, and his hands and fingers were in better shape for having done the daily &quot;Late Night&quot; work. When the tour concluded with ten shows at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, on several days Weinberg taped the Conan show at Rockefeller Center in the late afternoon, put his hands in ice and changed from his suit into jeans and a vest, and played with Springsteen at night. The experience of doing both left him &quot;professionally speaking, as alive as I&#x27;ve ever felt.&quot; Of his position on the drum platform behind Springsteen, he says, &quot;I have the best seat in the house.&quot; His energy level was no less, as he could be seen jumping a foot off his seat during some songs. His daughter Ali joined the band on keyboards several times during the tour.

Weinberg&#x27;s steady drumming helped power Springsteen&#x27;s 2002 comeback album, and the first E Street Band studio recording in 18 years, &quot;The Rising&quot;. Weinberg took more time off from the Conan show to participate in the long and successful 2002–2003 Rising Tour. In the early 2000s, Weinberg was at the center of annual holiday benefit shows at Asbury Park Convention Hall, billed as Bruce Springsteen, the Max Weinberg 7 and Friends.

Weinberg was a member of the board of trustees of the Monmouth Conservation Foundation and won a conservation award in 2002. Nevertheless, during 2002 and 2003, he got into a prolonged local controversy over his plans to subdivide a portion of his Middletown Township, New Jersey, property into lots for new homes. Some of his neighbors strongly protested the move, and they and some in the press accused him of hypocrisy; Weinberg defended himself by saying the conservation foundation was not against all development, just thoughtless development. A scaled-down version of the plan was approved by the town&#x27;s zoning board, and in 2008 Weinberg went ahead with plans to sell the lots. Weinberg generally avoids political comments, but did campaign for John Kerry in the 2004 United States presidential election.

Springsteen himself also made appearances on &quot;Late Night&quot; in 1999, 2002, and 2006. Weinberg participated in the 2004 Vote for Change tour then drummed on Springsteen&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Magic&quot;. There, he was part of a core rhythm section comprising himself, Springsteen, bassist Garry Tallent, and pianist Roy Bittan, who did the tracks first; other members&#x27; contributions were added later. Weinberg then took more time off from the Conan show to do the 2007–2008 Magic Tour. Weinberg repeated his role in the core section in recording Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Working on a Dream&quot; album. Weinberg also fulfilled a long-time dream by going to Super Bowl XLIII in February 2009 with Springsteen and the E Street Band&#x27;s half-time performance, where he was joined by some of the other members of the Max Weinberg 7.

==Move to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;==
The ending of the O&#x27;Brien &quot;Late Night&quot; and beginning of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; coincided with the start of Springsteen and the E Street Band&#x27;s 2009 Working on a Dream Tour. O&#x27;Brien told a &quot;Variety&quot; reporter at the time of the announcement that he hoped that Weinberg would follow him to Los Angeles and that he also hoped an arrangement could be worked out to let Weinberg go on the road with Springsteen as had been done for past tours.
Whether Weinberg would stay with O&#x27;Brien and move or not became a subject of conflicting news reports. 
Nevertheless, O&#x27;Brien confirmed on February 18, 2009, that Weinberg and the band were indeed coming with him. Weinberg had not missed an E Street Band show since joining the outfit in 1974, and E Streeter Van Zandt said that no amount of rehearsal by another drummer could replace Weinberg&#x27;s &quot;intuitive understanding&quot; of Springsteen&#x27;s performance gambits.

The conflict was resolved when son Jay became a substitute drummer for his father during parts of the Working on a Dream Tour that Max could not make due to commitments to the O&#x27;Brien show. Springsteen said, &quot;Once again, I want to express my appreciation to Conan O&#x27;Brien, and everyone on his team, for making it possible for Max to continue to do double duty for both us and for him. We promise to return him in one piece.&quot; The younger Weinberg began playing during segments of the tour&#x27;s shows, and got a very positive response from audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band. Max Weinberg said Jay&#x27;s segments allowed him a &quot;total out-of-body experience. For the first time in – I&#x27;ve been with Bruce for 35 years – I&#x27;ve been able to go out in the audience and enjoy a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert.&quot; In one case, Jay did one show of a two-night stand on the East Coast and Max then took a red-eye flight back from Los Angeles to do the second.

&quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; premiered on June 1, 2009, with The Max Weinberg 7 now expanded to eight and referred to as Max Weinberg and the Tonight Show Band. Andy Richter was back as an announcer, making Weinberg&#x27;s role as a foil a little uncertain. Gradually, Weinberg and the band&#x27;s roles in the comic aspects of the show began to assert themselves. On June 25, Weinberg departed &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; temporarily for four weeks to join Springsteen and band part-way through their European leg; this was conveyed on the show via a comedy bit that had his drum riser turn into a float that took him outside the studio and purportedly to the airport. Weinberg returned to the show on August 3, after flying back from a Springsteen show that had ended early into the same morning in Spain. Of being &quot;Tonight Show&quot; bandleader, he said, &quot;I think one of the biggest thrills in my life was seeing my name in the same sentence as Doc Severinsen, who, in my view, is the gold standard for &#x27;Tonight Show&#x27; bandleaders. There&#x27;s never been anyone who did it quite near the class and the brilliance of Doc Severinsen in the original Tonight Show Band. I used to think when I was a kid what a great job that must be – you know, same place, every time, everyday. Lo and behold, here I am 40 years later, doing it. That sounds deep, deep, deep, deep, deeply satisfying to me.&quot; On September 25, Weinberg left &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; again for two months to join Springsteen and band for the final, American portion of the Working on a Dream Tour. The same drum-riser-to-float comedy bit was used, except this time the float was &quot;hit&quot; and demolished by a truck just outside the studio (and airing of the segment was delayed a few days due to O&#x27;Brien legitimately injuring himself during the same show). The tour wrapped on November 22, 2009, in Buffalo, New York; Weinberg was back on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; the next day. With no E Street Band projects in sight for at least the next year or two, Weinberg was left to concentrate on his bandleader role.

Even though Weinberg was living in Los Angeles for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, he retained his home in New Jersey and considered that his permanent residence: &quot;I&#x27;m not really moving. I&#x27;m living out here, but it&#x27;s more like an extended road trip.&quot; Regarding his decision to stay in music rather than pursue the legal profession, he has had no regrets: &quot;The world needs more drummers and fewer lawyers.&quot;

However, Weinberg&#x27;s stint as &quot;Tonight Show&quot; bandleader was not to last long. The 2010 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host and timeslot conflict erupted, and after an intense period of public turmoil, the last O&#x27;Brien show took place on January 22, 2010, finishing with Weinberg propelling a guest-filled seriocomic rendition of &quot;Free Bird&quot;. While O&#x27;Brien negotiated a settlement deal with NBC for himself and his staff, Weinberg as well as Richter had to reach their own agreements with the network.

==Departure from O&#x27;Brien and start of own bands==
In February 2010, Weinberg underwent a twelve-hour open heart valve repair surgery to correct a condition he had known about and had been monitoring since the mid-1980s. His recovery took place over three to five months, and Weinberg kept news about the operation private until an interview eight months later.

In April 2010, O&#x27;Brien began his The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour. While the rest of the group was part of the tour under the moniker The Legally Prohibited Band, Weinberg was not (except for a brief appearance at one show). Instead, he assembled and staged appearances by the Max Weinberg Big Band, a fifteen-piece ensemble with twelve horns that mostly plays the music of Frank Sinatra, Buddy Rich, Count Basie, and Maynard Ferguson. Weinberg&#x27;s interest in the genre dated back to his childhood and the artists he had seen on televised variety shows.

It was initially unknown whether Weinberg would be part of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s new late night show on TBS cable that began in November 2010, as no specifics had been worked out for that show while O&#x27;Brien focused on his tour. In June 2010, the Max Weinberg Big Band Tour began with a show in Red Bank, New Jersey&#x27;s Count Basie Theater. Weinberg said that he was booking appearances by his big band through 2011 and that with regard to O&#x27;Brien, &quot;I literally have not thought about it. There have been no discussions. It&#x27;s kind of an open question.&quot;

In September 2010, it was announced Weinberg would not be part of the show, now named &quot;Conan&quot;; Jimmy Vivino took over leadership of that band, with Wormworth replacing Weinberg full-time on drums. The split was stated as being mutual, with O&#x27;Brien saying, &quot;Max has been a huge part of my life for the past 17 years and he is an incredible bandleader and musician,&quot; and Weinberg thanking his band and saying, &quot;17 years – a lifetime on TV ... my association with Conan, his staff, and crew has been a deeply rewarding experience for me.&quot; Weinberg subsequently acknowledged that &quot;we both wanted to go in different directions,&quot; but both looked forward to Weinberg occasionally stopping by to sit in on the new show. Weinberg said his health was better than ever but that the &quot;life-changing experience emotionally and spiritually&quot; of the surgery, a desire to remain in New Jersey with his family, and an interest in exploring new musical directions had all played a role in his departure from O&#x27;Brien.

Another health scare happened in June 2011 when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He had surgery for it the following month with a favorable outcome, but did not reveal publicly the news of this health situation for another six years.

In 2013, Weinberg again found himself in a real estate dispute, threatening legal action against Monmouth County in connection with its attempt to repair damage to the Henry Hudson Trail in Atlantic Highlands following damage caused by Superstorm Sandy. Weinberg claimed that the work done in creating that portion of the trail, augmented by Sandy, had caused significant damage to two properties he and his wife owned there. The issue was still ongoing in 2014.

Weinberg played on only a couple of tracks on Springsteen&#x27;s March 2012 album &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;, but resumed his normal role with the E Street Band on the subsequent 2012–2013 Wrecking Ball Tour, this time augmented by percussionist Everett Bradley, as well as on its 2014 continuation, the High Hopes Tour. In 2014, Weinberg was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the E Street Band. He said of the honor, &quot;when you have that trophy in your hands, I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like that. ... You&#x27;re walking around with this big heavy symbolic recognition of the work you&#x27;ve done.&quot; Meanwhile, he continued to play in a jazz idiom on his own, now with the Max Weinberg Quintet. In late October 2014, Weinberg sat in for a surprise guest appearance on &quot;Conan&quot;. In early 2015, Weinberg received the Humanitarian of the Year Award from Temple Rodeph Torah in Marlboro, New Jersey, in recognition of his volunteering in association with multiple local groups; he said he was humbled to be accepting an award that focused on tikkun olam.

Weinberg once again hit the road with Springsteen and the E Street Band for the River Tour in January 2016, which in its various phases lasted until February 2017. He appreciated the shows on the first leg of the tour, where they played the entire 20-song &quot;The River&quot; album in sequence, because &quot;when you play something night after night you really get to dig into the material, just as an instrumentalist.&quot; He attributed his ability to keep playing during some of the longest shows in E Street Band history to his keeping in top physical condition, including exercise by swimming, and to his love of playing with Springsteen.

Once the tour was over, Weinberg said he would continue to appear with his various own bands, including doing weddings and bar and bat mitzvahs just as he had earlier in his career. He also liked to watch his son Jay play with Slipknot, although he conceded he did so from a safe zone where he would not get knocked down by the audience.

On December 14, 2021, Max Weinberg indicated that he felt a tour with Springsteen and the E Street Band was very likely in 2022 saying “Until the bus pulls up at my house, figuratively speaking, I’m not quite sure but I’m pretty convinced ... (that) myself, my colleagues and the people who are interested are going to be very pleasantly surprised in 2022. I don’t make plans for Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band but I feel very good about the next 18, 24 months.&quot;

==Equipment==
For many years, Weinberg&#x27;s gear included Slingerland Drums, Ludwig, Pearl Drums and Zildjian cymbals; he subsequently switched to DW Drums, but continues to use Zildjian cymbals. He also uses Remo heads and, previously having used Regal Tip drumsticks and brushes, he now uses Vater drumsticks, notably the 5A Nude wood tip model and Wire Tap brushes. His setup has always been simple, mostly consisting of a snare drum, mounted tom, bass drum and floor tom, while his usual cymbal setup consists of two crash cymbals, a ride cymbal and a pair of hi-hats, with an occasional third crash: &quot;I&#x27;ve got four drums. Anything more is redundant. Besides, I tend to trip over things.&quot;

==Personal life==
As of July 2020, Weinberg and his wife Becky live in Delray Beach, Florida. Among his valued possessions is the conga drum given to him by his father in 1957. During a 2020 Wall Street Journal interview, when asked why he still looks forward to touring with Springsteen, Weinberg said, &quot;A chance to prove I still have it. Playing with Bruce and the E Street Band is the height of what I do.&quot;

Weinberg did and does have strong New Jersey and East Coast ties. He lives on the New Jersey shore with his wife and children. He and his family are fans of the New Jersey Devils, and played ice hockey on the pond in front of their house. They were season ticket holders for the Devils until the children became too old and busy to attend games. Their son Jay had, without much instruction from his father but using Max&#x27;s old gear, become a drummer for local punk rock and metal bands. Their daughter Ali became an assistant to NBC News reporter Chuck Todd and began appearing on their MSNBC.com blog &quot;First Read&quot;. , Ali is now a foreign affairs producer at the PBS NewsHour. Weinberg played drums on the first album recorded by his sister Nancy Winston, a professional pianist and singer in New York City, known for her regular appearances at Cafe Pierre.

<doc id="100508" wikidata="Q968399" url="?curid=100508" title="Weyl's postulate">
<text>In relativistic cosmology, Weyl&#x27;s postulate stipulates that in the Friedmann model of the universe (a fluid cosmological model), the wordlines of fluid particles (modeling galaxies) should be &quot;hypersurface orthogonal&quot;. Meaning, they should form a 3-bundle of non-intersecting geodesics orthogonal to a series of spacelike hypersurfaces (hyperslices).

Sometimes, the additional hypothesis is added that the world lines form timelike geodesics.

==Intuitive significance==

The ADM formalism introduced a family of spatial hyperslices. This allows us to think of the geometry of &quot;space&quot; as evolving over &quot;time&quot;. This is an attractive viewpoint, but in general no such family of hyperslices will be physically preferred. The Weyl hypothesis can be understood as the assumption that we should consider only cosmological models in which there &quot;is&quot; such a preferred slicing, namely the one given by taking the unique hyperslices orthogonal to the world lines of the fluid particles.

One consequence of this hypothesis is that if it holds true, we can introduce a comoving chart such that the metric tensor contains no terms of form dt dx, dt dy, or dt dz.

The additional hypothesis that the world lines of the fluid particles be geodesics is equivalent to assuming that no body forces act within the fluid. In other words, the fluid has zero pressure, so that we are considering a dust solution.

==Relation to vorticity==

The condition that the congruence corresponding to the fluid particles should be hypersurface orthogonal is by no means assured. A generic congruence does not possess this property, which is in fact mathematically equivalent to stipulating that the congruence of world lines should be &quot;vorticity-free&quot;. That is, they should not be twisting about one another, or in other words, the fluid elements should not be swirling about their neighbors in the manner of the fluid particles in a stirred cup of some liquid. (Nonzero vorticity model is presented in https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1210/1210.4091.pdf or Nurgaliev I.S. «Singularities Are Averted by Vortices». Gravitation and Cosmology, 2010, Vol. 16, No. 4, pp. 313–315.)

<text>The Dymaxion house was developed by inventor and architect Buckminster Fuller to address several perceived shortcomings with existing homebuilding techniques. Fuller designed several versions of the house at different times—all of them factory manufactured kits, assembled on site, intended to be suitable for any site or environment and to use resources efficiently. A key design consideration was ease of shipment and assembly.

As he did when naming many of his inventions, Fuller combined the words dynamic, maximum, and tension to arrive at the term &quot;Dymaxion&quot;.

== History ==
The Dymaxion house was completed in 1930 after two years of development, and redesigned in 1945. Buckminster Fuller wanted to mass-produce a bathroom and a house. His first &quot;Dymaxion&quot; design was based on the design of a grain bin. During World War II, the U.S. Army commissioned Fuller to send these housing units to the Persian Gulf. In 1945, science-fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein placed an order for one to be delivered to Los Angeles, but the order was never filled.

The Siberian grain-silo house was the first system in which Fuller noted the &quot;urban dust dome&quot; effect: many installations have reported that a dome induces a local vertical heat-driven vortex that sucks cooler air downward into a dome, if the dome is vented properly—a single overhead vent, and peripheral vents. Fuller adapted the later units of the grain-silo house to use this effect.

The final design of the Dymaxion house used a central vertical stainless-steel strut on a single foundation. Structures similar to the spokes of a bicycle-wheel hung down from this supporting the roof, while beams radiating out supported the floor. Wedge-shaped fans of sheet metal aluminum formed the roof, ceiling and floor. Each structure was assembled at ground level and then winched up the strut. The Dymaxion house represented the first conscious effort to build an autonomous building in the 20th century.

It was a prototype proposed to use a packaging toilet, water storage and a convection-driven ventilator built into the roof. It was designed for the stormy areas of the world: temperate oceanic islands, and the Great Plains of North America, South America and Eurasia. In most modern houses, laundry, showers and commodes are the major water uses, with drinking, cooking and dish-washing consuming less than 20 liters per day. The Dymaxion house was intended to reduce water use by a greywater system, a packaging commode, and a &quot;fogger&quot; to replace showers. The fogger was based on efficient compressed-air and water degreasers, but with much smaller water particles to make it comfortable.

==Description ==
 Two Dymaxion houses were prototyped—one indoor (the &quot;Barwise&quot; house) and one outdoor (the &quot;Danbury&quot; house). No Dymaxion house built according to Fuller&#x27;s intentions was ever constructed and lived in. The only two prototypes of the round, aluminum house were bought by investor William Graham, together with assorted unused prototyping elements as salvage after the venture failed. In 1948, Graham constructed a hybridized version of the Dymaxion house as his family&#x27;s home; the Grahams lived there into the 1970s. Graham built the round house on his lake front property, disabling the ventilator and other interior features. It was inhabited for about 30 years, although as an extension to an existing ranch house, rather than a standalone structure as intended by Fuller. In 1990, the Graham family donated this house, and all the component prototyping parts, to the Henry Ford Museum. A painstaking process was used to conserve as many original component parts and systems as possible and restore the rest using original documentation from the Fuller prototyping process. It was installed indoors in the Henry Ford Museum in 2001 with a full exhibit.

Since there was no evidence of the crucial internal rain-gutter system, some elements of the rain collecting system were omitted from the restored exhibit. The roof was designed to wick water inside and drip into the rain-gutter and then to the cistern, rather than have a difficult-to-fit, perfectly waterproof roof.

There was to be a waterless packaging toilet that deftly shrink-wrapped the waste for pickup for later composting. During the prototyping process, the idea for the packaging toilet was quickly replaced by a conventional septic system because the packaging plastic was not available. Other features worked as advertised, notably the heating, and the passive air conditioning system, based on the &quot;dome effect&quot;.
The inhabitants of the much-modified version of the house said that the bathroom
was a particular delight. The bathroom consisted of two connected stamped copper bubbles, built as four nesting pieces. The bottom piece is fully plated in tin/antimony alloy and the top half is painted. Each bubble had a drain. No area had a radius of less than four inches (10 cm), to aid cleaning. The commode, shower, bathtub and sink were molded into the structural shell in one piece. One bubble contained a step-up ergonomic bathtub and shower, high enough to wash children without stooping, but just two steps (16 inches / 40 cm) up. The oval tub had the controls mounted on the inside left of the entrance to the oval tub. The other bubble was the bathroom proper with commode and sink. The ventilation for the bathroom was a large silent fan under the main sink, which kept odors away from people&#x27;s noses. All lighting was totally enclosed. To prevent fogging, the mirror faced into the medicine chest, which was ventilated by the fan. A plastic version of the bathroom was available intermittently until the 1980s.

The large wrap-around windows and lightweight structures were popular with the children, who crawled on the windowsill, and twanged the bicycle-wheel-style main struts.

Fuller also designed a 10-story variant which was to have been dropped in place by the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;.

==Criticism==
Criticisms of the Dymaxion house include its supposed inflexible design which completely disregarded local site and architectural idiom, and its use of energy-intensive materials such as aluminum, rather than low-energy materials, such as adobe or tile. Fuller chose aluminium for its light weight, great strength, and long-term durability, arguably factors that compensate for the initial production cost. Aluminum was also a logical choice if the homes were to be built in aircraft factories, which, since World War II had ended, had substantial excess capacity.

The Wichita House was a project Fuller accepted during World War II as an attempt to produce cost-effective dwellings for everyone. The project continued to develop the technological concept of the Dymaxion house, now incorporating a round floor plan instead of a hexagonal one. The reactions to the prototype were extraordinarily positive; nevertheless it was not produced industrially because of (re-) tooling costs. Fuller, a consummate perfectionist, felt he could improve the design and was dissatisfied with the prototype. He refused to begin production rather than allowing the &quot;unfinished&quot; design to be used.

<doc id="100510" wikidata="Q356575" url="?curid=100510" title="Charles Cros">
<text>Charles Cros or Émile-Hortensius-Charles Cros (1 October 1842 – 9 August 1888) was a French poet and inventor. He was born in Fabrezan, Aude.

Cros was a well-regarded poet and humorous writer. As an inventor, he was interested in the fields of transmitting graphics by telegraph and making photographs in color, but he is perhaps best known for being the first person to conceive a method for reproducing recorded sound, an invention he named the Paleophone.

Charles Cros died in Paris at the age of 45.

==Early life and education==
Cros was born to the philosopher Simon Charles Henry Cros (1803–1876) and Josephine Thor. He was the grandson of grammarian Antoine Cros (1769–1844).
Cros was the brother of and the painter and sculptor Henry Cros (:fr: Henry Cros) (1840–1907) and of Antoine-Hippolyte Cros (1833-1903), a surgeon who was also pretender to the throne of the defunct Kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia from 6 March 1902 until 1 November 1903, and the uncle of Laure-Therese Cros (1856-1916), who was the Queen of Araucania and Patagonia from 1 November 1903 until 12 February 1916.

In 1860 Cros began studies in medicine, but he soon abandoned them for a life of literary and scientific pursuits.

In the early 1880s, Charles Cros was a member of the Hydropathic Society and part of the fumist group led by Alphonse Allais and .

==Inventions==
===Photography===
Cros almost invented colour photography. In 1869 he published a theory of color photography in which he proposed that a single scene could be photographed through glass filters colored green, violet, and orange. The three negatives obtained through those filters could be developed to produce positive impressions that contained varying amounts of red, yellow, and blue (the &quot;antichromatic&quot; or complementary colors of the filters). The three positive impressions, when superimposed on one another (for instance, by making three carbon prints using sufficiently transparent pigments, then transferring the pigmented gelatin onto a single support sheet) would recompose the original colors of the photographed scene. Cros&#x27;s proposals, which anticipated the subtractive method of modern photography, were similar to more influential ideas advanced about the same time by Louis Ducos du Hauron. The same day, 7 May 1869, Charles Cros and Louis Ducos du Hauron presented their method of creating color photographs to the French Society of Photography. They had not been in communication beforehand and each knew nothing about the other&#x27;s research. Cros ended up conceding the invention to Ducos Du Hauron, despite having deposited a sealed paper at the French Academy of Sciences on 2 December 1867. Ducos du Hauron had patented his ideas on 28 November 1868, almost a full year later, but claimed to have written an unpublished paper on the subject in 1862.

===Phonograph===
Cros almost invented the phonograph. As far as is known, no one before him had thought of a practical way to reproduce sound from a recording of airborne sound waves. He gave the Greek name &#x27;Paleophone&#x27; (&#x27;voix du passé&#x27;, tr. &#x27;voice of the past&#x27;) to his invention. On 30 April 1877 he submitted a sealed envelope containing a letter to the Academy of Sciences in Paris explaining his proposed method. The letter stated in French, &quot;Un index léger est solidaire du centre de figure d&#x27;une membrane vibrante ; il se termine par une pointe [...] qui repose sur une surface noircie à la flamme.&quot; The English translation is one close to this: &quot;A lightweight armature is fixed to the center of the face of a vibrating membrane; it ends with a sharp point [...] which rests on a lamp-blacked surface.&quot; This surface is integral with a disc driven by a double movement of rotation and linear progression. The system is reversible: when the tip follows the furrow the membrane restores the original acoustic signal. The letter was read in public on December 3 following. In his letter, after having shown that his method consisted of detecting an oscillation of a membrane and using the tracing to reproduce the oscillation with respect to its duration and intensity, Cros added that a cylindrical form for the receiving apparatus seemed to him to be the most practical, as it allowed for the graphic inscription of the vibrations by means of a very fine-threaded screw. An article on the Paleophone was published in &quot;la semaine du Clergé&quot; on 10 October 1877, written by l&#x27;Abbé Leblanc. Cros proposed metal for both engraving tool attached to the diaphragm and receiving material for durability.

Before Cros had a chance to follow up on this idea or attempt to construct a working model, Thomas Alva Edison introduced his first working phonograph in the US. Edison used a cylinder covered in tinfoil for his first phonograph, patenting this method for reproducing sound on 15 January 1878.

===Martian communication mirror===
Cros was convinced that pinpoints of light observed on Mars and Venus, probably high clouds illuminated by the sun, were the lights of large cities on those planets. He spent years petitioning the French government to build a giant mirror that could be used to communicate with the Martians and Venusians by burning giant lines on the deserts of those planets. He was never convinced that the Martians were not a proven fact, nor that the mirror he wanted was technically impossible to build.

==Poetry==

In the early 1870s Cros was published in the short-lived weekly &quot;Renaissance littéraire et artistique&quot;, edited by Emile Blémont (:fr: Émile Blémont). Other contributors included Stéphane Mallarmé, Auguste Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam and Paul Verlaine .

His poem &quot;The Kippered Herring&quot; inspired Ernest Coquelin to create what he called &quot;monologues&quot;, short theatrical pieces whose format was copied by numerous imitators. The piece, translated as &quot;The Salt Herring&quot;, was translated and illustrated by Edward Gorey.

==Miscellaneous==
The Académie Charles Cros, the French equivalent of the US Recording Academy, is named in his honor.

Cros was a member of the group known as the hydropathes which existed around the period 1878–1881. Charles Cros, played by Christopher Chaplin, appears in the film &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;, about the lives of Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud. Cros is seen for a few seconds at the Le Chat Noir in Paris, a café which opened in 1881 and had become the home for the avant-garde art scene of the time.

Marie Corelli published one of his poems posthumously in the text of her 1890s&#x27; book, &quot;&quot;, with a special note of respect to the recently deceased author.

Cros had a love affair from 1867-1877 with Nina de Callias.

<doc id="100511" wikidata="Q639313" url="?curid=100511" title="Ardhanarishvara">
<text>Ardhanarishvara (), is a form of the Hindu deity Shiva combined with his consort Parvati. Ardhanarishvara is depicted as half-male and half-female, equally split down the middle.

Ardhanarishvara represents the synthesis of masculine and feminine energies of the universe (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of God, is inseparable from (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God, and vice versa. The union of these principles is exalted as the root and womb of all creation. Another view is that Ardhanarishvara is a symbol of Shiva&#x27;s all-pervasive nature. The right half is usually the male Shiva, illustrating his traditional attributes.

The earliest Ardhanarishvara images are dated to the Kushan period, starting from the first century CE. Its iconography evolved and was perfected in the Gupta era. The Puranas and various iconographic treatises write about the mythology and iconography of Ardhanarishvara. Ardhanarishvara remains a popular iconographic form found in most Shiva temples throughout India, though very few temples are dedicated to this deity.

==Names==
The name Ardhanarishvara means &quot;the Lord Who is half woman.&quot; Ardhanarishvara is also known by other names like Ardhanaranari (&quot;the half man-woman&quot;), Ardhanarisha (&quot;the Lord who is half woman&quot;), Ardhanarinateshvara (&quot;the Lord of Dance (Who is half-woman),
Parangada, Naranari (&quot;man-woman&quot;), Ammaiyappan (a Tamil Name meaning &quot;Mother-Father&quot;), and Ardhayuvatishvara (in Assam, &quot;the Lord whose half is a young woman or girl&quot;). The Gupta-era writer Pushpadanta in his Mahimnastava refers to this form as &quot;dehardhaghatana&quot; (&quot;Thou and She art each the half of one body&quot;). Utpala, commenting on the Brihat Samhita, calls this form Ardha-Gaurishvara (&quot;the Lord whose half is the fair one&quot;; the fair one – Gauri – is an attribute of Parvati). The Vishnudharmottara Purana simply calls this form Gaurishvara (&quot;The Lord/husband of Gauri).

==Origins and early images==
The conception of Ardhanarishvara may have been inspired by Vedic literature&#x27;s composite figure of Yama-Yami, the Vedic descriptions of the primordial Creator Vishvarupa or Prajapati and the fire-god Agni as &quot;bull who is also a cow,&quot; the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&#x27;s Atman (&quot;Self&quot;) in the form of the androgynous cosmic man Purusha and the androgynous myths of the Greek Hermaphroditus and Phrygian Agdistis. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad says that Purusha splits himself into two parts, male and female, and the two halves copulate, producing all life – a theme concurrent in Ardhanarishvara&#x27;s tales. The Shvetashvatara Upanishad sows the seed of the Puranic Ardhanarishvara. It declares Rudra – the antecedent of the Puranic Shiva – the maker of all and the root of Purusha (the male principle) and Prakriti (the female principle), adhering to Samkhya philosophy. It hints at his androgynous nature, describing him both as male and female.

The concept of Ardhanarishvara originated in Kushan and Greek cultures simultaneously; the iconography evolved in the Kushan era (30–375 CE), but was perfected in the Gupta era (320-600 CE). A mid-first century Kushan era stela in the Mathura Museum has a half-male, half-female image, along with three other figures identified with Vishnu, Gaja Lakshmi and Kubera. The male half is ithyphallic or with an &quot;urdhvalinga&quot; and makes an &quot;abhaya mudra&quot; gesture; the female left half holds a mirror and has a rounded breast. This is the earliest representation of Ardhanarishvara, universally recognized. An early Kushan Ardhanarishvara head discovered at Rajghat is displayed at the Mathura Museum. The right male half has matted hair with a skull and crescent moon; the left female half has well-combed hair decorated with flowers and wears a patra-kundala (earring). The face has a common third eye. A terracotta seal discovered in Vaishali has half-man, half-woman features. Early Kushan images show Ardhanarishvara in a simple two-armed form, but later texts and sculptures depict a more complex iconography.

Ardhanarishvara is referred to by the Greek author Stobaeus () while quoting Bardasanes (–222 AD), who learnt from an Indian embassy&#x27;s visit to Syria during the reign of Elagabalus (Antoninus of Emesa) (218–22 AD). A terracotta androgynous bust, excavated at Taxila and dated to the Saka-Parthian era, pictures a bearded man with female breasts.

Ardhanarishvara is interpreted as an attempt to syncretise the two principal Hindu sects, Shaivism and Shaktism, dedicated to Shiva and the Great Goddess. A similar syncretic image is Harihara, a composite form of Shiva and Vishnu, the Supreme deity of the Vaishnava sect.

==Iconography==

The iconographic 16th century work Shilparatna, the Matsya Purana and Agamic texts like Amshumadbhedagama, Kamikagama, Supredagama and Karanagama – most of them of South Indian origin – describe the iconography of Ardhanarishvara. The right superior side of the body usually is the male Shiva and the left is the female Parvati; in rare depictions belonging to the Shaktism school, the feminine holds the dominant right side. The icon usually is prescribed to have four, three or two arms, but rarely is depicted with eight arms. In the case of three arms, the Parvati side has only one arm, suggesting a lesser role in the icon.

===Male half===

The male half wears a &quot;jata-mukuta&quot; (a headdress formed of piled, matted hair) on his head, adorned with a crescent moon. Sometimes the &quot;jata-mukuta&quot; is adorned with serpents and the river goddess Ganga flowing through the hair. The right ear wears a &quot;nakra-kundala&quot;, &quot;sarpa-kundala&quot; (&quot;serpent-earring&quot;) or ordinary kundala (&quot;earring&quot;). Sometimes, the male eye is depicted smaller than the female one and a half-moustache is also seen. A half third eye (&quot;trinetra&quot;) is prescribed on the male side of the forehead in the canons; a full eye may also be depicted in middle of forehead separated by both the sides or a half eye may be shown above or below Parvati&#x27;s round dot. A common elliptical halo (&quot;prabhamandala&quot;/&quot;prabhavali&quot;) may be depicted behind the head; sometimes the shape of the halo may differ on either side.

In the four-armed form, a right hand holds a &quot;parashu&quot; (axe) and another makes an &quot;abhaya mudra&quot; (gesture of reassurance), or one of the right arms is slightly bent and rests on the head of Shiva&#x27;s bull mount, Nandi, while the other is held in the &quot;abhaya mudra&quot; gesture. Another configuration suggests that a right hand holds a &quot;trishula&quot; (trident) and another makes a &quot;varada mudra&quot; (gesture of blessing). Another scripture prescribes that a trishula and &quot;akshamala&quot; (rosary) are held in the two right hands. In the two-armed form, the right hand holds a kapala (skull cup) or gestures in a &quot;varada mudra&quot;. He may also hold a skull. In the Badami relief, the four-armed Ardhanarishvara plays a veena (lute), using a left and a right arm, while other male arm holds a &quot;parashu&quot; and the female one a lotus.
The Shiva half has a flat masculine chest, a straight vertical chest, broader shoulder, wider waist and muscular thigh. He wears a &quot;yagnopavita&quot; (sacred thread) across the chest, which is sometimes represented as a &quot;naga-yagnopavita&quot; (a snake worn as a &quot;yagnopavita&quot;) or a string of pearls or gems. The &quot;yajnopavita&quot; may also divide the torso into its male and female halves. He wears ornaments characteristic of Shiva&#x27;s iconography, including serpent ornaments.

In some North Indian images, the male half may be nude and also be ithyphallic (&quot;urdhavlinga&quot; or &quot;urdhavreta&quot;: with an erect phallus), however, connotes the very opposite in this context. It contextualizes &quot;seminal retention&quot; or practice of celibacy (illustration of &quot;Urdhva Retas&quot;), and represents the deity as &quot;the one who stands for complete control of the senses, and for the supreme carnal renunciation&quot;, other images found in North India include full or half phallus and one testicle. However, such imagery is never found in South Indian images; the loins are usually covered in a garment (sometimes a dhoti) of silk or cotton, or the skin of a tiger or deer), typically down to the knee, and held in place by a &quot;sarpa-mekhala&quot;, serpent girdle or jewellery. The right leg may be somewhat bent or straight and often rests on a lotus pedestal (&quot;padma-pitha&quot;). The whole right half is described as smeared with ashes and as terrible and red-coloured or gold or coral in appearance; however, these features are rarely depicted.

===Female half===
The female half has &quot;karanda-mukuta&quot; (a basket-shaped crown) on her head or well-combed knotted hair or both. The left ear wears a &quot;valika-kundala&quot; (a type of earring). A &quot;tilaka&quot; or &quot;bindu&quot; (a round red dot) adorns her forehead, matching Shiva&#x27;s third eye. The left eye is painted with black eyeliner. While the male neck is sometimes adorned with a jewelled hooded serpent, the female neck has a blue lotus matching it.

In the four-armed form, one of the left arms rests on Nandi&#x27;s head, while the other is bent in &quot;kataka mudra&quot; pose and holds a &quot;nilotpala&quot; (blue lotus) or hangs loosely at her side. In the three-armed representation, the left hand holds a flower, a mirror or a parrot. In the case of two-armed icons, the left hand rests on Nandi&#x27;s head, hangs loose or holds either a flower, a mirror or a parrot. The parrot may be also perched on Parvati&#x27;s wrist. Her hand(s) is/are adorned with ornaments like a &quot;keyura&quot; (anklet) or &quot;kankana&quot; (bangles).

Parvati has a well-developed, round bosom and a narrow feminine waist embellished with various &quot;haras&quot; (religious bracelets) and other ornaments, made of diamonds and other gems. She has a fuller thigh and a curvier body and hip than the male part of the icon. The torso, hip and pelvis of the female is exaggerated to emphasize the anatomical differences between the halves. Though the male private parts may be depicted, the female genitalia are never depicted and the loins are always draped. She wears a multi-coloured or white silken garment down to her ankle and one or three girdles around her waist. The left half wears an anklet and her foot is painted red with henna. The left leg may be somewhat bent or straight, resting on a lotus pedestal. In contrast to the Shiva half, the Parvati half – smeared with saffron – is described as calm and gentle, fair and parrot-green or dark in colour. She may be draped in a sari covering her torso and legs.

===Postures and vahana===
The posture of Ardhanarishvara may be &quot;tribhanga&quot; – bent in three parts: head (leaning to the left), torso (to the right) and right leg or in the &quot;sthanamudra&quot; position (straight), sometimes standing on a lotus pedestal, whereupon it is called &quot;samapada&quot;. Seated images of Ardhanarishvara are missing in iconographic treatises, but are still found in sculpture and painting. Though the canons often depict the Nandi bull as the common &quot;vahana&quot; (mount) of Ardhanarishvara, some depictions have Shiva&#x27;s bull &quot;vahana&quot; seated or standing near or behind his foot, while the goddess&#x27;s lion &quot;vahana&quot; is near her foot.

===Eight-armed form===

The Parashurameshvara Temple at Bhubaneswar has a dancing eight-armed Ardhanarishvara. The upper male arms hold a lute and &quot;akshamala&quot; (rosary), while the upper female ones hold a mirror and a book; the others are broken. Another non-conventional Ardhanarishvara is found at Darasuram. The sculpture is three-headed and eight-armed, holding &quot;akshamala&quot;, &quot;khadga&quot; (sword), &quot;pasha&quot;, &quot;musala&quot;, &quot;kapala&quot; (skull cup), lotus and other objects.

===Other textual descriptions===

The Naradiya Purana mentions that Ardhanarishvara is half-black and half-yellow, nude on one side and clothed on other, wearing skulls and a garland of lotuses on the male half and female half respectively. The Linga Purana gives a brief description of Ardhanarishvara as making &quot;varada&quot; and &quot;abhaya mudras&quot; and holding a &quot;trishula&quot; and a lotus. The Vishnudharmottara Purana prescribes a four-armed form, with right hands holding a rosary and &quot;trishula&quot;, while the left ones bear a mirror and a lotus. The form is called &quot;Gaurishvara&quot; in this text.

==Legends==
The mythology of Ardhanarishvara – which mainly originates in the Puranic canons – was developed later to explain existent images of the deity that had emerged in the Kushan era.

The unnamed half-female form of Shiva is also alluded to in the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. In Book XIII, Upamanyu praises Shiva rhetorically asking if there is anyone else whose half-body is shared by his spouse, and adds that the universe had risen from the union of sexes, as represented by Shiva&#x27;s half-female form. In some narratives, Shiva is described as dark and fair-complexioned, half yellow and half white, half woman and half man, and both woman and man. In Book XIII, Shiva preaches to Parvati that half of his body is made up of her body.

In the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, Parvati requests Shiva to allow her to reside with him, embracing &quot;limb-to-limb&quot;, and so Ardhanarishvara is formed. It also tells that when the demon Andhaka wanted to seize Parvati and make her his wife, Vishnu rescued her and brought her to his abode. When the demon followed her there, Parvati revealed her Ardhanarishvara form to him. Seeing the half-male, half-female form, the demon lost interest in her and left. Vishnu was amazed to see this form and saw himself in the female part of the form.

The &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; describes that the creator god Brahma created all male beings, the Prajapatis, and told them to regenerate, which they were unable to do. Confronted with the resulting decline in the pace of creation, Brahma was perplexed and contemplated on Shiva for help. To enlighten Brahma of his folly, Shiva appeared before him as Ardhanarishvara. Brahma prayed to the female half of Shiva to give him a female to continue creation. The goddess agreed and created various female powers from her body, thereby allowing creation to progress. In other Puranas like the Linga Purana, Vayu Purana, Vishnu Purana, Skanda Purana, Kurma Purana, and Markandeya Purana, Rudra (identified with Shiva) appears as Ardhanarishvara, emerging from Brahma&#x27;s head, forehead, mouth or soul as the embodiment of Brahma&#x27;s fury and frustration due to the slow pace of creation. Brahma asks Rudra to divide himself, and the latter complies by dividing into male and female. Numerous beings, including the 11 Rudras and various female shaktis, are created from both the halves. In some versions, the goddess unites with Shiva again and promises to be born as Sati on earth to be Shiva&#x27;s wife. In the Linga Purana, the Ardhanarishvara Rudra is so hot that in the process of appearing from Brahma&#x27;s forehead, he burns Brahma himself. Ardhanarishvara Shiva then enjoys his own half – the Great Goddess – by &quot;the path of yoga&quot; and creates Brahma and Vishnu from her body. In the repetitive cycle of aeons, Ardhanarishvara is ordained to reappear at the beginning of every creation as in the past.

The Matsya Purana describes how Brahma, pleased with a penance performed by Parvati, rewards her by blessing her with a golden complexion. This renders her more attractive to Shiva, to whom she later merges as one half of his body.

Tamil temple lore narrates that once the gods and sages (&quot;rishi&quot;) had gathered at Shiva&#x27;s abode, they prayed their respects to Shiva and Parvati. However, the sage Bhringi had vowed to worship only one deity, Shiva, and ignored Parvati while worshipping and circumambulating him. Agitated, Parvati cursed Bhringi to lose all his flesh and blood, reducing him to a skeleton. In this form Bhringi could not stand erect, so the compassionate ones who witnessed the scene blessed the sage with a third leg for support. As her attempt to humiliate the sage had failed, Parvati punished herself with austerities that pleased Shiva and led him to grant her the boon of uniting with him, thereby compelling Bhringi to worship her as well as himself in the form of Ardhanarishvara. However, the sage assumed the form of a beetle and circumambulating only the male half, drilling a hole in the deity. Amazed by his devotion, Parvati reconciled with the sage and blessed him. The seventh-century Shaiva Nayanar saint Appar mentions that after marrying Parvati, Shiva incorporated her into half of his body.

In the Kalika Purana, Parvati (called Gauri here) is described as having suspected Shiva of infidelity when she saw her own reflection in the crystal-like breast of Shiva. A conjugal dispute erupted but was quickly resolved, after which Parvati wished to stay eternally with Shiva in his body. The divine couple was thereafter fused as Ardhanarishvara. Another tale from North India also talks about Parvati&#x27;s jealousy. Another woman, the river Ganga – often depicted flowing out of Shiva&#x27;s locks – sat on his head, while Parvati (as Gauri) sat on his lap. To pacify Gauri, Shiva united with her as Ardhanarishvara.

Only in tales associated with the hindu sect of Shakta (in which the Goddess is considered the Supreme Being) is the Goddess venerated as the Maker of All. In these tales, it is her body (not Shiva&#x27;s) which splits into male and female halves.

==Symbolism==

Ardhanarishvara symbolizes that the male and female principles are inseparable. The composite form conveys the unity of opposites (&quot;coniunctio oppositorum&quot;) in the universe. The male half of Ardhanarishvara stands for Purusha and female half is Prakriti. Purusha is the male principle and passive force of the universe, while Prakriti is the female active force; both are &quot;constantly drawn to embrace and fuse with each other, though... separated by the intervening axis&quot;. The union of Purusha (Shiva) and Prikriti (Shiva&#x27;s energy, Shakti) generates the universe, an idea also manifested in the union of the Linga of Shiva and Yoni of Devi creating the cosmos. The Mahabharata lauds this form as the source of creation. Ardhanarishvara also suggests the element of Kama or Lust, which leads to creation.

Ardhanarishvara signifies &quot;totality that lies beyond duality&quot;, &quot;bi-unity of male and female in God&quot; and &quot;the bisexuality and therefore the non-duality&quot; of the Supreme Being. It conveys that God is both Shiva and Parvati, &quot;both male and female, both father and mother, both aloof and active, both fearsome and gentle, both destructive and constructive&quot; and unifies all other dichotomies of the universe. While Shiva&#x27;s rosary in the Ardhanarishvara iconography associates him with asceticism and spirituality, Parvati&#x27;s mirror associates her to the material illusory world. Ardhanarishvara reconciles and harmonizes the two conflicting ways of life: the spiritual way of the ascetic as represented by Shiva, and the materialistic way of the householder as symbolized by Parvati, who invites the ascetic Shiva into marriage and the wider circle of worldly affairs. The interdependence of Shiva on his power (&quot;Shakti&quot;) as embodied in Parvati is also manifested in this form. Ardhanarishvara conveys that Shiva and Shakti are one and the same, an interpretation also declared in inscriptions found along with Ardhanarishvara images in Java and the eastern Malay Archipelago. The Vishnudharmottara Purana also emphasizes the identity and sameness of the male Purusha and female Prakriti, manifested in the image of Ardhanarishvara. According to Shaiva guru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami (1927–2001), Ardhanarishvara signifies that the great Shiva is &quot;All, inseparable from His energy&quot; (i.e. his &quot;Shakti&quot;) and is beyond gender.
Across cultures, hermaphrodite figures like Ardhanarishvara have traditionally been associated with fertility and abundant growth. In this form, Shiva in his eternal embrace with Prakriti represents the eternal reproductive power of Nature, whom he regenerates after she loses her fertility. &quot;It is a duality in unity, the underlying principle being a sexual dualism&quot;. Art historian Sivaramamurti calls it &quot;a unique connection of the closely knit ideal of man and woman rising above the craving of the flesh and serving as a symbol of hospitality and parenthood&quot;. The dual unity of Ardhanarishvara is considered &quot;a model of conjugal inseparability&quot;. Padma Upadhyaya comments, &quot;The idea of ... Ardhanārīśvara is to locate the man in the woman as also the woman in the man and to create perfect homogeneity in domestic affairs&quot;.

Often, the right half of Ardhanarishvara is male and the left is female. The left side is the location of the heart and is associated with &#x27;feminine&#x27; characteristics like intuition and creativity, while the right is associated with the brain and &#x27;masculine&#x27; traits – logic, valour and systematic thought. The female is often not equal in the Ardhanarishvara, the male god who is half female; she remains a dependent entity. Ardhanarishvara &quot;is in essence Shiva, not Parvati&quot;. This is also reflected in mythology, where Parvati becomes a part of Shiva. It is likewise reflected in iconography: Shiva often has two supernatural arms and Parvati has just one earthly arm, and his bull &quot;vahana&quot; – not her lion vahana – typically accompanies them.

==Worship==
Ardhanarishvara is one of the most popular iconographic forms of Shiva. It is found in more or less all temples and shrines dedicated to Shiva all over India and South-east Asia. There is ample evidence from texts and the multiple depictions of the Ardhanarishvara in stone to suggest that a cult centred around the deity may have existed. The cult may have had occasional followers, but was never aligned to any sect. This cult focusing on the joint worship of Shiva and the Goddess may even have had a high position in Hinduism, but when and how it faded away remains a mystery. Though a popular iconographic form, temples dedicated to the deity are few. A popular one is located in Thiruchengode, while five others are located in Kallakkurichi taluk, all of them in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

The &quot;Linga Purana&quot; advocates the worship of Ardhanarishvara by devotees to attain union with Shiva upon dissolution of the world and thus attain salvation. The &quot;Ardhanarinateshvara Stotra&quot; composed by Adi Shankaracharya is a popular hymn dedicated to the deity. The Nayanar saints of Tamil Nadu exault the deity in hymns. While the 8th-century Nayanar saint Sundarar says that Shiva is always inseparable from the Mother Goddess, another 7th-century Nayanar saint Sambandar describes how the &quot;eternal feminine&quot; is not only his consort, but she is also part of him. The renowned Sanskrit writer Kalidasa (c. 4th–5th century) alludes Ardhanarishvara in invocations of his Raghuvamsa and Malavikagnimitram, and says that Shiva and Shakti are as inseparable as word and meaning. The 9th-century Nayanar saint Manikkavacakar casts Parvati in the role of the supreme devotee of Shiva in his hymns. He alludes to Ardhanarishvara several times and regards it the ultimate goal of a devotee to be united with Shiva as Parvati is in the Ardhanarishvara form.

<text>Sir Carl Wilhelm Siemens (4 April 1823 – 19 November 1883), anglicised to Charles William Siemens, was a German-British electrical engineer and businessman.

==Biography==
Siemens was born in the village of Lenthe, today part of Gehrden, near Hanover where his father, Christian Ferdinand Siemens (31 July 1787 – 16 January 1840), a tenant farmer, farmed an estate belonging to the Crown. The Siemens family is an old family of Goslar which has been documented since 1384. His mother was Eleonore Deichmann (1792–8 July 1839), and William, or Carl Wilhelm, was the fourth son of a family of fourteen children. Of his siblings, Ernst Werner Siemens, the fourth child, became a famous electrician and was associated with William in many of his inventions. He was also the brother of Carl Heinrich von Siemens and a cousin of Alexander Siemens.

On 23 July 1859, Siemens was married at St James&#x27;s, Paddington, to Anne Gordon—the youngest daughter of Joseph Gordon, Writer to the Signet, Edinburgh, and sister of Lewis Gordon, Professor of Engineering in the University of Glasgow—and became a naturalised British citizen. He used to say that on 19 March of that year he took oath and allegiance to two ladies in one day—to The Queen and to his betrothed. He was knighted—becoming Sir William—a few months before his death. He died on the evening of Monday 19 November 1883 and was buried one week later in Kensal Green Cemetery, London. A glass window installed in Westminster Abbey in his honour commemorated him. Lady Siemens died in 1902.

==The early years==
In the autumn of 1838 when William was fifteen years old, he began his studies to become an engineer. He attended a highly respected School of Trade and Commerce, the &quot;Gewerbe-Schule Magdeburg&quot;. William had a particularly close relationship with his eldest brother; Ernst Werner Siemens had decided to teach William mathematics so that he could learn English at school instead. This programme helped them both and William&#x27;s knowledge of English proved an incalculable advantage to them both. He went on to pass his examination easily. Less than a year later, their mother died and their father soon afterwards in 1840.

Once William had completed his course at the Magdeburg school he went on to the University of Göttingen where he attended lectures on physical geography and technology, high mathematics, theoretical chemistry and practical chemistry and physics. He was also able for a short time to work with Wilhelm Weber, the renowned scientist and inventor, in his Magnetic Observatory.

William was nearly nineteen when he left university to become an apprentice engineer. He also found time for more artistic pursuits such as taking dancing lessons and even painting a landscape of Nordhausen for the wife of the factory manager. His progress in the engineering factory was so rapid that his two-year apprenticeship was cut down to one.

Due to the education of the younger members of the family becoming a financial worry, on 10 March 1843, Carl Wilhelm Siemens left for London. He was acting as an agent for his brother Werner, and he hoped to earn enough money by selling a patent in England to help support and educate his many brothers and sisters. He felt a keen desire to see England and the journey cost him £1. William had already shown himself to be an enthusiastic businessman, having financed his trip by selling an invention of his brother&#x27;s, an improvement to the gold and silver plating process, to George Richards Elkington. He was well aware, as he wrote to Werner, that his visit might achieve nothing, but if all went well he intended to remain. This indeed proved to be the case.

==Career==
Siemens had been trained as a mechanical engineer, and his most important work at this early stage was non-electrical; the greatest achievement of his life, the regenerative furnace. Though in 1847 he published a paper in Liebig&#x27;s &quot;Annalen der Chemie&quot; on the &#x27;Mercaptan of Selenium,&#x27; his mind was busy with the new ideas upon the nature of heat which were promulgated by Carnot, Clapeyron, Joule, Clausius, Mayer, Thomson, and Rankine. He discarded the older notions of heat as a substance, and accepted it as a form of energy. Working on this new line of thought, which gave him an advantage over other inventors of his time, he made his first attempt to economise heat, by constructing, in 1847, at the factory of John Hick, of Bolton, an engine of four horse-power, having a condenser provided with regenerators, and using superheated steam.

Two years later he continued his experiments at the works of Messrs. Fox, Henderson, and Co., of Smethwick, near Birmingham, who had taken the matter in hand. The use of superheated steam was attended with many practical difficulties, and the invention was not entirely successful; nevertheless, the Society of Arts, in 1850, acknowledged the value of the principle, by awarding Siemens a gold medal for his regenerative condenser.

In 1850 he established the London sales office of Siemens &amp; Halske, the engineering company producing telegraphs, which his brother Werner had founded in 1847 at Berlin. He started selling such devices to the wire rope producer R. S. Newall and Company in Dundee, of which his friend (and uncle of his later wife) Lewis Gordon was the co-owner. Newall &amp; Co. also outsourced test jobs for cables to Siemens and such enabled the new company to enter the ocean cable-laying business. The branch office became Siemens Brothers in 1858. In the 1850s, the company was involved in building long distance telegraph networks in Russia. In 1855, a company branch headed by another brother, Carl Heinrich von Siemens, opened in St Petersburg, Russia. By 1863, Sir William had his own cable factory built at Charlton, London. In 1867, Siemens completed the monumental Indo-European (Calcutta to London) telegraph line.

In 1859 William Siemens devoted a great part of his time to electrical invention and research; and the number of telegraph apparatus of all sorts – telegraph cables, land lines, and their accessories – which have emanated from the Siemens Telegraph Works (at Charlton, SE London) has been remarkable. In 1872 Sir William Siemens became the first President of the Society of Telegraph Engineers which became the Institution of Electrical Engineers, the forerunner of the Institution of Engineering and Technology 
In 1860 William Siemens constructed a remarkable gas engine (the same year the very first commercial engine was produced by Lenoir). It did not get beyond the experimental stage, though its principle of operation (described in Siemens British patent 2074 of 1860, and by Siemens in &quot;The Theory of the Gas Engine&quot;) appears to be similar to the commercially successful Brayton engine of 1872. In the discussion section of &quot;The Theory of the Gas Engine&quot; Siemens discloses thatThe engine promised to give very good results, but about the same time he began to give his attention to the production of intense heat in furnaces, and having to make his choice between the two subjects, he selected the furnace and the metallurgic process leading out of it; and that was why the engine had remained where it was for so long a time.

Siemens was also responsible for the hot tube ignition system used on many of the early gas engines.

In June 1862 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1871 delivered their Bakerian Lecture.

As a member of the circumnavigation committee preparing the oceanographic expedition of HMS &quot;Challenger&quot;, Siemens was commissioned in 1871 to develop an electric thermometer to measure the temperature of the ocean at different depths.

He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1877.

The regenerative furnace is the greatest single invention of Charles William Siemens, using a process known as the Siemens-Martin process. The electric pyrometer, which is perhaps the most elegant and original of all William Siemens&#x27;s inventions, is also the link which connects his electrical with his metallurgical researches. Siemens pursued two major themes in his inventive efforts, one based upon the science of heat, the other based upon the science of electricity; and the electric thermometer was, as it were, a delicate cross-coupling which connected both.
In 1874 he had a special cable ship built, according to his design, for &quot;Siemens Brothers&quot;, the CS &quot;Faraday&quot;. In 1881, a Siemens AC Alternator driven by a watermill was used to power the world&#x27;s first electric street lighting in the town of Godalming, United Kingdom.

<text>The Guardians of the Directions (, ) are the deities who rule the specific directions of space according to Hinduism, Jainism and &quot;&quot; Buddhism—especially . As a group of eight deities, they are called &#x27; (अष्ट-दिक्पाल), literally meaning guardians of eight directions. They are often augmented with two extra deities for the ten directions (the two extra directions being zenith and nadir), when they are known as the &#x27;. In Hinduism it is traditional to represent their images on the walls and ceilings of Hindu temples. They are also often portrayed in Jain temples, with the exception that Nāga usually takes the place of Vishnu in the nadir. Ancient Java and Bali Hinduism recognize , literally meaning guardians of nine directions, that consist of eight directions with one addition in the center. The nine guardian gods of directions is called &quot;Dewata Nawa Sanga&quot; (Nine guardian devata). The diagram of these guardian gods of directions is featured in Surya Majapahit, the emblem of Majapahit empire.

There are strong similarities between the concept of the guardians of the directions and the lore surrounding the Chinese four symbols, four ancestral spirits who are responsible for four of the cardinal directions (North, South, East, and West).

==Directions in Hindu tradition==
Directions in Hindu tradition are called as &quot;&quot;, or &quot;Dik&quot;. There are four cardinal directions, six orthogonal directions and a total of ten directions, however infinite combinations are possible.
==Lokapālas==
In Hinduism, the guardians of the cardinal directions are called the s (लोकपाल), or Dikpalaka. Three main distinctions of Dikpalaka are recognized, being:
=== (&quot;Guardians of Eight Directions&quot;)===
=== (&quot;Guardians of Ten Directions&quot;)===
Besides the eight guardians, the following are added:
* Brahma (Zenith, meaning &quot;the farthest up from the gravitational force&quot;)
* Vishnu (Nadir, meaning &quot;the direction in which gravity pulls&quot;)

=== (&quot;Guardians of Nine Directions&quot;)===
(Called &quot;Devata Nawa Sanga&quot; in ancient Java and Bali Hinduism)

* Shiva (Center)
* Vishnu (North)
* Brahma (South)
* Isvara (East)
* Mahadeva (West)
* Sambhu (Northeast)
* Mahesora (Southeast)
* Sangkara (Northwest)
* Rudra (Southwest)

<doc id="100521" wikidata="Q1329361" url="?curid=100521" title="Fleeming Jenkin">
<text>Henry Charles Fleeming Jenkin FRS FRSE LLD (; 25 March 1833 – 12 June 1885) was Regius Professor of Engineering at the University of Edinburgh, remarkable for his versatility. Known to the world as the inventor of the cable car or telpherage, he was an electrician and cable engineer, economist, lecturer, linguist, critic, actor, dramatist and artist. His descendants include the engineer Charles Frewen Jenkin and through him the Conservative MPs Patrick, Lord Jenkin of Roding and Bernard Jenkin.

==Early life==
===Background and childhood===
Generally called Fleeming Jenkin, after Admiral Fleeming, one of his father&#x27;s patrons, he was born to an old and eccentric family in a government building near Dungeness, Kent, England, his father, Captain Charles Jenkin, at that time being in the coast-guard service. His mother, Henrietta Camilla (Cora) Jenkin (born Jackson) was a published author. His mother was responsible for Fleeming&#x27;s education. She took him to the south of Scotland, where, chiefly at Barjarg, she taught him drawing and allowed him to ride his pony on the moors. He went to school at Jedburgh, Borders, and afterwards to the Edinburgh Academy, where he won many prizes. Among his school fellows were James Clerk Maxwell and Peter Guthrie Tait.

On his father&#x27;s retirement in 1847, the family moved to Frankfurt, partly from motives of economy and partly for the boy&#x27;s education. Here Jenkin and his father spent a pleasant time together, sketching old castles, and observing the customs of the peasantry. At thirteen, Jenkin had produced a romance of three hundred lines in heroic couplets, a novel, and innumerable poems, none of which are now extant. He learned German in Frankfurt and, on the family migrating to Paris the following year, he studied French and mathematics under a M. Deluc. While there, Jenkin witnessed the outbreak of the Revolution of 1848 and heard the first shot, describing the action in .

The Jenkins left Paris, and went to Genoa, where they experienced another revolution, and Mrs. Jenkin, with her son and sister-in-law, had to seek the protection of a British vessel in the harbour, leaving their house stored with the property of their friends, and guarded by Captain Jenkin. At Genoa, Jenkin attended the university, being its first Protestant student. Father Bancalari, the professor of natural philosophy, lectured on electromagnetism, his physical laboratory being the best in Italy. Jenkin took the degree of M.A. with first-class honours, his special subject having been electromagnetism. The questions in the examinations were in Latin, and had to be answered in Italian. Fleeming also attended an art school in the city, and gained a silver medal for a drawing from one of Raphael&#x27;s cartoons. His holidays were spent in sketching, and his evenings in learning to play the piano or, when permissible, at the theatre or opera-house. He had conceived a taste for acting. He attended the University of Edinburgh in 1851.

===Training as engineer and artist===
In 1850, Jenkin spent some time in a Genoese locomotive shop under Philip Taylor of Marseille but on the death of his Aunt Anna, who lived with them, Captain Jenkin took his family back to England, and settled in Manchester, where the young man, in 1851, was apprenticed to mechanical engineering at the works of William Fairbairn, and from half-past eight in the morning until six at night had, as he says, &quot;to file and chip vigorously, in a moleskin suit, and infernally dirty.

&quot;At home he pursued his studies, and was for a time engaged with Dr. Bell in working out a geometrical method of arriving at the proportions of Ancient Greek architecture. His stay in Manchester, though in striking contrast to his life in Genoa, was agreeable. He liked his work, had the good spirits of youth, and made some pleasant friends, one of them the author, Elizabeth Gaskell. He was argumentative, and his mother tells of his having overcome a consul at Genoa in a political discussion when he was only sixteen &#x27;simply from being well-informed on the subject, and honest. He is as true as steel,&#x27; she writes, &#x27;and for no one will he bend right or left... Do not fancy him a Bobadil; he is only a very true, candid boy. I am so glad he remains in all respects but information a great child.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;On leaving Fairbairn&#x27;s he was engaged for a time on a survey for the proposed Lukmanier Railway in Switzerland, and in 1856 he entered Penn&#x27;s engineering works at Greenwich as a draughtsman, being occupied on the plans of a vessel designed for the Crimean War. He complained about the late hours, his rough comrades, and his humble lodgings, &#x27;across a dirty green and through some half-built streets of two-storied houses... Luckily, he adds, &#x27;I am fond of my profession, or I could not stand this life.&#x27; Jenkin had been his mother&#x27;s pet until then, and felt the change from home more keenly for that reason. At night he read engineering and mathematics, or Thomas Carlyle and the poets, and cheered his drooping spirits with frequent trips to London to see his mother.&quot;

&quot;Another social pleasure was his visits to the house of Alfred Austin, a barrister, who became permanent secretary to Her Majesty&#x27;s Office of Works and Public Buildings, and retired in 1868 with the title of CB. His wife, Eliza Barron, was the youngest daughter of a gentleman of Norwich who, when a child, had been patted on the head, in his father&#x27;s shop, by Dr Samuel Johnson, while canvassing for Mr. Thrale. Jenkin had been introduced to the Austins by a letter from Mrs. Gaskell, and was charmed with the atmosphere of their choice home, where intellectual conversation was happily united with kind and courteous manners, without any pretence or affectation. &quot;Each of the Austins,&quot; says Stevenson in his memoir of Jenkin, &quot;was full of high spirits; each practised something of the same repression; no sharp word was uttered in the house.&quot; The Austins were truly hospitable and cultured, not merely so in form and appearance. It was a rare privilege and preservative for a solitary young man in Jenkin&#x27;s position to have the entry into such elevating society and he appreciated his good fortune.&quot;

&quot;Annie Austin, their only child, had been highly educated and knew Greek among other things. Though Jenkin loved and admired her parents he did not at first care for Annie. Stevenson hints that she vanquished him by correcting a &quot;false quantity&quot; of his one day; he was the man to reflect over a correction, and &quot;admire the castigator.&quot; Jenkin was poor but the liking of her parents for him gave him hope. He had entered the service of Messrs. Liddell and Gordon who were engaged in the new work of submarine telegraphy, which satisfied his aspirations, and promised him a successful career. He therefore asked the Austins for leave to court their daughter. Mrs. Austin consented freely, and Mr. Austin only reserved the right to inquire into his character. Jenkin, overcome by their disinterestedness, exclaimed in one of his letters &quot;Are these people the same as other people?&quot; Miss Austin seems to have resented his courtship of her parents first but the mother&#x27;s favour and his own spirited behaviour saved him and won her consent.&quot;

After leaving Penn&#x27;s, Jenkin became a railroad engineer under Liddell and Gordon, and, in 1857, became engineer to R.S. Newall and Company of Gateshead who shared the work of making the first Atlantic cable with Glass, Elliott &amp; Co. of Greenwich. Jenkin was busy designing and fitting up machinery for cableships, and making electrical experiments. &quot;I am half crazy with work,&quot; he wrote to his fiancée; &quot;I like it though: it&#x27;s like a good ball, the excitement carries you through.&quot; He wrote, &quot;My profession gives me all the excitement and interest I ever hope for...I am at the works till ten, and sometimes till eleven. But I have a nice office to sit in, with a fire to myself, and bright brass scientific instruments all round me, and books to read, and experiments to make, and enjoy myself amazingly. I find the study of electricity so entertaining that I am apt to neglect my other work... What shall I compare them to,&quot; he writes of some electrical experiments, &quot;a new song? or a Greek play?&quot;

==Cable-laying on the &quot;Elba&quot;==

===First voyage===
In the spring of 1855, he was fitting out the &quot;S.S. Elba&quot; at Birkenhead for his first telegraph cruise. Earlier in 1855, John Watkins Brett had attempted to lay a cable across the Mediterranean between Cape Spartivento, in the south of Sardinia, and a point near Bona, on the coast of Algeria. It was a gutta-percha cable of six wires or conductors, manufactured by Glass, Elliott &amp; Co., a firm which afterwards combined with the Gutta-Percha Company and became the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company. Brett laid the cable from the &quot;Result&quot;, a sailing ship in tow, instead of a more manageable steamer. Meeting with 600 fathoms (1100 m) of water when twenty-five miles (45 km) from land, the cable ran out so fast that a tangled skein came up out of the hold and the line had to be severed. Having only on board to span the whole distance of , he grappled the lost cable near the shore, raised it, and &quot;under-ran&quot; or passed it over the ship, for some , then cut it, leaving the seaward end on the bottom. He then spliced the ship&#x27;s cable to the shoreward end and resumed paying-out but after in all were laid, another rapid rush of cable took place, and Brett was obliged to cut and abandon the line.

Another attempt was made the following year, but with no better success. Brett then tried to lay a three-wire cable from the steamer &quot;Dutchman;&quot; but owing to the deep water (in some places 1500 fathoms or 2700 m) when he came to a few miles from Galita, his destination on the Algerian coast, he had not enough cable to reach the land. He telegraphed to London for more cable to be made and sent out, while the ship remained there holding the end. After five days the cable parted, perhaps as a result of rubbing on the bottom.

It was to recover the lost cable of these expeditions that the &quot;Elba&quot; was got ready for sea. Jenkin had fitted her out the year before for laying the Cagliari to Malta and Corfu cables but on this occasion she was better equipped. She had a new machine for picking up the cable, and a sheave or pulley at the bows for it to run over, both designed by Jenkin, together with a variety of wooden buoys, ropes, and chains. Liddell, assisted by F. C. Webb and Fleeming Jenkin, was in charge of the expedition. Jenkin had nothing to do with the electrical work, his care being the deck machinery for raising the cable but it was a responsible job. He reported the expedition in letters to Miss Austin and in diary entries.

During the latter part of the work much of the cable was found to be looped and twisted into &#x27;kinks&#x27; from having been so slackly laid and two immense tangled skeins were raised on board, one by means of the mast-head and fore-yard tackle. Photographs of this raveled cable were exhibited as a curiosity in the windows of Newall &amp; Co.&#x27;s shop in The Strand. By 5 July the whole of the six-wire cable had been recovered and a portion of the three-wire cable, the rest being abandoned as unfit for use, owing to its twisted condition. On the evening of the 2nd the first mate, while on the water unshackling a buoy, was struck in the back by a fluke of the ship&#x27;s anchor as she drifted, and so severely injured that he lay for many weeks at Cagliari. Jenkin&#x27;s knowledge of languages made him useful as an interpreter but, in mentioning this incident to Miss Austin, he writes, &quot;For no fortune would I be a doctor to witness these scenes continually. Pain is a terrible thing.&quot;

===Future partners===
&quot;Early in 1859 he met William Thomson (later Sir William Thomson, and still later Lord Kelvin), his future friend and partner. Lewis Gordon, of Newall &amp; Co., subsequently the first professor of engineering in a British University, was in Glasgow seeing Thomson&#x27;s instruments for testing and signalling on the first Atlantic cable during the six weeks of its working. Gordon said he should like to show them to &quot;a young man of remarkable ability,&quot; engaged at their Birkenhead works. Jenkin was telegraphed for, arrived next morning, and spent a week in Glasgow, mostly in Thomson&#x27;s classroom and laboratory at the old college. Thomson was struck with Jenkin&#x27;s brightness, ability, thoroughness and determination to learn. &quot;I soon found,&#x27; he remarked, &#x27;that thoroughness of honesty was as strongly engrained in the scientific as in the moral side of his character.&quot; Their talk was chiefly on the electric telegraph but Jenkin was eager, too, on the subject of physics. After staying a week he returned to the factory but he began experiments and corresponded briskly with Thomson about cable work. Thomson seems to have infected his visitor during their brief contact with the magnetic force of his personality and enthusiasm.&quot;

On 26 February, during a four days&#x27; leave, Jenkin married Miss Austin at Northiam in Sussex, returning to his work the following Tuesday. He was strongly attached to his wife and his letters reveal a warmth of affection which a casual observer would never have suspected in him. In 1869 he wrote, &quot;People may write novels, and other people may write poems, but not a man or woman among them can say how happy a man can be who is desperately in love with his wife after ten years of marriage.&quot; Five weeks before his death he wrote to her, &quot;Your first letter from Bournemouth gives me heavenly pleasure – for which I thank Heaven and you, too, who are my heaven on earth.&quot;

===Second voyage===
During the summer he took another telegraph cruise in the Mediterranean. This time the &quot;Elba&quot; was to lay a cable from the Greek islands of Syros and Crete to Egypt. He again reported in letters to his wife.

==Entrepreneur and academic==

===Partnership with Forde===
&quot;In 1861, Jenkin left the service of Newall &amp; Co. and entered into partnership with H. C. Forde, who had acted as engineer under the British Government for the Malta-Alexandria cable, and was now practising as a civil engineer. For several years, business was bad.&quot;

===Domestic life===
In 1859 he married Ann Austin.

With a young family coming, it was an anxious time but he bore his troubles lightly. Robert Louis Stevenson says in his &quot;memoir&quot; of Jenkin that it was his principle &quot;to enjoy each day&#x27;s happiness as it arises, like birds and children.&quot;

In 1863 his first son was born and the family moved to a cottage at Claygate near Esher. Though ill and poor, he kept up his self-confidence. &quot;The country,&quot; he wrote to his wife, &quot;will give us, please God, health and strength. I will love and cherish you more than ever. You shall go where you wish, you shall receive whom you wish, and as for money, you shall have that too. I cannot be mistaken. I have now measured myself with many men. I do not feel weak. I do not feel that I shall fail. In many things I have succeeded, and I will in this... And meanwhile, the time of waiting, which, please Heaven, shall not be so long, shall also not be so bitter. Well, well, I promise much, and do not know at this moment how you and the dear child are. If he is but better, courage, my girl, for I see light.&quot;

He took to gardening, without a natural liking for it, and soon became an ardent expert. He wrote reviews and lectured or amused himself in playing charades and reading poetry. James Clerk Maxwell was among his visitors. During October 1860, he superintended the repairs of the Bona-Spartivento cable, revisiting Chia and Cagliari, then full of Garibaldi&#x27;s troops. The
cable, which had been broken by the anchors of coral fishers, was grapnelled with difficulty. &quot;What rocks we did hook!&quot; writes Jenkin. &quot;No sooner was the grapnel down than the ship was anchored; and then came such a business: ship&#x27;s engines going, deck engine thundering, belt slipping, tear of breaking ropes; actually breaking grapnels. It was always an hour or more before we could get the grapnels down again.&quot;

In 1865, on the birth of their second son, Mrs. Jenkin was very ill, and Jenkin, after running two miles for a doctor, knelt by her bedside during the night in a draught. He suffered from rheumatism and sciatica ever afterwards. It nearly disabled him while laying the cable from Lowestoft to Norderney in Germany for Paul Reuter in 1866. This line was designed by Forde &amp; Jenkin, manufactured by Messrs. W. T. Henley &amp; Co., and laid by the &quot;Caroline&quot; and &quot;William Cory&quot;. Clara Volkman, a niece of Reuter, sent the first message, with the telegraph engineer C. F. Varley holding her hand.

===Professor at London and Edinburgh===
&quot;In 1866, Jenkin was appointed as professor (chair) of engineering at University College London. Two years later his prospects suddenly
improved. The partnership began to pay and he was selected to fill the newly established Regius Chair of Engineering at Edinburgh University. He wrote to his wife: &#x27;With you in the garden (at Claygate), with Austin in the coach-house, with pretty songs in the little low white room, with the moonlight in the dear room upstairs—ah! it was perfect; but the long walk, wondering, pondering, fearing, scheming, and the dusty jolting railway, and the horrid fusty office, with its endless disappointments, they are well gone. It is well enough to fight, and scheme, and bustle about in the eager crowd here (in London) for a while now and then; but not for a lifetime. What I have now is just perfect. Study for winter, action for summer, lovely country for recreation, a pleasant town for talk.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;The following June he was on board the &quot;Great Eastern&quot; while she laid the French Atlantic cable from Brest to Saint-Pierre. Among his shipmates were Sir William Thomson, Sir James Anderson, C. F. Varley, Latimer Clark and Willoughby Smith. Jenkin&#x27;s sketches of Clark and Varley are remarkable. At Saint-Pierre they arrived in a fog which lifted to show their consort, the &quot;William Cory&quot;, straight ahead, and the &quot;Gulnare&quot; signalling a welcome. Jenkin observed that the whole island was electrified by the battery at the telegraph station.&quot;

===Partnership with Thomson and Varley===
&quot;Jenkin&#x27;s position at Edinburgh led to a partnership in cable work with Varley and Thomson, whom he always admired. Jenkin&#x27;s practical and businesslike abilities were of assistance to Thomson, relieving him of routine and sparing his time for other work. In 1870 the siphon recorder for tracing a cablegram in ink instead of merely flashing it by the moving ray of the mirror galvanometer, was introduced on long cables and became a source of profit to Jenkin and Varley as well as to Thomson, its inventor.&quot;

&quot;In 1873 Thomson and Jenkin were engineers for the Western and Brazilian cable. It was manufactured by Hooper &amp; Co., of Millwall and the wire was coated with india rubber, then a new insulator. The &quot;Hooper&quot; left Plymouth in June, and after touching at Madeira, where Thomson was up &#x27;sounding with his special toy&#x27; (the pianoforte wire) &#x27;at half-past three in the morning,&#x27; they reached Pernambuco by the beginning of August, and laid a cable to Pará.&quot;

&quot;During the next two years the Brazilian system was connected to the West Indies and the Río de la Plata but Jenkin was not present on the expeditions. While engaged in this work, the ill-fated &quot;La Plata&quot;, carrying cable from the Siemens AG company to Montevideo, sank in a cyclone off Ushant with the loss of nearly all her crew. The Mackay-Bennett Atlantic cables were also laid under their charge.&quot;

===Pioneer of the supply and demand graphic===
In 1870, Jenkin published the essay &quot;On the Graphical Representation of the Laws of Supply and Demand and their Application to Labour,&quot; in which he &quot;introduced the diagrammatic method into the English economic literature&quot; – an early published instance of supply and demand curves. His treatment extended beyond earlier treatments on the Continent (not apparently known by him), complete with comparative statics (a change in equilibrium from a shifts of a curve), welfare analysis, application to the labour market, and market-period and long-run distinctions. It was later popularised by Alfred Marshall and remains arguably the most famous graphic in economics.

===Sanitary protection associations===
In 1878 Jenkin made a contribution to public health with his pamphlet &quot;Healthy Houses&quot;. &quot;This was not a completely new interest, for sewerage systems were part of the degree course which he taught, and he had already contributed on the subject to the &quot;Sanitary Record&quot;.&quot;

The suggestion was made by William Fairbairn that house inspection by an association of competent individuals would protect homeowners from incompetent tradesmen and outline clearly work necessary for sanitary protection. Jenkin noted, &quot;In respect of Domestic Sanitation the business of Engineer and that of the medical man overlap.&quot; With the assent of Robert Christison, the concept took hold in Edinburgh and Saint Andrews, then in Newport, USA. The report by Alexander Fergusson noted two associations in London in 1882, and sixteen globally.

&quot;Jenkin acted as consulting engineer to the association without pay, rather, as he explained it, like a hospital for the poor where a leading physician would give his services free. ... [The Sanitary Protection Association] was simple, pragmatic, popular – within a few months, there were five hundred subscribers in Edinburgh, and similar groups quickly formed in other British cities ...&quot;

==Personality and assessment==
Jenkin was a clear, fluent speaker, and a successful teacher. He is described as being of medium height, and very plain, with an unimposing manner. His class was always in good order, for he instantly spotted and disciplined anyone who misbehaved. His experimental work was not strikingly original. At Birkenhead he made some accurate measurements of the electrical properties of materials used in submarine cables. Sir William Thomson noted that he was
the first to apply the absolute methods of measurement introduced by Gauss and Weber. He also investigated the laws of electric signals in submarine cables. As Secretary to the British Association Committee on Electrical Standards he played a leading part in providing electricians with practical standards of measurement. His Cantor lectures on submarine cables, and his treatise on &quot;Electricity and Magnetism&quot;, published in 1873, were notable at the time, including the latest developments in the subject. He was associated with Thomson in an ingenious &#x27;curb-key&#x27; for sending signals automatically through a long cable; but it was never adopted. His most important invention was telpherage, a means of transporting goods and passengers to a distance by electric panniers supported on a wire or conductor, which supplied them with electricity. It was patented in 1882, and Jenkin spent his last years on this work, expecting great results from it; but before the first public line was opened for traffic at Glynde, in Sussex, he was dead.

In mechanical engineering his graphical methods of calculating strains in bridges, and determining the efficiency of mechanism, were valuable, and won him the Keith Gold Medal from the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In his spare time Jenkin wrote papers on a wide variety of subjects. Munro, the scholar, complimented him for his paper . In 1878 he constructed a phonograph from the newspaper reports of this new invention, and lectured on it in Edinburgh, then employed it to study the nature of vowel and consonantal sounds. An interesting paper on &#x27;Rhythm in English Verse,&#x27; was also published by him in the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; for 1883.

He could draw a portrait with astonishing rapidity, and had been known to stop a passer-by for a few minutes and sketch her on the spot. His artistic side also shows itself in a paper on &#x27;Artist and Critic,&#x27; in which he defines the difference between the mechanical and fine arts. &#x27;In mechanical arts,&#x27; he says, &#x27;the craftsman uses his skill to produce something useful, but (except in the rare case when he is at liberty to choose what he shall produce) his sole merit lies in skill. In the fine arts the student uses skill to produce something beautiful. He is free to choose what that something shall be, and the layman claims that he may and must judge the artist chiefly by the value in beauty of the thing done. Artistic skill contributes to beauty, or it would not be skill; but beauty is the result of many elements, and the nobler the
art the lower is the rank which skill takes among them.&#x27;

Jenkin was a clear and graphic writer. He read selectively, preferring the story of David, the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the &quot;Arcadia&quot;, the saga of Burnt Njal, and the &quot;Grand Cyrus&quot;. Aeschylus, Sophocles, Shakespeare, Ariosto, Boccaccio, Sir Walter Scott, Dumas, Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, and George Eliot were some of his favourite authors. He was a rapid, fluent talker. Some of his sayings were shrewd and sharp; but he was sometimes aggressive. &#x27;People admire what is pretty in an ugly thing,&#x27; he used to say &#x27;not the ugly thing.&#x27; A lady once said to him she would never be happy again. &#x27;What does that signify?&#x27; cried Jenkin; &#x27;we are not here to be happy, but to be good.&#x27; On a friend remarking that Salvini&#x27;s acting in &quot;Othello&quot; made him want to pray, Jenkin answered, &#x27;That is prayer.&#x27;

Though admired and liked by his intimates, Jenkin was never popular with associates. His manner was hard, rasping, and unsympathetic. &#x27;Whatever virtues he possessed,&#x27; says Mr. Stevenson, &#x27;he could never count on being civil.&#x27; He showed so much courtesy to his wife, however, that a Styrian peasant who observed it spread a report in the village that Mrs.
Jenkin, a great lady, had married beneath her. At the Savile Club, in London, he was known as the &#x27;man who dines here and goes up to Scotland.&#x27; Jenkin was conscious of this churlishness, and latterly improved. &#x27;All my life,&#x27; he wrote,&#x27;I have talked a good deal, with the almost unfailing result of making people sick of the sound of my tongue. It appeared to me that I had various things to say, and I had no malevolent feelings; but, nevertheless, the result was that expressed
above. Well, lately some change has happened. If I talk to a person one day they must have me the next. Faces light up when they see me. &quot;Ah! I say, come here.&quot; &quot; Come and dine with me.&quot; It&#x27;s the most preposterous thing I ever experienced. It is curiously pleasant.&#x27;

Jenkin was a good father, joining in his children&#x27;s play as well as directing their studies. The boys used to wait outside his office for him at the close of business hours; and a story is told of little Frewen, the second son, entering in to him one day, while he was at work, and holding out a toy crane he was making, with the request, &#x27;Papa you might finiss windin&#x27; this for me, I&#x27;m so very busy to-day.&#x27; He was fond of animals too, and his dog Plate regularly accompanied him to the university. But, as he used to say, &#x27;It&#x27;s a cold home where a dog is the only representative of a child.&#x27;

In the Highlands, Jenkin learned to love the Highland character and ways of life. He shot, rode and swam well, and taught his boys athletic exercises, boating, salmon fishing, and so on. He learned to dance a Highland reel, and began the study of Gaelic; but it proved too difficult for Jenkin. Once he took his family to Alt Aussee, in the Steiermark (Styria), where he hunted chamois, won a prize for shooting at the &quot;Schützenfest&quot;, learned the local dialect, sketched the neighbourhood, and danced the &quot;steirischen Ländler&quot; with the peasants.

His parents and parents-in-law had come to live in Edinburgh, but they all died within ten months of each other. Jenkin had showed great devotion to them in their illnesses, and was worn out with grief and watching. His telpherage, too, had given him considerable anxiety; and his mother&#x27;s illness, which affected her mind, had caused him fear. He was planning a holiday to Italy with his wife to recuperate, and had a minor operation on his foot, which resulted in blood poisoning. There seemed to be no danger, and his wife was reading aloud to him as he lay in bed, when his mind began to wander. He probably never regained his senses before he died.

At one period of his life Jenkin was a freethinker, holding all dogmas as &#x27;mere blind struggles to express the inexpressible.&#x27; Nevertheless, as time went on he returned to Christianity. &#x27;The longer I live,&#x27; he wrote, &#x27;the more convinced I become of a direct care by God—which is reasonably impossible—but 
there it is.&#x27; In his last year he took Communion.

== Darwin and evolution ==

In June 1867, Jenkin reviewed Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859), in &quot;The North British Review&quot;. Jenkin criticized Darwin&#x27;s evolutionary theory by suggesting that Darwin&#x27;s interpretation of natural selection couldn&#x27;t possibly work, as described, if the reigning hypothesis of inheritance, blending inheritance, was also valid. Though Gregor Mendel&#x27;s theory of &quot;particulate inheritance&quot; had been already published two years earlier (and would eventually be adopted as the dominant theory of inheritance), neither Jenkin nor Darwin would ever read it, and it would still be several decades before the blending inheritance model would be overturned in the scientific community. In this interim, Jenkin provided a mathematical argument, the swamping argument, that showed that under the blending inheritance model any advantageous mutations which might arise in a species would be quickly diluted out of any species after just a few generations. By contrast, Darwin&#x27;s interpretation of natural selection required hundreds, if not thousands of generations of passing down such mutations in order to work. Jenkin thus concluded that natural selection could not possibly work if blending inheritance were also true. Despite Jenkin&#x27;s argument containing a mistake, as A.S. Davis pointed out in 1871, it did not affect Jenkin&#x27;s conclusion, nor mitigate the damage of Jenkin&#x27;s criticisms of Darwin&#x27;s ideas during the few decades when blending inheritance was still widely accepted.

Jenkin also referred to Lord Kelvin&#x27;s recent (incorrect) estimation of the age of the earth. Kelvin had calculated that Fourier&#x27;s theory of heat and the actions of tides on the earth&#x27;s rotation allowed for an earth no more than 100 million years old and doubted in so far the case for evolution based on the chronology. Criticism by Jenkin and A.W. Bennett, in fact, led Darwin to investigate and discuss the mechanism of inheritance more thoroughly. Darwin avoided a direct confrontation (as well in the case of chronology), but confessed that some of Jenkin&#x27;s arguments were troubling—so troubling, in fact, that Darwin largely abandoned blending inheritance as the potential mechanism for his own inheritance model, pangenesis, in favor of a competing model of inheritance that derived from Lamarckism.

<text>Nirṛti () sometimes spelled Nirruti or Nirriti, is a Hindu deity, personifying death, decay, and sorrow. In early Hindu scriptures, Nirṛti is a goddess who is lives in the kingdom of the dead. In later Hinduism, Nirṛti and Nirṛta is also a male god, who is regarded as a dikapala (&quot;guardian of the directions&quot;) of the southwest.

==Etymology==

The Sanskrit word &quot;Nirṛti&quot; means &#x27;decay&#x27; and is derived from &quot;nirṛ&quot; (lit. &#x27;to separate&#x27;). It can be interpreted as meaning &quot;devoid of &quot;ṛta/i&quot;&quot;, a state of disorder or chaos.

The name &quot;&quot; has the meaning of &quot;absence of ṛta&quot;, meaning &#x27;disorder&#x27;, or &#x27;lawlessness&#x27;, specifically the guardian to the absence of divine or cosmic disorder.

This term was used in Vedic texts to indicate a realm of non-existence and absolute darkness, which threatened to consume those who failed in their duties to sacrifice and procreate. In &quot;nirṛti&quot;, there was no light, no food, and no children: none of the necessary elements of Vedic life and ritual.

==Goddess==
Nirṛti is mentioned in the hymns of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, mostly to seek protection from her or imploring for her during a possible departure. In one hymn (X.59), she is mentioned several times. This hymn, after summing up her nature, also asks for her departure from the sacrificial site. In the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; (V.7.9), she is described as having golden locks. In the &quot;Taittiriya Brahmana&quot; (I.6.1.4), Nirṛtī is described as dark, dressed in dark clothes and her sacrificial shares are dark husks. In the sacred &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; (X.1.2.9), she is associated with the southwest quarter as her region. But elsewhere in the same text (V.2.3.3.) she is mentioned as living in the kingdom of the dead.

In later Hindu texts, Nirṛti was re-conceptualized as a deity. According to some texts, she is the wife of Adharma (not-&quot;dharma&quot;) that signifies an important component of Prakriti for the Purusha who dwell in forests and the mother of three rakshasas—Mrityu (death), Bhaya (fear) and Mahabhaya (terror)—who were collectively referred to as Nairrita. Other texts portray her as the daughter of Adharma and Himsa (violence, the opposite of Ahimsa); she married her brother—Arita (not &quot;ṛta&quot;) and became the mother of Naraka (personification of the hell) and Bhaya. In the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, he is presented as Aprajaḥ (one without children) who takes Adharma and Mṛṣā (untruth), two of Brahma&#x27;s sons or creations, as adopted sons. Some texts identify Nirṛti with other inauspicious goddess, Jyeshtha or Alakshmi. In this context, she is described to have emerged from the Samudra Manthana (the churning of the ocean).

== Dikpala ==

According to some scholars and authors, the goddess Nirṛti transformed into a male in later Hindu mythology and became a &quot;dikpala&quot;. Nirṛti is regarded as the guardian of the southwest direction.

Nirṛti is sometimes included as one of the rudras and described as the son of Sthanu. Varying descriptions of the god Nirṛti are found in different scriptures. According to the Agamas, Nirrti is dark-skinned with a large body and draped in yellow garments. His vahana is either a man or a lion. The &quot;Vishnudharmottara Purana&quot; states that Nirṛti has a terrific appearance with ill-looking eyes, gaping mouth, and exposed teeth. The same scripture also gives a varying account that Nirṛti&#x27;s vahana is a donkey and he holds a &quot;danda&quot; in his hands. &quot;The Vishnudharmottara Purana&quot; also mentions that Nirṛti has four consorts named Devi, Krishnangi, Krishavandana and Krishnapasha. According to the scripture &quot;Devi-Bhagavata Purana&quot;, Nirṛti resides in a city named Krishnajana, which is located in the southwestern part of Mount Meru. The city is said to have an area of 2500 &quot;yojanas&quot;.

<text>Albert Baldwin Wood (December 1, 1879 – May 10, 1956) was an inventor and engineer from New Orleans, Louisiana. He graduated from Tulane University with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering in 1899.

Wood was hired by the Sewerage &amp; Water Board of New Orleans in 1899, to try to improve the flood-prone city&#x27;s drainage, Wood invented &quot;flapgates&quot; and other hydraulic devices, most notably his efficient low-maintenance, high-volume pumps including the Wood Screw Pump (1913) and the Wood Trash Pump (1915). He spearheaded swampland reclamation and development of much of the land now occupied by the city.

While he spent most of his career in New Orleans, Wood also consulted and designed the drainage, pumping, and sewage systems for other cities including Chicago, Milwaukee, Baltimore, and San Francisco, as well as projects in Canada, Egypt, China, and India. His work was especially helpful in the Zuiderzee Works, which reclaimed large areas of land from the Zuider Zee in the Netherlands.

Some of Wood&#x27;s pumps have been in almost continuous use in New Orleans for over 80 years without need of repairs, and new ones continue to be built from his designs.

When Wood died, he left a bequest to Tulane University on the condition that it preserve and display his sailboat, the &quot;Nydia&quot;, for 99 years. Until 2003, the boat was housed in a specially constructed glass-fronted display area located between the University Center and Fogelman Arena. It was moved to make room for the renovation and expansion of University Center. Because Tulane did not fully adhere to the terms of the will, Wood&#x27;s heirs recovered possession of the boat. The &quot;Nydia&quot; is on display at the Maritime and Seafood Industry Museum in Biloxi, Mississippi, not far from where the boat was originally constructed at the Johnson Shipyard.

<text>In Greek and Roman mythology, the Astomi, also known as the Gangines, are an ancient legendary race of people who had no need to eat or drink anything at all. They survived by smelling apples and flowers and perfumes that they sprayed on their victims.

Megasthenes and Pliny the Elder (quoting Megasthenes) mentioned these people in his &quot;Indica&quot;. Megasthenes located them at the mouth of the river Ganges. In his description, they had rough and hairy bodies and no mouths. When traveling, they would carry roots, flowers and apples to smell. They could die by smelling a strong, unpleasant smell.

<text>Atharvan ( , nominative singular: अथर्वा ) is a legendary Vedic sage (rishi) of Hinduism, who along with Angiras, is supposed to have authored (&quot;heard&quot;) the Atharvaveda. He is also said to have first instituted the fire-sacrifice or yajña. Sometimes he is also reckoned among the seven seers, the Saptarishi. His clan is known as the Atharvanas. Atharvan married Shanti, daughter of Prajapati Kardama, and had a great sage Dadhichi as a son. He is referred to as a member of the Bhrigu clan.

According to the Mundaka Upanishad and other texts, he was the eldest son and (Manasaputra) born from mind of the creator deity, Brahma.

== Etymology ==
Vedic &quot;atharvan&quot; is cognate with Avestan &quot;āθrauuan&quot; / &quot;aθaurun&quot;, &quot;priest&quot;, but the etymology of the term is not yet conclusively established. It was once thought to be etymologically related to the Avestan &quot;ātar&quot;, but that is now considered unlikely (Boyce, 2002:16). It has been suggested by scholars that the Vedic and Avestan terms are not of Indo-European origin, and are derived from the BMAC substrate.

<doc id="100542" wikidata="Q1052811" url="?curid=100542" title="Ātman (Hinduism)">
<text>Ātman (; ) is a Sanskrit word for the true or eternal Self or the self-existent essence or an impersonal (&quot;it&quot;) witness-consciousness within each individual. Atman is conceptually different from Jīvātman, which persists across multiple bodies and lifetimes. Some schools of Indian philosophy regard the &quot;Ātman&quot; as distinct from the material or mortal ego (&quot;Ahankara&quot;), the emotional aspect of the mind (&quot;Citta&quot;), and existence in an embodied form (&quot;Prakṛti&quot;). The term is often translated as soul, but is better translated as &quot;Self&quot;, as it solely refers to pure consciousness or witness-consciousness, beyond identification with phenomena. In order to attain moksha (liberation), a human being must acquire self-knowledge (&quot;Atma Gyaan or Brahmajnana&quot;).

&quot;Ātman&quot; is a central concept in the various schools of Indian philosophy, which have different views on the relation between &quot;Atman&quot;, individual Self (&quot;Jīvātman&quot;), supreme Self (&quot;Paramātmā&quot;) and, the Ultimate Reality (&quot;Brahman&quot;), stating that they are: completely identical (Advaita, Non-Dualist), completely different (Dvaita, Dualist), or simultaneously non-different and different (Bhedabheda, Non-Dualist + Dualist).

The six orthodox schools of Hinduism believe that there is &quot;Ātman&quot; in every living being (&quot;jiva&quot;), which is distinct from the body-mind complex. This is a major point of difference with the Buddhist doctrine of &quot;Anatta&quot;, which holds that in essence there is no unchanging essence or Self to be found in the empirical constituents of a living being, staying silent on &quot;what&quot; it is that is liberated.

==Etymology and meaning==

===Etymology===
&quot;Ātman&quot; (&quot;Atma&quot;, आत्मा, आत्मन्) is a Sanskrit word that refers to &quot;essence, breath.&quot; It is derived from the Proto-Indo-European word &quot;&quot; (a root meaning &quot;breath&quot; similar to Ancient Greek &quot;ἀτμός&quot; along with Germanic cognates: Dutch &quot;adem&quot;, Afrikaans &quot;asem&quot;, Old High German &quot;atum&quot; &quot;breath,&quot; Modern German &quot;atmen&quot; &quot;to breathe&quot; and &quot;Atem&quot; &quot;respiration, breath&quot;, Modern English &quot;ethem&quot;, and Old English &quot;ǽþm&quot; and &quot;eþian&quot;).

&quot;Ātman&quot;, sometimes spelled without a diacritic as &quot;atman&quot; in scholarly literature, means &quot;real Self&quot; of the individual, &quot;innermost essence.&quot; While often translated as &quot;soul&quot;, it is better translated as &quot;self.&quot;

===Meaning===
In Hinduism, &quot;Atman&quot; refers to the self-existent essence of human beings, the observing pure consciousness or witness-consciousness as exemplified by the Purusha of Samkhya. It is distinct from the ever-evolving embodied individual being (&quot;jivanatman&quot;) embedded in material reality, exemplified by the prakriti of Samkhya, and characterized by &quot;Ahamkara&quot; (ego, non-spiritual psychological I-ness Me-ness), mind (&quot;citta&quot;, &quot;manas&quot;), and all the defiling &quot;kleshas&quot; (habits, prejudices, desires, impulses, delusions, fads, behaviors, pleasures, sufferings and fears). Embodied personality and &quot;Ahamkara&quot; shift, evolve or change with time, while &quot;Atman&quot; doesn&#x27;t. It is &quot;pure, undifferentiated, self-shining consciousness.&quot;

As such, it is different from non-Hindu notions of soul, which includes consciousness but also the mental abilities of a living being, such as reason, character, feeling, consciousness, memory, perception and thinking. In Hinduism, these are all included in embodied reality, the counterpart of &quot;Atman&quot;.

Atman, in Hinduism, is considered as eternal, imperishable, beyond time, &quot;not the same as body or mind or consciousness, but... something beyond which permeates all these&quot;. &quot;Atman&quot; is the unchanging, eternal, innermost radiant Self that is unaffected by personality, unaffected by ego; &quot;Atman&quot; is that which is ever-free, never-bound, the realized purpose, meaning, liberation in life. As Puchalski states, &quot;the ultimate goal of Hindu religious life is to transcend individuality, to realize one&#x27;s own true nature&quot;, the inner essence of oneself, which is divine and pure.

==Development of the concept==

===Vedas===
The earliest use of the word &quot;Ātman&quot; in Indian texts is found in the Rig Veda (RV X.97.11). Yāska, the ancient Indian grammarian, commenting on this Rigvedic verse, accepts the following meanings of &quot;Ātman&quot;: the pervading principle, the organism in which other elements are united and the ultimate sentient principle.

Other hymns of Rig Veda where the word &quot;Ātman&quot; appears include I.115.1, VII.87.2, VII.101.6, VIII.3.24, IX.2.10, IX.6.8, and X.168.4.

===Upanishads===
&quot;Ātman&quot; is a central topic in all of the Upanishads, and &quot;know your Ātman&quot; is one of their thematic foci. The Upanishads say that &quot;Atman&quot; denotes &quot;the ultimate essence of the universe&quot; as well as &quot;the vital breath in human beings&quot;, which is &quot;imperishable Divine within&quot; that is neither born nor does it die. Cosmology and psychology are indistinguishable, and these texts state that the core of every person&#x27;s Self is not the body, nor the mind, nor the ego, but &quot;Ātman&quot;. The Upanishads express two distinct, somewhat divergent themes on the relation between Atman and Brahman. Some teach that Brahman (highest reality; universal principle; being-consciousness-bliss) is identical with &quot;Ātman&quot;, while others teach that &quot;Ātman&quot; is part of Brahman but not identical to it. This ancient debate flowered into various dual and non-dual theories in Hinduism. The Brahmasutra by Badarayana (~100 BCE) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories, stating that &quot;Atman&quot; and Brahman are different in some respects, particularly during the state of ignorance, but at the deepest level and in the state of self-realization, &quot;Atman&quot; and Brahman are identical, non-different (advaita). According to Koller, this synthesis countered the dualistic tradition of Samkhya-Yoga schools and realism-driven traditions of Nyaya-Vaiseshika schools, enabling it to become the foundation of Vedanta as Hinduism&#x27;s most influential spiritual tradition.

====&quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot;====
The &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; (800-600 BCE) describes &quot;Atman&quot; as that in which everything exists, which is of the highest value, which permeates everything, which is the essence of all, bliss and beyond description. In hymn 4.4.5, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes &quot;Atman&quot; as &quot;Brahman&quot;, and associates it with everything one is, everything one can be, one&#x27;s free will, one&#x27;s desire, what one does, what one doesn&#x27;t do, the good in oneself, the bad in oneself.
This theme of &quot;Ātman&quot;, that the essence and Self of every person and being is the same as Brahman, is extensively repeated in Brihadāranyaka Upanishad. The Upanishad asserts that this knowledge of &quot;I am Brahman&quot;, and that there is no difference between &quot;I&quot; and &quot;you&quot;, or &quot;I&quot; and &quot;him&quot; is a source of liberation, and not even gods can prevail over such a liberated man. For example, in hymn 1.4.10,
====&quot;Chandogya Upanishad&quot;====
The &quot;Chandogya Upanishad&quot; (7th-6th c. BCE) explains &quot;Ātman&quot; as that which appears to be separate between two living beings but isn&#x27;t, that essence and innermost, true, radiant self of all individuals which connects and unifies all. Hymn 6.10 explains it with the example of rivers, some of which flow to the east and some to the west, but ultimately all merge into the ocean and become one. In the same way, the individual souls are pure being, states the &quot;Chandogya Upanishad&quot;; an individual soul is pure truth, and an individual soul is a manifestation of the ocean of one universal soul.

====&quot;Katha Upanishad&quot;====
Along with the &quot;Brihadāranyaka&quot;, all the earliest and middle Upanishads discuss &quot;Ātman&quot; as they build their theories to answer how man can achieve liberation, freedom and bliss. The &quot;Katha Upanishad&quot; (5th to 1st century BCE) explains &quot;Atman&quot; as the imminent and transcendent innermost essence of each human being and living creature, that this is one, even though the external forms of living creatures manifest in different forms. Hymn 2.2.9 states:
Katha Upanishad, in Book 1, hymns 3.3-3.4, describes the widely cited proto-Samkhya analogy of chariot for the relation of &quot;Soul, Self&quot; to body, mind and senses. Stephen Kaplan translates these hymns as, &quot;Know the Self as the rider in a chariot, and the body as simply the chariot. Know the intellect as the charioteer, and the mind as the reins. The senses, they say are the horses, and sense objects are the paths around them&quot;. The Katha Upanishad then declares that &quot;when the Self [Ātman] understands this and is unified, integrated with body, senses and mind, is virtuous, mindful and pure, he reaches bliss, freedom and liberation&quot;.

==== Bhagavad Gita ====
In Bhagavad Gita verses 10-30 of the second chapter, Krishna urges Arjuna to understand the indestructible nature of the &quot;atman&quot;, emphasizing that it transcends the finite body it inhabits. The &quot;atman&quot; neither kills nor can be killed, as it is eternal and unaffected by birth or death. The analogy of changing clothes is used to illustrate how the soul discards old bodies for new ones. Krishna emphasizes the eternal existence of the soul by explaining that even as it undergoes various life stages and changes bodies it remains unaffected. It is imperceptible, inconceivable, and unchanging.

==Indian philosophy==

===Orthodox schools===
Atman is a metaphysical and spiritual concept for Hindus, often discussed in their scriptures with the concept of Brahman. All major orthodox schools of Hinduism – Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisesika, Mimamsa, and Vedanta – accept the foundational premise of the Vedas and Upanishads that &quot;Ātman exists.&quot; In Hindu philosophy, especially in the Vedanta school of Hinduism, &quot;Ātman&quot; is the first principle. Jainism too accepts this premise, although it has its own idea of what that means. In contrast, both Buddhism and the Charvakas deny that there is anything called &quot;Ātman/soul/self&quot;.

====Samkhya====

In Samkhya, the oldest school of Hinduism, Puruṣa, the witness-consciousness, is &quot;Atman&quot;. It is absolute, independent, free, imperceptible, unknowable through other agencies, above any experience by mind or senses and beyond any words or explanations. It remains pure, &quot;nonattributive consciousness&quot;. Puruṣa is neither produced nor does it produce. No appellations can qualify purusha, nor can it substantialized or objectified. It &quot;cannot be reduced, can&#x27;t be &#x27;settled&#x27;.&quot; Any designation of purusha comes from prakriti, and is a limitation. Unlike Advaita Vedanta, and like Purva-Mīmāṃsā, Samkhya believes in plurality of the puruṣas.

Samkhya considers ego (&quot;asmita&quot;, &quot;ahamkara&quot;) to be the cause of pleasure and pain. Self-knowledge is the means to attain &quot;kaivalya&quot;, the separation of &quot;Atman&quot; from the body-mind complex.

====Yoga philosophy====
The Yogasutra of Patanjali, the foundational text of Yoga school of Hinduism, mentions &quot;Atma&quot; in multiple verses, and particularly in its last book, where Samadhi is described as the path to self-knowledge and kaivalya. Some earlier mentions of &quot;Atman&quot; in Yogasutra include verse 2.5, where evidence of ignorance includes &quot;confusing what is not Atman as Atman&quot;.

In verses 2.19-2.20, Yogasutra declares that pure ideas are the domain of Atman, the perceivable universe exists to enlighten Atman, but while Atman is pure, it may be deceived by complexities of perception or mind. These verses also set the purpose of all experience as a means to self-knowledge.

In Book 4, Yogasutra states spiritual liberation as the stage where the yogin achieves distinguishing self-knowledge, he no longer confuses his mind as Atman, the mind is no longer affected by afflictions or worries of any kind, ignorance vanishes, and &quot;pure consciousness settles in its own pure nature&quot;.

The Yoga school is similar to the Samkhya school in its conceptual foundations of &quot;Ātman&quot;. It is the self that is discovered and realized in the Kaivalya state, in both schools. Like Samkhya, this is not a single universal &quot;Ātman&quot;. It is one of the many individual selves where each &quot;pure consciousness settles in its own pure nature&quot;, as a unique distinct soul/self. However, Yoga school&#x27;s methodology was widely influential on other schools of Hindu philosophy. Vedanta monism, for example, adopted Yoga as a means to reach &quot;Jivanmukti&quot; – self-realization in this life – as conceptualized in Advaita Vedanta. Yoga and Samkhya define &quot;Ātman&quot; as an &quot;unrelated, attributeless, self-luminous, omnipresent entity&quot;, which is identical with consciousness.

====Nyaya====
Early atheistic Nyaya scholars, and later theistic Nyaya scholars, both made substantial contributions to the systematic study of &quot;Ātman&quot;. They posited that even though &quot;self&quot; is intimately related to the knower, it can still be the subject of knowledge. John Plott states that the Nyaya scholars developed a theory of negation that far exceeds Hegel&#x27;s theory of negation, while their epistemological theories refined to &quot;know the knower&quot; at least equals Aristotle&#x27;s sophistication. Nyaya methodology influenced all major schools of Hinduism.

Nyaya scholars defined &quot;Ātman&quot; as an imperceptible substance that is the substrate of human consciousness, manifesting itself with or without qualities such as desires, feelings, perception, knowledge, understanding, errors, insights, sufferings, bliss, and others. 

Nyaya theory of the &quot;ātman&quot; had two broader contributions to Hindu conceptions of the &quot;ātman&quot;. One, Nyaya scholars went beyond holding it as &quot;self evident&quot; and offered rational proofs, consistent with their epistemology, in their debates with Buddhists, that &quot;Atman exists&quot;. Second, they developed theories on what &quot;Atman is and is not&quot;. As proofs for the proposition &#x27;self exists&#x27;, for example, Nyaya scholars argued that personal recollections and memories of the form &quot;I did this so many years ago&quot; implicitly presume that there is a self that is substantial, continuing, unchanged, and existent.

Nyayasutra, a 2nd-century CE foundational text of Nyaya school of Hinduism, states that Atma is a proper object of human knowledge. It also states that Atman is a real substance that can be inferred from certain signs, objectively perceivable attributes. For example, in book 1, chapter 1, verses 9 and 10, Nyayasutra states
Book 2, chapter 1, verses 1 to 23, of the Nyayasutras posits that the sensory act of looking is different from perception and cognition–that perception and knowledge arise from the seekings and actions of &quot;Ātman&quot;. The Naiyayikas emphasize that &quot;Ātman&quot; has qualities, but is different from its qualities. For example, desire is one of many qualities of &quot;Ātman&quot;, but &quot;Ātman&quot; does not always have desire, and in the state of liberation, for instance, the &quot;Ātman&quot; is without desire. Additionally, the self has the property of consciousness, but that too, is not an essential property. Naiyayikas take the &quot;ātman&quot; to lose consciousness during deep sleep.

====Vaiśeṣika====
The Vaisheshika school of Hinduism, using its non-theistic theories of atomistic naturalism, posits that &quot;Ātman&quot; is one of the four eternal non-physical substances without attributes, the other three being &quot;kāla&quot; (time), &quot;dik&quot; (space) and &quot;manas&quot; (mind). Time and space, stated Vaiśeṣika scholars, are &quot;eka&quot; (one), &quot;nitya&quot; (eternal) and &quot;vibhu&quot; (all pervading). Time and space are indivisible reality, but human mind prefers to divide them to comprehend past, present, future, relative place of other substances and beings, direction and its own coordinates in the universe. In contrast to these characteristics of time and space, Vaiśeṣika scholars considered &quot;Ātman&quot; to be many, eternal, independent and spiritual substances that cannot be reduced or inferred from other three non-physical and five physical &quot;dravya&quot; (substances). Mind and sensory organs are instruments, while consciousness is the domain of &quot;atman, soul, self&quot;.

The knowledge of &quot;Ātman&quot;, to Vaiśeṣika Hindus, is another knowledge without any &quot;bliss&quot; or &quot;consciousness&quot; &quot;moksha&quot; state that Vedanta and Yoga school describe.

====Mimamsa====
&quot;Ātman&quot;, in the ritualism-based Mīmāṃsā school of Hinduism, is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active essence that is identified as I-consciousness. Unlike all other schools of Hinduism, Mimamsaka scholars considered ego and &quot;Atman&quot; as the same. Within Mimamsa school, there was divergence of beliefs. Kumārila, for example, believed that &quot;Atman&quot; is the object of I-consciousness, whereas Prabhākara believed that &quot;Atman&quot; is the subject of I-consciousness. Mimamsaka Hindus believed that what matters is virtuous actions and rituals completed with perfection, and it is this that creates merit and imprints knowledge on &quot;Atman&quot;, whether one is aware or not aware of &quot;Atman&quot;. Their foremost emphasis was formulation and understanding of laws/duties/virtuous life (&quot;dharma&quot;) and consequent perfect execution of &quot;kriyas&quot; (actions). The Upanishadic discussion of &quot;Atman&quot;, to them, was of secondary importance. While other schools disagreed and discarded the &quot;Atma&quot; theory of Mimamsa, they incorporated Mimamsa theories on ethics, self-discipline, action, and dharma as necessary in one&#x27;s journey toward knowing one&#x27;s &quot;Atman&quot;.

====Vedanta====

=====Advaita Vedanta=====
Advaita Vedanta (non-dualism) sees the &quot;spirit/soul/self&quot; within each living entity as being fully identical with Brahman. The Advaita school believes that there is one soul that connects and exists in all living beings, regardless of their shapes or forms, and there is no distinction, no superior, no inferior, no separate devotee soul (&quot;Atman&quot;), no separate god soul (Brahman). The oneness unifies all beings, there is divine in every being, and that all existence is a single reality, state the Advaita Vedanta Hindus. In contrast, devotional sub-schools of Vedanta such as Dvaita (dualism) differentiate between the individual &quot;Atma&quot; in living beings, and the supreme &quot;Atma&quot; (&quot;Paramatma&quot;) as being separate.

Advaita Vedanta philosophy considers &quot;Atman&quot; as Sat-cit-ānanda, self-existent awareness, limitless and non-dual. To Advaitins, the &quot;Atman&quot; is the Brahman, the Brahman is the &quot;Atman&quot;, each self is non-different from the infinite. &quot;Atman&quot; is the universal principle, one eternal undifferentiated self-luminous consciousness, the truth asserts Advaita Hinduism. Human beings, in a state of unawareness of this universal self, see their &quot;I-ness&quot; as different from the being in others, then act out of impulse, fears, cravings, malice, division, confusion, anxiety, passions, and a sense of distinctiveness. To Advaitins, Atman-knowledge is the state of full awareness, liberation, and freedom that overcomes dualities at all levels, realizing the divine within oneself, the divine in others, and in all living beings; the non-dual oneness, that God is in everything, and everything is God. This identification of individual living beings/souls, or &quot;jiva-atmas&quot;, with the &#x27;one Atman&#x27; is the non-dualistic Advaita Vedanta position.

===== Dvaita Vedanta =====
The monist, non-dual conception of existence in Advaita Vedanta is not accepted by the dualistic/theistic Dvaita Vedanta. Dvaita Vedanta calls the &quot;Atman&quot; of a supreme being as &quot;Paramatman&quot;, and holds it to be different from individual &quot;Atman&quot;. Dvaita scholars assert that God is the ultimate, complete, perfect, but distinct soul, one that is separate from incomplete, imperfect &quot;jivas&quot; (individual souls). The Advaita sub-school believes that self-knowledge leads to liberation in this life, while the Dvaita sub-school believes that liberation is only possible in after-life as communion with God, and only through the grace of God (if not, then one&#x27;s &quot;Atman&quot; is reborn). God created individual souls, state Dvaita Vedantins, but the individual soul never was and never will become one with God; the best it can do is to experience bliss by getting infinitely close to God. The Dvaita school, therefore, in contrast to the monistic position of Advaita, advocates a version of monotheism wherein Brahman is made synonymous with Vishnu (or Narayana), distinct from numerous individual Atmans.

===Buddhism===
Applying the disidentification of &#x27;no-self&#x27; to the logical end, Buddhism does not assert an unchanging essence, any &quot;eternal, essential and absolute something called a soul, self or atman,&quot; According to Jayatilleke, the Upanishadic inquiry fails to find an empirical correlate of the assumed Atman, but nevertheless assumes its existence, and, states Mackenzie, Advaitins &quot;reify consciousness as an eternal self.&quot; In contrast, the Buddhist inquiry &quot;is satisfied with the empirical investigation which shows that no such Atman exists because there is no evidence&quot; states Jayatilleke.

While Nirvana is liberation from the &quot;kleshas&quot; and the disturbances of the mind-body complex, Buddhism eludes a definition of &quot;what&quot; it is that is liberated. According to Johannes Bronkhorst, &quot;it is possible that original Buddhism did not deny the existence of soul,&quot; but did not want to talk about it, as they could not say that &quot;the soul is essentially not involved in action, as their opponents did.&quot; While the skandhas are regarded is impermanent (&quot;anatman&quot;) and sorrowfull (&quot;dukkha&quot;), the existence of a permanent, joyful and unchanging self is neither acknowledged nor explicitly denied. Liberation is not attained by knowledge of such a self, but by &quot; turning away from what might erroneously be regarded as the self.&quot;

According to Harvey, in Buddhism the negation of temporal existents is applied even more rigorously than in the Upanishads:
Nevertheless, Atman-like notions can also be found in Buddhist texts chronologically placed in the 1st millennium of the Common Era, such as the Mahayana tradition&#x27;s &quot;Tathāgatagarbha sūtras&quot; suggest self-like concepts, variously called &quot;Tathagatagarbha&quot; or &quot;Buddha nature&quot;. In the Theravada tradition, the Dhammakaya Movement in Thailand teaches that it is erroneous to subsume nirvana under the rubric of &quot;anatta&quot; (non-self); instead, nirvana is taught to be the &quot;true self&quot; or &quot;dhammakaya&quot;. Similar interpretations have been put forth by the then Thai Sangharaja in 1939. According to Williams, the Sangharaja&#x27;s interpretation echoes the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; sutras.

The notion of Buddha-nature is controversial, and &quot;eternal self&quot; concepts have been vigorously attacked. These &quot;self-like&quot; concepts are neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality. Some scholars posit that the &quot;Tathagatagarbha Sutras&quot; were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists. The Dhammakaya Movement teaching that nirvana is atta (atman) has been criticized as heretical in Buddhism by Prayudh Payutto, a well-known scholar monk, who added that &#x27;Buddha taught nibbana as being non-self&quot;. This dispute on the nature of teachings about &#x27;self&#x27; and &#x27;non-self&#x27; in Buddhism has led to arrest warrants, attacks and threats.

==Influence of Atman-concept on Hindu ethics==

The &quot;Atman&quot; theory in Upanishads had a profound impact on ancient ethical theories and dharma traditions now known as Hinduism. The earliest Dharmasutras of Hindus recite &quot;Atman&quot; theory from the Vedic texts and Upanishads, and on its foundation build precepts of dharma, laws and ethics. &quot;Atman&quot; theory, particularly the Advaita Vedanta and Yoga versions, influenced the emergence of the theory of &quot;Ahimsa&quot; (non-violence against all creatures), culture of vegetarianism, and other theories of ethical, dharmic life.

===Dharma-sutras===
The Dharmasutras and Dharmasastras integrate the teachings of &quot;Atman&quot; theory. Apastamba Dharmasutra, the oldest known Indian text on dharma, for example, titles Chapters 1.8.22 and 1.8.23 as &quot;Knowledge of the Atman&quot; and then recites,

===Ahimsa===
The ethical prohibition against harming any human beings or other living creatures (Ahimsa, अहिंसा), in Hindu traditions, can be traced to the &quot;Atman&quot; theory. This precept against injuring any living being appears together with Atman theory in hymn 8.15.1 of Chandogya Upanishad (ca. 8th century BCE), then becomes central in the texts of Hindu philosophy, entering the dharma codes of ancient &quot;Dharmasutras&quot; and later era &quot;Manu-Smriti&quot;. Ahimsa theory is a natural corollary and consequence of &quot;Atman is universal oneness, present in all living beings. Atman connects and prevades in everyone. Hurting or injuring another being is hurting the Atman, and thus one&#x27;s self that exists in another body&quot;. This conceptual connection between one&#x27;s &quot;Atman&quot;, the universal, and Ahimsa starts in Isha Upanishad, develops in the theories of the ancient scholar Yajnavalkya, and one which inspired Gandhi as he led non-violent movement against colonialism in early 20th century.

<text>Atri or Attri is a Vedic sage, who is credited with composing numerous shlokas to Agni, Indra, and other Vedic deities of Hinduism. Atri is one of the Saptarishi (seven great Vedic sages) in the Hindu tradition, and the one most mentioned in its scripture Rigveda.

The fifth Mandala (Book 5) of the Rigveda is called the Atri Mandala in his honour, and the eighty seven shlokas in it are attributed to him and his descendants.

Atri is also mentioned in the Puranas and the Hindu epics of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.

== Legend ==

Atri is one of the seven great Rishis or Saptarshi along with Agastya, Bhardwaja, Gautama, Jamadagni, Vashistha, and Vishvamitra. According to the legends of the Vedic era, sage Atri was married to Anasuya Devi. They had three sons, Dattatreya, Durvasa and Chandra. As per divine account, he is the last among the seven Saptarishis and is believed to have originated from the tongue. The wife of Atri was Anasuya, who is considered one of the seven female pativratas. When instructed by divine voice to do tapas, Atri readily agreed and did severe tapas. Pleased by his devotion and prayers, the Hindu trinity, namely, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva appeared before him and offered him boons. He sought all the three to be born to him. Another version of the legend states that Anasuya, by the powers of her chastity, rescued the three gods and in return, they were born as children to her. Brahma was born to her as Chandra, Vishnu as Dattatreya and Shiva in some part as Durvasa. The mention of Atri is found in various scriptures, with the notable being in &quot;Rig Veda&quot;. He is also associated with various ages, the notable being in Treta Yuga during &quot;Ramayana&quot;, when he and Anasuya advised Rama and his wife Sita. The pair is also attributed to bringing river Ganga down to earth, the mention of which is found in the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot;.

He is said to be a resident of the south in Valmiki Ramayana. The same is supported by Puranic tradition.

== Seer of Rig Veda ==

He is the seer of the fifth Mandala (Book 5) of the Rigveda. Atri had many sons and disciples who have also contributed in the compilation of the Rig Veda and other Vedic texts. Mandala 5 comprises 87 shlokas, mainly to Agni and Indra, but also to the Visvedevas (&quot;all the gods&#x27;), the Maruts, the twin-deity Mitra-Varuna and the Asvins. Two shlokas each are dedicated to Ushas (the dawn) and to Savitr. Most shlokas in this book are attributed to the Atri clan composers, called the &quot;Atreyas&quot;.

The Atri shlokas of the Rigveda are significant for their melodic structure as well as for featuring spiritual ideas in the form of riddles. These shlokas include lexical, syntactic, morphological and verb play utilizing the flexibility of the Sanskrit language. The shloka 5.44 of the Rigveda in Atri Mandala is considered by scholars such as Geldner to be the most difficult riddle shloka in all of the Rigveda. The verses are also known for their elegant presentation of natural phenomenon through divinely inspired poems, such as poetically presenting dawn as a cheerful woman in shloka 5.80.

While the fifth mandala is attributed to Atri and his associates, sage Atri is mentioned or credited with numerous other verses of the Rigveda in other Mandalas, such as 10.137.4.

== Ramayana ==
In the Ramayana, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana visit Atri and Anasuya in their hermitage. Atri&#x27;s hut is described to be in Chitrakuta, near a lake with divine music and songs, the water loaded with flowers, green water leaves, with many &quot;cranes, fisherbirds, floating tortoises, swans, frogs and pink geese&quot;.

== Puranas ==
A number of sages named Atri are mentioned in the various medieval era Puranas. The legends therein about Atri are diverse and inconsistent. It is unclear if these refer to the same person, or to different Rishis who had the same name.

== Cultural influence ==

The Vaikhanasas sub-tradition within Vaishnavism found in South India near Tirupati, credit their theology to four Rishis (sages), namely Atri, Marichi, Bhrigu and Kashyapa. One of the ancient texts of this tradition is &quot;Atri Samhita&quot;, which survives in highly inconsistent fragments of manuscripts. The text are rules of conduct aimed at Brahmins of the &quot;Vaikhanasas&quot; tradition. The surviving parts of the &quot;Atri Samhita&quot; suggest that the text discussed, among other things, yoga, and ethics of living, with precepts such as:

The Vaikhanasas continue to be a significant community in South India, and they adhere to their Vedic heritage.

<text>The Pacific Maritime Association (PMA) is a non-profit organization based in San Francisco, California that represents employers of the shipping industry on the Pacific coast.

==Background==
The Pacific Maritime Association was founded in 1949 as a non-profit corporation. It represented a merger of the Waterfront Employers Association (WEA) and the American Shipowners Association (ASA). Its principal business is to negotiate and administer labor agreements with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU). PMA&#x27;s 72 members are cargo carriers, terminal operators, and stevedores that operate along the U.S. West Coast.

In 1960, it negotiated the Mechanization and Modernization Agreement.

As of December 2012, PMA members employed nearly 14,000 registered longshore, clerk and foreman workers at 29 west coast ports in California, Oregon, and Washington, and thousands more “casual” workers, who typically work part-time. Since the 2002 agreement that brought the widespread use of technology to the West Coast, the registered workforce has increased by 32 percent.

In 2015, it negotiated a five-year contract with the ILWU.

<doc id="100545" wikidata="Q2477202" url="?curid=100545" title="Ayyappan">
<text>Ayyappan, also known as Dharmasastha and Manikandan, is the Hindu deity of truth and righteousness. According to Hindu theology, he is described as the son of Shiva and Mohini (the female avatar of Vishnu), thus representing a bridge between Shaivism and Vaishnavism.
Ayyappan is a warrior deity and is revered for his ascetic devotion to Dharma, the ethical and right way of living. He is usually depicted as a youthful man riding or near a Bengal tiger and holding a bow and arrow. In some representations, he is seen holding a sword and riding an Indian elephant or a horse. Other iconography generally shows him in a yogic posture wearing a bell around his neck.

The legend and mythology of Ayyappan varies across regions, reflecting a tradition that evolved over time. According to Malayalam lore, Ayyappan is presented as a warrior prince of Pandala kingdom. In the later years, the stories of Ayyappan expanded with various versions describing him as a warrior who protected people from evil doers while helping restore Dharmic practices and he evolved to be a deity. In some regions, Ayyappan and Tamil folk deity Ayyanar are considered to be the same with similar characteristics.

Although Ayyappan worship has been prevalent earlier in Kerala, his popularity spread in the 20th century to most of Southern India. His abode Sabarimala is located on the banks of river Pamba in the forests of the Western Ghats, and is a major pilgrimage destination, attracting millions annually. Pilgrims often engage in weeks of preparations in advance by leading a simpler life, remaining celibate, and trekking to the hill on barefoot while carrying an &quot;irumudi&quot; (a bag with offerings) on the head.

== Names and etymology ==
The name Ayyappan is a combination of two words &quot;ayyan&quot; and &quot;appan&quot;. &quot;Ayyan&quot; in Tamil and the similar Malayalam word &quot;acchan&quot; means &quot;father&quot;. &quot;Appan&quot; is also used to denote &quot;father&quot;; in Tamil both words are also used as honorific titles. He is described as the son of Mohini (the female form of Vishnu) and Shiva with the name Ayyappan connoting as &quot;lord-father&quot;. The name could have also been derived from the combination of &quot;aryan&quot; and &quot;appan&quot; with the former meaning &quot;revered&quot;.

In the Hindu scriptures such as &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; and &quot;Srimad Bhagavatham&quot;, he is referenced as &quot;Dharmasastha&quot; and &quot;Sastha&quot;, meaning &quot;ruler of the realm&quot;. The word &quot;Sastha&quot; could have also be derived from Buddhism as Ayyappan is seen as an incarnation of Buddha and Buddha was known by the same name, meaning teacher. He is also known as &quot;Hariharasuthan&quot;, meaning the &quot;son of Harihara&quot; as a fusion of &quot;Hari&quot; and &quot;Hara&quot;, the names given to Vishnu and Shiva respectively. He is also called &quot;Manikanda&quot; with &quot;mani&quot; meaning bell and &quot;kanda&quot; meaning neck in Sanskrit, translating to the wearer of a bell on the neck.

== Iconography and depictions==
Ayyappan is a warrior deity and is revered for his ascetic devotion to Dharma, the ethical and right way of living, to deploy his military genius and daring yogic war abilities to destroy those who are powerful but unethical, abusive and arbitrary. He is usually represented as a celibate young man with a bow and arrow, riding a bengal tiger. In some representations, he is seen holding an upraised bow in his left hand, while holding either an arrow or sword in his right hand placed diagonally across his left thigh. Other iconography generally shows him in a yogic posture wearing a bell around his neck. In some representations, such as in Sri Lanka, he is shown riding an Indian elephant or a horse.

== Theology and historical development==
The legend and mythology of Ayyappan varies across regions, reflecting a tradition that evolved over time. According to the &quot;Puranas&quot;, he is mentioned as an incarnation of Hariharaputra, the son of Shiva and Mohini. While this interaction between Shiva and Mohini is mentioned in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, he is not mentioned by the name of Ayyappa. 

According to Malayalam folklore, Ayyappan is presented as a warrior prince of Pandala kingdom. As the royal family was childless, the king of Pandalam found a baby boy on the banks of Pamba River. The king named the boy Manikantha and raised him his own son, on the advice of an ascetic. When Manikantha was 12 years old, the king wanted to formally anoint him as the heir. However, the queen objected to it, favoring her younger biological child. The queen feigned an illness, asking for the milk of a tiger to cure her illness and demanded that Manikantha be sent to obtain the same. He volunteered and went into the forest and returned riding a tigress. He confronted and defeated the demoness Mahishi. Mahishi wanted to be his wife but Ayyappa being celibate, refused the offer and killed the demoness. The king realised his special ability and recognised him to be a divine being and resolved to make a shrine for him. Manikantha transforms into Ayyappa and shoots an arrow to denote the place for the shrine. 

There are minor variations in the story in certain versions with Ayyappa renouncing the kingdom and becoming an ascetic yogi in a forested mountain. In another version, he is described as the son of the king&#x27;s sister, who was born in the forest and sent to his uncle later. When the shrine of Sastha at Sabarimala was destroyed by the king&#x27;s enemies, he defeated them, re-installed the statue and disappeared into it. In some versions, he was raised by a childless royal couple Rajashekara Pandian and Koperundevi, and grew up as a warrior yogi. 

According to Paul Younger, supplementary legends appeared in the late medieval times that linked other Hindu deities and mythologies to Ayyappan. The divine beings Datta and Leela came to earth as humans. Datta wanted to return to the divine realm, but Leela enjoyed her life on earth and wanted to stay on earth. He became angry and cursed her to become a Mahishi (water buffalo demoness). Leela in turn cursed him to become Mahisha, a water buffalo demon and they both plundered the earth with their evil acts. Mahishasura was later killed by goddess Durga, while Mahishi was killed by Ayyapan, ending the terror of evil and liberating Leela who was previously cursed. These legends syncretically linked and combined various Hindu traditions around Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism.

In the later years, the stories of Ayyappan expanded. One such version has roots between the 1st and 3rd century CE, where he evolved to be a deity who protected traders and merchants from enemies such as robbers and plundering outlaws. His temples and traditions inspired Hindu yogi mercenaries who protected the trade routes in South India from criminals and helped restore Dharmic trading practices. In another version, he is portrayed as a child of a priest whose father was murdered by a fearsome outlaw. The outlaw kidnaps a princess and he makes a daring rescue killing the outlaw in the process. In a variation of the story, Ayyappan forms an alliance with the Muslim warrior Vavar against the outlaw Udayanan, which forms the basis for worshiping both in a mosque and then in the Hindu temple before starting a pilgrimage to Ayyappa shrine.

According to Eliza Kent, the legends in the Ayyappa tradition seem to be &quot;artificially mixed and assembled into a kind of collage&quot;. Ruth Vanita suggests that Ayyappan probably emerged from the fusion of a Dravidian god of tribal provenance and the Puranic story of Shiva and Mohini&#x27;s interaction. In some regions, Ayyappan and Tamil folk deity Ayyanar are considered to be the same with similar characteristics and is cited as a reason for his large following amongst Tamils.

== Worship==
Although Ayyappan worship has been prevalent earlier in Kerala, his popularity spread in the 20th century to most of Southern India. While there are many temples in South India whose presiding deity is Ayyappan, the most prominent shrine is located at Sabarimala on the banks of river Pamba in the hills of Western Ghats in Kerala. It is a major pilgrimage center, attracting millions of Hindus every year. The temple is open only on select days of a year.

Pilgrims often begin preparations weeks in advance by leading a simpler life, remaining celibate, eating a vegetarian diet or partially fasting and wearing a black or blue dress. These weeks of rituals are termed as &quot;Vrutham&quot; which is signified by wearing a Tulsi or Rudraksha mala. The pilgrims do not recognize any form of social or economic discrimination and form a fraternity treating each other as equals. The pilgrims call each other by the same name &quot;Swami&quot; meaning &quot;God&quot;. The pilgrims bath in the Pamba river and embark on a trek to the top of the hill on barefoot while carrying an &quot;irumudi&quot; (a bag with two compartments containing offerings) on the head. Then they climb the 18 steps in front of the shrine, each representing a dharmic value. The priests and devotees bring flowers and scatter them near the shrine while chanting various shlokas. As the deity is believed to be celibate, women in their fertile age are not allowed to enter the shrine. The most significant festival linked to him is the Makaravilakku, observed around the winter solstice. Harivarasanam is a Manipravalam ashtakam composed in praise of Shiva but sung as a lullaby for Ayyappan.

Other temples include Achankovil Sastha Temple, Aryankavu Sastha Temple, Erumely Sree Dharmasastha Temple, and Kulathupuzha Sastha Temple in Kerala. Temples at Tamil Nadu are located in Anna Nagar, Mahalingapuram, Perambur, and Rajah Annamalaipuram in Chennai, and Coimbatore. While Ayyappa temples typically show him as a celibate yogi, a few temples such as the one at Achankovil Sastha Temple depict him as a married man with two wives Poorna and Pushkala, as well as a son Satyaka. Some of Ayyappa temples are believed to have been established by Parashurama. In Ponnambalamedu hillock in the Western Ghats, a ritual lighting of a large flame is carried out during Makaravilakku.

Ayyappan remains one of the few deities in Hindu tradition, who is respected by other religious communities, including Muslims, and Christians. As per Government of Kerala, there is a theory that the temple of Sabarimala was of Buddhist origin. Ayyappan is also revered by Muslims in Kerala due to his association with Vavar. In this mythology, Ayyappa confronts the plunder-driven pirate robber Vavar in the jungle with Ayyappa defeating Vavar, who then becomes Ayyappa&#x27;s trusted lieutenant helping fight other pirates and robbers. In another version, Vavar is stated to be a Muslim saint from Arabia, who works with him. A mosque dedicated to Vavar stands next to the Kadutha swami shrine at the foot of the pilgrimage path, both as a form of guardian deities. Pilgrims offer a prayer to both, before beginning the trek towards Sabarimala. According to Kent, the mosque does not contain mortal remains of Vavar though the mosque near Sabarimala includes a grave, and no one can date Vavar nor provide when and where he lived, so he may be a myth. The Vavar legend and &quot;palli&quot; shrines may reflect the Hindu approach to accepting and co-opting legendary figures or saints of other religions within its fold.

== Popular culture ==
A number of Indian films have been made about Ayyappan. These include: &quot;Sabarimala Ayyappan&quot; (1961) by S. M. Sriramulu Naidu, &quot;Swami Ayyappan&quot; (1975) by P.

The story of Ayyappan was adapted as a comic in the 673rd issue of the Indian comic book series, Amar Chitra Katha.

<doc id="100549" wikidata="Q130811" url="?curid=100549" title="Flag of Romania">
<text>The national flag of Romania () is a tricolour featuring three equal vertical bands colored blue (at the flagpole), yellow and red, with a width to length ratio of 2:3.

The current version was adopted in 1989 in the wake of the Romanian Revolution and is defined in the Constitution of Romania as well as by organic law 75/1994, plus several later clarifications. Starting in 2023, the law provides exact color shades for print and digital purposes.

The colors have seen documented use individually or in pairs on official insignia and symbols as far back as the 14th century but they were first officially used together on a flag in the 19th century.

While the flag has undergone multiple variations over the years, the overall design has remained fairly consistent, using the same colors and with similar placement of the bands relative to each other.

==Legal framework and specifications==

Law no. 75/1994 specifies that the flag height is 2/3 of the width and that the color stripes are of equal size with blue at the hoist.

Prior to 2023, the law specified the colors using the cobalt blue, chrome yellow and vermilion red pigments, but did not go into further detail.

In the 2023 revision of the law, the pigments were replaced with exact color shades in the Pantone, CMYK and RGB color models (see below).

Please note that the hexadecimal values (&quot;web colors&quot;) given here are a direct conversion from the official RGB values but are not present in the official act.

==History and significance of the colors==
===Early use of the colors===

The blue, yellow and red are a documented common occurrence on the flags and coats of arms in Romanian-inhabited lands as far back as the 14th century.

They were extensively used on the coat of arms and flags of the Moldavian Principality. Some examples include a gonfalon of Dragoș Vodă, flags used by Stephen the Great and Petru Rareș, army flags used during the reign of Ieremia Movilă, voivodal flags of Michael the Brave, Alexandru Ipsilanti, Alexandru Suţu, Mihai Sturdza, Alexandru Ghica.

Upon creating a &quot;Grand Principality of Transylvania&quot; on November 2, 1765, Maria Theresa changed the Transylvanian coat of arms to a design that used red, yellow and blue.

Many Wallachian rulers such as Michael the Brave, Basarab I, Radu Șerban, Mihnea III, Matei Basarab, Scarlat Ghica, Alexandros Soutzos, John George Caradja used coats of arms and flags or ensigns in blue, yellow or red.

Contemporary descriptions and later reconstructions indicate that the flag of Wallachia during Michael the Brave&#x27;s reign was made of damask, originally yellow-white but later faded to white. It featured a black eagle on a green juniper branch, with a cross in its beak.

During the 1970s and 1980s, with protochronism receiving official endorsement, it was claimed that red, yellow and blue were found on 16th-century royal grants issued by Michael the Brave, as well as on his shields and banners.

===First use of the colors for self-determination===

During the Wallachian uprising of 1821, Tudor Vladimirescu commissioned a revolutionary flag depicting the New Testament Holy Trinity, Saint George, Saint Tiron and the Wallachian eagle. The blue, yellow and red are present on the vestments of the saints as well as three tassels attached to the pole.

Historiographers consider this one of the earliest instances of the three colors being used deliberately together in the context of Romanian self-determination, with the meaning &quot;Liberty (sky-blue), Justice (field yellow), Fraternity (blood red)&quot;.

The first documented use of a tricolour took place in Wallachia in 1834, when the reforming &quot;domnitor&quot; Alexandru II Ghica submitted naval and military flag designs for the approval of Sultan Mahmud II. Included among them was a &quot;flag with a red, blue and yellow face, also having stars and a bird&#x27;s head in the middle&quot;. Soon, the order of colors was changed, with yellow appearing in the center.

===The 1848 Revolution===

In April 1848, the flag adopted by the revolutionaries was initially a blue-yellow-red tricolor (with blue above, in line with the meaning &quot;Liberty, Justice, Fraternity&quot;). Already on 26 April, according to &quot;Gazeta de Transilvania&quot;, Romanian students in Paris were hailing the new government with a blue, gold and red flag, &quot;as a symbol of union between Moldavians and Muntenians&quot;.

Decree no. 1 of 14/26 June 1848 of the provisional government mentioned that &quot;the National Flag will bear three colours: blue, yellow, red&quot;, emblazoned with the words &quot;DPEПTATE ФPЪЦIE&quot; (&quot;Dreptate, Frăție&quot; or &quot;Justice, Fraternity&quot;). It differed from earlier tricolors in that the blue stripe was on top, the princely monogram was eliminated from the corners, as was the crown atop the eagle at the end of the flagpole, while a motto was now present.

Later on, Decree no. 252 of 13/25 July 1848, issued specifically because &quot;it has not been understood [yet] how the national flags should be designed&quot;, defined the flag as three &quot;vertical&quot; stripes, possibly influenced by the French model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Năsturel 1900/1901, p. 255&quot;&gt;Năsturel (1900/1901), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; The shades were &quot;dark blue, light yellow and carmine red&quot;; as for order, &quot;near the wood comes blue, then yellow and then red fluttering&quot;.

St. Luke’s Church, built in 1782-1791 in Sibiu, hosts a Romanian flag with vertical stripes that was flown at the national assemblies at Blaj on Câmpia Libertății during the Revolution. The flag&#x27;s colors and the icon painted in the center have faded. The flag was hidden in order to avoid being taken or destroyed by the Communist regime and subsequently lost, then rediscovered in 2014.

Petre Vasiliu-Năsturel observes that from a heraldic point of view, on the French as well as the revolutionary Wallachian flag, the middle stripe represents a heraldic metal (argent and or respectively), thus, the two flags could be related. Other historians believe that the tricolour was not an imitation of the French flag, instead embodying an old Romanian tradition. This theory is supported by a note from the revolutionary minister of foreign affairs to Emin Pasha: &quot;the colors of the band that we, the leaders, wear, as well as all our followers, are not of modern origin. We have had our flags since an earlier time. When we received the tricolor insignia and bands we did not follow the spirit of imitation or fashion&quot;. The same minister assured the extraordinary envoy of the Porte, Suleiman Pasha, that the flag&#x27;s three colours had existed &quot;for a long time; our ancestors bore them on their standard and their flags. So they are not a borrowing or an imitation from the present or a threat for the future&quot;.

After the revolution was quelled, the old flags were restored and the revolutionaries punished for having worn the tricolor.

===United Principalities of Romania===

From 1859 until 1866, the United Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia had a red-yellow-blue Romanian tricolor, with horizontal stripes, as national flag.

The flag was described in &quot;Almanahul român din 1866&quot; as: &quot;a tricolor flag, divided in three stripes, red, yellow and blue and laid out horizontally: red above, blue below and yellow in the middle&quot;.

Although the Ottoman Empire did not allow the United Principalities to have their own symbols, the new flag gained a degree of international recognition. Relating prince Cuza&#x27;s May–June 1864 journey to Constantinople, doctor Carol Davila observed: &quot;The Romanian flag was raised on the great mast, the Sultan&#x27;s kayaks awaited us, the guard was armed, the Grand Vizier at the door... The Prince, quiet, dignified, concise in his speech, spent 20 minutes with the Sultan, who then came to review us… Once again, the Grand Vizier led the Prince to the main gate and we returned to the Europe Palace, the Romanian flag still fluttering on the mast...&quot;.

Article 124 of the 1866 Constitution of Romania provided that &quot;the colors of the United Principalities will be Blue, Yellow and Red&quot;. The order and placement of the colors were decided by the Assembly of Deputies in its session of 26 March 1867. Thus, following a proposal by Nicolae Golescu, they were placed just as in 1848: vertically and in the following order: blue hoist, yellow in the middle and red fly.

The country&#x27;s coat of arms was placed only on army and princely flags, in the center; civilian flags remained without a coat of arms. The same distinction was made between flags of the Navy and those of the civil and merchant ships.

The rapporteur Mihail Kogălniceanu, who also conveyed the opinion of Cezar Bolliac, Dimitrie Brătianu, Constantin Grigorescu, Ion Leca, Nicolae Golescu and Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino, said: &quot;The tricolor flag as it is today is not (as the minister claims) the flag of the United Principalities. It is much more: it is itself the flag of the Romanian nation in all lands inhabited by Romanians&quot;.

The &quot;Law for modifying the country&#x27;s arms&quot; of 11/23 March 1872 did not change these provisions, only the design of the coat of arms.

===Socialist and Communist era===

On 30 December 1947 Romania was proclaimed a socialist people&#x27;s republic and all the ex-kingdom&#x27;s symbols were outlawed, including the royal coat of arms and the tricolor flags that showed it.

The flag retained its colors and characteristics, the only difference being that it now included a redesigned coat of arms placed in the middle on the gold band, featuring industrial and agricultural symbolism.

It was also during this era that the 2:3 proportion was regulated by law for the first time.

The national anthem between 1977 and 1990 was a modified version of a patriotic song that gave the color meanings as &quot;heart&#x27;s fire&quot; (red), &quot;golden future&quot; (yellow) and &quot;faith&quot; (blue), but the Communist version stripped the original references and left only &quot;red, yellow and blue&quot;.

Shown here is the last and most long-lived version of the flag, which was in use for 24 years.

===The 1989 Revolution===

On 20 December 1989, during the revolution at Timișoara, the protesters were waving flags with the Communist coat of arms cut out of the middle.

The coat of arms in use at the time was perceived as a symbol of Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s dictatorship and of the Communist era. These flags were called &quot;the flag with the hole&quot; (&quot;drapelul cu gaură&quot;).

Such flags continue to be seen occasionally during contemporary mass protests, particularly those conducted in reaction to Government misconduct.

The Communist flag would officially be replaced in the immediate wake of the Revolution, on 27 December 1989, by the National Salvation Front with the 1867 version of the simple tricolor, which remains in use today.

==Flag protocol==
===Legislation===

Law no. 75/1994 establishes the protocol for the flag of Romania. Its provisions are extended by the Governmental Decision no. 1157/2001 which approves the Regulations regarding the display of the Romanian flag, the singing of the national anthem and the use of insignia containing the Romanian coat of arms. Protocol for military flags and standards is fixed by internal regulation. The law contains the following provisions:

The flag of Romania is always to be hoisted on the buildings and in the headquarters of public authorities and institutions, at the headquarters of political parties, unions, of educational and cultural institutions, on border crossings and in international airports. As ensign, it is permanently hoisted on ships of any kind and other vessels that navigate under the Romanian flag. According to customary protocol, the flag of Romania is hoisted at the headquarters of diplomatic missions and consular offices of Romania, as well as at the residences of the chiefs of diplomatic missions and consular offices. Likewise, the flag of Romania is used as a standard on vehicles transporting chiefs of Romanian diplomatic missions and consular offices, in their official travels, according to the same customs.

Temporarily, on the national day of Romania and other national holidays, the flag of Romania may be hoisted in public places decided upon by the local authorities; and for official festivals and ceremonies with a local, national and international character, in the locations where these take place. Likewise, it must be raised for official visits undertaken in Romania by heads of state and of government, as well as by high political personalities representing the principal international intergovernmental bodies, at airports, rail stations, ports and on their various routes. The flag is also hoisted at sporting competitions, at stadiums and other sporting grounds, and during election campaigns, at the headquarters of electoral commissions and polling stations. During military ceremonies, the flag is hoisted according to military regulations.

The flag of Romania may be raised without restrictions by individuals at their domicile or residence, or by legal entities at their headquarters.

The Government is the only official body that fixes days of national mourning, on which the flag of Romania is lowered at half-staff.

The flags of other states may be hoisted on Romanian territory only together with the national flag and only on the occasion of visits with an official state character, international festivities and meetings, on official buildings and in public places specified in Law no. 75/1994. In such cases, the flag of Romania is hoisted in the place of honor, that is in the center, if the number of flags is odd, or to the right of the flag with which it occupies the center if the number of flags is even. In such cases, all flags must have the same dimensions (but not proportions, which are fixed by each respective country).

The flag of Europe is raised next to the flag of Romania, to the left of the latter.

The raising of the flag of Romania at events that take place under the aegis of international organizations is done according to international regulations and customs.

The military colors are removed from its display case for the solemn occasion of its presentation, at the ceremony for taking the military oath, at parades of troops and reviews on the front, at the giving or taking of command by the respective unit, at the granting of military honors during military funerals, or on other occasions if required.

When in formation and standing, the color bearer keeps the military colors near his foot, holding his right hand down on the rod and his left hand on the rod, at his chest level. The rod&#x27;s low end must be in front of his right foot. When saluting from this position, the military colors are bowed at horizontal for the Romanian president and other heads of state and at 45 degrees for the other civil and military staff. When marching, the color bearer holds the military colors vertically. If the unit is walking more than 100 m, the rod is introduced inside the scarf&#x27;s muff. When traveling by vehicle, the color bearer with the military color stands inside the unit commander&#x27;s car. During the march, the color bearer salutes by bowing the military colors at 45 degrees, regardless the person. When two military units cross each other (either one or both of them are marching in formation) the military colors are bowed for salute at 45 degrees. In case of raining, snowing or strong winds, the military colors are protected by a transparent plastic cover.

The ensign of a Navy vessel must be raised daily on the stern flagpole at 8 a.m., and on holidays at 9 a.m. If the vessel is in motion, the ensign remains raised permanently where the boom meets the mast. Usually, the hoisting of a vessel&#x27;s ensign takes place in the presence of the entire crew, which is not the case at the lowering, daily at sunset.

===Penalties===
According to Governmental Decision no. 1157/2001, which details the rules of hoisting the flag of Romania, citizens must show respect to the Romanian flag and never offend it.

The hoisting of a Romanian flag of another shape, dimension, model or color than those regulated by law, or having an improper condition, is a violation and is punishable with a fine of between 500 and 1500 lei (US$120–362)

Not raising the national flag by public authorities and institutions, or in the mandatory situations stated by the law, the improper hoisting of the flag and the hoisting of the flag of another country outside the situations regulated by law, or with improper dimensions, is a violation and is punishable with a fine of between 2500 and 5000 lei. (US$604–1,208)
The violations are ascertained and sanctioned by mandataries of the minister of public administration, by the prefect or his mandataries, and are applied to the director of the public authority or institution, to the mayor, to the president of the county&#x27;s council, or to the private individual or juridical person that committed the violations.

Until 2011, article 236 of the Penal Code of Romania stated that any display of contempt against the symbols of Romania was punishable by detention between 6 months and 3 years in prison. Article 344 of the same Penal Code provided that, in times of war, lowering the vessel&#x27;s ensign during a battle in order to serve the enemy&#x27;s cause is punishable by life in prison or detention between 15 and 25 years in prison and civil penalties. A new penal code adopted that year eliminates the provisions of article 236 and reduces the punishment provided by article 344 (renamed article 420) to between 10 and 20 years&#x27; imprisonment coupled with civil penalties.

==Flag Day==
Law no. 96 of 20 May 1998 proclaimed 26 June as the Day of the National Flag of Romania. It was on this day in 1848 that Decree no. 1 of the Wallachian Provisional Government was issued, making the red-yellow-blue tricolor the national flag.

On Flag Day, public authorities and other state institutions are obliged by law to organize cultural/educational programs and events, with a patriotic or scientific character, devoted to Romanian history, as well as specific military ceremonies, organized within units of the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of the Internal Affairs.

==Similar flags==

The state flag of Chad is extremely similar to the point it has caused some amount of international discussion. In 2004, Chad asked the United Nations to examine the issue. However, then-president of Romania Ion Iliescu announced that there would be no changes to the flag.

The flag of Moldova is inspired by the Romanian tricolour except that it has a 1:2 ratio, slightly different colors and the Moldovan coat of arms in the middle.

==Other official flags of Romania==
===Governmental flags===

The publication &quot;Album des pavillons nationaux et des marques distinctives&quot; (2000) indicates that the flag of the president of Romania is a square tricolor with a white edge and a blue border. It is decorated on all sides with fringes of golden thread and, in the corners, tassels of the same material. The flag of the prime minister is similar to the one of the president, except that its border is yellow and it lacks fringes and tassels. The flag of the minister of national defense is almost identical to its interwar predecessor, being a square tricolor with the letter &quot;M&quot; written in white in the middle of the blue stripe. The Pilot ensign represents the national flag with a thick white border.

===Military colours and ensigns===
According to the Romanian General Staff, &quot;The military colours are the symbol of military honour, bravery and glory. They evoke the past struggle of the Romanian people for national liberty and the traditions of unity, reminding each soldier of his sacred duty to serve the Fatherland with trust, and to defend at all costs the unity, sovereignty and independence of Romania&quot;.

The military colours are granted to military units by presidential decree, on the advice of the minister of national defence, the minister of internal affairs or the director of the Romanian Intelligence Service. According to the Ministry of National Defence, the complete description of this military insignia is as follows:

The military colours of Romania are made of double silk cloth and have dimensions of 100 × 66 cm (2:3 ratio). The canvas has the colours of the Romanian flag and its obverse is identical with the reverse. The national coat of arms, measuring 29 × 21.5 cm, is applied in the middle of the yellow stripe, 18 cm above its base. In each corner, 5 cm from the edge of the canvas, is sewed a wreath of oak leaves, which surrounds the weapon signs, all of golden thread:
* two crossed lands for land forces
* a helicopter blade juxtaposed over a pair of paper in downward flight, a radar and a crossed rocket and telescope for aerial forces
* an anchor for naval forces.
* the letter J in a rhombus over two crossed swords for gendarmerie units
* the emblem of the Romanian Intelligence Service for its units

The three sides of the flag not attached to the pole are decorated with fringes of golden thread (5–7 cm long) and tassels of the same material (10–12 cm long) hang from the corners of the fly. The flag is attached to the pole by an antioxidant metal rod 70 cm long.

The pole, of brown wood, is 240 cm high and 3.5 cm in diameter. A brass cylinder is at the base, 4 cm long and closed on the bottom. The rod is attached to the pole by a brass ring, gilt on its lower part, and a 6 cm high cylindrical protective tube of the same material and gilt on its upper part. The ring (3.2 cm high) is inscribed with the name of the unit. Another brass cylinder is placed on the tip of the pole, 6 cm long and of brass. The eagle, of gilt copper, sheet, 15 cm high and 11.5 cm wide, is placed over this. Looking rightward, the eagle&#x27;s wings are pointed downward and it holds the thunderbolts of Jupiter in its talons. It is placed on a parallelepipedic support of the same metal (10 × 3.5 × 2 cm), which has a 3.4 cm high ornament on its lower part. The support is screwed onto the brass cylinder and has inscribed into the front the motto &quot;Onoare și Patrie&quot; (&quot;Honour and Fatherland&quot;). The name of the respective unit is engraved into the reverse.

Other features of the military colours are a tie for attaching decorations, six sashes for the troops in the flag&#x27;s guard and a protective cover of impermeable fabric.

The military colours of navy vessels are identical to their ensign. The ensign is in turn identical to the national flag, being made of ordinary canvas in various dimensions, according to the ship&#x27;s rank, size and place of hoisting.

At the beginning of the 2000s, four identifying flags were selected for the armed forces:
* The flag of the General Staff is light yellow. One side shows the coat of arms of the General Staff and four gold stars, with the symbols of the General Staff and the land, naval and air forces in the corners. On the reverse are the Prophet Elijah, the Virgin Mary and Saint George, patrons of the air force, navy and land forces respectively.
* The flag of the General Staff of the Land Forces is red. One side shows the coat of arms of the Staff, four gold stars, and the symbol of the land forces in the corners. The reverse depicts Saint George.
* The flag of the General Staff of the Air Force is light blue. One side shows the coat of arms of the Staff, four gold stars, and the symbol of the air force in the corners. The reverse depicts the Prophet Elijah.
* The flag of the General Staff of the Navy is sea blue. One side shows the coat of arms of the Staff, four gold stars, and the symbol of the navy in the corners. The reverse depicts the Virgin Mary.

===Naval jack and rank flags===

Between 1995 and 1998, the Romanian naval jack was similar to the rank flags of Navy officers. Afterward, it was replaced with a 1:1 national flag with two crossed white anchors in the center of the blue stripe, similarly to the naval jack used between 1966 and 1989.

The standard of the Chief of the General Staff is a square Romanian tricolor with four white stars, one beneath the other, in the center of the blue stripe. It can be used both as car standard or as rank flag on Navy vessels.

The ships&#x27; pennant is a horizontal piece of canvas in the shape of an isosceles triangle, with a 1:10 ratio, on which is printed the Romanian national tricolor.

The &quot;Album des pavillons nationaux et des marques distinctives&quot; (2000) also depicts the rank flags of navy officers. These flags indicate that a commanding or leadership officer is on board. But one exception, they are rectangular light blue 2:3 canvases, on which are found a blue anchor, the Romanian flag in the canton and a number of five-pointed yellow stars, according to rank: four for the Chief of the Naval Forces Staff, three for the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff, two for fleet or flotilla Commander and one for a major Naval unit Commander. The flag of a regular Navy unit Commander is, by exception, triangular and it lacks stars. 

==Former flags used by the Socialist Republic of Romania==
===Flags of the president, prime minister and minister of the armed forces===

The president of the RSR (until 1974 the president of the Council of State) and the prime minister had their own standard, a square Romanian tricolor with a white edge and a red border beyond that; the RSR&#x27;s coat of arms was in the center, the height of the tricolor&#x27;s width. The standard was decorated with fringes of golden thread and tassels of the same material. The flag of the minister of the armed forces of the RSR consisted of a white pennant in a 1:2 ratio. The flag of the RSR was placed in the canton, while two red five-pointed stars occupied the fly.
===Military colours===

On 28 July 1950 the Great National Assembly issued Decree nr. 189 for the establishment of the military colors of the Romanian People&#x27;s Army, as well as standards for the Military Air Force and the Naval Forces. Article 2 defined the units’ military colors as follows: “three silk stripes colored red, yellow and blue, arranged vertically with blue situated near the flagpole. On the edges the flag has golden metal fringes, while the fly corners each have a tassel of the same wire. On the side oriented from the flagpole to the right, in the middle, is placed the coat of arms of the R. P. R. in natural colors. Above the coat of arms, on the same side, in an arched line, is written with letters of golden wire: ‘Pentru Patria noastră’ (‘For our Fatherland’). On the other side and in the middle of the flag, the emblem worn on the uniforms of officers of the Armed Forces of the R. P. R. is applied. Under the emblem is written straight, with letters of golden wire, the unit&#x27;s name. The flagpole ends in an ogive-shaped tip, within which is found a five-pointed star, in the center of which are written the initials RPR”. The law&#x27;s annex also specified the dimensions of the flag (100 centimeter long by 60 centimeter wide), the coat of arms and the emblem (20 centimeter high), the fringes (5 centimeter long), the flagpole (250 centimeter long) and of the ogive (15 centimeter long by 7 centimeter wide).

Article 3 described the Air Force ensign: &quot;it is made of sky-blue silk. The ensign is rectangular, with each face having applied to it 18 red silk strips in the form of sunrays. On the edges, the ensign has fringes and tassels the same as on the military colors. In the middle of the face oriented from the flagpole to the right is affixed the coat of arms of the R. P. R., while in the middle of the other face is affixed the emblem worn on the uniforms of officers belonging to the Armed Forces of the R. P. R. The coat of arms of the R. P. R., the emblem and the inscriptions are identical to those of the military colors&quot;. The annex specified the dimensions of the ensign and the decorative elements, which were identical to those of the military colors. In the center of the flag, a ray had an angle of 10˚. Also specified was the shade of blue to be used on the flag: &quot;iron blue&quot;.
Military colors and standards adopted during the Romanian People&#x27;s Republic were modified or completely changed by Decree nr. 106 of 24 December 1966 regarding regulations for granting the military colors of units and large units from all military branches, modifying the display protocol for ensigns and pennants of navy and Coast Guard ships, establishing a distinctive emblem and commanders’ emblems for navy and Coast Guard vessels, a jack for navy ships and a distinctive ensign for Coast Guard ships.

Article 4 described the Romanian Navy&#x27;s ensign thus: &quot;made of two pieces of white and blue silk, rectangular, laid horizontally, the blue one, beneath, having a width of 20 centimeter, while the white one, above, having a width of 40 centimeter. The coat of arms of the R. P. R. is applied to the middle of the white surface on the face oriented from the flagpole to the right, while on the other face, also in the middle of the while surface, the emblem worn on the uniforms of officers belonging to the Armed Forces of the R. P. R. is applied. The coat of arms, the emblem, the inscriptions, the fringes and the tassels are the same as those of the military colors&quot;. The annex specified the flag&#x27;s dimensions (also 100 × 60 centimeter) and those of the coat of arms (also 20 centimeter high), as well as its distance to the edges of the white strip (11 centimeter above and 9 centimeter below). The words “Pentru Patria noastră” (“For our Fatherland”) were found on the white strip above the coat of arms, while &quot;Republica Populară Română&quot; and the unit&#x27;s name were placed in the middle of the blue strip.
Decree nr. 190 of 1950, published in the same issue of &quot;Buletinul Oficial&quot;, established the design of Army soldiers’, officers’ and generals’ emblems. The officers’ emblem was a five-pointed, red-enamelled star 34 centimeter in diameter. In the center were two circles: the first, with a radius of 15 centimeter, was enamelled yellow and touched the star&#x27;s interior angles, while the second, which had a radius of 11 centimeter, was enamelled blue and in the center had the golden initials “R. P. R.”

The following year, Decree nr. 124 of 20 July 1951 for the modification of art. 4 of Decree nr. 189 altered the Navy&#x27;s ensign. The new regulation provided for three separate insignia: the flag of Navy land units, the flag of Navy ships and the flag of Coast Guard ships.

The Navy&#x27;s land units had as their flag &quot;two pieces of silk, colored white and blue, rectangular in shape, laid horizontally, the blue piece below, and the white one above. In the middle of the white area facing from the flagpole to the right is affixed the coat of arms of the Romanian People’s Republic, in natural colors, while on the other side, also in the middle of the white area, is affixed the symbol worn on the uniforms of officers belonging to the Armed Forces of the Romanian People’s Republic. The coat of arms, emblem, inscriptions, fringes and tassels are the same as those of the military colors described in article 2 [of Decree nr. 189 of 1950]&quot;. According to this decree&#x27;s annex, the flag&#x27;s dimensions were 100 × 60 centimeter, the blue strip being 20 centimeter wide and the white 40 centimeter, the coat of arms was 20 centimeter high and it was 11 centimeter away from the top edge of the white strip and 9 centimeter away from the bottom.
===Naval ships===
Navy ships had an ensign consisting of a &quot;piece of ordinary rectangular canvas, with the colors white and blue printed on either side, in two stripes laid horizontally, the blue one below. The coat of arms of the Romanian People’s Republic, in natural colors, is affixed to the middle of the white area on both sides. The ensign does not have fringes or tassels [and] is supplied with cords and a mechanism for raising it on the stern beam or the mast&quot;. The ensign for Coast Guard ships was different from that of Navy ships only in the color of the lower stripe—Coast Guard green. The law&#x27;s annex described proportions for the ensign&#x27;s various elements; the actual dimensions were to be fixed by the Armed Forces Ministry and the Interior Ministry depending on the ship&#x27;s size and the place where the ensign was raised. Thus, the flag was 0.6 times as wide as it was long, being divided thus: colored stripe and white stripe. The coat of arms was to be the height of the flag&#x27;s width, being placed of this width away from the edges of the white stripe.

Between 1953 and 1964, due to a spelling reform, the country&#x27;s name was written on flags as &quot;Romînia&quot; and not &quot;România&quot;.

Decree nr. 93 of 17 April 1954 for the modification of art. 4 of Decree nr. 189 established new vexillological devices: the ensign of auxiliary Navy ships (the previous ensign continuing in use only for battleships) and pennants for Navy battleships, auxiliary Navy ships and Coast Guard vessels.

The ensign of auxiliary Navy ships was made of an &quot;ordinary canvas, rectangular and blue. In the upper corner on the side where it attaches to the cord, it has imprinted on both sides the colors white and light blue, in two horizontal stripes, the white one above. To the middle of the white area, on both sides, is affixed the coat of arms of the Romanian People’s Republic, in natural colors&quot;. This ensign&#x27;s proportions were indicated in the annex. It was 0.6 times as wide as it was long: the upper left part of the standard was similar in proportion to the basic elements of the battleship standard, while its dimensions were 0.5 of the flag&#x27;s length and 0.3 of its width.

Navy and Coast Guard vessels had a masthead pennant made of an “ordinary rectangular canvas, red for Navy battleships, blue for auxiliary Navy ships and green for Coast Guard ships [the width is 0.6 of the length]. At the edge near the cord, the colors white and light blue are imprinted on both sides, in two horizontal stripes, for Navy ships and white and light green on Coast Guard ships [in proportions of and respectively; this area’s length is 0.075 that of the pennant’s length]. In both cases white shall be above. The coat of arms of the Romanian People’s Republic, in natural colors is affixed to the middle of the white area on both sides [with a height of the pennant’s width and located and of this width away from the edges of the white area]. At the other end, the pennant is cut in the form of a sharp angle pointing inward [the cut was 1.2 times as deep as the length of the white and colored area near the cord]. The ships’ pennany is provided with a cord and a mechanism for being raised on a tall mast”. The proportions of the pennant&#x27;s component elements were indicated in the annex, with the actual dimensions remaining to be decided by the Armed Forces Ministry and the Interior Ministry.
=== Military colours, 1968 pattern ===

All the flags of the former 1950 pattern were replaced altogether in 1967 with a new national colours pattern for the Armed Forces and other uniformed services, wherein the emblem of the Socialist Republic was used. In the attached commentary, it was mentioned that the previous regulations were no longer valid, primarily because:

*military colors of naval land units no longer featured the national flag colors, but only white and blue;
*ensigns and pennants of the Navy and Coast Guard ships no longer featured the national flag colors and thus—even at close distances—Romanian ships could be confused with those of other nations;
*the air force flag was no longer necessary, as it did not correspond to the new organization of the air force within the armed forces.
The new design was a return to the Naval Forces and Air Force of the national flag design as the basis for unit colors, which were retained by the Land Forces.

Article 2 of the decree provided that “the military colors are granted by the Council of State of the Romanian Socialist Republic to units and large units from all military branches from the Armed Forces Ministry, as well as to units from the Internal Affairs Ministry, at their founding. The flag is granted, depending on the case, at the initiative of the armed forces minister or the internal affairs minister. The granting of the flag is done in the name of the Council of State of the Romanian Socialist Republic by a representative of the armed forces, respectively of the internal affairs minister”. The first clause of this article was modified thus by Decree nr. 150 of 19 June 1974 regarding the modification of certain laws and decrees: “the flag is granted by presidential decree to units and large units of all military branches from the Armed Forces Ministry, as well as to units from the Internal Affairs Ministry, at their founding”.

Ensigns of navy and Coast Guard vessels consisted of the military colors of the respective units.

The pennant was the device that indicated a ship was armed and commanded by a navy officer. It consisted of an “ordinary canvas, in the shape of an isosceles triangle, with the base toward the attaching mechanism and with the flag colors and coat of arms of the Romanian Socialist Republic printed on both sides”.

The jack was “an ordinary square canvas, having printed on both sides the flag colors and coat of arms of the Romanian Socialist Republic. Two crossed white anchors of the same size as the coat of arms are affixed to the blue area”.

The distinctive ensign of Coast Guard vessels consisted of “an ordinary white rectangular canvas, with the half near the attaching mechanism green, upon which is affixed a white anchor”.

The dimensions of these insignia, as well as their manner of use, were left to the Armed Forces Ministry to decide by regulation.

===Naval rank flags===
Decree nr. 1016 of 1966 created a legal framework for the establishment of distinctive rank flags and commanders’ rank flags, which were raised on Navy and Coast Guard ships, in accordance with the services’ sailing regulations.

A distinctive rank flag was raised when “the general secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party, the president of the Council of State of the Romanian Socialist Republic or the president of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian Socialist Republic [was] on an official visit” aboard ship.

The commanders’ rank flag was flown in similar situations for: “the minister of the armed forces of the Romanian Socialist Republic, the commander of the navy, the commander of a large unit of ships of the commander of a group of ships temporarily constituted”.

The form, colors and dimensions of the flags remained to be fixed by regulation.

===Patriotic Guards===
Decree nr. 90 of 27 April 1977 regarding the establishment of military colors for the patriotic guards and the regulation of its bestowment created a special symbol for units of the Patriotic Guards. This was similar to military colors of military units, with the exception of the inscription on the flag&#x27;s reverse side — “Gărzile patriotice” — in an arched line above the coat of arms, and the administrative unit in which the formation was located (the municipality or county), in a straight line beneath the coat of arms. Its dimensions were indicated in the annex: the canvas was 100 centimeter long and 66 centimeter wide, the text was 6 centimeter high, the fringes 5 centimeter long, the flagpole 240 centimeter long and 4 centimeter wide, while the ogive at the end of the flagpole was 15 centimeter high. According to the Decree, the flag was granted to a unit by commanders of county-level or Bucharest-level Patriotic Guards, or by representatives of the General Staff of the Patriotic Guards from the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party, following a presidential decree for this purpose. Patriotic Guards that distinguished themselves in training exercises for national defense and that comprised at least 2000 fighters were eligible to receive their unit flags.

<text>The Dacians (; ; ) were the ancient Indo-European inhabitants of the cultural region of Dacia, located in the area near the Carpathian Mountains and west of the Black Sea. They are often considered a subgroup of the Thracians. This area includes mainly the present-day countries of Romania and Moldova, as well as parts of Ukraine, Eastern Serbia, Northern Bulgaria, Slovakia, Hungary and Southern Poland. The Dacians and the related Getae spoke the Dacian language, which has a debated relationship with the neighbouring Thracian language and may be a subgroup of it. Dacians were somewhat culturally influenced by the neighbouring Scythians and by the Celtic invaders of the 4th century BC.

==Name and etymology==

===Name===

The Dacians were known as &quot;Geta&quot; (plural &quot;Getae&quot;) in Ancient Greek writings, and as &quot;Dacus&quot; (plural &quot;Daci&quot;) or &quot;Getae&quot; in Roman documents, but also as &quot;Dagae&quot; and &quot;Gaete&quot; as depicted on the late Roman map &quot;Tabula Peutingeriana&quot;. It was Herodotus who first used the ethnonym &quot;Getae&quot; in his &quot;Histories&quot;. In Greek and Latin, in the writings of Julius Caesar, Strabo, and Pliny the Elder, the people became known as &#x27;the Dacians&#x27;. Getae and Dacians were interchangeable terms, or used with some confusion by the Greeks. Latin poets often used the name &quot;Getae&quot;. Vergil called them &quot;Getae&quot; four times, and &quot;Daci&quot; once, Lucian &quot;Getae&quot; three times and &quot;Daci&quot; twice, Horace named them &quot;Getae&quot; twice and &quot;Daci&quot; five times, while Juvenal one time &quot;Getae&quot; and two times &quot;Daci&quot;. In AD 113, Hadrian used the poetic term &quot;Getae&quot; for the Dacians. Modern historians prefer to use the name &quot;Geto-Dacians&quot;. Strabo describes the Getae and Dacians as distinct but cognate tribes. This distinction refers to the regions they occupied. Strabo and Pliny the Elder also state that Getae and Dacians spoke the same language.

By contrast, the name of &quot;Dacians&quot;, whatever the origin of the name, was used by the more western tribes who adjoined the Pannonians and therefore first became known to the Romans. According to Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot;, the original name of the Dacians was &quot;&quot;Daoi&quot;. The name Daoi (one of the ancient Geto-Dacian tribes) was certainly adopted by foreign observers to designate all the inhabitants of the countries north of Danube that had not yet been conquered by Greece or Rome.

The ethnographic name &quot;Daci&quot; is found under various forms within ancient sources. Greeks used the forms &quot;Dakoi&quot;&quot; (Strabo, Dio Cassius, and Dioscorides) and &quot;Daoi&quot; (singular Daos). The form &quot;Daoi&quot; was frequently used according to Stephan of Byzantium.

Latins used the forms &quot;Davus&quot;, &quot;Dacus&quot;, and a derived form &quot;Dacisci&quot; (Vopiscus and inscriptions).

There are similarities between the ethnonyms of the Dacians and those of Dahae (Greek &quot;Dáoi&quot;, &quot;Dáai&quot;, &quot;Dai&quot;, &quot;Dasai&quot;; Latin &quot;Dahae&quot;, &quot;Daci&quot;), an Indo-European people located east of the Caspian Sea, until the 1st millennium BC. Scholars have suggested that there were links between the two peoples since ancient times. The historian David Gordon White has, moreover, stated that the &quot;Dacians ... appear to be related to the Dahae&quot;. (Likewise White and other scholars also believe that the names Dacii and Dahae may also have a shared etymology – see the section following for further details.)

By the end of the first century AD, all the inhabitants of the lands which now form Romania were known to the Romans as Daci, with the exception of some Celtic and Germanic tribes who infiltrated from the west, and Sarmatian and related people from the east.

===Etymology===
The name &quot;Daci&quot;, or &quot;Dacians&quot; is a collective ethnonym. Dio Cassius reported that the Dacians themselves used that name, and the Romans so called them, while the Greeks called them Getae. Opinions on the origins of the name &quot;Daci&quot; are divided. Some scholars consider it to originate in the Indo-European *&quot;dha-k&quot;-, with the stem *&quot;dhe&quot;- &#x27;to put, to place&#x27;, while others think that the name &quot;Daci&quot; originates in *&quot;daca&quot; &#x27;knife, dagger&#x27; or in a word similar to &quot;dáos,&quot; meaning &#x27;wolf&#x27; in the related language of the Phrygians.&quot;&quot;

One hypothesis is that the name &quot;Getae&quot; originates in Indo-European *&quot;guet-&quot; &#x27;to utter, to talk&#x27;. Another hypothesis is that &quot;Getae&quot; and &quot;Daci&quot; are the Iranian names of two Iranian-speaking Scythian groups that had been assimilated into the larger Thracian-speaking population of the later &quot;Dacia.&quot;

====Early history of etymological approaches====
In the 1st century AD, Strabo suggested that its stem formed a name previously borne by slaves: Greek Daos, Latin Davus (-k- is a known suffix in Indo-European ethnic names). In the 18th century, Grimm proposed the Gothic &quot;dags&quot; or &quot;day&quot; that would give the meaning of &quot;light, brilliant&quot;. Yet &quot;dags&quot; belongs to the Sanskrit word-root &quot;dah-&quot;, and a derivation from &quot;Dah&quot; to &quot;Daci&quot; is difficult. In the 19th century, Tomaschek (1883) proposed the form &quot;Dak&quot;, meaning &quot;those who understand and can speak&quot;, by considering &quot;Dak&quot; as a derivation of the root &quot;da&quot; (&quot;k&quot; being a suffix); cf. Sanskrit &quot;dasa&quot;, Bactrian &quot;daonha&quot;. Tomaschek also proposed the form &quot;Davus&quot;, meaning &quot;members of the clan/countryman&quot; cf. Bactrian &quot;daqyu&quot;, &quot;danhu&quot; &quot;canton&quot;.

====Modern theories====
Since the 19th century, many scholars have proposed an etymological link between the endonym of the Dacians and wolves.
* A possible connection with the Phrygians was proposed by Dimitar Dechev (in a work not published until 1957). The Phrygian language word &quot;daos&quot; meant &quot;wolf&quot;, and &quot;Daos&quot; was also a Phrygian deity. In later times, Roman auxiliaries recruited from the Dacian area were also known as &quot;Phrygi&quot;. Such a connection was supported by material from Hesychius of Alexandria (5th/6th century), as well as by the 20th century historian Mircea Eliade. 
* The German linguist Paul Kretschmer linked &quot;daos&quot; to wolves via the root &quot;dhau&quot;, meaning to press, to gather, or to strangle – i.e. it was believed that wolves would often use a neck bite to kill their prey.
* Endonyms linked to wolves have been demonstrated or proposed for other Indo-European tribes, including the Luvians, Lycians, Lucanians, Hyrcanians and, in particular, the Dahae (of the south-east Caspian region), who were known in Old Persian as &quot;Daos&quot;. Scholars such as David Gordon White have explicitly linked the endonyms of the Dacians and the Dahae.
* Hungarian linguist and historian Dr. Viktor Padányi writes &quot;By all indications their name comes from the Sumerian &quot;dag, tag&quot; word meaning two handed axe, battle axe.&quot;
* The &quot;Draco&quot;, a standard flown by the Dacians, also prominently featured a wolf head. 
However, according to Romanian historian and archaeologist Alexandru Vulpe, the Dacian etymology explained by &quot;daos&quot; (&quot;wolf&quot;) has little plausibility, as the transformation of &quot;daos&quot; into &quot;dakos&quot; is phonetically unlikely and the &quot;Draco&quot; standard was not unique to Dacians. He thus dismisses it as folk etymology.

Another etymology, linked to the Proto-Indo-European language roots &quot;*dhe-&quot; meaning &quot;to set, place&quot; and &quot;dheua&quot; → &quot;dava&quot; (&quot;settlement&quot;) and &quot;dhe-k&quot; → &quot;daci&quot; is supported by Romanian historian Ioan I. Russu (1967).

===Mythological theories===
Mircea Eliade attempted, in his book &quot;From Zalmoxis to Genghis Khan&quot;, to give a mythological foundation to an alleged special relation between Dacians and the wolves:
* Dacians might have called themselves &quot;wolves&quot; or &quot;ones the same with wolves&quot;, suggesting religious significance.
* Dacians draw their name from a god or a legendary ancestor who appeared as a wolf.
* Dacians had taken their name from a group of fugitive immigrants arrived from other regions or from their own young outlaws, who acted similarly to the wolves circling villages and living from looting. As was the case in other societies, those young members of the community went through an initiation, perhaps up to a year, during which they lived as a &quot;wolf&quot;. Comparatively, Hittite laws referred to fugitive outlaws as &quot;wolves&quot;.
* The existence of a ritual that provides one with the ability to turn into a wolf. Such a transformation may be related either to lycanthropy itself, a widespread phenomenon, but attested especially in the Balkans-Carpathian region, or a ritual imitation of the behavior and appearance of the wolf. Such a ritual was presumably a military initiation, potentially reserved to a secret brotherhood of warriors (or Männerbünde). To become formidable warriors they would assimilate behavior of the wolf, wearing wolf skins during the ritual. Traces related to wolves as a cult or as totems were found in this area since the Neolithic period, including the Vinča culture artifacts: wolf statues and fairly rudimentary figurines representing dancers with a wolf mask. The items could indicate warrior initiation rites, or ceremonies in which young people put on their seasonal wolf masks. The element of unity of beliefs about werewolves and lycanthropy exists in the magical-religious experience of mystical solidarity with the wolf by whatever means used to obtain it. But all have one original myth, a primary event.

==Origins and ethnogenesis==

Evidence of proto-Thracians or proto-Dacians in the prehistoric period depends on the remains of material culture. It is generally proposed that a proto-Dacian or proto-Thracian people developed from a mixture of indigenous peoples and Indo-Europeans from the time of Proto-Indo-European expansion in the Early Bronze Age (3,300–3,000 BC) when the latter, around 1500 BC, conquered the indigenous peoples. The indigenous people were Danubian farmers, and the invading people of the 3rd millennium BC were Kurgan warrior-herders from the Ukrainian and Russian steppes.

Indo-Europeanization was complete by the beginning of the Bronze Age. The people of that time are best described as proto-Thracians, which later developed in the Iron Age into Danubian-Carpathian Geto-Dacians as well as Thracians of the eastern Balkan Peninsula.

Between 15th–12th century BC, the Dacian-Getae culture was influenced by the Bronze Age Tumulus-Urnfield warriors who were on their way through the Balkans to Anatolia.

In the 8th to 7th centuries BC, the migration of the Scythians from the east into the Pontic Steppe pushed westwards and away from the steppes the related Scythic Agathyrsi people who had previously dwelt on the Pontic Steppe around the Lake Maeotis. Following this, the Agathyrsi settled in the territories of present-day Moldova, Transylvania and possibly Oltenia, where they mingled with the indigenous population of Thracian origins. When the Agathyrsi were later completely assimilated by the Geto-Thracian populations;, their fortified settlements became the centres of the Getic groups who would later transform into the Dacian culture; an important part of the Dacian people descended from the Agathyrsi. When the La Tène Celts arrived in the 4th century BC, the Dacians were under the influence of the Scythians.

Alexander the Great attacked the Getae in 335 BC on the lower Danube, but by 300 BC they had formed a state founded on a military democracy, and began a period of conquest. More Celts arrived during the 3rd century BC, and in the 1st century BC the people of Boii tried to conquer some of the Dacian territory on the eastern side of the Teiss river. The Dacians drove the Boii south across the Danube and out of their territory, at which point the Boii abandoned any further plans for invasion.

Some Hungarian historians consider the Dacians and Getae the same as the Scythian tribes of the Dahae, Massagetae, also the exonym Daxia one with Dacia.

==Identity and distribution==

North of the Danube, Dacians occupied a larger territory than Ptolemaic Dacia, stretching between Bohemia in the west and the Dnieper cataracts in the east, and up to the Pripyat, Vistula, and Oder rivers in the north and northwest. In 53 BC, Julius Caesar stated that the Dacian territory was on the eastern border of the Hercynian forest. According to Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot;, written around AD 20, the Getes (Geto-Dacians) bordered the Suevi who lived in the Hercynian Forest, which is somewhere in the vicinity of the river Duria, the present-day Váh (Waag). Dacians lived on both sides of the Danube. According to Strabo, Moesians also lived on both sides of the Danube. According to Agrippa, Dacia was limited by the Baltic Ocean in the North and by the Vistula in the West. The names of the people and settlements confirm Dacia&#x27;s borders as described by Agrippa. Dacian people also lived south of the Danube.

===Linguistic affiliation===


The Dacians and Getae were always considered as Thracians by the ancients (Dio Cassius, Trogus Pompeius, Appian, Strabo and Pliny the Elder), and were both said to speak the same Thracian language. The linguistic affiliation of Dacian is uncertain, since the ancient Indo-European language in question became extinct and left very limited traces, usually in the form of place names, plant names and personal names. Thraco-Dacian (or Thracian and Daco-Mysian) seems to belong to the eastern (satem) group of Indo-European languages. There are two contradictory theories: some scholars (such as Tomaschek 1883; Russu 1967; Solta 1980; Crossland 1982; Vraciu 1980) consider Dacian to be a Thracian language or a dialect thereof. This view is supported by R. G. Solta, who says that Thracian and Dacian are very closely related languages. Other scholars (such as Georgiev 1965, Duridanov 1976) consider that Thracian and Dacian are two different and specific Indo-European languages which cannot be reduced to a common language. Linguists such as Polomé and Katičić expressed reservations about both theories.

The Dacians are generally considered to have been Thracian speakers, representing a cultural continuity from earlier Iron Age communities loosely termed Getic, Since in one interpretation, Dacian is a variety of Thracian, for the reasons of convenience, the generic term ‘Daco-Thracian&quot; is used, with &quot;Dacian&quot; reserved for the language or dialect that was spoken north of Danube, in present-day Romania and eastern Hungary, and &quot;Thracian&quot; for the variety spoken south of the Danube. There is no doubt that the Thracian language was related to the Dacian language which was spoken in what is today Romania, before some of that area was occupied by the Romans. Also, both Thracian and Dacian have one of the main satem characteristic changes of Indo-European language, *k and *g to *s and *z. With regard to the term &quot;Getic&quot; (Getae), even though attempts have been made to distinguish between Dacian and Getic, there seems no compelling reason to disregard the view of the Greek geographer Strabo that the Daci and the Getae, Thracian tribes dwelling north of the Danube (the Daci in the west of the area and the Getae further east), were one and the same people and spoke the same language.

Another variety that has sometimes been recognized is that of Moesian (or Mysian) for the language of an intermediate area immediately to the south of Danube in Serbia, Bulgaria and Romanian Dobruja: this and the dialects north of the Danube have been grouped together as Daco-Moesian. The language of the indigenous population has left hardly any trace in the anthroponymy of Moesia, but the toponymy indicates that the Moesii on the south bank of the Danube, north of the Haemus Mountains, and the Triballi in the valley of the Morava, shared a number of characteristic linguistic features with the Dacii south of the Carpathians and the Getae in the Wallachian plain, which sets them apart from the Thracians though their languages are undoubtedly related.

Dacian culture is mostly followed through Roman sources. Ample evidence suggests that they were a regional power in and around the city of Sarmizegetusa. Sarmizegetusa was their political and spiritual capital. The ruined city lies high in the mountains of central Romania.

Vladimir Georgiev disputes that Dacian and Thracian were closely related for various reasons, most notably that Dacian and Moesian town names commonly end with the suffix &quot;-DAVA&quot;, while towns in Thrace proper (i.e. South of the Balkan mountains) generally end in &quot;-PARA&quot; (see Dacian language). According to Georgiev, the language spoken by the ethnic Dacians should be classified as &quot;Daco-Moesian&quot; and regarded as distinct from Thracian. Georgiev also claimed that names from approximately Roman Dacia and Moesia show different and generally less extensive changes in Indo-European consonants and vowels than those found in Thrace itself. However, the evidence seems to indicate divergence of a Thraco-Dacian language into northern and southern groups of dialects, not so different as to qualify as separate languages. Polomé considers that such lexical differentiation (&quot; -dava&quot; vs. &quot;para&quot;) would, however, be hardly enough evidence to separate Daco-Moesian from Thracian.

===Tribes===
An extensive account of the native tribes in Dacia can be found in the ninth tabula of Europe of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;. The Geography was probably written in the period AD 140–150, but the sources were often earlier; for example, Roman Britain is shown before the building of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in the AD 120s. Ptolemy&#x27;s Geography also contains a physical map probably designed before the Roman conquest, and containing no detailed nomenclature. There are references to the Tabula Peutingeriana, but it appears that the Dacian map of the Tabula was completed after the final triumph of Roman nationality. Ptolemy&#x27;s list includes no fewer than twelve tribes with Geto-Dacian names.

The fifteen tribes of Dacia as named by Ptolemy, starting from the northernmost ones, are as follows. First, the Anartes, the Teurisci and the Coertoboci/Costoboci. To the south of them are the Buredeense (Buri/Burs), the Cotenses/Cotini and then the Albocenses, the Potulatenses and the Sense, while the southernmost were the Saldenses, the Ciaginsi and the Piephigi. To the south of them were Predasenses/Predavenses, the Rhadacenses/Rhatacenses, the Caucoenses (Cauci) and Biephi. Twelve out of these fifteen tribes listed by Ptolemy are ethnic Dacians, and three are Celts: Anarti, Teurisci, and Cotenses. There are also previous brief mentions of other Getae or Dacian tribes on the left and right banks of the Danube, or even in Transylvania, to be added to the list of Ptolemy. Among these other tribes are the Trixae, Crobidae and Appuli.

Some peoples inhabiting the region generally described in Roman times as &quot;Dacia&quot; were not ethnic Dacians. The true Dacians were a people of Thracian descent. German elements (Daco-Germans), Celtic elements (Daco-Celtic) and Iranian elements (Daco-Sarmatian) occupied territories in the north-west and north-east of Dacia. This region covered roughly the same area as modern Romania plus Bessarabia (Republic of Moldova) and eastern Galicia (south-west Ukraine), although Ptolemy places Moldavia and Bessarabia in &quot;Sarmatia Europaea&quot;, rather than &quot;Dacia&quot;. After the Dacian Wars (AD 101–6), the Romans occupied only about half of the wider Dacian region. The Roman province of Dacia covered just western Wallachia as far as the &quot;Limes Transalutanus&quot; (East of the river &quot;Alutus&quot;, or Olt) and Transylvania, as bordered by the Carpathians.

The impact of the Roman conquest on these people is uncertain. One hypothesis was that they were effectively eliminated. An important clue to the character of Dacian casualties is offered by the ancient sources Eutropius and Crito. Both speak about men when they describe the losses suffered by the Dacians in the wars. This suggests that both refer to losses due to fighting, not due to a process of extermination of the whole population. A strong component of the Dacian army, including the Celtic Bastarnae and the Germans, had withdrawn rather than submit to Trajan. Some scenes on Trajan&#x27;s Column represent acts of obedience of the Dacian population, and others show the refugee Dacians returning to their own places. Dacians trying to buy amnesty are depicted on Trajan&#x27;s Column (one offers to Trajan a tray of three gold ingots). Alternatively, a substantial number may have survived in the province, although were probably outnumbered by the Romanised immigrants. Cultural life in Dacia became very mixed and decidedly cosmopolitan because of the colonial communities. The Dacians retained their names and their own ways in the midst of the newcomers, and the region continued to exhibit Dacian characteristics. The Dacians who survived the war are attested as revolting against the Roman domination in Dacia at least twice, in the period of time right after the Dacian Wars, and in a more determined manner in 117 AD. In 158 AD, they revolted again, and were put down by M. Statius Priscus. Some Dacians were apparently expelled from the occupied zone at the end of each of the two Dacian Wars or otherwise emigrated. It is uncertain where these refugees settled. Some of these people might have mingled with the existing ethnic Dacian tribes beyond the Carpathians (the Costoboci and Carpi).

After Trajan&#x27;s conquest of Dacia, there was recurring trouble involving Dacian groups excluded from the Roman province, as finally defined by Hadrian. By the early third century the &quot;Free Dacians&quot;, as they were earlier known, were a significantly troublesome group, then identified as the Carpi, requiring imperial intervention on more than one occasion. In 214 Caracalla dealt with their attacks. Later, Philip the Arab came in person to deal with them; he assumed the triumphal title Carpicus Maximus and inaugurated a new era for the province of Dacia (July 20, 246). Later both Decius and Gallienus assumed the titles Dacicus Maximus. In 272, Aurelian assumed the same title as Philip.

In about 140 AD, Ptolemy lists the names of several tribes residing on the fringes of the Roman Dacia (west, east and north of the Carpathian range), and the ethnic picture seems to be a mixed one. North of the Carpathians are recorded the Anarti, Teurisci and Costoboci. The Anarti (or Anartes) and the Teurisci were originally probably Celtic peoples or mixed Dacian-Celtic. The Anarti, together with the Celtic Cotini, are described by Tacitus as vassals of the powerful Quadi Germanic people. The Teurisci were probably a group of Celtic Taurisci from the eastern Alps. However, archaeology has revealed that the Celtic tribes had originally spread from west to east as far as Transylvania, before being absorbed by the Dacians in the 1st century BC.

====Costoboci====

The main view is that the &quot;Costoboci&quot; were ethnically Dacian. Others considered them a Slavic or Sarmatian tribe. There was also a Celtic influence, so that some consider them a mixed Celtic and Thracian group that appear, after Trajan&#x27;s conquest, as a Dacian group within the Celtic superstratum. The Costoboci inhabited the southern slopes of the Carpathians. Ptolemy named the Coestoboci (Costoboci in Roman sources) twice, showing them divided by the Dniester and the Peucinian (Carpathian) Mountains. This suggests that they lived on both sides of the Carpathians, but it is also possible that two accounts about the same people were combined. There was also a group, the Transmontani, that some modern scholars identify as Dacian Transmontani Costoboci of the extreme north. The name Transmontani was from the Dacians&#x27; Latin, literally &quot;people over the mountains&quot;. Mullenhoff identified these with the Transiugitani, another Dacian tribe north of the Carpathian mountains.

Based on the account of Dio Cassius, Heather (2010) considers that Hasding Vandals, around 171 AD, attempted to take control of lands which previously belonged to the free Dacian group called the Costoboci. Hrushevskyi (1997) mentions that the earlier widespread view that these Carpathian tribes were Slavic has no basis. This would be contradicted by the Coestobocan names themselves that are known from the inscriptions, written by a Coestobocan and therefore presumably accurately. These names sound quite unlike anything Slavic. Scholars such as Tomaschek (1883), Schütte (1917) and Russu (1969) consider these Costobocian names to be Thraco-Dacian. This inscription also indicates the Dacian background of the wife of the Costobocian king &quot;Ziais Tiati filia Daca&quot;. This indication of the socio-familial line of descent seen also in other inscriptions (i.e. Diurpaneus qui Euprepes Sterissae f(ilius) Dacus) is a custom attested since the historical period (beginning in the 5th century BC) when Thracians were under Greek influence. It may not have originated with the Thracians, as it could be just a fashion borrowed from Greeks for specifying ancestry and for distinguishing homonymous individuals within the tribe. Schütte (1917), Parvan, and Florescu (1982) pointed also to the Dacian characteristic place names ending in &#x27;–dava&#x27; given by Ptolemy in the Costoboci&#x27;s country.

====Carpi====

The Carpi were a sizeable group of tribes, who lived beyond the north-eastern boundary of Roman Dacia. The majority view among modern scholars is that the Carpi were a North Thracian tribe and a subgroup of the Dacians. However, some historians classify them as Slavs.
According to Heather (2010), the Carpi were Dacians from the eastern foothills of the Carpathian range – modern Moldavia and Wallachia – who had not been brought under direct Roman rule at the time of Trajan&#x27;s conquest of Transylvania Dacia. After they generated a new degree of political unity among themselves in the course of the third century, these Dacian groups came to be known collectively as the Carpi.
The ancient sources about the Carpi, before 104 AD, located them on a territory situated between the western side of Eastern European Galicia and the mouth of the Danube. The name of the tribe is homonymous with the Carpathian mountains. Carpi and Carpathian are Dacian words derived from the root &quot;(s)ker&quot;- &quot;cut&quot; cf. Albanian &quot;karp&quot; &quot;stone&quot; and Sanskrit &quot;kar&quot;- &quot;cut&quot;.
A quote from the 6th-century Byzantine chronicler Zosimus referring to the Carpo-Dacians (Greek: Καρποδάκαι, Latin: &quot;Carpo-Dacae&quot;), who attacked the Romans in the late 4th century, is seen as evidence of their Dacian ethnicity. In fact, Carpi/Carpodaces is the term used for Dacians outside of Dacia proper.
However, that the Carpi were Dacians is shown not so much by the form Καρποδάκαι in Zosimus as by their characteristic place-names in –&quot;dava&quot;, given by Ptolemy in their country. The origin and ethnic affiliations of the Carpi have been debated over the years; in modern times they are closely associated with the Carpathian Mountains, and a good case has been made for attributing to the Carpi a distinct material culture, &quot;a developed form of the Geto-Dacian La Tene culture&quot;, often known as the Poienesti culture, which is characteristic of this area.

===Physical characteristics===

Dacians are represented in the statues surmounting the Arch of Constantine and on Trajan&#x27;s Column. The artist of the Column took some care to depict, in his opinion, a variety of Dacian people—from high-ranking men, women, and children to the near-savage. Although the artist looked to models in Hellenistic art for some body types and compositions, he does not represent the Dacians as generic barbarians.

Classical authors applied a generalized stereotype when describing the &quot;barbarians&quot;Celts, Scythians, Thraciansinhabiting the regions to the north of the Greek world. In accordance with this stereotype, all these peoples are described, in sharp contrast to the &quot;civilized&quot; Greeks, as being much taller, their skin lighter and with straight light-coloured hair and blue eyes. For instance, Aristotle wrote that &quot;the Scythians on the Black Sea and the Thracians are straight-haired, for both they themselves and the environing air are moist&quot;; according to Clement of Alexandria, Xenophanes described the Thracians as &quot;ruddy and tawny&quot;. On Trajan&#x27;s column, Dacian soldiers&#x27; hair is depicted longer than the hair of Roman soldiers and they had trimmed beards.

Body-painting was customary among the Dacians. It is probable that the tattooing originally had a religious significance. They practiced symbolic-ritual tattooing or body painting for both men and women, with hereditary symbols transmitted up to the fourth generation.

==History==
===Early history===
In the absence of historical records written by the Dacians (and Thracians) themselves, analysis of their origins depends largely on the remains of material culture. On the whole, the Bronze Age witnessed the evolution of the ethnic groups which emerged during the Eneolithic period, and eventually the syncretism of both autochthonous and Indo-European elements from the steppes and the Pontic regions. Various groups of Thracians had not separated out by 1200 BC, but there are strong similarities between the ceramic types found at Troy and the ceramic types from the Carpathian area. About the year 1000 BC, the Carpatho-Danubian countries were inhabited by a northern branch of the Thracians. At the time of the arrival of the Scythians (c. 700 BC), the Carpatho-Danubian Thracians were developing rapidly towards the Iron Age civilization of the West. Moreover, the whole of the fourth period of the Carpathian Bronze Age had already been profoundly influenced by the first Iron Age as it developed in Italy and the Alpine lands. The Scythians, arriving with their own type of Iron Age civilization, put a stop to these relations with the West. From roughly 500 BC (the second Iron Age), the Dacians developed a distinct civilization, which was capable of supporting large centralised kingdoms by the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD.

Since the very first detailed account by Herodotus, Getae are acknowledged as belonging to the Thracians. Still, they are distinguished from the other Thracians by particularities of religion and custom. The first written mention of the name &quot;Dacians&quot; is in Roman sources, but classical authors are unanimous in considering them a branch of the Getae, a Thracian people known from Greek writings. Strabo specified that the Daci are the Getae who lived in the area towards the Pannonian plain (Transylvania), while the Getae proper gravitated towards the Black Sea coast (Scythia Minor).

===Relations with Thracians===
Since the writings of Herodotus in the 5th century BC, Getae/Dacians are acknowledged as belonging to the Thracian sphere of influence. Despite this, they are distinguished from other Thracians by particularities of religion and custom. Geto-Dacians and Thracians were kin people but they were not the same. The differences from the southern Thracians or from the neighbouring Scythians were probably faint, as several ancient authors make confusions of identification with both groups. Linguist Vladimir Georgiev says that based on the absence of toponyms ending in &quot;dava&quot; in Southern Bulgaria, the Moesians and Dacians (or as he calls them Daco-Mysians) couldn&#x27;t be related to the Thracians.

In the 19th century, Tomaschek considered a close affinity between the Besso-Thracians and Getae-Dacians, an original kinship of both people with Iranian peoples. They are Aryan tribes, several centuries before Scolotes of the Pont and Sauromatae left the Aryan homeland and settled in the Carpathian chain, in the Haemus (Balkan) and Rhodope mountains. The Besso-Thracians and Getae-Dacians separated very early from Aryans, since their language still maintains roots that are missing from Iranian and it shows non-Iranian phonetic characteristics (i.e. replacing the Iranian &quot;l&quot; with &quot;r&quot;).

===Relations with Celts===

Geto-Dacians inhabited both sides of the Tisa River before the rise of the Celtic Boii, and again after the latter were defeated by the Dacians under king Burebista. During the second half of the 4th century BC, Celtic cultural influence appears in the archaeological records of the middle Danube, Alpine region, and north-western Balkans, where it was part of the Middle La Tène material culture. This material appears in north-western and central Dacia, and is reflected especially in burials. The Dacians absorbed the Celtic influence from the northwest in the early third century BC. Archaeological investigation of this period has highlighted several Celtic warrior graves with military equipment. It suggests the forceful penetration of a military Celtic elite within the region of Dacia, now known as Transylvania, that is bounded on the east by the Carpathian range. The archaeological sites of the third and second centuries BC in Transylvania revealed a pattern of co-existence and fusion between the bearers of La Tène culture and indigenous Dacians. These were domestic dwellings with a mixture of Celtic and Dacian pottery, and several graves in the Celtic style containing vessels of Dacian type. There are some seventy Celtic sites in Transylvania, mostly cemeteries, but most if not all of them indicate that the native population imitated Celtic art forms that took their fancy, but remained obstinately and fundamentally Dacian in their culture.

The Celtic Helmet from Ciumeşti, Satu Mare, Romania (northern Dacia), an Iron Age raven totem helmet, dated around the 4th century BC. A similar helmet is depicted on the Thraco-Celtic Gundestrup cauldron, being worn by one of the mounted warriors (detail tagged here). See also an illustration of Brennos wearing a similar helmet.
Around 150 BC, La Tène material disappears from the area. This coincides with the ancient writings which mention the rise of Dacian authority. It ended the Celtic domination, and it is possible that Celts were driven out of Dacia. Alternatively, some scholars have proposed that the Transylvanian Celts remained, but merged into the local culture and thus ceased to be distinctive.

Archaeological discoveries in the settlements and fortifications of the Dacians in the period of their kingdoms (1st century BC and 1st century AD) included imported Celtic vessels and others made by Dacian potters imitating Celtic prototypes, showing that relations between the Dacians and the Celts from the regions north and west of Dacia continued. In present-day Slovakia, archaeology has revealed evidence for mixed Celtic-Dacian populations in the Nitra and Hron river basins.

After the Dacians subdued the Celtic tribes, the remaining Cotini stayed in the mountains of Central Slovakia, where they took up mining and metalworking. Together with the original domestic population, they created the Puchov culture that spread into central and northern Slovakia, including Spis, and penetrated northeastern Moravia and southern Poland. Along the Bodrog River in Zemplin they created Celtic-Dacian settlements which were known for the production of painted ceramics.

===Relations with Persians===

Herodotus says: &quot;before Darius reached the Danube, the first people he subdued were the Getae, who believed that they never die&quot;. A persian clay tablet found at Gherla mentions Darius and although the Persian army probably did not reach the modern findspot of the tablet, the object is probably evidence of the Persian campaign to Dacia.

It is possible that the Persian expedition and the subsequent occupation may have altered the way in which the Getae expressed the immortality belief. The influence of thirty years of Achaemenid presence may be detected in the emergence of an explicit iconography of the &quot;Royal Hunt&quot; that influenced Dacian and Thracian metalworkers, and of the practice of hawking by their upper class.

===Relations with Greeks===

Greek and Roman chroniclers record the defeat and capture of the Macedonian general Lysimachus in the 3rd century BC by the Getae (Dacians) ruled by Dromihete, their military strategy, and the release of Lysimachus following a debate in the assembly of the Getae.

===Relations with Scythians===
====Agathyrsi Transylvania====
The Scythians&#x27; arrival in the Carpathian mountains is dated to 700 BC. The Agathyrsi of Transylvania had been mentioned by Herodotus (fifth century BC), who regarded them as not a Scythian people, but closely related to them. In other respects, their customs were close to those of the Thracians. The Agathyrsi were completely denationalized at the time of Herodotus and absorbed by the native Thracians.

The opinion that the Agathyrsi were almost certainly Thracians results also from the writings preserved by Stephen of Byzantium, who explains that the Greeks called the Trausi the Agathyrsi, and we know that the Trausi lived in the Rhodope Mountains. Certain details from their way of life, such as tattooing, also suggest that the Agathyrsi were Thracians. Their place was later taken by the Dacians. That the Dacians were of Thracian stock is not in doubt, and it is safe to assume that this new name also encompassed the Agathyrsi, and perhaps other neighbouring Thracian people as well, as a result of some political upheaval.

===Relations with Germanic tribes===


The Goths, a confederation of east German peoples, arrived in southern Ukraine no later than 230. During the next decade, a large section of them moved down the Black Sea coast and occupied much of the territory north of the lower Danube. The Goths&#x27; advance towards the area north of the Black Sea involved competing with the indigenous population of Dacian-speaking Carpi, as well as indigenous Iranian-speaking Sarmatians and Roman garrison forces. The Carpi, often called &quot;Free Dacians&quot;, continued to dominate the anti-Roman coalition made up of themselves, Taifali, Astringi, Vandals, Peucini, and Goths until 248, when the Goths assumed the hegemony of the loose coalition. The first lands taken over by the Thervingi Goths were in Moldavia, and only during the fourth century did they move in strength down into the Danubian plain. The Carpi found themselves squeezed between the advancing Goths and the Roman province of Dacia. In 275 AD, Aurelian surrendered the Dacian territory to the Carpi and the Goths. Over time, Gothic power in the region grew, at the Carpi&#x27;s expense. The Germanic-speaking Goths replaced native Dacian-speakers as the dominant force around the Carpathian mountains. Large numbers of Carpi, but not all of them, were admitted into the Roman empire in the twenty-five years or so after 290 AD. Despite this evacuation of the Carpi around 300 AD, considerable groups of the natives (non-Romanized Dacians, Sarmatians and others) remained in place under Gothic domination.

In 330 AD, the Gothic Thervingi contemplated moving to the Middle Danube region, and from 370 relocated with their fellow Gothic Greuthungi to new homes in the Roman Empire. The Ostrogoths were still more isolated, but even the Visigoths preferred to live among their own kind. As a result, the Goths settled in pockets. Finally, although Roman towns continued on a reduced level, there is no question as to their survival.

In 336 AD, Constantine took the title &quot;Dacicus Maximus&quot; &#x27;great victor in Dacia&#x27;, implying at least partial reconquest of Trajan Dacia. In an inscription of 337, Constantine was commemorated officially as Germanicus Maximus, Sarmaticus, Gothicus Maximus, and Dacicus Maximus, meaning he had defeated the Germans, Sarmatians, Goths, and Dacians.

===Dacian kingdoms===


Dacian polities arose as confederacies that included the Getae, the Daci, the Buri, and the Carpi (cf. Bichir 1976, Shchukin 1989), united only periodically by the leadership of Dacian kings such as Burebista and Decebal. This union was both military-political and ideological-religious on ethnic basis. The following are some of the attested Dacian kingdoms:

The kingdom of Cothelas, one of the Getae, covered an area near the Black Sea, between northern Thrace and the Danube, today Bulgaria, in the 4th century BC. The kingdom of Rubobostes controlled a region in Transylvania in the 2nd century BC. Gaius Scribonius Curio (proconsul 75–73 BC) campaigned successfully against the Dardani and the Moesi, becoming the first Roman general to reach the river Danube with his army. His successor, Marcus Licinius Lucullus, brother of the famous Lucius Lucullus, campaigned against the Thracian Bessi tribe and the Moesi, ravaging the whole of Moesia, the region between the Haemus (Balkan) mountain range and the Danube. In 72 BC, his troops occupied the Greek coastal cities of Scythia Minor (the modern Dobrogea region in Romania and Bulgaria), which had sided with Rome&#x27;s Hellenistic arch-enemy, king Mithridates VI of Pontus, in the Third Mithridatic War. Greek geographer Strabo claimed that the Dacians and Getae had been able to muster a combined army of 200,000 men during Strabo&#x27;s era, the time of Roman emperor Augustus.

====The kingdom of Burebista====
The Dacian kingdom reached its maximum extent under king Burebista (ruled 82 – 44 BC). The capital of the kingdom was possibly the city of Argedava, also called Sargedava in some historical writings, situated close to the river Danube. The kingdom of Burebista extended south of the Danube, in what is today Bulgaria, and the Greeks believed their king was the greatest of all Thracians. During his reign, Burebista transferred the Geto-Dacians&#x27; capital from Argedava to Sarmizegetusa. For at least one and a half centuries, Sarmizegethusa was the Dacian capital, reaching its peak under king Decebalus. Burebista annexed the Greek cities on the Pontus.(55–48 BC). Augustus wanted to avenge the defeat of Gaius Antonius Hybrida at Histria (Sinoe) 32 years before, and to recover the lost standards. These were held in a powerful fortress called Genucla (Isaccea, near modern Tulcea, in the Danube delta region of Romania), controlled by Zyraxes, the local Getan petty king. The man selected for the task was Marcus Licinius Crassus, grandson of Crassus the triumvir, and an experienced general at 33 years of age, who was appointed proconsul of Macedonia in 29 BC.
====The kingdom of Decebalus 87 – 106====
By the year AD 100, more than 400,000 square kilometres were dominated by the Dacians, who numbered two million. Decebalus was the last king of the Dacians, and despite his fierce resistance against the Romans was defeated, and committed suicide rather than being marched through Rome in a triumph as a captured enemy leader.

===Conflict with Rome===
Burebista&#x27;s Dacian state was powerful enough to threaten Rome, and Caesar contemplated campaigning against the Dacians. Despite this, the formidable Dacian power under Burebista lasted only until his death in 44 BC. The subsequent division of Dacia continued for about a century until the reign of Scorilo. This was a period of only occasional attacks on the Roman Empire&#x27;s border, with some local significance.

The unifying actions of the last Dacian king Decebalus (ruled 87–106 AD) were seen as dangerous by Rome. Despite the fact that the Dacian army could now gather only some 40,000 soldiers, Decebalus&#x27; raids south of the Danube proved unstoppable and costly. In the Romans&#x27; eyes, the situation at the border with Dacia was out of control, and Emperor Domitian (ruled 81 to 96 AD) tried desperately to deal with the danger through military action. But the outcome of Rome&#x27;s disastrous campaigns into Dacia in AD 86 and AD 88 pushed Domitian to settle the situation through diplomacy.

Emperor Trajan (ruled 98–117 AD) opted for a different approach and decided to conquer the Dacian kingdom, partly in order to seize its vast gold mines wealth. The effort required two major wars (the Dacian Wars), one in 101–102 AD and the other in 105–106 AD. Only fragmentary details survive of the Dacian war: a single sentence of Trajan&#x27;s own Dacica; little more of the Getica written by his doctor, T. Statilius Crito; nothing whatsoever of the poem proposed by Caninius Rufus (if it was ever written), Dio Chrysostom&#x27;s Getica or Appian&#x27;s Dacica. Nonetheless, a reasonable account can be pieced together.

In the first war, Trajan invaded Dacia by crossing the river Danube with a boat-bridge and inflicted a crushing defeat on the Dacians at the Second Battle of Tapae in 101 AD. The Dacian king Decebalus was forced to sue for peace. Trajan and Decebalus then concluded a peace treaty which was highly favourable to the Romans. The peace agreement required the Dacians to cede some territory to the Romans and to demolish their fortifications. Decebalus&#x27; foreign policy was also restricted, as he was prohibited from entering into alliances with other tribes.

However, both Trajan and Decebalus considered this only a temporary truce and readied themselves for renewed war. Trajan had Greek engineer Apollodorus of Damascus construct a stone bridge over the Danube river, while Decebalus secretly plotted alliances against the Romans. In 105, Trajan crossed the Danube river and besieged Decebalus&#x27; capital, Sarmizegetusa, but the siege failed because of Decebalus&#x27; allied tribes. However, Trajan was an optimist. He returned with a newly constituted army and took Sarmizegetusa by treachery. Decebalus fled into the mountains, but was cornered by pursuing Roman cavalry. Decebalus committed suicide rather than being captured by the Romans and be paraded as a slave, then be killed. The Roman captain took his head and right hand to Trajan, who had them displayed in the Forums. Trajan&#x27;s Column in Rome was constructed to celebrate the conquest of Dacia.

The Roman people hailed Trajan&#x27;s triumph in Dacia with the longest and most expensive celebration in their history, financed by a part of the gold taken from the Dacians. For his triumph, Trajan gave a 123-day festival (ludi) of celebration, in which approximately 11,000 animals were slaughtered and 11,000 gladiators fought in combats. This surpassed Emperor Titus&#x27;s celebration in AD 70, when a 100-day festival included 3,000 gladiators and 5,000 to 9,000 wild animals.

===Roman rule===
Only about half part of Dacia then became a Roman province, with a newly built capital at Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa, 40 km away from the site of Old Sarmisegetuza Regia, which was razed to the ground. The name of the Dacians&#x27; homeland, Dacia, became the name of a Roman province, and the name Dacians was used to designate the people in the region. &quot;Roman Dacia&quot;, also &quot;Dacia Traiana&quot; or &quot;Dacia Felix&quot;, was a province of the Roman Empire from 106 to 271 or 275 AD. Its territory consisted of eastern and southeastern Transylvania, and the regions of Banat and Oltenia (located in modern Romania). Dacia was organised from the beginning as an imperial province, and remained so throughout the Roman occupation. It was one of the empire&#x27;s Latin provinces; official epigraphs attest that the language of administration was Latin. Historian estimates of the population of Roman Dacia range from 650,000 to 1,200,000.

Dacians that remained outside the Roman Empire after the Dacian wars of AD 101–106 had been named Dakoi prosoroi (Latin &quot;Daci limitanei&quot;), &quot;neighbouring Dacians&quot;. Modern historians use the generic name &quot;Free Dacians&quot; or &quot;Independent Dacians&quot;. The tribes Daci Magni (Great Dacians), Costoboci (generally considered a Dacian subtribe), and Carpi remained outside the Roman empire, in what the Romans called &quot;Dacia Libera&quot; (Free Dacia). By the early third century the &quot;Free Dacians&quot; were a significantly troublesome group, by now identified as the Carpi. Bichir argues that the Carpi were the most powerful of the Dacian tribes who had become the principal enemy of the Romans in the region. In 214 AD, Caracalla campaigned against the Free Dacians. There were also campaigns against the Dacians recorded in 236 AD.

Roman Dacia was evacuated by the Romans under emperor Aurelian (ruled 271–5 AD). Aurelian made this decision on account of counter-pressures on the Empire there caused by the Carpi, Visigoths, Sarmatians, and Vandals; the lines of defence needed to be shortened, and Dacia was deemed not defensible given the demands on available resources. Roman power in Thracia rested mainly with the legions stationed in Moesia. The rural nature of Thracia&#x27;s populations, and the distance from Roman authority, encouraged the presence of local troops to support Moesia&#x27;s legions. Over the next few centuries, the province was periodically and increasingly attacked by migrating Germanic tribes. The reign of Justinian saw the construction of over 100 legionary fortresses to supplement the defence. Thracians in Moesia and Dacia were Romanized, while those within the Byzantine empire were their Hellenized descendants that had mingled with the Greeks.

===After the Aurelian Retreat===
Roman Dacia was never a uniformly or fully Romanized area. Post-Aurelianic Dacia fell into three divisions: the area along the river, usually under some type of Roman administration even if in a highly localized form; the zone beyond this area, from which Roman military personnel had withdrawn, leaving a sizable population behind that was generally Romanized; and finally what is now the northern parts of Moldavia, Crisana, and Maramures, which were never occupied by the Romans. These last areas were always peripheral to the Roman province, not militarily occupied but nonetheless influenced by Rome as part of the Roman economic sphere. Here lived the free, unoccupied Carpi, often called &quot;Free Dacians&quot;.

The Aurelian retreat was a purely military decision to withdraw the Roman troops to defend the Danube. The inhabitants of the old province of Dacia displayed no awareness of impending dissolution. There were no sudden flights or dismantling of property. It is not possible to discern how many civilians followed the army out of Dacia; it is clear that there was no mass emigration, since there is evidence of continuity of settlement in Dacian villages and farms; the evacuation may not at first have been intended to be a permanent measure. The Romans left the province, but they didn&#x27;t consider that they lost it. Dobrogea was not abandoned at all, but continued as part of the Roman Empire for over 350 years. As late as AD 300, the tetrarchic emperors had resettled tens of thousands of Dacian Carpi inside the empire, dispersing them in communities the length of the Danube, from Austria to the Black Sea.

==Society==
Dacians were divided into two classes: the aristocracy (&quot;tarabostes&quot;) and the common people (&quot;comati&quot;). Only the aristocracy had the right to cover their heads, and wore a felt hat. The common people, who comprised the rank and file of the army, the peasants and artisans, might have been called &quot;capillati&quot; in Latin. Their appearance and clothing can be seen on Trajan&#x27;s Column.

===Occupations===

The chief occupations of the Dacians were agriculture, apiculture, viticulture, livestock, ceramics and metalworking. They also worked the gold and silver mines of Transylvania. At Pecica, Arad, a Dacian workshop was discovered, along with equipment for minting coins and evidence of bronze, silver, and iron-working that suggests a broad spectrum of smithing. Evidence for the mass production of iron is found on many Dacian sites, indicating guild-like specialization. Dacian ceramic manufacturing traditions continue from the pre-Roman to the Roman period, both in provincial and unoccupied Dacia, and well into the fourth and even early fifth centuries. They engaged in considerable external trade, as is shown by the number of foreign coins found in the country (see also Decebalus Treasure). On the northernmost frontier of &quot;free Dacia&quot;, coin circulation steadily grew in the first and second centuries, with a decline in the third and a rise again in the fourth century; the same pattern as observed for the Banat region to the southwest. What is remarkable is the extent and increase in coin circulation after Roman withdrawal from Dacia, and as far north as Transcarpathia.

===Currency===

The first coins produced by the Geto-Dacians were imitations of silver coins of the Macedonian kings Philip II and Alexander the Great. Early in the 1st century BC, the Dacians replaced these with silver denarii of the Roman Republic, both official coins of Rome exported to Dacia, as well as locally made imitations of them. The Roman province Dacia is represented on the Roman sestertius coin as a woman seated on a rock, holding an aquila, a small child on her knee. The aquila holds ears of grain, and another small child is seated before her holding grapes.

===Construction===

Dacians had developed the murus dacicus (double-skinned ashlar-masonry with rubble fill and tie beams) characteristic to their complexes of fortified cities, like their capital Sarmizegetusa Regia in what is today Hunedoara County, Romania. This type of wall has been discovered not only in the Dacian citadel of the Orastie mountains, but also in those at Covasna, Breaza near Făgăraș, Tilișca near Sibiu, Căpâlna in the Sebeș valley, Bănița not far from Petroșani, and Piatra Craivii to the north of Alba Iulia. The degree of their urban development was displayed on Trajan&#x27;s Column and in the account of how Sarmizegetusa Regia was defeated by the Romans. The Romans were given by treachery the locations of aqueducts and pipelines of the Dacian capital, only after destroying the water supply being able to end the long siege of Sarmisegetuza.

==Material culture==
According to Romanian nationalist archaeology, the cradle of the Dacian culture is considered to be north of the Danube towards the Carpathian mountains, in the historical Romanian province of Muntenia. It is identified as an evolution of the Iron Age Basarabi culture. Such narrative believe that the earlier Iron Age Basarabi evidence in the northern lower Danube area connects to the iron-using Ferigile-Birsesti group. This is an archaeological manifestation of the historical Getae who, along with the Agathyrsae, are one of a number of tribal formations recorded by Herodotus. In archaeology, &quot;free Dacians&quot; are attested by the Puchov culture (in which there are Celtic elements) and Lipiţa culture to the east of the Carpathians. The Lipiţa culture has a Dacian/North Thracian origin. This North Thracian population was dominated by strong Celtic influences, or had simply absorbed Celtic ethnic components. Lipiţa culture has been linked to the Dacian tribe of Costoboci.
These standpoints are highly problematic, as there is no linear continuity between aforementioned cultures. in reality, the creation of the Dacian ethnos was foreshadowed by migratory movements from the lower Danube region following the collapse of the Celtic cultural circle c. 300 BC (The grave with a helmet from Ciumeşti – 50 years from its discovery. Comments on the greaves. 2. The Padea-Panagjurski kolonii group in Transylvania. Old and new discoveries)

Specific Dacian material culture includes: wheel-turned pottery that is generally plain but with distinctive elite wares, massive silver dress fibulae, precious metal plate, ashlar masonry, fortifications, upland sanctuaries with horseshoe-shaped precincts, and decorated clay heart altars at settlement sites. Among many discovered artifacts, the Dacian bracelets stand out, depicting their cultural and aesthetic sense. There are difficulties correlating funerary monuments chronologically with Dacian settlements; a small number of burials are known, along with cremation pits, and isolated rich burials as at Cugir. Dacian burial ritual continued under Roman occupation and into the post-Roman period.

===Language===
The Dacians are generally considered to have been Thracian speakers, representing a cultural continuity from earlier Iron Age communities. Some historians and linguists consider Dacian language to be a dialect of or the same language as Thracian. The vocalism and consonantism differentiate the Dacian and Thracian languages. Others consider that Dacian and Illyrian form regional varieties (dialects) of a common language. (Thracians inhabited modern southern Bulgaria and northern Greece. Illyrians lived in modern Albania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.)

The ancient languages of these people became extinct, and their cultural influence highly reduced, after the repeated invasions of the Balkans by Celts, Huns, Goths, and Sarmatians, accompanied by persistent hellenization, romanisation and later slavicisation. Therefore, in the study of the toponomy of Dacia, one must take account of the fact that some place-names were taken by the Slavs from as yet unromanised Dacians. A number of Dacian words are preserved in ancient sources, amounting to about 1150 anthroponyms and 900 toponyms, and in Discorides some of the rich plant lore of the Dacians is preserved along with the names of 42 medicinal plants.

===Symbols===
The Dacians knew about writing. Permanent contacts with the Graeco-Roman world had brought the use of the Greek and later the Latin alphabet. It is also certainly not the case that writing with Greek and Latin letters and knowledge of Greek and Latin were known in all the settlements scattered throughout Dacia, but there is no doubt about the existence of such knowledge in some circles of Dacian society. However, the most revealing discoveries concerning the use of the writing by the Dacians occurred in the citadels on the Sebes mountains. Some groups of letters from stone blocks at Sarmisegetuza might express personal names; these cannot now be read because the wall is ruined, and because it is impossible to restore the original order of the blocks in the wall.

===Religion===

Dacian religion was considered by the classic sources as a key source of authority, suggesting to some that Dacia was a predominantly theocratic state led by priest-kings. However, the layout of the Dacian capital Sarmizegethusa indicates the possibility of co-rulership, with a separate high king and high priest. Ancient sources recorded the names of several Dacian high priests (Deceneus, Comosicus and Vezina) and various orders of priests: &quot;god-worshipers&quot;, &quot;smoke-walkers&quot; and &quot;founders&quot;. Both Hellenistic and Oriental influences are discernible in the religious background, alongside chthonic and solar motifs.

According to Herodotus&#x27; account of the story of Zalmoxis or Zamolxis, the Getae (speaking the same language as the Dacians and the Thracians, according to Strabo) believed in the immortality of the soul, and regarded death as merely a change of country. Their chief priest held a prominent position as the representative of the supreme deity, Zalmoxis, who is called also Gebeleizis by some among them. Strabo wrote about the high priest of King Burebista Deceneus: &quot;a man who not only had wandered through Egypt, but also had thoroughly learned certain prognostics through which he would pretend to tell the divine will; and within a short time he was set up as god (as I said when relating the story of Zamolxis).&quot;

The Goth Jordanes in his &quot;Getica&quot; (&quot;The origin and deeds of the Goths&quot;), also gives an account of Deceneus the highest priest, and considered Dacians a nation related to the Goths. Besides Zalmoxis, the Dacians believed in other deities, such as Gebeleizis, the god of storm and lightning, possibly related to the Thracian god Zibelthiurdos. He was represented as a handsome man, sometimes with a beard. Later Gebeleizis was equated with Zalmoxis as the same god. According to Herodotus, Gebeleizis (*Zebeleizis/Gebeleizis who is only mentioned by Herodotus) is just another name of Zalmoxis.

Another important deity was Bendis, goddess of the moon and the hunt.
By a decree of the oracle of Dodona, which required the Athenians to grant land for a shrine or temple, her cult was introduced into Attica by immigrant Thracian residents, and, though Thracian and Athenian processions remained separate, both cult and festival became so popular that in Plato&#x27;s time (c. 429–13 BC) its festivities were naturalised as an official ceremony of the Athenian city-state, called the Bendideia.

Known Dacian theonyms include &quot;Zalmoxis&quot;, &quot;Gebeleïzis&quot; and &quot;Darzalas&quot;. Gebeleizis is probably cognate to the Thracian god Zibelthiurdos (also &quot;Zbelsurdos&quot;, &quot;Zibelthurdos&quot;), wielder of lightning and thunderbolts. Derzelas (also &quot;Darzalas&quot;) was a chthonic god of health and human vitality. The pagan religion survived longer in Dacia than in other parts of the empire; Christianity made little headway until the fifth century.

===Pottery===
Fragments of pottery with different &quot;inscriptions&quot; with Latin and Greek letters incised before and after firing have been discovered in the settlement at Ocnita – Valcea. An inscription carries the word Basileus (Βασιλεύς in Greek, meaning &quot;king&quot;) and seems to have been written before the vessel was hardened by fire. Other inscriptions contain the name of the king, believed to be Thiemarcus, and Latin groups of letters (BVR, REB). BVR indicates the name of the tribe or union of tribes, the Buridavensi Dacians who lived at Buridava and who were mentioned by Ptolemy in the second century AD under the name of Buridavensioi.

===Clothing and science===
The typical dress of Dacians, both men and women, can be seen on Trajan&#x27;s column.

Dio Chrysostom described the Dacians as natural philosophers.
==Warfare==

The history of Dacian warfare spans from c. 10th century BC up to the 2nd century AD in the region typically referred to by Ancient Greek and Latin historians as Dacia. It concerns the armed conflicts of the Dacian tribes and their kingdoms in the Balkans. Apart from conflicts between Dacians and neighboring nations and tribes, numerous wars were recorded among Dacian tribes as well.

===Weapons===

The weapon most associated with the Dacian forces that fought against Trajan&#x27;s army during his invasions of Dacia was the falx, a single-edged scythe-like weapon. The falx was able to inflict horrible wounds on opponents, easily disabling or killing the heavily armored Roman legionaries that they faced. This weapon, more so than any other single factor, forced the Roman army to adopt previously unused or modified equipment to suit the conditions on the Dacian battlefield.

==Notable individuals==

This is a list of several important Dacian individuals or those of partly Dacian origin.
* Zalmoxis, a semi-legendary social and religious reformer, eventually deified by the Getae and Dacians and regarded as the only true god.
* Zoltes
* Burebista was a king of Dacia, 70–44 BC, who united under his rule Thracians in a large territory, from today&#x27;s Moravia in the West, to the Southern Bug river (Ukraine) in the East, and from the Northern Carpathian Mountains to Southern Dionysopolis. The Greeks considered him the first and greatest king of Thrace.
* Decebalus, a king of Dacia who was ultimately defeated by the forces of Trajan.
* Diegis was a Dacian chief, general and brother of Decebalus, and his representative at the peace negotiations held with Domitian (89 CE)

==Romanian cultural affects==
Study of the Dacians, their culture, society and religion is not purely a subject of ancient history, but has present day implications in the context of Romanian nationalism. Positions taken on the vexed question of the origin of the Romanians and to what degree are present-day Romanians descended from the Dacians might have contemporary political implications. For example, the government of Nicolae Ceaușescu claimed an uninterrupted continuity of a Dacian-Romanian state, from King Burebista to Ceaușescu himself. The Ceaușescu government conspicuously commemorated the supposed 2,050th anniversary of the founding of the &quot;unified and centralized&quot; country that was to become Romania, on which occasion the historical film &quot;Burebista&quot; was produced.

&quot;The ducks come from the trucks.&quot; – A Romanian language pun about a mistranslation (duck and truck sound like dac and trac, the ethnonyms for Dacian and Thracian).

<text>The Mahavidya (, , lit. &quot;Great Wisdoms&quot;) are a group of ten Hindu Tantric goddesses. The ten Mahavidyas are usually named in the following sequence: Kali, Tara, Tripura Sundari, Bhuvaneshvari, Bhairavi, Chhinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bagalamukhi, Matangi and Kamalatmika. Nevertheless, the formation of this group encompass divergent and varied religious traditions that include &quot;yogini&quot; worship, Saivism, Vaishnavism, and Vajrayana Buddhism.

The development of the Mahavidyas represents an important turning point in the history of Shaktism as it marks the rise of the Bhakti aspect in Shaktism, which reached its zenith in 1700 CE. First sprung forth in the post-Puranic age, around 6th century CE, it was a new theistic movement in which the supreme being was envisioned as female. A fact epitomized by texts like &quot;Devi-Bhagavata Purana&quot;, especially its last nine chapters (31–40) of the seventh &quot;skandha&quot;, which are known as the &quot;Devi Gita&quot;, and soon became central texts of Shaktism.

==Names==
Shaktas believe, &quot;the one Truth is sensed in ten different facets; the Divine Mother is adored and approached as ten cosmic personalities,&quot; the Dasa-Mahavidya (&quot;ten-Mahavidyas&quot;). As per another school of thought in Shaktism Mahavidyas are considered to be form of Mahakali. The Mahavidyas are considered Tantric in nature, and are usually identified as:
#&quot;Kali&quot; The goddess who is the ultimate form of Brahman, and the devourer of time (Supreme Deity of &quot;Kalikula&quot; systems). Mahakali is of a pitch black complexion, darker than the dark of the dead of the night. She has three eyes, representing the past, present and future. She has shining white, fang-like teeth, a gaping mouth, and her red, bloody tongue hanging from there. She has unbound, disheveled hairs. She wears tiger skins as her garments, a garland of skulls and a garland of rosy red flowers around her neck, and on her belt, she was adorned with skeletal bones, skeletal hands as well as severed arms and hands as her ornamentation. She has four hands, two of them had the Kharga (a Sickle or Scythe) and the sword and two others carried a demon head and a bowl collecting the blood dripping from a demon head.
#&quot;Tara&quot; The goddess who acts as a guide and a protector, and she who offers the ultimate knowledge that grants salvation. She is the goddess of all sources of energy. The energy of the sun is believed to originate from her. She manifested as the mother of Shiva after the incident of Samudra Manthana to heal him as her child. Tara is of a light blue complexion. She has disheveled hair, wearing a crown decorated with the digit of the half-moon. She has three eyes, a snake coiled comfortably around her throat, wearing the skins of tigers, and a garland of skulls. She is also seen wearing a belt supporting her skirt made of tiger-skin. Her four hands carry a lotus, scimitar, demon head and scissors. Her left foot rests on the laying down Shiva.
#&quot;Tripura Sundari&quot; (&quot;Shodashi&quot;, &quot;Lalita&quot;) The goddess who is &quot;beauty of the three worlds&quot; (Supreme Deity of &quot;Srikula&quot; systems); the &quot;Tantric Parvati&quot; or the &quot;Moksha Mukta&quot;. She is the ruler of Manidvipa, the eternal supreme abode of the goddess. Shodashi is seen with a molten gold complexion, three placid eyes, a calm mien, wearing red and pink vestments, adorned with ornaments on her divine limbs and four hands, each holding a goad, lotus, a bow, and arrow. She is seated on a throne.
#&quot;Bhuvaneshvari&quot; The goddess as the world mother, or whose body comprises all the fourteen lokas of the cosmos. Bhuvaneshvari is of a fair, golden complexion, with three content eyes as well as a calm mien. She wears red and yellow garments, decorated with ornaments on her limbs and has four hands. Two of her four hands hold a goad and noose while her other two hands are open. She is seated on a divine, celestial throne.
#&quot;Bhairavi&quot; The fierce goddess. The female version of Bhairava. Bhairavi is of a fiery, volcanic red complexion, with three furious eyes, and disheveled hair. Her hair is matted, tied up in a bun, decorated by a crescent moon as well as adorning two horns, one sticking out from each side. She has two protruding tusks from the ends of her bloody mouth. She wears red and blue garments and is adorned with a garland of skulls around her neck. She also wears a belt decorated with severed hands and bones attached to it. She is also decked with snakes and serpents too as her ornamentation – rarely is she seen wearing any jewelry on her limbs. Of her four hands, two are open and two hold a rosary and book.
#&quot;Chhinnamasta&quot; (&quot;She whose head is severed&quot;) – The self-decapitated goddess. She chopped her own head off in order to satisfy Jaya and Vijaya (metaphors of rajas and tamas - part of the &quot;trigunas&quot;). Chinnamasta has a red complexion, embodied with a frightful appearance. She has disheveled hair. She has four hands, two of which hold a sword and another hand holding her own severed head; three blazing eyes with a frightful mien, wearing a crown. Two of her other hands hold a lasso and drinking bowl. She is a partially clothed lady, adorned with ornaments on her limbs and wearing a garland of skulls on her body. She is mounted upon the back of a copulating couple.
#&quot;Dhumavati&quot; The widow goddess. Dhumavati is of a smoky dark brown complexion, her skin is wrinkled, her mouth is dry, some of her teeth have fallen out, her long disheveled hair is gray, her eyes are seen as bloodshot and she has a frightening mien, which is seen as a combined source of anger, misery, fear, exhaustion, restlessness, constant hunger and thirst. She wears white clothes, donned in the attire of a widow. She is sitting in a horseless chariot as her vehicle of transportation and on top of the chariot, there is an emblem of a crow as well as a banner. She has two trembling hands, her one hand bestows boons and/or knowledge and the other holds a winnowing basket.
#&quot;Bagalamukhi&quot; The goddess who paralyzes enemies. Bagalamukhi has a molten gold complexion with three bright eyes, lush black hair and a benign mien. She is seen wearing yellow garments and apparel. She is decked with yellow ornaments on her limbs. Her two hands hold a mace or club and holds demon Madanasura by the tongue to keep him at bay. She is shown seated on either a throne or on the back of a crane.
#&quot;Matangi&quot; – The Prime Minister of Lalita (in &quot;Srikula&quot; systems), sometimes called Śyāmala (&quot;dark in complexion&quot;, usually depicted as dark blue) and the &quot;Tantric Saraswati&quot;. Matangi is most often depicted as emerald green in complexion, with lush, disheveled black hair, three placid eyes and a calm look on her face. She is seen wearing red garments and apparel, bedecked with various ornaments all over her delicate limbs. She is seated on a royal throne and she has four hands, three of which hold a sword or scimitar, a skull and a veena (a musical instrument). Her one hand bestows boons to her devotees.
#&quot;Kamala&quot; (&quot;Kamalatmika&quot;) she who dwells in lotuses; sometimes called the &quot;Tantric Lakshmi&quot;. Kamala is of a molten gold complexion with lush black hair, three bright, placid eyes, and a benevolent expression. She is seen wearing red and pink garments and apparel and bedecked with various ornaments and lotuses all over her limbs. She is seated on a fully bloomed lotus, while with her four hands, two hold lotuses while two grant her devotees&#x27; wishes and assures protection from fear.

All these Mahavidyas reside in Manidvipa.

The &quot;Maha bhagavata Purana&quot; and &quot;Brihaddharma Purana&quot; however, list Shodashi (Sodasi) as Tripura Sundari, which is simply another name for the same goddess. 

The Todala-Tantra associates the Mahavidyas with the Dashavatara, the ten avatars of Vishnu, in chapter ten. They are as follows:

The Guhyati guyha-tantra associates the Mahavidyas with the Dashavatara differently, and states that the Mahavidyas are the source from which the avatars of Vishnu arise.

&quot;Note&quot;: In the above list do not get confused the names of Matanga Bhairava with Matanga Rishi, and Narada Bhairava with Narada Rishi.

<text>A* (pronounced &quot;A-star&quot;) is a graph traversal and pathfinding algorithm that is used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency. Given a weighted graph, a source node and a goal node, the algorithm finds the shortest path (with respect to the given weights) from source to goal.

One major practical drawback is its formula_1 space complexity where is the depth of the solution (the length of the shortest path) and is the branching factor (the maximum number of successors for a state), as it stores all generated nodes in memory. Thus, in practical travel-routing systems, it is generally outperformed by algorithms that can pre-process the graph to attain better performance, as well as by memory-bounded approaches; however, A* is still the best solution in many cases.

Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson and Bertram Raphael of Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) first published the algorithm in 1968. It can be seen as an extension of Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm. A* achieves better performance by using heuristics to guide its search.

Compared to Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm, the A* algorithm only finds the shortest path from a specified source to a specified goal, and not the shortest-path tree from a specified source to all possible goals. This is a necessary trade-off for using a specific-goal-directed heuristic. For Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm, since the entire shortest-path tree is generated, every node is a goal, and there can be no specific-goal-directed heuristic.

==History==

A* was created as part of the Shakey project, which had the aim of building a mobile robot that could plan its own actions. Nils Nilsson originally proposed using the Graph Traverser algorithm for Shakey&#x27;s path planning. Graph Traverser is guided by a heuristic function , the estimated distance from node to the goal node: it entirely ignores , the distance from the start node to . Bertram Raphael suggested using the sum, . Peter Hart invented the concepts we now call admissibility and consistency of heuristic functions. A* was originally designed for finding least-cost paths when the cost of a path is the sum of its costs, but it has been shown that A* can be used to find optimal paths for any problem satisfying the conditions of a cost algebra.

The original 1968 A* paper contained a theorem stating that no A*-like algorithm could expand fewer nodes than A* if the heuristic function is consistent and A*&#x27;s tie-breaking rule is suitably chosen. A &quot;correction&quot; was published a few years later claiming that consistency was not required, but this was shown to be false in 1985 in Dechter and Pearl&#x27;s definitive study of A*&#x27;s optimality (now called optimal efficiency), which gave an example of A* with a heuristic that was admissible but not consistent expanding arbitrarily more nodes than an alternative A*-like algorithm.

==Description==


A* is an informed search algorithm, or a best-first search, meaning that it is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific starting node of a graph, it aims to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.). It does this by maintaining a tree of paths originating at the start node and extending those paths one edge at a time until the goal node is reached.

At each iteration of its main loop, A* needs to determine which of its paths to extend. It does so based on the cost of the path and an estimate of the cost required to extend the path all the way to the goal. Specifically, A* selects the path that minimizes

:formula_2

where is the next node on the path, is the cost of the path from the start node to , and is a heuristic function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from to the goal. The heuristic function is problem-specific. If the heuristic function is admissible – meaning that it never overestimates the actual cost to get to the goal – A* is guaranteed to return a least-cost path from start to goal.

Typical implementations of A* use a priority queue to perform the repeated selection of minimum (estimated) cost nodes to expand. This priority queue is known as the &quot;open set&quot;, &quot;fringe&quot; or &quot;frontier&quot;. At each step of the algorithm, the node with the lowest value is removed from the queue, the and values of its neighbors are updated accordingly, and these neighbors are added to the queue. The algorithm continues until a removed node (thus the node with the lowest value out of all fringe nodes) is a goal node. The value of that goal is then also the cost of the shortest path, since at the goal is zero in an admissible heuristic.

The algorithm described so far only gives the length of the shortest path. To find the actual sequence of steps, the algorithm can be easily revised so that each node on the path keeps track of its predecessor. After this algorithm is run, the ending node will point to its predecessor, and so on, until some node&#x27;s predecessor is the start node.

As an example, when searching for the shortest route on a map, might represent the straight-line distance to the goal, since that is physically the smallest possible distance between any two points. For a grid map from a video game, using the Taxicab distance or the Chebyshev distance becomes better depending on the set of movements available (4-way or 8-way).

If the heuristic satisfies the additional condition for every edge of the graph (where denotes the length of that edge), then is called monotone, or consistent. With a consistent heuristic, A* is guaranteed to find an optimal path without processing any node more than once and A* is equivalent to running Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm with the reduced cost .

===Pseudocode===
The following pseudocode describes the algorithm:
function reconstruct_path(cameFrom, current)
 total_path := {current}
 while current in cameFrom.Keys:
 current := cameFrom[current]
 total_path.prepend(current)
 return total_path

// A* finds a path from start to goal.
// h is the heuristic function. h(n) estimates the cost to reach goal from node n.
function A_Star(start, goal, h)
 // The set of discovered nodes that may need to be (re-)expanded.
 // Initially, only the start node is known.
 // This is usually implemented as a min-heap or priority queue rather than a hash-set.
 openSet := {start}

 // For node n, cameFrom[n] is the node immediately preceding it on the cheapest path from the start
 // to n currently known.
 cameFrom := an empty map

 // For node n, gScore[n] is the currently known cost of the cheapest path from start to n.
 gScore := map with default value of Infinity
 gScore[start] := 0

 // For node n, fScore[n] := gScore[n] + h(n). fScore[n] represents our current best guess as to
 // how cheap a path could be from start to finish if it goes through n.
 fScore := map with default value of Infinity
 fScore[start] := h(start)

 while openSet is not empty
 // This operation can occur in O(Log(N)) time if openSet is a min-heap or a priority queue
 current := the node in openSet having the lowest fScore[] value
 if current = goal
 return reconstruct_path(cameFrom, current)

 openSet.Remove(current)
 for each neighbor of current
 // d(current,neighbor) is the weight of the edge from current to neighbor
 // tentative_gScore is the distance from start to the neighbor through current
 tentative_gScore := gScore[current] + d(current, neighbor)
 if tentative_gScore &lt; gScore[neighbor]
 // This path to neighbor is better than any previous one. Record it!
 cameFrom[neighbor] := current
 gScore[neighbor] := tentative_gScore
 fScore[neighbor] := tentative_gScore + h(neighbor)
 if neighbor not in openSet
 openSet.add(neighbor)

 // Open set is empty but goal was never reached
 return failure
Remark: In this pseudocode, if a node is reached by one path, removed from openSet, and subsequently reached by a cheaper path, it will be added to openSet again. This is essential to guarantee that the path returned is optimal if the heuristic function is admissible but not consistent. If the heuristic is consistent, when a node is removed from openSet the path to it is guaranteed to be optimal so the test ‘codice_1’ will always fail if the node is reached again.

===Example===
An example of an A* algorithm in action where nodes are cities connected with roads and h(x) is the straight-line distance to the target point:

Key: green: start; blue: goal; orange: visited

The A* algorithm has real-world applications. In this example, edges are railroads and h(x) is the great-circle distance (the shortest possible distance on a sphere) to the target. The algorithm is searching for a path between Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles.

===Implementation details===
There are a number of simple optimizations or implementation details that can significantly affect the performance of an A* implementation. The first detail to note is that the way the priority queue handles ties can have a significant effect on performance in some situations. If ties are broken so the queue behaves in a LIFO manner, A* will behave like depth-first search among equal cost paths (avoiding exploring more than one equally optimal solution).

When a path is required at the end of the search, it is common to keep with each node a reference to that node&#x27;s parent. At the end of the search, these references can be used to recover the optimal path. If these references are being kept then it can be important that the same node doesn&#x27;t appear in the priority queue more than once (each entry corresponding to a different path to the node, and each with a different cost). A standard approach here is to check if a node about to be added already appears in the priority queue. If it does, then the priority and parent pointers are changed to correspond to the lower-cost path. A standard binary heap based priority queue does not directly support the operation of searching for one of its elements, but it can be augmented with a hash table that maps elements to their position in the heap, allowing this decrease-priority operation to be performed in logarithmic time. Alternatively, a Fibonacci heap can perform the same decrease-priority operations in constant amortized time.

===Special cases===
Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm, as another example of a uniform-cost search algorithm, can be viewed as a special case of A* where for all &quot;x&quot;. General depth-first search can be implemented using A* by considering that there is a global counter &quot;C&quot; initialized with a very large value. Every time we process a node we assign &quot;C&quot; to all of its newly discovered neighbors. After every single assignment, we decrease the counter &quot;C&quot; by one. Thus the earlier a node is discovered, the higher its value. Both Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm and depth-first search can be implemented more efficiently without including an value at each node.

==Properties==

===Termination and completeness===
On finite graphs with non-negative edge weights A* is guaranteed to terminate and is &quot;complete&quot;, i.e. it will always find a solution (a path from start to goal) if one exists. On infinite graphs with a finite branching factor and edge costs that are bounded away from zero (formula_3 for some fixed formula_4), A* is guaranteed to terminate only if there exists a solution.

===Admissibility===
A search algorithm is said to be &quot;admissible&quot; if it is guaranteed to return an optimal solution. If the heuristic function used by A* is admissible, then A* is admissible. An intuitive &quot;proof&quot; of this is as follows:

Call a node &quot;closed&quot; if it has been visited and is not in the open set. We &quot;close&quot; a node when we remove it from the open set. A basic property of the A* algorithm, which we&#x27;ll sketch a proof of below, is that when is closed, is an optimistic estimate (lower bound) of the true distance from the start to the goal. So when the goal node, , is closed, is no more than the true distance. On the other hand, it is no less than the true distance, since it is the length of a path to the goal plus a heuristic term.

Now we&#x27;ll see that whenever a node is closed, is an optimistic estimate. It is enough to see that whenever the open set is not empty, it has at least one node on an optimal path to the goal for which is the true distance from start, since in that case + underestimates the distance to goal, and therefore so does the smaller value chosen for the closed vertex. Let be an optimal path from the start to the goal. Let be the last closed node on for which is the true distance from the start to the goal (the start is one such vertex). The next node in has the correct value, since it was updated when was closed, and it is open since it is not closed.

===Optimality and consistency===

Algorithm A is optimally efficient with respect to a set of alternative algorithms Alts on a set of problems P if for every problem P in P and every algorithm A′ in Alts, the set of nodes expanded by A in solving P is a subset (possibly equal) of the set of nodes expanded by A′ in solving P. The definitive study of the optimal efficiency of A* is due to Rina Dechter and Judea Pearl.
They considered a variety of definitions of Alts and P in combination with A*&#x27;s heuristic being merely admissible or being both consistent and admissible. The most interesting positive result they proved is that A*, with a consistent heuristic, is optimally efficient with respect to all admissible A*-like search algorithms on all &quot;non-pathological&quot; search problems. Roughly speaking, their notion of the non-pathological problem is what we now mean by &quot;up to tie-breaking&quot;. This result does not hold if A*&#x27;s heuristic is admissible but not consistent. In that case, Dechter and Pearl showed there exist admissible A*-like algorithms that can expand arbitrarily fewer nodes than A* on some non-pathological problems.

Optimal efficiency is about the &quot;set&quot; of nodes expanded, not the &quot;number&quot; of node expansions (the number of iterations of A*&#x27;s main loop). When the heuristic being used is admissible but not consistent, it is possible for a node to be expanded by A* many times, an exponential number of times in the worst case.
In such circumstances, Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm could outperform A* by a large margin. However, more recent research found that this pathological case only occurs in certain contrived situations where the edge weight of the search graph is exponential in the size of the graph and that certain inconsistent (but admissible) heuristics can lead to a reduced number of node expansions in A* searches.

==Bounded relaxation==

While the admissibility criterion guarantees an optimal solution path, it also means that A* must examine all equally meritorious paths to find the optimal path. To compute approximate shortest paths, it is possible to speed up the search at the expense of optimality by relaxing the admissibility criterion. Oftentimes we want to bound this relaxation, so that we can guarantee that the solution path is no worse than (1 + &quot;ε&quot;) times the optimal solution path. This new guarantee is referred to as &quot;ε&quot;-admissible.

There are a number of &quot;ε&quot;-admissible algorithms:

*Weighted A*/Static Weighting&#x27;s. If &quot;ha&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is an admissible heuristic function, in the weighted version of the A* search one uses , as the heuristic function, and perform the A* search as usual (which eventually happens faster than using &quot;ha&quot; since fewer nodes are expanded). The path hence found by the search algorithm can have a cost of at most &quot;ε&quot; times that of the least cost path in the graph.
* Dynamic Weighting uses the cost function , where formula_5, and where is the depth of the search and &quot;N&quot; is the anticipated length of the solution path.
* Sampled Dynamic Weighting uses sampling of nodes to better estimate and debias the heuristic error.
* formula_6. uses two heuristic functions. The first is the FOCAL list, which is used to select candidate nodes, and the second &quot;hF&quot; is used to select the most promising node from the FOCAL list.
* &quot;Aε&quot; selects nodes with the function , where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are constants. If no nodes can be selected, the algorithm will backtrack with the function , where &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are constants.
* AlphA* attempts to promote depth-first exploitation by preferring recently expanded nodes. AlphA* uses the cost function formula_7, where formula_8, where &quot;λ&quot; and &quot;Λ&quot; are constants with formula_9, &quot;π&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the parent of &quot;n&quot;, and &quot;ñ&quot; is the most recently expanded node.

==Complexity==
The time complexity of A* depends on the heuristic. In the worst case of an unbounded search space, the number of nodes expanded is exponential in the depth of the solution (the shortest path) : , where is the branching factor (the average number of successors per state). This assumes that a goal state exists at all, and is reachable from the start state; if it is not, and the state space is infinite, the algorithm will not terminate.

The heuristic function has a major effect on the practical performance of A* search, since a good heuristic allows A* to prune away many of the nodes that an uninformed search would expand. Its quality can be expressed in terms of the &quot;effective&quot; branching factor , which can be determined empirically for a problem instance by measuring the number of nodes generated by expansion, , and the depth of the solution, then solving

:formula_10

Good heuristics are those with low effective branching factor (the optimal being ).

The time complexity is polynomial when the search space is a tree, there is a single goal state, and the heuristic function &quot;h&quot; meets the following condition:

:formula_11

where is the optimal heuristic, the exact cost to get from to the goal. In other words, the error of will not grow faster than the logarithm of the &quot;perfect heuristic&quot; that returns the true distance from to the goal.

The space complexity of A* is roughly the same as that of all other graph search algorithms, as it keeps all generated nodes in memory. In practice, this turns out to be the biggest drawback of the A* search, leading to the development of memory-bounded heuristic searches, such as Iterative deepening A*, memory-bounded A*, and SMA*.

==Applications==
A* is often used for the common pathfinding problem in applications such as video games, but was originally designed as a general graph traversal algorithm.
It finds applications in diverse problems, including the problem of parsing using stochastic grammars in NLP.
Other cases include an Informational search with online learning.

==Relations to other algorithms==
What sets A* apart from a greedy best-first search algorithm is that it takes the cost/distance already traveled, , into account.

Some common variants of Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm can be viewed as a special case of A* where the heuristic formula_12 for all nodes; in turn, both Dijkstra and A* are special cases of dynamic programming.
A* itself is a special case of a generalization of branch and bound.

A* is similar to beam search except that beam search maintains a limit on the numbers of paths that it has to explore.

==Variants==
*Anytime A*
*Block A*
*D*
*Field D*
*Fringe
*Fringe Saving A* (FSA*)
*Generalized Adaptive A* (GAA*)
*Incremental heuristic search
*Reduced A*
*Iterative deepening A* (IDA*)
*Jump point search
*Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*)
*New Bidirectional A* (NBA*)
*Simplified Memory bounded A* (SMA*)
*Theta*

A* can also be adapted to a bidirectional search algorithm, but special care needs to be taken for the stopping criterion.

<doc id="100559" wikidata="Q1207774" url="?curid=100559" title="Dhumavati">
<text>Dhumavati (, , literally &quot;the smoky one&quot;) is one of the Mahavidyas, a group of ten Hindu Tantric goddesses. Dhumavati represents the fearsome aspect of Mahadevi, the supreme goddess in Hindu traditions such as Shaktism. She is often portrayed as an old, ugly widow, and is associated with things considered inauspicious and unattractive in Hinduism, such as the crow and the &quot;chaturmasya&quot; period. The goddess is often depicted carrying a winnowing basket on a horseless chariot or riding a crow, usually in a cremation ground.

Dhumavati is said to manifest herself at the time of cosmic dissolution (pralaya) and is &quot;the Void&quot; that exists before creation and after dissolution. While Dhumavati is generally associated with only inauspicious qualities, her thousand-name hymn relates her positive aspects as well as her negative ones. She is often called tender-hearted and a bestower of boons. Dhumavati is described as a great teacher, one who reveals ultimate knowledge of the universe, which is beyond the illusory divisions, like auspicious and inauspicious. Her ugly form teaches the devotee to look beyond the superficial, to look inwards and seek the inner truths of life.

Dhumavati is described as a giver of &quot;siddhis&quot; (supernatural powers), a rescuer from all troubles, and a granter of all desires and rewards, including ultimate knowledge and moksha (salvation). Her worship is also prescribed for those who wish to defeat their foes. Dhumavati&#x27;s worship is considered ideal for unpaired members of society, such as bachelors, widows, and world renouncers as well as &quot;Tantrikas&quot;. In her Varanasi temple, however, she transcends her inauspiciousness and acquires the status of a local protective deity, where she is also worshipped by married couples. Although she has very few dedicated temples, her worship by Tantric ritual continues in private in secluded places like cremation grounds and forests.

==Origins==
Dhumavati hardly has an independent existence outside the Mahavidya group. There is no historical mention of her before she is included among the Mahavidyas. As a goddess of poverty, frustration, and despair, Daniélou associates Dhumavati with Nirriti, the goddess of disease and misery, and Alakshmi, the goddess of misfortune and poverty. Kinsley adds another goddess to the list: Jyestha.

The Vedic goddess Nirriti is associated with death, decay, bad luck, anger, and need. Hymns emphasize offerings to keep her away. Like Nirriti, Dhumavati is associated with unpromising things and hardship. Jyestha, also an early Hindu goddess, has similarities in iconography with Dhumavati. Like Dhumavati, she is dark, ugly and is associated with the crow. Jyestha is described as being unable to tolerate any auspiciousness. Also like Dhumavati, Jyestha dwells in quarrels, inauspicious places, and has a bad temper. Lakshmana Desika, the commentator on the &quot;Saradatilaka-Tantra&quot;, identifies Dhumavati with Jyestha. Both Alakshmi, the sister and antithesis of Lakshmi (Shri), the goddess of wealth, luck and beauty, and Dhumavati are described as old, carrying a broom and having a crow banner. Both symbolize hunger, thirst, need, and poverty.

While there are similarities between Dhumavati and the three goddesses, the latter lack significant characteristics of Dhumavati, like her widowhood and a textual emphasis on her ugliness. The names of the three goddesses also do not figure in Dhumavati&#x27;s &quot;nama stotras&quot; (hymns invoking her many names), where such identifications could have been explicitly mentioned. The three also lack the more fierce warrior aspects of Dhumavati as well as her positive aspects in the context of the Mahavidyas. In scholar David Kinsley&#x27;s opinion, though the three may be Dhumavati&#x27;s antecedents, they are not &quot;the same&quot; as Dhumavati. According to Kinsley, the concept of ten Mahavidyas may not be earlier than the 12th century.

==Legends==
Dhumavati is often named as the seventh Mahavidya. The &quot;Guhyatiguhya-Tantra&quot; equates Vishnu&#x27;s ten avatars with the ten Mahavidyas. The fish incarnation Matsya is described as arising from Dhumavati. A similar list in the &quot;Mundamala&quot; equates Dhumavati with Vamana.

In a story from the Shakta &quot;Maha-Bhagavata Purana&quot;, which narrates the creation of all the Mahavidyas, Sati, the daughter of Daksha and first wife of god Shiva, feels insulted that she and Shiva are not invited to Daksha&#x27;s yagna (&quot;fire sacrifice&quot;) and insists on going there, despite Shiva&#x27;s protests. After futile attempts to convince Shiva, the enraged Sati transforms into the Mahavidyas, who surround Shiva from the ten cardinal directions. Dhumavati stands in the southeast. Another similar legend replaces Sati with Kali (the chief Mahavidya) as the wife of Shiva and origin of the other Mahavidyas. The &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot; mentions the Mahavidyas as war-companions and forms of goddess Shakambhari.

A legend from the &quot;Shaktisamgama-Tantra&quot; describes that Sati commits suicide by jumping in Daksha&#x27;s &quot;yagna&quot; and Dhumavati rises with a blackened face from the sad smoke of Sati&#x27;s burning body. She is &quot;all that is left of Sati&quot; and is her outraged and insulted avatar. The &quot;Pranatosini-Tantra&quot; explains the widowhood of Dhumavati. Once, Sati asked Shiva to give her food. When Shiva declines, the goddess eats him to satisfy her extreme hunger. When Shiva requests her to disgorge him, she obliges. Shiva then rejects her and curses her to assume the form of a widow. Another oral legend tells that Dhumavati was created by the warrior goddess Durga in the battle against demons Shumbha and Nishumbha. Dhumavati&#x27;s literal name (&quot;she who abides in smoke&quot;) comes from her ability to defeat demons by creating stinging smoke.

The &quot;Pranatosini-Tantra&quot; version stresses Dhumavati&#x27;s destructive aspect and hunger, which is satisfied only when she consumes Shiva, who himself contains or creates the universe. It brings out her inauspicious status as a widow and her self-assertion on her husband.

==Iconography and textual descriptions==
The &quot;Dhumavati Tantra&quot; describes her as an old and ugly widow. She is thin, tall, unhealthy, and has a pale-grey complexion. She is described as restless and wicked. Unadorned with jewellery, she wears old, dirty clothes and has dishevelled hair. Her eyes are fearsome, her nose long and crooked, and some of her long fang-like teeth have fallen out, leaving her smile with gaps. Her ears are ugly and rough; her breasts hang down. In one of her trembling hands, she holds a winnowing basket, while the other makes a boon-conferring gesture (&quot;varada-mudra&quot;) or knowledge-giving gesture (&quot;cinmudra&quot;). She rides in a horseless chariot bearing an emblem of a crow and a banner. She is astute and crafty, though. Always hungry and thirsty, Dhumavati initiates quarrels and invokes fear.

In the &quot;Prapancasarasara-samgraha&quot;, Dhumavati is described as having a black complexion and wearing ornaments made of snakes. Her dress is made of rags taken from cremation grounds. She holds a spear and a skull-cup (kapala) in her two hands. The spear is sometimes replaced by a sword. Another description in the same text says Dhumavati is aged with a wrinkled, angry face and cloud-like complexion. Her nose, eyes, and throat resemble a crow&#x27;s. She holds a broom, a winnowing fan, a torch, and a club. She is cruel and frowning. Her hair appears dishevelled and she wears the simple clothes of a beggar. Her breasts are dry. Her hair is grey, her teeth crooked and missing, and her clothes old and worn.

Sometimes, Dhumavati rides a crow and holds a trident. She may be depicted wearing a garland of severed heads, with red-coloured limbs and matted but dishevelled hair. Sometimes, she carries the buffalo-horn of Yama, the god of death, symbolizing her association with death.

Dhumavati has fierce, warlike attributes too. In the &quot;Shakta pramoda&quot;, she crushes bones in her mouth, creating an awful noise. She also makes the fearful and warlike noises of drums and bells. She wears a garland of skulls, chews the corpses of the demons Chanda and Munda, and drinks a mixture of blood and wine.

Though there are standard descriptions of Dhumavati&#x27;s form, some relatively recent paintings deviate from it. For example, an 18th-century painting by Molaram depicts Dhumavati sitting on a chariot pulled by two black scavenger birds with curved beaks. The painting follows the usual attributes like the winnowing basket, boon-giving gesture, but also depicts her young and beautiful with full breasts and adorned in gold finery, a stark contrast to her usual form. An early 20th-century painting from Varanasi depicts her riding a crow, holding a trident, a sword, a winnowing fan, and a bowl in her four arms, dark-complexioned, with sagging breasts, wearing white clothes and with cremation flames in the background. She is again adorned in gold finery and wears a gold-hewn lower garment, unusual for a widow&#x27;s dress. Another 18th-century Nepali manuscript depicts a complete deviation from her traditional descriptions. She is completely nude with high breasts, wears a pearl necklace and headband, stands on a peacock with legs apart, and holds a mirror while looking at her reflection. A ring of fire surrounds her, possibly conveying cremation flames.

==Symbolism and associations==
Vedic scholar Ganapati Muni described the goddess:
Dhumavati is always considered a widow, and thus, is the only Mahavidya without a consort. Though associated with Shiva, having eaten him, he has since left her. Having destroyed the male element (Purusha) in the universe, she is left with nothing, but she is still Shakti, the female element with latent energy. Dhumavati&#x27;s insatiable hunger and thirst is highlighted in many texts, and has been interpreted as the manifestation of her unsatisfied desires.

As a widow in a horseless chariot, Dhumavati is portrayed as a woman going nowhere in life and society. She is &quot;all that is unlucky, unattractive and inauspicious&quot;. She appears in the form of the poor, the beggars, the lepers, and the diseased. She dwells in the &quot;wounds of the world&quot;, deserts, ruined houses, poverty, tatters, hunger, thirst, quarrels, mourning of children, in wild and other uncivilized, dangerous places. Widows in general are considered inauspicious, dangerous, and susceptible to possession by evil spirits. As a divine widow, Dhumavati is to be feared. Dhumavati is described as a hag or witch, crafty and quarrelsome; she represents all the dreaded miseries of life.

Alternative paintings show her as young and adorned, as a sexually tempting, eroticised, young, attractive yet inauspicious widow. Her thousand-name hymn says that she gives enjoyment, is completely beautiful and adorned with garlands, clothes, and jewellery. She is also associated with sex in the hymn, which calls her &quot;She Whose Form Is Rati&quot;. Rati literally means &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; and also the name of the Hindu love goddess. Dhumavati is said to enjoy sexual intercourse, to be present where sexual activity is, and to be occupied with sex. She is said to like liquor (a forbidden drink), to be intoxicated, and to be worshiped by intoxicated people. She also indulges in the Tantric ritual of breaking the five taboos—the &quot;Panchamakara&quot;, which include consuming wine, meat, fish, parched grain and ritual sex.

Dhumavati is a manifestation of the anti-social and inauspicious elements in women and is an antithesis to the goddess Lakshmi. Like Alakshmi, Dhumavati rules over the four months of the rainy season, when even solar light is obscured by the evil water spirit. This coincides with Chaturmas, a period during the year when the god Vishnu sleeps. At that time, darkness rules and the soul loses its usual luster. This period is considered inauspicious, and as such as no auspicious ceremonies like marriage can take place.

The presence of the crow, a carrier of death, in her iconography as well as her textual description of having crow-like features associate her with death and inauspiciousness. Another motif in her iconography linking her with death is the presence of a cremation ground and cremation pyres in the background. Her thousand name hymn says that she lives in the cremation ground, sits on a corpse, wears ashes, and blesses those who haunt the grounds. The &quot;Prapancasarasara-samgraha&quot; relates that she wears a dress taken from a corpse. Dhumavati is the embodiment of &quot;tamas guna&quot;, associated with ignorance and darkness. She likes meat and wine, both tamasic in nature. The &quot;Pranatosinitantra&quot; associates her with &quot;tamas&quot;, when classifying the mahavidyas based on &quot;guna&quot;.

Dhumavati is often said to appear at the time of &quot;Maha-pralaya&quot;, the great dissolution of the cosmos and is equated with the dark clouds that rise during &quot;Pralaya&quot;. Her thousand name hymn also calls her by names meaning &quot;She Whose Form is Pralaya&quot;, &quot;Who Is Occupied with Pralaya&quot;, &quot;Who Creates and Causes Pralaya&quot; and &quot;Who Walks About in Pralaya&quot;. An author says that she stays even after Shiva (who is Maha-kala) (&quot;Great Time&quot; or &quot;Great Death&quot;) disappears, thus she is &quot;the Power of Time&quot;, and considered to be beyond time and space. Dhumavati represents ultimate destruction, the smoke that rises after the universe is destroyed.

The goddess&#x27; name &quot;Dhumavati&quot; means the &quot;smoky one&quot;. She is said not to like offerings burnt in a fire that is not smoky. She likes smoke from incense, offerings, and cremation pyres, as these symbolize destruction. Dhumavati also exists in the form of smoke and roams everywhere at her will.

While Dhumavati generally is associated with only inauspicious qualities, her thousand-name hymn tells about her positive aspects, too. She is often called as bestower of boons and tender-hearted. Her hymn says that she lives in the midst of women and is worshipped by them. Her hymn sings of her as the giver of children.

As an ancestor or Grandmother spirit, she embodies a great teacher and guide, granting knowledge of the ultimate truth of life and death. Her smoke hides that which is obvious, revealing hidden secrets and truths of &quot;the unknown and the unmanifest&quot;. Frawley says her outer appearance as poverty is deceptive and a mere illusion that hides the inner reality. She is &quot;the good fortune that comes to us in the form of misfortune&quot;. Dhumavati embodies the &quot;power of suffering&quot;. Through the negative aspects that Dhumavati represents rise the virtues of patience, persistence, forgiveness, and detachment. Without the revealing of this negativity of life, it cannot be transcended and the secret truths would remain hidden under the smoky veil of illusion.

Dhumavati&#x27;s outer inauspicious, fearful form reveals the dangers of considering sensory pleasures as fulfilment-giving. The winnowing basket, used to separate the husk from the grain, symbolizes the need to separate the outer illusory form from the inner reality. Her ugly form teaches the devotee to go beyond the outer deceptive appearances and seek the inner truths of life.

Dhumavati is the primordial darkness and ignorance, from which rises the world of illusion. She represents the darkness/ignorance before creation and after decay. This ignorance, which obscures the ultimate reality, is necessary because without the realization of this ignorance, true knowledge can not be achieved. Dhumavati also represents yogic sleep (Yoganidra), the pre-creation state of consciousness, as well as the primal sleep (the Void) in which all creation would dissolve and reach ultimate reality of &quot;Brahman&quot;. This void is pure consciousness, the cessation of movements of the mind, and silence. Even Dhumavati&#x27;s ability to spread disease is also considered positive, as disease punishes the wicked and restores cosmic order. Dhumavati is also associated with the heart or middle region of the body.Dhumavati is also called &#x27;Arikshyaykar&#x27; or &#x27;one who destroys both the external as well as the internal enemy&#x27;.

Dhumavati is sometimes regarded as an older form of Kali, in which she represents timelessness and unmanifest life-force. Another tradition identifies Dhumavati with &quot;Smashana-kali&quot;, &quot;Kali who lives in the cremation ground.&quot; She is considered a terrible aspect of the Goddess and included among the Kalikula (&quot;family of Kali&quot;) goddesses. Dhumavati&#x27;s &quot;nama stotras&quot; (hymn with names of the deities) identify her with Parvati, Sati, and glorify her as a slayer of demons.
==Worship==
Though Dhumavati may seem to be a goddess to be avoided due to her inauspiciousness, she is described as tender-hearted and one who gives her devotees whatever they want. In several places, Dhumavati is described as a giver of &quot;siddhis&quot; (supernatural powers), a rescuer from all troubles and granter of all desires and rewards, including ultimate knowledge and &quot;moksha&quot; (salvation). Dhumavati&#x27;s worship is prescribed to ward off all the negativity that she stands for and to transcend the smoke screen to acquire true knowledge. By worshipping and confronting her, the embodiment of the impure, the inauspicious and outside the fringes of society, one can look beyond the arbitrary dichotomies of society and acquire ultimate knowledge to become spiritually enlightened.

Married people, however, are advised not to worship Dhumavati. It is said that her worship creates a feeling of wanting solitude and distaste of worldly things, which is considered as highest characteristics of a spiritual quest. Thus, Dhumavati&#x27;s worship is appropriate for world renouncers who roam as lone wanderers and widows who parallel the life of world renouncers. Dhumavati is also described a being partial to single persons and especially partial to widows. Widows are considered the only beings who can withstand her power.

The mantra of Dhumavati is &quot;Dhum Dhum Dhumavati Svaha&quot;, containing a repetition of her seed syllable &quot;Dhum&quot;. This mantra used in the worship of Dhumavati, sometimes with her yantra, is believed to create a protective smoke shielding the devotee from negativity and death. Her worship involves clearing one&#x27;s mind of all thoughts and leaving back the known, meditating on the unknown silence beyond, and the Void that Dhumavati represents.
The &quot;Shaktisamgama Tantra&quot; says that Dhumavati can be worshipped for the &quot;Uchhatana&quot; (eradication) of a person. A worshipper should imagine the world as well as the goddess&#x27;s mantra as grey. He should blacken his teeth and wear black clothes and observe regulations, such as eating little, sleeping on the ground, and subduing his senses. In this worship procedure called &quot;kakakarma&quot; (crow-procedure), he should &quot;transform his mind into a crow&quot; by which one can cause harm to a person. Another Tantric text mentions the worshipper should burn a crow in a cremation flame and, while repeating the goddesses&#x27; mantra, spread the ashes in the enemy&#x27;s house, which will lead to his destruction. The text further says Dhumavati should be worshipped only by Dakshinamarga (&quot;right-handed path&quot;). While &quot;the Kalarudra-tantra&quot; says Dhumavati can be worshipped for destructive purposes, &quot;Shakta-pramoda&quot; relates that her worship is useful to acquire &quot;siddhi&quot; to destroy one&#x27;s foes.

Dhumavati&#x27;s worship is performed in the night in a cremation ground, bare-bodied with the exception of a loincloth. The fourth lunar day of the dark fortnight (&quot;Krishna Paksha&quot;) is considered the special day to perform her puja (worship). The worshipper should observe a fast and remain silent for a whole day and night. They should also perform a homa (&quot;fire sacrifice&quot;), wearing wet clothes and a turban, repeating the goddess&#x27; mantra in a cremation ground, forest, or any lonely place.
Dhumavati temples are extremely rare. At a temple in Varanasi, Dhumavati is the main deity. Smaller Dhumavati temples exist in Rajrappa in Bihar and near the Kamakhya Temple near Guwahati. At the Varanasi temple, which claims to be a Shakta pitha, Dhumavati&#x27;s idol rides a chariot and holds a winnowing fan, a broom, and a pot, while the fourth hand makes the fear-not gesture (&quot;abhaya-mudra&quot;). The goddess is offered usual offerings like flowers and fruit, but also liquor, bhang, cigarettes, meat, and sometimes even blood sacrifices. Though traditional devotees of Dhumavati (world renouncers and &quot;Tantrika&quot;s) worship at the Varanasi temple, here the goddess transcends her traditional role as &quot;the inauspicious, dangerous goddess who can be approached only by heroic tantric adepts&quot;. Dhumavati acquires the role of a local guardian deity, or village deity, who protects the locals and even married couples worship her. There is also a temple dedicated to the goddess in Pitambara Peeth temple complex, Datia.

<text>A system on a chip or system-on-chip (SoC ; pl. &quot;SoCs&quot; ) is an integrated circuit that integrates most or all components of a computer or electronic system. These components usually include an on-chip central processing unit (CPU), memory interfaces, input/output devices and interfaces, and secondary storage interfaces, often alongside other components such as a Wi-Fi receiver and a graphics processing unit (GPU) – all on a single substrate or microchip. SoCs may contain digital and also analog, mixed-signal and often radio frequency signal processing functions (otherwise it may be considered on a discrete application processor).

High-performance SoCs are often paired with dedicated and physically separate memory and secondary storage (such as LPDDR and eUFS or eMMC, respectively) chips that may be layered on top of the SoC in what is known as a package on package (PoP) configuration, or be placed close to the SoC. Additionally, SoCs may paired with smaller separate chips, such as baseband modems.

An SoC usually integrates a microcontroller, microprocessor or perhaps several processor cores with peripherals like a GPU and a Wi-Fi receiver and more coprocessors. Similar to how a microcontroller integrates a microprocessor with peripheral circuits and memory, an SoC can be seen as integrating a microcontroller with even more advanced peripherals.

Compared to a multi-chip architecture, an SoC with equivalent functionality will have reduced power consumption as well as a smaller semiconductor die area. This comes at the cost of reduced replaceability of components. By definition, SoC designs are fully or nearly fully integrated across different component modules. For these reasons, there has been a general trend towards tighter integration of components in the computer hardware industry, in part due to the influence of SoCs and lessons learned from the mobile and embedded computing markets. 

SoCs are very common in the mobile computing (as in smart devices such as smartphones and tablet computers) and edge computing markets.

== Types ==

In general, there are three distinguishable types of SoCs:
* SoCs built around a microcontroller,
* SoCs built around a microprocessor, often found in mobile phones;
* Specialized application-specific integrated circuit SoCs designed for specific applications that do not fit into the above two categories.

== Applications ==
SoCs can be applied to any computing task. However, they are typically used in mobile computing such as tablets, smartphones, smartwatches, and netbooks as well as embedded systems and in applications where previously microcontrollers would be used.

=== Embedded systems ===
Where previously only microcontrollers could be used, SoCs are rising to prominence in the embedded systems market. Tighter system integration offers better reliability and mean time between failure, and SoCs offer more advanced functionality and computing power than microcontrollers. Applications include AI acceleration, embedded machine vision, data collection, telemetry, vector processing and ambient intelligence. Often embedded SoCs target the internet of things, multimedia, networking, telecommunications and edge computing markets. Some examples of SoCs for embedded applications include:

* AMD
** Zynq 7000 SoC
** Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC
** Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC
** Versal Adaptive SoC

=== Mobile computing ===

Mobile computing based SoCs always bundle processors, memories, on-chip caches, wireless networking capabilities and often digital camera hardware and firmware. With increasing memory sizes, high end SoCs will often have no memory and flash storage and instead, the memory and flash memory will be placed right next to, or above (package on package), the SoC. Some examples of mobile computing SoCs include:

* Samsung Electronics: list, typically based on ARM
** Exynos, used mainly by Samsung&#x27;s Galaxy series of smartphones
* Qualcomm:
** Snapdragon (list), used in many smartphones. In 2018, Snapdragon SoCs were being used as the backbone of laptop computers running Windows 10, marketed as &quot;Always Connected PCs&quot;.
* MediaTek, typically based on ARM
** Dimensity &amp; Kompanio Series. Standalone application &amp; tablet processors that power devices such as Amazon Echo Show

=== Personal computers ===
In 1992, Acorn Computers produced the A3010, A3020 and A4000 range of personal computers with the ARM250 SoC. It combined the original Acorn ARM2 processor with a memory controller (MEMC), video controller (VIDC), and I/O controller (IOC). In previous Acorn ARM-powered computers, these were four discrete chips. The ARM7500 chip was their second-generation SoC, based on the ARM700, VIDC20 and IOMD controllers, and was widely licensed in embedded devices such as set-top-boxes, as well as later Acorn personal computers.

Tablet and laptop manufacturers have learned lessons from embedded systems and smartphone markets about reduced power consumption, better performance and reliability from tighter integration of hardware and firmware modules, and LTE and other wireless network communications integrated on chip (integrated network interface controllers).

On modern laptops and mini PCs, the low-power variants of AMD Ryzen and Intel Core processors use SoC design integrating CPU, IGPU, chipset and other processors in a single package. However, such x86 processors still require external memory and storage chips.

== Structure ==
An SoC consists of hardware functional units, including microprocessors that run software code, as well as a communications subsystem to connect, control, direct and interface between these functional modules.

=== Functional components ===
==== Processor cores ====
An SoC must have at least one processor core, but typically an SoC has more than one core. Processor cores can be a microcontroller, microprocessor (μP), digital signal processor (DSP) or application-specific instruction set processor (ASIP) core. ASIPs have instruction sets that are customized for an application domain and designed to be more efficient than general-purpose instructions for a specific type of workload. Multiprocessor SoCs have more than one processor core by definition. The ARM architecture is a common choice for SoC processor cores because some ARM-architecture cores are soft processors specified as IP cores.

==== Memory ====

SoCs must have semiconductor memory blocks to perform their computation, as do microcontrollers and other embedded systems. Depending on the application, SoC memory may form a memory hierarchy and cache hierarchy. In the mobile computing market, this is common, but in many low-power embedded microcontrollers, this is not necessary. Memory technologies for SoCs include read-only memory (ROM), random-access memory (RAM), Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM (EEPROM) and flash memory. As in other computer systems, RAM can be subdivided into relatively faster but more expensive static RAM (SRAM) and the slower but cheaper dynamic RAM (DRAM). When an SoC has a cache hierarchy, SRAM will usually be used to implement processor registers and cores&#x27; built-in caches whereas DRAM will be used for main memory. &quot;Main memory&quot; may be specific to a single processor (which can be multi-core) when the SoC has multiple processors, in this case it is distributed memory and must be sent via on-chip to be accessed by a different processor. For further discussion of multi-processing memory issues, see cache coherence and memory latency.

==== Interfaces ====
SoCs include external interfaces, typically for communication protocols. These are often based upon industry standards such as USB, Ethernet, USART, SPI, HDMI, I²C, CSI, etc. These interfaces will differ according to the intended application. Wireless networking protocols such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 6LoWPAN and near-field communication may also be supported.

When needed, SoCs include analog interfaces including analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters, often for signal processing. These may be able to interface with different types of sensors or actuators, including smart transducers. They may interface with application-specific modules or shields. Or they may be internal to the SoC, such as if an analog sensor is built in to the SoC and its readings must be converted to digital signals for mathematical processing.

==== Digital signal processors ====
Digital signal processor (DSP) cores are often included on SoCs. They perform signal processing operations in SoCs for sensors, actuators, data collection, data analysis and multimedia processing. DSP cores typically feature very long instruction word (VLIW) and single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) instruction set architectures, and are therefore highly amenable to exploiting instruction-level parallelism through parallel processing and superscalar execution. SP cores most often feature application-specific instructions, and as such are typically application-specific instruction set processors (ASIP). Such application-specific instructions correspond to dedicated hardware functional units that compute those instructions.

Typical DSP instructions include multiply-accumulate, Fast Fourier transform, fused multiply-add, and convolutions.

==== Other ====
As with other computer systems, SoCs require timing sources to generate clock signals, control execution of SoC functions and provide time context to signal processing applications of the SoC, if needed. Popular time sources are crystal oscillators and phase-locked loops.

SoC peripherals including counter-timers, real-time timers and power-on reset generators. SoCs also include voltage regulators and power management circuits.

=== Intermodule communication ===
SoCs comprise many execution units. These units must often send data and instructions back and forth. Because of this, all but the most trivial SoCs require communications subsystems. Originally, as with other microcomputer technologies, data bus architectures were used, but recently designs based on sparse intercommunication networks known as networks-on-chip (NoC) have risen to prominence and are forecast to overtake bus architectures for SoC design in the near future.

==== Bus-based communication ====
Historically, a shared global computer bus typically connected the different components, also called &quot;blocks&quot; of the SoC. A very common bus for SoC communications is ARM&#x27;s royalty-free Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) standard.

Direct memory access controllers route data directly between external interfaces and SoC memory, bypassing the CPU or control unit, thereby increasing the data throughput of the SoC. This is similar to some device drivers of peripherals on component-based multi-chip module PC architectures.

Wire delay is not scalable due to continued miniaturization, system performance does not scale with the number of cores attached, the SoC&#x27;s operating frequency must decrease with each additional core attached for power to be sustainable, and long wires consume large amounts of electrical power. These challenges are prohibitive to supporting manycore systems on chip.

==== Network on a chip ====

In the late 2010s, a trend of SoCs implementing communications subsystems in terms of a network-like topology instead of bus-based protocols has emerged. A trend towards more processor cores on SoCs has caused on-chip communication efficiency to become one of the key factors in determining the overall system performance and cost. This has led to the emergence of interconnection networks with router-based packet switching known as &quot;networks on chip&quot; (NoCs) to overcome the bottlenecks of bus-based networks.

Networks-on-chip have advantages including destination- and application-specific routing, greater power efficiency and reduced possibility of bus contention. Network-on-chip architectures take inspiration from communication protocols like TCP and the Internet protocol suite for on-chip communication, although they typically have fewer network layers. Optimal network-on-chip network architectures are an ongoing area of much research interest. NoC architectures range from traditional distributed computing network topologies such as torus, hypercube, meshes and tree networks to genetic algorithm scheduling to randomized algorithms such as random walks with branching and randomized time to live (TTL).

Many SoC researchers consider NoC architectures to be the future of SoC design because they have been shown to efficiently meet power and throughput needs of SoC designs. Current NoC architectures are two-dimensional. 2D IC design has limited floorplanning choices as the number of cores in SoCs increase, so as three-dimensional integrated circuits (3DICs) emerge, SoC designers are looking towards building three-dimensional on-chip networks known as 3DNoCs.

== Design flow ==


A system on a chip consists of both the hardware, described in , and the software controlling the microcontroller, microprocessor or digital signal processor cores, peripherals and interfaces. The design flow for an SoC aims to develop this hardware and software at the same time, also known as architectural co-design. The design flow must also take into account optimizations () and constraints.

Most SoCs are developed from pre-qualified hardware component IP core specifications for the hardware elements and execution units, collectively &quot;blocks&quot;, described above, together with software device drivers that may control their operation. Of particular importance are the protocol stacks that drive industry-standard interfaces like USB. The hardware blocks are put together using computer-aided design tools, specifically electronic design automation tools; the software modules are integrated using a software integrated development environment.

SoCs components are also often designed in high-level programming languages such as C++, MATLAB or SystemC and converted to RTL designs through high-level synthesis (HLS) tools such as C to HDL or flow to HDL. HLS products called &quot;algorithmic synthesis&quot; allow designers to use C++ to model and synthesize system, circuit, software and verification levels all in one high level language commonly known to computer engineers in a manner independent of time scales, which are typically specified in HDL. Other components can remain software and be compiled and embedded onto soft-core processors included in the SoC as modules in HDL as IP cores.

Once the architecture of the SoC has been defined, any new hardware elements are written in an abstract hardware description language termed register transfer level (RTL) which defines the circuit behavior, or synthesized into RTL from a high level language through high-level synthesis. These elements are connected together in a hardware description language to create the full SoC design. The logic specified to connect these components and convert between possibly different interfaces provided by different vendors is called glue logic.

=== Design verification ===

Chips are verified for validation correctness before being sent to a semiconductor foundry. This process is called functional verification and it accounts for a significant portion of the time and energy expended in the chip design life cycle, often quoted as 70%. With the growing complexity of chips, hardware verification languages like SystemVerilog, SystemC, e, and OpenVera are being used. Bugs found in the verification stage are reported to the designer.

Traditionally, engineers have employed simulation acceleration, emulation or prototyping on reprogrammable hardware to verify and debug hardware and software for SoC designs prior to the finalization of the design, known as tape-out. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are favored for prototyping SoCs because FPGA prototypes are reprogrammable, allow debugging and are more flexible than application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).

With high capacity and fast compilation time, simulation acceleration and emulation are powerful technologies that provide wide visibility into systems. Both technologies, however, operate slowly, on the order of MHz, which may be significantly slower – up to 100 times slower – than the SoC&#x27;s operating frequency. Acceleration and emulation boxes are also very large and expensive at over US$1 million.

FPGA prototypes, in contrast, use FPGAs directly to enable engineers to validate and test at, or close to, a system&#x27;s full operating frequency with real-world stimuli. Tools such as Certus are used to insert probes in the FPGA RTL that make signals available for observation. This is used to debug hardware, firmware and software interactions across multiple FPGAs with capabilities similar to a logic analyzer.

In parallel, the hardware elements are grouped and passed through a process of logic synthesis, during which performance constraints, such as operational frequency and expected signal delays, are applied. This generates an output known as a netlist describing the design as a physical circuit and its interconnections. These netlists are combined with the glue logic connecting the components to produce the schematic description of the SoC as a circuit which can be printed onto a chip. This process is known as place and route and precedes tape-out in the event that the SoCs are produced as application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC).

== Optimization goals ==
SoCs must optimize power use, area on die, communication, positioning for locality between modular units and other factors. Optimization is necessarily a design goal of SoCs. If optimization was not necessary, the engineers would use a multi-chip module architecture without accounting for the area use, power consumption or performance of the system to the same extent.

Common optimization targets for SoC designs follow, with explanations of each. In general, optimizing any of these quantities may be a hard combinatorial optimization problem, and can indeed be NP-hard fairly easily. Therefore, sophisticated optimization algorithms are often required and it may be practical to use approximation algorithms or heuristics in some cases. Additionally, most SoC designs contain multiple variables to optimize simultaneously, so Pareto efficient solutions are sought after in SoC design. Oftentimes the goals of optimizing some of these quantities are directly at odds, further adding complexity to design optimization of SoCs and introducing trade-offs in system design.

For broader coverage of trade-offs and requirements analysis, see requirements engineering.

=== Targets ===
==== Power consumption ====
SoCs are optimized to minimize the electrical power used to perform the SoC&#x27;s functions. Most SoCs must use low power. SoC systems often require long battery life (such as smartphones), can potentially spend months or years without a power source while needing to maintain autonomous function, and often are limited in power use by a high number of embedded SoCs being networked together in an area. Additionally, energy costs can be high and conserving energy will reduce the total cost of ownership of the SoC. Finally, waste heat from high energy consumption can damage other circuit components if too much heat is dissipated, giving another pragmatic reason to conserve energy. The amount of energy used in a circuit is the integral of power consumed with respect to time, and the average rate of power consumption is the product of current by voltage. Equivalently, by Ohm&#x27;s law, power is current squared times resistance or voltage squared divided by resistance:

formula_1SoCs are frequently embedded in portable devices such as smartphones, GPS navigation devices, digital watches (including smartwatches) and netbooks. Customers want long battery lives for mobile computing devices, another reason that power consumption must be minimized in SoCs. Multimedia applications are often executed on these devices, including video games, video streaming, image processing; all of which have grown in computational complexity in recent years with user demands and expectations for higher-quality multimedia. Computation is more demanding as expectations move towards 3D video at high resolution with multiple standards, so SoCs performing multimedia tasks must be computationally capable platform while being low power to run off a standard mobile battery.

==== Performance per watt ====

SoCs are optimized to maximize power efficiency in performance per watt: maximize the performance of the SoC given a budget of power usage. Many applications such as edge computing, distributed processing and ambient intelligence require a certain level of computational performance, but power is limited in most SoC environments. 

==== Waste heat ====

SoC designs are optimized to minimize waste heat output on the chip. As with other integrated circuits, heat generated due to high power density are the bottleneck to further miniaturization of components. The power densities of high speed integrated circuits, particularly microprocessors and including SoCs, have become highly uneven. Too much waste heat can damage circuits and erode reliability of the circuit over time. High temperatures and thermal stress negatively impact reliability, stress migration, decreased mean time between failures, electromigration, wire bonding, metastability and other performance degradation of the SoC over time.

In particular, most SoCs are in a small physical area or volume and therefore the effects of waste heat are compounded because there is little room for it to diffuse out of the system. Because of high transistor counts on modern devices, oftentimes a layout of sufficient throughput and high transistor density is physically realizable from fabrication processes but would result in unacceptably high amounts of heat in the circuit&#x27;s volume.

These thermal effects force SoC and other chip designers to apply conservative design margins, creating less performant devices to mitigate the risk of catastrophic failure. Due to increased transistor densities as length scales get smaller, each process generation produces more heat output than the last. Compounding this problem, SoC architectures are usually heterogeneous, creating spatially inhomogeneous heat fluxes, which cannot be effectively mitigated by uniform passive cooling.

==== Throughput ====

SoCs are optimized to maximize computational and communications throughput.

==== Latency ====

SoCs are optimized to minimize latency for some or all of their functions. This can be accomplished by laying out elements with proper proximity and locality to each-other to minimize the interconnection delays and maximize the speed at which data is communicated between modules, functional units and memories. In general, optimizing to minimize latency is an NP-complete problem equivalent to the Boolean satisfiability problem.

For tasks running on processor cores, latency and throughput can be improved with task scheduling. Some tasks run in application-specific hardware units, however, and even task scheduling may not be sufficient to optimize all software-based tasks to meet timing and throughput constraints.

=== Methodologies ===
Systems on chip are modeled with standard hardware verification and validation techniques, but additional techniques are used to model and optimize SoC design alternatives to make the system optimal with respect to multiple-criteria decision analysis on the above optimization targets.

==== Task scheduling ====
Task scheduling is an important activity in any computer system with multiple processes or threads sharing a single processor core. It is important to reduce and increase for embedded software running on an SoC&#x27;s . Not every important computing activity in a SoC is performed in software running on on-chip processors, but scheduling can drastically improve performance of software-based tasks and other tasks involving shared resources.

Software running on SoCs often schedules tasks according to network scheduling and randomized scheduling algorithms.

==== Pipelining ====

Hardware and software tasks are often pipelined in processor design. Pipelining is an important principle for speedup in computer architecture. They are frequently used in GPUs (graphics pipeline) and RISC processors (evolutions of the classic RISC pipeline), but are also applied to application-specific tasks such as digital signal processing and multimedia manipulations in the context of SoCs.

==== Probabilistic modeling ====
SoCs are often analyzed though probabilistic models, queueing networks, and Markov chains. For instance, Little&#x27;s law allows SoC states and NoC buffers to be modeled as arrival processes and analyzed through Poisson random variables and Poisson processes.

==== Markov chains ====
SoCs are often modeled with Markov chains, both discrete time and continuous time variants. Markov chain modeling allows asymptotic analysis of the SoC&#x27;s steady state distribution of power, heat, latency and other factors to allow design decisions to be optimized for the common case.

== Fabrication ==
SoC chips are typically fabricated using metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) technology. The netlists described above are used as the basis for the physical design (place and route) flow to convert the designers&#x27; intent into the design of the SoC. Throughout this conversion process, the design is analyzed with static timing modeling, simulation and other tools to ensure that it meets the specified operational parameters such as frequency, power consumption and dissipation, functional integrity (as described in the register transfer level code) and electrical integrity.

When all known bugs have been rectified and these have been re-verified and all physical design checks are done, the physical design files describing each layer of the chip are sent to the foundry&#x27;s mask shop where a full set of glass lithographic masks will be etched. These are sent to a wafer fabrication plant to create the SoC dice before packaging and testing.

SoCs can be fabricated by several technologies, including:
* Full custom ASIC
* Standard cell ASIC
* Field-programmable gate array (FPGA)

ASICs consume less power and are faster than FPGAs but cannot be reprogrammed and are expensive to manufacture. FPGA designs are more suitable for lower volume designs, but after enough units of production ASICs reduce the total cost of ownership.

SoC designs consume less power and have a lower cost and higher reliability than the multi-chip systems that they replace. With fewer packages in the system, assembly costs are reduced as well.

However, like most very-large-scale integration (VLSI) designs, the total cost is higher for one large chip than for the same functionality distributed over several smaller chips, because of lower yields and higher non-recurring engineering costs.

When it is not feasible to construct an SoC for a particular application, an alternative is a system in package (SiP) comprising a number of chips in a single package. When produced in large volumes, SoC is more cost-effective than SiP because its packaging is simpler. Another reason SiP may be preferred is waste heat may be too high in a SoC for a given purpose because functional components are too close together, and in an SiP heat will dissipate better from different functional modules since they are physically further apart.

<text>Bharadvaja (, ; also spelled Bharadwaja) was one of the revered Vedic sages
(maharishi) in Ancient India. He was a renowned scholar, economist, grammarian and a physician. He is one of the Saptarishis (seven great sages or Maharṣis).

His contributions to ancient Indian literature, specifically the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, provide significant insight into ancient Vedic society. He and his family of students were the authors of Mandala 6 in the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. In the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Bharadvaja was the father of Droṇācārya, the guru and instructor to the Pandava and Kaurava princes in the Mahabharata. Bharadvaja is also mentioned in &quot;Charaka Samhita&quot;, an authoritative ancient Indian medical text.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Bharadvaja&quot; is a compound Sanskrit from &quot;&quot;bhara(d)&quot; and &quot;vaja(m)&quot;&quot;, which together mean &quot;bringing about nourishment&quot;. The name lends itself to more than one yoga asana called Bharadvajasana (&quot;nourishing pose&quot;) named after the eponymous sage.

==Description==
His full name in Vedic texts is &quot;Bharadvaja Barhaspatya&quot;, the last name referring to his father and Vedic deity-sage Brihaspati. His mother was Mamata, wife of Utathya Rishi, who was the elder brother of Barhaspati. In the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, he is named as Vitatha. He is one of seven rishis mentioned four times in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; as well as in the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot;, thereafter revered in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Puranas&quot;. In some later Puranic legends, he is described as the son of Vedic sage Atri.

In Buddhist Pali canonical texts such as &quot;Digha Nikaya&quot;, Tevijja Sutta describes a discussion between the Buddha and Vedic scholars of his time. The Buddha names ten rishis, calls them &quot;early sages&quot; and makers of ancient verses that have been collected and chanted in his era, and among those ten rishis is Bharadvaja.

The ancient Hindu medical treatise &quot;Charaka Samhita&quot; attributes Bharadvaja learning medical sciences to Indra, after pleading that &quot;poor health was disrupting the ability of human beings from pursuing their spiritual journey&quot;, and then Indra provides both the method and specifics of medical knowledge.

Bharadvaja is considered to be the initiator of the &quot;Bharadvāja&quot; gotra of the Brahmins, Khatris, &quot;Bharadvaja&quot; is the third in the row of the Pravara Rishis (&quot;Aangirasa&quot;, &quot;Barhaspatya&quot;, &quot;Bharadvaja&quot;) and is the first in the &quot;Bharadvaja Gotris&quot;, with the other two rishis being initiators of Gotras with their respective names.

==Texts==
Bharadvaja and his family of students are 55. Bharadvaja and his family of students were the traditional poets of king Marutta of the Vedic era, in the Hindu texts.

Bharadvaja is a revered sage in the Hindu traditions, and like other revered sages, numerous treatises composed in the ancient and medieval eras are reverentially named after him. Some treatises named after him or attributed to him include:
* &quot;Dhanur-veda&quot;, credited to Bharadvaja in chapter 12.203 of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, is an Upaveda treatise on archery.
* &quot;Bharadvaja samhita&quot;, a Pancharatra text (an Agama text of Vaishnavism).
* &quot;Bharadvaja srautasutra and grhyasutra&quot;, a ritual and rites of passage text from first millennium BCE. After the &quot;Kalpasutra&quot; by Baudhayana, these Bharadvaja texts are among the oldest &quot;srauta&quot; and &quot;grhya&quot; sutras known.
* Sections in &quot;Ayurveda&quot;. Bharadvaja theories on medicine and causal phenomenon is described in &quot;Charaka Samhita&quot;. Bharadvaja states, for example, that an embryo is not caused by wish, prayers, urging of mind or mystical causes, but it is produced from the union of a man&#x27;s sperm and menstrual blood of a woman at the right time of her menstrual cycle, in her womb. According to Gerrit Jan Meulenbeld, Bharadvaja is credited with many theories and practical ideas in ancient Indian medicine.
* &quot;Niti sastra&quot;, a treatise on ethics and practical conduct.
* &quot;Bharadvaja-siksa&quot;, is one of many ancient Sanskrit treatises on phonetics.

==Epics and Puranic scriptures==

According to one legend, Bharadvaja married Sushila and had a son named Garga and a daughter named Devavarshini. According to some other legends, Bharadvaja had two daughters named Ilavida and Katyayani, who married Vishrava and Yajnavalkya respectively. According to &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, Bharadvaja had a brief liaison with an apsara named Ghritachi, and together they had a child who grew up into a warrior-Brahmin named Drona. In the Mahabharata, Drona is instead born when Bharadvaja ejaculated his semen in a pot. Bharadvaja is therefore directly linked to two important characters of the epic Mahabharata — Dronacharya and Aśvatthāma, the son of Drona. According to the Mahabharata, Bharadvaja trained Drona in the use of weapons. Bharadvaja had two disciples: Agnivesa and Drupada. Agnivesa taught Drona the mastery of the weapon Agneya, while Drupada became the king of Panchala kingdom.

One legend in the Mahabharata states that King Bharata adopted Bharadvaja as his son when he was delivered to the king by the Marutas. Bharadvaja married a kshatriya woman named Sushila. According to the Bhagavata Purana, Bharadvaja beget a son named Manyu also known as Bhumanyu while in the Mahabharata Bhumanyu is born to him by a yajna.

===Rāmāyaṇa===

In the epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana meet Bharadvaja at his &quot;ashrama&quot; (hermitage) at the start of their fourteen-year exile. The sage asks them to stay with him through the exile, but they insist on going deeper into the forest to Chitrakuta, which was three krosha away from the ashram. Bharadvaja gives them directions. Bharata is received at the ashrama by Bharadvaja when attempted to locate Rama in order to bring Sita, Lakshmana, and him back to Ayodhya. He reappears at various times in the epic. According to James Lochtefeld, the Bharadvaja in the &quot;Ramayana&quot; is different from the Vedic sage mentioned in Panini&#x27;s &quot;Ashtadhyayi&quot;.

<text>Bharani (Devanagari: भरणी) is the second nakshatra in Hindu astronomy, corresponding to 35, 39, and 41 Arietis all together. In Jyotiṣa, Bharani is ruled by Shukra (the planet Venus).
Also, it is classified as a Cruel or Active nakshatra, meaning that, under electional astrological beliefs, works of a harmful or deceptive nature are best conducted while the moon is Bharani.

Bharani is seen as being under the domain of Yama, the god of death or Kālī. 

Traditional Hindu given names are determined by which pada (quarter) of a nakshatra the Ascendant/Lagna was in at the time of birth. The given name would begin with the following syllables:
*A (pronounced as in &quot;agglutination&quot;)
* Ee (pronounced as in &quot;Eel&quot;)
* Li (pronounced as in &quot;little&quot;)
*Lu (pronounced as in &quot;look&quot;)
*Le (pronounced as in &quot;levity&quot;)
*Lo (pronounced as in &quot;local&quot;)

<doc id="100571" wikidata="Q1233713" url="?curid=100571" title="Doc Savage">
<text>Doc Savage is a fictional character of the competent man hero type, who first appeared in American pulp magazines during the 1930s and 1940s. Real name Clark Savage Jr., he is a polymathic scientist, explorer, detective, and warrior who &quot;rights wrongs and punishes evildoers.&quot; He was created by publisher Henry W. Ralston and editor John L. Nanovic at Street &amp; Smith Publications, with additional material contributed by the series&#x27; main writer, Lester Dent. Doc Savage stories were published under the Kenneth Robeson name. The illustrations were by Walter Baumhofer, Paul Orban, Emery Clarke, Modest Stein, and Robert G. Harris.

The heroic-adventure character would go on to appear in other media, including radio, film, and comic books, with his adventures reprinted for modern-day audiences in a series of paperback books, which had sold over 20 million copies by 1979. Into the 21st century, Doc Savage has remained a nostalgic icon in the U.S., referenced in novels and popular culture. Longtime Marvel Comics editor Stan Lee credited Doc Savage as being the forerunner to modern superheroes.

==Publication history==
&quot;Doc Savage Magazine&quot; was printed by Street &amp; Smith from March 1933 to the summer of 1949 to capitalize on the success of &quot;The Shadow&quot; magazine and followed by the original &quot;Avenger&quot; in September 1939. In all, 181 issues were published in various entries and alternative titles.

Doc Savage became known to more contemporary readers when Bantam Books began reprinting the individual magazine novels in 1964, this time with covers by artist James Bama that featured a bronze-haired, bronze-skinned Doc Savage with an exaggerated widows&#x27; peak, usually wearing a torn khaki shirt and under the by-line &quot;Kenneth Robeson&quot;. The stories were not reprinted in chronological order as originally published, though they did begin with the first adventure, &quot;The Man of Bronze&quot;. By 1967, Bantam was publishing once a month until 1990, when all 181 original stories (plus an unpublished novel, &quot;The Red Spider&quot;) had run their course. Author Will Murray produced seven more Doc Savage novels for Bantam Books from Lester Dent&#x27;s original outlines. Bantam also published a novel by Philip José Farmer, &quot;Escape From Loki&quot; (1991), which told the story of how in World War I Doc met the men who would become his five comrades.

Clark Savage Jr. first appeared in March 1933 in the first issue of &quot;Doc Savage Magazine&quot;. Because of the success of the Shadow, who had his own pulp magazine, the publishers Street &amp; Smith quickly launched this pulp title. Unlike the Shadow, Clark Savage, &quot;Doc&quot; to his friends, had no special powers but was raised from birth by his father and other scientists to become one of the most perfect human beings in terms of strength, intelligence, and physical abilities.

Doc Savage set up base on the 86th floor of a world-famous New York skyscraper (implied, but never outright stated, as the Empire State Building; Phillip José Farmer, in his &quot;Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life&quot;, gives good evidence that this is likely the case). Doc Savage fights against evil with the assistance of the &quot;Fabulous Five&quot;.

==Comics, films, pulp magazines==
Doc Savage has appeared in comics and a movie, on radio, and as a character in numerous other works, and continues to inspire authors and artists in the realm of fantastic adventure.

&quot;Doc Savage Magazine&quot; was created by Street &amp; Smith Publications executive Henry Ralston and editor John Nanovic to capitalize on the success of Street and Smith&#x27;s pulp character, The Shadow. Ralston and Nanovic wrote a short premise establishing the broad outlines of the character they envisioned, but Doc Savage was only fully realized by the author chosen to write the series, Lester Dent. Dent wrote most of the 181 original novels, hidden behind the &quot;house name&quot; of Kenneth Robeson. (See List of Doc Savage novels for a complete list of the titles in the original pulp magazine series.) 
One Lester Dent biographer hypothesizes that one inspiration for Doc Savage may have been the American military officer and author Richard Henry Savage, who wrote more than 40 books of adventure and mystery stories and lived a dashing and daring life.

The character first appeared on screen in a 1975 film, &quot;Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze&quot;.

It was announced on May 30, 2016, that Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson would be playing Clark &quot;Doc&quot; Savage, billed as the &quot;World&#x27;s First Superhero&quot;, and the film would be directed by Shane Black with a script by Anthony Bagarozzi and Chuck Mondry. In 2020, the concept was changed from a film to a television show.

==Fictional character biography==
A team of scientists assembled by his father deliberately trained his mind and body to near-superhuman abilities almost from birth, giving him great strength and endurance, a photographic memory, a mastery of the martial arts, and vast knowledge of the sciences. Doc is also a master of disguise and an excellent imitator of voices. He is a physician, scientist, adventurer, detective, inventor, explorer, researcher, and, as revealed in &quot;The Polar Treasure&quot;, a musician. Dent described the hero as a mix of Sherlock Holmes&#x27; deductive abilities, Tarzan&#x27;s outstanding physical abilities, Craig Kennedy&#x27;s scientific education, and Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s goodness. He also described Doc Savage as manifesting &quot;Christliness.&quot; Doc&#x27;s character and world-view is displayed in his oath, which goes as follows:

By the third story, Doc already has a reputation as a &quot;superman&quot;.

===Doc Savage&#x27;s aides===
Savage is accompanied on his adventures by up to five other regular characters (referred to in the 1975 movie and in marketing materials from the Bantam Books republication as &quot;The Fabulous Five&quot;), all highly accomplished individuals in their own right.

* Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Blodgett &quot;Monk&quot; Mayfair, an industrial chemist. Monk got his nickname from his simian build, notably his long arms, and his covering of red hair. He is in a constant state of &quot;friendly feuding&quot; with &quot;Ham&quot; Brooks. This began when his friend taught him some French words to say to an officer and Monk repeated them, not knowing they were a string of insults. The result was a lengthy stay in the guardhouse.
* Brigadier General Theodore Marley &quot;Ham&quot; Brooks, an accomplished attorney. Ham is considered one of the best-dressed men in the world, and as part of his attire, carries a sword cane whose blade is dipped in a fast-acting anesthetic. His nickname was acquired when Monk, in retaliation for his guardhouse incarceration, framed Brooks on a charge of stealing hams from the commissary. In the only case which Ham ever lost, he was convicted of stealing the hams.
* Colonel John &quot;Renny&quot; Renwick, a construction engineer. Renny is a giant of a man, with &quot;fists like buckets of gristle and bone.&quot; His favorite pastime is knocking the panels out of heavy wooden doors. He always wears a look of depression, which deepens the happier he grows. His favorite—and frequently used—expression, is &quot;Holy Cow!&quot;
* Major Thomas J. &quot;Long Tom&quot; Roberts, an electrical engineer. &quot;Long Tom&quot; got his nickname from using an antiquated cannon of that nickname in the successful defense of a French village in World War I. Long Tom was a sickly-looking character but fought like a wildcat.
* William Harper &quot;Johnny&quot; Littlejohn, an archaeologist and geologist. Johnny has an impressive vocabulary, never using a small word when a big one could suffice. (&quot;I&#x27;ll be superamalgamated!&quot; is a favorite expression.) Johnny wore eyeglasses with a magnifying lens over his left eye in early adventures—that eye having been damaged in World War I. Doc later performed corrective surgery that restored Johnny&#x27;s sight in that eye, but Johnny retained the magnifier as a monocle for use both as a magnifying glass and as a memento.

In later stories, Doc&#x27;s companions become less important to the plot as the stories focus more on Doc. The &quot;missing&quot; characters are explained as working elsewhere, too busy with their own accomplishments to help. Toward the end of the series, usually only Monk and Ham appear with Doc.

Doc&#x27;s cousin Patricia &quot;Pat&quot; Savage, who has Doc&#x27;s bronze skin, golden eyes, and bronze hair, also is along for many of the adventures, despite Doc&#x27;s best efforts to keep her away from danger. Pat chafes under these restrictions, or indeed any effort to protect her simply because she is female. She is also able to fluster Doc, even as she completely charms Monk and Ham.

===The 86th Floor===
Doc&#x27;s office is on the 86th floor of a New York City skyscraper, implicitly the Empire State Building, reached by Doc&#x27;s private high-speed elevator. Doc owns a fleet of cars, trucks, aircraft, and boats which he stores at a secret hangar on the Hudson River, under the name &quot;The Hidalgo Trading Company&quot;, which is linked to his office by a pneumatic-tube system nicknamed the &quot;flea run&quot;. He sometimes retreats to his Fortress of Solitude in the Arctic, which pre-dates Superman&#x27;s similar hideout of the same name. The entire operation is funded with gold from a Central American mine given to him by the local descendants of the Maya people in the first &quot;Doc Savage&quot; story. (Doc and his assistants learned the little-known Mayan language of this people at the same time, allowing them to communicate privately when others might be listening.)

===Technology===
Lester Dent kept current with the scientific developments of his era. While some of Doc&#x27;s gadgets were simply science fiction many of his &#x27;futuristic&#x27; devices were actual inventions, or ideas engineers were attempting to produce. Futuristic devices described in the series include the flying wing, the answering machine, television, automatic transmission, night vision goggles, electromagnetic rail guns, and a hand-held automatic weapon, known variously as the machine pistol, the supermachine pistol, or the rapid-firer. A wide range of ammunition types were used for the machine pistols, including incendiary bullets that smash on contact, coating the target with a high-temperature paste-fed fire, high explosive bullets able to uproot trees, ordinary lead bullets, and the sleep-inducing &quot;mercy bullets&quot;. Doc also developed an automated typewriter.

===Villains===
Doc&#x27;s greatest foe, and the only enemy to appear in two of the original pulp stories, was the Russian-born John Sunlight, introduced in October 1938 in the &quot;Fortress of Solitude&quot;. Early villains in the &quot;super-sagas&quot; were fantastic schemers bent on ruling the world. Later, the magazine was retitled &quot;Doc Savage, Science Detective&quot;, and Doc dealt with more conventional criminal organizations. The super-saga was revived in 1948 by new editor Daisy Bacon shortly before the final cancellation of the magazine. In a September 20, 1948, letter to Lester Dent, Bacon wrote &quot;As long as we are dropping the science detective and returning to just Doc Savage, I think we should return to a real adventure story...&quot;

A key characteristic of the Doc Savage stories is that the threats, no matter how fantastic, usually have a rational explanation. For example, a giant mountain-walking spider is revealed as a blimp, a scorching death comes from super-charged electric batteries, a &quot;sea angel&quot; is a mechanical construct towed by a submarine, Navy ships sunk by a mysterious force are actually sabotaged, and so on. But Doc Savage also battles invisible killers, a murderous teleporter, and superscientific foes from the center of the Earth.

In earlier stories, some of the criminals captured by Doc receive &quot;a delicate brain operation&quot; to cure their criminal tendencies. These criminals return to society, unaware of their past, to lead productive lives. The operation is mentioned in Truman Capote&#x27;s novel &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, as an older Kansan recalls Doc&#x27;s &quot;fixing&quot; of the criminals he had caught.

==Lester Dent==
Lester Dent, the series&#x27; principal author, had a mixed regard for his own creations. Though usually protective of his own work, he could be derisive of his pulp output. In interviews, he stated that he harbored no illusions of being a high-quality author of literature; for him, the Doc Savage series was simply a job, a way to earn a living by &quot;churning out reams and reams of sellable crap&quot;, never dreaming how his series would catch on. Comics historian Jim Steranko revealed that Dent used a formula to write his Doc Savage stories, so that his heroes were continually, and methodically, getting in and out of trouble. Dent was initially paid $500 per story and this was later increased to $750 during the Great Depression, enabling him to buy a yacht and vacation in the Caribbean.

==Bibliography==
===Novels===

All of the original stories were reprinted in paperback form by Bantam Books in the 1960s through 1990s. Of the first 67 paperback covers, 62 were painted in extraordinary monochromatic tones and super-realistic detail by James Bama, whose updated vision of Doc Savage with the exaggerated widow&#x27;s peak captured, at least symbolically, the essence of the Doc Savage novels. The first 96 paperbacks reprinted one of the original novels per book. Actor and model Steve Holland, who had played &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; in a 1953 television series, was the model for Doc on all the covers. The next 15 paperbacks (consisting of stories 97 through 126 in the Bantam reissue series) were &quot;doubles&quot;, reprinting two novels each (these were actually shorter novellas written during paper shortages of World War II). The last of the original novels were reprinted in a numbered series of 13 &quot;omnibus&quot; volumes of four to five stories each. It was one of the few pulp series to be completely reprinted in paperback form.

&quot;The Red Spider&quot; was a Doc Savage novel written by Dent in April 1948, about the Cold War with the Soviet Union. The story was killed in 1948 by new editor Daisy Bacon, though previous editor William de Grouchy had commissioned it. It was forgotten until 1975, when Doc Savage scholar Will Murray found hints of its existence in the Street &amp; Smith archives. After a two-year search, the carbon manuscript was located among Dent&#x27;s papers. It finally saw print in July 1979 as Number 95 in Bantam&#x27;s Doc Savage series.

When the original pulp stories were exhausted, Bantam Books hired Philip José Farmer to pen the tale of how Doc and his men met in World War I. &quot;Escape from Loki&quot; was published in 1991. It was followed by seven traditional Doc Savage stories written by novelist Will Murray, working from unpublished Lester Dent outlines, beginning with &quot;Python Isle.&quot; Philip José Farmer had earlier written the book &quot;Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life&quot; in 1973, which described the characters and the stories on the entertaining premise that Doc actually existed and the novels chronicled his exploits in &quot;fictionized&quot; form.

In 2011, Altus Press revived the series with another Murray-Dent posthumous collaboration, &quot;The Desert Demons.&quot; Nine new novels are planned for the new series &quot;The Wild Adventures of Doc Savage&quot;. In 2011, &quot;Doc Savage: Horror in Gold&quot; was published. In 2012, Altus Press published &quot;Doc Savage: Death&#x27;s Dark Domain&quot;, &quot;Doc Savage: The Forgotten Realm&quot;, &quot;Doc Savage: The Infernal Buddha&quot; and &quot;Doc Savage: The Desert Demons&quot;. &quot;Doc Savage: Skull Island&quot;, a crossover with King Kong, was released in 2013. Murray teamed Doc up with another Street &amp; Smith pulp-era hero, The Shadow, in Doc Savage: &quot;The Sinister Shadow&quot; (2015) and Doc Savage: &quot;Empire of Doom&quot; (2016).

Sanctum Books, in association with Nostalgia Ventures, began a new series of Doc reprints (starting November 2006), featuring two novels per book, in magazine-sized paperbacks. Several editions came with a choice of the original pulp cover or the covers from the Bantam paperbacks, and most include the original interior artwork, as well as new essays and reprints of other old material. In late 2008, Nostalgia Ventures ended their relationship, and Sanctum Books continues with the reprints on their own.

===Radio===

Two &quot;Doc Savage&quot; radio series were broadcast during the pulp era. The first, in 1934, was a 15-minute serial which ran for 26 episodes. The 1943 series was based not on the pulps, but on the comic book version of the character. No audio exists from either series, although some scripts survived. In 1985, National Public Radio aired &quot;The Adventures of Doc Savage&quot;, as 13 half-hour episodes, based on the pulps and adapted by Will Murray and Roger Rittner. Daniel Chodos starred as Doc.

=== Comic books ===

====Golden Age====

Street &amp; Smith Comics published comic book stories of Doc both in &quot;The Shadow&quot; comic and his own title. These started with &quot;Shadow Comics&quot; #1–3 (1940). In May 1940, the character moved to his own book, &quot;Doc Savage Comics&quot;. Originally, these stories were based on the pulp version, but with &quot;Doc Savage Comics&quot; #5 (1941), he was turned into a genuine superhero when he crashed in Tibet and was given a blue hood with a sacred ruby in the forehead that deflected bullets and hypnotized anyone who gazed into its mystical red light. These stories had a Doc (now known as &quot;The Invincible&quot;) who bore little resemblance to the character in the pulps. This lasted through the end of &quot;Doc Savage Comics&quot; in 1943 after 20 issues, and briefly with his return to &quot;Shadow Comics&quot; in vol. 3, #10 (Jan. 1944). He would last until the final issue, vol. 9, #5 (1948), though did not appear in every one. He also appeared in &quot;Supersnipe Comics&quot; #9 (June 1943).

====Modern Age====
Post-Golden Age, there have been several Doc Savage comic books:
* Gold Key Comics—A 1966, one-issue adaptation of &quot;The Thousand-Headed Man&quot; to tie into the planned movie starring Chuck Connors. Doc resembles Connors on the cover.
* Marvel Comics—In 1972, eight standard color comics with four adaptations of books—&quot;The Man of Bronze&quot;, &quot;Brand of the Werewolf&quot;, &quot;Death in Silver&quot;, and &quot;The Monsters&quot;—and one giant-size issue of reprints that was promoted as a movie issue. In May 2010, DC Comics reprinted the eight-issue series as a trade paperback. In 1975, the Marvel imprint Curtis Magazines released eight black-and-white magazines as a movie tie-in. These were also collected by DC Comics and reprinted in July 2011 as a trade paperback. All are original stories by Doug Moench, John Buscema, and Tony DeZuniga. The character also teamed up with the Thing in &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; #21, an important issue that would form the basis of later significant stories like &quot;The Project Pegasus Saga&quot; and &quot;Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe&quot;, and Spider-Man in &quot;Giant-Size Spider-Man&quot; #3.
* DC Comics—A 1987–1990 four-issue miniseries tryout, then 24 issues and one &quot;Annual&quot;, mostly written by Mike W. Barr. Original adventures, including a reunion with Doc&#x27;s Mayan sweetheart/wife Monya and John Sunlight, adventures with Doc&#x27;s grandson &quot;Chip&quot; Savage, and backstory on Doc&#x27;s parents and youth. Included a four-issue crossover with DC&#x27;s then-current run of &quot;The Shadow&quot; called &quot;The Shadow Strikes!&quot;. In 2009, DC would publish a special one-shot Doc Savage crossover with Batman written by Brian Azzarello with art by Phil Noto and a cover by J. G. Jones. Other characters involved included the Black Canary, the Avenger, Rima the Jungle Girl, the Spirit, and Doc Savage&#x27;s group the Fabulous Five. It is a prologue to &quot;First Wave&quot;, a six-issue miniseries with art by Rags Morales. The First Wave line was then expanded to include a &quot;Doc Savage&quot; ongoing series written by Paul Malmont, with art by Howard Porter. Malmont only wrote the first four issues, with other authors writing the rest of the series. It ran for 18 issues, with the final issue released only in digital format.
* Millennium Publications published several miniseries and one-shots, including &quot;Doc Savage: The Monarch of Armageddon&quot;, a four-part miniseries, from 1991 to 1992. Written by Mark Ellis and penciled by Darryl Banks, the treatment &quot;come[s] closest to the original, capturing all the action, humanity, and humor of the original novels&quot;. Other miniseries were &quot;Doom Dynasty&quot; and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Thoughts&quot;, the one-shots &quot;Pat Savage: Woman of Bronze&quot; and &quot;Manual of Bronze&quot;, and an unfinished two-part adaptation of &quot;Repel&quot;.
* Dark Horse Comics—In 1995, Dark Horse Comics published two miniseries: a two-issue miniseries &quot;The Shadow and Doc Savage: The Case of the Shrieking Skeletons&quot; and four-issue miniseries &quot;Doc Savage: Curse of the Fire God&quot;.
*In December 2013, Dynamite Entertainment began publishing the title &quot;Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze&quot;, written by Chris Roberson, with art by Bilquis Evely and covers by Alex Ross.

===Film===
With the Bantam Books reprints a success, media tie-ins for Doc Savage began immediately. A 1965 house ad for a poster, &quot;The Arch-Enemy of Evil&quot;, announces, &quot;Tougher than Tarzan, braver than Bond, Doc is America&#x27;s newest rage - with teenagers, college students, and the &#x27;in&#x27; groups all over the country. And there&#x27;s a television series and feature motion picture in the future.&quot;

====&quot;The Thousand-Headed Man&quot;====
In 1967, a &quot;TV Guide&quot; article reported talks were underway to have Chuck Connors play Doc Savage in a movie adaptation of &quot;The Thousand-Headed Man&quot;. Complications with rights killed the project.

====&quot;Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze&quot;====

In 1975, producer and director George Pal produced the movie &quot;Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze&quot;, starring Ron Ely as Doc Savage. The movie was a critical failure and did poorly at the box office. Several articles and a later interview with Pal suggest the movie&#x27;s failure had much to do with its loss of funding during filming when the studio changed heads and Pal was forced to cut costs. Nevertheless, Pal, as producer, is generally blamed for using the &quot;high camp&quot; approach in the style of the &quot;Batman&quot; television series. An original soundtrack for the film was also commissioned, but when Pal lost his funding, he resorted to a patriotic march from John Philip Sousa, which was in the public domain. Science-fiction writer Philip José Farmer tried to get another movie made (there is a notation at the end of the original film that a sequel adapted from the novel &quot;Death in Silver&quot; featuring the infamous Silver Death&#x27;s-Heads was in the works, but nothing came of it, despite the drafting of a script for it).

====&quot;Doc Savage: The Arch Enemy of Evil&quot;====
According to the screenplay by Joe Morhaim that was posted on the Internet, as well as other archival and news accounts, &quot;Doc Savage: The Arch Enemy of Evil&quot; was based very loosely on the October 1934 pulp novel &quot;Death in Silver&quot;. &quot;Doc Savage: The Arch Enemy of Evil&quot; would feature a deformed, German-speaking supervillain, whose pet man-eating octopus was a nod to a similar plot element in the September 1937 pulp novel &quot;The Feathered Octopus&quot;.

In fact, this screenplay was originally intended to be filmed as the first Doc Savage movie. However, producer George Pal commissioned a second script based on the first Doc Savage pulp novel, &quot;The Man of Bronze&quot;, because he felt the movie-going audience needed more background information about Doc and his origin.

Contemporary news accounts indicated that &quot;Doc Savage: The Arch Enemy of Evil&quot; had been filmed in the Lake Tahoe area simultaneously with the principal photography for the first Doc Savage film. However, due to the poor reception of the first film, &quot;Doc Savage: The Arch Enemy of Evil&quot; was never completed or released. In an interview conducted in 2014, while he was filming the television movie &quot;Expecting Amish&quot;, actor Ron Ely stated unequivocally that &quot;no portion of &quot;The Arch Enemy of Evil&quot; was &quot;ever&quot; filmed, concurrently with &quot;The Man of Bronze&quot; or otherwise. That&#x27;s a total myth.&quot;

Finally, in anticipation of a proposed &quot;Doc Savage&quot; TV series, George Pal commissioned a two-part teleplay by Alvin Sapinsley based on the May 1935 pulp novel &quot;The Secret in the Sky&quot;. The teleplay was completed in January 1975, but due to the poor reception of the first Doc Savage film, a pilot was never filmed.

====Other film adaptations====
Another screenplay was written by Philip José Farmer based on the January 1936 pulp novel &quot;Murder Mirage&quot;. It included a potential Wold Newton Universe cross-over involving a meeting between Doc Savage and a retired Sherlock Holmes in 1936. In any case, this screenplay was never filmed. In 1966, the basic premise of Doc Savage&#x27;s origin was an obvious influence on the Mexican lucha libre film character &quot;Mil Mascaras&quot; (1966), which was released at the height of the popularity of the Doc Savage paperback book series in the U.S.

In 1999, there was an announcement that a possible remake featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger was in the works, with the involvement of Frank Darabont and Chuck Russell, but it and several other Schwarzenegger projects (&quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; and an epic about the Crusades) were shelved when Schwarzenegger ran for and was elected Governor of California.

In late 2006, Sam Raimi was rumoured to be making a film involving several Street and Smith pulp heroes, including The Shadow, The Avenger, and Doc Savage. A screenplay was supposedly written by Siavash Farahani but since then, no other news surfaced with regards to this script.

====&quot;Original Film&quot; projects====
Writer/director Shane Black was set to direct a film adaptation for Original Film and Sony Pictures. Black would also co-write the screenplay with Anthony Bagarozzi and Chuck Mondry. The film version will be set in the 1930s and will include the Fabulous Five. Neal H. Moritz will produce. In September 2013, talking about the difficulty in casting the character, Black commented, &quot;He&#x27;s the perfect physical specimen, people look at him and they are over-awed by the symmetry and perfection he exudes.&quot; In June 2014, it was revealed that he wanted Chris Hemsworth for the lead role but Hemsworth was never officially announced or attached to the project.

On May 22, 2016, Black told Thrillist that he would like to make the movie with Dwayne Johnson, stating, &quot;I made a decision that Dwayne is the guy. I would like to do Doc with Dwayne Johnson if we can make that work. It&#x27;s on the back burner while he&#x27;s busy.&quot; On May 30, 2016, Johnson confirmed on his Instagram account that he will be starring as Savage in the film, also hinting that the character is being dubbed the &quot;World&#x27;s First Superhero&quot;, mentioning that Savage&#x27;s published appearance pre-dated that of Superman&#x27;s (who debuted in 1938). Johnson also included the hashtag &quot;#World&#x27;sFirstSuperhero&quot;. On April 11, 2018, Johnson said he and Black were still eager to do the project, but, &quot;That project had a few issues, not creative issues but more so business affairs issues—where the project once was, who had rights to it, where we were trying to move it to. There was a lot of that, which we&#x27;re still kind of working through.&quot;

On February 19, 2020, it was announced Original Film would, instead, shift development to a television series. The project is a co-production with Sony Pictures Television and Condé Nast Entertainment.

<text>Bharat Mata (, Mother India in English) is a national personification of India (Bharat) as a mother goddess. Bharat Mata is commonly depicted dressed in a red or saffron-coloured sari and holding a national flag; she sometimes stands on a lotus and is accompanied by a lion. 

The word &quot;Bharat Mata&quot; dates to late 19th century Bengal in modern literature. She was popularised by the Bengali language-novel &quot;Anandamath&quot; (1882), wherein she was depicted in a form inseparable from the Hindu goddesses Durga and Kali. After the controversial division of Bengal province in 1905, she was highlighted during the boycott of British-made goods organized by Sir Surendranath Bannerjee. In numerous protest meetings, she was invoked in the rallying cry &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; (I bow to the mother). 

Bharat Mata was painted as a four-armed goddess by Abanindranath Tagore in 1904, in the style associated with the Bengal School of Art, in a form derived from typical depictions of Hindu goddesses. This painting is displayed in the Victoria Memorial Museum in Kolkata. By the late 19th century, maps of India produced by the British Raj, and based on the Great Trigonometrical Survey, had become widely available. Over the background of a map, Bharat Mata was depicted on the cover of the poet Subramania Bharati&#x27;s Tamil language-magazine &quot;Vijaya&quot; in 1909. In the decades following, she appeared throughout India in popular art: in magazines, posters, and calendars, becoming a symbol of Indian nationalism. 

There are a handful of Bharat Mata temples in India. The first was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi in Varanasi in 1936. The temple has a large marble relief map of India on its floor, but originally lacked a murti (divine image used for worship). On its wall is displayed a poem written for the inauguration by the nationalist Hindi language-poet Maithili Sharan Gupt; it proclaims the temple to be open to all castes and religions. Most visitors to the temple are foreign tourists. Indian Muslims and Sikhs have opposed the chanting of her name, because in Islam and Sikhism, God cannot be worshipped in human form.

==History==

The image of Bharat Mata formed with the Indian independence movement of the late 19th century. A play by Kiran Chandra Banerjee, &quot;Bharat Mata&quot;, was first performed in 1873. The play, set during the 1770 Bengal famine, depicts a woman and her husband who go to the forest and encounter rebels. A priest takes them to a temple where they are shown Bharat Mata. Thus they are inspired and lead a rebellion which results in the defeat of the British. The &quot;Manushi&quot; magazine story traces origin to a satirical work &quot;Unabimsa Purana&quot; or &quot;The Nineteenth Purana&quot; by Bhudeb Mukhopadhyay which was first published anonymously in 1866. Bankim Chandra Chatterjee in 1882 wrote a novel &quot;Anandamath&quot; and introduced the hymn &quot;Vande Mātaram&quot;, which soon became the song of the emerging freedom movement in India. As the British Raj created cartographic shape of India through the Geological Survey of India, the Indian nationalist developed it into an icon of nationalism. 

In the 1920s, it became a more political image, sometimes including images of Mahatma Gandhi and Bhagat Singh. The Tiranga flag was also started being included during this period. In 1930s, the image entered in religious practice. The Bharat Mata temple was built in Varanasi in 1936 by Shiv Prashad Gupt and was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi. This temple does not have any statuary but only a marble relief of the map of India. Bipin Chandra Pal elaborated its meaning in idealizing and idealist terms, along with Hindu philosophical traditions and devotional practices. It represented an archaic spiritual essence, a transcendental idea of Universe as well as expressing Universal Hinduism and nationhood.

Abanindranath Tagore portrayed Bharat Mata as a four-armed Hindu goddess wearing saffron-colored robes, holding the manuscripts, sheaves of rice, a mala, and a white cloth. The image of Bharatmata was an icon to create nationalist feeling in Indians during the freedom struggle. Sister Nivedita, an admirer of the painting, opined that the picture was refined and imaginative, with Bharatmata standing on green earth and blue sky behind her; feet with four lotuses, four arms meaning divine power; white halo and sincere eyes; and gifts Shiksha-Diksha-Anna-Bastra of the motherland to her children.
Indian Independence activist Subramania Bharati saw Bharat Mata as the land of Ganga. He identified Bharat Mata as Mahadevi. He also says that he has got the Darśana of Bharat Mata during his visit with his guru Sister Nivedita.

==Significance==
In the book &quot;Everyday Nationalism: Women of the Hindu Right in India&quot;, Kalyani Devaki Menon argues that &quot;the vision of India as Bharat Mata has profound implications for the politics of Hindu nationalism&quot; and that the depiction of India as a Hindu goddess implies that it is not just the patriotic but also the religious duty of all Hindus to participate in the nationalist struggle to defend the nation. This association has caused controversy with devout Muslims, whose belief in the oneness of God keeps them from assigning divinity to any god other than Allah.

The motto &quot;Bharat Mata ki Jai&quot; (&quot;Victory for Mother India&quot;) is used by the Indian Army. In contemporary colloquial usage, however, the expression is analogous to &quot;Long live Mother India&quot; or &quot;Salute to Mother India.&quot; (See also Jai Hind.) Muslim-majority Indonesia&#x27;s several dozen national armed units also use Hindu-origin Sanskrit language mottoes, including the National Armed Forces, Army, Navy, for example the Indonesian Air Force&#x27;s motto &quot;Swabhuana Paksa&quot; (&quot;Wings of The Motherland&quot;) and the Indonesian National Police&#x27;s motto &quot;Rastra Sewakottama&quot; (&quot;Nation&#x27;s Best Servants&quot;).

==Temples==

===Varanasi===
The Bharat Mata Temple is located in the Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapeeth campus in Varanasi. The temple houses a marble idol of Bharat Mata along with a marble relief map of India.

The Temple, a gift from the nationalists Shiv Prasad Gupta and Durga Prasad Khatri, was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi in 1936. Mahatma Gandhi said, &quot;I hope this temple, which will serve as a cosmopolitan platform for people of all religions, castes, and creeds including Harijans, will go a great way in promoting religious unity, peace, and love in the country.&quot;

===Haridwar===
The temple was founded by Swami Satyamitranand on the banks of the Ganges in Haridwar. It has 8 storeys and is 180 feet tall. It was inaugurated by Indira Gandhi in 1983. Floors are dedicated to mythological legends, religious deities, freedom fighters and leaders.

=== Kolkata ===
The temple is located in Michael Nagar on Jessore Road, barely 2 km away from the Kolkata Airport. Here, Bharat Mata is portrayed through the image of &quot;Jagattarini Durga&quot;. This was inaugurated on October 19, 2015 (Mahashashti Day of Durga Puja that year) by Keshari Nath Tripathi, the Governor of West Bengal. The initiative to build the temple, which has been named &quot;Jatiya Shaktipeeth&quot;, was taken by the &quot;Spiritual Society of India&quot; in order to mark the 140th anniversary of &quot;Vande Mataram&quot;.

===Kurukshetra ===
In July 2019, the Chief Minister of Haryana, Manohar Lal Khattar, granted 5 acre land near Mahabharta-era Jyotisar tirth to the &quot;Bharat Mata Trust&quot; of &quot;Juna Akhara&quot; to construct the next temple of Bharat Mata.

<text>Eldar is a masculine given name and surname of various origins.

In Scandinavian countries, the name means &quot;fire warrior,&quot; derived from the North Germanic languages.

The name is also popular in the former countries of the Soviet Union, especially among the Turkic population, where it is understood to mean &quot;country/society possessor&quot; or &quot;ruler.&quot;

In the Balkans, Eldar is popular among Bosniaks in the former Yugoslav nations and is also used among Albanians. Its popularity among these groups may be influenced by other similar popular names, such as Elvir, Elvin, and Elmir.

In Hebrew, the name means &quot;God resides,&quot; and it is used as a surname among Jews in Israel.

<doc id="100580" wikidata="Q79941" url="?curid=100580" title="Selma, Alabama">
<text>Selma is a city in and the county seat of Dallas County, in the Black Belt region of south central Alabama and extending to the west. Located on the banks of the Alabama River, the city has a population of 17,971 as of the 2020 census. About 80% of the population is African-American.

Selma was a trading center and market town during the antebellum years of King Cotton in the South. It was also an important armaments-manufacturing and iron shipbuilding center for the Confederacy during the Civil War, surrounded by miles of earthen fortifications. The Confederate forces were defeated during the Battle of Selma, in the final full month of the war.

In modern times, the city is best known for the 1960s civil rights movement and the Selma to Montgomery marches, beginning with &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; in March 1965, when unarmed peaceful protesters were assaulted by County and state highway police.

By the end of March 1965, an estimated 25,000 people entered Montgomery to press for voting rights. This activism generated national attention for social justice. That summer, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed by Congress to authorize federal oversight and enforcement of constitutional rights of all American citizens.

Due to agriculture and industry decline, Selma has lost about a third of its peak population since the 1960s. The city is focusing on heritage tourism, to build on its role as a major influence in civil rights and desegregation.

Selma is one of Alabama&#x27;s poorest cities, with an average income of $35,500, which is 30% less than the state average. One in every three residents in Selma lives below the state poverty line.

==History==
Before discovery and settlement, the area of present-day Selma had been inhabited for thousands of years by various warring tribes of Native Americans. The Europeans encountered the historic Native American people known as the Muscogee (also known as the Creek), who had been in the area for hundreds of years.

French explorers and colonists were the first Europeans to explore this area. In 1732, they recorded the site of present-day Selma as &quot;Écor Bienville.&quot; Later Anglo-Americans called it the Moore&#x27;s Bluff settlement. Selma was incorporated in 1820. The city was planned and named as Selma by William R. King, a politician and planter from North Carolina who was a future vice president of the United States. The name, meaning &#x27;high seat&#x27; or &#x27;throne&#x27;, came from the Ossianic poem &quot;The Songs of Selma&quot;.

===Selma during the Civil War===
During the Civil War, Selma was one of the South&#x27;s main military manufacturing centers, producing many supplies and munitions, and building Confederate warships such as the ironclad &quot;Tennessee&quot;. The Selma iron works and foundry, where a young William Kehoe made bullets, was considered the second-most important source of weaponry for the South, after the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, Virginia. Half the cannon and two thirds of the fixed ammunition used by the Confederacy in the last two years of the war were made there. This strategic concentration of manufacturing capabilities eventually made Selma a target of Union raids into Alabama late in the Civil War.

Because of its military importance, Selma had been fortified by three miles of earthworks that ran in a semicircle around the city. They were anchored on the north and south by the Alabama River. The works had been built two years earlier, and while neglected for the most part since, were still formidable. They were high, thick at the base, with a ditch wide and deep along the front. In front of this was a -high picket fence of heavy posts planted in the ground and sharpened at the top. At prominent positions, earthen forts were built with artillery in position to cover the ground over which an assault would have to be made.
The North had learned of the importance of Selma to the Confederate military, and the US military planned to take the city. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman first made an effort to reach it, but after advancing from the west as far as Meridian, Mississippi, within of Selma, his forces retreated back to the Mississippi River. Gen. Benjamin Grierson, invading with a cavalry force from Memphis, Tennessee, was intercepted and returned. Gen. Rousseau made a dash in the direction of Selma, but was misled by his guides and struck the railroad forty miles east of Montgomery. 

====Battle of Selma====
On March 30, 1865, Union General James H. Wilson detached Gen. John T. Croxton&#x27;s brigade to destroy all Confederate property at Tuscaloosa. Wilson&#x27;s forces captured a Confederate courier, who was found to be carrying dispatches from Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest describing his scattered forces. Wilson sent a brigade to destroy the bridge across the Cahaba River at Centreville, which cut off most of Forrest&#x27;s reinforcements from reaching the area. He began a running fight with Forrest&#x27;s forces that did not end until after the fall of Selma.

On the afternoon of April 1, opening what would be the final full month of the war, and after skirmishing all morning, Wilson&#x27;s advanced guard ran into Forrest&#x27;s line of battle at Ebenezer Church, where the Randolph Road intersected the main Selma road. Forrest had hoped to bring his entire force to bear on Wilson. Delays caused by flooding, plus earlier contact with the enemy, resulted in Forrest&#x27;s mustering fewer than 2,000 men, many of whom were not war veterans but home militia consisting of old men and young boys.

The outnumbered and outgunned Confederates fought for more than an hour as reinforcements of Union cavalry and artillery were deployed. Forrest was wounded by a saber-wielding Union captain, whom he shot and killed with his revolver. Finally, a Union cavalry charge broke the Confederate militia, causing Forrest to be flanked on his right. He was forced to retreat.
Early the next morning, Forrest reached Selma; he advised Gen. Richard Taylor, departmental commander, to leave the city. Taylor did so after giving Forrest command of the defense. Selma was protected by fortifications that circled much of the city; it was protected on the north and south by the Alabama River. The wall was high and deep, surrounded by a ditch and picket fence. Earthen forts were built to cover the grounds with artillery fire.

Forrest&#x27;s defenders consisted of his Tennessee escort company, McCullough&#x27;s Missouri Regiment, Crossland&#x27;s Kentucky Brigade, Roddey&#x27;s Alabama Brigade, Frank Armstrong&#x27;s Mississippi Brigade, General Daniel W. Adams&#x27; state reserves, and the citizens of Selma who were &quot;volunteered&quot; to man the works. Altogether this force numbered less than 4,000. As the Selma fortifications were built to be defended by 20,000 men, Forrest&#x27;s soldiers had to stand 10 to apart to try to cover the works.

Wilson&#x27;s force arrived in front of the Selma fortifications at 2 pm. He had placed Gen. Eli Long&#x27;s Division across the Summerfield Road with the Chicago Board of Trade Battery in support. Gen. Emory Upton&#x27;s Division was placed across the Range Line Road with Battery I, 4th US Artillery in support. Altogether Wilson had 9,000 troops available for the assault.

The Federal commander&#x27;s plan was for Upton to send in a 300-man detachment after dark to cross the swamp on the Confederate right; enter the works, and begin a flanking movement toward the center moving along the line of fortifications. A single gun from Upton&#x27;s artillery would signal the attack to be undertaken by the entire Federal Corps.

At 5 pm, however, Gen. Eli Long&#x27;s ammunition train in the rear was attacked by advance elements of Forrest&#x27;s scattered forces approaching Selma. Both Long and Upton had positioned significant numbers of troops in their rear for just such an event. But, Long decided to begin his assault against the Selma fortifications to neutralize the enemy attack in his rear.

Long&#x27;s troops attacked in a single rank in three main lines, dismounted and shooting their Spencer&#x27;s carbines, supported by their own artillery fire. The Confederates replied with heavy small arms and artillery fire. The Southern artillery had only solid shot on hand, while a short distance away was an arsenal which produced tons of canister, a highly effective anti-personnel ammunition.
The Federals suffered many casualties (including General Long) but continued their attack. Once the Union Army reached the works, there was vicious hand-to-hand fighting. Many soldiers were struck down with clubbed muskets, but they kept pouring into the works with their greater numbers. In less than 30 minutes, Long&#x27;s men had captured the works protecting the Summerfield Road.

Meanwhile, General Upton, observing Long&#x27;s success, ordered his division forward. They succeeded in overmounting the defenses and soon U.S. flags could be seen waving over the works from Range Line Road to Summerfield Road.

After the outer works fell, General Wilson led the 4th U.S. Cavalry Regiment in a mounted charge down the Range Line Road toward the unfinished inner line of works. The retreating Confederate forces, upon reaching the inner works, united and fired repeatedly together into the charging column. This broke up the charge and sent General Wilson sprawling to the ground when his favorite horse was wounded. He quickly remounted his stricken horse and ordered a dismounted assault by several regiments.

Mixed units of Confederate troops had also occupied the Selma railroad depot and the adjoining banks of the railroad bed to make a stand next to the Plantersville Road (present day Broad Street). The fighting there was heavy, but by 7 p.m. the superior numbers of Union troops had managed to flank the Southern positions. The Confederates abandoned the depot as well as the inner line of works.

In the darkness, the Federals rounded up hundreds of prisoners, but hundreds more escaped down the Burnsville Road, including generals Forrest, Armstrong, and Roddey. To the west, many Confederate soldiers fought the pursuing Union Army all the way down to the eastern side of Valley Creek. They escaped in the darkness by swimming across the Alabama River near the mouth of Valley Creek (where the present day Battle of Selma Reenactment is held.)

The Union troops looted the city that night and burned many businesses and private residences. They spent the next week destroying the arsenal and naval foundry. They left Selma heading to Montgomery. When the war ended three weeks later, they were en route to Columbus and Macon, Georgia.

===Post-war period===
Selma became the seat of Dallas County in 1866 and the county courthouse was built there. Planters and other slaveholders struggled with how to deal with freed slaves after the war. Insurgents tried to keep white supremacy over the freedmen, and most whites resented former slaves being granted the right to vote. As in other southern states, white Democrats regained political power in the mid-1870s after suppressing black voting through violence and fraud; Reconstruction officially ended in 1877 when federal troops were withdrawn. The white Democratic state legislature imposed Jim Crow laws of racial segregation in public facilities and other means of white supremacy.

The city developed its own police force. County law enforcement was run by an elected county sheriff, whose jurisdiction included the grounds of the county courthouse. The county courthouse and jail were scenes of numerous lynchings of African-Americans, as sometimes mobs would take prisoners from the jail and hang them before trial. In February 1892, Willy Webb was put in the jail in Selma after police arrested him in Waynesville. The police intended to save Webb from a local lynch mob, but the mob abducted Webb from the jail and killed him. In June 1893, a lynch mob numbering 100 men seized &quot;a black man named Daniel Edwards from the Selma jail, hanged him from a tree, and fired multiple rounds into his body&quot; for allegedly becoming intimate with a white woman. In the 20th century, African-Americans were also lynched for labor-organizing activities. In 1935, Joe Spinner Johnson, a leader of the Alabama Sharecroppers Union, which worked from 1931 to 1936 to get better pay and treatment from white planters, was beaten by a mob near his field, taken to the jail in Selma and beaten more; his body was left in a field near Greensboro.

===Twentieth century===
In 1901, the state legislature passed a new constitution with electoral provisions, such as poll taxes and literacy tests, that effectively disenfranchised most blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites, leaving them without representation in government, and deprived them of participation in juries and other forms of citizenship. Selma, Dallas County and other jurisdictions carried out the segregation laws passed by the state.

Especially in the post-World War II period, legal challenges by the NAACP against Southern discriminatory laws enabled blacks to more freely exercise their constitutional rights as citizens.

====Selma Voting Rights Movement====

Selma maintained segregated schools and other facilities, enforcing the state law in new enterprises such as movie theaters. The Jim Crow laws and customs were enforced with violence.
In the 1960s, black people who pushed the boundaries, attempting to eat at &quot;white-only&quot; lunch counters or sit in the downstairs &quot;white&quot; section of movie theaters, were still beaten and arrested. Nearly half of Selma&#x27;s residents were black, but because of the restrictive electoral laws and practices in place since the turn of the century, only one percent were registered to vote, preventing them from serving on juries or serving in local office. All the members of the city council were elected by at-large voting. Black people were prevented from registering to vote by means of a literacy test, administered in a subjective way, as well as through economic retaliation organized by the White Citizens&#x27; Council in response to civil rights activism, Ku Klux Klan violence and police repression. After the Supreme Court case &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; (1944) ended the use of white primaries by the Democratic Party, the Alabama state legislature passed a law giving voting registrars more authority to challenge prospective voters under the literacy test. In Selma, the county registration board opened doors for registration only two days a month, arrived late and took long lunches.

In early 1963, Bernard Lafayette and Colia Lafayette of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) began organizing in Selma alongside local civil rights leaders Sam, Amelia and Bruce Boynton, Rev. L.L. Anderson of Tabernacle Baptist Church, J.L. Chestnut (Selma&#x27;s first black attorney), SCLC Citizenship School teacher Marie Foster, public school teacher Marie Moore, Frederick D. Reese and others active with the Dallas County Voters League (DCVL).

In 1963, under the leadership of Patricia Swift Blalock, the public library of Selma-Dallas County was integrated.
Against fierce opposition from Dallas County Sheriff Jim Clark and his volunteer posse, black people continued their voter registration and desegregation efforts, which expanded during 1963 and the first part of 1964. Defying intimidation, economic retaliation, arrests, firings and beatings, an ever-increasing number of Dallas County blacks tried to register to vote, but few were able to do so under the subjective system administered by whites.

In the summer of 1964, a sweeping injunction issued by local judge James Hare barred any gathering of three or more people under sponsorship of SNCC, SCLC or DCVL, or with the involvement of 41 named civil rights leaders. This injunction temporarily halted civil-rights activity until Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. defied it by speaking to a crowd about the struggle at Brown Chapel AME Church on January 2, 1965. He had been invited by local leaders to help their movement.

Beginning in January 1965, SCLC and SNCC initiated a revived voting-rights campaign designed to focus national attention on the systematic denial of black voting rights in Alabama, and particularly in Selma. Over the next weeks, more than 3,000 African-Americans were arrested, and they suffered police violence and economic retaliation. Jimmie Lee Jackson, who was unarmed, was killed in a café in nearby Marion after state police broke up a peaceful protest in the town.


Activists planned a larger, more public march from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery to publicize their cause. It was initiated and organized by James Bevel, SCLC&#x27;s Director of Direct Action, who was directing SCLC&#x27;s Selma Movement. This march represented one of the political and emotional peaks of the modern civil-rights movement. On March 7, 1965, approximately 600 civil rights marchers departed Selma on U.S. Highway 80, heading east to the capital. After they passed over the crest of the Edmund Pettus Bridge and left the boundaries of the city, they were confronted by county sheriff&#x27;s deputies and state troopers, who attacked them using tear gas, horses and billy clubs, and drove them back across the bridge. Governor George Wallace had vowed that the march would not be permitted. Seventeen marchers were hospitalized and 50 more were treated for lesser injuries. Because of the brutal attacks, this became known as &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;. It was covered by national press and television news, reaching many American and international homes.

Two days after the first march, on March 9, 1965, Martin Luther King, Jr. led a symbolic march over the bridge. By then local activists and residents had been joined by hundreds of protesters from across the country, including numerous clergy and nuns. White people made up one-third of the marchers. King pulled the marchers back from entering the county and having another confrontation with county and state forces. But that night, white minister James Reeb, who had traveled to the city from Boston, was attacked and killed in Selma by members of the KKK.

King and other civil-rights leaders filed for court protection for a third, larger-scale march from Selma to Montgomery, the state capital. King was also in touch with the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who arranged for protection for another march. Frank Minis Johnson, Jr., the federal district court judge for the area who reviewed the injunction, decided in favor of the demonstrators, saying:


On Sunday, March 21, 1965, approximately 3,200 marchers departed for Montgomery. Marching in the front row with King were Rev. Ralph Abernathy, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, Greek Orthodox Father Iakovos (later Archbishop Iakovos of America) and Roman Catholic nuns. They walked approximately 12 miles a day and slept in nearby fields. The federal government provided protection in the form of National Guard and military troops. Thousands joined the march along the way. By the time the marchers reached the capital four days later, on March 25, their strength had swelled to around 25,000 people. Their moral campaign had attracted thousands from across the country.

The events at Selma helped increase public support for the cause; later that year the U.S. Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a bill introduced, supported and signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson. It provided for federal oversight and enforcement of voting rights for all citizens in state or jurisdictions where patterns of underrepresentation showed discrimination against certain populations such as ethnic minorities.

By March 1966, a year after the Selma-to-Montgomery marches, nearly 11,000 black people had registered to vote in Selma, where 12,000 white people were registered. Registration increased by November, when Wilson Baker was elected as Dallas County Sheriff to replace the notorious Jim Clark.

However, seven years later, black people had not been able to elect a candidate of their choice to the city council. The council&#x27;s members were elected at-large by the entire city, and the white majority had managed to control the elections. Threatened with a lawsuit under the Voting Rights Act, the council voted to adopt a system of electing its ten members from single-member districts. After the change, five African-American Democrats were elected to the city council, including activist Frederick Douglas Reese, who became a major power in the city; five white people were also elected to the council.

The complex history is reflected in naming and monuments as well. Highway 80, which runs east and west through Selma and the state has reflected this in naming patterns. In 1920 the east-west Highway 80 was designated as part of the Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway. In 1977 US 80 was named Givhan Parkway in honor of the long-serving state senator Walter C. Givhan, a segregationist to the end. In 1996 it was designated as part of the &#x27;National Civil Rights Trail&#x27; by President Bill Clinton and is administered by the National Park Service. In 2000 sections of Highway 80 leading into Selma were renamed in honor of leaders in the Selma Voting Rights Movement: F.D. Reese, Marie Foster, and Amelia Boynton.

As part of its Civil War history, a monument to native Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate General, was installed in Old Live Oak Cemetery. It was torn down in 2012, reflecting the continuing controversy about him. In August 2012, plans were announced to build a larger monument, more resistant to vandalism, but many African Americans object to it because of his established history as a postwar leader with the KKK and his earlier involvement in the massacre of black Union troops at Fort Pillow.

<text>Orlando ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Orange County, Florida, United States. The city proper had a population of 307,573 at the 2020 census, making it the fourth-most populous city in Florida behind Jacksonville, Miami, and Tampa and the state&#x27;s most populous inland city. Part of Central Florida, it is the center of the Orlando metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.67 million in 2020. It is the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the Southern United States and the third-largest metropolitan area in Florida behind Miami and Tampa Bay. 

Orlando is one of the most-visited cities in the world primarily due to tourism, major events, and convention traffic. It is the fourth-most visited city in the U.S. after New York City, Miami, and Los Angeles, with over 3.5 million visitors as of 2023. Orlando International Airport is the 7th-busiest airport in the United States and the 18th-busiest in the world. The two largest and most internationally renowned tourist attractions in the Orlando area are the Walt Disney World resort, opened by the Walt Disney Company in 1971 and located about southwest of downtown Orlando in Bay Lake, and the Universal Orlando resort, opened in 1990 as a major expansion of Universal Studios Florida and the only theme park inside Orlando city limits.

With the exception of the theme parks, most major cultural sites like the Orlando Museum of Art and Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts and nightlife, bars and clubs are located in downtown Orlando. Other attractions like Orlando Eye at ICON Park are located along International Drive. The city is also one of the busiest American cities for conferences and conventions; Orange County Convention Center is the second-largest convention facility in the United States.

Like other major cities in the Sun Belt, Orlando grew rapidly from the 1960s into the first decade of the 21st century. Orlando is home to the University of Central Florida, which became the largest university campus in the United States in terms of enrollment as of 2015. In 2010, Orlando was listed as a &quot;Gamma+&quot; level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.

==Etymology==
Fort Gatlin, as the Orlando area was once known, was established at what is now just south of the city limits by the 4th U.S. Artillery under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander C. W. Fanning on November 9, 1838, during the construction of a series of fortified encampments across Florida during the Second Seminole War. The fort and surrounding area were named for John S. Gatlin, an Army physician who was killed in Dade&#x27;s Massacre on December 28, 1835. The site of construction for Fort Gatlin, a defensible position with fresh water between three small lakes, was likely chosen because the location was on a main trail and is less than 250 yards from a nearby Council Oak tree, where Native Americans had traditionally met. King Phillip and Coacoochee frequented this area and the tree was alleged to be the place where the previous 1835 ambush that had killed over 100 soldiers had been planned. When the U.S. military abandoned the fort in 1839, the surrounding community was built up by settlers.

Prior to being known by its current name, Orlando was once known as Jernigan. This name originates from the first European permanent settlers, Isaac and Aaron Jernigan, cattlemen who moved from the state of Georgia and acquired land northwest of Fort Gatlin along the west end of Lake Holden in July 1843 by the terms of the Armed Occupation Act. Aaron Jernigan became Orange County&#x27;s first state representative in 1845, but his pleas for additional military protection went unanswered.

Fort Gatlin was briefly reoccupied by the military for a few weeks during October and November 1849, and subsequently a volunteer militia was left to defend the settlement. A historical marker indicates that by 1850, the Jernigan homestead (or Fort Gatlin in some sources) served as the nucleus of a village named Jernigan. According to an account written years later by his daughter, at that time, about 80 settlers were forced to shelter for about a year in &quot;a stockade that Aaron Jernigan built on the north side of Lake Conway&quot;. One of the county&#x27;s first records, a grand jury&#x27;s report, mentions a stockade where it states homesteaders were &quot;driven from their homes and forced to huddle together in hasty defences [sic].&quot; Aaron Jernigan led a local volunteer militia during 1852.

A post office opened at Jernigan in 1850. Jernigan appears on an 1855 map of Florida, and by 1856, the area had become the county seat of Orange County. In 1857, the post office was removed from Jernigan, and opened under the name of Orlando at a new location in present-day downtown Orlando. During the American Civil War, the post office closed, but reopened in 1866. The move is believed to have been sparked, in part, by Aaron Jernigan&#x27;s fall from grace after he was relieved of his militia command by military officials in 1856. His behavior was so notorious that United States Secretary of War Jefferson Davis wrote, &quot;It is said they [Jernigan&#x27;s militia] are more dreadful than the Indians.&quot; In 1859, Jernigan and his sons were accused of committing a murder at the town&#x27;s post office. They were then transported to Ocala, but escaped.

At a meeting in 1857, debate had grown concerning the name of the town. Pioneer William B. Hull recalled how James Speer (a local resident, and prominent figure in the stories behind the naming of Orlando) rose in the heat of the argument and said, &quot;This place is often spoken of as &#x27;Orlando&#x27;s Grave.&#x27; Let&#x27;s drop the word &#x27;grave&#x27; and let the county seat be Orlando.&quot;

The origin of the name is unknown but at least five stories relate how Orlando got its name. The most common stories are that the name Orlando originated from the tale of a man who died in 1835 during an attack by Native Americans in the area during the Second Seminole War. Several of the stories relay an oral history of the marker for a person named Orlando, and the &quot;double entendre&quot;, &quot;Here lies Orlando.&quot; One variant includes a man named Orlando who was passing by on his way to Tampa with a herd of oxen, died, and was buried in a marked grave.

Through a retelling of history, a marker of some sort was believed to have been found by one of the original pioneers, but Speer&#x27;s family has since claimed that Speer simply used the Orlando Reeves legend to help push his plan for naming the settlement after the Shakespearean character from &quot;As You Like It&quot;, his favorite play. This has become the most common accepted version of how Orlando got its name.

===Orlando Reeves===

Historians agree that likely no soldier was named Orlando Reeves. Folklore is that Reeves was acting as a sentinel for a company of soldiers that had set up camp for the night on the banks of Sandy Beach Lake. Several different lakes are mentioned in the various versions, as no soldiers were in what is now downtown during 1835.

The legend grew throughout the early 1900s, particularly with local historian Olive Brumbaugh (or Kena Fries) retelling in various writings and on local radio station WDBO in 1929. Another historian, Eldon H. Gore, promoted the Reeves legend in &quot;History of Orlando&quot; published in 1949. A memorial beside Lake Eola – originally placed by students of Orlando&#x27;s Cherokee Junior School in 1939 and updated in 1990 – designates the spot where the city&#x27;s supposed namesake fell.

Conflicting legends exist. One legend has Reeves killed during an extended battle with the Seminoles after being field promoted after his platoon commander fell. An in-depth review of military records in the 1970s and 1980s, though, turned up no record of Orlando Reeves ever existing. Some versions attempt to account for Reeves having no military records by using the name of other people named Orlando that exist in some written records – Orlando Acosta; however, not much is known about Acosta or whether he even existed. Another version of the story has Orlando Reed, supposedly an Englishman and mail carrier between Fort Gatlin and Fort Mellon, allegedly killed while camping with his friends near Fort Gatlin.

A second variation also places the story in 1835 during the Second Seminole War. This name is taken from a South Carolinian cattle rancher named Orlando Savage Rees. Rees owned a Volusia County sugar mill and plantation, as well as several large estates in Florida and Mississippi. Rees&#x27; sugar farms in the area were burned out in the Seminole attacks of 1835 (the year Orlando Reeves supposedly died). Subsequently, Rees led an expedition to recover stolen slaves and cattle. In 1837, Rees also attempted to stop a peace treaty with the Seminoles because it did not reimburse him for the loss of slaves and crops.

Rees could have left a pine-bough marker with his name next to the trail; later residents misread &quot;Rees&quot; as &quot;Reeves&quot; and also mistook it as a grave maker. In subsequent years, this story has merged with the Orlando Reeves story (which may have originally incorporated part of Dr. Gatlin&#x27;s story).

On two separate occasions, relatives of Rees claimed their ancestor was the namesake of the city. F. K. Bull of South Carolina (Rees&#x27; great-grandson) told an Orlando reporter of a story in 1955; years later, Charles M. Bull Jr., of Orlando (Rees&#x27; great-great-grandson) offered local historians similar information. Unlike Orlando Reeves, who cannot be traced to any historical record, the record is considerable that Orlando Rees did exist and was in Florida during that time. For example, in 1832, John James Audubon met with Rees in his large estate at Spring Garden, about 45 minutes from Orlando.

===Orlando (&quot;As You Like It&quot;)===
The final variation has the city named after the protagonist in the Shakespeare play &quot;As You Like It&quot;.

In 1975, Judge Donald A. Cheney put forth a new version of the story in an &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; article. Cheney (a local historian and then chairman of the county historical commission) recounted a story told to him by his father, Judge John Moses Cheney (a major figure in Orlando&#x27;s history, who arrived in Orlando in 1885).

The elder Cheney recounted that another gentleman at that time, James Speer, proposed the name Orlando after the character in &quot;As You Like It&quot;. According to Cheney, Speer, &quot;was a gentleman of culture and an admirer of William Shakespeare ...&quot; Quoting a letter that Speer wrote, &quot;Orlando was a veritable Forest of Arden, the locale of &quot;As You Like It&quot;.&quot; Speer&#x27;s descendants have also confirmed this version of the naming and the legend has continued to grow.

This account also has some validity in that, as mentioned above, Speer was instrumental in changing the name of the settlement from Jernigan to Orlando, though he may have used the Orlando Reeves legend in lieu of his true intent to use the Shakespearean character. According to yet another version of the story, Orlando may have been the name of one of his employees. One of downtown Orlando&#x27;s major streets is named Rosalind Avenue; Rosalind is the heroine of &quot;As You Like It&quot;, but this could also be a coincidence.

==History==

===Settlement===

In 1823, the Treaty of Moultrie Creek created a Seminole reservation encompassing much of central Florida, including the area that would become Orlando. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 authorized relocation of the Seminole from Florida to Oklahoma, leading to the Second Seminole War. In 1842, white settlement in the area was encouraged by the Armed Occupation Act. The first settler, Aaron Jernigan of Camden County, Georgia, arrived the following year and settled near Lake Holden.

Mosquito County was renamed Orange County in 1845, with the county seat shortly thereafter relocated to Mellonville, a few miles west of Sanford. By 1856, settlement had begun in earnest in the interior of the county and a more centrally-located Courthouse was sought. The new town of Orlando, laid out in 1857, consisted of four streets surrounding a courthouse square. The fledgling village suffered greatly during the Union blockade. The Reconstruction Era brought on a population explosion, resulting in the incorporation of the Town of Orlando on July 31, 1875, with 85 residents (22 voters). For a short time in 1879, the town revoked its charter, and was subsequently reincorporated. Orlando was established as a city in 1885.

The period from 1875 to 1895 is remembered as Orlando&#x27;s Golden Era, when it became the hub of Florida&#x27;s citrus industry. The period ended with the Great Freeze of 1894–95, which forced many owners to give up their independent citrus groves, thus consolidating holdings in the hands of a few &quot;citrus barons&quot;, who shifted operations south, primarily around Lake Wales in Polk County. The freeze caused many in Florida, including many Orlandoans, to move elsewhere, mostly to the North, California, or the Caribbean.

Notable homesteaders in the area included the Curry family. Through their property in east Orlando flowed the Econlockhatchee River, which travelers crossed by fording. This was commemorated by the street&#x27;s name, Curry Ford Road. Also, just south of the Orlando International Airport in the Boggy Creek area are of property homesteaded in the late 19th century by the Ward family. This property is still owned by the Ward family, and can be seen from southbound flights out of Orlando International Airport immediately on the south side of SR 417.

===Post-Industrial Revolution===

Orlando became a popular resort during the years between the Spanish–American War and World War I. In the 1920s, Orlando experienced extensive housing development during the Florida Land Boom, causing land prices to soar. During this period, dozens of neighborhoods in the vicinity of downtown were constructed. The boom ended when several hurricanes hit Florida in the late 1920s, along with the Great Depression.

During World War II, a number of Army personnel were stationed at the Orlando Army Air Base and nearby Pinecastle Army Air Field. Some of these servicemen stayed in Orlando to settle and raise families. In 1956, the aerospace and defense company Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin) established a plant in the city. Orlando AAB and Pinecastle AAF were transferred to the United States Air Force in 1947 when it became a separate service and were redesignated as air force bases (AFB). In 1958, Pinecastle AFB was renamed McCoy Air Force Base after Colonel Michael N. W. McCoy, a former commander of the 320th Bombardment Wing at the installation, killed in the crash of a B-47 Stratojet bomber north of Orlando. In the 1960s, the base subsequently became home to the 306th Bombardment Wing of the Strategic Air Command, operating B-52 Stratofortress and KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft, in addition to detachment operations by EC-121 and U-2 aircraft.

In 1968, Orlando AFB was transferred to the United States Navy and became Naval Training Center Orlando. In addition to boot camp facilities, the NTC Orlando was home of one of two Navy Nuclear Power Schools, and home of the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division. When McCoy AFB closed in 1976, its runways and territory to its south and east were imparted to the city to become Orlando International Airport, while a small portion to the northwest was transferred to the Navy as McCoy NTC Annex. That closed in 1995, and became a housing, though the former McCoy AFB still hosts a Navy Exchange, as well as national guard and reserve units for several branches of service. NTC Orlando was completely closed by the end of 1999 by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, and converted into the Baldwin Park neighborhood. The Naval Air Warfare Center had moved to Central Florida Research Park near UCF in 1989.


===Tourism in history===

A major factor in Orlando&#x27;s growth occurred in 1962, when the new Orlando Jetport, the precursor of the present-day Orlando International Airport, was built from a portion of the McCoy Air Force Base. By 1970, four major airlines (Delta Air Lines, National Airlines, Eastern Airlines, and Southern Airways) were providing scheduled flights. McCoy Air Force Base officially closed in 1975, and most of it is now part of the airport. The airport still retains the former Air Force Base airport code (MCO).

Perhaps the most critical event for Orlando&#x27;s economy, though, occurred in 1965 when Walt Disney announced plans to build Walt Disney World. Although Disney had considered the regions of Miami and Tampa for his park, one of the major reasons behind his decision not to locate there was due to hurricanes – Orlando&#x27;s inland location, although not free from hurricane damage, exposed it to less threat than coastal regions. The vacation resort opened in October 1971, ushering in an explosive population and economic growth for the Orlando metropolitan area, which now encompasses Orange, Seminole, Osceola, and Lake Counties. As a result, tourism became the centerpiece of the area&#x27;s economy. Orlando now has more theme parks and entertainment attractions than anywhere else in the world.

===21st century===
Today, the historic core of &quot;Old Orlando&quot; resides in downtown Orlando along Church Street, between Orange Avenue and Garland Avenue.
The urban development and the central business district of downtown have rapidly shaped the downtown skyline during recent history. The present-day historic district is primarily associated with the neighborhoods around Lake Eola but stretches west across the city to Lake Lorna Doone and north into the College Park Neighborhood where you can find century-old oaks line brick streets. These neighborhoods include the &quot;Downtown Business District,&quot; &quot;North Quarter,&quot; &quot;Parramore,&quot; &quot;Callahan,&quot; &quot;South Eola Heights, &quot;Lake Eola Heights,&quot;Thornton Park&quot; and &quot;College Park&quot;, and contain some of the oldest homes in Orlando.

====2016 mass shooting====
On June 12, 2016, more than 100 people were shot at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. Fifty (including the gunman) were killed and 60 were wounded. The gunman, whom the police SWAT team shot to death, was identified as 29-year-old Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, an American security guard. The act of terrorism was both the deadliest mass shooting in modern United States history at the time and one of the deadliest mass shootings perpetrated by a single person in recorded world history. Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State during his unsuccessful negotiations with police. After the shooting, the city held numerous vigils. In November 2016, Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer announced the city&#x27;s intention to acquire the Pulse Nightclub to build a permanent memorial for the 49 victims of the shooting. The city offered to buy it for $2.25 million, but the club&#x27;s owner declined to sell.

==Geography==

The geography of Orlando is mostly wetlands, consisting of many lakes and swamps. The terrain is generally flat, making the land fairly low and wet. The area is dotted with hundreds of lakes, the largest of which is Lake Apopka. Central Florida&#x27;s bedrock is mostly limestone and very porous; the Orlando area is susceptible to sinkholes. Probably the most famous incident involving a sinkhole happened in 1981 in Winter Park, a city immediately north of downtown Orlando, dubbed &quot;The Winter Park Sinkhole&quot;.

===Cityscape===
====Neighborhoods====
There are 115 neighborhoods within the city limits and many unincorporated communities. Orlando&#x27;s city limits resemble a checkerboard, with pockets of unincorporated Orange County surrounded by city limits. Such an arrangement results in some areas being served by both Orange County and the City of Orlando. This also explains Orlando&#x27;s relatively low city population when compared to its metropolitan population. The city and county are working together in an effort to &quot;round-out&quot; the city limits with Orlando annexing portions of land already bordering the city limits.

At the center of the Greater Orlando region is Downtown Orlando, the historic core and central business district of the city. It is bordered by Marks Street in the north, Mills Avenue (SR 15) in the east, Orange Blossom Trail (US 441) in the west, and Kaley Avenue in the south. It is home to many of the region&#x27;s major banks, skyscrapers, government buildings, and cultural and tourist attractions, along with a large residential population. It is mostly composed of high-rise residential towers and office towers. Among the 79 of the high-rises in the Greater Orlando region, 46 are located in downtown. It is also the home to many of the city&#x27;s cultural venues, such as Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, Kia Center, and Orlando Museum of Art.

Southeast of Downtown is the rapidly growing neighborhood of Lake Nona. Along with being home to Lake Nona Golf &amp; Country Club, it is also the health district for the city, with Lake Nona Medical City. It features the University of Central Florida&#x27;s Health Sciences Campus, which includes the university&#x27;s College of Medicine, Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, the University of Central Florida College of Nursing, and the University of Central Florida College of Dental Medicine (along with a teaching hospital). The medical city also includes the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, Nemours Children&#x27;s Hospital, and University of Florida College of Pharmacy, in addition to the Orlando Veterans Administration Medical Center (which began seeing clinical patients in 2015).

In the southwestern side of Orlando, is the main tourist strip for the city, along with some residential neighborhoods. International Drive, commonly known as I-Drive, is a major thoroughfare in the southwestern section of Orlando, serving a similar purpose to that of the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas, as the core of the tourism area. The northern part of the strip extends into the city limits of and the remainder of the central and southern portions are all located in unincorporated Orange County. An additional extension is known as International Drive South, partly located in the northern portion of Osceola County, but is not connected to the main stem of this route. Surrounding cross-roads include Sand Lake Road, Kirkman Road, SR 536, and Universal Boulevard, which runs parallel to the midsection of International Drive. At its northern end, International Drive is home to Orlando International Premium Outlets and Universal Orlando resort, along with being in close proximity to the upcoming Epic Universe theme park (set to open in 2025). Further south on International Drive, it features the Madame Tussauds wax museum, the Orange County Convention Center, Pointe Orlando entertainment complex, SeaWorld Orlando (along with Aquatica, SeaWorld&#x27;s water park), Fun Spot America, ICON Park (featuring its famous ferris wheel, Orlando Eye), the World&#x27;s Largest Entertainment McDonald&#x27;s, and other tourist ventures. The Millennia neighborhood is a residential neighborhood that is also the home of The Mall at Millenia, an upscale super-regional mall. The mall&#x27;s Macy&#x27;s store was the first in Central Florida, and it was also one of only seven Macy&#x27;s stores in Florida that predated the company&#x27;s merger with Burdines. Bloomingdale&#x27;s and Neiman Marcus are also regional firsts and these remain their only locations in the Greater Orlando region.

The western side of Orlando includes various neighborhoods (within city limits, incorporated municipalities, and unincorporated within Orange County) with a wide a range of housing in differing class-levels. Neighborhoods in the western side of town include Apoka, Dr. Phillips, MetroWest, Pine Hills, and Windermere. The north side of Orlando, includes a wide range of older and more established neighborhoods, including Eatonville, Fern Park, Maitland, and Winter Park. Finally, the east side of Orlando includes neighborhoods such as Alafaya, Azalea Park, and Union Park. The east side is the home of the University of Central Florida (UCF). As of fall 2023, the university had a total enrollment of 69,320 students, making it the fourth-largest on-campus student body of any public university in the United States.

====Skyscrapers====

Metro Orlando has a total of 19 completed skyscrapers. The majority are located in downtown Orlando and the rest are located in the tourist district southwest of downtown. Skyscrapers built in downtown Orlando have not exceeded , since 1988, when the SunTrust Center was completed. The main reason for this is the Orlando Executive Airport, just under from the city center, which does not allow buildings to exceed a certain height without approval from the FAA.

===Climate===

According to the Köppen climate classification, Orlando has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) like much of the deep Southern United States. The two basic seasons in Orlando are a hot and rainy season, lasting from May until late October (roughly coinciding with the Atlantic hurricane season), and a warm and dry season from November through April. The area&#x27;s warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its low elevation, its position relatively close to the Tropic of Cancer, and its location in the center of a peninsula. Many characteristics of its climate are a result of its proximity to the Gulf Stream, which flows around the peninsula of Florida.

During the height of Orlando&#x27;s humid summer season, high temperatures are typically in the low 90s °F (32–34 °C), while low temperatures rarely fall below the low 70s °F (22–24 °C). The average window for temperatures is April 9 to October 14. The area&#x27;s humidity acts as a buffer, usually preventing actual temperatures from exceeding , but also pushing the heat index to over . The city&#x27;s highest recorded temperature is , set on September 8, 1921. During these months, strong afternoon thunderstorms occur almost daily. These storms are caused by air masses from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean colliding over Central Florida. They are highlighted by spectacular lightning and can also bring heavy rain (sometimes several inches per hour) and powerful winds as well as rare damaging hail.

During the winter, humidity is much lower and temperatures are more moderate, and can fluctuate more readily. The monthly daily average temperature in January is . Temperatures dip below the freezing mark on an average of only 1.6 nights per year and the lowest recorded temperature is , set on December 28, 1894. The annual mean minimum is just above putting Orlando in hardiness zone 10a. Because the winter season is dry and freezing temperatures usually occur only after cold fronts (and their accompanying precipitation) have passed, snow is exceptionally rare. The only accumulation ever to occur in the city proper since record keeping began was in 1948, although some accumulation occurred in surrounding areas in a snow event in January 1977 that reached Miami. Flurries have also been observed in 1989, 2006, and 2010.

The average annual rainfall in Orlando is , a majority of which occurs in the period from June to September. October through May are Orlando&#x27;s dry season. During this period (especially in its later months), often a wildfire hazard exists. During some years, fires have been severe. In 1998, a strong El Niño caused an unusually wet January and February, followed by drought throughout the spring and early summer, causing a record wildfire season that created numerous air-quality alerts in Orlando and severely affected normal daily life, including the postponement of that year&#x27;s Pepsi 400 NASCAR race in nearby Daytona Beach.

Orlando is a major population center and has a considerable hurricane risk, although it is not as high as in South Florida&#x27;s urban corridor or other coastal regions. Since the city is located inland from the Atlantic and inland from the Gulf of Mexico, hurricanes usually weaken before arriving. Storm surges are not a concern since the region is above mean sea level. Despite its location, the city does see strong hurricanes. During the notorious 2004 hurricane season, Orlando was hit by three hurricanes that caused significant damage, with Hurricane Charley the worst of these. The city also experienced widespread damage during Hurricane Donna in 1960. In recent years, hurricanes Irma (2017), Ian (2022), and Milton (2024) brought some notable damages to the city.

Tornadoes are not usually connected with the strong thunderstorms of the humid summer. They are more common during the infrequent cold days of winter, as well as in passing hurricanes. The two worst major outbreaks in the area&#x27;s history, a 1998 outbreak that killed 42 people and a 2007 outbreak that killed 21, both happened in February.

==Demographics==

===2020 census===
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 307,573 people, 113,238 households, and 61,667 families residing in the city.

As of the 2010 United States census, there were 238,300 people, 97,661 households, and 51,716 families residing in the city.

In 2014, the city&#x27;s population was spread out, with 12.0% under the age of 18, 5.7% from 18 to 24, 27.3% from 25 to 44, 18.6% from 45 to 64, and 36.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.3 males.

Orlando not only has the largest population of Puerto Ricans in Florida, but it is also home to the fastest-growing Puerto Rican community on the mainland US. Between 1980 and 2010, the overall Latino/Hispanic population in Orlando increased from 4.1 to 25.4%. In addition to Puerto Ricans, Cubans also have a large presence in the city. Orlando also has a large and growing Brazilian population, and is a popular travel destination for many Brazilians. There are Brazilian restaurants and shops located on International Drive and, in addition to Spanish and English, Portuguese-language signs and information can be found throughout Orlando International Airport.

A large Caribbean population is also present in Orlando, with a significant West Indian community (particularly Bahamians, Dominicans, Jamaicans, Guyanese people—of both Indian and African descent—and Trinidadian and Tobagonian populations) and an established Haitian community. Orlando has a considerable Muslim population, and an active Jewish community as well.

Orlando has a large LGBT+ population and is recognized as one of the most accepting and tolerant cities in the Southeast. , around 4.1% of Orlando&#x27;s population identify as LGBT+, making Orlando the city with the 20th-highest percentage of LGBT residents in the country. The city is host to Gay Days every June (a Pride Month event at Walt Disney World), holds a huge Pride festival and parade every October (since 2005), and is home to Florida&#x27;s first openly gay City Commissioner, Patty Sheehan.

According to the National Immigration Forum, the majority of Orlando&#x27;s foreign-born population are from Latin America (64.1%): Mexico (35,357), Colombia (30,967), Haiti (29,464); Asia (17.3%): Philippines (13,267), India (12,610), Vietnam (11,407); Europe (12.4%): United Kingdom (14,395), Germany (8,358), Italy (3,302) and Africa (3.0%): Morocco (2,846), Egypt (1,306), South Africa (1,295).

===Languages===
As of 2000, 75% of all residents speak English as their first language, while 16.60% speak Spanish, 1.9% speak Haitian Creole, 1.3% speak French, 0.99% speak Portuguese, and 0.5% of the population speak Arabic as their mother language. In total, 24% of the population 5 years and older speak a language other than English at home.

According to the American Community Survey of 2006–2008, 69% of Orlando&#x27;s residents over the age of five spoke only English at home. Spanish-speakers represented 19.2% of Orlando&#x27;s population. Speakers of other Indo-European languages made up 9% of the city&#x27;s population. Those who spoke an Asian language made up 1% of the population, and speakers of other languages made up the remaining 0.6% of the populace.

===Metropolitan statistical area===
Orlando is the hub city of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, colloquially known as &quot;Greater Orlando&quot; or &quot;Metro Orlando&quot;. The area encompasses four counties (Lake, Orange, Osceola, and Seminole). As of 2020, the population of the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was 2,673,376, making it the third largest in Florida and the 22nd-largest metro area in the United States.

When Combined Statistical Areas (CSA) were instituted in 2000, Orlando was initially joined with The Villages, Florida, Micropolitan Statistical Area, to form the &quot;Orlando-The Villages, Florida, Combined Statistical Area&quot;. In 2006, the metropolitan areas of Deltona (Volusia County) and Palm Coast (Flagler County) were added to create the &quot;Orlando-Deltona-Daytona Beach, Florida, Combined Statistical Area&quot;. As of 2020, the CSA has been renamed the Orlando–Lakeland–Deltona, Florida Combined Statistical Area and had the 15th highest population in the US, with a total of 4,197,095 people.

==Economy==


===Industry===

Orlando is a major industrial and hi-tech center. The metro area has a $13.4 billion technology industry employing 53,000 people; and is a nationally recognized cluster of innovation in digital media, agricultural technology, aviation, aerospace, and software design. More than 150 international companies, representing approximately 20 countries, have facilities in Metro Orlando.

Orlando has the 7th-largest research park in the country, Central Florida Research Park, with over . It is home to over 120 companies, employs more than 8,500 people, and is the hub of the nation&#x27;s military simulation and training programs. Near the end of each year, the Orange County Convention Center hosts the world&#x27;s largest modeling and simulation conference: Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC). Metro Orlando is home to the simulation procurement commands for the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard.

Lockheed Martin has a large manufacturing facility for missile systems, aeronautical craft and related high-tech research. Other notable engineering firms have offices or labs in Metro Orlando: KDF, General Dynamics, Harris, Mitsubishi Power Systems, Siemens, Veritas/Symantec, multiple United States Air Force facilities, Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division, Delta Connection Academy, Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University, General Electric, Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation, U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), United States Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, United States Army Simulation and Training Technology Center, AT&amp;T, Boeing, CAE Systems Flight and Simulation Training, Hewlett-Packard, Institute for Simulation and Training, National Center for Simulation, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon. The Naval Training Center until a few years ago was one of the two places where nuclear engineers were trained for the United States Navy. Now the land has been converted into the Baldwin Park development. Numerous office complexes for large corporations have popped up along the Interstate 4 corridor north of Orlando, especially in Maitland, Lake Mary and Heathrow.

Orlando is close enough to Patrick Space Force Base, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, and Kennedy Space Center for residents to commute to work from the city&#x27;s suburbs. It also allows easy access to Port Canaveral, a cruise ship terminal.

Orlando is the home base of Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, and the largest operator of casual dining restaurants in the world by revenue. In September 2009 it moved to a new headquarters and central distribution facility.

Former Darden Restaurants subsidiary Red Lobster is based in Downtown Orlando.

===Film, television, and entertainment===

Another important sector is the film, television, and electronic gaming industries, aided by the presence of Universal Studios, Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios, Full Sail University, UCF College of Arts and Humanities, the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy, and other entertainment companies and schools. The U.S. modeling, simulation, and training (MS&amp;T) industry is centered on the Orlando region as well, with a particularly strong presence in the Central Florida Research Park adjacent to University of Central Florida (UCF). Nearby Maitland is the home of Tiburon, a division of the video game company Electronic Arts. Tiburon Entertainment was acquired by EA in 1998 after years of partnership, particularly in the Madden NFL series and NCAA Football series of video games. Nearby Full Sail University, located in Winter Park, draws new-media students in the areas of video game design, film, show production, and computer animation, among others, its graduates spawning several start-ups in these fields in the Orlando area. The headquarters of Ripley Entertainment Inc. are also located in Orlando.

===Healthcare===

Orlando has two non-profit hospital systems: Orlando Health and AdventHealth. Orlando Health&#x27;s Orlando Regional Medical Center is home to Central Florida&#x27;s only Level I trauma center, and Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies and AdventHealth Orlando have the area&#x27;s only Level III neonatal intensive care units. Orlando&#x27;s medical leadership was further advanced with the completion of University of Central Florida&#x27;s College of Medicine, a new VA Hospital and the new Nemours Children&#x27;s Hospital, which is located in a new medical district in the Lake Nona area of the city.

===Housing and employment===

Historically, the unemployment rate in Greater Orlando was low, which resulted in growth that led to urban sprawl in the surrounding area and, in combination with the United States housing bubble, to a large increase in home prices. Metro Orlando&#x27;s unemployment rate in June 2010 was 11.1 percent, was 11.4 percent in April 2010, and was about 10 percent in about the same time of year in 2009. As of August 2013, the area&#x27;s jobless rate was 6.6 percent. Housing prices in Greater Orlando went up 37.08% in one year, from a median of $182,300 in November 2004 to $249,900 in November 2005, and eventually peaked at $264,436 in July 2007. From there, with the economic meltdown, prices plummeted, with the median falling below $200,000 in September 2008, at one point falling at an annual rate of 39.27%.

===Tourism===
 One of the main driving forces in Orlando&#x27;s economy is its tourism industry and the city is one of the leading tourism destinations in the world. Nicknamed the &#x27;Theme Park Capital of the World&#x27;, the Orlando area is home to Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando, SeaWorld Orlando, Legoland Florida and Fun Spot America Theme Parks. A record 75 million visitors came to the Orlando region in 2018, making it the top tourist destination in the United States.

The Orlando area features 7 of the 10 most visited theme parks in North America (5 of the top 10 in the world), as well as the 4 most visited water parks in the U.S. The Walt Disney World resort is the area&#x27;s largest attraction with its many facets such as the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios, Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom, Disney&#x27;s Typhoon Lagoon, Disney&#x27;s Blizzard Beach and Disney Springs. Universal Orlando, like Walt Disney World, is a multi-faceted resort comprising Universal Studios Florida, Universal Islands of Adventure, Universal Volcano Bay, Universal CityWalk, and the soon to be Epic Universe. SeaWorld Orlando is a large park that features numerous zoological displays and marine animals alongside an amusement park with roller coasters like Mako, Manta, and Kraken. The property also comprises more than one park, alongside Aquatica water park and Discovery Cove. Fun Spot Orlando and Kissimmee are more typical amusement parks with big thrills in a small space with roller coasters like White Lightning and Freedom Flyer in Orlando and Mine Blower and Rockstar Coaster in Kissimmee. Orlando is also home to I-Drive 360 on International Drive home to The Wheel at ICON Park, Madame Tussauds, and Sealife Aquarium. Orlando attractions also appeal to many locals who want to enjoy themselves close to home.

The convention industry is also critical to the region&#x27;s economy. The Orange County Convention Center, expanded in 2004 to over of exhibition space, is now the second-largest convention complex in terms of space in the United States, trailing only McCormick Place in Chicago.

==Culture==

===Film===

In the mid-to-late 1990s, Orlando was known as &quot;Hollywood East&quot; because of numerous film production studios in the area, although such activity has slowed down considerably into the 2000s. Perhaps the most famous film-making moment in the city&#x27;s history occurred with the implosion of Orlando&#x27;s previous City Hall for the movie &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot;. The same year, Orlando native Wesley Snipes starred in the film &quot;Passenger 57&quot;, which was shot predominantly in his hometown. For the next decade, Orlando was production center for television shows, direct-to-video productions, and commercial production. In 1997, Walt Disney Feature Animation operated a studio in Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios in Walt Disney World. The feature animation studio produced the films &quot;Mulan&quot;, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;, and the early stages of &quot;Brother Bear&quot;, but shutdown in 2004 due to the company&#x27;s newfound focus on computer animation. Universal Studios Florida&#x27;s Soundstage 21 is home to TNA Wrestling&#x27;s flagship show TNA Impact!. Nickelodeon Studios, which through the 1990s produced hundreds of hours of GAK-filled game shows targeted at children, no longer operates out of Universal Studios Florida. In the 2000s–2020s, entertainment related operations have predominantly consolidated the city&#x27;s tourism-related businesses — namely events, concerts, hotels, and trade shows.

The Florida Film Festival, which takes place in venues throughout the area, is one of the most respected regional film festivals in the country and attracts budding filmmakers from around the world. Orlando&#x27;s indie film scene has been active since Haxan Film&#x27;s &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; (1999) and a few years later with Charlize Theron winning her Academy Award for &quot;Monster&quot; (2003). A Florida state film incentive has also helped increase the number of films being produced in Orlando and the rest of the state.

===Theater and performing arts===

The Orlando Metropolitan Area is home to a substantial theater population. Several professional and semi-professional houses and many community theaters include the Central Florida Ballet, Orlando Ballet, Orlando Shakespeare Theater, Opera Orlando, Orlando Family Stage, and IceHouse Theatre in Mount Dora. Orlando Theatre Project, closed in 2009. Additionally, both University of Central Florida and Rollins College (Winter Park) are home to theater departments that attract an influx of young artists to the area.

The Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre had hosted national Broadway tours on a regular basis. This venue was built in 1926 and underwent a major renovation in 1974. The Bob Carr has since closed due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and has yet to host a show since February 2020. While waiting on the completion of Phase II construction of the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, the newly designated Bob Carr Theater will continue to host non-Broadway events.

The Orlando International Fringe Theater Festival, which draws touring companies from around the world, is hosted in various venues over Orlando&#x27;s Loch Haven Park every spring. At the festival, there are also readings and fully staged productions of new and unknown plays by local artists. Also in the spring, there is The Harriett Lake Festival of New Plays, hosted by Orlando Shakespeare Theater. Founded in 2002, the Orlando Cabaret Festival showcases local, national, and internationally renowned cabaret artist to Mad Cow Theatre in Downtown Orlando each spring.

Classical Music and Music Theater are also represented. Orlando has two professional orchestras – the Orlando Symphony Orchestra, which was founded in 1991 when the Central Florida Friends of Music reorganized, and the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra, founded in 1993, the second of which also serves as the orchestra for productions of Opera Orlando, which developed when the Florida Opera Theater, founded in 2009, reorganized in 2016.

===Literary arts===

The indie literary presses Burrow Press and Autofocus are based in Orlando. There is also a large concentration of slam poets and poetry events in and around the metro area which has led to the city being dubbed Litlando. This name is fitting as legend goes that the city&#x27;s name and Rosalind Avenue in downtown Orlando were taken from characters from the Shakespeare play &quot;As You Like It&quot; while Lake Ivanhoe was named after the namesake character from the 1820 book, Ivanhoe, by Walter Scott.

===Music and local culture===

Orlando is home to numerous recording studios and producers, and as a result, contributed heavily to the boyband craze of the mid-1990s. The groups Backstreet Boys, N Sync, and O-Town were each formed in Orlando prior to their mainstream commercial breakthroughs. The alternative rock groups Matchbox Twenty, Seven Mary Three, and Alter Bridge hail from Orlando, as well as the Christian hip hop act Group 1 Crew. Orlando also has a prominent metal scene, spawning bands such as Death and Trivium. There are also hip hop music, metal, rock music, reggaeton and Latino music scenes that have all been active within the city.

A substantial amount of the teenage and young adult populations identify as being goth, emo, or punk. Orlando experienced its own Second Summer of Love between 1991 and 1992 that popularized the subculture surrounding electronic dance music in Florida. Over the years, the intensity of the music increased. In the late 1990s, Skrape, a metal band, was established, shortly followed by the screamo band From First to Last as well as the alternative metal band Fireflight. In the early 2000s, the heavy metal bands Trivium and Mindscar formed. In the later 2000s, more screamo bands, such as Blood on the Dance Floor, Sleeping with Sirens, and Broadway were established. The Vans Warped Tour, a concert containing metalcore/screamo/punk bands, takes place in Orlando annually. The American Awesome Alliance post-hardcore band formed in 2012.

Sprawling urban developments have led a number of hip hop artists from Orlando to garner mainstream recognition and sign with major labels, most notably Tyla Yaweh (signed to Epic Records), Hotboii (signed to Interscope Records) and 9lokkNine (signed to Cash Money Records). The 2019 single, &quot;223&#x27;s&quot; by YNW Melly and 9lokkNine, marked the first US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 entry of an 
Orlando-based hip hop act.

Gaming YouTuber Dream is based in Orlando. He has accumulated 40 million combined subscribers and signed a recording deal with Republic Records in 2023.

====Major highways====
* Interstate 4 is Orlando&#x27;s primary interstate highway. Orlando is the second-largest city served by only one interstate, surpassed only by Austin, Texas, and is the largest metropolitan area in the US serviced by a single interstate. The interstate begins in Tampa, Florida, and travels northeast across the midsection of the state directly through Orlando, ending in Daytona Beach. As a key connector to Orlando&#x27;s suburbs, downtown, area attractions, and both coasts, I-4 commonly experiences heavy traffic and congestion. I-4 is also known as State Road 400.
* East-West Expressway (Toll 408) is a major east–west highway managed by the Central Florida Expressway Authority. The highway intersects with I-4 in Downtown Orlando, providing a key artery for residents commuting from eastern and western suburbs including the University of Central Florida and Waterford Lakes area. The highway also intersects with the Central Florida Greeneway (Toll 417) and Florida&#x27;s Turnpike. By late 2006, the I-4/408 interchange had almost completed undergoing a major overhaul that creates multiple fly-over bridges and connectors to ease heavy traffic. The agency recently finished construction of lane expansions, new toll plazas, and sound barriers along the roadway, though much work remains to be done.

* Central Florida Greeneway (Toll 417) is a key highway for East Orlando, the highway is also managed by the Central Florida Expressway Authority and serves as Orlando&#x27;s eastern beltway. The highway intersects with the East-West Expressway (Toll 408), the Beachline Expressway (Toll 528), and begins and ends on Interstate 4.
* Daniel Webster Western Beltway (Toll 429) serves as Orlando&#x27;s western beltway. It is managed jointly by the Florida Turnpike and the Central Florida Expressway Authority.

===Rail===

The Orlando area is served by one through railroad. The line, now known as the Central Florida Rail Corridor (CFRC), was previously known as the &quot;A&quot; line (formerly the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad&#x27;s main line). The line was purchased from CSX Transportation by the State of Florida in 2013 and is now used by SunRail, the Central Florida commuter rail system. Some freight spurs still exist off the line, which are operated by the Florida Central Railroad. Amtrak passenger service runs along CFRC. See also a map of these railroads.

Amtrak intercity passenger rail service operates from the Orlando Amtrak Station south of downtown. The Mission Revival-style station has been in continuous use since 1927, first for the Atlantic Coast Line, then the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (signage for which is still displayed over the station&#x27;s main entrance). Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and &quot;Silver Star&quot; service Orlando four times daily, twice bound for points north to New York City and twice bound for points south to Miami. Orlando also serves as a transfer hub for Amtrak Thruway bus service. Orlando Station has the highest Amtrak ridership in the state, with the exception of the &quot;Auto Train&quot; depot located in nearby Sanford. Orlando was also served by the thrice-weekly &quot;Sunset Limited&quot;. The &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; route was truncated at San Antonio, Texas as a result of the track damage in the Gulf Coast area caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 28, 2005. Service was restored as far east as New Orleans by late October 2005, but Amtrak currently has service suspended between Mobile and Orlando.

Historically, Orlando&#x27;s other major railroad stations have included:
* Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Orlando station (now Church Street Station, a commercial development)
* Seaboard Air Line Railroad Orlando station (Central Avenue Station; 1898–1955).

====Commuter rail====

In 2005, federal and state funding was granted for the establishment of SunRail, a local commuter rail service, to operate on the former CSX &quot;A&quot; line tracks between DeLand and Poinciana, passing through the downtown area and surrounding urban neighborhoods along the way. The service is expected to substantially reduce traffic congestion along the I-4 corridor, especially between Downtown Orlando and the suburban communities in Seminole and Volusia Counties. Federal and state funds covered approximately 80% of the estimated $400 million cost for track modifications and construction of stations along the route. The counties involved approved local matching funds in 2007 and the line was originally projected to begin operations in 2011. However, the project was ultimately voted down by Florida State Senate in 2008 and again in 2009 due to an amendment that would have approved a $200 million insurance policy for the system. Although there had been growing concern the system would be scrapped, a deadline extension combined with a new insurance arrangement with CSX brought new hope that SunRail will be completed after all. In a special session in December 2009, the Florida Legislature approved commuter rail for Florida, which also enabled high-speed rail federal funding. SunRail began passenger service on May 1, 2014. Phase I of the rail system runs from DeBary to Sand Lake Road in South Orlando. Phase II, connects DeBary and continues north to DeLand, as well as extending from Sand Lake Road in Orlando south to Poinciana. Attempts to establish a smaller light rail service for the Orlando area were also considered at one time, but were also met with much resistance.

====Inter-city rail====

A privately funded initiative known as &quot;All Aboard Florida&quot;, which would provide inter-city rail service from Miami to Orlando, was announced in March 2012. Now known as Brightline, the train currently runs from Downtown Miami to the Orlando International Airport Intermodal Terminal. The Orlando extension includes of new railway track and top speeds reach , becoming one of the fastest rail services in the United States. Service to Orlando began on September 22, 2023. Future plans are underway to add a station near Disney Springs.

===Bus===
Lynx provides local transit service covering a five-county area: Orange, Seminole, Osceola, Polk, and Volusia. Lynx bus frequency varies depending on the route and time of day.

Greyhound Lines offers intercity bus service from Orlando to multiple locations across the country. The Orlando Greyhound Station is located west of Downtown Orlando.

Having a very well-developed tourism industry and millions of visitors per year the City of Orlando has multiple options for groups arriving and touring the city and surrounding areas by local charter bus companies.

===Taxi===

Orlando is served by a collection of independently owned taxi companies. In downtown Orlando, taxis can be hailed on a regular basis. Taxis are also available in and around the Amway Center, Orlando Convention Center, and all major attractions/theme parks.

<text>Terre Haute ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Vigo County, Indiana, United States, about east of the state&#x27;s western border with Illinois. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 58,389 and its metropolitan area had a population of 168,716.

Located along the Wabash River, Terre Haute is one of the largest cities in the Wabash Valley and is known as the Queen City of the Wabash. The city is home to multiple higher-education institutions, including Indiana State University, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, and Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana. It also contains the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, which houses the US federal death row.

==History==
Terre Haute&#x27;s name is derived from the French phrase &quot;terre haute&quot; (pronounced in French), meaning &quot;highland&quot;. It was named by French-Canadian explorers and fur trappers to the area in the early 18th century to describe the unique location above the Wabash River (see French colonization of the Americas). At the time, the area was claimed by the French and British and these highlands were considered the border between Canada and Louisiana. 

The construction of Fort Harrison in 1811 marked the known beginning of a permanent population of European-Americans in the area that would become known as Terre Haute. A Wea Indian village already existed near the fort, and the orchards and meadows they kept a few miles south of the fort became the site of the present-day city. (Terre Haute&#x27;s currently affiliated Order of the Arrow lodge of the Boy Scouts of America is named after the last leader of the Wea village, Jacco Godfroy.) The village of Terre Haute, then a part of Knox County, Indiana, was platted in 1816.

Terre Haute became the county seat of the newly formed Vigo County in 1818, leading to increased population growth. The village&#x27;s estimated 1,000 residents voted to incorporate in 1832; the village was elevated to city status in 1853.

Early Terre Haute was a center of farming, milling, and pork processing. However, the city&#x27;s pre-1960 business and industrial expansion occurred largely due to transportation. The Wabash River, the building of the National Road (now US 40), and the Wabash and Erie Canal linked Terre Haute to the world and broadened the city&#x27;s range of influence. The economy was based on iron and steel mills, hominy plants, and late in the 19th century, distilleries, breweries, and bottle makers. Coal mines and coal operating companies developed to support the railroads, yet agriculture remained predominant, largely due to the role of corn in making alcoholic beverages and food items.

With steady growth and development in the latter part of the 19th century, the city&#x27;s vibrant neighborhoods benefited from improved fire protection, the founding of two hospitals, dozens of churches, and a number of outlets for amusement. Terre Haute&#x27;s position as an educational hub was fostered as several institutions of higher education were established. The city developed a reputation for its arts and entertainment offerings. Grand opera houses were built that hosted hundreds of operas and theatrical performances. It became a stop on the popular vaudeville circuit. The development of the streetcar system and later the electric-powered trolleys in the 1890s allowed residents to travel with ease to baseball games, picnics, river excursions, amusement parks, and even horse racing. The famous &quot;Four-Cornered&quot; Racetrack, now the site of Memorial Stadium, was laid out in 1886 and drew the best of the country&#x27;s trotters and drivers.

On the evening of Easter Sunday, March 23, 1913, a major tornado struck the city around 9:45 pm, demolishing more than 300 homes, killing 21 people, and injuring 250. Damage to local businesses and industries was estimated at $1 million to $2 million (in 1913 dollars). Up to that time, it was the deadliest tornado to hit Indiana. Heavy rains followed the tornado, causing the Wabash River to rise. By midday on Tuesday, March 25, West Terre Haute (Taylorville) was three-quarters submerged.

Like all U.S. communities, Terre Haute experienced economic swings as the country&#x27;s economic base evolved. Before the Great Depression brought the U.S. economy to a near halt, influences such as Prohibition and the decline of the country&#x27;s railroads had a negative effect on two of Terre Haute&#x27;s major industries - distilleries/breweries and railroad repair works.In 1940, though, it was selected for a new United States penitentiary built on south of the city.

World War II brought an economic upswing with the development of three ordnance plants in the county and the revitalization of the coal, railroad, and agriculture industries. Terre Haute remained dependent on consumer manufacturers such as Quaker Maid, the world&#x27;s largest food processing factory under one roof. The city was an enthusiastic participant in the war effort with troop send-offs, victory gardens, bond sales, civil defense drills, parades, and ceremonies. The country&#x27;s 100th United Service Organizations (USO) facility opened in the city in 1943.

Following the war, Terre Haute gained several new factories: Pfizer (1948), Allis-Chalmers (1951), Columbia Records (1954), and Anaconda Aluminum (1959). The face of downtown Terre Haute began to change in the late 1960s when Interstate 70 was built, passing through Vigo County about south of the path of U.S. 40 Wabash Avenue). As traffic began to concentrate at the U.S. 41 interchange, many downtown businesses relocated to Honey Creek Mall shopping center, built in 1968.

Throughout the period, civic groups developed to work toward boosting the economy. The Terre Haute Committee for Area Progress developed the Fort Harrison Industrial Park in the 1970s. Grow Terre Haute in the mid-1980s encouraged the establishment of new stores, factories, and high-tech industrial parks that helped to stabilize the economy and enhance community life. Most encouraging was the arrival of the Digital Audio Disc Corporation (DADC), a subsidiary of the global company, Sony, as the first American factory designed exclusively to make compact discs. In other developments over these years, railroad overpasses eased traffic congestion, law enforcement strengthened, and several national and state awards for volunteerism and citizen participation boosted local pride.

Like other Midwest manufacturing cities, Terre Haute faced daunting challenges as it neared the end of the 20th century, including the outmigration of the population and the closure of long-time manufacturing operations.

Much of the city&#x27;s resiliency can be attributed to the diversity of the local economy. Manufacturing continues to be an important part of that, due to the formation of the Vigo County Industrial Park. The efforts of the Terre Haute Economic Development Corporation, in cooperation with city and county government, have made the industrial park home to some of the world&#x27;s leading companies – Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional’s cold-rolled steel-processing facility, Staples Corporation’s Midwest Distribution Center, Advics automotive brake systems manufacturing facility, ThyssenKrupp Presta’s automotive steering systems manufacturing facility, and CertainTeed’s fiber cement board manufacturing plant.

The revitalization of the downtown area can be traced to the construction of First Financial Bank&#x27;s new headquarters building in the late 1980s and the creation of the city&#x27;s first tax increment financing district, which funded the first downtown parking structure. Over the years, more initiatives followed, including the construction of several new office buildings and a second downtown parking structure.

With the efforts of nonprofit groups such as Downtown Terre Haute and the expansion of the campus of Indiana State University, changes have spurred growth downtown. Several new hotels and businesses have been added to the &quot;Crossroads of America&quot; near 7th and Wabash, outdoor events and festivals attract crowds nearly every weekend during the summer, and the 7th Street Arts Corridor and Terre Haute Children&#x27;s Museum, completed in 2010, enhance the appeal of the downtown area. These developments over several years inspired property owners throughout downtown to rehabilitate and renovate their buildings, including Hulman &amp; Company. A new $25 million downtown convention center was completed in 2021.

Renovation of the city&#x27;s 1930s-era Federal Building to house Indiana State University&#x27;s Scott College of Business in 2010 and development of a new downtown location for Indiana State University Foundation and the university&#x27;s bookstore in 2011 strengthened ties between the city and the university. In 2015, Indiana State University partnered with developers to build a student housing facility in the heart of downtown, and other downtown residential development followed.

A casino was proposed to be built on the east side of the city near U.S. Route 40/Indiana Route 46. In November 2019, a referendum on whether to allow the casino to be built passed overwhelmingly and it was eventually opened in March 2024.

==Geography==
Terre Haute lies along the eastern bank of the Wabash River in western Indiana, about west of Indianapolis.

According to the 2010 census, Terre Haute has an area of , of which (or 2.08%) is covered by water.

The Wabash River dominates the city&#x27;s geography, forming its western border. Small bluffs on the east side of town mark the edge of the historic flood plain. Lost Creek and Honey Creek drain the city&#x27;s northern and southern sections, respectively. In the late 19th century (particularly during the oil craze of 1889), several oil and mineral wells were productive in and near the center of town. Pioneer Oil of Lawrenceville, Illinois, began drilling for oil at 10th and Chestnut Streets on the Indiana State University campus in December 2013, the first oil well drilled in downtown Terre Haute since 1903.

Terre Haute is at the intersection of two major roadways: U.S. 40, originally from California to Maryland, and US 41, from Copper Harbor, Michigan, to Miami, Florida. US 41 is now locally named 3rd Street, but historically was 7th Street, making &quot;7th and Wabash&quot; the Crossroads of America. Terre Haute is southwest of Indianapolis and within of Chicago, St. Louis, Louisville, and Cincinnati.

In Martin&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid&quot;, he mocked Terre Haute at the end. He saved the world from being decimated by a cheese bomb, and only Terre Haute was hit.

<text>Bhavānī (also known as Bhāvya, Tulajā, Turajā, Tvarita, Aṃbā, Jagadambā and Aṃbē) is an epithet associated with Durga. Bhavani translates to &quot;giver of life,&quot; meaning the power of nature or the source of creative energy. She is considered to be a nurturing mother figure who provides for her devotees and also plays the role of dispensing justice by killing &quot;evil Asuras&quot;.

==Etymology==
Bhavānī is an aspect of Durga, and she is considered to be a mother who provides well for her devotees and plays the role of dispensing justice by killing Asuras. However, According to the Śiva Purāṇa, Bhavānī is the supreme goddess. Bhavānī (भवानी, “the giver of existence”).—One of the names of the Goddess, Devī, who is regarded as the female principle of the divine; the embodiment of the energies of the Gods. Bhavānī (भवानी) is an epithet of the Goddess (Devī), who incarnated as Satī, according to the Śivapurāṇa 2.2.14. Accordingly, as Brahmā narrated to Nārada:—“[...] On seeing the mother of the universe born of Vīriṇī, Dakṣa joined his palms in reverence, paid respects to her, and eulogised her. [...] O mother of the universe, those who eulogise Thee with the names of Bhavānī, Ambikā, Jaganmāyā and Durgā will have everything”. The Goddess has a great variety of names referable to her various forms, attributes, and actions, but these names are not always used accurately and distinctively. As the mother of the world, she is Gauri, Maa Sherawali, Ambikā or Jagaṭ Jananī (the reading Jagaṭ Jananī/Jaga Jananī for Jaganmāyā is preferable). In her fiercer form, she is Durgā, the killer of Mahishasur.

==Temples of Bhavani==
The Bhavani Temple in Mahua, Bhavnagar, Gujarat, is believed to be over 5,000 years old, making it a site of immense historical and spiritual significance. Its ancient origins and enduring legacy attract devotees and history enthusiasts from all over the country.
The Tulja Bhavani temple in Tuljapur in the Osmanabad District of Maharashtra is considered one of the 51 Shakta pithas (pilgrimage sites). This temple was built close to the 12th century CE. Another Tulja Bhavani temple was constructed between 1537 and 1540 CE in Chittorgarh, located at coordinates .

==History==
Worship of the primeval energy, Shakti, in the form of the Mother Goddess, is seen in the four Shakta pithas of Maharashtra: Bhavānī, with her seat at Tuljapur, Mahalakshmi at Kolhapur, Mahamaya Renuka at Mahur, and Saptashrungi at Vani. Śrī Bhavānī Amman is also worshipped in the state of Tamil Nadu (Periyapalayam). Other Shakti temples in the Maharashtra state are those at Ambejogai, Aundh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.
The goddess Bhavānī is held in great reverence throughout Maharashtra. She is considered to be an embodiment of &quot;ugra&quot; or ferocity, as well as a Karunaswaroopini, an embodiment of mercy. A number of castes, sub-castes, and families from Maharashtra consider her their family deity or &quot;Kuladevata&quot;. The Bhavani temple in Tuljapur is located on a hill known as Yamunachala, on the slopes of the Sahayadri range in Maharashtra near Solapur. The temple entrance is elevated and visitors ascend a flight of steps to reach the shrine. 

Historic records speak of the existence of this temple from as early as the 12th century CE. Bhavānī is worshipped in the form of a granite image, tall, with eight arms that hold weapons and one hand in abhayā mūdra (giving blessings to devotees), she kills the demon Mahishasura in 4 different forms which are Katyayani (10-armed), Mahalakshmi (18-armed/1000 armed Devī Ćaṇḍika from Durgā Saptaśatī), Ugrachanda (18-armed) and Bhadrakali (16-armed). Legend says that a demon by the name of Matang wreaked havoc upon the devas and humans, who approached Brahma for help. 

Upon his advice, they turned to the Mother Goddess Shakti. She took the form of the destroyer and, empowered by the other Saptamātṛka (Brāhmaṇī, Vaiṣṇavī, Māheśvari, Indrāṇi, Kaumārī, Vārāhī, and Ćāmuṇḍā.), vanquished the demon and allowed the restoration of peace. Legend also describes how Bhavānī vanquished another demon who had taken the form of a wild buffalo, Mahishasura (hence her name Mahishasura Mardhini or &quot;the slayer of Mahisha the demon&quot;). Later, she is said to have taken abode on the Yamunachala hill, which is now home to the temple. Bhavānī is said to have come here to save Anubhuti from the demon known as Kukur. In a battle with the goddess, Kukur took the form of a buffalo; Bhavani cut off his head, and he then started changing into his original form. At that time, she stabbed her trident into his chest. Hence, she is in form of Mahishasura Mardini Durga. Four worship services are offered at the temple each day. 

The festivals of special significance are Gudi Padwa in the month of Chaitra, Shriral Sashti, Lalita Panchami, Makara Sankranti, and Rathasaptami. The statue of the deity is taken out in procession on Tuesdays. Navaratri is also celebrated with great fanfare, and it culminates in Vijaya Dasami. Sri Bhavani Devi is said to be Adi Parashakti herself, and the name Bhavani has several meanings. According to Lalitha Sahasranamam, &quot;Bhavānī&quot; means the deity who always helps devotees gain mukti. Adi Shankara said, &quot;A Person who recites the name &quot;Bhavani&quot; with true devotion thrice every day will not acquire sorrow, sin, illness and unexpected death.&quot; People occasionally confuse Bhavani devi with Renuka Devi; however, their stories are different. There are many texts which name Bhavani as the wife of Sadasiva.

Bhavai is also worshipped as clan deity by many Hindus, notably by many Rajput, Marathas, the Deshastha Brahmins of Maharashtra and the Agris of Konkan. According to local tradition, Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Empire, was presented with the &quot;Chandrahasa&quot; sword by Bhavani for the battle against evil.

===Image of Tulja Bhavani===
The image (&quot;murti&quot; ) of Tulja Bhavani is made of black stone, about in height and in width. The face of the goddess is described as beautiful and smiling. The goddess is asta-bhuja (with 8 hands) Durga. Her long hair is coming out of the crown.
She has a quiver on her back. The sun and the moon are present. Her lion stands near her. The image is self-manifested and movable. 

It is moved three times a year from its place to the bedroom of Mā Bhavānī. Below the lion, sage Markandeya is chanting the Durga-saptashati shlokas. The lady sage Anubhuti is on the left side of the goddess; she is in a hanging position and is meditating on the goddess. It is &quot;chala murti&quot;, moved thrice a year during the long sleeping periods of maa Bhavani. The face of Sati had fallen in Tuljapur, and due to this the face is decorated with saris and ornaments.
