<text>The Joker is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson, the character first appeared in the debut issue of the comic book &quot;Batman&quot; on April 25, 1940. Credit for the Joker&#x27;s creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for his design while acknowledging Finger&#x27;s writing contribution. Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman.

In the DC Universe, the Joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind and the antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance. He was introduced as a psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor but became a comical prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation by the Comics Code Authority, before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s. The Joker has been part of defining Batman stories, including the murder of Jason Todd—the second Robin and Batman&#x27;s ward—in &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; (1988) and the paralysis of Barbara Gordon—the first Batgirl—in &quot;&quot; (1988). Unlike many comic book characters, the Joker does not have a definitive origin story, but various possible ones have been developed. The most common story involves him falling into a tank of chemical waste that bleaches his skin white, turns his hair green and lips red, and leaves him with a rictus grin; the resulting disfigurement drives him insane.

The Joker possesses no superhuman abilities, instead using his expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions and thematic weaponry, including razor-tipped playing cards, deadly joy buzzers, and acid-spraying lapel flowers. The Joker sometimes works with other Gotham City supervillains, such as the Penguin and Two-Face, and groups like the Injustice Gang and Injustice League, but these partnerships often collapse due to the Joker&#x27;s desire for unbridled chaos. A romantic interest and sidekick for the Joker, his former psychiatrist Harley Quinn, was introduced in the 1990s. Although his primary obsession is Batman, the Joker has also fought other heroes, including Superman and Wonder Woman.

One of the most recognized characters in popular culture, the Joker has been listed among the greatest comic book villains and fictional characters ever created. His likeness has appeared on merchandise such as clothing and collectible items, and he has inspired real-world structures (such as theme park attractions) and been referenced in various media. The Joker has been adapted in live-action, animated, and video game incarnations.

==Creation and development==
===Concept===
Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson are credited with creating the Joker, but their accounts of the character&#x27;s conception differ, each providing his own version of events. Finger&#x27;s, Kane&#x27;s, and Robinson&#x27;s versions acknowledge that Finger showed them an image of actor Conrad Veidt in character as Gwynplaine (a man whose mouth is disfigured into a perpetual grin) in the 1928 film &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot; as an inspiration for the Joker&#x27;s appearance, and Robinson produced a sketch of a joker playing card.

Robinson stated that it was his 1940 card sketch that served as the character&#x27;s concept, and Finger associated that image with Veidt in the film. Kane hired the 17-year-old Robinson as an assistant in 1939, after he saw Robinson in a white jacket decorated with his own illustrations. Beginning as a letterer and background inker, Robinson quickly became primary artist for the newly created &quot;Batman&quot; comic book series. In a 1975 interview in &quot;The Amazing World of DC Comics&quot;, Robinson said he wanted a supreme arch-villain who could test Batman, not a typical crime lord or gangster designed to be easily disposed of. He wanted an exotic, enduring character as an ongoing source of conflict for Batman, designing a diabolically sinister, but clownish, villain. Robinson was intrigued by villains; he believed that some characters are made up of contradictions, leading to the Joker&#x27;s sense of humor. He said that the name came first, followed by an image of a playing card from a deck he often had at hand: &quot;I wanted somebody visually exciting. I wanted somebody that would make an indelible impression, would be bizarre, would be memorable like the Hunchback of Notre Dame or any other villains that had unique physical characters.&quot; He told Finger about his concept by telephone, later providing sketches of the character and images of what would become his Joker playing-card design. Finger thought the concept was incomplete, providing the image of Veidt with a ghastly, permanent rictus grin.

Kane countered that Robinson&#x27;s sketch was produced only after Finger had already shown the Gwynplaine image to Kane, and that it was only used as a card design belonging to the Joker in his early appearances. Finger said that he was also inspired by the Steeplechase Face, an image in Steeplechase Park at Coney Island that resembled a Joker&#x27;s head, which he sketched and later shared with future editorial director Carmine Infantino. In a 1994 interview with journalist Frank Lovece, Kane stated his position:

Robinson credited himself, Finger, and Kane for the Joker&#x27;s creation. He said he created the character as Batman&#x27;s larger-than-life nemesis when extra stories were quickly needed for &quot;Batman&quot; #1, and he received credit for the story in a college course:

Finger provided his own account in 1966:
Although Kane adamantly refused to share credit for many of his characters, and refuted Robinson&#x27;s claim for the rest of his life, many comic historians credit Robinson with the Joker&#x27;s creation and Finger with the character&#x27;s development. By 2011, Finger, Kane, and Robinson had died, leaving the story unresolved.

===Golden Age===

The Joker debuted in &quot;Batman&quot; #1 (April 1940) as the eponymous character&#x27;s first villain, about a year after Batman&#x27;s debut in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #27 (May 1939). The Joker initially appeared as a serial killer and jewel thief, modeled after a joker playing card with a mirthless grin, who killed his victims with &quot;Joker venom,&quot; a toxin that left their faces smiling grotesquely. The character was intended to be killed in his second appearance in &quot;Batman&quot; #1, after being stabbed in the heart. Finger wanted the Joker to die because of his concern that recurring villains would make Batman appear inept, but was overruled by then-editor Whitney Ellsworth; a hastily drawn panel, indicating that the Joker was still alive, was added to the comic. The Joker went on to appear in nine of &quot;Batman&quot;″s first 12 issues.

The character&#x27;s regular appearances quickly defined him as the archenemy of Batman and Robin; he killed dozens of people, and even derailed a train. By issue #13, Kane&#x27;s work on the syndicated &quot;Batman&quot; newspaper strip left him little time for the comic book; artist Dick Sprang assumed his duties, and editor Jack Schiff collaborated with Finger on stories. Around the same time, DC Comics found it easier to market its stories to children without the more mature pulp elements that had originated many superhero comics. During this period, the first changes in the Joker began to appear, portraying him as a wacky but harmless prankster; in one story, the Joker kidnaps Robin and Batman pays the ransom by check, meaning that the Joker cannot cash it without being arrested. Comic book writer Mark Waid suggests that the 1942 story &quot;The Joker Walks the Last Mile&quot; was the beginning point for the character&#x27;s transformation into a more goofy incarnation, a period that Grant Morrison considered to have lasted the following 30 years.

The 1942 cover of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #69, known as &quot;Double Guns&quot; (with the Joker emerging from a genie&#x27;s lamp, aiming two guns at Batman and Robin), is considered one of the greatest superhero comic covers of the Golden Age and is the only image from that era of the character using traditional guns. Robinson said that other contemporary villains used guns, and the creative team wanted the Joker—as Batman&#x27;s adversary—to be more resourceful.

===Silver Age===
The Joker was one of the few popular villains continuing to appear regularly in Batman comics from the Golden Age into the Silver Age, as the series continued during the rise in popularity of mystery and romance comics. In 1951, Finger wrote an origin story for the Joker in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #168, which introduced the characteristic of him formerly being the criminal Red Hood, and his disfigurement the result of a fall into a chemical vat.

By 1954, the Comics Code Authority had been established in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. The backlash was inspired by Frederic Wertham, who hypothesized that mass media (especially comic books) was responsible for the rise in juvenile delinquency, violence and homosexuality, particularly in young males. Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings. The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies.

The character appeared less frequently after 1964, when Julius Schwartz (who disliked the Joker) became editor of the Batman comics. The character risked becoming an obscure figure of the preceding era until this goofy prankster version of the character was adapted into the 1966 television series &quot;Batman&quot;, in which he was played by Cesar Romero. The show&#x27;s popularity compelled Schwartz to keep the comics in a similar vein. As the show&#x27;s popularity waned, however, so did that of the &quot;Batman&quot; comics. After the TV series ended in 1969, the increase in public visibility had not stopped the comic&#x27;s sales decline; editorial director Carmine Infantino resolved to turn things around, moving stories away from child-friendly adventures. The Silver Age introduced several of the Joker&#x27;s defining character traits: lethal joy buzzers, acid-squirting flowers, trick guns, and goofy, elaborate crimes.

===Bronze Age===

In 1973, after a four-year disappearance, the Joker was revived (and revised) by writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil and artist Neal Adams. Beginning with &quot;Batman&quot; #251&#x27;s &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Five-Way Revenge&quot;, the character returns to his roots as a homicidal maniac who matches wits with Batman. This story began a trend in which the Joker was used, sparingly, as a central character. O&#x27;Neil said his idea was &quot;simply to take it back to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after.&quot; O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s 1973 run introduced the idea of the Joker being legally insane, to explain why the character is sent to Arkham Asylum (introduced by O&#x27;Neil in 1974 as Arkham Hospital) instead of to prison. Adams modified the Joker&#x27;s appearance, changing his more average figure by extending his jaw and making him taller and leaner.

DC Comics was a hotbed of experimentation during the 1970s, and in 1975 the character became the first villain to feature as the title character in a comic book series, &quot;The Joker&quot;. The series followed the character&#x27;s interactions with other supervillains, and the first issue was written by O&#x27;Neil. Stories balanced between emphasizing the Joker&#x27;s criminality and making him a likable protagonist whom readers could support. Although he murdered thugs and civilians, he never fought Batman; this made &quot;The Joker&quot; a series in which the character&#x27;s villainy prevailed over rival villains, instead of a struggle between good and evil. Because the Comics Code Authority mandated punishment for villains, each issue ended with the Joker being apprehended, limiting the scope of each story. The series never found an audience, and &quot;The Joker&quot; was canceled after nine issues (despite a &quot;next issue&quot; advertisement for an appearance by the Justice League). The complete series became difficult to obtain over time, often commanding high prices from collectors. In 2013, DC Comics reissued the series as a trade paperback.

When Jenette Kahn became DC editor in 1976, she redeveloped the company&#x27;s struggling titles; during her tenure, the Joker would become one of DC&#x27;s most popular characters. While O&#x27;Neil and Adams&#x27; work was critically acclaimed, writer Steve Englehart and penciller Marshall Rogers&#x27;s eight-issue run in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #471–476 (August 1977–April 1978) defined the Joker for decades to come with stories emphasizing the character&#x27;s insanity. In &quot;The Laughing Fish&quot;, the Joker disfigures fish with a rictus grin resembling his own (expecting copyright protection), and is unable to understand that copyrighting a natural resource is legally impossible. Englehart&#x27;s and Rogers&#x27; work on the series influenced the 1989 film &quot;Batman&quot;, and was adapted for 1992&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Rogers expanded on Adams&#x27; character design, drawing the Joker with a fedora and trench coat. Englehart outlined how he understood the character by saying that the Joker &quot;was this very crazy, scary character. I really wanted to get back to the idea of Batman fighting insane murderers at 3 a.m. under the full moon, as the clouds scuttled by.&quot;

===Modern Age===
Years after the end of the 1966 television series, sales of &quot;Batman&quot; continued to fall and the title was nearly cancelled. Although the 1970s restored the Joker as Batman&#x27;s insane, lethal archenemy, it was during the 1980s that the &quot;Batman&quot; series started to turn around and the Joker came into his own as part of the &quot;Dark Age&quot; of comics, with mature tales of death and destruction. The shift was criticized for moving away from tamer superheroes (and villains), but comic audiences were no longer primarily children. Several months after &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; launched the era by killing off Silver Age icons such as the Flash and Supergirl and undoing decades of continuity, Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; (1986) re-imagined Batman as an older, retired hero and the Joker as a lipstick-wearing celebrity who cannot function without his foe. The late 1980s saw the Joker exert a significant impact on Batman and his supporting cast. In the 1988–89 story arc &quot;&quot;, the Joker murders Batman&#x27;s sidekick (the second Robin, Jason Todd). Todd was unpopular with fans; rather than modify his character, DC opted to let them vote for his fate and a 72-vote plurality had the Joker brutally beat Todd with a crowbar and trap him in a room with a bomb, killing him. This story altered the Batman universe: instead of killing anonymous bystanders, the Joker murdered a core character; this had a lasting effect on future stories. Written at the height of tensions between the United States and Iran, the story&#x27;s conclusion had Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini appoint the Joker his country&#x27;s ambassador to the United Nations (allowing him to temporarily escape justice).

Alan Moore and Brian Bolland&#x27;s 1988 graphic novel &quot;&quot; expands on the Joker&#x27;s origins, describing the character as a failed comedian who adopts the identity of the Red Hood to support his pregnant wife. Unlike &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; takes place in mainstream continuity. The novel is described by critics as one of the greatest Joker stories ever written, influencing later comic stories (including the forced retirement of then-Batgirl, Barbara Gordon, after she is paralyzed by the Joker) and films such as 1989&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; and 2008&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. Grant Morrison&#x27;s 1989 &quot;Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth&quot; explores the psychoses of Batman, the Joker and other rogues in the eponymous facility.

The 1992 animated series introduced the Joker&#x27;s female sidekick: Harley Quinn, a psychiatrist who falls for—and ends up in an abusive relationship with—the Joker, becoming his supervillain accomplice. The character was popular, and was adapted into the comics as the Joker&#x27;s romantic interest in 1999. In the same year, Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle&#x27;s comic book &quot;Anarky&quot; concluded with the revelation that the titular character was the Joker&#x27;s son. Breyfogle conceived the idea as a means to expand on Anarky&#x27;s characterization, but O&#x27;Neil (by then the editor for the &quot;Batman&quot; series of books) was opposed to it, and only allowed it to be written under protest, and with a promise that the revelation would eventually be revealed incorrect. However, the &quot;Anarky&quot; series was cancelled before the rebuttal could be published. The Joker&#x27;s first major storyline in The New 52, DC Comics&#x27; 2011 reboot of story continuity, was 2012&#x27;s &quot;Death of the Family&quot; by writer Scott Snyder and artist Greg Capullo. The story arc explores the symbiotic relationship between the Joker and Batman, and sees the villain shatter the trust between Batman and his adopted family. Capullo&#x27;s Joker design replaced his traditional outfit with a utilitarian, messy, and disheveled appearance to convey that the character was on a mission; his face (surgically removed in 2011&#x27;s &quot;Detective Comics&quot; (vol. 2) #1) was reattached with belts, wires, and hooks, and he was outfitted with mechanics overalls. The Joker&#x27;s face was restored in Snyder&#x27;s and Capullo&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2014), the concluding chapter to &quot;Death of the Family&quot;.

The conclusion of the 2020 &quot;Joker War&quot; storyline by writer James Tynion IV and artist Jorge Jiménez sees the Joker leave Gotham after Batman chooses to let him die. This led to a second ongoing &quot;Joker&quot; series, beginning in March 2021 with Tynion writing and Guillem March providing art.

==Character biography==
The Joker has undergone many revisions since his 1940 debut. The most common interpretation of the character is that of a man who, while disguised as the criminal Red Hood, is pursued by Batman and falls into a vat of chemicals that bleaches his skin, colors his hair green and his lips red, and drives him insane. The reasons why the Joker was disguised as the Red Hood and his identity before his transformation have changed over time.

The character was introduced in &quot;Batman&quot; #1 (1940), in which he announces that he will kill three of Gotham&#x27;s prominent citizens. Although the police protect his first announced victim, millionaire Henry Claridge, the Joker had poisoned him before making his announcement and Claridge dies with a ghastly grin on his face. Batman eventually defeats him, sending him to prison. The Joker commits crimes ranging from whimsical to brutal, for reasons that, in Batman&#x27;s words, &quot;make sense to him alone&quot;. &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #168 (1951) introduced the Joker&#x27;s first origin story as the former Red Hood: a masked criminal who, during his final heist, vanished after leaping into a vat of chemicals to escape Batman. His resulting disfigurement drove him insane and led him to adopt the name &quot;Joker&quot;, from the playing card figure he came to resemble. The Joker&#x27;s Silver Age transformation into a figure of fun was established in 1952&#x27;s &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Millions&quot;. In this story, the Joker is obsessed with maintaining his illusion of wealth and celebrity as a criminal folk hero, afraid to let Gotham&#x27;s citizens know that he is penniless and was tricked out of his fortune. The 1970s redefined the character as a homicidal sociopath. &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Five-Way Revenge&quot; has the Joker taking violent revenge on the former gang members who betrayed him, while &quot;The Laughing Fish&quot; portrays him chemically disfiguring fish so they will share his trademark grin, hoping to profit from a copyright, and killing bureaucrats who stand in his way.
&quot;Batman: The Killing Joke&quot; (1988) built on the Joker&#x27;s 1951 origin story, portraying him as a failed comedian who participates in a robbery as the Red Hood to support his pregnant wife. Batman arrives to stop the robbery, provoking the terrified comedian into jumping into a vat of chemicals, which dyes his skin chalk-white, his hair green, and his lips bright red. His disfigurement, combined with the trauma of his wife&#x27;s earlier accidental death, drives him insane, and results in the birth of the Joker. However, the Joker says that this story may not be true; he admits that he does not remember exactly what drove him insane, and says that he prefers his past to be &quot;multiple choice&quot;. In this graphic novel, the Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara Gordon, the former Batgirl, and tortures her father, Commissioner James &quot;Jim&quot; Gordon, to prove that it only takes &quot;one bad day&quot; to drive a normal man insane. After Batman rescues Gordon and subdues the Joker, he offers to rehabilitate his old foe and end their rivalry. Although the Joker refuses, he shows his appreciation by sharing a joke with Batman. Following the character&#x27;s maiming of Barbara, she became a more important character in the DC Universe: the Oracle, a data gatherer and superhero informant, who has her revenge in &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; by shattering the Joker&#x27;s teeth and destroying his smile.

In the 1988 story &quot;A Death in the Family&quot;, the Joker beats Jason Todd, the second Robin, with a crowbar and leaves him to die in an explosion. Todd&#x27;s death haunts Batman, and for the first time he seriously considers killing the Joker. The Joker temporarily escapes justice when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini appoints him the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, giving him diplomatic immunity; however, when he tries to poison the U.N. membership, he is defeated by Batman and Superman.

In the 1999 &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; storyline, the Joker murders Commissioner Gordon&#x27;s second wife, Sarah, as she shields a group of infants. He taunts Gordon, who shoots him in the kneecap. The Joker, lamenting that he may never walk again, collapses with laughter when he realizes that the commissioner has avenged Barbara&#x27;s paralysis.

The 2000s began with the crossover story &quot;Emperor Joker&quot;, in which the Joker steals Mister Mxyzptlk&#x27;s reality-altering power and remakes the universe in his image (torturing and killing Batman daily, before resurrecting him). When the supervillain then tries to destroy the universe, his reluctance to eliminate Batman makes him lose control, and Superman defeats him. Broken by his experience, Batman&#x27;s experiences of death are transferred to Superman by the Spectre so he can heal mentally. In &quot;Joker: Last Laugh&quot; (2001), the doctors at Arkham Asylum convince the character that he is dying in an attempt to rehabilitate him. Instead, the Joker (flanked by an army of &quot;Jokerized&quot; supervillains) launches a final crime spree. Believing that Robin (Tim Drake) has been killed in the chaos, Dick Grayson beats the Joker to death (although Batman revives his foe to keep Grayson from becoming a murderer), and the villain succeeds in making a member of the Bat-family break their rule against killing.

In &quot;&quot; (2005), a resurrected Todd tries to force Batman to avenge his death by killing the Joker. Batman refuses, arguing that if he allowed himself to kill the Joker, he would not be able to stop himself from killing other criminals. The Joker kills Alexander Luthor, Jr. in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; (2005) for excluding him from the Secret Society of Super Villains, which considers him too unpredictable for membership. In Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Batman and Son&quot; (2006), a deranged police officer who impersonates Batman shoots the Joker in the face, scarring and disabling him. The supervillain returns in &quot;The Clown at Midnight&quot; (2007) as an enigmatic force who awakens and tries to kill Harley Quinn to prove to Batman that he has become more than human. In the 2008 story arc &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; the Joker is recruited by the Black Glove to destroy Batman, but betrays the group, killing its members one by one. After Batman&#x27;s apparent death in &quot;Final Crisis&quot; (2008), Grayson investigates a series of murders (which leads him to a disguised Joker). The Joker is arrested, and then-Robin Damian Wayne beats him with a crowbar, paralleling Todd&#x27;s murder. When the Joker escapes, he attacks the Black Glove, burying its leader Simon Hurt alive after the supervillain considers him a failure as an opponent; the Joker is then defeated by the recently returned Batman.

In DC&#x27;s The New 52, a 2011 relaunch of its titles following &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, the Joker has his own face cut off. He disappears for a year, returning to launch an attack on Batman&#x27;s extended family in &quot;Death of the Family&quot; so he and Batman can be the best hero and villain they can be. At the end of the storyline, the Joker falls off a cliff into a dark abyss. The Joker returns in the 2014 storyline &quot;Endgame&quot; in which he brainwashes the Justice League into attacking Batman, believing he has betrayed their relationship. The story implies that the Joker is immortal—having existed for centuries in Gotham as a cause of tragedy after exposure to a substance the Joker terms &quot;dionesium&quot;—and is able to regenerate from mortal injuries. &quot;Endgame&quot; restores the Joker&#x27;s face, and also reveals that he knows Batman&#x27;s secret identity. The story ends with the apparent deaths of Batman and the Joker at each other&#x27;s hands, though it is revealed that they were both resurrected in a life-restoring Lazarus Pit, without their memories.
During the &quot;Darkseid War&quot; (2015–2016) storyline, Batman uses Metron&#x27;s Mobius Chair to find out the Joker&#x27;s real name; the chair&#x27;s answer leaves Batman in disbelief. In the &quot;DC Universe: Rebirth&quot; (2016) one-shot, Batman informs Hal Jordan that the chair told him there were three individual Jokers, not just one. This revelation was the basis for the miniseries &quot;&quot; (2020), written by Geoff Johns with art by Jason Fabok. &quot;Three Jokers&quot; reveals that the three Jokers, who work in tandem, include &quot;The Criminal&quot;, a methodical mastermind based on the Golden Age Joker; &quot;The Clown&quot;, a goofy prankster based on the Silver Age Joker; and &quot;The Comedian&quot;, a sadistic psychopath based on the Modern Age Joker. The Comedian orchestrates the deaths of the other two Jokers and reveals himself as the original. The miniseries ends with the revelation that Batman knows the Joker&#x27;s true identity.

===Origins===
Although a number of backstories have been given, a definitive one has never been established for the Joker. An unreliable narrator, the character is uncertain of who he was before and how he became the Joker: &quot;Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another ...if I&#x27;m going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!&quot; A story about the Joker&#x27;s origin appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #168 (February 1951), more than decade after the character&#x27;s debut. Here, the character is a laboratory worker who becomes the Red Hood (a masked criminal) to steal $1 million and retire. He falls into a vat of chemical waste when his heist is thwarted by Batman, emerging with bleached white skin, red lips, green hair and a permanent grin.

This story was the basis for the most often-cited origin tale, Moore&#x27;s one-shot &quot;The Killing Joke&quot;. The man who will become the Joker quits his job as a lab assistant in order to fulfill his dream of being a stand-up comedian, only to fail miserably. Desperate to support his pregnant wife, he agrees to help two criminals commit a robbery as the Red Hood. The heist goes awry; the comedian leaps into a chemical vat to escape Batman, surfacing disfigured. This, combined with the earlier accidental death of his wife and unborn child, drives the comedian insane, turning him into the Joker. This version has been cited in many stories, including &quot;&quot; (in which Batman deduces that the Red Hood survived his fall and became the Joker), &quot;Batman&quot; #450 (in which the Joker dons the Red Hood to aid his recovery after the events in &quot;A Death in the Family&quot;, but finds the experience too traumatic), &quot;&quot; #38 (in which Joker&#x27;s failed stand-up performance is shown), &quot;Death of the Family&quot;, and &quot;Batman: Three Jokers&quot; (which asserts that it is the canon origin story). Other stories have expanded on this origin; &quot;&quot; suggests that the Joker&#x27;s wife was murdered by a corrupt policeman working for the mobsters, and &quot;Payback&quot; gives the Joker&#x27;s first name as &quot;Jack&quot;. The ending of &quot;Batman: Three Jokers&quot; establishes that the Joker&#x27;s wife did not actually die—rather, she fled to Alaska with the help of Gotham police and Batman because she feared her husband would be an abusive father; the police then told the Joker a story about her dying to protect her. The miniseries also reveals that Batman knows the Joker&#x27;s identity, and has kept it secret in order to protect the criminal&#x27;s wife and son.

However, the Joker&#x27;s unreliable memory has allowed writers to develop other origins for the character. &quot;Case Study&quot;, a Paul Dini-Alex Ross story, describes the Joker as a sadistic gangster who creates the Red Hood identity because he misses the thrill of committing robberies. He has his fateful first meeting with Batman, which results in his disfigurement. It is suggested that the Joker is sane, and researches his crimes to &quot;look like&quot; the work of a sick mind in order to avoid the death penalty. In &quot;Batman Confidential&quot; #7–12, the character Jack is a career criminal who is bored with his work. He encounters (and becomes obsessed with) Batman during a heist, embarking on a crime spree to attract the Caped Crusader&#x27;s attention. After Jack injures Batman&#x27;s girlfriend, Batman scars Jack&#x27;s face with a permanent grin and betrays him to a group of mobsters, who torture him in a chemical plant. Jack escapes but falls into an empty vat as gunfire punctures chemical tanks above him. The flood of chemicals (used in anti-psychotic medication) alters his appearance and completes his transformation. In &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #31, the superhero Atom enters the Joker&#x27;s mind and sees the criminal&#x27;s former self - a violent sociopath who tortures animals, murders his own parents, and kills for fun while committing robberies. Snyder&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2013) suggests that the pre-disfigured Joker was a criminal mastermind leading a gang of Red Hoods.

===Alternative versions===
A number of alternate universes in DC Comics publications have allowed writers to introduce variations on the Joker, in which the character&#x27;s origins, behavior, and morality differ from the mainstream setting. &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; depicts the final battle between an aged Batman and Joker; others portray the aftermath of the Joker&#x27;s death at the hands of a number of characters, including Superman. Still others describe distant futures in which the Joker is a computer virus or a hero trying to defeat the era&#x27;s tyrannical Batman. In some stories, the Joker is someone else entirely: In &quot;&quot; (1993), Lex Luthor becomes the Joker in a world where Superman is Batman; &quot;Flashpoint&quot; (2011) portrays Batman&#x27;s mother, Martha Wayne, becoming the Joker after being driven mad by her son&#x27;s murder; and in &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot; (2017), Batman is infected by a toxin after killing the Joker, which turns him into the supervillain, The Batman Who Laughs, a combination of Batman&#x27;s and the Joker&#x27;s personalities.

Renowned as Batman&#x27;s greatest enemy, the Joker is known by a number of nicknames, including the Clown Prince of Crime, the Harlequin of Hate, the Ace of Knaves, and the Jester of Genocide. During the evolution of the DC Universe, interpretations and versions of the Joker have taken two main forms. The original, dominant image is that of a psychopath with genius-level intelligence and a warped, sadistic sense of humor. The other version, popular in comic books from the late 1940s to the 1960s and in the 1960s television series, is an eccentric, harmless prankster and thief. Like other long-lived characters, the Joker&#x27;s character and cultural interpretations have changed with time; however, unlike other characters who may need to reconcile or ignore previous versions to make sense, more than any other comic book character, the Joker thrives on his mutable and irreconcilable identities. The Joker is typically seen in a purple suit with a long-tailed, padded-shoulder jacket, a string tie, gloves, striped pants and spats on pointed-toe shoes (sometimes with a wide-brimmed hat). This appearance is such a fundamental aspect of the character that when the 2004 animated series &quot;The Batman&quot; placed the Joker in a straitjacket, it quickly redesigned him in his familiar suit.

The Joker is obsessed with Batman, the pair representing a yin-yang of opposing dark and light force, although it is the Joker who represents humor and color and Batman who dwells in the dark. No crime – including murder, theft, and terrorism – is beyond the Joker, and his exploits are theatrical performances that are funny to him alone. Spectacle is more important than success for the Joker, and if it is not spectacular it is boring. Although the Joker claims indifference to everything, he secretly craves Batman&#x27;s attention and validation. The character was described as having killed over 2,000 people in &quot;The Joker: Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; (1996). Despite this body count, he is always found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent to Arkham Asylum, avoiding the death penalty. Many of the Joker&#x27;s acts attempt to force Batman to kill; to the Joker, the greatest victory would be to make Batman become like him. The Joker displays no instinct for self-preservation, and is willing to die to prove his point that anyone could become like him after &quot;one bad day&quot;. The Joker is the &quot;personification of the irrational,&quot; and represents &quot;everything Batman [opposes].&quot;

===Personality===

The Joker&#x27;s main characteristic is his apparent insanity, although he is not described as having any particular psychological disorder. Like a psychopath, he lacks empathy, a conscience, and concern over right and wrong. In &quot;Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth&quot;, the Joker is described as capable of processing outside sensory information only by adapting to it. This enables him to create a new personality every day (depending on what would benefit him) and explains why, at different times, he is a mischievous clown or a psychopathic killer. In &quot;The Clown at Midnight&quot; (&quot;Batman&quot; #663 (April 2007)), the Joker enters a meditative state where he evaluates his previous selves to consciously create a new personality, effectively modifying himself for his needs.

&quot;The Killing Joke&quot; (in which the Joker is the unreliable narrator) explains the roots of his insanity as &quot;one bad day&quot;: losing his wife and unborn child and being disfigured by chemicals, paralleling Batman&#x27;s origin in the loss of his parents. He tries (and fails) to prove that anyone can become like him after one bad day by torturing Commissioner Gordon, physically and psychologically. Batman offers to rehabilitate his foe; the Joker apologetically declines, believing it too late for him to be saved. Other interpretations show that the Joker is fully aware of how his actions affect others and that his insanity as merely an act. Comics scholar Peter Coogan describes the Joker as trying to reshape reality to fit himself by imposing his face on his victims (and fish) in an attempt to make the world comprehensible by creating a twisted parody of himself. Englehart&#x27;s &quot;The Laughing Fish&quot; demonstrates the character&#x27;s illogical nature: trying to copyright fish that bear his face, and not understanding why threatening the copyright clerk cannot produce the desired result.

The Joker is alternatively depicted as sexual and asexual. In &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; and &quot;Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth&quot;, the Joker is seductive toward Batman; it is uncertain if their relationship has homoerotic undertones or if the Joker is simply trying to manipulate his nemesis. Frank Miller interpreted the character as fixated on death and uninterested in sexual relationships, while Robinson believed that the Joker is capable of a romantic relationship. His relationship with Harley Quinn is abusively paradoxical; although the Joker keeps her at his side, he heedlessly harms her (for example, throwing her out a window without seeing if she survives). Harley loves him, but the Joker does not reciprocate her feelings, chiding her for distracting him from other plans.

Snyder&#x27;s &quot;Death of the Family&quot; describes the Joker as in love with Batman, although not in a traditionally romantic way. The Joker believes that Batman has not killed him because he makes Batman better and he loves the villain for that. &quot;Batman&quot; comic book writer Peter Tomasi concurred, stating that the Joker&#x27;s main goal is to make Batman the best that he can be. The Joker and Batman represent opposites: the extroverted Joker wears colorful clothing and embraces chaos, while the introverted, monochromatic Batman represents order and discipline. The Joker is often depicted as defining his existence through his conflict with Batman. In 1994&#x27;s &quot;Going Sane&quot;, the villain tries to lead a normal life after Batman&#x27;s (apparent) death, only to become his old self again when Batman reappears; in &quot;Emperor Joker&quot;, an apparently omnipotent Joker cannot destroy Batman without undoing himself. Since the Joker is simply &quot;the Joker&quot;, he believes that Batman is &quot;Batman&quot; (with or without the costume) and has no interest in what is behind Batman&#x27;s mask, ignoring opportunities to learn Batman&#x27;s secret identity. Given the opportunity to kill Batman, the villain demurs; he believes that without their game, winning is pointless. The character has no desire for typical criminal goals like money or power; his criminality is designed only to continue his game with Batman.

The Joker is portrayed as having no fear; when fellow supervillain Scarecrow doses him with fear toxin in &quot;&quot; (1993), the Joker merely laughs and says &quot;Boo!&quot; The villain has been temporarily rendered sane by several means, including telepathic manipulation by the Martian Manhunter and being resurrected in a Lazarus Pit (an experience typically inducing temporary insanity in the subject). At these moments, the Joker is depicted as expressing remorse for his crimes; however, during a medically induced period of partial sanity in &quot;&quot;, he tells Batman, &quot;I don&#x27;t hate you &#x27;cause I&#x27;m crazy. I&#x27;m crazy &#x27;cause I hate you,&quot; and confirms that he will only stop killing when Batman is dead.

===Skills and equipment===

The Joker has no inherent superhuman abilities. He commits crimes with a variety of weaponized thematic props such as a deck of razor-tipped playing cards, rolling marbles, jack-in-the-boxes with unpleasant surprises and exploding cigars capable of leveling a building. The flower in his lapel sprays acid, and his hand often holds a lethal joy buzzer conducting a million volts of electricity, although both items were introduced in 1952 as harmless joke items. However, his chemical genius provides his most-notable weapon: &quot;Joker venom&quot;, a liquid or gaseous toxin that sends its targets into fits of uncontrollable laughter; higher doses can lead to paralysis, coma or death, leaving its victim with a ghoulish, pained rictus grin. The Joker has used venom since his debut; only he knows the formula, and is shown to be gifted enough to manufacture the toxin from ordinary household chemicals. Another version of the venom (used in &quot;Joker: Last Laugh&quot;) makes its victims resemble the Joker, susceptible to his orders. The villain is immune to venom and most poisons; in &quot;Batman&quot; #663 (April 2007), Morrison writes that being &quot;an avid consumer of his own chemical experiments, the Joker&#x27;s immunity to poison concoctions that might kill another man in an instant has been developed over years of dedicated abuse.&quot;

The character&#x27;s arsenal is inspired by his nemesis&#x27; weaponry, such as batarangs. In &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Utility Belt&quot; (1952), he mimicked Batman&#x27;s utility belt with non-lethal items, such as Mexican jumping beans and sneezing powder. In 1942&#x27;s &quot;The Joker Follows Suit&quot;, the villain built his versions of the Batplane and Batmobile, the Jokergyro and Jokermobile (the latter with a large Joker face on its hood), and created a Joker-signal with which criminals could summon him for their heists. The Jokermobile lasted for several decades, evolving with the Batmobile. His technical genius is not limited by practicality, allowing him to hijack Gotham&#x27;s television airwaves to issue threats, transform buildings into death traps, launch a gas attack on the city and rain poisoned glass shards on its citizens from an airship.

The Joker is portrayed as skilled in melee combat, from his initial appearances when he defeats Batman in a sword fight (nearly killing him), and others when he overwhelms Batman but declines to kill him. He is talented with firearms, although even his guns are theatrical; his long-barreled revolver often releases a flag reading &quot;Bang&quot;, and a second trigger-pull launches the flag to skewer its target. Although formidable in combat, the Joker&#x27;s chief asset is his mind.

===Relationships===

The Joker&#x27;s unpredictable, homicidal nature makes him one of the most feared supervillains in the DC Universe; the Trickster says in the 1995 miniseries &quot;Underworld Unleashed&quot;, &quot;When super-villains want to scare each other, they tell Joker stories.&quot; Gotham&#x27;s villains also feel threatened by the character; depending on the circumstances, he is as likely to fight with his rivals for control of the city as he is to join them for an entertaining outcome. The Joker interacts with other supervillains who oppose Batman, whether he is on the streets or in Arkham Asylum. He has collaborated with criminals like the Penguin, the Riddler, and Two-Face, although these partnerships rarely end well due to the Joker&#x27;s desire for unbridled chaos, and he uses his stature to lead others (such as Killer Croc and the Scarecrow). The Joker&#x27;s greatest rival is Lex Luthor, the smartest man in the world and Superman&#x27;s archenemy. Although the villains have a friendly partnership in 1950&#x27;s &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #88, later unions emphasized their mutual hostility and clashing egos.

Despite his tendency to kill subordinates on a whim, the Joker has no difficulty attracting henchmen with a seemingly infinite cash supply and intimidation; they are too afraid of their employer to refuse his demands that they wear red clown noses or laugh at his macabre jokes. Even with his unpredictability and lack of superhuman powers, the 2007 limited series &quot;Salvation Run&quot; sees hundreds of villains fall under his spell because they are more afraid of him than Lex Luthor. &quot;Batman&quot; #186 (1966) introduced the Joker&#x27;s first sidekick: the one-shot character Gaggy Gagsworthy, who is short and dressed like a clown; the character was later resurrected as an enemy of his replacement, Harley Quinn. Introduced in the 1992 animated series, Quinn is the Joker&#x27;s former Arkham psychiatrist who develops an obsessive infatuation with him and dons a red-and-black harlequin costume to join him as his sidekick and on-off girlfriend. They have a classic abusive relationship; even though the Joker constantly insults, hurts, and even tries to kill Harley, she always returns to him, convinced that he loves her. The Joker is sometimes shown to keep laughing hyenas as pets; this trait was introduced in the 1977 animated series &quot;The New Adventures of Batman&quot;. A 1976 issue of &quot;Batman Family&quot; introduced Duela Dent as the Joker&#x27;s daughter, though her parentage claim was later proven to be false.

Although his chief obsession is Batman, the character has occasionally ventured outside Gotham City to fight Batman&#x27;s superhero allies. In &quot;To Laugh and Die in Metropolis&quot; (1987) the character kidnaps Lois Lane, distracting Superman with a nuclear weapon. The story is notable for the Joker taking on a (relative) god and the ease with which Superman defeats him—it took only 17 pages. Asked why he came to Metropolis, the Joker replies simply: &quot;Oh Superman, why not?&quot; In 1995, the Joker fought his third major DC hero: Wonder Woman, who drew on the Greek god of trickery to temper the Joker&#x27;s humor and shatter his confidence. The character has joined supervillain groups like the Injustice Gang and the Injustice League to take on superhero groups like the Justice League.

==Literary analysis==

Since the Bronze Age of Comics, the Joker has been interpreted as an archetypal trickster, displaying talents for cunning intelligence, social engineering, pranks, theatricality, and idiomatic humor. Like the trickster, the Joker alternates between malicious violence and clever, harmless whimsy. He is amoral and not driven by ethical considerations, but by a shameless and insatiable nature, and although his actions are condemned as evil, he is necessary for cultural robustness. The trickster employs amoral and immoral acts to destabilize the status quo and reveal cultural, political, and ethical hypocrisies that society attempts to ignore. However, the Joker differs in that his actions typically only benefit himself. The Joker possesses abnormal body imagery, reflecting an inversion of order. The trickster is simultaneously subhuman and superhuman, a being that indicates a lack of unity in body and mind. In &quot;Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth&quot;, the Joker serves as Batman&#x27;s trickster guide through the hero&#x27;s own psyche, testing him in various ways before ultimately offering to cede his rule of the Asylum to Batman.

Rather than the typical anarchist interpretation, others have analysed the character as a Marxist (opposite to Batman&#x27;s capitalist), arguing that anarchism requires the rejection of all authority in favor of uncontrolled freedom. The Joker rejects most authority, but retains his own, using his actions to coerce and consolidate power in himself and convert the masses to his own way of thinking, while eliminating any that oppose him. In &quot;The Killing Joke&quot;, the Joker is an abused member of the underclass who is driven insane by failings of the social system. The Joker rejects material needs, and his first appearance in &quot;Batman&quot; #1 sees him perpetrate crimes against Gotham&#x27;s wealthiest men and the judge who had sent him to prison. Batman is wealthy, yet the Joker is able to triumph through his own innovations.

Ryan Litsey described the Joker as an example of a &quot;Nietzschean Superman,&quot; arguing that a fundamental aspect of Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s Superman, the &quot;will to power,&quot; is exemplified in all of the Joker&#x27;s actions, providing a master morality to Batman&#x27;s slave morality. The character&#x27;s indomitable &quot;will to power&quot; means he is never discouraged by being caught or defeated and he is not restrained by guilt or remorse. Joker represents the master, who creates rules and defines them, who judges others without needing approval, and for whom something is good because it benefits him. He creates his own morality and is bound only by his own rules without aspiring to something higher than himself, unlike Batman, the slave, who makes a distinction between good and evil, and is bound to rules outside of himself (such as his avoidance of killing) in his quest for justice. The Joker has no defined origin story that requires him to question how he came to be, as like the Superman he does not regret or assess the past and only moves forward.

The Joker&#x27;s controlling and abusive relationship with Harley Quinn has been analyzed as a means of the Joker reinforcing his own belief in his power in a world where he may be killed or neutralized by another villain or Batman. Joker mirrors his identity through Harley in her appearance, and even though he may ignore or act indifferent towards her, he continues to try to subject her to his control. When Harley successfully defeats Batman in &quot;Mad Love&quot; (1994), the Joker, emasculated by his own failure, severely injures her out of fear of what the other villains will think of him; however, while Harley recovers, the Joker sends her flowers, which she accepts, reasserting his control over her.

Harley&#x27;s co-creator, Paul Dini, describes their relationship as Harley being someone who makes the Joker feel better about himself, and who can do the work that he does not want to do himself. In the 1999 one-shot comic &quot;Batman: Harley Quinn&quot;, the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting that he does care for her, that their relationship is romantic, and that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose. Removing the traditional male-female relationship, such as in the &quot;Batman: Thrillkiller&quot; storyline where the Joker (Bianca Steeplechase) is a female and involved in a lesbian relationship with Harley, their relationship lacks any aspects of violence or subjugation.

==Legacy==

The Joker is considered one of the most recognizable and iconic fictional characters in popular culture, one of the best comic villains, and one of the greatest villains of all time. The character was well-liked following his debut, appearing in nine out of the first 12 &quot;Batman&quot; issues, and remained one of Batman&#x27;s most popular foes throughout his publication. The character is considered one of the four top comic book characters, alongside Batman, Superman, and Spider-Man. Indeed, when DC Comics released the original series of &quot;Greatest Stories Ever Told&quot; (1987–1988) featuring collections of stories about heroes like Batman and Superman, the Joker was the only villain included alongside them. The character has been the focus of ethical discussion on the desirability of Batman (who adheres to an unbreakable code forbidding killing) saving lives by murdering the Joker (a relentless dealer of death). These debates weigh the positive (stopping the Joker permanently) against its effect on Batman&#x27;s character and the possibility that he might begin killing all criminals.

In 2006, the Joker was number one on &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Villains of All Time.&quot; In 2008 &quot;Wizard&quot;″s list of &quot;200 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time&quot; placed the Joker fifth, and the character was eighth on &quot;Empire&quot;″s list of &quot;50 Greatest Comic Book Characters&quot; (the highest-ranked villain on both lists). In 2009, the Joker was second on &quot;IGN&quot;″s list of &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Villains,&quot; and in 2011, &quot;Wired&quot; named him &quot;Comics&#x27; Greatest Supervillain.&quot; &quot;Complex&quot;, &quot;CollegeHumor&quot;, and &quot;WhatCulture&quot; named the Joker the greatest comic book villain of all time while &quot;IGN&quot; listed him the top DC Comics villain in 2013, and &quot;Newsarama&quot; as the greatest Batman villain.

The Joker&#x27;s popularity (and his role as Batman&#x27;s enemy) has involved the character in most &quot;Batman&quot;-related media, from television to video games. These adaptations of the character have been received positively on film, television, and in video games. As in the comics, the character&#x27;s personality and appearance shift; he is campy, ferocious or unstable, depending on the author and the intended audience.

The character inspired theme-park roller coasters (such as The Joker&#x27;s Jinx, The Joker in Mexico and California, and The Joker Chaos Coaster), and featured in story-based rides such as Justice League: Battle for Metropolis. The Joker is one of the few comic book supervillains to be represented on children&#x27;s merchandise and toys, appearing on items including action figures, trading cards, board games, money boxes, pajamas, socks, and shoes. The Jokermobile was a popular toy; a Corgi die-cast metal replica was successful during the 1950s, and in the 1970s a Joker-styled, flower power-era Volkswagen microbus was manufactured by Mego. In 2015, &quot;The Joker: A Serious Study of the Clown Prince of Crime&quot; became the first academic book to be published about a supervillain.

=== Online phenomena ===

The Joker has inspired a large number of internet memes, often stemming from the character&#x27;s portrayal in films. According to Steven T. Wright of &quot;The Outline&quot;, the character &quot;came to symbolize the archetype of the &#x27;edgelord,&#x27; a vapid, self-styled provocateur who prides himself in his ability to &#x27;trigger&#x27; those who hold progressive viewpoints.&quot;

The phrase &quot;We live in a society&quot; is commonly associated with the Joker in memes, especially after the release of the trailers of the 2019 film &quot;Joker&quot;. The line garnered particular notoriety after a trailer for the film &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot; (2021) featured Joker saying the line.

The Joker is often featured as part of the &quot;Gang Weed&quot; meme, a satirical take on incels, &quot;neckbeards&quot; and &quot;nice guys&quot;, as well as cannabis and gamer culture.

===In other media===
The Joker has appeared in a variety of media, including television series, animated and live-action films. WorldCat (a catalog of libraries in 170 countries) records over 250 productions featuring the Joker as a subject, including films, books, and video games, and Batman films which feature the character are typically the most successful. The character&#x27;s earliest on-screen adaptation was in the 1966 television series &quot;Batman&quot; and its film adaptation &quot;Batman&quot;, in which he was played as a cackling prankster by Cesar Romero (reflecting his contemporary comic counterpart). The Joker then appeared in the animated television series &quot;The Adventures of Batman&quot; (1968, voiced by Ted Knight), &quot;The New Adventures of Batman&quot; (1977, voiced by Lennie Weinrib) and &quot;The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians&quot; (1985, voiced by Frank Welker).

A version of the Joker named Jack Napier (played by Jack Nicholson) made his film debut in 1989&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot;, which earned over $400 million at the worldwide box office. The role was a defining performance in Nicholson&#x27;s career and was considered to overshadow Batman&#x27;s, with film critic Roger Ebert saying that the audience must sometimes remind themselves not to root for the Joker. &quot;Batman&quot;″s success led to the 1992 television series, &quot;&quot;. Voiced by Mark Hamill, the Joker retained the darker tone of the comics in stories acceptable for young children. Hamill&#x27;s Joker is considered a defining portrayal, and he voiced the character in spin-off films (1993&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and 2000&#x27;s &quot;Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker&quot;), video games (2001&#x27;s &quot;&quot;), related series (1996&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Static Shock&quot; and 2001&#x27;s &quot;Justice League&quot;), action figures, toys and amusement-park voiceovers. A redesigned Joker, voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson, appeared in 2004&#x27;s &quot;The Batman&quot;; Richardson was the first African-American to play the character.

After Christopher Nolan&#x27;s successful 2005 &quot;Batman&quot; film reboot, &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, which ended with a teaser for the Joker&#x27;s involvement in a sequel, the character appeared in 2008&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, played by Heath Ledger as an avatar of anarchy and chaos. While &quot;Batman Begins&quot; earned a worldwide total of $370 million; &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; earned over $1 billion and was the highest-grossing film of the year, setting several contemporary box-office records (including highest-grossing midnight opening, opening day and opening weekend). Ledger won a posthumous Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance, the first acting Oscar ever won for a superhero film. The Joker has featured in a number of animated projects, such as 2009&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (voiced by Jeff Bennett) and 2011&#x27;s &quot;Young Justice&quot; (voiced by Brent Spiner). In comic book adaptations, the character has been voiced by John DiMaggio in 2010&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and 2020&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, and by Michael Emerson in 2012&#x27;s two-parter &quot;&quot;.

The television series &quot;Gotham&quot; (2014–2019) explores the mythology of the Joker through twin brothers Jerome and Jeremiah Valeska, played by Cameron Monaghan. Jared Leto portrayed the Joker in the DC Extended Universe, beginning with &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (2016); Leto reprised the role in &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot; (2021). Zach Galifianakis voiced the character in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; (2017). Todd Phillips&#x27; 2019 film &quot;Joker&quot; provided an alternative origin story for the character, and starred Joaquin Phoenix as aspiring stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck. Although the film was controversial for its violence and portrayal of mental illness, Phoenix&#x27;s performance received widespread acclaim. Like &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; before it, &quot;Joker&quot; grossed over $1billion at the box office, breaking contemporary financial records, and earned numerous awards including an Academy Award for Best Actor for Phoenix. Barry Keoghan makes a cameo appearance as the Joker in Matt Reeves&#x27; film &quot;The Batman&quot; (2022), where he is credited as &quot;Unseen Arkham Prisoner&quot;.

The Joker has also been featured in video games. Hamill returned to voice the character in 2009&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;&quot;, its equally praised 2011 sequel &quot;&quot; and the multiplayer &quot;DC Universe Online&quot;. Hamill was replaced by Troy Baker for the 2013 prequel, &quot;&quot;, and the &quot;Arkham&quot; series&#x27; animated &quot;&quot;, while Hamill returned for the 2015 series finale, &quot;&quot;. Richard Epcar has voiced the Joker in a series of fighting games including, &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot; (2008), &quot;&quot; (2013), its sequel &quot;Injustice 2&quot; (2017), and &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; (2019). The character also appeared in &quot;Lego Batman: The Videogame&quot; (2008), &quot;Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes&quot; (2012) and its animated adaptation, and &quot;Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham&quot; (2014) (the latter three voiced by Christopher Corey Smith), as well as &quot;Lego DC Super-Villains&quot; (2018), with the role reprised by Hamill. Anthony Ingruber voices the Joker in &quot;&quot; (2016) and its sequel &quot;&quot; (2017).

<text>Hemen is a falcon god in the Ancient Egyptian religion

==Places of worship==
Often worshipped as a divine entity unified with Horus, as Horus-Hemen lord of Asphynis or Horakhte-Hemen of Hefat. Flinders Petrie refers to Hemen as a god of Tuphium. Hemen is also used for the name of a town of ancient Egypt (as mentioned by Flinders Petrie during his studies of Abydos).

==Some examples of artifacts containing references to Hemen==
Hemen is mentioned in a limited number of inscriptions and texts. Some of these include:
* In the Pyramid Texts, Utterance 231.
* Ankhtifi, a nomarch (= provincial governor) dated to the First Intermediate Period, is shown inspecting a fleet, killing a hippopotamus in Hefat during festivities and offering the hippopotamus to Hemen.
* A round-topped stela from the 13th dynasty invokes Ptah-Sokari-Osiris and Horus-Hemen lord of Asphynis. The stela was formerly in the V. Golenishchev collection, but is now in Moscow, in the State Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts.
* The chief sculptor Userhat who lived at the end of the 18th dynasty/beginning 19th dynasty mentions &quot;causing cult statues to rest in their shrine&quot;. Hemen of Hefat is one of the gods listed among those Userhat was responsible for.
* Statue from the time of Amenhotep III; Now in Avignon, Musée Calvet.
* In the 22nd dynasty Hemen of Hefat is mentioned as an oracle. A man named Ikeni appears before Hemen in Hefat and the god says &quot;Ikeni is right! He paid (etc.)&quot;.
* The 25th dynasty pharaoh Taharqa is shown before the god Hemen in a statue which is now in the Louvre.
* In ca. 300 BC Hemen&#x27;s cult is still active as attested by an inscription of an official named Hornefer.
* In the Griffiths Institute listing: A stone object with Hemen possibly hawk-headed showing text of Amenophis III ‘beloved of Hemen lord of the sed-festival’.

<text>Vinny Paz (born Vincenzo Edward Pazienza, December 16, 1962), formerly Vinny Pazienza, is an American former professional boxer who held world titles at lightweight and light middleweight. The 2016 film &quot;Bleed for This&quot; is based on his comeback from a spinal injury. In 2022, he was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==

In the 1980s, Pazienza built a reputation along the U.S. East Coast, defeating such opponents as Melvin Paul (KO 2), Joe Frazier Jr. (TKO 7), Harry Arroyo (UD 10), Nelson Bolanos (TKO 6), and Roberto Elizondo (KO in 10). His first world title fight came on June 7, 1987, in Providence, Rhode Island, where he outpointed Greg Haugen over 15 rounds to become the IBF world lightweight champion. The pair would meet two more times: Haugen recovering the title in an immediate rematch, and Pazienza prevailing in a 10-round decision in their rubber match in 1990.

Pazienza failed in title tries in the junior welterweight division: in 1988, against WBC World Champion Roger Mayweather and in 1990, against both WBO Champion Hector &quot;Macho&quot; Camacho and WBA World Champion Loreto Garza.

In 1991, Pazienza moved into the junior middleweight division. This movement was at the advice of his new trainer Kevin Rooney. In his first fight at junior middleweight, he won the USBA championship against Ron Amundsen in a 12-round decision. He defeated the WBA world jr. middleweight champion Gilbert Delé with a 12th-round TKO in Providence, becoming the second fighter in boxing history to win both the lightweight and junior middleweight world championships.

Pazienza was forced to relinquish the title due to a serious car accident in which his neck was broken. He was scheduled for a Jan.10 title defense against Pat Lawlor in Atlantic City but it was called off. Doctors informed him he might never walk again and would certainly never fight again. Pazienza had to wear a medical device called a Halo, a circular metal brace screwed into the skull in four spots and propped up with four metal rods. He had the Halo screwed to his skull for three months, during which time he maintained a workout regimen against doctors orders. He returned to the ring thirteen months after the accident and defeated future WBC world jr. middleweight champion Luis Santana by a 10-round decision.

After the Santana fight, Pazienza went on to defeat Brett Lally by a 6th-round TKO, and then, in another TKO, former world champion Lloyd Honeyghan in the 10th round. Pazienza went on to win the vacant IBO middleweight world title in 1993 with an 11th-round KO over Dan Sherry. Pazienza then went on to beat Roberto Durán twice, both via unanimous decision, with the IBC super middleweight title on the line both times. In the first fight, Durán put Pazienza down in Rounds 2 and 5, but referee Joe Cortez controversially ruled the Round 2 knockdown to be a slip. The first fight divided the people watching as some felt that Durán had won a close fight, but others felt that Pazienza had won either narrowly or widely after finishing strongly in the last five rounds. The second fight was more lopsided in Pazienza&#x27;s favour, as despite the official judges giving Pazienza the win by scores of 116–112, 117–111 and 118–110, the TV commentators expressed puzzlement at the closeness of the official scoring as they thought that Pazienza had won every round in a 120–108 shutout.

In June 1995, Pazienza lost his world title bid against IBF world super middleweight champion Roy Jones Jr. In 1996, Pazienza inflicted then-prospect Dana Rosenblatt&#x27;s only loss (a knockout in four rounds) to win the vacant WBU super middleweight world championship.

In early 2001, Pazienza legally changed his last name to Paz. In 2002, he lost to WBC world super middleweight champion Eric Lucas in what would be his last shot at a world title. In 2004, Paz fought in his last fight, defeating Tocker Pudwill via 10-round unanimous decision. His record stands at 50–10, with 30 wins by knockout and five world titles (the IBF lightweight championship, WBA jr. middleweight championship, IBO super middleweight championship, IBC super middleweight championship, and the WBU super middleweight championship). He also won the USBA title.

== Neck injury ==
On November 12, 1991, Pazienza was a passenger in a car that was involved in a head-on collision in Warwick, Rhode Island, at an estimated speed of , as a result of which he suffered a dislocated vertebra and two fractured vertebrae in his neck. The driver of his car suffered a head injury and the driver of the oncoming car suffered minor injuries. Pazienza sued both drivers and was awarded $926,000, after the District Court for the District of Rhode Island ruled that the driver of the car in which Pazienza was a passenger was solely responsible for causing the accident.

==Television/film appearances==
Outside of boxing, Paz was a guest star on the TV series &quot;Police Academy&quot;, a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, was featured on &quot;The Montell Williams Show&quot;, served as a guest security guard on an episode of &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;, and refereed the Brawl for All fight at WrestleMania XV between Bart Gunn and Butterbean. He appeared in the unreleased 1997 movie &quot;The Good Life&quot;.

The 2016 film &quot;Bleed for This&quot; is based on his comeback from a spinal injury, and stars Miles Teller as Pazienza.

==Legal issues==
Paz has been arrested on a variety of criminal charges, including alcohol-related crimes, domestic violence, passing bad checks, and disorderly conduct.

<text>Hermanubis () is a Graeco-Egyptian god who conducts the souls of the dead to the underworld. He is a syncretism of Hermes from Greek mythology and Anubis from Egyptian mythology. Hermanubis was one of the ancestors of the dog-headed Saint Christopher – a cynocephalus saint, who was, similarly to Anubis / Hermanubis, a powerful ferryman for travelers. 

==Description==

Hermes&#x27; and Anubis&#x27;s similar responsibilities (they were both conductors of souls) led to the god Hermanubis. He was popular during the period of Roman domination over Egypt. Depicted having a human body and a jackal head, with the sacred caduceus that belonged to the Greek god Hermes, he represented the Egyptian priesthood. He engaged in the investigation of truth.

The divine name (&quot;Hermanoubis&quot;) is known from a handful of epigraphic and literary sources, mostly of the Roman period. Plutarch cites the name as a designation of Anubis in his underworldly aspect, while Porphyry refers to Hermanubis as (&quot;sýnthetos&quot;) &quot;composite&quot; and (&quot;mixéllin&quot;) &quot;half-Greek&quot;.

Although it was not common in traditional Greek religion to combine the names of two gods in this manner, the double determination of Hermanubis has some formal parallels in the earlier period. The most obvious is the god Hermaphroditus, attested from the fourth century BC onwards, but his name implies the paradoxical union of two different gods (Hermes and Aphrodite) rather than an assimilation in the manner of Hermanubis.

<doc id="98311" wikidata="Q939129" url="?curid=98311" title="Heryshaf">
<text>In Egyptian mythology, Heryshaf, or Hershef ( &quot;He who is on His Lake&quot;), transcribed in Greek as Harsaphes or Arsaphes () was an ancient ram deity whose cult was centered in ancient Heracleopolis Magna. He was identified with Ra and Osiris in ancient Egyptian religion, as well as Dionysus or Heracles in the &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot;. The identification with Heracles may be related to the fact that in later times his name was sometimes reanalysed as &quot;ḥrj-šf.t&quot; &quot;He who is over strength&quot;. One of his titles was &quot;Ruler of the Riverbanks&quot;. Heryshaf was a creator and fertility god who was born from the primordial waters. He was pictured as a ram or a man with a ram&#x27;s head.

==Temple at Heracleopolis Magna==
The site goes back to the Early Dynastic Period or the Old Kingdom of Egypt. The precise founding date of Herakleopolis is not known, but an entry on the Palermo Stone reporting king Den&#x27;s visit to the sacred lake of Heryshef at Nenj-neswt, suggests that the town had already been founded by the 1st Dynasty. The site was called &quot;nn-nswt&quot; in Demotic which was pronounced &quot;ǝhnes&quot; in Coptic, Heracleopolis (Magna) during the Hellenistic period and the Roman Empire and Ihnasiyya in Egyptian Arabic.

No remains of the Old Kingdom temple survive. Flinders Petrie found remains of a temple at the site dating to the Twelfth Dynasty. The Twelfth Dynasty temple was rebuilt during the Eighteenth Dynasty and later refurbished during the Nineteenth Dynasty. During the reign of Ramesses II, a pronaos was added to the temple. The sixteen palm columns used were taken from existing temples, possibly those of Djedkare Isesi or Sahure. Yasuoka speculates that Ramesses II&#x27;s fourth son, Prince Khaemweset, may have been the official who directed this project.

==High Priests of Heryshaf==
Many of these names are known from the Stela of Pasenhor.
* Nimlot C, son of pharaoh Osorkon II and his queen Djedmutesankh, Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt
* Ptahudjankhef, son of Nimlot C and Tentsepeh C
* Hemptah A, son of Ptahudjankhef and Tentsepeh D
* Pasenhor A, son of Hemptah A and Tjankemit
* Hemptah B, son of Pasenhor A and Petpetdidies

Nedjemankh, whose coffin was looted from Egypt in 2011 and sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art before being returned to Egypt in 2019, is also believed to have been a priest of Heryshaf.

<doc id="98313" wikidata="Q1035843" url="?curid=98313" title="Hesat">
<text>Hesat is an ancient Egyptian goddess in the form of a cow. She was said to provide humanity with milk (called &quot;the beer of Hesat&quot;) and in particular to suckle the pharaoh and several ancient Egyptian bull gods. In the Pyramid Texts she is said to be the mother of Anubis and of the deceased king. She was especially connected with Mnevis, the living bull god worshipped at Heliopolis, and the mothers of Mnevis bulls were buried in a cemetery dedicated to Hesat. In Ptolemaic times (304–30 BC) she was closely linked with the goddess Isis.

In Egyptian mythology, Hathor is one of the main cattle deities as she is the mother of Horus and Ra and closely associated with the role of royalty and kingship. Hesat is one of Hathor&#x27;s manifestations, usually portrayed as a white cow representing purity and the milk that she produces to give life to humanity. Other feminine bovine deities include Sekhat-Hor, Mehet-Weryt, and Shedyt. Their masculine counterparts include Apis, Mnevis, Sema-wer, Ageb-wer.

==Artistic representations==
While there are not many images of Hesat that are recorded and published, there are a few representations on pieces that belong to major museums worldwide. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has in its collection &quot;Scarab with the Representation of Hathor as a Cow&quot;. The hieroglyphs on this late period piece read ḥȜst or ḥsȜt determined with a recumbent cow with the following hieroglyphs:
HA V17 t 
This spelling of her name is using cryptographic substitution, which became established in the New Kingdom. Traditionally phonetic spellings of Hesat&#x27;s name from earlier periods were usually written as follows:
V28 O34 G39 G1 t E4

<doc id="98316" wikidata="Q1960545" url="?curid=98316" title="Flexagon">
<text>In geometry, flexagons are flat models, usually constructed by folding strips of paper, that can be &quot;flexed&quot; or folded in certain ways to reveal faces besides the two that were originally on the back and front.

Flexagons are usually square or rectangular (tetraflexagons) or hexagonal (hexaflexagons). A prefix can be added to the name to indicate the number of faces that the model can display, including the two faces (back and front) that are visible before flexing. For example, a hexaflexagon with a total of six faces is called a hexahexaflexagon.

In hexaflexagon theory (that is, concerning flexagons with six sides), flexagons are usually defined in terms of &quot;pats&quot;.

Two flexagons are equivalent if one can be transformed to the other by a series of pinches and rotations. Flexagon equivalence is an equivalence relation.

== History ==
=== Discovery and introduction of the hexaflexagon ===
The discovery of the first flexagon, a trihexaflexagon, is credited to the British mathematician Arthur H. Stone, while a student at Princeton University in the United States in 1939. His new American paper would not fit in his English binder so he cut off the ends of the paper and began folding them into different shapes. One of these formed a trihexaflexagon. Stone&#x27;s colleagues Bryant Tuckerman, Richard Feynman, and John Tukey became interested in the idea and formed the Princeton Flexagon Committee. Tuckerman worked out a topological method, called the Tuckerman traverse, for revealing all the faces of a flexagon. Tuckerman traverses are shown as a diagram that maps each face of the flexagon to each other face. In doing so, he realized that each face does not always appear in the same state.

Flexagons were introduced to the general public by Martin Gardner in the December 1956 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot; in an article so well-received that it launched Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column which then ran in that magazine for the next twenty-five years. In 1974, the magician Doug Henning included a construct-your-own hexaflexagon with the original cast recording of his Broadway show &quot;The Magic Show&quot;.

=== Attempted commercial development ===
In 1955, Russell Rogers and Leonard D&#x27;Andrea of Homestead Park, Pennsylvania applied for a patent, and in 1959 they were granted U.S. Patent number 2,883,195 for the hexahexaflexagon, under the title &quot;Changeable Amusement Devices and the Like.&quot;

Their patent imagined possible applications of the device &quot;as a toy, as an advertising display device, or as an educational geometric device.&quot; A few such novelties were produced by the Herbick &amp; Held Printing Company, the printing company in Pittsburgh where Rogers worked, but the device, marketed as the &quot;Hexmo&quot;, failed to catch on.

==== Tritetraflexagon ====

The tritetraflexagon is the simplest tetraflexagon (flexagon with square sides). The &quot;tri&quot; in the name means it has three faces, two of which are visible at any given time if the flexagon is pressed flat. The construction of the tritetraflexagon is similar to the mechanism used in the traditional Jacob&#x27;s Ladder children&#x27;s toy, in Rubik&#x27;s Magic and in the magic wallet trick or the Himber wallet.

The tritetraflexagon has two dead ends, where you cannot flex forward. To get to another face you must either flex backwards or flip the flexagon over.
==== Hexatetraflexagon ====
A more complicated cyclic hexatetraflexagon requires no gluing. A cyclic hexatetraflexagon does not have any &quot;dead ends&quot;, but the person making it can keep folding it until they reach the starting position. If the sides are colored in the process, the states can be seen more clearly.

Contrary to the tritetraflexagon, the hexatetraflexagon has no dead ends, and does not ever need to be flexed backwards.

=== Hexaflexagons ===
Hexaflexagons come in great variety, distinguished by the number of faces that can be achieved by flexing the assembled figure. (Note that the word &quot;hexaflexagons&quot; [with no prefixes] can sometimes refer to an ordinary hexahexaflexagon, with six sides instead of other numbers.)

==== Trihexaflexagon ====
A hexaflexagon with three faces is the simplest of the hexaflexagons to make and to manage, and is made from a single strip of paper, divided into nine equilateral triangles. (Some patterns provide ten triangles, two of which are glued together in the final assembly.)

To assemble, the strip is folded every third triangle, connecting back to itself after three inversions in the manner of the international recycling symbol. This makes a Möbius strip whose single edge forms a trefoil knot.

==== Hexahexaflexagon ====
This hexaflexagon has six faces. It is made up of nineteen triangles folded from a strip of paper.


Once folded, faces 1, 2, and 3 are easier to find than faces 4, 5, and 6.

An easy way to expose all six faces is using the Tuckerman traverse, named after Bryant Tuckerman, one of the first to investigate the properties of hexaflexagons. The Tuckerman traverse involves the repeated flexing by pinching one corner and flex from exactly the same corner every time. If the corner refuses to open, move to an adjacent corner and keep flexing. This procedure brings you to a 12-face cycle. During this procedure, however, 1, 2, and 3 show up three times as frequently as 4, 5, and 6. The cycle proceeds as follows:

:1 → 3 → 6 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 5 → 2

And then back to 1 again.

Each color/face can also be exposed in more than one way. In figure 6, for example, each blue triangle has at the center its corner decorated with a wedge, but it is also possible, for example, to make the ones decorated with Y&#x27;s come to the center. There are 18 such possible configurations for triangles with different colors, and they can be seen by flexing the hexahexaflexagon in all possible ways in theory, but only 15 can be flexed by the ordinary hexahexaflexagon. The 3 extra configurations are impossible due to the arrangement of the 4, 5, and 6 tiles at the back flap. (The 60-degree angles in the rhombi formed by the adjacent 4, 5, or 6 tiles will only appear on the sides and never will appear at the center because it would require one to cut the strip, which is topologically forbidden.)

Hexahexaflexagons can be constructed from different shaped nets of eighteen equilateral triangles. One hexahexaflexagon, constructed from an irregular paper strip, is almost identical to the one shown above, except that all 18 configurations can be flexed on this version.

==== Other hexaflexagons ====
While the most commonly seen hexaflexagons have either three or six faces, variations exist with any number of faces. Straight strips produce hexaflexagons with a multiple of three number of faces. Other numbers are obtained from nonstraight strips, that are just straight strips with some joints folded, eliminating some faces. Many strips can be folded in different ways, producing different hexaflexagons, with different folding maps.

=== Higher order flexagons ===
==== Right octaflexagon and right dodecaflexagon ====
In these more recently discovered flexagons, each square or equilateral triangular face of a conventional flexagon is further divided into two right triangles, permitting additional flexing modes. The division of the square faces of tetraflexagons into right isosceles triangles yields the octaflexagons, and the division of the triangular faces of the hexaflexagons into 30-60-90 right triangles yields the dodecaflexagons.

==== Pentaflexagon and right decaflexagon ====
In its flat state, the pentaflexagon looks much like the Chrysler logo: a regular pentagon divided from the center into five isosceles triangles, with angles 72–54–54. Because of its fivefold symmetry, the pentaflexagon cannot be folded in half. However, a complex series of flexes results in its transformation from displaying sides one and two on the front and back, to displaying its previously hidden sides three and four.

By further dividing the 72-54-54 triangles of the pentaflexagon into 36-54-90 right triangles produces one variation of the 10-sided decaflexagon.

==== Generalized isosceles n-flexagon ====
The pentaflexagon is one of an infinite sequence of flexagons based on dividing a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon into &quot;n&quot; isosceles triangles. Other flexagons include the heptaflexagon, the isosceles octaflexagon, the enneaflexagon, and others.

==== Nonplanar pentaflexagon and nonplanar heptaflexagon ====
Harold V. McIntosh also describes &quot;nonplanar&quot; flexagons (i.e., ones which cannot be flexed so they lie flat); ones folded from pentagons called &quot;pentaflexagons&quot;, and from heptagons called &quot;heptaflexagons&quot;. These should be distinguished from the &quot;ordinary&quot; pentaflexagons and heptaflexagons described above, which are made out of isosceles triangles, and they &quot;can&quot; be made to lie flat.

== In popular culture ==
Flexagons are also a popular book structure used by artist&#x27;s book creators such as Julie Chen (&quot;Life Cycle&quot;) and Edward H. Hutchins (&quot;Album&quot; and &quot;Voces de México&quot;). Instructions for making tetra-tetra-flexagon and cross-flexagons are included in &quot;Making Handmade Books: 100+ Bindings, Structures and Forms&quot; by Alisa Golden.

A high-order hexaflexagon was used as a plot element in Piers Anthony&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot;, in which a flex was analogous to the travel between alternate universes.

Vi Hart, a well-known recreational mathematician and public educator, gained attention for her video on hexaflexagons.

<text>Many lists of trees of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] have been written. There are a number of issues surrounding the inclusion of a species in such a list. As can be seen from the outline of debate below, there is no &#x27;correct&#x27; list of trees of Britain and Ireland.

==Issues of debate==

===Definition of species===
There are a number of different opinions regarding the validity of some species, notably apomictic microspecies and whether some &#x27;species&#x27; may actually be hybrids. In particular, the number and definition of species in the genera &quot;Sorbus&quot; (rowans, whitebeams etc.), &quot;Ulmus&quot; (elms) and &quot;Salix&quot; (willows) are open to debate.

===Definition of native===
Native species are considered to be species which are today present in the region in question, and have been continuously present in that region since a certain period of time. When applied to Britain and Ireland, three possible definitions of this time constraint are:
* a species that colonised these islands during the retreat of ice at the end of the last ice age
* a species that was present in these islands when the English Channel was created and the land bridge between Britain and continental Europe was flooded
* a species that has colonised without human assistance; in some cases this is uncertain.

The only endemic tree species in Britain and Ireland (that is, that are native &quot;only&quot; to this region) are some apomictic whitebeams.

Species that were native in the region in prehistory before the last ice age, but not subsequently, are generally regarded as extinct and no longer native.

Many additional species have been imported by humans; the total list of all introduced trees numbers several thousand. A far smaller number of these have become widely naturalised, spreading by their own accord without recourse to further human assistance.

===Definition of tree===
A tree can be defined as a large, perennial, woody plant with secondary branches supported by a primary stem (compare with shrub). There is no set definition regarding minimum size, though most authors cite a tree species as being one which regularly reaches 6 m (20 ft) tall with a single stem. Species like Blackthorn (&quot;Prunus spinosa&quot;) and Purple willow (&quot;Salix purpurea&quot;), which may reach 6 m but not on a single stem, are not treated as trees.

<text>The KIM-1, short for &quot;Keyboard Input Monitor&quot;, is a small 6502-based single-board computer developed and produced by MOS Technology, Inc. and launched in 1976. It was very successful in that period, due to its low price (thanks to the inexpensive 6502 microprocessor) and easy-access expandability.

== History ==
MOS Technology&#x27;s first processor, the 6501, could be plugged into existing motherboards that used the Motorola 6800, allowing potential users (i.e. engineers and hobbyists) to get a development system up and running very easily using existing hardware. Motorola immediately sued, forcing MOS to pull the 6501 from the market. Changing the pin layout produced the &quot;lawsuit-friendly&quot; 6502. Otherwise identical to the 6501, it nevertheless had the disadvantage of having no machine in which new users could quickly start using the CPU.

Chuck Peddle, leader of the 650x group at MOS (and former member of Motorola&#x27;s 6800 team), designed the KIM-1 in order to fill this need. The KIM-1 came to market in 1976. While the machine was originally intended to be used by engineers, it quickly found a large audience with hobbyists. A complete system could be constructed for under with the purchase of the computer itself for only , and then adding a power supply, a secondhand terminal and a cassette tape drive.

Many books were available demonstrating small assembly language programs for the KIM, including &quot;The First Book of KIM&quot; by Jim Butterfield &quot;et al&quot;. One demo program converted the KIM into a music box by toggling a software-controllable output bit connected to a small loudspeaker. Canadian programmer Peter R. Jennings produced what was probably the first game for microcomputers to be sold commercially, &quot;Microchess,&quot; originally for the KIM-1.

As the system became more popular, one of the common additions was the Tiny BASIC programming language. This required an easy memory expansion; &quot;all of the decoding for the first 4 K is provided right on the KIM board. All you need to provide is 4 K more of RAM chips and some buffers.&quot; The hard part was loading the BASIC from cassette tape—a 15-minute, error-prone ordeal.

Rockwell International—who second-sourced the 6502, along with Synertek—released their own microcomputer in one board in 1978, the AIM-65. The AIM included a full ASCII keyboard, a 20-character 14-segment alphanumeric LED display, and a small cash register-like printer. A debug monitor was provided as standard firmware for the AIM, and users could also purchase optional ROM chips with an assembler and a Microsoft BASIC interpreter to choose from.

Finally, there was the Synertek SYM-1 variant, which could be said to be a machine halfway between the KIM and the AIM; it had the KIM&#x27;s small display, and a simple membrane keyboard of 29 keys (hex digits and control keys only), but provided AIM-standard expansion interfaces and true RS-232 (voltage level as well as current loop mode supported).

== Description ==
The KIM-1 consisted of a single printed circuit board with all the components on one side. It included three main ICs; the MCS6502 CPU and two MCS6530 Peripheral Interface/Memory Devices. Each MCS6530 comprises a mask programmable 1024 × 8 ROM, a 64 × 8 RAM, two eight-bit bi-directional ports, and a programmable interval timer. The KIM-1 brochure said &quot;1 K BYTE RAM&quot; but it actually had 1152 bytes. The memory was composed of eight 6102 static RAMs (1024 × 1 bits) and the two 64-byte RAMs of the MCS6530s. In the 1970s memory sizes were expressed in several ways. Semiconductor manufacturers would use a precise memory size such as 2048 by 8 and sometimes state the number of bits (16384). Mini and mainframe computers had various memory widths (8 bits to over 36 bits) so manufacturers would use the term &quot;words&quot;, such as 4K words. The early hobbyist computer advertisements would use both &quot;words&quot; and &quot;bytes&quot;. It was common to see &quot;4096 words&quot;, &quot;4K (4096) words&quot; and &quot;4 K bytes&quot;. The term KB was unused or very uncommon. The KIM-1 was introduced in the April 1976 issue of &quot;BYTE&quot; and the advertisement stated &quot;1 K BYTE RAM&quot; and &quot;2048 ROM BYTES&quot;.

Also included were six 7-segment LEDs (similar to those on a pocket calculator) and a 24-key calculator-type keypad.
Many of the pins of the I/O portions of the 6530s were connected to two connectors on the edge of the board, where they could be used as a serial system for driving a Teletype Model 33 ASR and paper tape reader and punch.

One of these connectors also doubled as the power supply connector and included analog lines that could be attached to a cassette tape recorder.

Earlier microcomputer systems such as the MITS Altair used a series of switches on the front of the machine to enter data. In order to do anything useful, the user had to enter a small program known as the &quot;bootstrap loader&quot; into the machine using these switches, a process known as booting. Once loaded, the loader would be used to load a larger program off a storage device like a paper tape reader. It would often take upwards of five minutes to load the tiny program into memory, and a single error while flipping the switches meant that the bootstrap loader would crash the machine. This could render some of the bootstrap code garbled, in which case the programmer had to reenter the whole thing and start all over again.

The KIM-1 included a somewhat more complex built-in Terminal Interface Monitor software called TIM that was &quot;contained in 2048 bytes of ROM in two 6530 ROM/RAM/IO arrays&quot;. This monitor software included the ability to run a cassette tape for storage, drive the LED display, and run the keypad. As soon as the power was turned on, the monitor would run and the user could immediately start interacting with the machine via the keypad. The KIM-1 was one of the first single-board computers, needing only an external power supply to enable its use as a stand-alone experimental computer. This fact, plus the relatively low cost of getting started, made it quite popular with hobbyists through the late 1970s.

== Video display ==
The designer of the TV Typewriter, Don Lancaster, developed a low-cost video display for the KIM-1. The add-on board would display up to 4000 characters on a TV or monitor. A typical configuration would be 16 lines of 32 upper-case only characters. The board had only 10 low-cost ICs and used the KIM&#x27;s memory for the screen storage.

The TVT-6 project appeared on the cover on &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; in July 1977. The complete kit could be ordered from PAiA Electronics for .

Lancaster expanded this design to do color and simple graphics in &quot;The Cheap Video Cookbook&quot;.

== Specifications ==
* CPU: MCS6502 - clocked at 1 MHz
* two PIO MCS6530 - , , two 8-bit bi-directional ports, 8-bit programmable interval timer
* eight 6102 static RAM - 1024 × 1 (1024 bytes)
* six 7-segment LEDs
* 24-key calculator type keypad
* two serial ports
* Terminal Interface Monitor (TIM), that handled booting, keypad, seven-segment LEDs, and cassette tape

== Tape format ==
Each bit is represented by three 2.484 ms long tones. The first is always 3700 Hz, the middle is 3700 Hz for &quot;0&quot; or 2400 Hz for &quot;1&quot;, and the last one is always 2400 Hz. This gives an effective bit rate of 134.2 bit/s. Detection is done through a PLL using LM565.

The format of data on the tape is: 100 bytes with the value 0x16 (SYN, Synchronous Idle), one byte with the value 0x2A (*), the record identification number, the start address (two characters for the low byte of address, two characters for the high byte), the end address (in the same format), the actual data, one byte with the value 0x2F (&quot;/&quot; character), a two-byte checksum, and two bytes with the value 0x04 (EOT, End Of Transmission).

Each byte of memory is stored as two sequential ASCII characters on tape, for example, hexadecimal B5 in memory (181 decimal) would be stored as two sequential ASCII characters &quot;B&quot; and &quot;5&quot; (42 and 35 hexadecimal).

<text>In Egyptian mythology, Kebechet (spelt in hieroglyphs as Qbḥt (Qebehet) and also transliterated as Khebhut, Kebehut, Qébéhout, Kabehchet and Kebehwet) is a goddess, a deification of embalming liquid. Her name means &quot;cooling water&quot;.

==Myths==
Kebechet is a daughter of Anubis. In the Pyramid Texts, Kebechet is referred to as a serpent who &quot;refreshes and purifies&quot; the pharaoh.

Kebechet was thought to give water to the spirits of the dead while they waited for the mummification process to be complete. She was probably related to mummification where she would fortify the body against corruption, so it would stay fresh for reanimation by the deceased&#x27;s &quot;ka&quot;.

<text>A fruit tree is a tree which bears fruit that is consumed or used by animals and humans.— All trees that are flowering plants produce fruit, which are the ripened ovaries of flowers containing one or more seeds. In horticultural usage, the term &quot;fruit tree&quot; is limited to those that provide fruit for human food. Types of fruits are described and defined elsewhere (see Fruit), but would include &quot;fruit&quot; in a culinary sense, as well as some nut-bearing trees, such as walnuts.

The scientific study and the cultivation of fruits is called pomology, which divides fruits into groups based on plant morphology and anatomy. Some of those groups are pome fruits, which include apples and pears, and stone fruits, which include peaches/nectarines, almonds, apricots, plums and cherries.

==Examples==
* Abiu
* Almond
* Amla (Indian gooseberry)
* Apple
* Apricot
* Avocado
* Bael
* Ber (Indian plum)
* Carambola (starfruit)
* Cashew
* Cherry
* Citrus (orange, lemon, lime, etc.)
* Coconut
* Crab apple
* Damson
* Durian
* Elderberry
* Fig
* Grapefruit
* Guava
* Jackfruit
* Jujube
* Lemon
* Lime
* Loquat
* Lychee
* Mango
* Medlar
* Morello cherry
* Mulberry
* Olive
* Pawpaw, both the tropical &quot;Carica papaya&quot; and the North American &quot;Asimina triloba&quot;
* Peach and nectarine
* Pear
* Pecan
* Persimmon
* Pistachio
* Plum
* Pomelo
* Quince
* Pomegranate
* Rambutan
* Sapodilla (chikoo)
* Soursop
* Sugar-apple (sharifa)
* Sweet chestnut
* Tamarillo
* Ugli fruit
* Walnut
* Water Apple

== Climate effects on fruit trees ==

=== Advantages ===
Fruit trees can withstand the variability of rainfall better than annual crops due to the deep root systems and the perennial growth habit.

=== Disadvantages ===
Climate change is significantly impacting fruit trees, with effects varying depending on the geographical region and type of fruit tree. The annual temperature in Japan, for example, has risen at a rate of 0.124 °C per decade from 1898 to 2019, influencing fruit tree flowering times and potentially leading to a physiological disorder known as &quot;flowering disorder&quot; in Japanese pear, which may result from abnormal flowering or dormancy or both. In Australia, climate change is predicted to prompt a major shift in the fruit farming industry by 2030, affecting the winter chill period necessary for fruit production.

In addition, climate change has caused challenges like early spring and late frosts, flooding, drought, and extreme heat, all of which effect fruit trees. Severe droughts and flooding affect the trees&#x27; growth, making them more susceptible to pests and diseases. Extreme heat can damage growing fruit directly on the tree.

This situation is exacerbated by global trends towards reduced organic matter in soil, necessitating innovative water conservation and management strategies to ensure crop yield and quality.

<text>Walter Hubert Annenberg (March 13, 1908 – October 1, 2002) was an American businessman, investor, philanthropist, and diplomat. Annenberg owned and operated Triangle Publications, which included ownership of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, &quot;TV Guide&quot;, the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; and &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine. He was appointed by President Richard Nixon as United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom, where he served from 1969 to 1974.

During his tenure as U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom, he developed a close friendship with Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the royal family. After initial perceived missteps, he came to be admired for his dedicated work ethic, his wife&#x27;s lavish entertaining, and personal gifts to support patriotic British causes, such as the restoration of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. He also paid for the renovation of Winfield House, the American ambassador&#x27;s residence.

In his later years, Annenberg became one of the most prominent philanthropists in the United States. He established the Annenberg Foundation in 1988, and gave over $2 billion to educational establishments and art galleries, including both the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania and USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in Los Angeles. At Sunnylands, his estate near Palm Springs, California, he entertained royalty, presidents and other celebrities; it is now a museum and retreat center dedicated to furthering the Annenbergs&#x27; legacies.

==Early life and education==
Walter Annenberg was born to a Jewish family in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on March 13, 1908. He was the only son of Sadie Cecelia ( Friedman; 1879–1965) and Moses Annenberg, who published the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; and purchased &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; in 1936. Annenberg was a stutterer since childhood.

He had seven sisters: Diana Annenberg (1900–1905), Esther Annenberg Simon Levee (1901–1992), Janet Annenberg Hooker (1904–1997), Enid Annenberg Bensinger Haupt (1906–2005), Lita Annenberg Hazen (1909–1995), Evelyn Annenberg Jaffe Hall (1911–2005), and Harriet Beatrice Annenberg Ames Aronson (1914–1969).

The Annenberg family moved to Long Island, New York, in 1920. Walter attended Peddie School in Hightstown, New Jersey, where he graduated in 1927. He was admitted to the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, but dropped out without attaining a degree. While in college, he was a member of Zeta Beta Tau, a traditionally Jewish fraternity.

Annenberg was greatly impacted by the tax evasion charges and other scandals involving his father in the 1930s. A significant part of his adult life was dedicated to rehabilitating the family&#x27;s name through philanthropy and public service.

==Business career==
After his father&#x27;s death in 1942, Annenberg took over the family businesses, making successes out of some that had been failing. He bought additional print media as well as radio and television stations, resulting in great success. One of his most prominent successes was the creation of &quot;TV Guide&quot; in 1952, which he started against the advice of his financial advisors. He also created &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine. During the 1970s, &quot;TV Guide&quot; was making profits in the range of $600,000 to $1,000,000 per week.

While Annenberg ran his publishing empire as a business, he was not afraid to use it for his political purposes. One of his publications, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, was influential in ridding Philadelphia of its largely corrupt city government in 1949. It campaigned for the Marshall Plan following World War II and attacked McCarthyism in the 1950s.

In 1966, Annenberg used the &quot;Inquirer&quot; to cast doubt on the candidacy of Democrat Milton Shapp for governor of Pennsylvania. Shapp was highly critical of the proposed merger of the Pennsylvania Railroad with the New York Central Railroad and was pushing the US Interstate Commerce Commission to prevent it from occurring. Annenberg, who was the biggest individual stockholder of the Pennsylvania Railroad, wanted to see the merger succeed (which it did) and he was frustrated with Shapp&#x27;s opposition. During a press conference, an &quot;Inquirer&quot; reporter asked Shapp if he had ever been a patient in a mental hospital. Never having been in one, Shapp simply said &quot;no.&quot; The next day, a five-column front page &quot;Inquirer&quot; headline read, &quot;Shapp Denies Mental Institution Stay&quot;. Shapp and others have attributed his loss of the election to Annenberg&#x27;s newspaper.

At a time when Annenberg was seeking appointment as U.S. ambassador to Great Britain, a &quot;TV Guide&quot; &quot;special editorial&quot; of April 14, 1969, suddenly reversed what had been the publication&#x27;s support of the Smothers Brothers in the duo&#x27;s content fight with their network, CBS. The editorial, &quot;Smothers Out: A Wise Decision,&quot; praised the network cancellation of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, rhetorically asking &quot;Where does satire end -- and sacrilege begin?&quot; Annenberg received the ambassadorship from President Richard Nixon, who at the time was a frequent target of Smothers Brothers on-air barbs and was pressing for more control over television network content.

Even while an active businessman, Annenberg had an interest in public service. In 1953 he became one of the founding trustees of Eisenhower Fellowships. After Richard M. Nixon was elected president, he appointed Annenberg as ambassador to the Court of St James&#x27;s in the UK. In 1969, under pressure after the Shapp controversy, Annenberg sold &quot;The Inquirer&quot; and the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot;, which he bought in 1957, to Knight Newspapers for $55 million. After being appointed as ambassador, he became quite popular in Britain, being made an Honorary Bencher of the Middle Temple on 26 November 1969 and an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1976.

Annenberg led a lavish lifestyle. His Sunnylands winter estate in Rancho Mirage, California (near Palm Springs), hosted gatherings with such people as President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan, Queen Elizabeth II, Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Charles, Prince of Wales, and the family of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Annenberg introduced President Reagan to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and the Reagans often celebrated New Year&#x27;s Eve with the Annenbergs. President Ronald Reagan named Leonore Annenberg the State Department&#x27;s Chief of Protocol in early 1981. Sunnylands covers , guard-gated on a parcel surrounded by a stucco wall at the northwest corner of Frank Sinatra Drive and Bob Hope Drive; the property includes a golf course. The estate continues to be used for meetings and retreats by prominent people.

Annenberg served on the advisory board of U.S. English, an organization that supports making English the official language of the United States. He became a champion of public television, receiving many awards, including the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1985, the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Reagan in 1986, the Linus Pauling Medal for Humanitarianism, the 1988 Eisenhower Medal for Leadership and Service, was made a Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great in 1998, and was named an Officer of the French Legion of Honor. He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1990 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1995.

Annenberg sold Triangle Publications (&quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; and a few other publications) to Australian publishing magnate Rupert Murdoch in 1988 for $3 billion (a record media price at the time), announcing that he would devote his life to philanthropy.

His collection of French impressionist art was valued at approximately US$1 billion in 1991 and was donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City upon his death in 2002. In 1990, he donated $50 million to the United Negro College Fund which was the largest amount ever contributed to the organization. He was also a member of the Founding Council of the Rothermere American Institute at Oxford University, helping to raise funds for the institute&#x27;s building and library.

Annenberg was named Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia&#x27;s Person of the Year in 1983 and was inducted into the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia Hall of Fame in 1992.

In 1995, he received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, one of the Jefferson Awards for Public Service, given out annually by the American Institute for Public Service.

==Philanthropy==
During his lifetime, it is estimated that Annenberg donated over $2 billion. He once said that &quot;education... holds civilization together&quot;. Many school buildings, libraries, theaters, hospitals, and museums across the United States now bear his name.

Annenberg established the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania and the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California. In 1993, he donated 100 million dollars to The Peddie School, the largest donation ever to a school when accounting for inflation.

In the early 1980s, Annenberg founded the Annenberg Center for Health Sciences at Eisenhower in Rancho Mirage, California. In the mid-1980s, he established the Annenberg Fellowship to Eton College, a one-year fellowship for one US graduating college senior (chosen from a rotating list of US universities including Duke, Harvard, Penn, Princeton, Yale, and others) to spend a year teaching and serving as a cultural ambassador to the famous British boys&#x27; school. In 1989, he established the Annenberg Foundation, and 1993, created the Annenberg Challenge, a US$500 million, five-year reform effort and the largest single gift ever made to American public education. 

In 2009, the Annenberg Foundation funded the opening of The Annenberg Space for Photography. In 2019, the center closed. 
==Personal life==
In 1939, Annenberg married Bernice Veronica Dunkelman. Bernice was raised in a Jewish family in Canada, the daughter of Canadian businessman David Dunkelman who was known for mass-producing low-cost suits and selling them at a single price of $14 at his chain of 65 retail stores. They divorced in 1950 after eleven years together. While married, Dunkelman and Annenberg had two children: a daughter, Wallis, and son, Roger. Roger died by suicide in 1962; to commemorate his death, Harvard University, where Roger was a student at the time, now has a Roger Annenberg Hall named in his honor.

In 1951, Annenberg married Leonore &quot;Lee&quot; Cohn. Lee was a niece of Harry Cohn, the founder and president of Columbia Pictures. Although of Jewish ethnicity, she was raised a Christian Scientist by her uncle&#x27;s wife. Despite being born to Jewish families, the Annenbergs were not practitioners of Judaism; they regularly celebrated Easter and Christmas with family and friends. In 1993 Leonore and Walter Annenberg were awarded the National Medal of Arts.

==Death==
Annenberg died at his home in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, on October 1, 2002, from complications of pneumonia; he was 94 years old. He was survived by his wife, Leonore (February 20, 1918 – March 12, 2009); his daughter, Wallis; and two sisters, Enid A. Haupt and Evelyn Hall. Including those by his wife&#x27;s daughters from her first two marriages (Diane Deshong and Elizabeth Kabler), he left seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

<text>Soyuz 1 (, &quot;Union 1&quot;) was a crewed spaceflight of the Soviet space program. Launched into orbit on 23 April 1967 carrying cosmonaut colonel Vladimir Komarov, Soyuz 1 was the first crewed flight of the Soyuz spacecraft. The flight was plagued with technical issues, and Komarov was killed when the descent module crashed into the ground due to a parachute failure. This was the first in-flight fatality in the history of spaceflight.

The original mission plan was complex, involving a rendezvous with Soyuz 2 and an exchange of crew members before returning to Earth. However, the launch of Soyuz 2 was called off due to thunderstorms.

* Perigee: 
* Apogee: 
* Inclination: 50.8°
* Period: 88.7 minutes

== Background ==
Soyuz 1 was the first crewed flight of the first-generation Soyuz 7K-OK spacecraft and Soyuz rocket, designed as part of the Soviet lunar program. It was the first Soviet crewed spaceflight in over two years, and the first Soviet crewed flight following the death of the Chief Designer of the space programme Sergei Korolev. Komarov was launched on Soyuz 1 despite failures of the previous uncrewed tests of the 7K-OK, Kosmos 133 and Kosmos 140. A third attempted test flight was a launch failure; a launch abort triggered a malfunction of the launch escape system, causing the rocket to explode on the pad. The escape system successfully pulled the spacecraft to safety.

According to interviews with Venyamin Russayev, a former KGB agent, prior to launch, Soyuz 1 engineers are said to have reported 203 design faults to party leaders, but their concerns &quot;were overruled by political pressures for a series of space feats to mark the anniversary of Lenin&#x27;s birthday&quot;. Russayev also claims that Yuri Gagarin was the backup pilot for Soyuz 1, and was aware of the design problems and the pressures from the Politburo to proceed with the flight. He attempted to &quot;bump&quot; Komarov from the mission, knowing that the Soviet leadership would not risk a national hero on the flight. At the same time, Komarov refused to pass on the mission, even though he believed it to be doomed. He explained that he could not risk Gagarin&#x27;s life. Russayev&#x27;s account, however, has been seen as implausible and exaggerated by most historians of the Soviet space programme.

Mission planners intended to launch a second Soyuz flight the next day carrying cosmonauts Valery Bykovsky, Yevgeny Khrunov, and Aleksei Yeliseyev, with Khrunov and Yeliseyev scheduled to do an EVA over to Soyuz 1.

== Mission details ==
Soyuz 1 was launched on 23 April 1967 at 00:32 GMT from Baikonur Cosmodrome carrying Komarov, the first Soviet cosmonaut to fly in space twice, in the 7K-OK No. 4 capsule. Problems began shortly after launch when one solar panel failed to unfold, leading to a shortage of power for the spacecraft&#x27;s systems. Komarov transmitted: &quot;Conditions are poor. The cabin parameters are normal, but the left solar panel didn&#x27;t deploy. The electrical bus is at only 13 to 14 amperes. The HF (high frequency) communications are not working. I cannot orient the spacecraft to the sun. I tried orienting the spacecraft manually using the DO-1 orientation engines, but the pressure remaining on the DO-1 has gone down to 180.&quot; Further problems with the orientation detectors complicated maneuvering the craft. By orbit 13, the automatic stabilisation system was completely dead, and the manual system was only partially effective.

The crew of Soyuz 2 modified their mission goals, preparing themselves for a launch that would include fixing the solar panel of Soyuz 1. However, that night, thunderstorms at Baikonur affected the booster&#x27;s electrical system, causing the mission to be called off.

As a result of Komarov&#x27;s report during the 13th orbit, the flight director decided to abort the mission. After 18 orbits, Soyuz 1 fired its retrorockets and reentered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Despite the technical difficulties up to that point, Komarov might still have landed safely. A few minutes before the tragedy, Komarov maintained radio contact with Gagarin, in particular, stating: &quot;The engine was running for 146 seconds. Everything is going fine. Everything is going fine! The ship was oriented correctly. I am in the middle chair. Tied with straps.&quot; To slow the descent, first the drogue parachute was deployed, followed by the main parachute. However, due to a defect, the main parachute did not unfold; the exact reason for the main parachute malfunction is disputed.

Komarov then activated the manually deployed reserve chute, but it became tangled with the drogue chute, which did not release as intended. As a result, the Soyuz descent module fell to Earth in Orenburg Oblast almost entirely unimpeded, at about . A rescue helicopter spotted the descent module lying on its side with the parachute spread across the ground on fire. The retrorockets then started firing which concerned the rescuers since they were supposed to activate a few moments prior to touchdown. By the time they landed and approached, the descent module was in flames with black smoke filling the air and streams of molten metal dripping from the exterior. The entire base of the capsule burned through. By this point, it was obvious that Komarov had not survived, but there was no code signal for a cosmonaut&#x27;s death, so the rescuers fired a signal flare calling for medical assistance. Another group of rescuers in an aircraft then arrived and attempted to extinguish the blazing spacecraft with portable fire extinguishers. This proved insufficient and they instead began using shovels to throw dirt onto it. The descent module then completely disintegrated, leaving only a pile of debris topped by the entry hatch. When the fire at last ended, the rescuers were able to dig through the rubble to find Komarov strapped into the center couch, his body had turned into charred clothing and flesh. Doctors pronounced the cause of death to be from multiple blunt-force injuries. The body was transported to Moscow for an official autopsy in a military hospital where the cause of death was verified to match the field doctors&#x27; conclusions.

The Soyuz 1 crash site coordinates are , which is west of Karabutak, about east-southeast of Orenburg. There is a memorial monument at the site in the form of a black column with a bust of Komarov at the top, in a small park on the roadside.

Posthumously, Komarov was named a Hero of the Soviet Union for the second time, and awarded the Order of Lenin. He was given a state funeral, and his ashes were interred in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis at Red Square, Moscow.

Eight years after Komarov&#x27;s death, a story began circulating that Komarov cursed the engineers and flight staff, and spoke to his wife as he descended, and these transmissions were received by an NSA listening station near Istanbul. Historians such as Asif Azam Siddiqi regard this to be untrue. Komarov&#x27;s final recorded words appear to have been a conversation with a tracking station located near Simferopol on the topic of the separation of the Soyuz modules just before reentry, with the final message received being &quot;Спасибо, передайте всем Произошло&quot; (&quot;Thank you, tell everyone it happened&quot;) [Garbled].

== Legacy ==
The Soyuz 1 tragedy delayed the launch of Soyuz 2 and Soyuz 3 until 25 October 1968. This 18-month gap, with the addition of the explosion of an uncrewed N-1 rocket on 3 July 1969, scuttled Soviet plans of landing a cosmonaut on the Moon. The original mission of Soyuz 1 and Soyuz 2 was ultimately achieved by Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5.

A much improved Soyuz programme emerged from this eighteen-month delay, mirroring the improvements made in the Apollo program after the Apollo 1 tragedy. Although it failed to reach the Moon, the Soyuz went on to be repurposed from the centrepiece of the Zond lunar program to the people-carrier of the Salyut space station program, the Mir space station, and the International Space Station. Although it suffered another tragedy with the Soyuz 11 accident in 1971, and went through several incidents with non-fatal launch aborts and landing mishaps, it has become one of the longest-lived and most dependable crewed spacecraft yet designed.

Komarov is commemorated in two memorials left on the lunar surface: one left at Tranquility Base by Apollo 11, and the &quot;Fallen Astronaut&quot; statue and plaque left by Apollo 15.

<text>Elmo is a red Muppet character on the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. A furry red monster who speaks in a high-pitched falsetto voice and frequently refers to himself in the third person, he hosts the last full 15-minute segment (five minutes starting in 2017) on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot;, which is aimed at toddlers. He was originally performed by Kevin Clash. Following Clash&#x27;s resignation in late 2012, Elmo has been performed by Ryan Dillon.

==History==
Elmo is self-described as three-and-a-half years old and his birthday is on February 3. Elmo characteristically avoids pronouns in reference to himself, instead referring to himself in the third person (e.g., saying &quot;Elmo wants this&quot; instead of &quot;I want this&quot;). &quot;Sesame Street&quot; staff writer Nancy Sans once described Elmo&#x27;s origins: &quot;There was this extra red puppet lying around and the cast would pick him up sometimes and try to create a personality, but nothing seemed to materialize.&quot;
The character of Elmo was originally conceived as a supporting character and background character by Henson Associates-based Muppet artist/builder Caroly Wilcox in 1979, first appearing in the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; song &quot;We Are All Monsters&quot;, which first aired in a Season 11 episode during 1980. Elmo became a named and recurring character on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; (during the street storylines) sometime later that season (episode 1439, to be exact), although he still appeared as a supporting character in segments in later episodes of the show at the time. The character was performed by a rotating ensemble of Muppet performers such as Jerry Nelson and Kathryn Mullen while he was a background character in such &quot;Sesame Street&quot; segments from 1980 to 1984. As a named character, Elmo was performed by Brian Muehl from 1980 to 1984, and later Richard Hunt from 1984 to 1985 upon Muehl&#x27;s departure. However, in 1985, Hunt was so frustrated with the puppet, he squeezed it and threw it at Kevin Clash, who then performed Elmo. Clash said that Elmo should be a character who is kind and loving. Sans says of Clash, &quot;one day in 1985, Kevin Clash, a talented puppeteer, raised him up and brought energy and life into Elmo and from that day forward we would all write for Elmo.&quot; Modern Elmo debuted with the Season 17 premiere of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, episode 2096 (first aired November 18, 1985, following the release of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; film &quot;Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird&quot;). In the episode, Big Bird is tired of the adults refusing to believe him about Snuffy, so he decides to arrange for them to come to his nest and meet Snuffy, and Elmo offers to help. Snuffy returns, then tells Elmo he had better go home and brush his fur to prepare for the grown-ups&#x27; arrival, but Elmo holds on to his snuffle so he cannot go; as such, the adults meet Snuffy for the first time ever. Clash cites a moment later in season 17 (from Episode 2215 in which Elmo packs for an imaginary vacation) as the moment when he &quot;found his voice&quot; as Elmo, and by 1987, he became added to various episodes and product lines. John Tartaglia, Matt Vogel, and Jim Martin have all been secondary performers for the character, providing movement for Elmo&#x27;s arms and legs, particularly in green-screen shots.

Alongside Cookie Monster, Elmo has appeared in &quot;The Furchester Hotel&quot;, where he is taking an extended stay because of his fascination with the Furchester Hotel. His father Louie is the brother of Funella Furchester. 
On May 27, 2020, &quot;The Not Too Late Show with Elmo&quot; premiered on Max. The series stars Elmo as the host of his own late-night talk show.

==Popular culture==
After becoming a regular guest on &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;, Elmo began touring the talk-show circuit. He has appeared on &quot;Martha Stewart Living,&quot; &quot;Martha&quot;, &quot;The Tony Danza Show&quot;, &quot;Rove Live&quot;, &quot;Wait Wait...Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;, and &quot;The View&quot;. Elmo and a developmental expert gave babysitting tips on the June 18, 2005, episode of &quot;Teen Kids News&quot;. He has also appeared on &quot;Emeril Live&quot;, helping Emeril make (non-alcoholic) eggnog during a holiday special shown in December 2008. Kevin Clash and Aaron Neville were also guests on this show. On a special episode of &quot;Oprah&quot; called &quot;The Faces Behind the Famous Names&quot;, Kevin Clash and Elmo appeared at the same time.

Elmo was the star of the 1999 full-length, theatrically released motion picture &quot;The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland&quot;. He also starred in the special &quot;Elmo Saves Christmas&quot;.

Elmo also appeared in a fifth-season episode of &quot;The West Wing&quot; along with his friends Zoe and Big Bird. In that episode, Elmo receives a medical checkup from Abbey Bartlet, the First Lady (who is making a guest appearance on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;), and cheekily questions her about the validity of her medical license.

Elmo also appeared in the eighth-season episode of &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;My ABC&#x27;s&quot;, along with Oscar the Grouch, Grover, and an Anything Muppet named &quot;Ex Ray&quot;. All four characters are in separate fantasies of J.D.&#x27;s in the episode.

At the request and with the assistance of Rep. Duke Cunningham, he testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education in April 2002, urging support for increased funding in music education.

&quot;Emeril and Elmo&#x27;s Healthy Start&quot; was a special featuring Elmo and Emeril Lagasse that aired on November 4, 2005, at 8 p.m. as part of the Food Network&#x27;s second annual &quot;Cook With Your Kids Week&quot;. The special was produced in conjunction with Sesame Workshop&#x27;s Healthy Habits for Life program.

In 1996, a Tickle Me Elmo doll became a fad toy.

Some traditionalist fans of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; have complained that Elmo&#x27;s prominent status has caused roles to be greatly reduced for several older characters, with some referring to him as the &quot;Little Red Menace&quot;. Some fans also blame Elmo for the semi-permanent departure of Kermit the Frog from &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

In its FAQ, the Sesame Workshop addresses the allegation that Elmo referring to himself in the third person will teach children improper English, by stating that this behavior &quot;mimics the behavior of many preschoolers. Like 3-year-olds, he doesn&#x27;t always have the skills or knowledge to speak proper English.&quot;

<doc id="98352" wikidata="Q636497" url="?curid=98352" title="Stock character">
<text>A stock character, also known as a character archetype, is a type of character in a narrative (e.g. a novel, play, television show, or film) whom audiences recognize across many narratives or as part of a storytelling tradition or convention. There is a wide range of stock characters, covering people of various ages, social classes and demeanors. They are archetypal characters distinguished by their simplification and flatness. As a result, they tend to be easy targets for parody and to be criticized as clichés. The presence of a particular array of stock characters is a key component of many genres, and they often help to identify a genre or subgenre. For example, a story with the stock characters of a knight-errant and a witch is probably a fairy tale or fantasy.

There are several purposes to using stock characters. Stock characters are a time- and effort-saving shortcut for story creators, as authors can populate their tale with existing well-known character types. Another benefit is that stock characters help to move the story along more efficiently, by allowing the audience to already understand the character and their motivations. Furthermore, stock characters can be used to build an audience&#x27;s expectations and, in some cases, they can also enhance narrative elements like suspense, irony, or plot twists if those expectations end up subverted.

==Academic analysis==

There is often confusion between stock characters, archetypes, stereotypes, and clichés. In part this confusion arises due to the overlap between these concepts. Nevertheless, these terms are not synonyms. The relationship is that basic archetypes (such as &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;father figure&quot;) and stock characters (such as &quot;damsel in distress&quot; and &quot;wise fool&quot;) are the raw source material that authors use to build on and create fleshed-out, interesting characters. In contrast, stereotypes and clichés are generally viewed as signs of &quot;bad writing or shallow thinking&quot;. Some stereotypes, such as racial stereotype characters, may be offensive to readers or viewers.

According to Dwight V. Swain, a creative writing professor and prolific fiction author, all characters begin as stock characters and are fleshed out only as far as needed to advance the plot. E. Graham McKinley says &quot;there is general agreement on the importance to drama of &#x27;stock&#x27; characters. This notion has been considerably explored in film theory, where feminists have argued, female stock characters are only stereotypes (child/woman, whore, bitch, wife, mother, secretary or girl Friday, career women, vamp, etc.).&quot; Ulrike Roesler and Jayandra Soni analyze &quot;not only with female stock characters in the sense of typical roles in the dramas, but also with other female persons in the area of the theatrical stage...&quot;

Andrew Griffin, Helen Ostovich, and Holger Schott Syme explain further that &quot;Female stock characters also permit a close level of audience identification; this is true most of all in &quot;The Troublesome Reign&quot;, where the &quot;weeping woman&quot; type is used to dramatic advantage. This stock character provides pathos as yet another counterpoint to the plays&#x27; comic business and royal pomp.&quot;

Tara Brabazon discusses how the &quot;school ma&#x27;am on the colonial frontier has been a stock character of literature and film in Australia and the United States. She is an ideal foil for the ill mannered, uncivilised hero. In American literature and film, the spinster from East – generally Boston – has some stock attributes.&quot; Polly Welts Kaufman shows that the schoolma&#x27;am&#x27;s &quot;genteel poverty, unbending morality, education, and independent ways make her character a useful foil for the two other female stock characters in Western literature: the prostitute with the heart of gold and the long-suffering farmer&#x27;s wife.&#x27;&quot;

Stock characters can be further identified as an &quot;alazon&quot;, the &quot;impostor and self-deceiving braggart&quot; in a story, or an &quot;eiron&quot;, a &quot;self-derogatory and understating character&quot;.
===American film===
In American popular films, there are a wide range of stock characters, which are typically used as non-speaking extras in the background, bit parts with a single line, minor secondary/supporting roles, or major secondary/supporting roles. Stock characters in American films have changed over the decades. A 1930s or 1940s film&#x27;s stock characters include newspaper vendors, ice vendors, street sweepers, and cigarette girls; in contrast, a 1990s film has homeless &quot;bag ladies&quot;, pimps, plainclothes police, business women, and Black and Hispanic stereotypes.

Stock characters in American popular culture, especially racial and ethnic stereotypes, often came to be seen as offensive in later decades and were replaced with new stereotypes. For example, the &quot;lazy Black&quot; and the &quot;treacherous bespectacled Japanese&quot; were replaced in the 1990s with the &quot;street-smart Brother&quot; and the &quot;camera-happy Japanese tourist&quot;. Other groups more frequently represented as stock characters include women, Native Americans, Hispanics, Arabs, Gays/Lesbians, Jews, and Italians.
Other briefly popular stock characters include the 1950s &quot;overweight Communist cell leader&quot; and the 1970s &quot;Black Panther revolutionary&quot;.

Even in timeless occupations, the person in the job has changed, reflecting cultural and demographic changes.
 In the 1990s, a hairdresser (previously French) was often depicted as a gay man, a gardener (previously White) as Asian or Hispanic, a bartender (previously White) as Black, and a maid (previously Black) as Hispanic.

===Television===
Due to the scheduling constraints on television production, in which episodes need to be quickly scripted and shot, television scriptwriters often depend heavily on stock characters borrowed from popular film. TV writers use these stock characters to quickly communicate to the audience. In the late 1990s, there was a trend for screenwriters to add a gay stock character, which replaced the 1980s era&#x27;s &quot;African-American workplace pal&quot; stock character. In the 1990s, a number of sitcoms introduced gay stock characters with the quality of the depictions being viewed as setting a new bar for onscreen LGBT depiction.

One challenge with the use of stock characters in TV shows is that, as with films, these stock characters can incorporate racial stereotypes, and &quot;prejudicial and demeaning images&quot;. One concern raised with these gay stock characters is they tend to be shown as just advice-giving &quot;sidekicks&quot; who are not truly integrated into the narrative; as well, the gay character&#x27;s life is not depicted, apart from their advice-giving interactions with the main characters. This also echoed the way that Black and Latino characters were used in 1980s and early 1990s shows: they were given a stock character role as a police chief, which in put them in a position of power, but then these characters were used as minor characters, with little narrative interaction with main characters. In the 2000s, with changing views on depicting race, Latino/a characters are both typecast into stock characters and the writers play with viewer expectations by making a seemingly stock Latino/a character act or behave &quot;against type&quot;.

Southern sheriff stock characters are depicted with a negative stereotype of being obese, poorly trained, uneducated, and racist, as was done with Sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane from &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;.

==Copyright law==
In the United States, courts have determined that copyright protection cannot be extended to the characteristics of stock characters in a story, whether it be a book, play, or film.

<doc id="98356" wikidata="Q487494" url="?curid=98356" title="Tesco">
<text>Tesco plc () is a British multinational groceries and general merchandise retailer headquartered in the United Kingdom at its head offices in Welwyn Garden City, England. The company was founded by Jack Cohen in Hackney, London, in 1919. In 2011, it was the third-largest retailer in the world measured by gross revenues and the ninth-largest in the world measured by revenues. It is the market leader of groceries in the UK (where it has a market share of around 28.4%). As well as the United Kingdom, Tesco has stores in Czechia, Ireland, Slovakia, and Hungary.

Since the 1960s, Tesco has diversified into areas such as the retailing of books, clothing, electronics, furniture, toys, petrol, software, financial services, telecommunications and internet services. In the 1990s, Tesco re-positioned itself from being a downmarket high-volume low-cost retailer, attempting to attract a range of social groups with its low-cost &quot;Tesco Value&quot; range (launched 1993) and premium &quot;Tesco Finest&quot; range.

Tesco is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

==History==
===Origins===
Jack Cohen, the son of Jewish migrants from Poland, founded Tesco in 1919 when he began to sell war-surplus groceries from a stall at Well Street Market, Hackney, in the East End of London. The Tesco brand first appeared in 1924. The name came about after Jack Cohen bought a shipment of tea from &quot;Thomas Edward Stockwell&quot;. He made new labels using the initials of the supplier&#x27;s name (TES), and the first two letters of his surname (CO), forming the word TESCO.

After experimenting with his first permanent indoor market stall at Tooting in November 1930, Jack Cohen opened the first Tesco shop in September 1931 at 54 Watling Avenue, Burnt Oak, Edgware, Middlesex. Tesco was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1947 as Tesco Stores (Holdings) Limited. The first self-service shop opened in St Albans in 1948 (which remained operational until 2010 before relocating to larger premises on the same street, with a period as a Tesco Metro), and the first supermarket in Maldon in 1956.

===Expansion===
During the 1950s and 1960s, Tesco grew organically, and also through acquisitions, until it owned more than 800 shops. The company purchased 70 &quot;Williamson&#x27;s&quot; shops (1957), 200 &quot;Harrow Stores&quot; outlets (1959), 212 &quot;Irwins&quot; shops (1960), 97 &quot;Charles Phillips&quot; shops (1964) and the Victor Value chain (1968) (sold to Bejam in 1986).

Jack Cohen&#x27;s business motto was &quot;pile it high and sell it cheap&quot;, to which he added an internal motto of &quot;YCDBSOYA&quot; (You Can&#x27;t Do Business Sitting On Your Arse) which he used to motivate his sales force.

In May 1987, Tesco completed its hostile takeover of the Hillards chain of 40 supermarkets in the North of England for £220 million.

In 1994, the company took over the supermarket chain William Low after fighting off Sainsbury&#x27;s for control of the Dundee-based firm, which operated 57 shops. This paved the way for Tesco to expand its presence in Scotland, in which its presence was weaker than in England.

Tesco introduced a loyalty card, branded &#x27;Clubcard&#x27; in 1995, and later an Internet shopping service. In 1996 the typeface of the logo was changed to the current version with stripe reflections underneath, whilst the corporate font used for shop signage was changed from the familiar &quot;typewriter&quot; font that had been used since the 1970s. Overseas operations were introduced in the same year. Terry Leahy assumed the role of Chief Executive on 21 February 1997, the appointment having been announced on 21 November 1995.

On 21 March 1997, Tesco announced the purchase of the retail arm of Associated British Foods, which consisted of the Quinnsworth, Stewarts and Crazy Prices chains in Ireland and Northern Ireland, and associated businesses, for £640 million. The deal was approved by the European Commission on 6 May 1997.

The company was the subject of a letter bomb campaign lasting five months from August 2000 to February 2001 as a bomber calling himself &quot;Sally&quot; sent letter bombs to Tesco customers and demanded that Clubcards be modified to be capable of withdrawing money from cash machines.

===Diversification===

The company started to expand the range of products it sold during the 1960s to include household goods and clothing under the Delamare brand, and in 1974 opened its first petrol station.

In 2001, Tesco became involved in internet grocery retailing in the US when it obtained a 35% stake in GroceryWorks.

In 2002, Tesco purchased 13 HIT hypermarkets in Poland. It also made a major move into the UK&#x27;s convenience shop market with its purchase of T&amp;S Stores, owner of 870 convenience shops in the One Stop, Dillons, and Day &amp; Nite chains in the UK.

In June 2003, Tesco purchased the C Two-Network in Japan. It also acquired a majority stake in the Turkish supermarket chain Kipa. In January 2004, Tesco acquired Adminstore, owner of 45 Cullens, Europa, and Harts convenience shops, in and around London.

In Thailand, Tesco Lotus was a joint venture of the Charoen Pokphand Group and Tesco, but facing criticism over the growth of hypermarkets CP Group sold its Tesco Lotus shares in 2003. In late 2005 Tesco acquired the 21 remaining Safeway/BP shops after Morrisons dissolved the Safeway/BP partnership.

In 2006, Tesco announced plans to move into the United States by opening a chain of small-format groceries in the Western states (Arizona, California, and Nevada) in 2007 named Fresh &amp; Easy. Tesco would eventually pull out of the United States market in 2013, following performance issues.

===2010s===
In 2010, Tesco started funding a small film studio intended to produce Tesco-exclusive direct-to-DVD films. The first film was released on 6 September called &quot;Paris Connections&quot;, based on a popular novel by Jackie Collins.

In 2013, Tesco confirmed that it was pulling out of its US market (Fresh &amp; Easy) stores in April, after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, at a reported cost of £1.2 billion. In September, Tesco announced that it would sell the business to Ronald Burkle&#x27;s Yucaipa Companies for an undisclosed amount. That same month, Tesco launched its first tablet computer, a seven-inch model called Hudl. Tesco also purchased the restaurant and cafe chain Giraffe for £48.6 million.
In 2015, Tesco confirmed the sale of its Blinkbox on-demand video service and its fixed-line telephone and broadband business to TalkTalk. In January, Tesco sold the Blinkbox Music streaming service to now-defunct Guvera, and confirmed it would close its Blinkbox Books service by the end of February.

In 2016, Tesco confirmed it was seeking to sell Dobbies Garden Centres, Giraffe Restaurants, and Harris + Hoole to concentrate on its main supermarket business.

In 2017, it was announced that Tesco had reached an agreement to merge with Britain&#x27;s biggest wholesaler Booker Group. There were however concerns over market dominance with Tesco being Britain&#x27;s largest food retailer and Booker being the UK&#x27;s largest wholesaler. In April, the company confirmed it would sell its in-shop opticians&#x27; business to Vision Express. In June, Tesco announced a major cost-cutting initiative that would reduce the company&#x27;s workforce by over 1,200 workers. Key reductions included over a quarter of its employees in Welwyn Garden City and Hatfield, and the closure of the call centre in Cardiff. The company hoped to reduce costs by £1.5 billion.

In 2019, Tesco announced another cost-cutting initiative that would close the food counters in 90 stores, affecting around 9,000 workers. In October 2019, Tesco announced that CEO Dave Lewis would step down in 2020, and would be succeeded by Ken Murphy.

In 2023, Tesco acquired all nine Shoprite shops on the Isle of Man from the Nicholson family who had built the chain up since 1972.

==UK operations==
As of April 2023, Tesco&#x27;s UK shop portfolio was as follows:
===Tesco===
====Hypermarkets====

Tesco Extra shops are larger, mainly out-of-town hypermarkets that stock nearly all of Tesco&#x27;s product ranges, although some are in the heart of town centres and inner-city locations. The largest shop in England by floor space is Tesco Extra in Walkden, with of floor space.

In common with other towns, such as Warrington, the St Helens shop, which at is one of the biggest in England, was developed on the same site as the town&#x27;s new rugby league stadium.

====Supermarkets====

Tesco Superstores are standard large supermarkets, stocking groceries and a much smaller range of non-food goods than Extra hypermarkets. The shops have always been branded as &#x27;Tesco&#x27;, but a new shop in Liverpool was the first to use the format brand &#x27;Tesco Superstore&#x27; above the door.

Tesco operates a number of in-shop cafes. The company also began to introduce new restaurants in its shops from 2013 under the &quot;Decks Carvery&quot; brand.

====Tesco Express====

Tesco Express shops are neighbourhood convenience shops averaging , stocking mainly food with an emphasis on higher-margin products such as sweets, crisps, chocolate, biscuits, fizzy drinks, and processed food (due to small shop size, and the necessity to maximise revenue per square foot) alongside everyday essentials. They are located in busy city-centre districts, small shopping precincts in residential areas, small towns, and villages, and on Esso petrol station forecourts. In 2010 it became known that Tesco was operating Express pricing, charging more in its Express branches than in its other stores. A spokesperson said that this was &quot;because of the difference in costs of running the smaller shops&quot;.

====Fuel stations====

Tesco first started selling petrol in 1974. Tesco sells 95, 97, and 99 RON (a fuel developed by Greenergy of which Tesco is a shareholder) petrol from forecourts at most Superstore and Extra locations. Tesco recently diversified into biofuels, offering petrol-bioethanol and diesel-biodiesel blends instead of pure petrol and diesel at its petrol stations, and now offering Greenergy 100% biodiesel at many shops in the southeast of the United Kingdom. In 1998, Tesco and Esso (part of ExxonMobil) formed a business alliance that included several petrol filling stations on lease from Esso, with Tesco operating the attached shops under its Express format. In turn, Esso operates the forecourts and sells fuel via the Tesco shop. As of 2013, there were 200 joint Tesco Express/Esso sites in the UK.

====Online====

In the United Kingdom Tesco operates a home shopping service through the Tesco.com website. In May 1984, in Gateshead, England, Mrs. Jane Snowball used a piece of computer technology called &quot;Videotex&quot; on her television to purchase groceries from her local Tesco shop in the world&#x27;s first recorded online shopping transaction from the home. As of November 2006, Tesco was the only food retailer to make online shopping profitable. Since 2006 Tesco has operated a number of dark stores dedicated to the fulfilment of online orders of groceries.

====Loyalty card====

Tesco launched its customer loyalty scheme, the Tesco Clubcard, in 1995. It has been cited as a pivotal development in Tesco&#x27;s progress towards becoming the UK&#x27;s largest supermarket chain and one that fundamentally changed the country&#x27;s supermarket business. Tesco itself was cited in a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article as using the intelligence from the Clubcard to thwart Wal-Mart&#x27;s initiatives in the UK.

Cardholders can collect one Clubcard point for every £1 (or one point for €1 in Ireland and Slovakia or 1 point for 1zł in Poland) they spend in a Tesco shop, or at Tesco.com, and 1 point per £2 on fuel (not in Slovakia). Customers can also collect points by paying with a Tesco Credit Card, or by using Tesco Mobile, Tesco Homephone, Tesco Broadband, selected Tesco Personal Finance products, or through Clubcard partners, E.ON and Avis. Each point equates to 1p in shops when redeemed, or up to four times that value when used with Clubcard deals (offers for holidays, day trips, etc.) Clubcard points (UK &amp; IE) can also be converted to Avios and Virgin Atlantic frequent flyer miles.

===One Stop===

One Stop, which includes some of the smallest shops (smaller than a Tesco Express), was (until 2018, when the first Jack&#x27;s store opened) the only Tesco shop format in the UK that did not include the word Tesco in its name. The brand, along with the original shops, formed part of the T&amp;S Stores business but, unlike many that were converted to Tesco Express, these kept their old name. Subsequently, other shops bought by Tesco have been converted to the One Stop brand. Some have Tesco Bank branded cash machines. The business has attracted some controversy, as the prices of groceries in these shops, often situated in more impoverished areas, can be higher than nearby Tesco branded shops, highlighted in &quot;The Times&quot; 22 March 2010: &quot;Britain&#x27;s biggest supermarket uses its chain of 639 One Stop convenience shops–which many customers do not realise it owns–to charge up to 14 per cent more for goods than it does in Tesco-branded shops.&quot;

Tesco responded to the article stating &quot;It is a separate business within the Tesco Group, with its own supply chain and distribution network. One Stop shops offer a different range to Express shops and its operating costs are different. One Stop&#x27;s price strategy is to match to its nearest competitor, Costcutter, and is frequently cheaper.&quot;

==Subsidiaries==
===Booker Group===

Tesco completed its acquisition of the food wholesaler Booker in March 2018. Booker also owns the Budgens, Londis, Euro Shopper, and Premier Stores brands which operate under franchises.

===Tesco Bank===

In the United Kingdom Tesco offers financial services through Tesco Bank, formerly a 50:50 joint venture with The Royal Bank of Scotland. Products on offer include credit cards, loans, mortgages, savings accounts, and several types of insurance, including car, home, life, and travel. They are promoted by leaflets in Tesco&#x27;s shops and through its website. The business made a profit of £130 million for the 52 weeks to 24 February 2007, of which Tesco&#x27;s share was £66 million. This move towards the financial sector diversified the Tesco brand and provides opportunities for growth outside of the retailing sector. On 28 July 2008, Tesco announced that it would buy out the Royal Bank of Scotland&#x27;s 50% stake in the company for £950 million.

===F&amp;F===
F&amp;F launched in 2001 as Florence &amp; Fred in Tesco&#x27;s UK and Ireland supermarkets. In 2010, the brand started to open stores in of itself starting with a London store. In the early to mid-2010s, it expanded to multiple countries stores and online.

In the UK, F&amp;F had its own website until 2016 when it was folded into Tesco Direct - which itself folded in August 2018. After this, F&amp;F had no online UK presence until it partnered with Next PLC a year later. Tesco launched a scaled-down F&amp;F on Tesco.com soon after its deal with Next.

===Tesco Mobile===

Tesco operates a mobile phone business across the United Kingdom, Ireland, Slovakia, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. It first launched in the UK in 2003 as a joint venture with O2 and operates as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) using the network of O2 with the exceptions of Hungary where the network of Vodafone Hungary is used and Ireland where Three Ireland is used. As a virtual operator, Tesco Mobile does not own or operate its own network infrastructure. By January 2011 Tesco announced it had over 2.5 million UK mobile customers.

Tesco also operated a home telephone and broadband business. Its broadband service was launched in August 2004 to complement its existing internet service provider business, providing an ADSL-based service delivered via BT phone lines. In January 2015, Tesco sold its home telephone and broadband business, together with Blinkbox, to TalkTalk for around £5 million. Its customers were transferred by 2016.

===Tesco Tech Support===
Tesco acquired a small I.T. support company called The PC Guys in 2007, and were able to launch Tesco Tech Support in December 2008.

==Former operations==
===Tesco Home &#x27;n&#x27; Wear===
In the 1960s, Tesco set up a non-food division, Tesco Home &#x27;n&#x27; Wear, headed by Leslie Porter. It had stand-alone shops and departments in larger shops, and from 1975 a distribution centre in Milton Keynes. Although Tesco continued to stock non-food items the stand-alone shops were closed and the name was no longer in use when Tesco Extra was launched.

===Tesco Homeplus===
In May 2005, Tesco announced a trial non-food only format near Manchester and Aberdeen, and the first shop opened in October 2005. The shops offered all of Tesco&#x27;s ranges except food in warehouse-style units in retail parks. Tesco introduced the format as only 20% of its customers had access to a Tesco Extra, and the company was restricted in how many of its superstores it could convert into Extras and how quickly it could do so. Large units for non-food retailing are much more readily available. The format was not Tesco&#x27;s first non-food-only venture in the UK. Until the late 1990s/early 2000s there were several non-food Tesco shops around the country including Scarborough and Yate. Although not in a warehouse-style format, the shops were located on high streets and shopping centres and stocked similar items to Homeplus shops. In both cases, this was because another part of the shopping centre had a Tesco Superstore that stocked food items only. By 2014, the number of Homeplus shops in the United Kingdom had reached 12; the newest shop opened in Chester in July 2009. In 2012 it was reported that Tesco was looking to close the business to focus on groceries. Tesco closed six Homeplus shops on 15 March 2015, and the remaining six shops closed on 27 June 2015.

=== Tesco Metro ===

Tesco Metro shops were sized between Tesco superstores and Tesco Express shops, averaging . They were mainly located in town centres and other urban locations and were designed to accommodate larger weekly shops as well as top-up shopping.

In May 2021, Tesco announced the brand would be retired as only 31% of customers were using the stores for larger shops. 89 locations converted to the Tesco Express format while the remaining 58 adopted the standard superstore format.

===Dobbies Garden Centres===

Dobbies is a chain of garden centres across Scotland, England, and Northern Ireland. Tesco completed its acquisition of Dobbies in 2008, and the company continued to trade under its own brand, from its own head office in Melville, near Edinburgh. On 17 June 2016, Tesco sold the company on to a group of investors led by Midlothian Capital Partners and Hattington Capital for £217 million.

===Harris + Hoole===

In 2012, Tesco invested in a new coffee shop chain, named Harris + Hoole after coffee-loving characters in Samuel Pepys&#x27; diary. Tesco took full ownership of the business from its founders Nick, Andrew and Laura Tolley in February 2016, and agreed in June 2016 to sell it to Caffè Nero.

===Giraffe===
Giraffe is a restaurant chain in the United Kingdom which Tesco purchased in March 2013 as part of a strategy of making use of excess space in its shops. Tesco sold the chain to Boparan Holdings in June 2016.

===Euphorium Bakery===
Euphorium Bakery opened a concession in Tesco&#x27;s Kensington shop in 2012, and in 2013 Tesco bought a stake in the business. It purchased the remaining stake in April 2015. In August 2016, Tesco sold Euphorium&#x27;s high street shops and factory in Islington to Soho Coffee, and its factory in Weybridge to Samworth Brothers.

===Jack&#x27;s===
In 2018, Tesco launched a separate budget chain, Jack&#x27;s, to compete with Lidl and Aldi; the first store opened in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire in September 2018. In January 2022 Tesco announced it would be shutting down its Jack&#x27;s stores, with stores either being closed or converted to Tesco Superstores.

==International operations==
Tesco expanded its operations from the United Kingdom to 11 other countries. Tesco pulled out of the United States in 2013, but continued to see growth elsewhere. Tesco&#x27;s international expansion strategy has responded to the need to be sensitive to local expectations in other countries by entering into joint ventures with local partners, such as Samsung Group in South Korea (Samsung-Tesco Home plus), and Charoen Pokphand in Thailand (Tesco Lotus), appointing a very high proportion of local personnel to management positions. It also makes small acquisitions as part of its strategy: for example, in its 2005/2006 financial year, it made acquisitions in South Korea, one in Poland, and one in Japan.

===Operations===
The following table shows the number of stores, total store size in area, and sales for Tesco&#x27;s international operations. The store numbers and floor area figures are .

===Former operations===
=== Czech Republic ===

Tesco opened its first store in the Czech Republic in 1996. The company currently has over 300 stores in the country, with further openings planned. Tesco opened its first stores in the Czech Republic by buying US corporation Kmart&#x27;s operations in the country and converting them into Tesco stores. Tesco is also keen to expand non-food items and has already opened petrol stations and offers personal finance services in the Czech Republic.

=== Hungary ===

Tesco launched in Hungary in 1994 (23 November) after purchasing a small local supermarket group trading as S-Market based in Szombathely, in the west of Hungary. It opened its first hypermarket in Hungary at the Polus Centre in Budapest in 1996. Tesco operates through more than 200 stores in Hungary with further openings planned. Tesco Hungary also offers a clothing line and personal finance services.

=== Slovakia ===

Tesco Slovakia in 1996 as part of Tesco&#x27;s international expansion aims. It now operates from 123 stores. Tesco Slovakia has recently put great emphasis on organic products. However, Tesco Slovakia caused controversy amongst the Slovak government when it was found to have come foul of food safety laws in 2006. In April 2010 the first Tesco Extra in Central Europe opened in Bratislava – Petržalka, Slovakia as part of a pilot project for Tesco in the region, including the first self-service cash flow in Central Europe. There are currently six Tesco Extra stores in Slovakia – three in Bratislava and one each in Zvolen, Trnava and Košice.

=== Ireland ===

Tesco first operated in the Irish grocery market in the early 1980s, selling its operations there in March 1986. Tesco re-entered the Irish market in 1997 after the purchase of Power Supermarkets Ltd. It now operates from 154 stores across Ireland. Like Tesco stores in the UK, these offer a home delivery shopping service available to 80% of the Irish population as well as petrol, mobile telephone, personal finance, flower delivery service, and a weight-loss programme. Tesco&#x27;s loyalty programme, Clubcard, is offered in the country. Tesco had approximately 21% of the Irish grocery market in 2019 and its main competitors are Dunnes Stores and SuperValu.

Tesco Ireland claims to be the largest purchaser of Irish food with an estimated €1.5 billion annually. Tesco Ireland operates a number of Tesco Extra hypermarkets in Ireland, with Clarehall Extra on the Malahide Road being the first to open in 2006. Tesco&#x27;s largest hypermarket store in Europe, with a floorspace of , opened in Dundalk in County Louth in November 2010.

=== Spain, Portugal, and Gibraltar ===
Tesco supplies six stores in Spain, Portugal, and Gibraltar that operate under the name The Food Company. Operations started in 2019 with the first store opening in Puerto de Mazarrón located in the Murcia province of Spain. One other store opened in the Algarve, Portugal in 2019 followed by four more in 2020, in Gibraltar, Ibiza, Mijas (Málaga), and Quesada (Alicante). All 7,500 products stocked originate from Britain. The Web site stated in 2020 &quot;With more stores coming in Spain &amp; Portugal&quot;, but had not been updated .

=== India ===
Tesco has had a limited presence in India with a service centre in Bangalore, and outsourcing. In 2008 Tesco announced its intention to invest an initial £60m (US$115m) to open a wholesale cash-and-carry business based in Mumbai with the assistance of the Tata Group. In 2014, the joint venture between Tesco and Tata was confirmed, where investment by the earlier was reportedly 140 million dollars, thus becoming the first foreign supermarket to enter the country. The stores operate under the banner Star Bazaar and Star Daily supermarkets.

=== Pakistan ===

On 16 February 2017 Tesco announced a wholesale partnership with Limestone Private Limited, owner of the Alpha Superstores chain. This involved an exclusive partnership which would see Tesco products stocked across Alpha Supermarket stores within Pakistan.

==Former international operations==
=== China ===
Tesco acquired a 50% stake in the Hymall chain, from Ting Hsin in September 2004. In December 2006 it raised its stake to 90% in a £180 million deal. Most of Tesco China&#x27;s stores were based around Shanghai. Tesco had a large store in Weifang, Shandong province, and a further two-floor store in Taizhou, Jiangsu province. Tesco had been increasing its own brand products into the Chinese market as well as introducing the Tesco Express format. In May 2014 Tesco made a deal with the state-run China Resources Enterprise (CRE) to create a joint venture, combining Tesco&#x27;s 131 stores in the country with CRE&#x27;s nearly 3,000 outlets. With Tesco owning 20% of the business and CRE 80% this became the largest food retailer in China. In February 2020, Tesco announced that it would exit the China market by selling the 20% stake to CRE for £275 million.

=== France ===
Tesco owned a French food retailer called Catteau between 1993 and 1997, which operated a chain of 92 stores in NE France under the Cedico, Hyper Cedico, and Cedimarche banners. Tesco also operated a &quot;Vin Plus&quot; outlet in Calais, selling wine, beer, and spirits, which closed on 30 August 2010, due to the decline of the booze cruise.

=== Japan ===
Tesco Japan first began operations in 2003. It was brought about by a buy-out of C Two stores for £139 million in July 2003 and later Fre&#x27;c in April 2004. Tesco has adopted an approach that focuses on small corner shops that operate similarly to its Express format, rather than opening hypermarkets. It has also launched its range of software in Japan. In August 2011, Tesco announced that it was selling its Japanese stores to ÆON after revealing that only half of the stores in the Greater Tokyo Area were making a profit. Market share in the country was never above 1 percent.

=== Malaysia ===
Tesco opened its first store in Malaysia in May 2002 with the opening of its first hypermarket in Puchong, Selangor. Tesco Malaysia currently operates 49 Tesco and Tesco Extra stores. Tesco has partnered with local conglomerate Sime Darby Berhad, which holds 30% of the shares. In April 2013, Tesco Malaysia launched the Grocery Home Shopping Service, where it delivered groceries ordered via the Internet to consumers, with no minimum purchase imposed. The Malaysian operation of Tesco also included a convenience store, Tesco Pernama Ekspres, which began operation in February 2015. In 2020, Tesco agreed to sell its Malaysian business to the Thailand-based, Charoen Pokphand Group for US$10.6bn, including debt. With this sale having been completed, Tesco has now changed its name to Lotus&#x27;s.

=== Poland ===

Tesco entered the Polish market in 1995 acquiring local Polish supermarket chains- Minor, Madex, and Savia, and opened its first hypermarket in Wrocław Bielany in 1998. At the height of its operations in Poland the company operated from over 450 various format stores as well as an online shopping service. Tesco Poland offered a broad range of brands on the Polish market including its own branded line of products as well as regional produce, petrol, personal finance services and on-line photo processing. In August 2008 Tesco opened the first Extra store in Poland located in Częstochowa. In November 2019, having suffered years of net losses and despite extensive cost-cutting and attempts at streamlining of its business model, Tesco announced its intent to sell all of its operations in Poland. In 2020 Tesco Poland was bought by Salling Group. The last remaining stores closed down on 28 October 2021.

=== South Korea ===

Tesco launched its South Korean operations as &quot;Homeplus&quot; in 1999 and partnered with Samsung. Tesco held 94% of the shares in the venture. It was the second largest retailer in South Korea, just behind Shinsegae Group. On 14 May 2008, Tesco agreed to purchase 36 hypermarkets with a combination of food and non-food products from E-Land for $1.9 billion (£976 million) in its biggest single acquisition, making Tesco the second largest in the country. The majority of the E-Land stores formerly belonged to French retailer Carrefour before 2006 and most of the stores will be converted to Home plus outlets. Tesco&#x27;s South Korean discount store chain, Home Plus, currently has 66 outlets. In September 2015 the company was sold to MBK Partners, a South Korean buyout firm, which partnered with a Canadian pension fund and Singapore&#x27;s Temasek Holdings in a transaction worth 4.2 billion pounds.

=== Thailand ===

Tesco entered Thailand in 1998 and operates through 380 stores as part of a joint venture with Charoen Pokphand and named the operation &quot;Tesco Lotus&quot;. This partnership was dissolved in 2003 when Charoen Pokphand sold its shares to Tesco. Tesco Lotus claims to serve 20 million customers every month and that 97% of its goods are sourced from Thailand. By March 2013, Thailand operations were generating £3 billion in revenues and were one of the company&#x27;s largest businesses outside of the UK. Tesco agreed to sell its Thai business to Charoen Pokphand Group for $10.6bn, including debt. A transaction that would be expected to be completed in the second half of 2020. With this sale having been completed, Tesco Lotus has now changed its name to Lotus&#x27;s.

=== Turkey ===

Tesco entered the Turkish market in 2003 and uses the trading name &quot;Tesco Kipa&quot;. Tesco remains focused on building infrastructure in Turkey to complete its expansion plans and introduced the Tesco Express format into Turkey in 2006. There are plans to increase the rate of expansion as basic infrastructure is built. In June 2016, Tesco announced that it would sell its Turkish stores to its competitor, Migros Türk.

=== United States ===

Tesco entered the United States grocery market in 2007 through the opening of a new chain of convenience stores, named Fresh &amp; Easy, on the West Coast (Arizona, California, and Nevada). The company established its U.S. headquarters in El Segundo, California, and the first store opened in Hemet, California in November 2007, with 100 more planned in the first year; a store opening every two-and-a-half days. It announced the sale of 150 of the stores in the 200-strong chain to private equity firm Yucaipa Companies in September 2013. The BBC reported that the remaining stores were expected to close. The deal included Tesco loaning the venture £80m and retaining an option to buy back a stake in the business if Yucaipa succeeded in turning around the group&#x27;s performance. The last Fresh &amp; Easy store closed in 2015.

==Corporate affairs==

===Corporate strategy===

According to Citigroup retail analyst David McCarthy, &quot;[Tesco has] pulled off a trick that I&#x27;m not aware of any other retailer achieving. That is to appeal to all segments of the market&quot;. One plank of this strategy has been Tesco&#x27;s use of its own-brand products, including the upmarket &quot;Finest&quot;, mid-range Tesco brand and low-price &quot;Value&quot; encompassing several product categories such as food, beverage, home, clothing, Tesco Mobile and financial services. Tesco have two vegan ranges branded &quot;Plant Chef&quot; and &quot;Wicked Kitchen&quot;.

Beginning in 1997 when Terry Leahy took over as CEO, Tesco began marketing itself using the phrase &quot;The Tesco Way&quot; to describe the company&#x27;s core purposes, values, principles, and goals This phrase became the standard marketing speak for Tesco as it expanded domestically and internationally under Leahy&#x27;s leadership, implying a shift by the company to focus on people, both customers, and employees.

A core part of the Tesco expansion strategy has been its innovative use of technology. It was one of the first to build self-service tills and use cameras to reduce queues, and an early adopter of NFC contactless payment card technology. In 2016, Tesco developed a mobile payment wallet, PayQwiq using both NFC contactless and barcode technology to allow payment using mobile phones in-shop (along with supporting other contactless mobile wallets such as ApplePay).

===Financial performance===
All figures below are for the Tesco financial years, which run for 52- or 53-week periods to late February.

Despite being in a recession, Tesco made record profits for a British retailer in the year to February 2010, during which its underlying pre-tax profits increased by 10.1% to £3.4 billion. Tesco then planned to create 16,000 new jobs, 9,000 in the UK. In 2011 the retailer reported its poorest six-monthly UK sales figures for 20 years, attributed to consumers&#x27; reduced non-food spending and a growth in budget rivals.

By 2014, Tesco appeared to have lost some of its appeal to customers. The share price lost 49 per cent of its value up to October as it struggled to fend off competition from rivals Aldi and Lidl. In October 2014, Tesco suspended 8 executives following its announcement the previous month that it had previously overstated its profits by £250 million. The misreporting resulted in almost £2.2 billion being wiped off the value of the company&#x27;s stock market value. The suspended executives included former commercial director Kevin Grace and UK managing director Chris Bush. The profit overstatement was subsequently revised upwards to £263 million following an investigation by the accountancy firm Deloitte, and it was clarified that the inflated profit figure was the result of Tesco bringing forward rebates from suppliers. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) confirmed on 29 October 2014 that it was carrying out a criminal investigation into the accounting irregularities but declined to give further details. As a result, Tesco agreed to pay a fine and compensation. Three executives charged with fraud and false accounting in connection with the misreporting were cleared of the charges in 2018–2019.

===Market share===
According to Kantar Worldpanel, Tesco&#x27;s share of the UK groceries market in the 12 weeks to 26 January 2025 was 28.5%, up from 27.8% in the 12 weeks to 28 January 2024.

In terms of the wider UK retail market, Tesco sales account for around one pound in every ten spent in British shops. In 2007 it was reported that its share was even larger, with one pound in every seven spent going to Tesco. In 2006, Inverness was branded as &quot;Tescotown&quot;, because well over 50p in every £1 spent on food is believed to be spent in its three Tesco shops. By 2014 competition from other retailers led to a fall in Tesco&#x27;s market share to 28.7%; this was the lowest level in a decade.

===Corporate social responsibility===
Tesco made a commitment to corporate social responsibility in the form of contributions of 1.87% in 2006 of its pre-tax profits to charities and local community organisations. This compares favourably with Marks &amp; Spencer, whose 1.51% is lower than Sainsbury&#x27;s 7.02%. This figure, £42 million is lower than the amount of money reported to have been avoided in tax during 2007 (see below). Will Hutton, in his role as chief executive of The Work Foundation, in 2007 praised Tesco for leading the debate on corporate responsibility. However &quot;Intelligent Giving&quot; has criticised the company for directing all &quot;staff giving&quot; support to the company&#x27;s Charity of the Year.

In 1992, Tesco started a &quot;computers for schools scheme&quot;, offering computers in return for vouchers given to Tesco customers and donated by them to schools and hospitals. Until 2004, £92 million of equipment went to these organisations. The scheme was also implemented in Poland.

In 2009, Tesco used the phrase, &quot;Change for Good&quot; as advertising, which is trademarked by Unicef for charity usage but not for commercial or retail use, which prompted the agency to say, &quot;It is the first time in Unicef&#x27;s history that a commercial entity has purposely set out to capitalise on one of our campaigns and subsequently damage an income stream which several of our programmes for children are dependent on.&quot; It went on to call on the public &quot;...who have children&#x27;s welfare at heart, to consider carefully who they support when making consumer choices.&quot;

Tesco&#x27;s own-labels personal care and household products are stated to be cruelty-free, meaning that they are not tested on animals.

In June 2011, Tesco announced that it was working with 2degrees Network to create an online hub as part of its target to reduce its supply chain carbon footprint by 30% by 2020.

In September 2011, a Greenpeace report revealed that Tesco supermarkets in China were selling vegetables that contained pesticides at levels exceeding the legal limit, or were illegal. A green vegetable sample from Tesco turned up methamidophos and monocrotophos, the use of which has been prohibited in China since the beginning of 2007.

==Advertising==

A notable 1980s advert was &quot;Checkout 82,&quot; which was made in 1982, where a till would have a receipt coming out of it with the prices on. This advert had synthpop music as the backing and people singing &quot;Check it out, check it out&quot;.

Adverts in the early 1990s had a man called David, portrayed by Dudley Moore, on the hunt for free-range chickens from France and discovering many goods from around the world to purchase for Tesco. Late 2000s adverts included many celebrities and celebrity voice-overs such as The Spice Girls and the voice of actors James Nesbitt and Jane Horrocks.

Tesco&#x27;s main advertising slogan is &quot;Every little helps&quot;. Its advertisements in print and on television mainly consist of product shots (or an appropriate image, such as a car when advertising petrol) against a white background, with a price or appropriate text (e.g., &quot;Tesco Value&quot;) superimposed on a red circle.

Tesco&#x27;s in-shop magazine is one of the largest-circulation magazines in the United Kingdom, with a circulation of 1.9 million .

In November 2013, Tesco announced it would introduce face-scanning technology developed by Amscreen at all of its 450 UK petrol stations to target advertisements to individual customers.

==Criticism==
Criticism of Tesco includes allegations of stifling competition due to its undeveloped &quot;land bank&quot;, and breaching planning laws.

===Litigation===
The Tesco supermarket chain is involved in litigation such as the &quot;Ward v Tesco Stores Ltd&quot; and &quot;Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass&quot; cases. Tesco has been criticised for aggressively pursuing critics of the company in Thailand. Writer and former MP Jit Siratranont faced up to two years in jail and a £16.4 million libel damages claim for saying that Tesco was expanding aggressively at the expense of small local retailers. Tesco served him with writs for criminal defamation and civil libel. The Thai court dismissed the case, ruling that the criticism made by the defendant was &#x27;in good faith by way of fair comment on any person or thing subjected to public criticism&#x27;.

In November 2007, Tesco sued a Thai academic and a former minister for civil libel and criminal defamation, insisting that the two pay £1.6 million and £16.4 million and receive two years&#x27; imprisonment respectively. They have been alleged to have misstated that Tesco&#x27;s Thai market amounts to 37% of its global revenues, amongst criticism of Tesco&#x27;s propensity to put small retailers out of business.

In August 2013, Tesco was fined £300,000 after admitting that it misled customers over the pricing of &quot;half-price&quot; strawberries.
===Animal welfare===
Tesco has received criticism for supplying meat from intensive animal farms.

In September 2019, footage shot at a self-described &quot;ethical&quot; farm that supplied Tesco showed birds being kicked and hurled into crates.

In September 2020, an investigation into a chicken farm that supplied Tesco found fast-growing birds that were in chronic pain and others that could barely stand up.

In May 2021, undercover footage captured showed piglets deemed too small or too weak for the abattoir being hammered to death by farm workers or being swung against a concrete floor to be killed at a Tesco supplier. The practice, known as piglet thumping, is common on UK farms.

In July 2021, The Independent revealed chickens were being left to die of thirst in overcrowded sheds by a Tesco supplier. Some birds resorted to cannibalism, and many suffered ammonia burns.

=== Use of caged eggs ===
In May 2019 an undercover investigation of an Asian Tesco egg supplier, released by the Daily Mirror, found Tesco is serving Asian customers eggs from battery cage farms. In August 2019, an investigation of the company producing Tesco&#x27;s own-brand eggs in Malaysia, broken by the New Straits Times, documented similar conditions. In response to the investigation, Tesco committed to using only cage-free eggs in Thailand and Malaysia.

===Price-fixing===
In 2007, Tesco was placed under investigation by the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) for acting as part of a cartel of five supermarkets (Safeway, Tesco, Asda, Morrisons, and Sainsburys) and a number of dairy companies to fix the price of milk, butter, and cheese. In December 2007, Asda, Sainsbury&#x27;s, and the former Safeway admitted that they acted covertly against the interests of consumers while publicly claiming that they were supporting 5,000 farmers recovering from the foot-and-mouth crisis. They were fined a total of £116 million.

===Corporate tax structure===
In May 2007, it was reported that Tesco had moved the head office of its online operations to Switzerland. This allows it to sell CDs, DVDs, and electronic games through its website without charging value-added tax (VAT). The operation had previously been run from Jersey but had been closed by authorities who feared damage to the island&#x27;s reputation.

In June 2008, the government announced that it was closing a tax loophole being used by Tesco. The scheme, identified by British magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;, utilised offshore holding companies in Luxembourg and partnership agreements to reduce corporation tax liability by up to £50 million a year. Another scheme previously identified by &quot;Private Eye&quot; involved depositing £1 billion in a Swiss partnership, and then loaning that money to overseas Tesco shops, so that profit could be transferred indirectly through interest payments. This scheme was still in operation and was estimated to be costing the UK exchequer up to £20 million a year in corporation tax. Tax expert Richard Murphy has provided an analysis of this avoidance structure.

Tax avoidance has not always been related to corporation tax. A number of companies including Tesco used a scheme to avoid VAT by deeming 2.5% of purchases paid for by card to be a &#x27;card transaction fee&#x27;, which reduced the company&#x27;s tax liability without changing the charge to the customer. Such schemes came to light after HMRC litigated against Debenhams over the scheme in 2005.

===Opposition to expansion===
Tesco&#x27;s expansion has been criticised, and in some cases actively opposed;
* Plans for a large Tesco shop in St Albans, Hertfordshire, attracted widespread local opposition. This led to the formation of the &quot;Stop St Albans Tesco Group&quot;. In June 2008, St Albans Council refused planning permission for the proposed new shop.
* In April 2011, longstanding opposition to a Tesco Express shop in Cheltenham Road, Stokes Croft, Bristol, evolved into a violent clash between opponents and police. The recently opened shopfront was heavily damaged, and police reported the seizure of petrol bombs. Opponents have suggested that the shop would damage small shops and harm the character of the area.
* In March 2015 an arson attack gutted a new Tesco Express shop in Godalming, Surrey, two days before it was due to open. Tesco had purchased a public house and converted it into the new store, a change which did not require planning permission, thus denying the vigorous local opposition any formal means of preventing it. After continuing local opposition, including the local MP and borough council, Tesco abandoned its plans for the shop in January 2017.

===Horse meat found in burgers===

In January 2013, the British media reported that horse meat had been found in some meat products sold by Tesco, along with other retailers, particularly burgers. Prime Minister David Cameron called this &quot;unacceptable&quot;, with products showing 29.1% horse meat in the &quot;Value&quot; range burger, which were supposed to be beef. It was later revealed in February 2013 that some of Tesco&#x27;s Everyday Value Spaghetti Bolognese contained 60% horse meat. Tesco withdrew 26 of its products in response and announced that it was working with authorities and the supplier to investigate the cause of the contamination.

===Guide dogs===
Following a 2013 incident when the manager of Tesco in Sutton ordered a blind person and her guide dog to leave the shop, Tesco stated that its staff had received training to ensure that such an incident would not happen again. In 2014, Tesco staff shouted at a customer with a guide dog and told her not to return to the store. Tesco later said: &quot;This clearly should never have happened and we will contact Ms Makri directly to apologise. We do allow guide dogs in stores and have reminded colleagues of that&quot; and donated £5,000 to a guide dogs charity.

===Slavery in Thailand===
In 2014, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Tesco is a client of Charoen Pokphand Foods. Over six months &quot;The Guardian&quot; traced the whole chain from slave ships in Asian waters to leading producers and retailers.

===Sale of goods from Israel===
Tesco has been targeted by protesters complaining the supermarket chain sells goods made in Israel, with most complaints being about products emanating from Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Protests generally occur when Israeli military operations are being carried out in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank. A protester was arrested at a protest at a shop in Birmingham on 16 August 2014.

===Sale of anti-semitic books===
In 2005, &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine said it was &quot;horrified&quot; to discover anti-semitic books by US extremist publisher Liberty Bell on the Tesco website. Titles offered for sale included &quot;The Hitler We Loved and Why&quot;, &quot;The International Jew&quot;, and &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;. &quot;Searchlight&quot; found another 106 titles by British-based publisher Steven Books which it describes as &quot;so extreme that even the British National Party does not sell them&quot;. The shop said in a statement: &quot;Tesco.com has over one million book titles covering a wide range of subjects. We are unhappy that titles which could cause offence to some customers have found their way on to our site and took immediate action to remove them once they were brought to our attention.&quot;

===Suppliers===
The UK Groceries Code Adjudicator found in a 2015–16 investigation into Tesco that some suppliers paid &quot;large sums of money in exchange for category captaincy or participation in a price review&quot;. She found some evidence of benefits which suppliers derive from these arrangements but also recorded a concern—to be investigated further—as to whether the purpose of the Groceries Code was being circumvented by these payments.

===Amazon rainforest deforestation===
In June 2021 there were protests outside Tesco Headquarters in Welwyn Garden City due to the involvement of Tesco in deforestation and forest fires in Brazil, as this is where Tesco sources the soy used to feed livestock for its meat produce.

===Allegation of xenophobia===
On 21 November 2020, a member of the Romanian diaspora in the United Kingdom said that in the Telford store there was a warning for shoplifters written in Romanian that said &quot;notice for store thieves, you will be legally prosecuted if caught stealing&quot;. The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MAE) expressed its &quot;surprise and disagreement against the strongly discriminating message&quot;.

===Partnership with Usdaw===
The relationship between the trade union Usdaw and Tesco management, has been met with criticism, with the union seemingly presenting itself as being concerned more with maintaining its positive, comfortable position and easy membership supply than that of fair representation of its members, earning the union the pejorative backronym of &quot;Useless Seven Days A Week&quot; amongst workers and trade unionists.

=== E.Coli Cases ===
In June 2024, legal firm Fieldfisher said on Friday it had issued letters of claim for breach of the Consumer Protection Act over own-brand sandwiches purchased in Tesco and Asda. The claims for compensation relate to a man from the South East and an 11-year-old girl in the North West.

<text>William Barclay Parsons (April 15, 1859 – May 9, 1932) was an American civil engineer. He founded Parsons Brinckerhoff, one of the largest American civil engineering firms.

==Personal life==
Parsons was the son of William Barclay Parsons (1828–1887) and Eliza Glass Livingston Parsons (1831–1922). His siblings included Schuyler (1852–1917), Harry (1862–1935), and George (1863–1939). His maternal grandparents were Ann Eliza (née Hosie) Livingston (1805–1838) and Schuyler Livingston (1804–1861), a descendant of Walter Livingston who ran a line of clipper ships from the New York harbor named Barclay &amp; Livingston. His paternal grandparents were William Burrington Parsons (1794–1869) and Anne Barclay Parsons (1788–1869). He was the great-grandson of Henry Barclay, second Rector of Trinity Church in Manhattan.

In 1871, he went to school in Torquay, England, and studied under private tutors for four years while traveling in France, Germany, and Italy. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Columbia College of Columbia University in 1879, and a second from the Columbia School of Mines in 1882. He served as class president and president of the Philolexian Society, and he co-founded the &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot; in 1877. He later served as chairman of the university&#x27;s board of trustees.

Parsons married Anna Dewitt Reed (1858–1958) on May 20, 1884. (She was the daughter of Rev. Sylvanus Reed (1821–1870) and Caroline Gallup Reed (1821–1914). Her brother Sylvanus was the aerospace engineer who developed the modern metal aircraft propeller.) Their children were Sylvia (1885–1962), who married Rudolph Weld (1883–1941) in 1908, and William (1888–1973), who married Rose Peabody (1891–1985), daughter of Endicott Peabody (1857–1944).

Parsons died on May 9, 1932, in New York City.

==Career==
Parsons worked for the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad from 1882 through 1885. He wrote &quot;Turnouts; Exact Formulae for Their Determination&quot; (1884) and &quot;Track, A Complete Manual of Maintenance of Way&quot; (1886) which both addressed railroad problems, and this interest in rail transportation continued throughout his life.

Parsons designed the Cape Cod Canal as Chief Engineer. He was also Chief Engineer of the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners and was responsible for the construction of the Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT) subway line. He left New York in October 1886 to serve as Chief Engineer for the Fort Worth and Rio Grande Railroad, although he retained his affiliation with the District Railway Company. In 1887, he became the Chief Engineer and General Manager of the Denver Railroad and Land and Coal Company. He returned to New York in 1891 upon the completion of these railway projects and a number of water-work ventures in Mississippi.

Parsons was appointed to the Isthmian Canal Commission in 1904 by President Theodore Roosevelt. He was also appointed to the advisory board which provided technical advice to the Royal Commission on London Traffic in 1904, along with Sir Benjamin Baker and Sir John Wolfe-Barry, both British civil engineers. In early 1905, he traveled to Panama as a member of the committee of engineers which favored a sea-level canal.

* Parsons was the Colonel of the 11th Engineers of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) in France during World War I. He was with a team of engineers in Battle of Cambrai that was suddenly attacked by Germans while making railroad repairs; the engineers fought back with picks and shovels. He was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal for &quot;specially meritorious services&quot; and received decorations from Great Britain, France, Belgium, and the state of New York. The citation for his Army DSM reads:

<text>Route 4 is a state highway in Bergen County and Passaic County, United States. The highway stretches from Route 20 (McLean Boulevard) in Paterson east to an interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95), U.S. Route 1/9 (US 1/9), US 46, and US 9W at the George Washington Bridge approach in Fort Lee.

The route is a four- to six-lane divided highway its entire length, with the portion east of the Route 208 interchange in Fair Lawn an arterial road consisting of interchanges and right-in/right-out intersections with many businesses along the road, particularly in Paramus, where the route passes through a major shopping area consisting of numerous malls, Hackensack, Englewood, and Fort Lee. Route 4 intersects many important roads, including Route 208 in Fair Lawn and the Garden State Parkway and Route 17 in Paramus. It also serves as a northern alternative to Interstate 80 between Paterson and the George Washington Bridge. The highway is officially named the Mackay Highway, but is rarely referred to as such.

Originally legislated to traverse the state from Cape May to the George Washington Bridge, Route 4 was heavily reduced to its current alignment in 1953. Today&#x27;s stretch of the route was completed by 1934; the state planned to upgrade it to a freeway, but plans never materialized. Despite this, the route has seen improvements, such as to the interchanges with Route 17 in 1999 and with Route 208 in 2002.

Route 4 is a heavily used commuter, retail, and long-distance artery. As well as providing a critical commuter route from the Hudson Valley and Bergen County into New York City via the George Washington Bridge, it gives New Yorkers access to popular shopping areas such as Garden State Plaza and Bergen Town Center, and forms part of the straightest route from New York City and Long Island to Upstate and Western New York destinations. Locally, especially west of the Hackensack River, it is seen as a socioeconomic dividing line between wealthier, more affluent suburbs like Ridgewood and Oradell to the north, and more urbanized, industrialized, working-class areas like Hackensack to the south.

==Route description==

Route 4 starts in Paterson, Passaic County, at the intersection of Broadway and East 43rd Street at an interchange with Route 20 (McLean Boulevard), heading east on Broadway, a four-lane arterial road with a Jersey barrier. The route passes over Route 20 and continues east, crossing the Passaic River into Elmwood Park, Bergen County and passing over County Route 507 (CR 507). Route 4 features a right-in/right-out in the eastbound direction that provides access to CR 507. The route continues east on Broadway as a boulevard with a concrete then a grassy median, with businesses lining both sides of the roadway. At the intersection with Cyril Avenue, Route 4 runs along the border of Elmwood Park to the south and Fair Lawn to the north before entirely entering Fair Lawn, where the route passes under NJ Transit’s Bergen County Line near Broadway station. It intersects CR 67 (Midland Avenue) and continues east as an arterial road with a Jersey barrier through commercial areas of Fair Lawn.

Route 4 comes to an interchange Route 208, where the route continues east on the Route 208 alignment, as a divided highway with four lanes in the eastbound direction and three lanes in the westbound direction. The interchange between Route 4 and Route 208 also features access to CR 79 (Saddle River Road). The route continues east as a six-lane arterial that is lined with businesses. Route 4 crosses the Saddle River and then enters Paramus. Upon entering Paramus, Route 4 has a cloverleaf interchange with CR 62 (Paramus Road/Passaic Street). The route features a partial interchange with the Garden State Parkway, with access from westbound Route 4 to the southbound Garden State Parkway and from the northbound Garden State Parkway to eastbound Route 4. Route 4 has an interchange which provides access to the Westfield Garden State Plaza shopping mall, located on the south side of the road, and a large IKEA store, located on the north side of the road. Past this, Route 4 features a cloverleaf interchange with Route 17 and continues east as a six-lane arterial. It interchanges with Spring Valley Road and passes by Bergen Town Center located on the south side of the road. Route 4 interchanges with CR 59 (Forest Avenue/Maywood Avenue).

As the road leaves Paramus, businesses no longer line the route. Route 4 enters River Edge, where the route crosses Van Saun Mill Creek, and it heads to the southeast and features ramps that provide access to CR 51 (Kinderkamack Road), which the route passes over along with NJ Transit&#x27;s Pascack Valley Line just south of the New Bridge Landing station. Upon crossing the Pascack Valley Line, Route 4 heads into Hackensack, where it interchanges with CR 503 (Hackensack Avenue) near The Shops at Riverside. The route crosses the Hackensack River into Teaneck and heads through the campus of Fairleigh Dickinson University, becoming a six-lane freeway. Route 4 features ramps that provide access to CR 41 (River Road), which it later passes over. The road continues southeast through wooded residential areas, intersecting a few roads at right-in/right-out intersections, before passing over CSX&#x27;s River Subdivision line and reaching an interchange with Queen Anne Road. It interchanges with CR 39 (Teaneck Road) and Webster Avenue/Farragut Drive before crossing into Englewood where the route crosses Overpeck Creek and reverts to a six-lane arterial road with access to businesses and a few local roads provided by right-in/right-out ramps. In Englewood, Route 4 passes over CSX&#x27;s Northern Branch rail line. Nearby is a cloverleaf interchange with Route 93 and CR 501 (Grand Avenue). Past this interchange, businesses stop along the road and it continues east with three lanes in the eastbound direction and two lanes in the westbound direction, coming to an interchange with Jones Road. Past this interchange, the road continues south with businesses along the road, crossing into Fort Lee. In Fort Lee, the lanes split as Route 4 approaches I-95, with the eastbound lanes passing over I-95. Route 4 continues south with I-95 in the median, ending at an interchange with I-95, US 1/9, US 46, and US 9W, at the George Washington Bridge approach.

==History==

Route 4 was originally legislated in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering to run from Cape May north to the George Washington Bridge, running through Pleasantville, Toms River, Freehold, Perth Amboy, Rahway, and Paterson. The route replaced portions of the alignments of several pre-1927 state highways including Route 14 (chartered 1917) between Cape May and Seaville, Route 19 between Seaville and Absecon (c. 1923, never realized), Route 4 (c. 1916) between Absecon and Lakewood and between South Amboy and Rahway, a spur of Route 7 (c. 1925) between Lakewood and Freehold. US 9 was also designated along Route 4 between Absecon and Lakewood and from South Amboy to Rahway. By the 1940s, US 9 was realigned to follow Route 4 between Lakewood and South Amboy, having followed portions of today’s Route 88, Route 35, and Route 71 and was extended south along Route 4 to Cape May. The section of present-day Route 4 was built beginning 1930 to connect Paterson and the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, and was completed and opened July 28, 1932. There were plans made in 1936 to make this portion of Route 4 a limited-access highway; however, World War II delayed plans for the expressway.

By Joint Resolution No. 11, approved June 8, 1935, the New Jersey Legislature designated Route 4 as the Mackay Highway. William B. Mackay, Jr., a Republican from Bergen County, had served in the New Jersey State Senate from 1917 to 1928. Afterwards he served as judge of the Passaic circuit of the New Jersey Supreme Court.
Route 4 had several former spur routes that existed prior to the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. Route 4N was designated in 1939 from the portion of pre-1927 Route 4 between Brielle and Eatontown; it is now Route 71. Route S4 was defined in 1927 to run to the Outerbridge Crossing in Perth Amboy from present-day Route 35; it was eventually extended to the Garden State Parkway and this route is now Routes 440 and 184. Route S4A was planned in 1927 to run from Atlantic City across swamps to Tuckerton; only a small portion of this route was built and it is now Route 87. Route S4B was planned in 1929 to run from Route 4 near Paterson northwest to the New York border, replacing a portion of what was legislated as Route 3 in 1927. The portion of this route that was built between Fair Lawn and Oakland is now Route 208. Route S4D was a never built spur in Teaneck proposed in 1938; the proposal was renumbered Route 303. Route 4A was created by the 1940s following a realignment of Route 4 (and US 9) between Freehold and Cheesequake; it became Route 79 and a portion of Route 34 in 1953. Route 4 Parkway was planned in 1946 as a north–south parkway running from Cape May north to Route 6 (now US 46) in Clifton, bridging the gap that existed along Route 4 between Rahway and Paterson; this proposal became Route 444 (Garden State Parkway). Route S4C was a planned route running from Route 4 in Bennett south to Cape May; the general alignment of this route is now Route 162 and Cape May County Route 626.
In the 1953 renumbering, Route 4 was defined to run along its current alignment between Route 20 in Paterson and the George Washington Bridge. Between Cape May and South Amboy, the Route 4 designation was dropped in favor of US 9 while the portion of the route between South Amboy and Rahway became a part of Route 35. In the mid-1950s, plans resumed for an east–west limited-access highway through Bergen County. Three alignments were proposed in 1956: one along Route 4, one along US 46, and one in between the two routes. The alignment between the two routes was chosen due to the least disruption it would cause and it was built as I-80. In the 1960s, recommendations were made to upgrade Route 4 to a freeway but was cancelled due to feared disruption to residents.

Many improvements have been made to the existing Route 4 arterial. The Route 17 interchange in Paramus was rebuilt at a cost of $120 million in 1999, replacing the 1932 cloverleaf interchange by adding several flyover ramps. In 2002, construction was completed on a $32 million project that improved the interchange with Route 208 in Fair Lawn. This interchange saw improvements of the ramps and bridges, including the Route 208 bridge over Saddle River Road.

<text>Route 20, known locally as McLean Boulevard, is a state highway that runs 4.15 miles (6.68 km) in New Jersey, United States. It runs along the east side of Paterson, Passaic County, following the west bank of the Passaic River between U.S. Route 46 and River Street (County Route 504), at which point County Route 504 begins. It is a four- to six-lane divided highway for most of its length that runs through residential and commercial areas of Paterson, intersecting with Interstate 80 and Route 4 at interchanges. The northernmost part of the route is a county-maintained one-way pair that follows 1st and 2nd Avenues.

== Route description ==

Route 20 begins at an interchange with U.S. Route 46 and County Route 630 (Crooks Avenue) just north of the Garden State Parkway on the border of Clifton and Paterson. The road follows the bend of the Passaic River directly north of Dundee Lake, heading to the north into Paterson as McLean Boulevard, a four-lane freeway. The route runs in between the Passaic River to the east and two large cemeteries to the west before coming to an interchange with Interstate 80 and Market Street. Past Interstate 80, Route 20 becomes a six-lane arterial road that heads under New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway&#x27;s New Jersey Subdivision line and through a mix of residential and commercial areas.
The next interchange along the route is for Route 4 (Broadway), with access to both eastbound Route 4 and westbound Broadway from both directions. The road continues further north as a four-lane arterial road, heading through more urbanized areas of Paterson. It crosses County Route 651 (East 33rd Street/Morlot Avenue), which crosses the Passaic River to become County Route 78 (Morlot Avenue) in Bergen County.

Route 20 continues to follow the Passaic River as a road through commercial areas, featuring an intersection with County Route 652 (5th Avenue). Past this intersection, the route proceeds through urban areas, turning west and splitting into a one-way pair. Here, the route becomes county maintained, with the northbound direction following 1st Avenue and the southbound direction following 2nd Avenue before continuing west as County Route 504 (River Street).

==History==

The present-day routing of Route 20 north of Market Street was legislated in 1927 as part of Route 3, which was to run from the New York border at Greenwood Lake to Secaucus. In addition, the present day routing south of Route 4 was also legislated as part of that route, which was to run from the George Washington Bridge to Cape May. In 1929, the western terminus of Route 3 was moved to Paterson as Route S4B (now Route 208) was planned to replace the alignment of Route 3 from Paterson to the New York border. McLean Boulevard through Paterson was built by the 1930s. A new highway was to be built connecting the two, bypassing the Paterson Plank Road to the north. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 20 was legislated to follow the former alignment of Route 3 between Paterson and East Rutherford as Route 3 was moved to the Route S3 freeway that was built between East Rutherford and Clifton. By this point, the Paterson Plank Road was no longer in the state highway system.

Another freeway routing of Route 20 was planned in 1959. This road, which was to be a six-lane freeway called the Paterson Peripheral, was to run from Clifton north to the existing Route 20 in downtown Paterson. This road was completed between the Garden State Parkway and Valley Road by 1969 and north to Interstate 80 in 1975. Upon completion, this road received the Route 20 designation. In 1972, the state once again took over maintenance of the Paterson Plank Road from Route 3 to Route 17 in East Rutherford and made it a part of the route. As it became clear that these three sections of Route 20 would not be connected, especially after the designation of the Great Falls Historic District, they received three different route designations by the 1990s. The freeway section of Route 20 from the Garden State Parkway to Interstate 80 was designated Route 19, the section between Route 3 and Route 17 was designated Route 120, and the Route 20 designation was retained along McLean Boulevard through Paterson. The unfinished section of Route 20 that was to connect McLean Boulevard to Paterson Plank Road was built as a northern extension of the Route 21 freeway in 2000.

<doc id="98363" wikidata="Q1234405" url="?curid=98363" title="Fidenae">
<text>Fidenae () was an ancient town of Latium, situated about 8 km north of Rome on the &quot;Via Salaria&quot;. Its inhabitants were known as Fidenates. As the Tiber was the border between Etruria and Latium, the left-bank settlement of Fidenae represented an extension of Etruscan presence into Latium. The site of the arx of the ancient town was probably on the hill on which lies the contemporary Villa Spada, though no traces of early buildings or defences are to be seen; pre-Roman tombs are in the cliffs to the north. The later village lay at the foot of the hill on the eastern edge of the high-road, and its &quot;curia&quot;, with a dedicatory inscription to Marcus Aurelius by the &quot;Senatus Fidenatium&quot;, was excavated in 1889. Remains of other buildings may also be seen.
==History==

===Conflicts with the Roman kingdom===
Originally a settlement of Etruscans, it was at the frontier of Roman territory and occasionally changed hands between Rome and Veii.

In the 8th century BC during the reign of Rome&#x27;s first king, Romulus, the Fidenates and the Veientes were defeated in a war with Rome, according to legend. It may be that a colony was established there after the defeat as Livy afterwards describes Fidenae as a Roman colony.

Fidenae and Veii were defeated by Rome in the mid 7th century BC during the reign of Rome&#x27;s third king Tullus Hostilius, and again by Rome&#x27;s fifth king Tarquinius Priscus in the early 6th century BC.

===Conflicts with the Roman Republic===
In the early Roman Republic, Fidenae made a decision that was to cost them much of their land in favor of the new Claudia gens, formed from Sabine defectors. Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, last king of Rome, having been expelled from it, at first looked for intervention from the Etruscans. Lars Porsenna of Clusium, dissatisfied with Superbus&#x27; conduct and ethics, made peace with the new republic.

The Tarquins then subverted Latium. Sextus Tarquinius, whose rape of Lucretia had triggered the overthrow of the monarchy (if he was not assassinated at Gabii), convinced the Sabines to go to war against Rome, arguing that previous treaties had been annulled by the expulsion of the kings. The Tarquins were now interested in Latin intervention. After some minor conflicts in which Rome was victorious, the Sabines took a vote and resolved on an invasion of the city of Rome (with perhaps the previous example in memory). The Tarquins brought in Fidenae and Cameria, formerly Roman allies.

The total defeat of the Sabines in 505/504 BC was followed by the siege of Fidenae. The city was taken only a few days later: the Romans assembled their prisoners and executing the senior officers before them (whipped by the rods and beheaded by the axe of the fasces, a standard punishment for treason), let the rest go with a stern warning. A garrison was placed in Fidenae, and its members were given much of its land. The Claudii are not mentioned in connection with the battle, but they had been given land north of the Anio river, some of which was at Fidenae. They could only collect on that offer if Fidenae was defeated, the implication being that they were being invited to participate in the campaign; they may even have been the garrison.

Fidenae appears to have fallen permanently under Roman domination after its capture in 435 BC by the Romans, and is spoken of by classical authors as a place almost deserted in their time. It seems, however, to have had some importance as a post station.

===Stadium disaster===
In 27 AD, an apparently cheaply built wooden amphitheater constructed by an entrepreneur named Atilius collapsed in Fidenae, resulting in what was said to be the worst stadium disaster in history, with at least 20,000 killed and many more injured out of the total audience of 50,000.

The emperor Tiberius had banned gladiatorial games, and when the prohibition was lifted, the public had flocked to the earliest events, so a large crowd was present when the stadium collapsed. At the time of the incident, Tiberius was in Capri, where he had a secure getaway, but he rushed to Fidenae to assist the victims of this incident.

The Roman Senate responded to the tragedy by banning people with a fortune of less than 400,000 sesterces from hosting gladiator shows, and also requiring that all amphitheaters built in the future be erected on a sound foundation, inspected and certified for soundness. The government also &quot;banished&quot; Atilius.

A digital reconstruction found the reported casualties to be consistent with a wooden structure similar in size to the still-standing stone structure of the amphitheater in Verona.

<text>Route 19 is a state highway in Passaic County, New Jersey, United States. Also referred to as the Paterson Peripheral, it runs from an intersection with County Route 509 (CR 509, Broad Street) and CR 609 (Colfax Avenue) in Clifton north to another intersection with CR 509 (Main Street) in downtown Paterson. Between U.S. Route 46 (US 46) in Clifton and Interstate 80 (I-80) in Paterson, Route 19 is a freeway. The main purpose of the route is to connect the Garden State Parkway to I-80 and downtown Paterson. The road was originally proposed as the Paterson spur of the Garden State Parkway that was to run north to Wayne. In 1959, it was planned to become part of the Paterson Peripheral, an extension of Route 20 from downtown Paterson. By 1971, the road was completed between the Garden State Parkway and I-80, at which time it received the Route 20 designation; the rest was cancelled in 1978 due to feared community disruption. In 1988, this portion of Route 20 became Route 19 as it did not connect with the other segment of the route. In the 1990s, Route 19 was extended to Main Street in downtown Paterson as part of a project that also completed the interchange with I-80.

==Route description==

Route 19 begins at the intersection of CR 509 (Broad Street) and CR 609 (Colfax Avenue) in Clifton. From this intersection, it heads north concurrent with CR 509 as a four-lane freeway, soon interchanging with US 46. Past US 46, the road crosses a brook and CR 509 (Broad Street) splits off, with Route 19 interchanging with the Garden State Parkway. Route 19 continues past the Garden State Parkway as a six-lane freeway surrounded by trees, coming to a northbound exit and southbound entrance with CR 509. 

Past this interchange, the road heads into Paterson. Here, the route has a southbound exit and northbound entrance with CR 621 (Valley Road) before becoming an eight-lane freeway and passing to the east of Garret Mountain Reservation. After interchanging with I-80, Route 19 continues north as a five-lane freeway, with three northbound lanes and two southbound lanes, to an interchange with CR 638 (Grand Street). From here, the route becomes a four-lane arterial road and heads into urbanized areas of downtown Paterson. The route turns east and becomes a county-maintained surface road at the intersection with Marshall Street and continues to its northern terminus at the intersection of CR 509 (Main Street) and Ward Street.

==History==

What is now Route 19 was once planned as the Paterson spur of the Garden State Parkway, which was to run through Paterson and Haledon to CR 504 in Wayne. The planned Paterson spur would become an extension of Route 20 in 1959. This road, which was to be a six-lane, $58 million freeway called the Paterson Peripheral, was to run from Clifton north to the existing Route 20 in downtown Paterson. This road was completed between the Garden State Parkway and Valley Road by 1969 and north to I-80 in 1975.
 Upon completion, this road received the Route 20 designation. The extension to Route 20 through Paterson was stopped in 1971 because of the designation of the Great Falls Historic District, a historical district recognizing Paterson’s heritage as an industrial center. By the 1990s, this portion of Route 20 was redesignated Route 19 as it did not connect with the mainline of the route. In 1992, a project to complete the interchange with I-80 and extend the route to Main Street in downtown Paterson to ease congestion was finished. This interchange received the Prize Bridge Award in the category of Grade Separation from the American Institute of Steel Construction in 1996.

<doc id="98367" wikidata="Q179149" url="?curid=98367" title="Antisthenes">
<text>Antisthenes (; , ; 446 366 BCE) was a Greek philosopher and a pupil of Socrates. Antisthenes first learned rhetoric under Gorgias before becoming an ardent disciple of Socrates. He adopted and developed the ethical side of Socrates&#x27; teachings, advocating an ascetic life lived in accordance with virtue. Later writers regarded him as the founder of Cynic philosophy.

==Life==
Antisthenes was born 446 BCE, the son of Antisthenes, an Athenian. His mother was thought to have been a Thracian, though some say a Phrygian, an opinion probably derived from his sarcastic reply to a man who reviled him as not being a genuine Athenian citizen, that the mother of the gods was a Phrygian (referring to Cybele, the Anatolian counterpart of the Greek goddess Rhea). In his youth he fought at Tanagra (426 BCE), and was a disciple first of Gorgias, and then of Socrates; so eager was he to hear the words of Socrates that he used to walk daily from the port of Peiraeus to Athens (about 9 kilometres), and persuaded his friends to accompany him. Eventually he was present at Socrates&#x27; death. He never forgave his master&#x27;s persecutors, and is said to have been instrumental in procuring their punishment. He survived the Battle of Leuctra (371 BCE), as he is reported to have compared the victory of the Thebans to a set of schoolboys beating their master. Although Eudokia Makrembolitissa supposedly tells us that he died at the age of 70, he was apparently still alive in 366 BCE, and he must have been nearer to 80 years old when he died at Athens, 365 BCE. He is said to have lectured at the Cynosarges, a gymnasium for the use of Athenians born of foreign mothers, near the temple of Heracles. Filled with enthusiasm for the Socratic idea of virtue, he founded a school of his own in the Cynosarges, where he attracted the poorer classes by the simplicity of his life and teaching. He wore a cloak and carried a staff and a wallet, and this costume became the uniform of his followers.

Diogenes Laërtius says that his works filled ten volumes, but of these, only fragments remain. His favourite style seems to have been dialogues, some of them being vehement attacks on his contemporaries, as on Alcibiades in the second of his two works entitled &quot;Cyrus&quot;, on Gorgias in his &quot;Archelaus&quot; and on Plato in his &quot;Satho&quot;. His style was pure and elegant, and Theopompus even said that Plato stole from him many of his thoughts. Cicero, after reading some works by Antisthenes, found his works pleasing and called him &quot;a man more intelligent than learned&quot;. He possessed considerable powers of wit and sarcasm, and was fond of playing upon words; saying, for instance, that he would rather fall among crows (&quot;korakes&quot;) than flatterers (&quot;kolakes&quot;), for the one devour the dead, but the other the living. Two declamations have survived, named &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Odysseus&quot;, which are purely rhetorical.

Antisthenes&#x27;s nickname was &quot;The (Absolute) Dog&quot; (, Diog. Laert. 6.13) 

==Philosophy==
===According to Diogenes Laertius===
In his &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot; Diogenes Laertius lists the following as the favourite themes of Antisthenes: &quot;He would prove that virtue can be taught; and that nobility belongs to none other than the virtuous. And he held virtue to be sufficient in itself to ensure happiness, since it needed nothing else except the strength of spirit. And he maintained that virtue is an affair of deeds and does not need a store of words or learning; that the wise man is self-sufficing, for all the goods of others are his; that ill repute is a good thing and much the same as pain; that the wise man will be guided in his public acts not by the established laws but by the law of virtue; that he will also marry in order to have children from union with the handsomest women; furthermore that he will not disdain to love, for only the wise man knows who are worthy to be loved&quot;.

===Ethics===
Antisthenes was a pupil of Socrates, from whom he imbibed the fundamental ethical precept that virtue, not pleasure, is the end of existence. Everything that the wise person does, Antisthenes said, conforms to perfect virtue, and pleasure is not only unnecessary, but a positive evil. He is reported to have held pain and even ill-repute () to be blessings, and he said, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be mad than feel pleasure&quot;. However, it is probable that he did not consider all pleasure worthless, but only that which results from the gratification of sensual or artificial desires, for we find him praising the pleasures which spring &quot;from out of one&#x27;s soul,&quot; and the enjoyments of a wisely chosen friendship. The supreme good he placed in a life lived according to virtue virtue consisting in action, which when obtained is never lost, and exempts the wise person from error. It is closely connected with reason, but to enable it to develop itself in action, and to be sufficient for happiness, it requires the aid of &quot;Socratic strength&quot; ().

===Physics===
His work on natural philosophy (the &quot;Physicus&quot;) contained a theory of the nature of the gods, in which he argued that there were many gods believed in by the people, but only one natural God. He also said that God resembles nothing on earth, and therefore could not be understood from any representation.

===Logic===
In logic, Antisthenes was troubled by the problem of universals. As a proper nominalist, he held that definition and predication are either false or tautological, since we can only say that every individual is what it is, and can give no more than a description of its qualities, e.g. that silver is like tin in colour. Thus, he disbelieved the Platonic system of Ideas. &quot;A horse I can see,&quot; said Antisthenes, &quot;but horsehood I cannot see&quot;. Definition is merely a circuitous method of stating an identity: &quot;a tree is a vegetable growth&quot; is logically no more than &quot;a tree is a tree&quot;.

===Philosophy of language===

Antisthenes apparently distinguished &quot;a general object that can be aligned with the meaning of the utterance&quot; from &quot;a particular object of extensional reference&quot;. This &quot;suggests that he makes a distinction between sense and reference&quot;. The principal basis of this claim is a quotation in Alexander of Aphrodisias&#x27; “Comments on Aristotle&#x27;s &#x27;Topics&#x27;” with a three-way distinction: 
# the semantic medium, 
# an object external to the semantic medium, 
# the direct indication of a thing, }

==Antisthenes and the Cynics==
In later times Antisthenes came to be seen as the founder of the Cynics, but it is by no means certain that he would have recognized the term. Aristotle, writing a generation later refers several times to Antisthenes and his followers &quot;the Antistheneans&quot;, but makes no reference to Cynicism. There are many later tales about the infamous Cynic Diogenes of Sinope dogging Antisthenes&#x27; footsteps and becoming his faithful hound, but it is similarly uncertain that the two men ever met. Some scholars, drawing on the discovery of defaced coins from Sinope dating from the period 350–340 BCE, believe that Diogenes only moved to Athens after the death of Antisthenes, and it has been argued that the stories linking Antisthenes to Diogenes were invented by the Stoics in a later period in order to provide a succession linking Socrates to Zeno via Antisthenes, Diogenes, and Crates. These tales were important to the Stoics for establishing a chain of teaching that ran from Socrates to Zeno. Others argue that the evidence from the coins is weak, and thus Diogenes could have moved to Athens well before 340 BCE. It is also possible that Diogenes visited Athens and Antisthenes before his exile, and returned to Sinope.

Antisthenes certainly adopted a rigorous ascetic lifestyle, and he developed many of the principles of Cynic philosophy which became an inspiration for Diogenes and later Cynics. It was said that he had laid the foundations of the city which they afterwards built.

<doc id="98368" wikidata="Q825624" url="?curid=98368" title="New Jersey Route 120">
<text>Route 120 is a state highway located in East Rutherford, Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. It extends from an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike and Route 3 to another interchange with Route 17, where it continues to the west as County Route 120. Route 120 serves the Meadowlands Sports Complex - which consists of MetLife Stadium, Meadowlands Racetrack, the Meadowlands Arena, and the American Dream shopping and entertainment complex. It heads north from Route 3 as a six-lane freeway through the sports complex to an interchange with the southern terminus of County Route 503. From here, Route 120 heads northwest along the northern edge of the sports complex as a four-lane surface road known as Paterson Plank Road, passing through industrial and commercial areas.

In 1927, Route 3 was legislated along the Paterson Plank Road portion of present-day Route 120. It was eventually designated along the entire portion of current Route 120. In 1953, Route 3 was moved to its current freeway alignment, replacing Route S3, and a portion of Route 20 was designated to run from current Route 3 north to Paterson Plank Road while Paterson Plank Road was removed from the state highway system. The portion of Paterson Plank Road that lost its state highway status in 1953 gained it back in 1972, when it became an extension of Route 20 as a result of the construction of the Meadowlands Sports Complex. As this route was not connected to the mainline of Route 20, it was designated Route 120 by the 1990s. As a result of the construction of American Dream, the interchange between Route 3 and Route 120 was improved. An overpass between eastbound Route 3 and northbound Route 120 was completed in 2009 and a flyover from southbound Route 120 to eastbound Route 3 was completed in 2010.

== Route description ==

Route 120 begins at an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike and Route 3, heading north-northeast on a six-lane freeway through the Meadowlands Sports Complex. Here, MetLife Stadium, home field of the New York Giants and New York Jets of the National Football League, and the Meadowlands station at the terminus of NJ Transit&#x27;s Meadowlands Rail Line is on the west side of the road, while the closed Meadowlands Arena and the American Dream shopping and entertainment complex are on the east side of the road. There is an exit for an access road to the complex. The freeway comes to an end at an interchange where the road continues northeast into Moonachie as County Route 503 (Washington Avenue), while Route 120 exits onto Paterson Plank Road and heads northwest as a four-lane arterial road along the border of Carlstadt to the northeast and East Rutherford to the southwest.
Route 120 passes one of Meadowlands Racetrack&#x27;s grandstands and parallels NJ Transit&#x27;s Meadowlands Rail Line on the East Rutherford side of the road, while commercial and industrial development dominates the Carlstadt side of the road, intersecting with Gotham Parkway. The route has a southbound exit and entrance to the Meadowlands Sports Complex before it crosses Berrys Creek. Upon crossing the creek, Route 120 continues northwest through more commercial and industrial development, intersecting with Murray Hill Parkway towards East Rutherford and 20th Street towards Carlstadt. A short distance past this intersection, the road becomes a four-lane undivided surface road that crosses over NJ Transit’s Pascack Valley Line before coming to an interchange with Route 17. Here, Route 120 terminates and County Route 120 continues to the west as Paterson Avenue.

=== County Route 120 ===
Bergen County Route 120, separate from State Route 120, is an east-west route that begins at its western point along the border between Bergen and Passaic Counties, and heads east. After crossing the Passaic River into Bergen County, the road is called Paterson Avenue in Wallington, and heads east through a residential and low-density commercial area. The road becomes the border between Wallington to the north and East Rutherford to the south. At the end of Wallington, Paterson Avenue is the border between Carlstadt and East Rutherford for a short distance but then the road dips into East Rutherford to avoid a hill (the bypass, which goes over the hill, is called Hoboken Road). The road returns to the Carlstadt/East Rutherford border at Route 17 which it crosses over via an overpass, and then meets up with the northern/western terminus of Route 120 and Paterson Plank Road. While the roadway is named Paterson Avenue and not Paterson Plank Road, CR 120 still a part of Paterson Plank Road and the original plans of the road from Paterson to New York City.

== History ==
In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 3 was legislated to run along the Paterson Plank Road portion of today’s Route 120 as part of its route between Secaucus and Greenwood Lake. By 1947, Route 3 had been designated along the entire alignment of current Route 120. When New Jersey renumbered its state highways in 1953, Route 3 was moved to a new freeway alignment that was Route S3. As a result of this realignment, the portion of the route between modern Route 3 and Paterson Plank Road became a portion of Route 20 while the section along Paterson Plank Road was removed from the state highway system. Paterson Plank Road between County Route 503 and Route 17 joined the state highway system again as an extension of this portion of Route 20 in 1972 when the Meadowlands Sports Complex was slated to be built. At this point, Route 20 had consisted of three disconnected segments. Since none of these segments were connected, this portion of road was redesignated Route 120 by the 1990s.

With the construction of American Dream, several improvements to Route 120 took place. The interchange with Route 3 was reconstructed with an overpass between eastbound Route 3 and northbound Route 120 that was completed in May 2009 at a cost of $38.1 million. Also, a flyover from southbound Route 120 to eastbound Route 3 was completed in early 2010 at a cost of $13 million.

By Joint Resolution No. 6, approved September 9, 1997, the New Jersey Legislature designated Route 120 in East Rutherford, where it runs through the Meadowlands Sports Complex, as the Larry Doby Highway. Former Paterson resident Larry Doby, a professional baseball player with the Newark Eagles of the Negro leagues, later played in the Cleveland Indians and was the first African American to break the color barrier in the American League.

<doc id="98369" wikidata="Q192353" url="?curid=98369" title="Jethro Tull (band)">
<text>Jethro Tull are a British rock band formed in Blackpool, Lancashire in 1967. Initially playing blues rock and jazz fusion, the band soon incorporated elements of English folk music, hard rock and classical music, forging a signature progressive rock sound. The group&#x27;s founder, bandleader, principal composer, lead vocalist, and only constant member is Ian Anderson, a multi-instrumentalist who mainly plays flute and acoustic guitar. The group has featured a succession of musicians throughout the decades, including significant contributors such as guitarists Mick Abrahams and Martin Barre (with Barre being the longest-serving member besides Anderson); bassists Glenn Cornick, Jeffrey Hammond, John Glascock, Dave Pegg, Jonathan Noyce, and David Goodier; drummers Clive Bunker, Barrie &quot;Barriemore&quot; Barlow and Doane Perry; and keyboardists John Evan, Dee Palmer, Peter-John Vettese, Andrew Giddings, and John O&#x27;Hara.

The band achieved moderate recognition in the London club scene and released their debut album, &quot;This Was&quot;, in 1968. After a line-up change which saw original guitarist Mick Abrahams replaced by Martin Barre, the band released a folk-tinged second album, &quot;Stand Up&quot;, in 1969. &quot;Stand Up&quot;, which reached No. 1 in the UK, gave the band their first commercial success. The band soon embarked on a heavy schedule of touring and recording, releasing one studio album every year until 1980. Their musical style shifted in the direction of progressive rock starting with &quot;Aqualung&quot; (1971), which went on to become the band&#x27;s most commercially successful album. Their musical style shifted again to folk rock in the late 1970s. In the early 1980s the band underwent a major line-up change and began to lean into electronic rock. The band won their sole Grammy Award for the 1987 album &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot;, which saw them returning to a hard-rock style. Jethro Tull have sold an estimated 60 million albums worldwide, with 11 gold and 5 platinum albums. They have been described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;one of the most commercially successful and eccentric progressive rock bands&quot;.

The band ceased studio recording activity in the 2000s, but continued to tour until splitting in 2011. Following the band&#x27;s split, Anderson and Barre continued to record and tour as solo artists, with Anderson&#x27;s band billed variously as both &quot;Jethro Tull&quot; and &quot;Ian Anderson&quot; solo. Anderson said in 2014 that Jethro Tull had come &quot;more or less to an end&quot;. Starting in 2017 however, Anderson revived the Jethro Tull name and returned to releasing new studio albums in the 2020s. The current group includes musicians who were part of Jethro Tull during the last years of its initial run, as well as newer musicians associated with Anderson&#x27;s solo band, without Barre&#x27;s involvement.

==History==
===Origins===

Ian Anderson, Jeffrey Hammond, and John Evan (originally Evans), who would later become members of Jethro Tull, attended grammar school together in Blackpool. Anderson was born in Dunfermline, Scotland, in 1947 and grew up in Edinburgh before moving to Blackpool in 1960. At Blackpool Grammar School he gained GCE O-levels in Maths, Physics, Chemistry, English, Art, French, Geography, and Latin, and was a student for two years at Blackpool College of Art. In his teens he wanted to be &quot;an artist, a painter&quot;.

Evans became a fan of the Beatles after seeing them play &quot;Love Me Do&quot; on Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;Scene at 6:30&quot;; although already an accomplished pianist, Evans was inspired by the Beatles to take up drums. Anderson acquired a Spanish guitar and taught himself to play it, and he and Evans decided to form a band. They added Hammond on bass, who came with a collection of blues records.

The group initially played as a three-piece at local clubs and venues before Evans, influenced by Georgie Fame and the Animals, switched to organ. Drummer Barrie Barlow and guitarist Mike Stephens were recruited from local band the Atlantics, guitarist Chris Riley joined and the band developed into a six-piece &quot;blue-eyed soul&quot; group called the John Evan Band (later the John Evan Smash). Evans had shortened his surname to &quot;Evan&quot; at the insistence of Hammond, who thought it sounded better. They recruited Johnny Taylor as a booking agent and played gigs around northwest England, performing a mixture of blues and Motown covers. Hammond left the band to attend art school and was briefly replaced by Derek Ward, then by Glenn Cornick. Riley also quit and was replaced by Neil Smith. The group recorded three songs at Regent Sound Studios in Denmark Street, London, in April 1967, and appeared at the Marquee Club in London in June 1967.

In November 1967 the band moved from the north of England to Luton, Bedfordshire, from central London, and signed a management deal with Terry Ellis and Chris Wright. They replaced Smith with guitarist Mick Abrahams, but quickly realised that supporting a six-piece band was financially impractical and disbanded. Anderson, Abrahams, and Cornick stayed together, recruited Abrahams&#x27;s friend Clive Bunker on drums, and became a British blues band. Cornick recalled that Evan had been told he would be welcome to rejoin. Anderson shared a flat with Cornick in Luton and worked as a cleaner at the Luton Ritz Cinema to pay the rent. According to Cornick, &quot;we were so poor that we would share one can of stew or soup between us each evening&quot;.

===Early years (1967–1968)===

At first, the new band found it difficult to obtain repeat bookings. They changed their name frequently to continue playing the London club circuit, using aliases such as Navy Blue, Ian Henderson&#x27;s Bag o&#x27; Nails, and Candy Coloured Rain. Anderson recalled looking at a poster at a club and realising that the band name he did not recognise was theirs. The names were often supplied by their booking agent&#x27;s staff, one of whom, a history enthusiast, gave them the alias Jethro Tull after the 18th-century agriculturist. The name stuck because they were using it when the manager of the Marquee Club liked their show enough to give them a weekly residency. In an interview in 2006, Anderson said that he had not realised it was the name of &quot;a dead guy who invented the seed drill – I thought our agent had made it up&quot;. He said if he could change one thing in his life, he would go back and change the name of the band to something less historical.

The band recorded a session with producer Derek Lawrence which resulted in the single &quot;Sunshine Day&quot;. The B-side, &quot;Aeroplane&quot;, was an old John Evan Band track with the saxophones removed from the mix. It was released in February 1968 on MGM Records, miscredited to &quot;Jethro Toe&quot;. The more common version of the single, with the name spelled correctly, is actually a counterfeit made in New York. Anderson met Hammond in London, the two renewed their friendship, and Anderson moved into a bedsit in Chelsea with Evan. Hammond became the subject of several songs, beginning with their next single, &quot;A Song for Jeffrey&quot;.

Anderson possessed a large overcoat which his father had given to him with the words &quot;You&#x27;d better take this. It&#x27;s going to be a cold winter.&quot; Along with his flute, this overcoat became part of his early stage image. Anderson had purchased a flute after becoming frustrated with his inability to play guitar as well as Abrahams or Cream guitarist Eric Clapton. Their managers had wanted him to remain a rhythm guitarist, with Abrahams as the front man, and Anderson said later:

I didn&#x27;t want to be just another third-rate guitar player who sounded like a plethora of other third-rate guitar players. I wanted to do something that was a bit more idiosyncratic, hence the switch to another instrument. When Jethro Tull began, I think I&#x27;d been playing the flute for about two weeks. It was a quick learning curve ... literally every night I walked onstage was a flute lesson.

The group got their first major break at the National Jazz and Blues Festival at Sunbury-on-Thames in August 1968, where they drew a rapturous reception and positive reviews in the music press. They said their success at Sunbury was a result of persistent touring, which had generated a grassroots following who came to the festival and encouraged the rest of the audience. Cornick recalled, &quot;From that moment on, we were a big band&quot;.

The group recorded their first album, &quot;This Was&quot;, between June and August 1968. Released in October 1968, it reached number 10 in the UK charts. In addition to original material, the album included the 1961 Doctor Ross blues &quot;Cat&#x27;s Squirrel&quot;, which highlighted Abrahams&#x27;s blues-rock style; and the Rahsaan Roland Kirk-penned jazz piece &quot;Serenade to a Cuckoo&quot;, which gave Anderson a showcase for his growing talents on the flute. Anderson described the group&#x27;s sound around this time as &quot;sort of progressive blues with a bit of jazz&quot;.

Following the album&#x27;s release, Abrahams left the band in December to form his own group, Blodwyn Pig. Several reasons were given for his departure. Abrahams had heard that Ellis wanted Anderson to be the frontman and group leader, at his expense, and he realised that he was unlikely to have the majority share in songwriting. Other reasons given were that Abrahams was a blues purist, while Anderson wanted to branch out into other forms of music; and that Abrahams was unwilling to travel internationally, or play more than three nights a week. Abrahams himself described his reasons more succinctly: &quot;I was fed up with all the nonsense and I wanted to form a band like Blodwyn Pig.&quot;

The group tried several replacements for Abrahams. The first was David O&#x27;List, who had recently left the Nice. After a week&#x27;s rehearsal, O&#x27;List did not show up and lost contact with the group. The next choice was Mick Taylor, who turned the group down because he felt his current gig with John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers was a better deal. Following this, they approached Tony Iommi, guitarist for Earth (soon to be renamed Black Sabbath). Iommi had impressed Jethro Tull when Earth opened for them at a show in Birmingham; he briefly joined the band, but he quit after a few weeks and returned to Birmingham to rejoin Earth, feeling closer to his old band. He stood in with Tull for &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot; on 11 December 1968, when the group performed &quot;A Song for Jeffrey&quot;, although only Anderson&#x27;s singing and flute were live. The rest was mimed to the studio track, which featured Abrahams&#x27; guitar playing.

The next choice was Martin Barre, who had seen the band perform at Sunbury and had auditioned for guitarist at the same time as Iommi. Barre arranged a second audition, and Anderson showed him new songs in a different style from the blues they had been recording. Anderson was impressed by Barre&#x27;s technique and offered him the job. Barre played his first gig with Jethro Tull on 30 December 1968 at the Winter Gardens, Penzance.

===&quot;Stand Up&quot; to &quot;Aqualung&quot; (1969–1971)===
After Barre joined, the group played a few shows supporting Jimi Hendrix in Scandinavia, then began an extensive tour of the US supporting Led Zeppelin and Vanilla Fudge. Jethro Tull attracted a substantial live following, and Ellis and Wright asked Anderson, who had become the principal songwriter, to write a hit single. The result was &quot;Living in the Past&quot;, which reached No. 3 in May 1969 on the UK singles chart and No. 11 in the US and resulted in an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.
The next album was &quot;Stand Up&quot;, recorded during April–May and August 1969. It was released in September 1969 and quickly reached No. 1 in the UK, the only album by the group to do so. Anderson had now established himself as leader and songwriter and wrote all the material for the album, except for his jazzy rearrangement of J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;Bourrée in E minor BWV 996 (fifth movement)&quot;. The cover of the album unfolded to show a photo insert of the band attached like a pop-up book.

Immediately after releasing &quot;Stand Up&quot;, the group set off on their first headlining tour of the US, which included an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival. Barre recalled, &quot;It was really the turning point for Jethro Tull—for everything that we were to become and everything we were to inspire in others.&quot; The band was invited to play at the Woodstock Festival but Anderson declined, not wanting to be associated with the hippie movement and risk being permanently moulded into one type of sound.

On 29 January 1970, Jethro Tull appeared again on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, performing &quot;Witch&#x27;s Promise&quot;. Evan rejoined the band in early 1970; he had stayed in London, sharing a flat with Anderson, after the John Evan Band broke up, and was studying music at the University of London. He was initially reluctant to rejoin the band because of his studies, which gave him access to a free studio, but he had played as a session musician on Tull&#x27;s next album, &quot;Benefit&quot; (1970), and when Anderson needed someone to play the keyboard parts on tour, his tutor persuaded him that rejoining would be a good idea. The album reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 11 in the US and the group sold out 20,000-seat arenas, establishing themselves as a premier live act. In August they played to one of their largest audiences at the 1970 Isle of Wight festival.

The Isle of Wight appearance was followed by another US tour, in the course of which Jethro Tull became only the second rock band after The Beatles to perform at Carnegie Hall in New York City. Cornick left the band at the end of the tour: he had wanted to socialise on tour, while the other band members were more reclusive. Cornick said later that he was fired by Anderson, while the band&#x27;s official website said he was &quot;invited to leave&quot; and was given encouragement and support to form his own band. Cornick subsequently formed Wild Turkey, a band which he revived for Jethro Tull fan conventions decades later. He died in August 2014.

Anderson invited Jeffrey Hammond to replace Cornick, buying him a new bass for the purpose. Hammond had not played an instrument since leaving the John Evan Band, and he was chosen more for his compatibility with the other band members than for his musical skills. This line-up recorded &quot;Aqualung&quot; in late 1970 (released in 1971). The album was split into two parts, subtitled &quot;Aqualung&quot; and &quot;My God&quot;, and featured among other things Anderson&#x27;s views on organised religion. Recording the album was problematic because of technical difficulties in the studio, and also because of Hammond&#x27;s rusty musical skills. On &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot;, Anderson recorded the backing track by himself, singing to a hi-hat accompaniment, and the rest of the band added their parts later. Despite Anderson&#x27;s concern that it may have been &quot;too radical&quot; compared with the band&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;Aqualung&quot; was the first Jethro Tull album to reach the top ten in the US, peaking at No. 7. It sold over one million copies, earning it a gold disc by the RIAA in July 1971.

===Progressive rock (1971–1976)===

Drummer Clive Bunker quit the group in May 1971, citing heavy touring schedules and his wish to spend more time with his family. Bunker was replaced by Barrie Barlow, whom Anderson renamed &quot;Barriemore&quot;. Barlow&#x27;s first recording with the band was for the five-track EP &quot;Life Is a Long Song&quot;. Except for Barre, the line-up of Jethro Tull now consisted entirely of former members of the John Evan Band from Blackpool. In July 1971, Jethro Tull relocated to Switzerland to avoid increasingly strict UK tax laws and became tax exiles. The move put strain on Anderson&#x27;s marriage to his first wife, which lasted for another year before they divorced.

Anderson became annoyed with music critics who described &quot;Aqualung&quot; as a concept album, which he had not intended it to be. &quot;I always said at the time, this is not a concept album. It&#x27;s an album of varied songs ... in which three or four are kind of the keynote pieces for the album, but [that] doesn&#x27;t make it a concept album.&quot; He decided to &quot;come up with something that really is the mother of all concept albums&quot; in response. Influenced by the style of Monty Python, he wrote a suite that combined complex musical ideas with offbeat humour and made fun of the band, its audience and its critics. This album, released in 1972 as &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;, consisted of a single continuous piece of music running for 43 minutes, spread over two sides of vinyl, an uncommon format for rock albums. It was written and recorded in stages, the whole band helping with arrangements, and was co-credited to a fictional schoolboy, Gerald Bostock. &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; became the first Tull album to reach number one on the (US) &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart. The following year&#x27;s &quot;A Passion Play&quot; was the only other album by the band to do so.

&quot;Living in the Past&quot; was also released in 1972; it is a double-album compilation of remixed singles, B-sides and outtakes, including the entirety of the &quot;Life Is a Long Song&quot; EP, which closed the album. The third side was recorded live at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall on 4 November 1970. The album was a success and allowed new fans to catch up with the band&#x27;s early singles, particularly in the US where they had not been popular on initial release. &quot;New Musical Express&quot; called Jethro Tull one of &quot;Britain&#x27;s most important and successful 2nd generation progressive bands&quot;.

In the summer of 1972, the band attempted to record a double album at Château d&#x27;Hérouville studios in France, which the Rolling Stones and Elton John, among others, were also using at the time, but they were not happy with the studio and abandoned the project, subsequently referring to it as the &quot;Chateau d&#x27;Isaster&quot;. They returned to England where in early 1973 they recorded and released &quot;A Passion Play&quot;, another single-track concept album, with allegorical lyrics focusing on the afterlife and, like &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;, containing unusual instrumentation. The album also featured an eccentric interlude, &quot;The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles&quot;, co-written by Anderson, Evan and bassist Hammond and narrated by Hammond. &quot;A Passion Play&quot; sold well but received poor reviews, including a particularly damning review of a live performance from Chris Welch of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. After the negative reaction to the album, Anderson angrily shut himself away from all communication with the press.

While the band&#x27;s popularity with critics began to wane, their popularity with the record-buying public remained strong, as was seen by the high sales figures of their follow-up album, 1974&#x27;s &quot;War Child&quot;. Originally intended for the soundtrack of a film, &quot;War Child&quot; reached number two on the US Billboard charts, was given critical acclaim and produced two singles, &quot;Bungle in the Jungle&quot; (#12 on the US singles chart) and &quot;Skating Away on the Thin Ice of the New Day&quot;. It also included a short acoustic song with satirical lyrics, &quot;Only Solitaire&quot;, which was believed to have been aimed at &quot;L.A. Times&quot; rock music critic Robert Hilburn, who had written a harsh review of &quot;A Passion Play&quot; concerts at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. Anderson said later that the song was written before Hilburn&#x27;s review and was aimed at music critics in general. The &quot;War Child&quot; tour included a female string quartet playing on the new material.

In 1975 the band released &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot;, an album in the style of 1971&#x27;s &quot;Aqualung&quot;, which contrasted softer, acoustic guitar-based pieces with lengthier, more bombastic works reinforced by Barre&#x27;s electric guitar. Written and recorded during Anderson&#x27;s divorce from his first wife Jennie Franks, the album was characterised by a more introspective tone and received mixed reviews. By this point in their career, Jethro Tull had been awarded five RIAA gold records for sales of &quot;Stand Up&quot; (1969), &quot;Aqualung&quot; (1971), &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; (1972), &quot;Living in the Past&quot; (1972), &quot;A Passion Play&quot; (1973), and would earn a sixth for &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot; (1975). For the 1975 tour, Dee Palmer, who had long been the band&#x27;s orchestral arranger, joined the band on stage on keyboards and synthesisers. In February 1975, Jethro Tull sold out five nights at the 20,000-seat Los Angeles Forum, prompting &quot;Melody Maker&quot; to run the headline &quot;Jethro – Now The World&#x27;s Biggest Band?&quot; Bassist Hammond left the band after the tour and was replaced by John Glascock from flamenco-rock band Carmen, who had supported Tull on several dates on the &quot;War Child&quot; tour.

&quot;Too Old to Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll: Too Young to Die!&quot; was released in 1976. It is a concept album about the life of an ageing rocker. (On the &quot;Bursting Out&quot; live version of &quot;Too Old to Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, released two years later, Anderson denies that the song is about himself.) Glascock made his first appearance as bassist with Tull on this album, and also contributed harmony and second vocals. Palmer continued as arranger, and appeared as a guest keyboard player on two songs. A television special was recorded showing the development of the album&#x27;s concept in a live show, with the band dressed in tongue-in-cheek outfits, but was never officially released.
On the 1976 tour, Jethro Tull became one of the first bands to use giant projection screens in the larger stadium shows. &quot;Too Old...&quot; did not sell as well as the other 1970s albums, but the 1976 compilation &quot;M.U. - The Best of Jethro Tull&quot;, achieved Platinum Album in US and Gold record in UK.

===Folk rock (1977–1979)===

In the late 1970s, Jethro Tull released three folk rock albums, &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; (1977), &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; (1978), and &quot;Stormwatch&quot; (1979). &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; (1977) was the first Tull album to receive generally positive reviews since the release of &quot;Living in the Past&quot; (1972). The Christmas/Winter Solstice-themed song &quot;Ring Out, Solstice Bells&quot; was released as an EP in the winter of 1976, prior to the release of &quot;Songs From the Wood&quot;, and was a moderate hit on the British charts. It later became a popular Christmas song in the UK and was re-recorded in 2003 for &quot;The Jethro Tull Christmas Album&quot;.

The band had long ties to folk rockers Steeleye Span - Tull performed as backing band on Steeleye Span vocalist Maddy Prior&#x27;s 1978 solo album, &quot;Woman in the Wings&quot;, to repay her for the vocals she had contributed on their &quot;Too Old to Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll: Too Young to Die!&quot; album - and also to Fairport Convention. Fairport members Dave Pegg, Martin Allcock, Dave Mattacks and Ric Sanders have all played with Tull at various times, as well as folk drummer Gerry Conway, who became a Fairport member after playing with Tull. Although Jethro Tull were not formally considered to be part of the folk-rock movement, which had begun nearly a decade earlier with Fairport Convention, there was clearly an exchange of musical ideas among Tull and the folk rockers. By this time Anderson had moved to a farm in the countryside, and his newly bucolic lifestyle was reflected in his songwriting and in the title track of &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; (1978).

The band continued to tour and in 1978 released a live double album, &quot;Bursting Out&quot;, which had been recorded during the European leg of the 1978 &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; tour. During the US leg of this tour in 1979, John Glascock suffered health problems and was replaced by Anderson&#x27;s friend and former Stealers Wheel bassist, Tony Williams.

Tull&#x27;s third folk-influenced album, &quot;Stormwatch&quot;, was released in 1979. During the making of the album, Glascock suffered major health problems related to open-heart surgery from the previous year and Anderson played bass on much of the album. After the release of &quot;Stormwatch&quot;, Fairport Convention bassist Dave Pegg was hired for the ensuing tour, during which Glascock died from heart complications at his home in England.

===The &quot;Big Split&quot; and electronic rock (1980–1984)===

Following the &quot;Stormwatch&quot; tour in early 1980, Barlow, Evan, and Palmer left the band. Barlow was said to have been depressed after Glascock&#x27;s death, and Evan and Palmer were having to reconsider their future after Anderson had announced that he wanted to record a solo album. 
In the 2008 Classic Artists documentary &quot;Jethro Tull: Their Fully Authorised Story&quot;, Barlow said he had left the band by mutual agreement with Anderson. Evan and Palmer both recalled being dismissed by letter. 
After their departure from Jethro Tull, Evan and Palmer briefly collaborated in a classical-based pop/rock band called Tallis. Jethro Tull was left with Anderson (the only original member), Martin Barre, and Dave Pegg.

The first album of the 1980s was intended to be Anderson&#x27;s first solo album, but after pressure from Chrysalis Records he agreed to release it as a Jethro Tull album. Anderson retained Barre on electric guitar and Pegg on bass and added Mark Craney on drums, plus special guest keyboardist/violinist Eddie Jobson (ex–Roxy Music, Frank Zappa, Curved Air, and UK, the last of which had opened several shows on Tull&#x27;s &quot;Stormwatch&quot; tour). The album featured prominent use of synthesisers and its style contrasted sharply with the established Tull sound. It was given the title &quot;A&quot;, taken from the labels on the master tapes of the scrapped solo album, which were marked &quot;A&quot; for &quot;Anderson&quot;. &quot;A&quot; was released in mid-1980.

In keeping with the mood of innovation surrounding the album, Jethro Tull developed a music video titled &quot;Slipstream&quot;. Four staged and separately filmed music videos were mixed with concert footage from the &quot;A&quot; tour. London&#x27;s Hammersmith Odeon was used for exterior scenes, but the main concert footage came from an American performance at the Los Angeles Sports Arena (as heard on the Magic Piper ROIO), filmed in November 1980. The video, released in 1981, was directed by David Mallet, who had directed the pioneering &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; video for David Bowie.

Jobson and Craney left following the &quot;A&quot; tour and the band had a succession of temporary drummers. Gerry Conway left after deciding he could not be the one to replace Barlow; Phil Collins played with the band at the first Prince&#x27;s Trust concert in 1982; and Paul Burgess played for the US leg of the &quot;Broadsword and the Beast&quot; tour. Doane Perry started drumming for the band in 1984.

The band did not release an album in 1981; this was the first year that the band have not release anything. However, recording sessions took place with Anderson, Barre, Pegg, and Conway in which Anderson played keyboards. Some of the tracks recorded were later released on the &quot;Nightcap&quot; compilation in 1993. In 1982 Peter-John Vettese joined on keyboards and the band returned to a folkier sound, still with synthesisers, for 1982&#x27;s &quot;The Broadsword and the Beast&quot;. The ensuing concert tour was well attended and the shows featured one of the group&#x27;s last indulgences in theatricality, in which the stage was built to resemble a Viking longship and the band performed in medieval costume. An Anderson solo album (actually an Anderson-Vettese collaboration) appeared in 1983 in the form of the heavily electronic &quot;Walk into Light&quot;. As with later solo work by Anderson and Barre, some of the &quot;Walk into Light&quot; songs, such as &quot;Fly by Night&quot;, &quot;Made in England&quot;, and &quot;Different Germany&quot;, later made their way into Jethro Tull live sets.

In 1984, Jethro Tull released &quot;Under Wraps&quot;, another electronic album which, like &quot;Walk into Light&quot;, used a drum machine instead of a live drummer. Although the band had reportedly liked the sound (Barre even considered the album one of his personal favourites), it was not well received. The video for &quot;Lap of Luxury&quot; was given moderate rotation on the newly influential MTV music video channel. Vettese quit the band after the tour, angry at critics for bad reviews of &quot;The Broadsword and the Beast&quot; (1982), &quot;Walk into Light&quot; (1983) and &quot;Under Wraps&quot; (1984), and the band took a three-year break because of vocal cord problems Anderson had developed while touring the demanding &quot;Under Wraps&quot; material. During this hiatus, Anderson continued to oversee the salmon farm on the Isle of Skye he had founded in 1978. The single &quot;Coronach&quot; was released in the UK in 1986 after it was used as the theme tune for a Channel 4 television programme called &quot;Blood of the British&quot;.

===Anderson, Barre, Pegg, and Perry: the &quot;hard rock&quot; Tull (1987–1994)===
Jethro Tull returned in 1987 with &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot;. With Vettese absent, Anderson contributed synth programming, and the album featured early Tull 1970&#x27;s-style electric guitar from Martin Barre. Three of the tracks on the album used a drum machine, with Doane Perry and Gerry Conway sharing drum duties on the others. The album was a critical and commercial success. Keyboard player Don Airey (ex-Rainbow, Ozzy Osbourne, Michael Schenker Group, Gary Moore, Colosseum II) joined the band for the &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot; tour.

In 1989, Jethro Tull won the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental, beating the favourite Metallica and their &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; album. The award was controversial, as many did not consider Tull to be a hard rock band, much less heavy metal. On the advice of their manager, who told them they had no chance of winning, no-one from the band attended the award ceremony. In response to the criticism Tull received after the award, their label, Chrysalis, took out an advertisement in a British music periodical with a picture of a flute lying on a pile of iron and the line, &quot;the flute is a heavy metal instrument&quot;. Anderson joked in an interview, &quot;We do sometimes play our mandolins very loudly.&quot; In 2007, the win was named one of the ten biggest upsets in Grammy history by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, and ranked #1 in EW&#x27;s 2017 listing of Grammy upsets. In 1992, when Metallica did win the Grammy in the hard rock/metal category, their drummer Lars Ulrich joked, &quot;First thing we&#x27;re going to do is thank Jethro Tull for not putting out an album this year&quot;. (A play on a Grammy comment made by Paul Simon some years before, who thanked Stevie Wonder for the same thing.)

The style of &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot; (1987) has been compared to that of Dire Straits. Anderson no longer had his previous vocal range and used lower registers, and Barre&#x27;s guitar sound drifted towards Mark Knopfler&#x27;s. Two songs in particular—&quot;Farm on the Freeway&quot; and &quot;Steel Monkey&quot;— were given heavy radio airplay. The album contained the popular live song &quot;Budapest&quot;, the longest song on the album at just over ten minutes, which depicted a backstage scene with a local female stagehand. &quot;Mountain Men&quot;, with lyrics which described a scene from World War II in Africa, was more popular in Europe. The band promoted &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot; with &quot;The Not Quite the World, More the Here and There Tour&quot; on which Anderson played occasional rhythm guitar, the first time in Jethro Tull&#x27;s history that two electric guitarists had played together on stage.

In 1988, &quot;20 Years of Jethro Tull&quot; was released, a five-LP themed set which was also released as a three-CD set, and as a truncated single CD version on &quot;20 Years of Jethro Tull: Highlights&quot;. The set consisted largely of rarities and outtakes from throughout the band&#x27;s history, including a variety of live and remastered tracks, with a booklet outlining the band&#x27;s history. Many of the outtakes were later included as bonus tracks on remastered releases of the band&#x27;s studio albums. In 1989 the band released &quot;Rock Island&quot;, which was less successful than &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot;. The opening track, &quot;Kissing Willie&quot;, featured bawdy, double-entendre lyrics and over-the-top heavy metal riffing that seemed to make fun of the group&#x27;s Grammy award win. The accompanying video was not given much airplay because of its sexual imagery. A couple of favourites emerged from the album: &quot;Big Riff and Mando&quot;, a wry account of the theft of Barre&#x27;s prized mandolin by a starstruck fan; and the upbeat &quot;Another Christmas Song&quot;, which was re-recorded for the 2003 &quot;The Jethro Tull Christmas Album&quot; release. 1991&#x27;s &quot;Catfish Rising&quot; returned to generous use of mandolin and acoustic guitar, and made less use of keyboards than any Tull album of the 1980s. Notable tracks included &quot;Rocks on the Road&quot;, which featured acoustic guitar and lyrics about urban life; and &quot;Still Loving You Tonight&quot;, a bluesy, low-key ballad.

===&quot;Roots to Branches&quot; and &quot;J-Tull.com&quot;: the world music influences (1995–2000)===
The band toured a semi-acoustic show in 1992 with Dave Mattacks on drums. The tour was recorded and became Tull&#x27;s second official live album, &quot;A Little Light Music&quot;. At this point in his musical career, Anderson had to re-learn how to play the flute after his daughter, who was taking flute lessons at school, discovered that he used incorrect fingering. The first Tull releases that contained revised flute playing were in the 1993 &quot;25th Anniversary Box Set&quot; which included, with remixes of classic Tull songs and unreleased live material, a CD of songs from the band&#x27;s entire back catalogue, re-recorded by the then current line-up. The box set also included the 1993 &quot;Nightcap&quot; compilation album which contained unreleased studio material, mainly from the scrapped pre-&quot;A Passion Play&quot; album, with many of the flute parts re-recorded.

Dave Pegg, Tull&#x27;s bass player for fifteen years, made the decision to leave the band during the recording of 1995&#x27;s &quot;Roots to Branches&quot; album to concentrate on his work with Fairport Convention. Anderson had begun writing songs that featured world music influences, and Pegg was unhappy with the musical direction the band was taking. He contributed to only three of the songs on the album, and played his last concerts with Tull in the UK in September 1995. Doane Perry, returning as the band&#x27;s full-time drummer, recruited his friend and respected session bass player Steve Bailey to replace Pegg. Anderson relinquished control of the rhythm section arrangements, leaving them completely to Bailey and Perry, but despite his studio contributions Bailey did not join the band, and Pegg&#x27;s eventual replacement as Tull bassist was Jonathan Noyce, who took over in October 1995. 
&quot;Roots to Branches&quot; (1995) and 1999&#x27;s &quot;J-Tull Dot Com&quot; were less rock-based than &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot; (1987) or &quot;Catfish Rising&quot; (1991). The songs on these albums reflected the musical influences of decades of performing around the world. In songs such as &quot;Out of the Noise&quot; and &quot;Hot Mango Flush&quot;, for example, Anderson depicted third-world street scenes. These two albums reflected Anderson&#x27;s feelings about being an old rocker, with songs such as the pensive &quot;Another Harry&#x27;s Bar&quot;, &quot;Wicked Windows&quot; (a meditation on reading glasses), and the gruff &quot;Wounded, Old and Treacherous&quot;.

===Live albums, world tours, and &quot;The Jethro Tull Christmas Album&quot; (2001–2010)===

The original 1967 line-up of Jethro Tull (Anderson, Abrahams, Cornick, and Bunker) reunited in January 2002 for a one-off performance in an English pub. The gig was filmed for the &quot;Living with the Past&quot; DVD. This was the only time that the four original members of the band had played together since 1968, and the only time that a previous Tull line-up had been reunited.

&quot;The Jethro Tull Christmas Album&quot;, a collection of traditional Christmas songs and Christmas songs written by Jethro Tull, was released in 2003. It was the last studio album to be recorded by the band for nearly 20 years, and it became their biggest commercial success since 1987&#x27;s &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot;. An Ian Anderson live double album and DVD were released in 2005, titled &quot;Ian Anderson Plays the Orchestral Jethro Tull&quot;. A DVD and album titled &quot;Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970&quot; were released in 2005.

The entire 1971 &quot;Aqualung&quot; album was performed live for a small audience at the end of a US tour, on 23 November 2004, by Anderson, Barre, Perry, Giddings, and Noyce. The performance was recorded for broadcast on radio station XM Radio as part of the station&#x27;s musical milestones &quot;most important albums ever recorded; timeless albums re-recorded by the original artists&quot; project, and was later released as an album, &quot;Aqualung Live&quot;. Proceeds from sales of the album were donated to homeless charities, as the &#x27;Aqualung&#x27; of the song was a homeless tramp).

A boxed set DVD &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; containing two DVDs, &quot;Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970&quot; and &quot;Living with the Past&quot;, was released in 2006. Bassist Jon Noyce left the band in March 2006, and keyboard player Andrew Giddings quit in July 2006 citing constant touring and not enough time for family. They were replaced by David Goodier and John O&#x27;Hara. &quot;The Best of Acoustic Jethro Tull&quot;, released in 2007, was a 24-song collection of Tull&#x27;s and Anderson&#x27;s acoustic performances, taken from various albums, which included a new live acoustic version of &quot;One Brown Mouse&quot; and a live performance of a traditional song (attributed to Henry VIII), &quot;Pastime with Good Company&quot; .

In 2007, the band also released a DVD/CD of a live concert, &quot;Live at Montreux 2003&quot;, which featured the longest unchanged line-up of Anderson, Barre, Perry, Noyce and Giddings. Songs performed included &quot;Fat Man&quot;, &quot;With You There to Help Me&quot; and &quot;Hunting Girl&quot;. In 2010, the band were commemorated with a Heritage Award by PRS for Music, and a plaque was placed on the church in Blackpool where the founders of the band had played their first gig in 1964.

===Anderson and Barre split &amp; disbanding (2011–2017)===
Martin Barre stated in November 2011 that there were no current plans for further Jethro Tull work; in 2012, he put his own band together and toured as Martin Barre&#x27;s New Day. The new band included former Tull bassist Jonathan Noyce and played mostly Tull material. In 2015, Barre said: &quot;It&#x27;s important that people realize there will never be a Jethro Tull again. There will be two solo bands, the Ian Anderson Band and the Martin Barre Band, and long may they exist, and long may they enjoy playing music.&quot; Barre said he hated to hear &quot;Oh, you&#x27;ve left Jethro Tull&quot;. He said, &quot;Ian wanted to finish Jethro Tull. [He] wanted to stop the band completely.&quot;

On 30 January 2012, Anderson announced on the Jethro Tull website that &quot;Thick as a Brick 2: Whatever Happened to Gerald Bostock?&quot;, recorded by Anderson and the &quot;Ian Anderson Touring Band&quot; as a follow-up to 1972&#x27;s &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;, would be released on 2 April 2012. The band&#x27;s line-up on the album and on the ensuing tour included two former Jethro Tull members, bassist David Goodier and keyboard player John O&#x27;Hara, plus guitarist Florian Opahle, drummer Scott Hammond and additional vocalist Ryan O&#x27;Donnell. &quot;Thick as a Brick 2&quot; had its world premiere on 14 April 2012 at Perth Concert Hall in Scotland, at the start of an 18-month tour to promote the new album and the original album.

In November 2013, Anderson announced that another new album, &quot;Homo Erraticus&quot;, (&quot;The Wandering Man&quot;) would be released in April 2014. Tours of the UK and US followed the release, and the album was performed in its entirety. &quot;Homo Erraticus&quot; was a prog-rock concept album which, according to Anderson, &quot;chronicles the weird imaginings of one Ernest T. Parritt, as recaptured by the now middle-aged Gerald Bostock after a trip to Mathew Bunter&#x27;s Old Library Bookshop in Linwell village. Bostock and Bunter came across this dusty, unpublished manuscript, written by local amateur historian Ernest T. Parritt, (1873–1928), and entitled Homo Britanicus Erraticus.&quot; Like &quot;Thick as a Brick 2&quot;, &quot;Homo Erraticus&quot; was described as an Ian Anderson solo album.

In April 2014, after the release of &quot;Homo Erraticus&quot;, Anderson stated that in future he would release all his music under his own name. He said Jethro Tull had &quot;more or less come to an end&quot; during the past 10 years, and that in his twilight years he would prefer to use his own name, &quot;for the most part being composer of virtually all Tull songs and music since 1968&quot;. Anderson also said in the album&#x27;s liner notes that he would continue to perform under his own name.

In 2015 Anderson toured the project &quot;Jethro Tull – The Rock Opera&quot; with the &quot;Ian Anderson Touring Band&quot;, performing lyrically modified Tull material and new rock songs about Jethro Tull the agriculturist, with elaborate video productions on stage. The touring band included for the first time a female vocalist, Icelander Unnur Birna Björnsdóttir, who also played the violin. The 2016 Tour visited Europe, Australia, and the US. In 2017, Anderson toured under the name &quot;Jethro Tull by Ian Anderson&quot;.

=== Re-formation, 50th anniversary tour, &quot;The Zealot Gene&quot;, &quot;RökFlöte&quot;, and &quot;Curious Ruminant&quot; (2017–present) ===

In September 2017, Anderson announced plans for a tour to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Tull&#x27;s first album, &quot;This Was&quot;; and for a new studio album in 2018, for which the band line-up comprised Anderson, Hammond, Opahle, O&#x27;Hara, and Goodier, all members of Anderson&#x27;s solo band since 2012. Martin Barre was absent from the line-up. On 2 January 2018, Anderson published on jethrotull.com a picture with the caption &quot;IA in the studio working on a new album for release March 2019. Shhhh; keep it a secret...&quot;

On 1 June 2018, Parlophone Records released a 50-track collection featuring all 21 Tull albums, named &quot;50 for 50&quot;, to celebrate the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The notes for the &quot;50 for 50&quot; booklet stated that a new album scheduled for 2019 would be a solo record by Ian Anderson, and not a new album by Jethro Tull.

In November 2019, &quot;Ian Anderson and the Jethro Tull band&quot; announced The Prog Years Tour, with eleven dates across the UK scheduled for September and October 2020. The tour was subsequently postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Guitar duties were to have been handled by new member Joe Parrish, Opahle having left the band at the end of 2019 to focus on production work and family. In March 2021, Anderson announced a new Jethro Tull studio album, &quot;The Zealot Gene&quot;, the first album under the Jethro Tull name since &quot;The Jethro Tull Christmas Album&quot; (2003), the first with all original material since &quot;J-Tull Dot Com&quot; (1999), and the first without Barre&#x27;s involvement since &quot;This Was&quot; (1968).

In April 2021, on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of 1971&#x27;s &quot;Aqualung&quot;, the official music video for the song, an animation directed by Iranian animator/director Sam Chegini, was premiered on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Anderson said Chegini had created &quot;a unique rendition of the &#x27;Aqualung&#x27; song with abstract and documentary-type footage.&quot; On 13 July 2021 it was announced that Jethro Tull had signed with Inside Out Music for the release of &quot;The Zealot Gene&quot; in 2022. On 17 November 2022, the band announced that they had finished recording their 23rd studio album, which was expected to be released in spring 2023. In January 2023 the title of the album was revealed to be &quot;RökFlöte&quot;, with a release date of 21 April 2023.

The band&#x27;s twenty-fourth album, &quot;Curious Ruminant&quot;, will be released on 7 March 2025. It was announced with the release of the lead single and title track on 10 January 2025.

==Legacy==
Other musicians who have been influenced by Jethro Tull include Iron Maiden&#x27;s Steve Harris and Bruce Dickinson, W.A.S.P.&#x27;s Blackie Lawless, Pearl Jam&#x27;s Eddie Vedder, Dream Theater&#x27;s John Myung, Blind Guardian&#x27;s Marcus Siepen, Joe Bonamassa, the Decemberists&#x27; Jenny Conlee, and folk doom metal band Blood Ceremony. &lt;br&gt;

Rush&#x27;s Geddy Lee said: &quot;I was a massive Tull fan from very young ... and I hope that [is reflected] in Rush. I was mesmerised by Ian Anderson. His presentation was simply magical and he delivered it with such a sense of humour and great style ... We [of Rush] saw it as a huge challenge to try and create something that can seem so dynamic onstage.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

Gentle Giant&#x27;s Derek Shulman considers Jethro Tull to be one of the greatest bands in the history of progressive rock. After touring with the band in 1972, he praised them as musicians and as friends. &lt;br&gt;

Nick Cave is a fan of Jethro Tull. Cave named one of his sons Jethro in honour of the group. His own group, Grinderman, performed &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot; during soundchecks. At Cave&#x27;s request, Ian Anderson presented him with his Album of the Year trophy at the MOJO Awards in 2008.

Despite their longevity, commercial success and influence within progressive rock, Jethro Tull have never been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Ian Anderson has expressed disinterest in the band being inducted, saying, &quot;I think it&#x27;s quite wrong for us to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when so many great American acts are being ignored and will be for all time because I suppose they haven&#x27;t sold enough records or aren&#x27;t that popular to impress the founding fathers of the Rock Hall. [...] Tull isn&#x27;t an example of Americana, and Americana is what the Rock Hall should be about.&quot;

<doc id="98370" wikidata="Q130206" url="?curid=98370" title="London Bridge">
<text>The name &quot;London Bridge&quot; refers to several historic crossings that have spanned the River Thames between the City of London and Southwark in central London since Roman times. The current crossing, which opened to traffic in 1973, is a box girder bridge built from concrete and steel. It replaced a 19th-century stone-arched bridge, which in turn superseded a 600-year-old stone-built medieval structure. In addition to the roadway, for much of its history, the broad medieval bridge supported an extensive built up area of homes and businesses, part of the City&#x27;s Bridge ward, and its southern end in Southwark was guarded by a large stone City gateway. The medieval bridge was preceded by a succession of timber bridges, the first of which was built by the Roman founders of London (Londinium) around AD 50.

The current bridge stands at the western end of the Pool of London and is positioned upstream from previous alignments. The approaches to the medieval bridge were marked by the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr on the northern bank and by Southwark Cathedral on the southern shore. Until Putney Bridge opened in 1729, London Bridge was the only road crossing of the Thames downstream of Kingston upon Thames. London Bridge has been depicted in its several forms, in art, literature, and songs, including the nursery rhyme &quot;London Bridge Is Falling Down&quot;, and the epic poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot; by T. S. Eliot.

The modern bridge is owned and maintained by Bridge House Estates, an independent charity of medieval origin overseen by the City of London Corporation. It carries the A3 road, which is maintained by the Greater London Authority. The crossing also delineates an area along the southern bank of the River Thames, between London Bridge and Tower Bridge, that has been designated as a business improvement district.

==History==
===Location===
The abutments of modern London Bridge rest several metres above natural embankments of gravel, sand and clay. From the late Neolithic era the southern embankment formed a natural causeway above the surrounding swamp and marsh of the river&#x27;s estuary; the northern ascended to higher ground at the present site of Cornhill. Between the embankments, the River Thames could have been crossed by ford when the tide was low, or ferry when it was high. Both embankments, particularly the northern, would have offered stable beachheads for boat traffic up and downstream – the Thames and its estuary were a major inland and Continental trade route from at least the 9th century BC.

There is archaeological evidence for scattered Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age settlement nearby, but until a bridge was built there, London did not exist. A few miles upstream, beyond the river&#x27;s upper tidal reach, two ancient fords were in use. These were apparently aligned with the course of Watling Street, which led into the heartlands of the Catuvellauni, Britain&#x27;s most powerful tribe at the time of Caesar&#x27;s invasion of 54 BC. Some time before Claudius&#x27;s conquest of AD 43, power shifted to the Trinovantes, who held the region northeast of the Thames Estuary from a capital at Camulodunum, nowadays Colchester in Essex. Claudius imposed a major &quot;colonia&quot; at Camulodunum, and made it the capital city of the new Roman province of Britannia. The first London Bridge was built by the Romans as part of their road-building programme, to help consolidate their conquest.

===Roman bridges ===
It is possible that Roman military engineers built a pontoon type bridge at the site during the conquest period (AD43). A bridge of any kind would have given a rapid overland shortcut to Camulodunum from the southern and Kentish ports, along the Roman roads of Stane Street and Watling Street (now the A2). The Roman roads leading to and from London were probably built around AD50, and the river-crossing was possibly served by a permanent timber bridge. On the relatively high, dry ground at the northern end of the bridge, a small, opportunistic trading and shipping settlement took root and grew into the town of Londinium. 

A smaller settlement developed at the southern end of the bridge, in the area now known as Southwark. The bridge may have been destroyed along with the town in the Boudican revolt (AD 60), but Londinium was rebuilt and eventually, became the administrative and mercantile capital of Roman Britain. The bridge offered uninterrupted, mass movement of foot, horse, and wheeled traffic across the Thames, linking four major arterial road systems north of the Thames with four to the south. Just downstream of the bridge were substantial quays and depots, convenient to seagoing trade between Britain and the rest of the Roman Empire.

===Early medieval bridges ===
With the end of Roman rule in Britain in the early 5th century, Londinium was gradually abandoned and the bridge fell into disrepair. In the Anglo-Saxon period, the river became a boundary between the emergent, mutually hostile kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex. By the late 9th century, Danish invasions prompted at least a partial reoccupation of the site by the Saxons. The bridge may have been rebuilt by Alfred the Great soon after the Battle of Edington as part of Alfred&#x27;s redevelopment of the area in his system of burhs, or it may have been rebuilt around 990 under the Saxon king Æthelred the Unready to hasten his troop movements against Sweyn Forkbeard, father of Cnut the Great. A skaldic tradition describes the bridge&#x27;s destruction in 1014 by Æthelred&#x27;s ally Olaf, to divide the Danish forces who held both the walled City of London and Southwark. The earliest contemporary written reference to a Saxon bridge is , when chroniclers mention how Cnut&#x27;s ships bypassed the crossing during his war to regain the throne from Edmund Ironside.

Following the Norman conquest in 1066, King William I rebuilt the bridge. It was repaired or replaced by King William II, destroyed by fire in 1136, and rebuilt in the reign of Stephen. Henry II created a monastic guild, the &quot;Brethren of the Bridge&quot;, to oversee all work on London Bridge. In 1163, Peter of Colechurch, chaplain and warden of the bridge and its brethren, supervised the bridge&#x27;s last rebuilding in timber.

=== Old London Bridge (1209–1831)===
After the murder of his former friend and later opponent Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, the penitent King Henry II commissioned a new stone bridge in place of the old, with a chapel at its centre dedicated to Becket as martyr. The archbishop had been a native Londoner, born at Cheapside, and a popular figure. The Chapel of St Thomas on the Bridge became the official start of pilgrimage to his Canterbury shrine; it was grander than some town parish churches, and had an additional river-level entrance for fishermen and ferrymen. Building work began in 1176, supervised by Peter of Colechurch. The costs would have been enormous; Henry&#x27;s attempt to meet them with taxes on wool and sheepskins probably gave rise to a later legend that London Bridge was built on wool packs. 

In 1202, before Colechurch&#x27;s death, Isembert, a French monk who was renowned as a bridge builder, was appointed by King John to complete the project. Construction was not finished until 1209. There were houses on the bridge from the start; this was a normal way of paying for the maintenance of a bridge, though in this case it had to be supplemented by other rents and by tolls. From 1282 two bridge wardens were responsible for maintaining the bridge, heading the organization known as the Bridge House. The only two collapses occurred when maintenance had been neglected, in 1281 (five arches) and 1437 (two arches). In 1212, perhaps the greatest of the early fires of London broke out, spreading as far as the chapel and trapping many people.

The bridge was about long, and had nineteen piers, supported by timber piles. The piers were linked above by nineteen arches and a wooden drawbridge. Above and below the water-level, the piers were enclosed and protected by &#x27;starlings&#x27;, supported by deeper piles than the piers themselves. The bridge, including the part occupied by houses, was from wide. The roadway was mostly around wide, varying from about 14 feet to 16 feet, except that it was narrower at defensive features (the stone gate, the drawbridge and the drawbridge tower) and wider south of the stone gate. The houses occupied only a few feet on each side of the bridge. They received their main support either from the piers, which extended well beyond the bridge itself from west to east, or from &#x27;hammer beams&#x27; laid from pier to pier parallel to the bridge. It was the length of the piers which made it possible to build quite large houses, up to deep.

The numerous starlings restricted the river&#x27;s tidal ebb and flow. The difference in water levels on the two sides of the bridge could be as much as , producing ferocious rapids between the piers resembling a weir. Only the brave or foolhardy attempted to &quot;shoot the bridge&quot; – steer a boat between the starlings when in flood – and some were drowned in the attempt. The bridge was &quot;for wise men to pass over, and for fools to pass under.&quot; The restricted flow also meant that in hard winters the river upstream was more susceptible to freezing.

The number of houses on the bridge reached its maximum in the late fourteenth century, when there were 140. Subsequently, many of the houses, originally only 10 to 11 feet wide, were merged, so that by 1605 there were 91. Originally they are likely to have had only two storeys, but they were gradually enlarged. In the seventeenth century, when there are detailed descriptions of them, almost all had four or five storeys (counting the garrets as a storey); three houses had six storeys. Two-thirds of the houses were rebuilt from 1477 to 1548. In the seventeenth century, the usual plan was a shop on the ground floor, a hall and often a chamber on the first floor, a kitchen and usually a chamber and a waterhouse (for hauling up water in buckets) on the second floor, and chambers and garrets above. Approximately every other house shared in a &#x27;cross building&#x27; above the roadway, linking the houses either side and extending from the first floor upwards.

All the houses were shops, and the bridge was one of the City of London&#x27;s four or five main shopping streets. There seems to have been a deliberate attempt to attract the more prestigious trades. In the late fourteenth century more than four-fifths of the shopkeepers were haberdashers, glovers, cutlers, bowyers and fletchers or from related trades. By 1600 all of these had dwindled except the haberdashers, and the spaces were filled by additional haberdashers, by traders selling textiles and by grocers. From the late seventeenth century there was a greater variety of trades, including metalworkers such as pinmakers and needle makers, sellers of durable goods such as trunks and brushes, booksellers and stationers.

The three major buildings on the bridge were the chapel, the drawbridge tower and the stone gate, all of which seem to have been present soon after the bridge&#x27;s construction. The chapel was last rebuilt in 1387–1396, by Henry Yevele, master mason to the king. Following the Reformation, it was converted into a house in 1553. The drawbridge tower was where the severed heads of traitors were exhibited. The drawbridge ceased to be opened in the 1470s and in 1577–1579 the tower was replaced by Nonsuch House—a pair of magnificent houses. Its architect was Lewis Stockett, Surveyor of the Queen&#x27;s Works, who gave it the second classical facade in London (after Somerset House in the Strand). The stone gate was last rebuilt in the 1470s, and later took over the function of displaying the heads of traitors. The heads were dipped in tar and boiled to preserve them against the elements, and were impaled on pikes. The head of William Wallace was the first recorded as appearing, in 1305, starting a long tradition. Other famous heads on pikes included those of Jack Cade in 1450, Thomas More in 1535, Bishop John Fisher in the same year, and Thomas Cromwell in 1540. In 1598, a German visitor to London, Paul Hentzner, counted over 30 heads on the bridge:

The last head was installed in 1661; subsequently heads were placed on Temple Bar instead, until the practice ceased.

There were two multi-seated public latrines, but they seem to have been at the two ends of the bridge, possibly on the riverbank. The one at the north end had two entrances in 1306. In 1481, one of the latrines fell into the Thames and five men were drowned. Neither of the latrines is recorded after 1591.

In 1578–1582 a Dutchman, Peter Morris, created a waterworks at the north end of the bridge. Water wheels under the two northernmost arches drove pumps that raised water to the top of a tower, from which wooden pipes conveyed it into the city. In 1591 water wheels were installed at the south end of the bridge to grind corn.

In 1633 fire destroyed the houses on the northern part of the bridge. The gap was only partly filled by new houses, with the result that there was a firebreak that prevented the Great Fire of London (1666) spreading to the rest of the bridge and to Southwark. The Great Fire destroyed the bridge&#x27;s waterwheels, preventing them from pumping water to fight the fire. For nearly 20 years, only sheds replaced the burnt buildings. They were replaced In the 1680s, when almost all the houses on the bridge were rebuilt. The roadway was widened to by setting the houses further back, and was increased in height from one storey to two. The new houses extended further back over the river, which would cause trouble later. 

In 1695, the bridge had 551 inhabitants. From 1670, attempts were made to keep traffic in each direction to one side, at first through a keep-right policy and from 1722, through a keep-left policy. This has been suggested as one possible origin for the practice of traffic in Britain driving on the left.

A fire in September 1725 destroyed all the houses south of the stone gate; they were rebuilt. The last houses to be built on the bridge were designed by George Dance the Elder in 1745, but these buildings had begun to subside within a decade. The (29 Geo. 2. c. 40) gave the City Corporation the power to purchase all the properties on the bridge so that they could be demolished and the bridge improved. While this work was underway, a temporary wooden bridge was constructed to the west of London Bridge. It opened in October 1757 but caught fire and collapsed in the following April. The old bridge was reopened until a new wooden construction could be completed a year later. To help improve navigation under the bridge, its two centre arches were replaced by a single wider span, the Great Arch, in 1759.

Demolition of the houses was completed in 1761 and the last tenant departed after some 550 years of housing on the bridge. Under the supervision of Dance the Elder, the roadway was widened to and a balustrade was added &quot;in the Gothic taste&quot; together with 14 stone alcoves for pedestrians to shelter in. However, the creation of the Great Arch had weakened the rest of the structure and constant expensive repairs were required in the following decades; this, combined with congestion both on and under bridge, often leading to fatal accidents, resulted in public pressure for a modern replacement.
===New London Bridge (1831–1967) ===

In 1799, a competition was opened to design a replacement for the medieval bridge. Entrants included Thomas Telford; he proposed a single iron arch span of , with centre clearance beneath it for masted river traffic. His design was accepted as safe and practicable, following expert testimony. Preliminary surveys and works were begun, but Telford&#x27;s design required exceptionally wide approaches and the extensive use of multiple, steeply inclined planes, which would have required the purchase and demolition of valuable adjacent properties.

A more conventional design of five stone arches, by John Rennie, was chosen instead. It was built west (upstream) of the original site by Jolliffe and Banks of Merstham, Surrey, under the supervision of Rennie&#x27;s son. Work began in 1824 and the foundation stone was laid, in the southern coffer dam, on 15 June 1825.
The old bridge continued in use while the new bridge was being built, and was demolished after the latter opened in 1831. New approach roads had to be built, which cost three times as much as the bridge itself. The total costs, around £2.5 million (£ in ), were shared by the British Government and the Corporation of London.

Rennie&#x27;s bridge was long and wide, constructed from Haytor granite. The official opening took place on 1 August 1831; King William IV and Queen Adelaide attended a banquet in a pavilion erected on the bridge. The northern approach road, King William Street, was renamed after the monarch and statue of the king subsequently installed.

In 1896 the bridge was the busiest point in London, and one of its most congested; 8,000 pedestrians and 900 vehicles crossed every hour. To designs by engineer Edward Cruttwell, it was widened by , using granite corbels. Subsequent surveys showed that the bridge was sinking an inch (about 2.5 cm) every eight years, and by 1924 the east side had sunk some three to four inches (about 9 cm) lower than the west side. The bridge would have to be removed and replaced.

====Sale to Robert McCulloch====

Common Council of the City of London member Ivan Luckin put forward the idea of selling the bridge, and recalled: &quot;They all thought I was completely crazy when I suggested we should sell London Bridge when it needed replacing.&quot; Subsequently, in 1968, Council placed the bridge on the market and began to look for potential buyers. On 18 April 1968, Rennie&#x27;s bridge was purchased by the Missourian entrepreneur Robert P. McCulloch of McCulloch Oil for US$2,460,000. The claim that McCulloch believed mistakenly that he was buying the more impressive Tower Bridge was denied by Luckin in a newspaper interview. Before the bridge was taken apart, each granite facing block was marked for later reassembly. The blocks were taken to Merrivale Quarry at Princetown in Devon, where were sliced off the inner faces of many, to facilitate their fixing. (Stones left behind were sold in an online auction when the quarry was abandoned and flooded in 2003.) 10,000 tons of granite blocks were shipped via the Panama Canal to California, then trucked from Long Beach to Arizona. They were used to face a new, purpose-built hollow core steel-reinforced concrete structure, ensuring the bridge would support the weight of modern traffic. The bridge was reconstructed by Sundt Construction at Lake Havasu City, Arizona, and was re-dedicated on 10 October 1971 in a ceremony attended by London&#x27;s Lord Mayor and celebrities. The bridge carries the McCulloch Boulevard and spans the Bridgewater Channel, an artificial, navigable waterway that leads from the Uptown area of Lake Havasu City.

===Modern London Bridge (1973–present) ===
The current London Bridge was designed by architect Lord Holford and engineers Mott, Hay and Anderson. It was constructed by contractors John Mowlem and Co from 1967 to 1972, and opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 16 March 1973. It comprises three spans of prestressed-concrete box girders, a total of long. The cost of £4 million (£ in ), was met entirely by the Bridge House Estates charity. The current bridge was built in the same location as Rennie&#x27;s bridge, with the previous bridge remaining in use while the first two girders were constructed upstream and downstream. Traffic was then transferred onto the two new girders, and the previous bridge demolished to allow the final two central girders to be added.

In 1984, the British warship HMS &quot;Jupiter&quot; collided with London Bridge, causing significant damage to both the ship and the bridge.

On Remembrance Day 2004, several bridges in London were furnished with red lighting as part of a night-time flight along the river by wartime aircraft. London Bridge was the one bridge not subsequently stripped of the illuminations, which are regularly switched on at night.

The current London Bridge is often shown in films, news and documentaries showing the throng of commuters journeying to work into the City from London Bridge Station (south to north). An example of this is actor Hugh Grant crossing the bridge north to south during the morning rush hour, in the 2002 film &quot;About a Boy&quot;.

On 11 July 2008, as part of the annual Lord Mayor&#x27;s charity appeal and to mark the 800th anniversary of Old London Bridge&#x27;s completion in the reign of King John, the Lord Mayor and Freemen of the City drove a flock of sheep across the bridge, supposedly by ancient right.

On 3 June 2017, three pedestrians were killed by a van in a terrorist attack. Altogether, eight people died and 48 were injured in the attack. Security barriers were installed on the bridge to help isolate the pedestrian pavement from the road.

==Transport==
The nearest London Underground stations are Monument, at the northern end of the bridge, and London Bridge at the southern end. London Bridge station is also served by National Rail.

==In literature and popular culture==
* The nursery rhyme and folk song &quot;London Bridge Is Falling Down&quot; has been speculatively connected to several of the bridge&#x27;s historic collapses.
* Rennie&#x27;s New London Bridge is a prominent landmark in T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, wherein he compares the shuffling commuters across London Bridge to the hell-bound souls of &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot;. Also in that poem is a reference to the &quot;inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold&quot; of the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr, designed by Sir Christopher Wren, which marks the northern approach to the bridge, and the poem also ends with the lines &quot;I sat upon the shore/fishing, with the arid plain behind me./Shall I at least set my lands in order?/London bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down&quot;.
* In Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot;, in the story entitled &quot;Scotland-yard&quot; there is much discussion by coal-heavers on the replacement of London Bridge in 1832, including a portent that the event will dry up the Thames.
* Gary P. Nunn&#x27;s song &quot;London Homesick Blues&quot; includes the lyrics, &quot;Even London Bridge has fallen down, and moved to Arizona, now I know why.&quot;
* English composer Eric Coates wrote a march about London Bridge in 1934.
* London Bridge is named in the World War II song &quot;The King is Still in London&quot; by Roma Campbell-Hunter &amp; Hugh Charles.
* Fergie released a song titled &quot;London Bridge&quot; in 2006 as the lead single of her first solo album, &quot;The Dutchess.&quot; The music video for the track features the singer on a boat near London&#x27;s Tower Bridge, which, despite the song&#x27;s title, is not London Bridge. The song peaked at number one on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100 chart.

<text>John Adair (born 27 October 1963), better known as Johnny Adair or Mad Dog Adair, is a Northern Irish loyalist and the former leader of the &quot;C Company&quot;, 2nd Battalion Shankill Road, West Belfast Brigade of the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF). This was a cover name used by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), a loyalist paramilitary organisation. In 2002 Adair was expelled from the organisation following a violent internal power struggle. Since 2003, he, his family and a number of supporters have been forced to leave Northern Ireland by the mainstream UDA.

==Early life==
Adair was born into an Ulster Protestant loyalist family and raised in Belfast. He grew up on the Old Lodge Road, a now mostly demolished road linking the lower Shankill Road to the lower Oldpark area, a site of many sectarian clashes and riots during the Troubles. The son of Jimmy and Mabel Adair, he was the youngest of their seven children, his siblings being (in age order) Margaret, Mabel, Jean, Etta, Lizzie and Archie (who was later also a UDA member).

Adair&#x27;s father, Jimmy, had no involvement in loyalist activities and maintained close friendships with a number of nationalists in the New Lodge area, where he was a member of the local homing pigeon society. Jimmy continued his membership even after his son had emerged as a leading loyalist paramilitary. According to Ian S. Wood, Adair had little parental supervision and did not attend school regularly. However Hugh Jordan and David Lister insist that the Adairs were attentive and fairly strict parents who sent their children to Sunday school. As a child, Adair attended Hemsworth Primary School close to his Old Lodge Road home, where he was noted as an unremarkable student.

As he grew older Adair took to the streets, forming a skinhead street gang with a group of young loyalist friends, who &quot;got involved initially in petty then increasingly violent crime&quot;. Members included Donald Hodgen, Sam &quot;Skelly&quot; McCrory, &quot;Fat&quot; Jackie Thompson, James and Herbie Millar. Adair, Hodgen, McCrory and Thompson were classmates at the Somerdale School on the Crumlin Road. Although the gang still officially attended school, they would frequently play truant, take a bus into the countryside and consume large quantities of cider.

The gang regularly congregated outside the Buffs Club on the corner of the Crumlin Road and Century Street, where their numbers were swollen by other young men from in and around the Shankill. Eventually, Adair started a Rock Against Communism-styled band called Offensive Weapon which openly espoused support for the National Front.

At 17, Adair began a relationship with Gina Crossan, three years his junior and also a skinhead, who at the time had shaved her head to leave only a tuft of hair at the front. The notoriety of the gang, which was part of a wider group in loyalist north and west Belfast known as the &quot;NF Skinz&quot; because of their support for the ideas of the National Front, gained widespread notoriety on 14 January 1981 when &quot;Sieg Heiling&quot; members launched a brutal attack on anti-racist fans of The Specials and The Beat when the two bands played a concert at the Ulster Hall. Adair would later be assaulted by Irish republicans while attending a UB40 concert.

This was followed in August 1983 by the so-called &quot;Gluesniffers March&quot;, when 200 skinheads descended on Belfast City Hall determined to riot with Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament members who were holding a rally, with the march taking its name from the prevalence of solvent abuse among the skinheads. The gang was not sanctioned by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), and led to South Belfast Brigadier John McMichael declaring that he wanted its members &quot;run out of town&quot;. As a result, while still in his teens, Adair was threatened with knee-capping by the UDA after assaulting an old age pensioner but was given the option of joining the UDA&#x27;s young wing, the Ulster Young Militants, instead. He joined the Ulster Young Militants, and later the UDA – a legal loyalist paramilitary organisation which used the cover name &quot;Ulster Freedom Fighters&quot; (UFF) when it carried out killings.

==Paramilitary activity==
Upon joining the UDA in 1984, Adair and his friends were assigned to C8, an active unit that formed part of the West Belfast Brigade&#x27;s C Company, which covered the lower Shankill. The young members&#x27; early duties mostly consisted of rioting, along with occasional gun attacks on heavily armoured police vehicles or arson attacks on local businesses felt to be employing &quot;too many&quot; Catholics. The unit was eager to become even more active and from an early stage plotted to kill a nationalist solicitor, Pat Finucane, although the plan was initially vetoed by the brigade leadership.

By the early 1990s, a new leadership had emerged on the Shankill Road following the killing of powerful South Belfast Brigadier and UDA Deputy Commander John McMichael in 1987 by a booby-trap car bomb planted by the Provisional IRA; less than three months later, Supreme Commander Andy Tyrie resigned after an attempt was made on his life. He was not replaced; instead the organisation was run by its Inner Council. With the West Belfast UDA brigadier and spokesman Tommy Lyttle in prison and gradually eased out of the leadership, Adair, as the most ambitious of the &quot;Young Turks&quot;, established himself as head of the UDA&#x27;s &quot;C Company&quot;, 2nd Battalion based on the Shankill. Adair formed a so-called &quot;Dream Team&quot; of active gunmen, with many of his friends from his former skinhead gang including Sam &quot;Skelly&quot; McCrory, Mo Courtney, &quot;Fat&quot; Jackie Thompson, and Donald Hodgen recruited into the unit. In the early 1990s,Gary ‘Smickers’ Smith, who also ran a pet shop on the Shankill Road, was eventually promoted to second in command of C Company and became deputy to Adair.
===Brigadier===
Adair succeeded Jim Spence as brigadier in 1993 after Spence was imprisoned for extortion. When Adair became the first person in Northern Ireland charged with directing terrorism in 1995, he admitted that he had been a UDA leader for three years up to 1994. During this time, Adair and his colleagues were involved in multiple random murders of Catholic civilians, mostly carried out by a special killing unit led by Stevie &quot;Top Gun&quot; McKeag. At Adair&#x27;s trial in 1995, the prosecuting lawyer said he was dedicated to his cause against those whom he &quot;regarded as militant republicans – among whom he had lumped almost the entire Roman Catholic population&quot;.

Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) detectives believe his unit killed up to 40 people in this period. Adair once remarked to a Catholic journalist from the Republic of Ireland that normally Catholics traveled in the boot of his car. According to a press report in 2003, Adair was handed details of republican suspects by the Intelligence Corps, and was even invited for dinner with them in the early 1990s.

In his autobiography, he alleged he was frequently passed information on republican paramilitaries by sympathetic British Army members, and that his own whereabouts were passed to the IRA by the RUC Special Branch, who, he claimed, hated him. As brigadier of the West Belfast UDA, Adair was entitled to one of the six seats on the organisation&#x27;s Inner Council and in this role, because he wanted to continue on the path of violence, clashed frequently with South East Antrim Brigadier Joe English, who advocated seeking a peace settlement.

The BBC described Adair as &quot;the most controversial, high-profile and ubiquitous&quot; of all the paramilitaries operating in Northern Ireland during this period. The IRA&#x27;s Shankill Road Bombing of a fish shop in October 1993 was an attempt to assassinate Adair and the rest of the UDA&#x27;s Belfast leadership in reprisal for attacks on Catholics. The office above the shop was the UDA&#x27;s Shankill headquarters and a meeting was due to take place shortly after the bomb exploded. The bomb detonated prematurely, killing one of the two IRA men, Thomas Begley, and nine Protestants (a UDA volunteer and eight civilians). The UDA retaliated by carrying out the Greysteel massacre in County Londonderry, an attack on the Rising Sun bar in which eight civilians, two of whom were Protestants, were shot dead. While Adair was targeted for assassination a number of times, he frequently exaggerated the number of attempts.

===First conviction===
During this time, undercover officers from the RUC had recorded months of discussions with Adair in which he boasted of his activities, producing enough evidence to charge him with directing terrorism. He was convicted on 6 September 1995 and sentenced to 16 years in the Maze prison. As is standard practice in the UDA, Adair vacated his position as Brigadier upon entering prison, with his friend Winkie Dodds succeeding him.

Adair was held with other loyalist prisoners in their &quot;block&quot; of the prison. In prison, according to some reports, Adair sold drugs such as cannabis, ecstasy tablets and amphetamines to other loyalist prisoners, earning him an income of £5,000 a week.

In January 1998, Adair was one of five loyalist prisoners visited in the prison by British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo Mowlam. She persuaded them to drop their objection to their political representatives continuing the talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement in April that year. Following the killing of Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) leader Billy Wright inside the Maze prison by the INLA the previous December, the UDA prisoners had voted two to one to withdraw from the peace process. Adair&#x27;s co-operation was essential as he was regarded as the key figure in securing the support of the other loyalist prisoners.

At the end of April 1999, while he was on home leave from prison, Adair was shot at and grazed by a bullet in the head at a UB40 concert in Belfast which he had attended with his wife. He blamed the shooting on republicans, although a drug dealer was responsible. In September 1999, Adair was released as part of the early-release scheme for paramilitary prisoners under the Belfast Agreement.

==Loyalist feuds==
===2000===

After his release, much of Adair&#x27;s activities was bound up with violent internecine feuds within the UDA and between the UDA and other loyalist paramilitary groups. The motivation for such violence is sometimes difficult to piece together; it usually involves a combination of political differences over the ceasefires, rivalry over control of territory, and competition over the proceeds of organised crime.

In August 2000 Adair claimed he had been attacked with a pipe bomb by the IRA. That same month, on 19 August, he organised a &quot;loyalist day of culture&quot; on the lower Shankill Road. He invited the five other brigadiers from the Inner Council to attend, along with loyalist Michael Stone and politicians John White and Frank McCoubrey.

This event featured loyalist marching bands and a militant show of strength by the West Belfast Brigade. It also marked the start of a violent feud between the UDA and its main rival, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Clashes first broke outside the Diamond Jubilee on the Lower Shankill, then spread to the Rex Bar, a popular UVF drinking den where shots were fired and UVF members beaten up. Adair and his followers then attacked the homes of UVF members and their families in the Lower Shankill, forcing them out of the area, while orders were also sent to A Company in Highfield that the estate should be &quot;cleansed&quot; of UVF members.

Adair&#x27;s men also sacked the homes of Gusty Spence and Winston Churchill Rea as part of a move to drive the UVF off the Shankill. The UVF struck back on 21 August, killing two of Adair&#x27;s allies, Jackie Coulter and Bobby Mahood, on the Crumlin Road. In response, C Company members burned down the headquarters of the UVF-linked Progressive Unionist Party (PUP). Adair was arrested on 22 August 2000 whilst he and Dodds were driving down the Shankill Road. As a result of his involvement in the violence, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Mandelson revoked Adair&#x27;s early release and returned him to prison. This time he was sent to Maghaberry instead of the Maze. With command reverting to Dodds, UVF member Samuel Rockett was killed by C Company the following night. The UVF struck back and 4 more people on both sides were killed before the feud then petered out.

===2002===
On 15 May 2002, Adair was released from prison again. Outside the prison he was greeted by up to 300 of his supporters. Once free, he was a key part of an effort to forge stronger ties between the UDA and the LVF, a small breakaway faction of the UVF founded in 1996 by Billy Wright and following his killing, commanded by Mark &quot;Swinger&quot; Fulton, with whom Adair was on good terms. Fulton had been in Maghaberry since December 2001. The most open declaration of this alliance was a joint mural depicting Adair&#x27;s UDA &quot;C company&quot; and the LVF. Other elements in the UDA strongly resisted these movements, which they saw as an attempt by Adair to win external support in a bid to take over the leadership of the UDA. Some UDA members disliked his overt association with the drugs trade, which the LVF were even more heavily involved with. For his part Adair controlled a block of flats in his Lower Shankill stronghold from which he and his allies dealt drugs.

Adair also sought to work closely with Belfast-based dissidents such as Frankie Curry and Jackie Mahood, provoking further anger from the UVF. Another loyalist feud erupted, and ended with several men dead and scores evicted from their homes. The Rathcoole home of long-standing UDA member Sammy Duddy was raked by gunfire; although Duddy was not injured in the shooting attack, his pet chihuahua Bambi was fatally wounded by shots fired through the front door by masked gunmen from Adair&#x27;s C Company. Adair later admitted in an interview he gave for journalist Suzanne Breen that Duddy never got over the loss of Bambi.

On 13 September 2002, Jim Gray – the head of the UDA in East Belfast and an archrival of Adair – was shot in the face by Adair&#x27;s supporters. The shooting was described by the police as &quot;loosely related&quot; to the death of Stephen Warnock, an LVF leader, as part of a loyalist feud.

Adair had been spreading rumours that Gray and John Gregg, head of the UDA South East Antrim Brigade, were both to be stood down as part of his attempts to take full control of the UDA. As part of this campaign Adair had visited Warnock&#x27;s family and told them that Gray had been involved in their relative&#x27;s death, even though he was aware that it had actually been carried out by a hired Red Hand Commando (RHC) gunman after Warnock refused to pay a drug debt to a North Down businessman. As a result, Gray was shot by a lone gunman after he left the Warnock home, where he had been paying his respects to the deceased.

====Expulsion from the UDA====
On 20 September 2002, Adair was summoned to an Inner Council meeting held in Sandy Row where there was a showdown between him and the other brigadiers, including Gray. Fearing an ambush, Adair had his allies &quot;Fat&quot; Jackie Thompson and James &quot;Sham&quot; Millar smuggle a pistol for him to the meeting. Five days later, Adair was expelled from the UDA for treason along with close associate John White. Adair&#x27;s response to the expulsion was &quot;Fuck them uns&quot; and declared the West Belfast Brigade a separate organisation from the mainstream UDA. He even erected &quot;West Belfast UDA – Business as Usual&quot; banners on the Shankill Road. By this point Adair had even lost the support of the Shoukri brothers, his proteges in north Belfast who had been amongst his closest allies outside of his own area but who decided to side with the mainstream UDA in this dispute. There were attempts on Adair&#x27;s and White&#x27;s lives.

Adair returned to prison in January 2003, when his early release licence was revoked by Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Paul Murphy on grounds of engaging in unlawful activity. He appointed &quot;Fat&quot; Jackie Thompson as his replacement as Brigadier. On 1 February 2003, UDA divisional leader John Gregg was shot dead along with another UDA member, Robert &quot;Rab&quot; Carson, on returning from a Rangers FC match in Glasgow. The killing was widely blamed on Adair&#x27;s C Company – Gregg was one of those who had organised the expulsion of Adair from the UDA. Among the mainstream UDA, a powerful faction of Adair opponents quickly formed under the leadership of South Belfast brigadier Jackie McDonald. In the early hours of 6 February (five days after Gregg&#x27;s shooting and just hours before his funeral was due to take place), about twenty Adair supporters, including White and Adair&#x27;s wife, fled their homes for Scotland after 100 heavily armed men from the mainstream UDA invaded Adair&#x27;s stronghold, forcing them to quit Northern Ireland.

==Exile from Northern Ireland and personal life==
Following the ousting of C Company from the Shankill Road, Adair&#x27;s family and supporters went to Bolton where they garnered the nickname &#x27;Bolton Wanderers&#x27; after the football club of the same name. Following the killing of LVF leader Billy Wright in 1997 Adair became the new contact man for a group of Bolton-based members of the neo-Nazi organisation Combat 18 (C18) who up to that point had been close to the LVF. Adair built up a close relationship with these far right activists, even wearing an England shirt during UEFA Euro 2000 that one of the members had given him. Furthermore, when the feud with the UVF was launched in 2000 through C Company members attacking the UVF&#x27;s Rex Bar stronghold a few C18 members fought alongside the UDA men. As a result, it was to the homes of these far rightists, in particular a Bolton-based tattoo artist and C18 member, that Adair&#x27;s supporters fled in 2003.

Adair was released from prison on 10 January 2005 and immediately headed to Bolton after being taken by helicopter to nearby Manchester. The police in Bolton questioned his wife, Gina about her involvement in the drugs trade, and his son, Jonathan Jr (nicknamed both &#x27;Mad Pup&#x27; and &#x27;Daft Dog&#x27;) has been charged with selling crack cocaine and heroin. Adair himself was arrested and fined for assault and threatening behaviour in September 2005. He had married Gina Crossan, his partner for many years, at the Maze prison on 21 February 1997. Together they had three children.

Several claims have been made about Adair&#x27;s sexuality by his former girlfriend, Jackie &quot;Legs&quot; Robinson, and UDA hitman Michael Stone. Stone claimed in his autobiography that Adair had sex with other male inmates while in prison. Jackie Robinson, who beginning in 1991 sustained a nine-year off-and-on relationship with Adair, backed up this claim in an interview with &quot;The Mirror&quot;, in which she alleged that Adair has been having sex with long-term friend and fellow loyalist Skelly McCrory since they were teenagers.

Robinson told &quot;The Mirror&quot; journalist that she and Adair had sexual encounters during her visits to him in prison and that he received visits from prostitutes as well. In her book, &quot;In Love With a Mad Dog&quot;, Robinson stated that after a UDA killing had been carried out, he would become highly aroused and afterwards be &quot;particularly wild in bed&quot;. It was also alleged that the mere discussion of the details of operations he had helped plan gave him a &quot;sexually charged excitement&quot;, even when the killings had been done by others.

After his release, he was almost immediately re-arrested for violently assaulting his wife Gina, who had been diagnosed with and treated for ovarian cancer. After this episode Adair reportedly moved to Scotland but later relocated to Horwich, near Bolton in early 2003. In 2003 he became a grandfather for the first time.

In May 2006, it was reported that Adair had received £100,000 from John Blake Publishing for a ghost-written autobiography. In November 2006, the UK&#x27;s Five television channel transmitted an observational documentary on Adair made by Donal MacIntyre. The focus of the film centred around Adair and another supposedly reformed character, a former neo-Nazi from Germany known as Nick Greger, and their trip to Uganda to build an orphanage. Adair was seen firing rifles, stating it was the first time he had done so without wearing gloves. In November 2008, Adair appeared in an episode of &quot;Danny Dyer&#x27;s Deadliest Men&quot; which profiled fellow C Company inmate Sam &quot;Skelly&quot; McCrory.

On 20 July 2015 three Irish republicans (Antoin Duffy, Martin Hughes and Paul Sands) were found guilty of planning to murder Adair and Sam McCrory. Charges against one of the accused in the trial were dropped on 1 July.

On 10 September 2016, Johnny and Gina Adair&#x27;s son, Jonathan Jr, was found dead in Troon, aged 32. Adair Jr died from an accidental overdose while celebrating the day after his release from prison for motoring offences. Adair Jr had been in and out of prison since the family fled Northern Ireland. He served a five-year sentence for dealing heroin and crack cocaine. The year before Jonathan had been cleared of a gun raid at a party and in 2012 was the target of a failed bomb plot. He was also facing trial later that year on drugs charges.

In December 2023, while recording a podcast with far-right activist Tommy Robinson, Adair surprisingly expresed a grudging respect for the IRA hunger strikers, describing the manner of their deaths as &quot;dedication at the highest level&quot; for a political cause and admitting that he would not have volunteered to do the same if asked.

<doc id="98372" wikidata="Q845626" url="?curid=98372" title="Mafdet">
<text>Mafdet (also Mefdet, Maftet) was a goddess in the ancient Egyptian religion. She was often depicted wearing a skin of a cheetah, and protected against the bite of snakes and scorpions. She was part of the pantheon of ancient Egyptian deities that was prominent during the First Dynasty of Egypt. She was prominent during the reign of pharaoh Den whose image appears on stone vessel fragments from his tomb and is mentioned in a dedicatory entry in the Palermo Stone. Mafdet was the deification of legal justice, or possibly of capital punishment. She was associated with the protection of the king&#x27;s chambers and other sacred places, and with protection against venomous animals, which were seen as transgressors against Maat. In the Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, she was mentioned as protecting the sun god Ra from venomous snakes.

== Roles in Egypt ==
Mafdet defended Ra from threats during his daily voyage. She would hunt by night (earning the epithet &quot;Piercer of Darkness&quot;) and ensure the coming of dawn.

When Osiris was separated into pieces, Mafdet protected him while she helped bind the pieces together.

Depictions in royal tombs associate the symbol of Mafdet with the symbol of Anubis, suggesting that Mafdet accompanied the gods as a hunter or executioner while Anubis fulfilled his role as messenger and attendant.

== Art ==
In art, Mafdet was alternately shown as a feline or mongoose, a woman with such a head, or such an animal with the head of a woman. The type of feline varies but is commonly interpreted as a cheetah or serval.

She also was depicted in her animal form running up the side of an executioner&#x27;s staff of office. It was said that Mafdet ripped out the hearts of wrong-doers, delivering them to the pharaoh&#x27;s feet like cats that present humans with rodents or birds they have killed or maimed.

During the New Kingdom, Mafdet was seen as ruling over the judgment hall in Duat where the enemies of the pharaoh were decapitated with &quot;Mafdet&#x27;s claw&quot;.

<doc id="98377" wikidata="Q297402" url="?curid=98377" title="Prodicus">
<text>Prodicus of Ceos (; , &quot;Pródikos ho Keios&quot;; c. 465 BC – c. 395 BC) was a Greek philosopher, and part of the first generation of Sophists. He came to Athens as ambassador from Ceos, and became known as a speaker and a teacher. Plato treats him with greater respect than the other sophists, and in several of the Platonic dialogues Socrates appears as the friend of Prodicus. One writer claims Socrates used his method of instruction. Prodicus made linguistics and ethics prominent in his curriculum. The content of one of his speeches is still known, and concerns a fable in which Heracles has to make a choice between Virtue and Vice. He also interpreted religion through the framework of naturalism.

==Life==
Prodicus was a native of Ioulis on the island of Ceos, the birthplace of Simonides, whom he is described as having imitated. Prodicus came frequently to Athens for the purpose of transacting business on behalf of his native city, and attracted admiration as an orator, although his voice was deep and apt to fall. Plutarch describes him as slender and weak; and Plato also alludes to his weakness, and a degree of effeminacy which thus resulted. Philostratus accuses him of luxury and avarice, but no earlier source mentions this.

In the &quot;Protagoras&quot; of Plato, (dramatic date c. 430 BC), Prodicus is mentioned as having previously arrived in Athens. He appears in a play of Eupolis, and in &quot;The Clouds&quot; (423 BC) and &quot;The Birds&quot; (414 BC) of Aristophanes. He came frequently to Athens on public business. His pupils included the orators Theramenes and Isocrates, and in the year of the death of Socrates (399 BC), Prodicus was still living. According to the statement of Philostratus, on which little reliance can be placed, he delivered his lecture on virtue and vice in Thebes and Sparta also. The &quot;Apology&quot; of Plato unites him with Gorgias and Hippias as among those who were considered competent to instruct the youth in any city. Lucian mentions him among those who held lectures at Olympia.

In the dialogues of Plato he is mentioned or introduced with a certain degree of esteem, compared with the other sophists. In &quot;Meno&quot;, Socrates refers to him as his teacher. Aristophanes, in &quot;The Clouds&quot;, deals more indulgently with him than with Socrates; and Xenophon&#x27;s Socrates, for the purpose of combating the voluptuousness of Aristippus, borrows from the book of &quot;the wise Prodicus&quot; the story of the choice of Hercules. Like Protagoras and others, Prodicus delivered lectures in return for payment of from half a drachma to 50 drachmae, probably according to whether the hearers limited themselves to a single lecture or a more complete course. Prodicus is said to have amassed a great amount of money. The assertion that he hunted after rich young men is only found in Philostratus.

==Teachings==
Prodicus was part of the first generation of Sophists. &quot;He was a Sophist in the full sense of a professional freelance educator.&quot; As he taught both philosophy and politics, so Plato represents his instructions as chiefly ethical, and gives preference to his distinction of ideas, such as courage, rashness, boldness, over similar attempts of other sophists. He sometimes gave individual show-orations, and though known to Callimachus, they do not appear to have been long preserved. In contrast with Gorgias and others, who boasted of possessing the art of making the small appear great, the great small, and of expatiating in long or short speeches, Prodicus required that the speech should be neither long nor short, but of the proper measure, and it is only as associated with other sophists that he is charged with endeavouring to make the weaker cause appear strong by means of his rhetoric (thereby inspiring, &quot;e.g.&quot;, Milton&#x27;s description of Belial).

===Linguistics===
Several of Plato&#x27;s dialogues focus upon Prodicus&#x27; linguistic theory, and his insistence upon the correct use of names. He paid special attention to the correct use of words, and the distinction of expressions related in sense. In &quot;Meno&quot;, Plato has Socrates observe that Prodicus might more tightly distinguish certain words which Socrates was happy to treat as sharing broadly the same meaning. Thucydides is said to have gained from him his accuracy in the use of words. In the &quot;Cratylus&quot;, Socrates jokes that if he could have afforded the fifty drachma lectures he would now be an expert on &quot;the correctness of names&quot;. In several of the Platonic dialogues Socrates appears as the friend and companion of Prodicus, which reveals at least that the two did have close personal relations, and that Socrates did attend at least a few of his lectures. &quot;For Socrates, correct language was the prerequisite for correct living (including an efficient government). But Prodicus, though his linguistic teaching undoubtedly included semantic distinctions between ethical terms, had stopped at the threshold. The complete art of &quot;logoi&quot; embraced nothing less than the whole of philosophy.&quot;

===Ethics===

The speech on the choice of Hercules was entitled &quot;Horai&quot; (). Hercules, as he was entering manhood, had to choose one of the two paths of life, that of virtue and that of vice. There appeared two women, the one of dignified beauty, adorned with purity, modesty, and discretion, the other of a voluptuous form, and meretricious look and dress. The latter promises to lead him by the shortest road, without any toil, to the enjoyment of every pleasure. The other, while she reminds him of his progenitors and his noble nature, does not conceal from him that the gods have not granted what is really beautiful and good apart from trouble and careful striving. While one seeks to deter him from the path of virtue by urging the difficulty of it; the other calls attention to the unnatural character of enjoyment which anticipates the need of it, its want of the highest joy, that arising from noble deeds, and the consequences of a life of voluptuousness, and how she herself, honoured by gods and men, leads to all noble works, and to true well-being in all circumstances of life. Hercules decides for virtue. This outline in Xenophon probably represents, in a very abbreviated form, the leading ideas of the original, of which no fragments remain.

Another speech, apparently by Prodicus, is mentioned in the spurious Platonic dialogue &quot;Eryxias&quot;. Prodicus undertakes to show that the value of external goods depends simply upon the use which is made of them, and that virtue must be learnt. Similar sentiments were expressed in Prodicus&#x27;s &quot;Praise of Agriculture&quot;. The spurious dialogue &quot;Axiochus&quot; attributes to him views respecting the worthlessness of earthly life in different ages and callings, and how we must long after freedom from connection with the body in the heavenly and cognate aether. Also found here is a doctrine that death is not to be feared, as it affects neither the living nor the departed.

===Naturalism===
Prodicus, like some of his fellow Sophists, interpreted religion through the framework of naturalism. The gods he regarded as personifications of the sun, moon, rivers, fountains, and whatever else contributes to the comfort of our life, and he was sometimes charged with atheism. &quot;His theory was that primitive man was so impressed with the gifts nature provided him for the furtherance of his life that he believed them to be the discovery of gods or themselves to embody the godhead. This theory was not only remarkable for its naturalism but for its discernment of a close connection between religion and agriculture.&quot;

<text>Mehet-Weret or Mehturt () is an ancient Egyptian deity of the sky in ancient Egyptian religion. Her name means &quot;Great Flood&quot;.

She was mentioned in the Pyramid Texts. In ancient Egyptian creation myths, she gives birth to the sun at the beginning of time. In spell 17 of the Book of the Dead the god Ra is born from her buttocks. In art she is portrayed as a cow with a sun disk between her horns. She is associated with the goddesses Neith, Hathor, and Isis, all of whom have similar characteristics, and like them she could be called the &quot;Eye of Ra&quot;. In some instances she is simply an epithet for those goddesses. Her own titles included &#x27;mound&#x27; and &#x27;island&#x27;.

==Origin==
Mehet-Weret was responsible for raising the sun into the sky every day. She produced the light for the crops of those who worshipped her, and she also caused the annual Nile River flood that fertilized the crops with water. In Patricia Monaghan&#x27;s &quot;The Encyclopedia of Goddesses and Heroines&quot;, she describes Mehet-Weret as the goddess of creation because she gives birth to the sun every day, creating life for all those who worship her.

Geraldine Pinch suggests that Mehet-Weret was also &#x27;probably&#x27; the Milky Way in the night sky, to correspond with her identification as the celestial waters travelled by the solar barque.

==Physical description==
Mehet-Weret is depicted as either a cow-headed woman, a seated cow, or a cow carrying a child, often the golden disk of the sun is between her horns She appears on a golden bed found in the Tomb of Tutankhamun, the sides of which are made from star-patterned cows labelled as Isis-Mehet.

She is also featured twice on the sarcophagus of Khonsu, son of Sennedjem, who was buried in tomb TT1 during the Nineteenth Dynasty. In both instances she appears as a seated cow with the sun between her horns. She is depicted dressed in a number of ritual items as a way to denote her divine standing; a flail rises out of her back. In one image Khonsu is depicted bowing and adoring her, in the other a small Horus head lies in front of her on her dais.

==Death and afterlife==
The goddess Mehet-Weret was featured in a number of spells in the Book of the Dead, including spell 17. In this spell she was credited for the birth of Re, and she is also the one who protects Re, because it was believed by the ancient people of Egypt that the sun died every day and was reborn by Mehet-Weret. She was responsible for taking him into the underworld, or night because of the darkness, and then bringing him back to the world the next day, almost as if in the afterlife. The people of Egypt believed that Mehet-Weret was a goddess of creation and rebirth, so she was featured in one of the spells to help the humans make their way into the afterlife. The Book of the Dead is an important text in the Egyptian culture because it allows the audience to understand the different journeys that the ancient Egyptians believed in to get to the afterlife.

<text>Mendes (, &quot;gen&quot;.: ), the Greek name of the ancient Egyptian city of Djedet, also known in ancient Egypt as Per-Banebdjedet (&quot;The Domain of the Ram Lord of Djedet&quot;) and Anpet, is known today as Tell El-Ruba ().

The city is located in the eastern Nile delta () and was the capital of the 16th Lower Egyptian nome of Kha, until it was replaced by Thmuis in Greco-Roman Egypt. The two cities are only several hundred meters apart. During the 29th Dynasty, Mendes was also the capital of Ancient Egypt, lying on the Mendesian branch of the Nile (now silted up), about 35 km east of al-Mansurah.

==History==
In ancient times, Mendes was a famous city that attracted the notice of most ancient geographers and historians, including Herodotus (ii. 42, 46. 166), Diodorus (i. 84), Strabo (xvii. p. 802), Mela (i. 9 § 9), Pliny the Elder (v. 10. s. 12), Ptolemy (iv. 5. § 51), and Stephanus of Byzantium (&quot;s. v.&quot;). The city was the capital of the Mendesian nome, situated at the point where the Mendesian arm of the Nile (, Scylax, p. 43; Ptol. iv, 5. § 10; &quot;Mendesium ostium&quot;, Pliny, Mela, &quot;ll. cc.&quot;) flows into the lake of Tanis. Archaeological evidence attests to the existence of the town at least as far back as the Naqada II period (4th millennium BCE). Under the first Pharaohs, Mendes quickly became a strong seat of provincial government and remained so throughout the Ancient Egyptian period. In Classical times, the nome it governed was one of the nomes assigned to that division of the native army which was called the &quot;Calasires&quot;, and the city was celebrated for the manufacture of a perfume designated as the Mendesium unguentum. (Plin. xiii. 1. s. 2.) Mendes, however, declined early, and disappears in the first century AD; since both Ptolemy (&quot;l. c.&quot;) and P. Aelius Aristides (iii. p. 160) mention Thmuis as the only town of note in the Mendesian nome. From its position at the junction of the river and the lake, it was probably encroached upon by their waters, after the canals fell into neglect under the Macedonian kings, and when they were repaired by Augustus (Sueton. &quot;Aug.&quot; 18, 63) Thmuis had attracted its trade and population.

==Religion==
The chief deities of Mendes were the ram deity Banebdjedet (lit. &quot;Ba of the Lord of Djedet&quot;), who was the Ba of Osiris, and his , the fish goddess Hatmehit. With their child Har-pa-khered (&quot;Horus the Child&quot;), they formed the triad of Mendes.

The ram deity of Mendes was described by Herodotus in his &quot;Histories&quot; as being represented with the head and fleece of a goat: &quot;...whereas anyone with a sanctuary of Mendes or who comes from the province of Mendes, will have nothing to do with (sacrificing) goats, but uses sheep as his sacrificial animals... They say that Heracles&#x27; overriding desire was to see Zeus, but Zeus was refusing to let him do so. Eventually, as a result of Heracles&#x27; pleading, Zeus came up with a plan. He skinned a ram and cut off his head, then he held the head in front of himself, wore the fleece, and showed himself to Heracles like that. That is why the Egyptian statues of Zeus have a ram&#x27;s head, is why rams are sacred to the Thebans, and they do not use them as sacrificial animals. However there is just one day of the year—the day of the festival of Zeus—when they chop up a single ram, skin it, dress the statue of Zeus in the way mentioned, and then bring the statue of Heracles up close to the statue of Zeus. Then everyone around the sanctuary mourns the death of the ram and finally they bury it in a sacred tomb.&quot;

Demonologists in early modern times often imagined Satan as manifesting himself as a goat or satyr, because goats had a reputation for lustful behavior and were used in the iconography of pre-Christian gods like Pan and the goat of Mendes. The occultist Eliphas Levi in his &quot;Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie&quot; (1855) drew an image of the fictitious medieval idol Baphomet that conflated it with the goat of Mendes and the imagery of the Satanic satyr. The image of the satyr-like Baphomet and its supposed connection with Mendes has since been repeated by various occultists, conspiracy theorists, and neopagans.

==Ruins==

The site is today the largest surviving tell in the Nile delta, and consists of both Tell El-Ruba (the site of the main temple enclosure) and Tell El-Timai (the settlement site of Thmuis to the south). Overall, Mendes is about 3 km long from north to south and averages about 900m east-to-west. An Old Kingdom necropolis is estimated to contain over 9,000 interments. Several campaigns of 20th-century excavations have been led by North American institutions, including New York University and the University of Toronto, as well as a Pennsylvania State University team led by Donald Redford. Under the direction of Redford, the current excavations are concentrating on a number of areas in and around the main temple. 

Work on the New Kingdom processional-style temple has recently uncovered foundation deposits of Merenptah below the second pylon. It is thought that four separate pylons or gates existed for each of the Avatars of the main deity worshiped here. Evidence has suggested that their construction dates from at least the Middle Kingdom, as foundation deposits were uncovered. The original structures were buried, added to, or incorporated into later ones over time by later rulers. 

A cemetery of sacred rams was discovered in the northwest corner of Tell El-Ruba. Monuments bearing the names of Ramesses II, Merneptah, and Ramesses III were also found. A temple attested by its foundation deposits was built by Amasis II. The tomb of Nepherites I, which Donald Redford concluded was destroyed by the Persians, was discovered by a joint team from the University of Washington and the University of Toronto in 1992–1993. 

On the edge of the temple mound, a sondage supervised by Matthew J. Adams has revealed uninterrupted stratification from the Middle Kingdom down to the First Dynasty. Coring results suggest that future excavations in that sondage should expect to take the stratification down into the Buto-Maadi Period. The material excavated so far is already the longest uninterrupted stratification for all of the Nile Delta, and possibly for all of Egypt.

<text>In Egyptian mythology, Meret (also spelled Mert) was a goddess who was strongly associated with rejoicing, such as singing and dancing.

==In myth==

Meret was a token wife occasionally given to Hapi, the god of the Nile flood. Her name being a reference to this, meaning simply &quot;the beloved&quot;. As token wife, she was usually depicted with the same associations as Hapi, having on her head either the blue lotus for Upper Egypt, or the papyrus plant for Lower Egypt. Since Hapi was the source of bountifulness, Meret was usually depicted with an offering bowl, as she was seen, being his wife, as the symbolic recipient of his generosity.

Among the lower classes, where nationalism was less important than successful harvest, she was more strongly considered the wife of Hapi than the protectresses of Lower and Upper Egypt, which were more normally his wife in the upper classes. As a deity whose role was to be the symbolic receiver of bounty from the inundation of the Nile, she was strongly associated with rejoicing, such as singing and dancing. Later stories tell that Meret was the goddess of the eighth hour, in the &quot;Book of Gates.&quot;

<text>Meretseger (also known as Mersegrit&#x27; or Mertseger) was a Theban cobra-goddess in ancient Egyptian religion, in charge with guarding and protecting the vast Theban Necropolis — on the west bank of the Nile, in front of Thebes — and especially the heavily guarded Valley of the Kings. Her cult was typical of the New Kingdom of Egypt (1550–1070 BC).

== Role and characteristics ==

Meretseger&#x27;s name means &quot;She Who Loves Silence&quot;, in reference to the silence of the desert cemetery area she kept or, according to another interpretation, &quot;Beloved of Him Who Makes Silence (Osiris)&quot;.

Meretseger was the patron of the artisans and workers of the village of Deir el-Medina, who built and decorated the great royal and noble tombs. Desecrations of rich royal burials were already in progress from the Old Kingdom of Egypt (27th/22nd century BC), sometimes by the workers themselves: the genesis of Meretseger was the spontaneous need to identify a guardian goddess, both dangerous and merciful, of the tombs of sovereigns and aristocrats. Her cult, also present in Esna (near Luxor), reached its peak during the 18th Dynasty. A royal wife of the Middle Kingdom pharaoh Senusret III (c. 1878–1839 BC) was called Meretseger; she was the first to bear the title Great Royal Wife (which became the standard title for chief wives of Pharaohs) and the first whose name was written in a cartouche: however, as there are no contemporary sources relating to the Great Royal Wife Meretseger, this homonym of the goddess is most likely a creation of the New Kingdom.

The goddess Meretseger was worshiped by the workers&#x27; guild, who feared her wrath very much. Being a local deity, only small rock temples were dedicated to her (such as the one located on the path leading to the Valley of the Queens) and some stelae with prayers and poignant requests for forgiveness, as well as various right at the foot of the hill dedicated to her — which was her embodiment too. She was sometimes associated with Hathor: even the latter was considered a protector of the graves in her funerary aspects of &quot;Lady Of The West&quot; and &quot;Lady Of The Necropolis&quot; who opened the gates of the underworld. Her close association with the Valley of the Kings prevented her becoming anything more than a local deity, and when the valley ceased being in use (and Thebes was abandoned as a capital), so she also ceased being worshipped (11th/10th century BC).
=== Meretseger&#x27;s hill ===

Meretseger was especially associated with the hill now called el Qurn &quot;The Horn&quot; ( &quot;The Peak&quot;), a natural peak, the highest point (420 m) in the Theban Hills, which dramatically overlooks the Valley of the Kings. It has an almost pyramidal shape when viewed from the entrance to the Valley of the Kings, and therefore some Egyptologists believe it may have been the reason for choosing the location as a royal necropolis. El Qurn, also believed to be one of the entrances to the Duat (underworld), was sacred to both Meretseger and Hathor, but the former was considered its real personification. For this reason, two of Meretseger&#x27;s many epithets were &quot;Peak of the West&quot; (&quot;Dehent-Imentet&quot;) and &quot;Lady Of The Peak&quot;. Many small stelae created by artisans and workers have been found as evidence of devotion to their favorite deities: in addition to Meretseger, Ptah, Amun, Hathor, Thoth and the deified pharaoh Amenhotep I (c. 1525–1504 BC), whose cult was very popular in Deir el-Medina.

=== Stela of Neferabu ===

It was believed that Meretseger punished the workers who committed a sacrilege (by stealing something from the royal graves or the building sites — copper instruments were particularly precious — as well as those who failed in an oath) poisoning them with her bite. But she was also considered generous in forgiving those who repented to her and, in this case, would heal him from physical evil. This is the case of the draftsman Neferabu, who would have been cured of blindness after having begged Meretseger, as he himself was able to attest on a limestone stela (Museo egizio, Turin) dedicated to her:In relation to the Egyptians with their divinities, the concepts of sin, repentance and forgiveness were very unusual; these characteristics of Meretseger&#x27;s cult appear to be a &quot;unicum&quot;.

=== Rock shrine in Deir el-Medina ===
Meretseger&#x27;s rock shrine in Deir el-Medina was formed by a series of caves placed in a semicircle, whose vaults however collapsed due to earthquakes, and on the outer walls still retains many steles, while a large number of fragments have been inventoried and distributed to various museums. It was also dedicated to the most revered Ptah, god of craftsmen and artisans. Overlying the temple there is a rock with the shape of a snake&#x27;s head. The large amount of material found confirms that the temple was very popular and famous — locally.
=== Iconography ===
Meretseger was sometimes portrayed as a cobra-headed woman, though this iconography is rather rare: in this case she could hold the &quot;was&quot;-sceptre as well as having her head surmounted by a feather and being armed with two knives. More commonly, she was depicted as a woman-headed snake or scorpion, a cobra-headed sphinx, lion-headed cobra or three-headed (woman, snake and vulture) cobra. On various steles, she wears a modius surmounted by the solar disk and by two feathers, or the hathoric crown (the solar disk between two bovine horns). Her main artistic depictions are inside lavish royal tombs, for example:

* the tomb (TT56) of Userhat, &quot;Scribe who Counts the Bread for Upper And Lower Egypt&quot; under Pharaoh Amenhotep II (1427–1401 BC), where she appears with Montu;
* the tomb (KV14) of Queen Twosret (c. 1191–1189 BC) and Pharaoh Setnakhte (c. 1189–1186 BC), where she appears genuflected;
* the tomb (KV9) of Pharaoh Ramesses VI (c. 1144–1136 BC), where she appears, along with Khonsu, Amun-ra, Ptah-Sokar and Ra-Horakhty, receiving offerings by the King himself;
* the tomb (KV18) of Pharaoh Ramesses X (c. 1111–1107 BC), where she appears with Ra-Horakhty;
* the tomb (KV4) of Pharaoh Ramesses XI (c. 1107–1077 BC), where she appears with many deities.

<doc id="98387" wikidata="Q58976" url="?curid=98387" title="Piraeus">
<text>Piraeus ( ; ; ; , ) is a port city within the Athens urban area (&quot;Greater Athens&quot;), in the Attica region of Greece. It is located southwest of Athens city centre along the east coast of the Saronic Gulf in the Athens Riviera.

The municipality of Piraeus and four other suburban municipalities form the regional unit of Piraeus, sometimes called the Greater Piraeus area, with a total population of 448,051. At the 2021 census, Piraeus had a population of 168,151 people, making it the fifth largest municipality in Greece and the second largest (after the municipality of Athens) within the Athens urban area.

Piraeus has a long recorded history, dating back to ancient Greece. The city was founded in the early 5th century BC, when plans to make it the new port of Athens were implemented: A prototype harbour was constructed, which resulted in concentrating in one location all the import and transit trade of Athens, along with the navy&#x27;s base. During the Golden Age of Athens, the Long Walls were constructed to fortify the route from the main settlement to the port (Piraeus). During the classical period, the naval base in Piraeus had 372 trireme shipsheds. Beginning in the 3rd century B.C., Piraeus went into a period of cumulative decline. However, it began growing once again in the 19th century, after Athens was made the capital of Greece. Today, Piraeus is a large city, bustling with activity, and an integral part of Athens. It is a huge marine and commercial-industrial centre, and home to Greece&#x27;s largest harbour.

The port of Piraeus is the chief port in Greece, the 5th largest passenger port in Europe and the 24th largest passenger port in the world serving about 4.37 million passengers annually in 2020. With a throughput of 5.44 million TEUs, Piraeus is among the busiest ten ports in Europe in terms of container traffic, and is the busiest container port in the Eastern Mediterranean. The city hosted events in both the 1896 and 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens. The University of Piraeus is one of the largest universities in Greece, and includes the country&#x27;s second-oldest business school, as well as the oldest academic department dedicated to the study of finance.

==History==
===Ancient and medieval times===
Piraeus has been inhabited since at least the 26th century BC. Piraeus is a rocky outcropping on the Greek coast that features the steep hill of Munichia and modern-day Kastella. Although long connected to the mainland by a land bridge that is consistently above water, Piraeus in prehistoric times was an island connected to the mainland only by a low-lying stretch of land that was flooded by sea water most of the year. Whenever the land bridge dried up, it was used as a salt field (its ancient name, the Halipedon, means the &#x27;salt field&#x27;), and its muddy soil made for a tricky passage. Over time, however, the area became increasingly silted, high, and dry—and flooding ceased—so that, by early classical times, the land passage could be safely crossed at all times. Thus in ancient Greece, Piraeus assumed increased importance because of its three deep-water harbours: the main port of Cantharus and the two smaller ports, Zea and Munichia. The Piraeus harbours gradually replaced the older and shallower Phaleron harbour, which fell into disuse.

In the late 6th and early 5th centuries BC, the area became the focus of strategic and political improvements due to its natural advantages. For example, in 511 BC, the hill of Munichia was fortified by Hippias, and four years later Piraeus was made a deme of Athens by Cleisthenes. According to the ancient Greek historian Thucydides, in 493 BC, Themistocles initiated fortification works in Piraeus, and later advised the Athenians to take advantage of its natural harbours&#x27; strategic potential instead of using the sandy bay of Phaleron. A duty of 2 percent was levied on goods passing through the port. These were very effective at raising funds for the city of Athens. In the year 399 after the Peloponnesian War, for example, the city had collected 1,800 talents in harbour dues despite economic effects of the war.

In 483 BC, a new silver vein was discovered in the Laurion mines, and the profit from mining that silver was utilized to fund the construction of 200 triremes; the Athenian fleet was transferred to Piraeus, and the triremes were built in its shipyards. The Athenian fleet played a crucial role in the battle of Salamis against the Persians in 480 BC. From then on, Piraeus was permanently used as the navy&#x27;s base. After the second Persian invasion of Greece, Themistocles fortified the three harbours of Piraeus and created the &quot;neosoikoi&quot; (ship houses); the Themistoclean Walls were completed in 471 BC, transforming Piraeus into a great military and commercial harbour. The city&#x27;s fortifications were later further improved by the construction of the Long Walls under Cimon and Pericles, which secured the route from Piraeus and its ports to the main city of Athens. Meanwhile, Piraeus was rebuilt, based on the famous grid plan of architect Hippodamus of Miletus, known as the Hippodamian plan. (The main agora of the city was named after him in honour of this achievement.) As a result, Piraeus flourished, becoming a highly secure port with booming commercial activity, and a city bustling with life.

In the second year of the Peloponnesian War, Piraeus suffered its first setback when the Athens plague spread to it. In 429, the Spartans ravaged Salamis as part of an abortive attack on the Piraeus. But when the Athenians responded by sending a fleet to investigate, the Spartan alliance forces fled. In 404 BC, the Spartan fleet under Lysander blockaded Piraeus, and subsequently Athens surrendered to the Spartans, putting an end to the Delian League and the war itself. Piraeus was to suffer the same fate as Athens and bear the brunt of the Spartans&#x27; rage, as the city&#x27;s walls and the Long Walls were torn down; the Athenian fleet surrendered to the victors, some of the triremes were burnt, and the &quot;neosoikoi&quot; were pulled down. As a result, the tattered and unfortified port city was not able to compete with prosperous Rhodes, which became the dominant commercial force in the region. In 403 BC, Munichia was seized by Thrasybulus and the exiles from Phyle, in the battle of Munichia, where the Phyleans defeated the Thirty Tyrants of Athens, but in the following battle of Piraeus the exiles were defeated by Spartan forces.

After the reinstatement of democracy, a general Conon rebuilt the walls in 393 BC, founded the temple of Aphrodite Euploia and the sanctuary of Zeus Sotiros and Athena, and built the famous Skeuotheke (arsenal) of Philon, the ruins of which have been discovered at Zea harbour. The reconstruction of Piraeus went on during the period of Alexander the Great, but this revival of the town was quashed by Roman Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who captured and totally destroyed Piraeus in 86 BC. The destruction was completed in 395 AD by the Goths under Alaric I. Piraeus was led to a long period of decline which lasted for fifteen centuries. During the Byzantine period the harbour of Piraeus was occasionally used for the Byzantine fleet, but it was very far from the capital city of Constantinople.

In the Middle Ages, the port was usually called by the Venetians the &quot;port of Sithines&quot; (that is, of Athens) and in the 14th century, the name &quot;Lion&quot; is first attested, after the colossal ancient sculpture of a lion, the Piraeus Lion, which stood at the harbour&#x27;s entrance. This later become &quot;Porto Leone&quot; (Πόρτο Λεόνε). It was also called &quot;Porto Drako&quot; (Πόρτο Δράκο) by Greeks, &quot;drako&quot; meaning not just &quot;dragon&quot;, but any monster.

===Ottoman period===

When Piraeus was taken by the Ottoman Empire in 1456, it became known as &quot;Aslan Liman&quot; (&quot;Lion Harbour&quot;), a translation of the existing Venetian name.

The Piraeus Lion itself was looted in 1687 by Francesco Morosini during his expedition against Athens (part of the Morean War) and was carried to the Venetian Arsenal, where it still stands today. A copy of the lion statue is on display at the Archaeological Museum of Piraeus.

Under Ottoman rule, especially before the beginning of the Greek War of Independence, Piraeus was mostly deserted, except for the monastery of Saint Spyridon (1590) and a customs house, and it was only used occasionally as a commercial port. Although there were numerous land owners, Athenians did not live in the area.

There were at least two failed attempts to create a new town, the first in 1792 by bringing a population from Hydra and the second during the Greek War of Independence in 1825 by the installation of people from Psara, but it was not until 1829 that permanent habitation of the area was restarted. Piraeus at first developed into a small town with few dwellings, far from its glorious past as a prosperous city, with its population consisting largely of fishermen.

===Modern era===

With the creation of the modern Greek state and the proclamation of Athens as its capital in 1832, the port, still named Πόρτο Λεόνε &quot;Porto Leone&quot; or Πόρτο Δράκο &quot;Porto Draco&quot;, again acquired a reason for growth, and began to develop into a commercial and industrial centre. Migrants, mainly from the Aegean Islands, continued to arrive. A town plan was also drawn up and approved by King Otto, but not completely fulfilled, as it was revolutionary for its time.

The municipality was established in 1835, reviving the ancient name &quot;Piraeus&quot;. Following petitions from the new and emerging prosperous bourgeoisie, municipal elections were held to elect a mayor for the city, Kyriakos Serfiotis of Hydra. Piraeus had around 300 inhabitants at this time.

Piraeus, from a deserted small town, quickly became the leading port and the second largest city in Greece, with its prime geographical location and closeness to the Greek capital helping it continually to grow, attracting people from across the country. A number of events contributed to the development of the city; among these were its ultimate declaration as the leading port of Greece, the completion of the Athens-Piraeus Railway in 1869, the industrial development of the area in the 1860s, and the creation of the Corinth Canal in 1893, all of which left Piraeus more strategically important than ever. New buildings were constructed to cover the necessities of this growth, such as educational institutions, churches, the Stock Exchange Building, the Town Hall, the Central Market, the Post Office Building and charity institutions; the port was also supplemented and modernised, with dredging operations, the construction of the Royal Landing, the Troumba Pier and the quay-ways up to the Customs House area, the commencement of construction work on the Outer Moles and the completion of permanent dry-docks. At the end of the 19th century, Piraeus had a population of 51,020 people.

The establishment of the Port Committee in 1911, which controlled the works of construction and maintenance of the port, and the Piraeus Port Authority in 1930, which made a more efficient job of managing a port slowly increasing in traffic, played a catalytic role in the city&#x27;s development. The town flourished and neo-classical buildings were erected; one of them, which continues to ornament the present town, is the Piraeus Municipal Theatre, an excellent example of the area&#x27;s once wider neoclassical architecture. After the decisive period for Greece of 1912–1922, Piraeus experienced a major demographic explosion, with its population almost doubling to reach 251,659 in 1928 from 133,482 in 1920, an increase owed to the arrival of Greek refugees from Asia Minor after the 1919–1922 Greco-Turkish War and the Greek genocide in Anatolia and finally the subsequent population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Although there was an increase in the labour force, a variety of social problems also emerged with the concentration of new populations in the suburbs of the city, such as Nikaia, Keratsini, Perama, Drapetsona and Korydallos.

The involvement of Greece in World War II came as a major setback to the city&#x27;s progress. After the war, the city began its development once more, as damage to the port and the city were repaired and new additions took shape after 1955. Piraeus is now the fifth largest municipality in Greece; the city proper with its suburbs form the Piraeus urban area, which is incorporated in the Athens urban area, thus making Piraeus an integral part of the Greek capital. The port of Piraeus is now an important international port, and the largest in the country.

==Geography==
Piraeus is situated in the southwest part of the central plain of Attica, also widely known as the &quot;Attica Basin&quot;, which the Athens urban area (or agglomeration) sprawls across. Piraeus is bounded by the Mount Aigaleo to the northwest, and the Saronic Gulf to the south and west, and connected with the rest of the Athens urban area to the east and northeast. The &quot;city proper&quot; of Piraeus consists of a rocky peninsula, originally an island, featuring three natural harbours. In addition to the central one, called Kantharos in ancient times, the smaller harbours to the east are still in use: Zea, also known as &quot;Pasalimani&quot;, and Munichia, the smallest of the three and widely known as &quot;Mikrolimano&quot; and &quot;Tourkolimano &quot;. Nowadays, the Greater Piraeus includes the harbours of Drapetsona, Keratsini and Perama. The central harbour is a hub of commercial and passenger shipping, whereas the two smaller ones cater to recreational and fishing craft. The municipality has an area of 10.865 km2.

===Climate===

Under Köppen climate classification Piraeus has a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;) and according to the Hellenic National Meteorological Service climate atlas it is the only area in Attica, Greece that clearly falls into this climate category. Due to summer night land breezes in Athens, Piraeus records high minimum summer temperatures while the mean annual temperature stands at .
During July 2024 minimum temperatures remained over 30 °C (86 °F) for 12 consecutive days in Piraeus, breaking all known records for any area in the country. 



==Demography==
Piraeus is the fifth most populous municipality in Greece with an official population of 168,151 (in 2021). The Greater Piraeus, part of the greater Athens urban area, comprises the city proper (municipality of Piraeus) and four other suburban municipalities, having a total population of 448,051 people (in 2021).

The table below shows the historical population of Piraeus and Piraeus regional unit in recent times.

==Culture==

===Archaeological sites===

Among the archaeological sites of Piraeus, parts of the ancient Themistoclean Walls and Eëtioneia, a mole in the entrance to the harbour, are still preserved in good condition. Excavations in Pasalimani revealed the &quot;Skeuotheke&quot;, an ancient structure where ship rigging equipment was stored, designed by architect Philon. In Kastella the &quot;Syrangion&quot; is to be found, which probably served as a sanctuary to the local hero &quot;Syrango&quot;, and the Cave of Arethusa, both prehistoric. Ruins of the ancient city at the basement of the cathedral of Agia Triada and the ancient Theater of Zea next to the Archaeological Museum, the ancient &quot;neosoikoi&quot; in Zea, Munichia and Kantharos navy yard, can also be seen.

====Bronze statues====
The discovery of four bronze statues at a construction site near the Tinaneios Gardens in Piraeus, Greece on July 18, 1959 is still remembered by an entire generation as a momentous discovery in Modern Greek archaeology. The statues are now featured in the Piraeus Museum, and are largely responsible for the creation of the modern Archaeological Museum of Piraeus. While drilling in order to lay pipes, the Hydrex Company came across the hand of a bronze &quot;kouros&quot; (youth) at a depth of approximately 1.50 meters. Excavations began after the custodian of the local museum, Dimitrios Kalantonis, and the Director of the Archaeological Service, Yiannis Papdimitriou, were informed. Four noteworthy bronze statues were uncovered in the continuing excavations – the Archaic Apollo (the &quot;kouros&quot; whose hand had originally been seen), the large Artemis, a smaller Artemis, and a larger-than-life Athena. However, the enthusiasm for the dig led to poor documentation of the details and context of the finds, leaving rare photos taken by the media or public as the only record. There are multiple theories as to how the statues came to be carefully arranged within what is thought to have been a small square room. When and why the statues were apparently hidden is open to debate, along with their origins, date, and style. One early theory suggests that the statues had been stored near the harbour with the intention of being shipped to Italy; however, the presence of coins near the statues dating from a period of war opens up another possibility – that the statues were hidden for safe keeping, and then lost when the building was destroyed. Dating the concealment of the statues is another issue, as they may have been buried anytime between the 1st century BC and the 3rd century AD. The statue of the &quot;kouros&quot; was recognized to be of Apollo, and dated to the 5th century BC. The other three female statues, from the 4th century BC, show a different, more human, form of sculpture that sets them apart from their older companion.

===Leisure and entertainment===
Piraeus provides a wide variety of entertainment. There are a lot of tavernas and restaurants in Piraeus, renowned for their cuisine. Most are spread along the coasts of Mikrolimano and Piraiki, specializing in seafood and attracting many visitors, including tourists. The nightlife of the city is vibrant, with numerous bars and nightclubs. Plenty of major shopping areas can be found on the central avenues of Piraeus, Iroon Polytechneiou and Grigoriou Labraki.

In the summer, the Maritime Festival take place, while the Three Kings&#x27; Way Festival marks the beginning of the carnival, with all the associated costumes and entertainment.

The Municipal Theater has been the center of the arts in Piraeus, hosting a variety of cultural events including theater, dance and music events. The open air Veakeio Theater in Kastella is a popular destination during the summer and hosts concerts, folk music bands and Greek and foreign troupes, while the Menandreio Theater, widely known as Delfinario, is popular for hosting variety shows. Village Park, a large multipurpose center and part of the Village Cinemas built in suburban Agios Ioannis Renti, attracts a large number of people from the whole of Athens, offering a diversity of shops, cafes, and restaurant, in addition to the twenty cinemas making it the largest cinema complex in Greece. Next to it, the Allou Fun Park is the most recent and largest amusement theme park in Athens, offering its numerous rides and attractions, restaurants and pastry shops.

===Museums===
Piraeus is home to several museums and other institutions of great interest within their field. The Archaeological Museum of Piraeus displays objects from classical antiquity found at the area of Piraeus and the greater coastal zone, typical of the history and culture of the ancient city. The city also houses the Hellenic Maritime Museum, with exhibits relating to the nautical tradition of Greece, the Merchant Shipping History Institute Exhibition, the Panos Aravantinos Decor Museum and the Museum of Electric Railways, hosted in the Piraeus station. The Municipal Art Gallery and the Municipal Library, one of the largest in Greece, are also prominent within the culture of Piraeus.

===Sport===

Traditionally, Piraeus has played a major role in Greek sport. The city boasts one of the most popular and one of the most prestigious Greek multisport clubs, Olympiacos CFP. The other major club is Ethnikos Piraeus, with a long athletic tradition, while other historic clubs are Atromitos Piraeus F.C. and Peiraikos Syndesmos.

In football, Olympiacos F.C. is the most successful football club in Greece, having won by far more titles than any other Greek football club, and its ground is at the Karaiskakis Stadium, in Neo Faliro. Ethnikos Piraeus F.C. had a longstanding presence in Super League Greece and also used the Karaiskakis Stadium as home ground, but in recent years the club has competed in lower divisions and currently plays home matches at the Helleniko Stadium, in Ellinikon. In basketball, Olympiacos B.C. is the only major club from Piraeus, one of the most successful at domestic and European level, and its home arena is the Peace and Friendship Stadium, while the volleyball department of the same club, Olympiacos S.C., is the dominant domestically and has made great success in European competitions as well. Piraeus rides really high in water polo, where Ethnikos Piraeus and Olympiacos departments have entirely dominated in Greece; the first is considered the &quot;Emperor&quot; of the sport and the latter is the only Greek water polo club to have been crowned European Champion.

First class sporting facilities can be found in Piraeus. The Karaiskakis Stadium, built in 1885 as a bicycle track, enlarged in 1964 and completely rebuilt in 2004, is the second largest football venue in Greece with a capacity of 33,334 and one of the most modern in Europe. It hosted the 1971 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final and several games of the football tournament in the 2004 Summer Olympics, while it was used as a velodrome in the 1896 Summer Olympics. The Peace and Friendship Stadium, part of the Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Complex and built in 1985 opposite to the Karaiskakis Stadium, is the second largest indoor arena in the country and one of the most impressive around Europe, having hosted multiply major international events in several sports, including the volleyball tournament in the 2004 Athens Olympics, the 1998 FIBA World Championship, the EuroBasket 1987 and the Final Four of the Euroleague 1993.

==Maritime industry==

In addition to being the largest marine–based shipping centre of Greece, Piraeus is also the commercial hub of Greek shipping, with most of Greece&#x27;s shipowners having offices there, largely centred around the street Akti Miaouli. In its capacities as host to Greek shipping, Piraeus has been affected significantly by the various governments of Greece. Following World War II, the Greek government attempted to nationalize the proceeds of the insurance payments given to Greek shipowners who had lost vessels as a result of those vessels having been commandeered by the Allied Forces; the insurance had been provided by Lloyd&#x27;s of London and guaranteed by the coalition of the allied forces. Although Greek shipowners ultimately won their case against the Greek government in the British courts, most were uninterested in continuing to base their headquarters in Piraeus, both out of distrust of the Greek government, and because the war had left the Greater Athens area in a state of severe poverty. As a result, Greece&#x27;s shipowners left Piraeus en masse in favour of operations in London, New York, Alexandria and other major shipping cities.

Today the port of Piraeus ranks 7th in Europe and the 1st in the Mediterranean in terms of TEUs transported through it each year.

===1967 military junta===

In 1967, when a group of colonels staged a coup d&#x27;état against the government, in order to increase desperately needed revenues, the junta offered lavish incentives for Greek shipowners to bring their companies back to Piraeus. This included both tax incentives and other inducements, as highlighted by the fact that Aristotle Onassis was allowed to purchase the entire island of Skorpios, which otherwise would have been a violation of Greek coastline laws.

=== 1974 democratic government ===
After the junta fell in 1974, the successive democratic government generally maintained the deregulation of Greek-based shipping, and many shipowners have maintained commercial operations there since. Today, however, as a result of traffic congestion plaguing the Athens area, and the fact that most shipowners reside in the lavish northern suburbs of Athens, many shipowners have opted once again to move their bases away from Piraeus to Northern Athens.

=== Shipping today ===
After the post-2008 financial crisis collapse of global shipping, the port was gradually acquired by China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO), which is a Chinese state-owned enterprise. Under COSCO, Piraeus has become a busy port, rising from traffic of 400,000 containers in 2008 to nearly five million containers in 2018. Most European trade with China occurs via Greek ships, including through Piraeus.

With an annual number of 8,1 million passengers by 2015, Piraeus also became the EU&#x27;s sixth-largest port in terms of passenger transportation. The central port serves ferry routes to almost every island in the eastern portion of Greece, the island of Crete, the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, and much of the northern and the eastern Aegean Sea, while the western part of the port is used for cargo services. The following operators serve the port:
* Minoan Lines
* ANEK Lines
* Blue Star Ferries
* Hellenic Seaways
* Celestyal Cruises
* Monarch Classic Cruises

==Transport==
Piraeus is served by buses and trolleybuses (OSY), Suburban Railway, the Metro Lines 1 and 3 and the Athens Tram. Piraeus station refers to the two railway stations (Metro, and Suburban Railway) located next to the seaport.

==Landmarks==
Piraeus is marked by the diversity of culture among its neighbourhoods. The hill of Kastella is one of the most prosperous and attractive neighbourhoods, with a panoramic view over Athens basin and the Saronic Gulf. Its elegance comes from its numerous neo-classical mansions, while the Veakeio Theater and a church dedicated to the Prophet Elijah are the most popular buildings. The coastal area of Neo Faliro has been upgraded and is also prominent, with the Peace and Friendship Stadium and the Karaiskakis Stadium, an indoor arena and a football ground respectively lying opposite one another, predominating. Mikrolimano and Bay of Zea, are the smaller harbours of Piraeus acts as Marinas, attract large numbers of visitors with their picturesque vistas and vigorous nightlife. Kaminia, by contrast, is a working-class neighbourhood which still preserves the traditional look of an earlier period. The Municipal Theater in the center of Piraeus was built in 1885 and remains an impressive neo-classical building. Located across from the Neo-Byzantine Piraeus Cathedral, it forms one of the most renowned landmarks of the city and a popular meeting place.

Rondini Square is an archaeological site which forms part of the ancient city of Piraeus.

<text>In ancient Egyptian mythology, Meskhenet, (also spelt Mesenet, Meskhent, and Meshkent) was the goddess of childbirth, and the creator of each child&#x27;s Ka, a part of their soul, which she breathed into them at the moment of birth. She was worshipped from the earliest of times by Egyptians.

==In mythology==

In ancient Egypt, women delivered babies while squatting on a pair of bricks, known as &quot;birth bricks&quot;, and Meskhenet was the goddess associated with this form of delivery. Consequently, in art, she was sometimes depicted as a brick with a woman&#x27;s head, wearing a cow&#x27;s uterus upon it. At other times she was depicted as a woman with a symbolic cow&#x27;s uterus on her headdress.

Since she was responsible for creating the Ka, she was associated with fate. Thus later she was sometimes said to be paired with Shai, who became a god of destiny after the deity evolved out of an abstract concept.

Meskhenet features prominently in the last of the folktales in the Westcar Papyrus. The story tells of the birth of Userkaf, Sahure, and Neferirkare Kakai, the first three kings of the Fifth Dynasty, who in the story are said to be triplets. Just after each child is born, Meskhenet appears and prophesies that he will become king of Egypt.

<text>United States Numbered Highways are the components of a national system of highways administered by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), a nonprofit, nonpartisan association, and the various state departments of transportation.

There are several U.S. Highways that exist entirely within one state.

<doc id="98394" wikidata="Q179785" url="?curid=98394" title="Gorgias">
<text>Gorgias ( ; ; – ) was an ancient Greek sophist, pre-Socratic philosopher, and rhetorician who was a native of Leontinoi in Sicily. Several doxographers report that he was a pupil of Empedocles, although he would only have been a few years younger. W. K. C. Guthrie writes that &quot;Like other Sophists, he was an itinerant that practiced in various cities and giving public exhibitions of his skill at the great pan-Hellenic centers of Olympia and Delphi, and charged fees for his instruction and performances. A special feature of his displays was to ask miscellaneous questions from the audience and give impromptu replies.&quot; He has been called &quot;Gorgias the Nihilist&quot;, although the degree to which this epithet adequately describes his philosophy is controversial.

Prominent among his claims to recognition is that he transplanted rhetoric from his native Sicily to Attica, and contributed to the diffusion of the Attic dialect as the language of literary prose.

==Life==
Gorgias was born in Leontinoi, a Chalcidian colony in eastern Sicily that was allied with Athens. His father&#x27;s name was Charmantides. He had a brother named Herodicus, who was a physician, and sometimes accompanied him during his travels. He also had a sister, whose name is not known, but whose grandson dedicated a golden statue to his great uncle at Delphi. It is not known whether Gorgias married or had children. Gorgias is said to have studied under the Sicilian philosopher Empedocles of Acragas ( 490 –  430 BC), but it is not known when, where, for how long, or in what capacity. He may have also studied under the rhetoricians Corax of Syracuse and Tisias, but very little is known about either of these men, nor is anything known about their relationship with Gorgias.

It is not known what kind of role Gorgias may have played in the politics in his native Leontinoi, but it is known that, in 427 BC, when he was around sixty years old, he was sent to Athens by his fellow-citizens as the head of an embassy to ask for Athenian protection against the aggression of the Syracusans. After 427 BC, Gorgias appears to have settled in mainland Greece, living at various points in a number of city-states, including Athens and Larisa. He was well known for delivering orations at Panhellenic Festivals and is described as having been &quot;conspicuous&quot; at Olympia. There is no surviving record of any role he might have played in organizing the festivals themselves.

Gorgias&#x27;s primary occupation was as a teacher of rhetoric. According to Aristotle, his students included Isocrates. (Other students are named in later traditions; the &quot;Suda&quot; adds Pericles, Polus, and Alcidamas, Diogenes Laërtius mentions Antisthenes, and according to Philostratus, &quot;I understand that he attracted the attention of the most admired men, Critias and Alcibiades who were young, and Thucydides and Pericles who were already old. Agathon too, the tragic poet, whom Comedy regards as wise and eloquent, often Gorgianizes in his iambic verse&quot;). Additionally, although they are not described as his students, Gorgias is widely thought to have influenced the styles of the historian Thucydides, the tragic playwright Agathon, the doctor Hippocrates, the rhetorician Alcidamas, and the poet and commentator Lycophron.

Gorgias is reputed to have lived to be one hundred and eight
years old (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). He won admiration for his ability to speak on any subject (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). He accumulated considerable wealth; enough to commission a gold statue of himself for a public temple. After his Pythian Oration, the Greeks installed a solid gold statue of him in the temple of Apollo at Delphi (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). He died at Larissa in Thessaly.

==Philosophy==
The philosophies of the pre-Socratic Greek Sophists are much debated among scholars in general, due to their highly subtle and ambiguous writings and also to the fact that they are best known as characters in Plato&#x27;s dialogues. Gorgias, however, is particularly frustrating for modern scholars to attempt to understand. While scholars debate the precise subtleties of the teachings of Protagoras, Hippias, and Prodicus, they generally agree on the basic frameworks of what these thinkers believed. With Gorgias, however, scholars widely disagree on even the most basic framework of his ideas, including over whether or not that framework even existed at all. The greatest hindrance to scholarly understanding of Gorgias&#x27;s philosophy is that the vast majority of his writings have been lost and those that have survived have suffered considerable alteration by later copyists.

These difficulties are further compounded by the fact that Gorgias&#x27;s rhetoric is frequently elusive and confusing; he makes many of his most important points using elaborate, but highly ambiguous, metaphors, similes, and puns. Many of Gorgias&#x27;s propositions are also thought to be sarcastic, playful, or satirical. In his treatise &quot;On Rhetoric&quot;, Aristotle characterizes Gorgias&#x27;s style of oratory as &quot;pervasively ironic&quot; and states that Gorgias recommended responding to seriousness with jests and to jests with seriousness. Gorgias frequently blurs the lines between serious philosophical discourse and satire, which makes it extremely difficult for scholars to tell when he is being serious and when he is merely joking. Gorgias frequently contradicts his own statements and adopts inconsistent perspectives on different issues. As a result of all these factors, Scott Porter Consigny calls him &quot;perhaps the most elusive of the polytropic quarry hunted in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Sophist&quot;.

Gorgias has been labelled &quot;The Nihilist&quot; because some scholars have interpreted his thesis on &quot;the non-existent&quot; to be an argument against the existence of anything that is straightforwardly endorsed by Gorgias himself. According to Alan Pratt, nihilism is &quot;the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated.&quot; It is associated with pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence.

Gorgias presented his nihilist arguments in &quot;On Non-Existence&quot;; however, the original text is no longer extant. We only know his arguments through commentary by Sextus Empiricus and Pseudo-Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;De Melisso, Xenophane, Gorgia.&quot; Ostensibly Gorgias developed three sequential arguments: first, that nothing exists; second, that even if existence exists, it is inapprehensible to humans; and third, that even if existence is apprehensible, it certainly cannot be communicated or interpreted to one&#x27;s neighbors.

That being said, there is consensus in late 20th century and early 21st century scholarship that the label &#x27;nihilist&#x27; is misleading, in part because if his argument were genuinely meant to support nihilism it would be self-undermining. The argument &quot;is&quot; itself something, and has pretensions to communicate knowledge, in conflict with its explicit pronouncement that there is nothing and that it can&#x27;t be known or communicated. Gisela Striker argues: &quot;I find it hard to believe that anyone should ever have thought that Gorgias seriously advocated the view that nothing is and that he was, therefore, a &#x27;nihilist.&#x27;&quot; Similarly Caston states: &quot;Gorgias would have to be not merely disconsolate, but quite dull-witted, to have missed the conflict between his presentation and its content&quot;. Finally, Wardy says, &quot;This sadly mistaken reading overlooks the most obvious consequence of Gorgias&#x27; &quot;paradoxologia&quot; (παραδοξολογία): his message refutes itself, and in consequence, so far from constituting a theory of &quot;logos&quot;, it confronts us with a picture of what language cannot be, with what it cannot be assumed to aspire to be.&quot; Gigon and Newiger make similar points.

==Rhetorical innovation==

Gorgias ushered in rhetorical innovations involving structure and ornamentation, and he introduced &quot;paradoxologia&quot; – the idea of paradoxical thought and paradoxical expression. For these advancements, Gorgias has been labeled the &quot;father of sophistry&quot; (Wardy 6). Gorgias is also known for contributing to the diffusion of the Attic Greek dialect as the language of literary prose. Gorgias was the first orator known to develop and teach a &quot;distinctive style of speaking&quot; (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33).

Gorgias&#x27; extant rhetorical works – &quot;Encomium of Helen&quot; (Ἑλένης ἐγκώμιον), &quot;Defense of Palamedes&quot; (Ὑπέρ Παλαμήδους ἀπολογία), &quot;On Non-Existence&quot; (Περὶ τοῦ μὴ ὄντος ἢ Περὶ φύσεως), and &quot;Epitaphios&quot; (Επιτάφιος) – come to us via a work entitled &quot;Technai&quot; (Τέχναι), a manual of rhetorical instruction, which may have consisted of models to be memorized and demonstrate various principles of rhetorical practice (Leitch, et al. 29). Although some scholars claim that each work presents opposing statements, the four texts can be read as interrelated contributions to the up-and-coming theory and art (&quot;technē&quot;) of rhetoric (McComiskey 32). Of Gorgias&#x27; surviving works, only the &quot;Encomium&quot; and the &quot;Defense&quot; are believed to exist in their entirety. Meanwhile, there are his own speeches, rhetorical, political, or other. A number of these are referred to and quoted by Aristotle, including a speech on Hellenic unity, a funeral oration for Athenians fallen in war, and a brief quotation from an &quot;Encomium on the Eleans.&quot; Apart from the speeches, there are paraphrases of the treatise &quot;On Nature or the Non-Existent.&quot; These works are each part of the Diels-Kranz collection, and although academics consider this source reliable, many of the works included are fragmentary and corrupt. Questions have also been raised as to the authenticity and accuracy of the texts attributed to Gorgias (Consigny 4).

Gorgias&#x27; writings are intended to be both rhetorical (persuasive) and performative. He goes to great lengths to exhibit his ability of making an absurd, argumentative position appear stronger. Consequently, each of his works defend positions that are unpopular, paradoxical and even absurd. The performative nature of Gorgias&#x27; writings is exemplified by the way that he playfully approaches each argument with stylistic devices such as parody, artificial figuration and theatricality (Consigny 149). Gorgias&#x27; style of argumentation can be described as poetics-minus-the-meter (&quot;poiêsis-minus-meter&quot;). Gorgias argues that persuasive words have power (&quot;dunamis&quot;) that is equivalent to that of the gods and as strong as physical force. In the &quot;Encomium&quot;, Gorgias likens the effect of speech on the soul to the effect of drugs on the body: &quot;Just as different drugs draw forth different humors from the body – some putting a stop to disease, others to life – so too with words: some cause pain, others joy, some strike fear, some stir the audience to boldness, some benumb and bewitch the soul with evil persuasion&quot; (Gorgias 32). The &quot;Encomium&quot; &quot;argues for the totalizing power of language.&quot;

Gorgias also believed that his &quot;magical incantations&quot; would bring healing to the human psyche by controlling powerful emotions. He paid particular attention to the sounds of words, which, like poetry, could captivate audiences. His florid, rhyming style seemed to hypnotize his audiences (Herrick 42).

Unlike other Sophists, such as Protagoras, Gorgias did not profess to teach &quot;arete&quot; (excellence, or, virtue). He believed that there was no absolute form of &quot;arete&quot;, but that it was relative to each situation. For example, virtue in a slave was not the same as virtue in a statesman. He believed that rhetoric, the art of persuasion, was the king of all sciences, since he saw it as a techné with which one could persuade an audience toward any course of action. While rhetoric existed in the curriculum of every Sophist, Gorgias placed more prominence upon it than any of the others.

Much debate over both the nature and value of rhetoric begins with Gorgias. Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Gorgias&quot; presents a counter-argument to Gorgias&#x27; embrace of rhetoric, its elegant form, and performative nature (Wardy 2). The dialogue tells the story of a debate about rhetoric, politics and justice that occurred at a dinner gathering between Socrates and a small group of Sophists. Plato attempts to show that rhetoric does not meet the requirements to actually be considered a &quot;technê&quot; but rather is a somewhat dangerous &quot;knack&quot; to possess, both for the orator and for his audience, because it gives the ignorant the power to seem more knowledgeable than an expert to a group.

==&quot;On Non-Existence&quot;==
Gorgias is the author of a lost work: &quot;On Nature or the Non-Existent&quot; (also &quot;On Non-Existence&quot;). Rather than being one of his rhetorical works, it presented a theory of being that at the same time refuted and parodied the Eleatic thesis. The original text was lost and today there remain just two paraphrases of it. The first is preserved by the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus in &quot;Against the Logicians&quot; and the other by Pseudo-Aristotle, the author of &quot;On Melissus, Xenophanes, and Gorgias&quot;. Each work, however, excludes material that is discussed in the other, which suggests that each version may represent intermediary sources (Consigny 4). It is clear, however, that the work developed a skeptical argument, which has been extracted from the sources and translated as below:
# Nothing exists;
# Even if something exists, nothing can be known about it; and
# Even if something can be known about it, knowledge about it can&#x27;t be communicated to others.
# Even if it can be communicated, it cannot be understood.

The argument has largely been seen as an ironic refutation of Parmenides&#x27; thesis on Being. Gorgias set out to prove that it is as easy to demonstrate that being is one, unchanging and timeless as it is to prove that being has no existence at all. Regardless of how it &quot;has largely been seen&quot; it seems clear that Gorgias was focused instead on the notion that true objectivity is impossible since the human mind can never be separated from its possessor.

&quot;How can anyone communicate the idea of color by means of words since the ear does not hear colors but only sounds?&quot; This quote was used to show his theory that &#x27;there is nothing&#x27;, &#x27;if there were anything no one would know it&#x27;, &#x27;and if anyone did know it, no one could communicate it&#x27;. This theory, thought of in the late 5th century BC, is still being contemplated by many philosophers throughout the world. This argument has led some to label Gorgias a nihilist (one who believes nothing exists, or that the world is incomprehensible, and that the concept of truth is fictitious).

For the first main argument where Gorgias says, &quot;there is no-thing&quot;, he tries to persuade the reader that thought and existence are not the same. By claiming that if thought and existence truly were the same, then everything that anyone thought would suddenly exist. He also attempted to prove that words and sensations could not be measured by the same standards, for even though words and sensations are both derived from the mind, they are essentially different. This is where his second idea comes into place.

==Rhetorical works==

===&quot;Encomium of Helen&quot;===
The &quot;Encomium of Helen&quot; is considered to be a good example of epideictic oratory and was supposed to have been Gorgias&#x27; &quot;show piece or demonstration piece,&quot; which was used to attract students (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). In their writings, Gorgias and other sophists speculated &quot;about the structure and function of language&quot; as a framework for expressing the implications of action and the ways decisions about such actions were made&quot; (Jarratt 103). And this is exactly the purpose of Gorgias&#x27; &quot;Encomium of Helen&quot;. Of the three divisions of rhetoric discussed by Aristotle in his &quot;Rhetoric&quot; (forensic, deliberative, and epideictic), the &quot;Encomium&quot; can be classified as an epideictic speech, expressing praise for Helen of Troy and ridding her of the blame she faced for leaving Sparta with Paris (Wardy 26).

Helen – the proverbial &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; – exemplified both sexual passion and tremendous beauty for the Greeks. She was the daughter of Zeus and Leda, the Queen of Sparta, and her beauty was seen by the Trojans as the direct cause of the decade long Trojan War between Greece and Troy. The war began after the goddesses Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite asked Paris (a Trojan prince) to select who was the most beautiful of the three. Each goddess tried to influence Paris&#x27; decision, but he ultimately chose Aphrodite who then promised Paris the most beautiful woman. Paris then traveled to Greece where he was greeted by Helen and her husband Menelaus. Under the influence of Aphrodite, Helen allowed Paris to persuade her to elope with him. Together they traveled to Troy, not only sparking the war, but also a popular and literary tradition of blaming Helen for her wrongdoing. It is this tradition which Gorgias confronts in the &quot;Encomium&quot;.

The &quot;Encomium&quot; opens with Gorgias explaining that &quot;a man, woman, speech, deed, city or action that is worthy of praise should be honored with acclaim, but the unworthy should be branded with blame&quot; (Gorgias 30). In the speech Gorgias discusses the possible reasons for Helen&#x27;s journey to Troy. He explains that Helen could have been persuaded in one of four ways: by the gods, by physical force, by love, or by speech (&quot;logos&quot;). If it were indeed the plan of the gods that caused Helen to depart for Troy, Gorgias argues that those who blame her should face blame themselves, &quot;for a human&#x27;s anticipation cannot restrain a god&#x27;s inclination&quot; (Gorgias 31). Gorgias explains that, by nature, the weak are ruled by the strong, and, since the gods are stronger than humans in all respects, Helen should be freed from her undesirable reputation. If, however, Helen was abducted by force, it is clear that the aggressor committed a crime. Thus, it should be he, not Helen, who should be blamed. And if Helen was persuaded by love, she should also be rid of ill repute because &quot;if love is a god, with the divine power of the gods, how could a weaker person refuse and reject him? But if love is a human sickness and a mental weakness, it must not be blamed as mistake, but claimed as misfortune&quot; (Gorgias 32). Finally, if speech persuaded Helen, Gorgias claims he can easily clear her of blame. Gorgias explains: &quot;Speech is a powerful master and achieves the most divine feats with the smallest and least evident body. It can stop fear, relieve pain, create joy, and increase pity&quot; (Gorgias 31). It is here that Gorgias compares the effect of speech on the mind with the effect of drugs on the body. He states that Helen has the power to &quot;lead&quot; many bodies in competition by using her body as a weapon (Gumpert, 74). This image of &quot;bodies led and misled, brought together and led apart, is of paramount importance in Gorgias&#x27; speech,&quot; (Gumpert, 74).

While Gorgias primarily used metaphors and paradox, he famously used &quot;figures of speech, or schemata&quot; (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa). This included balanced clauses (isocolon), the joining of contrasting ideas (antithesis), the structure of successive clauses (parison), and the repetition of word endings (homoeoteleuton) (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). The &quot;Encomium&quot; shows Gorgias&#x27; interest in argumentation, as he makes his point by &quot;systematically refuting a series of possible alternatives,&quot; (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). It is an encomium of the &quot;rhetorical craft itself, and a demonstration of its power over us,&quot; (Gumpert, 73). According to Van Hook, &quot;The Encomium of Helen&quot; abounds in &quot;amplification and brevity, a rhythm making prose akin to poetry, bold metaphors and poetic or unusual epithets&quot; (122).

===&quot;Defense of Palamedes&quot;===
In the &quot;Defense of Palamedes&quot; Gorgias describes logos as a positive instrument for creating ethical arguments (McComiskey 38). The &quot;Defense&quot;, an oration that deals with issues of morality and political commitment (Consigny 38), defends Palamedes who, in Greek mythology, is credited with the invention of the alphabet, written laws, numbers, armor, and measures and weights (McComiskey 47).

In the speech Palamedes defends himself against the charge of treason. In Greek mythology, Odysseus – in order to avoid going to Troy with Agamemnon and Menelaus to bring Helen back to Sparta – pretended to have gone mad and began sowing the fields with salt. When Palamedes threw Odysseus&#x27; son, Telemachus, in front of the plow, Odysseus avoided him, demonstrating that he was sane. Odysseus, who never forgave Palamedes for making him reveal himself, later accused Palamedes of betraying the Greeks to the Trojans. Soon after, Palamedes was condemned and killed (Jarratt 58).

In this epideictic speech, like the &quot;Encomium&quot;, Gorgias is concerned with experimenting with how plausible arguments can cause conventional truths to be doubted (Jarratt 59). Throughout the text, Gorgias presents a method for composing logical (&quot;logos&quot;), ethical (&quot;ethos&quot;) and emotional (&quot;pathos&quot;) arguments from possibility, which are similar to those described by Aristotle in &quot;Rhetoric&quot;. These types of arguments about motive and capability presented in the &quot;Defense&quot; are later described by Aristotle as forensic &quot;topoi&quot;. Gorgias demonstrates that in order to prove that treason had been committed, a set of possible occurrences also need to be established. In the &quot;Defense&quot; these occurrences are as follows: communication between Palamedes and the enemy, exchange of a pledge in the form of hostages or money, and not being detected by guards or citizens. In his defense, Palamedes claims that a small sum of money would not have warranted such a large undertaking and reasons that a large sum of money, if indeed such a transaction had been made, would require the aid of many confederates in order for it to be transported. Palamedes reasons further that such an exchange could neither have occurred at night because the guards would be watching, nor in the day because everyone would be able to see. Palamedes continues, explaining that if the aforementioned conditions were, in fact, arranged then action would need to follow. Such action needed to take place either with or without confederates; however, if these confederates were free men then they were free to disclose any information they desired, but if they were slaves there was a risk of their voluntarily accusing to earn freedom, or accusing by force when tortured. Slaves, Palamedes says, are untrustworthy. Palamedes goes on to list a variety of possible motives, all of which he proves false.

Through the &quot;Defense&quot; Gorgias demonstrates that a motive requires an advantage such as status, wealth, honour, and security, and insists that Palamedes lacked a motive (McComiskey 47–49).

===&quot;Epitaphios&quot; (or the Athenian funeral oration)===
This text is considered to be an important contribution to the genre of epitaphios. During the 5th and 4th centuries BC, such funeral orations were delivered by well-known orators during public burial ceremonies in Athens, whereby those who died in wars were honoured. Gorgias&#x27; text provides a clever critique of 5th century propagandist rhetoric in imperial Athens and is the basis for Plato&#x27;s parody, &quot;Menexenus&quot; (Consigny 2).

==Reception and legacy==
===In antiquity===
Plato was one of Gorgias&#x27; greatest critics and a student of Socrates. Plato&#x27;s dislike for sophistic doctrines is well known, and it is in his eponymous dialogue that both Gorgias himself as well as his rhetorical beliefs are ridiculed (McComiskey 17).

In his dialogue &quot;Gorgias&quot;, Plato distinguishes between philosophy and rhetoric, characterizing Gorgias as a shallow, opportunistic orator who entertains his audience with his eloquent words and who believes that it is unnecessary to learn the truth about actual matters when one has discovered the art of persuasion. In the dialogue, Gorgias responds to one of Socrates&#x27; statements as follows: &quot;Rhetoric is the only area of expertise you need to learn. You can ignore all the rest and still get the better of the professionals!&quot; (Plato 24).

Gorgias, whose &quot;On Non-Existence&quot; is taken to be critical of the Eleatic tradition and its founder Parmenides, describes philosophy as a type of seduction, but he does not deny philosophy entirely, giving some respect to philosophers.

Plato answers Gorgias by reaffirming the Parmenidean ideal that being is the basic substance and reality of which all things are composed, insisting that philosophy is a dialectic distinct from and superior to rhetoric (Wardy 52).

Aristotle also criticizes Gorgias, labeling him a mere Sophist whose primary goal is to make money by appearing wise and clever, thus deceiving the public by means of misleading or sophistic arguments.

Despite these negative portrayals, Gorgias&#x27;s style of rhetoric was highly influential. Gorgias&#x27;s &quot;Defense of Helen&quot; influenced Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Helen&quot; and his &quot;Defense of Palamedes&quot; influenced the development of western dicanic argument, including possibly even Plato&#x27;s version of the &quot;Apology of Socrates&quot;.

===Modern reception===
For almost all of western history, Gorgias has been a marginalized and obscure figure in both philosophical thought and culture at large. In the nineteenth century, however, writers such as the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) and the English classicist George Grote (1794–1871) began to work to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; Gorgias and the other Sophists from their longstanding reputation as unscrupulous charlatans who taught people how to persuade others using rhetoric for unjust causes. As early as 1872, the English philosopher Henry Sidgwick (1838–1900) was already calling this the &quot;old view&quot;. Modern sources continue to affirm that the old stereotype of the Sophists is not accurate.

Since the late twentieth century, scholarly interest in Gorgias has increased dramatically and the amount of research conducted on him is even beginning to rival the research on his more traditionally popular contemporary Parmenides. Gorgias&#x27;s distinctive writing style, filled with antithesis and figurative language, has been seen as foreshadowing the later development of Menippean satire, as well as, in more recent times, the mannerist, grotesque, and carnivalesque genres. Several scholars have even argued that Gorgias&#x27;s thoughts on the nature of knowledge, language, and truth foreshadow the views of modern philosophers such as Martin Heidegger, Jacques Derrida, Ludwig Wittgenstein, A. J. Ayer, Amélie Rorty, and Stanley Fish. Nonetheless, many academic philosophers still ridicule any efforts to portray Gorgias as a serious thinker.

<text>Mnevis (, ) is the Hellenized name of an ancient Egyptian bull god which had its centre of worship at Heliopolis, and was known to the ancient Egyptians as Mer-wer or Nem-wer.

Although initially a separate god, it was later assimilated to the syncretized god Atum-Ra as his physical manifestation, and also considered as the ba of Ra. Mnevis is often depicted as a black bull wearing a solar disk and uraeus. As reported by Plutarch, the Mnevis bull was second only to the Memphite Apis bull in importance. Similarly to the Apis bull, the Mnevis bull&#x27;s movements were thought to be driven by divine will, and used as an oracle. The priesthood of Mnevis also went as far as to claim that Mnevis was none other than the father of the more famous Apis.

The Mnevis bull was entitled to two concubines, more precisely two cows representing Hathor and Iusaaset. When the bull died, he was embalmed and buried with all honours in a dedicated necropolis which was located not far from the temple at Heliopolis. Another burial ground was reserved for the so-called Mothers of Mnevis, which were considered the embodiment of the cow-goddess Hesat. After a Mnevis bull&#x27;s death a replacement for him was sought, usually a completely black bull. There was only ever one Mnevis bull at a time.

The cult of Mnevis was among the very few to be tolerated during the &quot;Amarna heresy&quot; of King Akhenaten, probably because of its solar attributes. It is known that Akhenaten ordered the construction of a necropolis for Mnevis bulls in Akhetaten, although it has not yet been found.

<text>Anarcho-primitivism, also known as anti-civilization anarchism, is an anarchist critique of civilization that advocates a return to non-civilized ways of life through deindustrialization, abolition of the division of labor or specialization, abandonment of large-scale organization and all technology other than prehistoric technology, and the dissolution of agriculture. Anarcho-primitivists critique the origins and alleged progress of the Industrial Revolution and industrial society. Most anarcho-primitivists advocate for a tribal-like way of life while some see an even simpler lifestyle as beneficial. According to anarcho-primitivists, the shift from hunter-gatherer to agricultural subsistence during the Neolithic Revolution gave rise to coercion, social alienation, and social stratification.

Anarcho-primitivism argues that civilization is at the root of societal and environmental problems. Primitivists also consider domestication, technology and language to cause social alienation from &quot;authentic reality&quot;. As a result, they propose the abolition of civilization and a return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

==History==
===Roots===
The roots of primitivism lay in Enlightenment philosophy and the critical theory of the Frankfurt School. The early-modern philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau blamed agriculture and cooperation for the development of social inequality and causing habitat destruction. In his &quot;Discourse on Inequality&quot;, Rousseau depicted the state of nature as a &quot;primitivist utopia&quot;; however, he stopped short of advocating a return to it. Instead, he called for political institutions to be recreated anew, in harmony with nature and without the artificiality of modern civilization. Later, critical theorist Max Horkheimer argued that Environmental degradation stemmed directly from social oppression, which had vested all value in labor and consequently caused widespread alienation.

===Development===

The modern school of anarcho-primitivism was primarily developed by John Zerzan, whose work was released at a time when green anarchist theories of social and deep ecology were beginning to attract interest. Primitivism, as outlined in Zerzan&#x27;s work, first gained popularity as enthusiasm in deep ecology began to wane.

Zerzan claimed that pre-civilization societies were inherently superior to modern civilization and that the move towards agriculture and the increasing use of technology had resulted in the alienation and oppression of humankind. Zerzan argued that under civilization, humans and other species have undergone domestication, which stripped them of their agency and subjected them to control by capitalism. He also claimed that language, mathematics and art had caused alienation, as they replaced &quot;authentic reality&quot; with an abstracted representation of reality. In order to counteract such issues, Zerzan proposed that humanity return to a state of nature, which he believed would increase social equality and individual autonomy by abolishing private property, organized violence and the division of labour.

Primitivist thinker Paul Shepard also criticized domestication, which he believed had devalued non-human life and reduced human life to their labor and property. Other primitivist authors have drawn different conclusions to Zerzan on the origins of alienation, with John Fillis blaming technology and Richard Heinberg claiming it to be a result of addiction psychology.

===Adoption and practice===
Primitivist ideas were taken up by the eco-terrorist Ted Kaczynski, although he has been repeatedly criticised for his violent means by more pacifistic anarcho-primitivists, who instead advocate for non-violent forms of direct action. Primitivist concepts have also taken root within the philosophy of deep ecology, inspiring the direct actions of groups such as Earth First!. Another radical environmentalist group, the Earth Liberation Front (ELF), was directly influenced by anarcho-primitivism and its calls for rewilding.

Primitivists and green anarchists have adopted the concept of ecological rewilding as part of their practice, i.e., using reclaimed skills and methods to work towards a sustainable future while undoing institutions of civilization.

Anarcho-primitivist periodicals include &quot;Green Anarchy&quot; and &quot;Species Traitor&quot;. The former, self-described as an &quot;anti-civilization journal of theory and action&quot; and printed in Eugene, Oregon, was first published in 2000 and expanded from a 16-page newsprint tabloid to a 76-page magazine covering monkeywrenching topics such as pipeline sabotage and animal liberation. &quot;Species Traitor&quot;, edited by Kevin Tucker, is self-described as &quot;an insurrectionary anarcho-primitivist journal&quot;, with essays against literacy and for hunter gatherer societies. Adjacent periodicals include the radical environmental journal &quot;Earth First!&quot;

== Criticisms ==

A common criticism is of hypocrisy, i.e. that people rejecting civilization typically maintain a civilized lifestyle themselves, often while still using the very industrial technology that they oppose in order to spread their message. Activist writer Derrick Jensen counters that this criticism merely resorts to an &quot;ad hominem&quot; argument, attacking individuals but not the actual validity of their beliefs. He further responds that working to entirely avoid such hypocrisy is ineffective, self-serving, and a convenient misdirection of activist energies. Primitivist John Zerzan admits that living with this hypocrisy is a necessary evil for continuing to contribute to the larger intellectual conversation.

Wolfi Landstreicher and Jason McQuinn, post-leftists, have both criticized the romanticized exaggerations of indigenous societies and the pseudoscientific (and even mystical) appeal to nature they perceive in anarcho-primitivist ideology and deep ecology. 

Ted Kaczynski also argued that anarcho-primitivists have exaggerated the short working week of primitive society, arguing that they only examine the process of food extraction and not the processing of food, creation of fire and childcare, which adds up to over 40 hours a week.

<text>Theophrastus (; ; c. 371 – c. 287 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher and naturalist. A native of Eresos in Lesbos, he was Aristotle&#x27;s close colleague and successor as head of the Lyceum, the Peripatetic school of philosophy in Athens. Theophrastus wrote numerous treatises across all areas of philosophy, working to support, improve, expand, and develop the Aristotelian system. He made significant contributions to various fields, including ethics, metaphysics, botany, and natural history. Often considered the &quot;father of botany&quot; for his groundbreaking works &quot;Enquiry into Plants&quot; () and &quot;On the Causes of Plants,&quot; () Theophrastus established the foundations of botanical science. His given name was (Ancient Greek: ); the nickname Theophrastus (&quot;divine speaker&quot;) was reputedly given to him by Aristotle in recognition of his eloquent style.

He came to Athens at a young age and initially studied in Plato&#x27;s school. After Plato&#x27;s death, he attached himself to Aristotle who took to Theophrastus in his writings. When Aristotle fled Athens, Theophrastus took over as head of the Lyceum. Theophrastus presided over the Peripatetic school for thirty-six years, during which time the school flourished greatly. He is often considered the father of botany for his works on plants. After his death, the Athenians honoured him with a public funeral. His successor as head of the school was Strato of Lampsacus.

The interests of Theophrastus were wide ranging, including biology, physics, ethics and metaphysics. His two surviving botanical works, &quot;Enquiry into Plants (Historia Plantarum)&quot; and &quot;On the Causes of Plants&quot;, were an important influence on Renaissance science. There are also surviving works &quot;On Moral Characters&quot;, &quot;On Sense Perception&quot;, and &quot;On Stones&quot;, as well as fragments on &quot;Physics&quot; and &quot;Metaphysics&quot;. In philosophy, he studied grammar and language and continued Aristotle&#x27;s work on logic. He also regarded space as the mere arrangement and position of bodies, time as an accident of motion, and motion as a necessary consequence of all activity. In ethics, he regarded happiness as depending on external influences as well as on virtue.

== Life ==
Most of the biographical information about Theophrastus was provided by Diogenes Laërtius&#x27; &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;, written more than four hundred years after Theophrastus&#x27;s time. He was a native of Eresos in Lesbos. His given name was Tyrtamus (), but he later became known by the nickname &quot;Theophrastus&quot;, given to him, it is said, by Aristotle to indicate the grace of his conversation (from Ancient Greek &#x27;god&#x27; and &#x27;to phrase&#x27;, i.e. divine expression).

After receiving instruction in philosophy on Lesbos from one Alcippus, he moved to Athens, where he may have studied under Plato. He became friends with Aristotle, and when Plato died (348/7 BC) Theophrastus may have joined Aristotle in his self-imposed exile from Athens. When Aristotle moved to Mytilene on Lesbos in 345/4, it is very likely that he did so at the urging of Theophrastus. It seems that it was on Lesbos that Aristotle and Theophrastus began their research into natural science, with Aristotle studying animals and Theophrastus studying plants. Theophrastus probably accompanied Aristotle to Macedonia when Aristotle was appointed tutor to Alexander the Great in 343/2. Around 335 BC, Theophrastus moved with Aristotle to Athens, where Aristotle began teaching in the Lyceum. When, after the death of Alexander, anti-Macedonian feeling forced Aristotle to leave Athens, Theophrastus remained behind as head (&quot;scholarch&quot;) of the Peripatetic school, a position he continued to hold after Aristotle&#x27;s death in 322/1.

Aristotle in his will made him guardian of his children, including Nicomachus, with whom he was close. Aristotle likewise bequeathed to him his library and the originals of his works, and designated him as his successor at the Lyceum. Eudemus of Rhodes also had some claims to this position, and Aristoxenus is said to have resented Aristotle&#x27;s choice.

Theophrastus presided over the Peripatetic school for 35 years, and died at age 85, according to Diogenes.
He is said to have remarked, &quot;We die just when we are beginning to live&quot;.

Under his guidance, the school flourished greatly—there were at one period more than 2,000 students, Diogenes affirms—and at his death, according to the terms of his will preserved by Diogenes, he bequeathed to it his garden with house and colonnades as a permanent seat of instruction. The comic poet Menander was among his pupils. His popularity was shown in the regard paid to him by Philip, Cassander, and Ptolemy, and by the complete failure of a charge of impiety brought against him. He was honored with a public funeral, and &quot;the whole population of Athens, honouring him greatly, followed him to the grave.&quot; He was succeeded as head of the Lyceum by Strato of Lampsacus.

== Writings ==

From the lists of Diogenes, giving 227 titles, it appears that the activity of Theophrastus extended over the whole field of contemporary knowledge. His writing probably differed little from Aristotle&#x27;s treatment of the same themes, though supplementary in details. Like Aristotle, most of his writings are lost works. Thus Theophrastus, like Aristotle, had composed a first and second &quot;Analytic&quot; ( and ). He had also written books on &quot;Topics&quot; (, and ); on the &quot;Analysis of Syllogisms&quot; ( and ), on &quot;Sophisms&quot; () and on &quot;Affirmation and Denial&quot; () as well as on the &quot;Natural Philosophy&quot; (, , and others), on &quot;Heaven&quot; (), and on &quot;Meteorological Phenomena&quot; ( and ).

In addition, Theophrastus wrote on the &quot;Warm and the Cold&quot; (), on &quot;Water&quot; (), &quot;Fire&quot; (), the &quot;Sea&quot; (), on &quot;Coagulation and Melting&quot; (), on various phenomena of organic and spiritual life, and on the &quot;Soul&quot; (), on &quot;Experience&quot; () and &quot;On Sense Perception&quot; (also known as &quot;On the Senses&quot;; ). Likewise, we find mention of monographs of Theophrastus on the early Greek philosophers Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Archelaus, Diogenes of Apollonia, Democritus, which were made use of by Simplicius; and also on Xenocrates, against the Academics, and a sketch of the political doctrine of Plato.

He studied general history, as we know from Plutarch&#x27;s lives of Lycurgus, Solon, Aristides, Pericles, Nicias, Alcibiades, Lysander, Agesilaus, and Demosthenes, which were probably borrowed from the work on &quot;Lives&quot; (). But his main efforts were to continue the labours of Aristotle in natural history. This is testified to not only by a number of treatises on individual subjects of zoology, of which, besides the titles, only fragments remain, but also by his books &quot;On Stones&quot;, his &quot;Enquiry into Plants&quot;, and &quot;On the Causes of Plants&quot; (see below), which have come down to us entire. In politics, also, he seems to have trodden in the footsteps of Aristotle. Besides his books on the &quot;State&quot; ( and ), we find quoted various treatises on &quot;Education&quot; ( and ), on &quot;Royalty&quot; (, and ), on the &quot;Best State&quot; (), on &quot;Political Morals&quot; (), and particularly his works on the &quot;Laws&quot; (, and ), one of which, containing a recapitulation of the laws of various barbarian as well as Greek states, was intended to be a companion to Aristotle&#x27;s outline of &quot;Politics&quot;, and must have been similar to it. He also wrote on oratory and poetry. Theophrastus, without doubt, departed further from Aristotle in his ethical writings, as also in his metaphysical investigations of motion, the soul, and God.

Besides these writings, Theophrastus wrote several collections of problems, out of which some things at least have passed into the &quot;Problems&quot; that have come down to us under the name of Aristotle, and commentaries, partly dialogue, to which probably belonged the &quot;Erotikos&quot; (), &quot;Megacles&quot; (), &quot;Callisthenes&quot; (), and &quot;Megarikos&quot; (), and letters, partly books on mathematical sciences and their history.

Many of his surviving works exist only in fragmentary form. &quot;The style of these works, as of the botanical books, suggests that, as in the case of Aristotle, what we possess consists of notes for lectures or notes taken of lectures,&quot; his translator Arthur F. Hort remarks. &quot;There is no literary charm; the sentences are mostly compressed and highly elliptical, to the point sometimes of obscurity&quot;. The text of these fragments and extracts is often so corrupt that there is a certain plausibility to the well-known story that the works of Aristotle and Theophrastus were allowed to languish in the cellar of Neleus of Scepsis and his descendants.

=== On plants ===
The most important of his books are two large botanical treatises, &quot;Enquiry into Plants&quot; (, generally known as ), and &quot;On the Causes of Plants&quot; (Greek: , Latin: ), which constitute the most important contribution to botanical science during antiquity and the Middle Ages, the first systemization of the botanical world; on the strength of these works some, following Linnaeus, call him the &quot;father of botany&quot;.

The &quot;Enquiry into Plants&quot; was originally ten books, of which nine survive. The work is arranged into a system whereby plants are classified according to their modes of generation, their localities, their sizes, and according to their practical uses such as foods, juices, herbs, etc. The first book deals with the parts of plants; the second book with the reproduction of plants and the times and manner of sowing; the third, fourth, and fifth books are devoted to trees, their types, their locations, and their practical applications; the sixth book deals with shrubs and spiny plants; the seventh book deals with herbs; the eighth book deals with plants that produce edible seeds; and the ninth book deals with plants that produce useful juices, gums, resins, etc.

&quot;On the Causes of Plants&quot; was originally eight books, of which six survive. It concerns the growth of plants; the influences on their fecundity; the proper times they should be sown and reaped; the methods of preparing the soil, manuring it, and the use of tools; and of the smells, tastes, and properties of many types of plants. The work deals mainly with the economical uses of plants rather than their medicinal uses, although the latter is sometimes mentioned. A book on wines and a book on plant smells may have once been part of the complete work.

Although these works contain many absurd and fabulous statements, they include valuable observations concerning the functions and properties of plants. Theophrastus observed the process of germination and recognized the significance of climate to plants. Much of the information on the Greek plants may have come from his own observations, as he is known to have travelled throughout Greece, and to have had a botanical garden of his own; but the works also profit from the reports on plants of Asia brought back from those who followed Alexander the Great: 

Theophrastus&#x27;s &quot;Enquiry into Plants&quot; was first published in a Latin translation by Theodore Gaza, at Treviso, 1483; in its original Greek it first appeared from the press of Aldus Manutius at Venice, 1495–98, from a third-rate manuscript, which, like the majority of the manuscripts that were sent to printers&#x27; workshops in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, has disappeared. Christian Wimmer identified two manuscripts of first quality, the &quot;Codex Urbinas&quot; in the Vatican Library, which was not made known to J. G. Schneider, who made the first modern critical edition, 1818–21, and the excerpts in the &quot;Codex Parisiensis&quot; in the Bibliothèque nationale de France.

=== On moral characters ===
His book &quot;Characters&quot; () contains thirty brief outlines of moral types. They are the first recorded attempt at systematic character writing. The book has been regarded by some as an independent work; others incline to the view that the sketches were written from time to time by Theophrastus, and collected and edited after his death; others, again, regard the &quot;Characters&quot; as part of a larger systematic work, but the style of the book is against this. Theophrastus has found many imitators in this kind of writing, notably Joseph Hall (1608), Sir Thomas Overbury (1614–16), Bishop Earle (1628), and Jean de La Bruyère (1688), who also translated the &quot;Characters&quot;. George Eliot also took inspiration from Theophrastus&#x27;s &quot;Characters&quot;, most notably in her book of caricatures, &quot;Impressions of Theophrastus Such&quot;. Writing the &quot;character sketch&quot; as a scholastic exercise also originated in Theophrastus&#x27;s typology.

=== On sensation ===
A treatise &quot;On Sense Perception&quot; () and its objects is important for a knowledge of the doctrines of the more ancient Greek philosophers regarding the subject. A paraphrase and commentary on this work was written by Priscian of Lydia in the sixth century. With this type of work we may connect the fragments on &quot;Smells&quot;, on &quot;Fatigue&quot;, on &quot;Dizziness&quot;, on &quot;Sweat&quot;, on &quot;Swooning&quot;, on &quot;Palsy&quot;, and on &quot;Honey&quot;.

=== Physics ===
Fragments of a &quot;History of Physics&quot; () are extant. To this class of work belong the still extant sections on &quot;Fire&quot;, on the &quot;Winds&quot;, and on the signs of &quot;Waters&quot;, &quot;Winds&quot;, and &quot;Storms&quot;.

Various smaller scientific fragments have been collected in the editions of Johann Gottlob Schneider (1818–21) and Friedrich Wimmer (1842–62) and in Hermann Usener&#x27;s &quot;Analecta Theophrastea&quot;.

=== Metaphysics ===
The &quot;Metaphysics&quot; (anachronistic Greek title: ), in nine chapters (also known as &quot;On First Principles&quot;), was considered a fragment of a larger work by Usener in his edition (Theophrastos, &quot;Metaphysica&quot;, Bonn, 1890), but according to Ross and Fobes in their edition (Theophrastus, &quot;Metaphysica&quot;, Oxford, 1929), the treatise is complete (p. X) and this opinion is now widely accepted. There is no reason for assigning this work to some other author because it is not noticed in Hermippus and Andronicus, especially as Nicolaus of Damascus had already mentioned it.

=== On stones ===
In his treatise &quot;On Stones&quot; (), which would become a source for other lapidaries until at least the Renaissance, Theophrastus classified rocks and gems based on their behavior when heated, further grouping minerals by common properties, such as amber and magnetite, which both have the power of attraction.

Theophrastus describes different marbles; mentions coal, which he says is used for heating by metal-workers; describes the various metal ores; and knew that pumice stones had a volcanic origin. He also deals with precious stones, emeralds, amethysts, onyx, jasper, etc., and describes a variety of &quot;sapphire&quot; that was blue with veins of gold, and thus was presumably lapis lazuli.

He knew that pearls came from shellfish, that coral came from India, and speaks of the fossilized remains of organic life. He also considers the practical uses of various stones, such as the minerals necessary for the manufacture of glass; for the production of various pigments of paint such as ochre; and for the manufacture of plaster.

Many of the rarer minerals were found in mines, and Theophrastus mentions the famous copper mines of Cyprus and the even more famous silver mines, presumably of Laurium near Athens – the basis of the wealth of the city – as well as referring to gold mines. The Laurium silver mines, which were the property of the state, were usually leased for a fixed sum and a percentage on the working. Towards the end of the fifth century BCE the output fell, partly owing to the Spartan occupation of Decelea from BCE. But the mines continued to be worked, though Strabo ( BCE to CE) records that in his time the tailings were being worked over, and Pausanias ( to ) speaks of the mines as a thing of the past. The ancient workings, consisting of shafts and galleries for excavating the ore, and washing tables for extracting the metal, may still be seen. Theophrastus wrote a separate work &quot;On Mining&quot;, which – like most of his writings – is a lost work.

Pliny the Elder makes clear references to his use of &quot;On Stones&quot; in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; of 77 AD, while updating and making much new information available on minerals himself. Although Pliny&#x27;s treatment of the subject is more extensive, Theophrastus is more systematic and his work is comparatively free from fable and magic, although he did describe lyngurium, a gemstone supposedly formed of the solidified urine of the lynx (the best ones coming from wild males), which featured in many lapidaries until it gradually disappeared from view in the 17th century.
It is mistakenly attributed to Theophrastus the first record of pyroelectricity. The misconception arose soon after the discovery of the pyroelectric properties of tourmaline, which made mineralogists of the time associate the &quot;lyngurium&quot; with it. Lyngurium is described in the work of Theophrastus as being similar to amber, capable of attracting &quot;straws and bits of wood&quot;, but without specifying any pyroelectric properties.

== Philosophy ==

The extent to which Theophrastus followed Aristotle&#x27;s doctrines, or defined them more accurately, or conceived them in a different form, and what additional structures of thought he placed upon them, can only be partially determined because of the loss of so many of his writings. Many of his opinions have to be reconstructed from the works of later writers such as Alexander of Aphrodisias and Simplicius.

=== Logic ===
Theophrastus seems to have carried out still further the grammatical foundation of logic and rhetoric, since in his book on the elements of speech, he distinguished the main parts of speech from the subordinate parts, and also direct expressions ( ) from metaphorical expressions, and dealt with the emotions ( ) of speech. He further distinguished a twofold reference of speech ( ) to things ( ) and to the hearers, and referred poetry and rhetoric to the latter.

He wrote at length on the unity of judgment, on the different kinds of negation, and on the difference between unconditional and conditional necessity. In his doctrine of syllogisms he brought forward the proof for the conversion of universal affirmative judgments, differed from Aristotle here and there in the laying down and arranging the &quot;modi&quot; of the syllogisms, partly in the proof of them, partly in the doctrine of mixture, i.e. of the influence of the modality of the premises upon the modality of the conclusion. Then, in two separate works, he dealt with the reduction of arguments to the syllogistic form and on the resolution of them; and further, with hypothetical conclusions. For the doctrine of proof, Galen quotes the second &quot;Analytic&quot; of Theophrastus, in conjunction with that of Aristotle, as the best treatises on that doctrine. In different monographs he seems to have tried to expand it into a general theory of science. To this, too, may have belonged the proposition quoted from his &quot;Topics&quot;, that the &quot;principles of opposites&quot; are themselves opposed, and cannot be deduced from one and the same higher genus. For the rest, some minor deviations from the Aristotelian definitions are quoted from the &quot;Topica&quot; of Theophrastus. Closely connected with this treatise was that upon ambiguous words or ideas, which, without doubt, corresponded to book Ε of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics&quot;.

=== Physics and metaphysics ===
Theophrastus introduced his Physics with the proof that all natural existence, being corporeal and composite, requires &quot;principles&quot;, and first and foremost, motion, as the basis of all change. Denying the substance of space, he seems to have regarded it, in opposition to Aristotle, as the mere arrangement and position ( and ) of bodies. Time he called an accident of motion, without, it seems, viewing it, with Aristotle, as the numerical determinant of motion. He attacked the doctrine of the four classical elements and challenged whether fire could be called a primary element when it appears to be compound, requiring, as it does, another material for its own nutriment.
He departed more widely from Aristotle in his doctrine of motion, since on the one hand he extended it over all categories, and did not limit it to those laid down by Aristotle. He viewed motion, with Aristotle, as an activity, not carrying its own goal in itself (), of that which only potentially exists, but he opposed Aristotle&#x27;s view that motion required a special explanation, and he regarded it as something proper both to nature in general and the celestial system in particular:

He recognised no activity without motion, and so referred all activities of the soul to motion: the desires and emotions to corporeal motion, judgment () and contemplation to spiritual motion. The idea of a spirit entirely independent of organic activity, must therefore have appeared to him very doubtful; yet he appears to have contented himself with developing his doubts and difficulties on the point, without positively rejecting it. Other Peripatetics, like Dicaearchus, Aristoxenus, and especially Strato, developed further this naturalism in Aristotelian doctrine.

Theophrastus seems, generally speaking, where the investigation overstepped the limits of experience, to have preferred to develop the difficulties rather than solve them, as is especially apparent in his &quot;Metaphysics&quot;. He was doubtful of Aristotle&#x27;s teleology and recommended that such ideas be used with caution:

He did not follow the incessant attempts by Aristotle to refer phenomena to their ultimate foundations, or his attempts to unfold the internal connections between the latter, and between them and phenomena. In antiquity, it was a subject of complaint that Theophrastus had not expressed himself with precision and consistency respecting God, and had understood it at one time as Heaven, at another an (enlivening) breath (&quot;pneuma&quot;).

=== Ethics ===

Theophrastus did not allow a happiness resting merely upon virtue, or, consequently, to hold fast by the unconditional value of morality. He subordinated moral requirements to the advantage at least of a friend, and had allowed in prosperity the existence of an influence injurious to them. In later times, fault was found with his expression in the &quot;Callisthenes&quot;, &quot;life is ruled by fortune, not wisdom&quot; (&quot;&quot;). That in the definition of pleasure, likewise, he did not coincide with Aristotle, seems to be indicated by the titles of two of his writings, one of which dealt with pleasure generally, the other with pleasure as Aristotle had defined it. Although, like his teacher, he preferred contemplative (theoretical), to active (practical) life, he preferred to set the latter free from the restraints of family life, etc. in a manner of which Aristotle would not have approved.

Theophrastus was opposed to eating meat on the grounds that it robbed animals of life and was therefore unjust. Non-human animals, he said, can reason, sense, and feel just as human beings do.

== The &quot;portrait&quot; of Theophrastus ==
The marble herm figure with the bearded head of philosopher type, bearing the explicit inscription, must be taken as purely conventional. Unidentified portrait heads did not find a ready market in post-Renaissance Rome. This bust was formerly in the collection of marchese Pietro Massimi at Palazzo Massimi and belonged to marchese L. Massimi at the time the engraving was made. It is now in the Villa Albani, Rome (inv. 1034). The inscribed bust has often been illustrated in engravings and photographs: a photograph of it forms the frontispiece to the Loeb Classical Library &quot;Theophrastus: Enquiry into Plants&quot; vol. I, 1916. André Thevet illustrated in his iconographic compendium, (Paris, 1584), an alleged portrait plagiarized from the bust, supporting his fraud with the invented tale that he had obtained it from the library of a Greek in Cyprus and that he had seen a confirming bust in the ruins of Antioch.

== In popular culture ==
A world is named Theophrastus in the 2014 &quot;Firefly&quot; graphic novel &quot;&quot;.

Theodor Geisel used the name &quot;Theophrastus&quot; as the given name of his pen-name alter ego, Dr. Seuss.

A board game named Theophrastus was released in 2001. Players compete through a series of Alchemy experiments in order to become Theophrastus&#x27;s apprentice.

<text>In Egyptian mythology, Petbe was the god of revenge, worshipped in the area around Akhmim, in central Egypt. His name translates as &quot;Sky-Ba&quot;, roughly meaning &quot;Soul of the Sky&quot;, or &quot;Mood of the sky&quot;. However, Petbe may be a Chaldean deity introduced by immigrant workers from the Levant, with his name being a corruption of the hybrid phrase &quot;Pet-(Ba&#x27;al)&quot;, meaning &quot;Lord of the sky&quot;. Early Christians compared Petbe to the Greek god Cronus.

<doc id="98419" wikidata="Q202729" url="?curid=98419" title="Jerry Lee Lewis">
<text>Jerry Lee Lewis (September 29, 1935October 28, 2022) was an American pianist, singer and songwriter. Nicknamed &quot;The Killer&quot;, he was described as &quot;rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&#x27;s first great wild man&quot;. A pioneer of rock and roll and rockabilly music, Lewis made his first recordings in 1952 at Cosimo Matassa&#x27;s J&amp;M Studio in New Orleans, Louisiana, and early recordings in 1956 at Sun Records in Memphis, Tennessee. &quot;Crazy Arms&quot; sold 300,000 copies in the Southern United States, but it was his 1957 hit &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin&#x27; Goin&#x27; On&quot; that shot Lewis to worldwide fame. He followed this with the major hits &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;, &quot;Breathless&quot;, and &quot;High School Confidential&quot;.

His rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to Myra Gale Brown, his 13-year-old first cousin once removed. His popularity quickly eroded following the scandal, and with few exceptions, such as a cover of Ray Charles&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot;, he did not have much chart success in the early 1960s. His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album &quot;Live at the Star Club, Hamburg&quot; is regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever. In 1968, Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as &quot;Another Place, Another Time&quot;. This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis had 30 songs reach the Top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country and Western Chart. His No. 1 country hits included &quot;To Make Love Sweeter for You&quot;, &quot;There Must Be More to Love Than This&quot;, &quot;Would You Take Another Chance on Me&quot;, and &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot;.

Lewis&#x27;s successes continued throughout the decades, and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of The Big Bopper&#x27;s &quot;Chantilly Lace&quot; and Mack Vickery&#x27;s &quot;Rockin&#x27; My Life Away&quot;. In the 21st century, Lewis continued to tour worldwide and released new albums. His 2006 album &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; was his best-selling release, with over a million copies worldwide. This was followed by &quot;Mean Old Man&quot; in 2010, another of his bestselling albums.

Lewis had a dozen gold records in rock and country. He won four Grammy awards, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and two Grammy Hall of Fame Awards. Lewis was inducted into the inaugural class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre was recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. He was also a member of the inaugural class inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2022. In 1989, his life was chronicled in the movie &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;, starring Dennis Quaid. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed his box set &quot;All Killer, No Filler: The Anthology&quot; at number 242 on their list of &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2004, they ranked him No. 24 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Lewis was the last surviving member of Sun Records&#x27; Million Dollar Quartet and the album &quot;Class of &#x27;55&quot;, which also included Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, and Elvis Presley.

Music critic Robert Christgau said of Lewis: &quot;His drive, his timing, his offhand vocal power, his unmistakable boogie-plus piano, and his absolute confidence in the face of the void make Jerry Lee the quintessential rock and roller.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Jerry Lee Lewis was born on September 29, 1935, to Elmo Kidd Lewis Sr. and Mary &quot;Mamie&quot; Herron Lewis in Ferriday, Louisiana. He grew up in an impoverished farming family in Eastern Louisiana. In his youth, he began playing the piano with two of his cousins, Mickey Gilley (later a popular country music singer) and Jimmy Swaggart (later a popular televangelist). His parents mortgaged their farm to buy him a piano. Lewis was influenced by a piano-playing older cousin, Carl McVoy (who later recorded with Bill Black&#x27;s Combo), the radio, and the sounds from Haney&#x27;s Big House, a black juke joint across the tracks. On November 19, 1949, Lewis made his first public performance of his career, playing with a country and western band at a car dealership in Ferriday. The hit of his set was his performance of R&amp;B artist Stick McGhee&#x27;s &quot;Drinkin&#x27; Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee&quot;. On the live album &quot;By Request, More of the Greatest Live Show on Earth&quot;, Lewis is heard naming Moon Mullican as an artist who inspired him.

His mother enrolled him at the Southwest Bible Institute in Waxahachie, Texas, so that he could sing evangelical songs exclusively. When Lewis daringly played a boogie-woogie rendition of &quot;My God Is Real&quot; at a church assembly, it ended his association with the school the same night. Pearry Green, then president of the student body, related how during a talent show Lewis played some &quot;worldly&quot; music. The next morning, the dean of the school called Lewis and Green into his office to expel them. After that incident, he went home and started playing at clubs in and around Ferriday and Natchez, Mississippi, becoming part of the burgeoning new rock and roll sound and cutting his first demo recording in 1952 for Cosimo Matassa in New Orleans. Around 1955, he traveled to Nashville, where he played in clubs and attempted to build interest, but was turned down by the Grand Ole Opry, as he was already at the Louisiana Hayride country stage and radio show in Shreveport.

==Career==
===J&amp;M Studio===
Lewis made his first recordings in 1952 at Cosimo Matassa&#x27;s J&amp;M Recording Studio in New Orleans, Louisiana. He covered Lefty Frizzell&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stay Away (Till Love Grows Cold)&quot; and his own instrumental composition &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Boogie&quot; ( New Orleans Boogie).

===Sun Records===
In November 1956, Lewis traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, to audition for Sun Records. Label owner Sam Phillips was in Florida, but producer and engineer Jack Clement recorded Lewis&#x27;s rendition of Ray Price&#x27;s &quot;Crazy Arms&quot; and his own composition &quot;End of the Road&quot;. In December 1956, Lewis began recording prolifically as a solo artist and as a session musician for other Sun artists, including Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. His distinctive piano playing can be heard on many tracks recorded at Sun in late 1956 and early 1957, including Carl Perkins&#x27;s &quot;Matchbox&quot;, &quot;Your True Love&quot;, and &quot;Put Your Cat Clothes On&quot; and Billy Lee Riley&#x27;s &quot;Flyin&#x27; Saucers Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll&quot;.

On December 4, 1956, Elvis Presley dropped in on Phillips to pay a social visit while Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks with Lewis backing him on piano. Johnny Cash was also there watching Perkins. The four then started an impromptu jam session and Phillips left the tape running. These recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, were released on CD as &quot;Million Dollar Quartet&quot;. Tracks also include Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; and &quot;Paralyzed&quot;, Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Brown Eyed Handsome Man&quot;, and Pat Boone&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Forbid Me&quot;.
Lewis&#x27;s own singles (on which he was billed as &quot;Jerry Lee Lewis And His Pumping Piano&quot;) advanced his career as a soloist during 1957, with hits such as &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin&#x27; Goin&#x27; On&quot;, a Big Maybelle cover, and &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;, his biggest hit, bringing him international fame and criticism of the songs, which prompted some radio stations to boycott them. In 2005, &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin&#x27; Goin&#x27; On&quot; was selected for permanent preservation in the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. According to several first-hand sources, including Johnny Cash, Lewis, a devout Christian, was troubled by the sinful nature of his own material, which he believed was leading him and his audience to Hell. This aspect of Lewis&#x27;s character was depicted in Waylon Payne&#x27;s portrayal of Lewis in the 2005 film &quot;Walk the Line&quot;, based on Cash&#x27;s autobiographies.

As part of his stage act, Lewis pounded the keys with his heel, kicked the piano bench aside and played standing, raking his hands up and down the keys, sat on the keyboard and stood on the piano. He told &quot;the Pop Chronicles&quot; that kicking over the bench originally happened by accident, but when it got a favorable response, he kept it in the act. His inaugural television appearance, in which he demonstrated some of these moves, was on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; on July 28, 1957, where he played &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin&#x27; Goin On&quot;.

His dynamic performance style can be seen in films such as &quot;High School Confidential&quot; (he sang the title song from the back of a flatbed truck), and &quot;Jamboree&quot;. Cub Koda called him &quot;rock &amp; roll&#x27;s first great wild man&quot; and also &quot;rock &amp; roll&#x27;s first great eclectic&quot;. Classical composer Michael Nyman has also cited Lewis&#x27;s style as the progenitor of his own aesthetic.

In 1960, Phillips opened a new state-of-the-art studio at 639 Madison Avenue in Memphis, abandoning the old Union Avenue studio where Phillips had recorded B.B. King, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, Lewis, Johnny Cash, and others, and also opened a studio in Nashville. It was at the latter studio that Lewis recorded his only major hit during this period, a rendition of Ray Charles&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; in 1961. In Europe, other updated versions of &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot; (September 1962 UK) and &quot;Good Golly, Miss Molly&quot; (March 1963) entered the hit parade. On popular EPs, &quot;Hang Up My Rock and Roll Shoes&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Twistin, &quot;Money&quot;, and &quot;Hello Josephine&quot; also became turntable hits, especially in nascent discothèques. Another recording of Lewis playing an instrumental boogie arrangement of the Glenn Miller Orchestra&#x27;s &quot;In the Mood&quot; was issued on the Phillips International label under the pseudonym &quot;The Hawk&quot;.

===Marriage controversy===
Lewis&#x27;s turbulent personal life was hidden from the public until a May 1958 British tour where Ray Berry, a news agency reporter at London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport (the only journalist present), learned about Lewis&#x27;s third wife, Myra Gale Brown. She is Lewis&#x27;s first cousin once removed and was 13 years old when they married—though Lewis, who was 22 years old at the time, claimed she was actually 15. The publicity caused an uproar, and the tour was canceled after only three concerts.

===Smash Records===
Lewis&#x27;s Sun recording contract ended in 1963, and he joined Smash Records, where he made several rock recordings that did not further his career. The team at Smash (a division of Mercury Records) came up with &quot;I&#x27;m on Fire&quot;, a song that they felt would be perfect for Lewis and, as Colin Escott writes in the sleeve to the retrospective &quot;A Half Century of Hits&quot;, &quot;Mercury held the presses, thinking they had found Lewis&#x27;s comeback hit, and it might have happened if the Beatles hadn&#x27;t arrived in America, changing radio playlists almost overnight. Mercury didn&#x27;t really know what to do with Lewis after that.&quot; One of Smash&#x27;s first decisions was to record a retread of his Sun hits, &quot;Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis&quot;, which was inspired by the continuing enthusiasm European fans had shown for Lewis&#x27;s firebrand rock and roll. In June 1963, Lewis returned to the UK for the first time since the scandal that nearly ended his career five years earlier, to headline a performance on the &quot;MV Royal Daffodil&quot;, for a cross-channel rock and roll cruise from Southend, Essex, to Boulogne, France. For this performance, he was backed by Ritchie Blackmore and the Outlaws. None of Lewis&#x27;s early Smash albums, including &quot;The Return of Rock&quot;, &quot;Memphis Beat&quot;, and &quot;Soul My Way&quot;, were commercial successes.

===&quot;Live at the Star Club, Hamburg&quot;===
One major success during these lost years was the concert album &quot;Live at the Star Club, Hamburg&quot;, recorded with the Nashville Teens in 1964, which is considered one of the greatest live albums ever. In Joe Bonomo&#x27;s book &quot;Lost and Found&quot;, producer Siggi Loch stated that the recording setup was uncomplicated, with microphones placed as close to the instruments as possible and a stereo mic placed in the audience to capture the ambience. The results were sonically astonishing, with Bonomo observing, &quot;Detractors complain of the album&#x27;s crashing noisiness, the lack of subtlety with which Jerry Lee revisits the songs, the fact that the piano is mixed too loudly, but what is certain is that Siggi Loch on this spring evening captured something brutally honest about the Killer, about the primal and timeless centre of the very best rock &amp; roll...&quot; The album showcases Lewis&#x27;s skills as a pianist and singer, honed by relentless touring. In a 5-out-of-5-stars review, Milo Miles wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine that &quot;&quot;Live at the Star Club, Hamburg&quot; is not an album, it&#x27;s a crime scene: Jerry Lee Lewis slaughters his rivals in a thirteen-song set that feels like one long convulsion.&quot;

===Country comeback===

Frustrated by Smash&#x27;s inability to score a hit, Lewis was planning on leaving the label when promotions manager Eddie Kilroy pitched the idea of cutting a pure country record in Nashville. With nothing to lose, Lewis agreed to record the Jerry Chesnut song &quot;Another Place, Another Time&quot;, which was released as a single on March 9, 1968, and, to everyone&#x27;s amazement, shot up the country charts. At the time of the release, Lewis had been playing Iago in a rock and roll adaptation of &quot;Othello&quot; called &quot;Catch My Soul&quot; in Los Angeles but was soon rushed back to Nashville to record another batch of songs with producer Jerry Kennedy. What followed was a string of hits that no one could have predicted, although country music always remained a major part of Lewis&#x27;s repertoire. As Colin Escott observes in the sleeve to the 1995 compilation &quot;Killer Country&quot;, the conversion to country music in 1968 &quot;looked at the time like a radical shift, but it was neither as abrupt nor as unexpected as it seemed. Jerry had always recorded country music, and his country breakthrough &#x27;Another Place, Another Time&#x27; had been preceded by countless country records starting with his first, &#x27;Crazy Arms&#x27;, in 1956.&quot; The last time Lewis had had a song on the country charts was with &quot;Pen and Paper&quot; in 1964, which had reached number 36, but &quot;Another Place, Another Time&quot; would go all the way to number 4 and remain on the charts for 17 weeks.

Between 1968 and 1977, Lewis had 17 Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard country chart, including four chart-toppers. Hits include &quot;What&#x27;s Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)&quot;, &quot;To Make Love Sweeter For You&quot;, &quot;She Still Comes Around (To Love What&#x27;s Left of Me)&quot;, &quot;Since I Met You Baby&quot;, &quot;Once More With Feeling&quot;, &quot;One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)&quot;, and &quot;Sometimes A Memory Ain&#x27;t Enough&quot;. The production on his early country albums, such as &quot;Another Place, Another Time&quot; and &quot;She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye&quot;, was sparse, quite different from the slick &quot;Nashville sound&quot; that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. The songs still featured Lewis&#x27;s inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer&#x27;s effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as George Jones and Merle Haggard. In his book &quot;Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story&quot;, biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording &quot;were of the kind they were starting to call &#x27;hard country&#x27;, not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio&quot;.

In a remarkable turnaround, Lewis became the most bankable country star in the world. He was so huge in 1970 that his former Smash producer Shelby Singleton, who purchased Sun Records from Sam Phillips in July 1969, wasted no time in repackaging many of Lewis&#x27;s old country recordings with such effectiveness that many fans assumed they were recent releases. One of his later unreleased Sun recordings, &quot;One Minute Past Eternity&quot;, was issued as a single and soared to number 2 on the country chart, following Lewis&#x27;s recent Mercury hit &quot;She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye&quot;. Singleton would milk these unreleased recordings for years, following &quot;The Golden Cream of the Country&quot; with &quot;A Taste of Country&quot; later in 1970.

===Grand Ole Opry appearance===
Lewis played the Grand Ole Opry only once, on January 20, 1973. As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to &quot;A Half Century of Hits&quot;, he had maintained an ambivalence to Music City ever since he was turned away as an aspiring musician before his glory days at Sun Records: &quot;It was 18 years since he had left Nashville broke and disheartened...Lewis was never truly accepted in Nashville. He didn&#x27;t move there and didn&#x27;t schmooze there. He didn&#x27;t fit in with the family values crowd. Lewis family values weren&#x27;t necessarily worse, but they were different.&quot;

As recounted in a 2015 online &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article by Beville Dunkerly, Lewis opened with his comeback single &quot;Another Place, Another Time&quot;. Ignoring his allotted time constraints—and, thus, commercial breaks—Lewis played for 40 minutes (the average Opry performance is two songs, for about eight minutes of stage time maximum) and invited Del Wood—the one member of the Opry who had been kind to him when he had been there as a teenager—out on stage to sing with him. He also blasted through &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin&#x27; Going On&quot;, &quot;Workin&#x27; Man Blues&quot;, &quot;Good Golly, Miss Molly&quot;, and a number of other classics.

===&quot;The Session&quot; and &quot;Southern Roots&quot;===

Lewis returned to the pop charts with &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot; in 1971 and &quot;Chantilly Lace&quot; in 1972, and this, coupled with a revitalized public interest in vintage rock and roll, inspired Mercury to fly Lewis to London in 1973 to record with a cadre of British and Irish musicians, including Rory Gallagher, Kenney Jones, and Albert Lee. By all accounts the sessions were tense. The remake of Lewis&#x27;s old Sun cut &quot;Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee&quot; was the album&#x27;s hit single, reaching number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart and peaking at number 41 on the pop chart. &quot;The Session&quot; was his highest pop charting album since 1964&#x27;s &quot;Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis&quot;, hitting number 37. It did far better on the country albums chart, rising to number 4. Later that year, he went to Memphis and recorded &quot;Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis&quot;, a soul-infused rock album produced by Huey Meaux. According to Rick Bragg&#x27;s authorized 2014 biography, &quot;the Killer&quot; was in a foul mood when he showed up at Trans Maximus Studios in Memphis to record: &quot;During these sessions, he insulted the producer, threatened to kill a photographer, and drank and medicated his way into but not out of a fog.&quot; During one exchange that can be heard on the 2013 reissue &quot;Southern Roots: The Original Sessions&quot;, Meaux asks Lewis, &quot;Do you wanna try one?&quot;, meaning a take, to which Lewis replies, &quot;If you got enough fuckin&#x27; sense to cut it.&quot; Lewis was still pumping out country albums, although the hits were beginning to dry up. His last big hit with Mercury was &quot;Middle Age Crazy&quot;, which made it to number 4 in 1977.

===Later career===

In 1979, Lewis switched record labels to Elektra and produced the critically acclaimed &quot;Jerry Lee Lewis&quot;, although sales were disappointing. In 1986, Lewis was one of the inaugural inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Although looking frail after several hospitalizations due to stomach problems, Lewis was responsible for beginning an unplanned jam at the end of the evening, which was incorporated into all future events. That year, he returned to Sun Studio in Memphis to team up with Orbison, Cash, and Perkins along with longtime admirers like John Fogerty to create the album &quot;Class of &#x27;55&quot;.

In 1989, a major motion picture based on his early life in rock and roll, &quot;Great Balls of Fire!&quot;, brought him back into the public eye, especially when he decided to re-record all his songs for the movie soundtrack. The film was based on the book by Lewis&#x27;s ex-wife, Myra Gale Lewis, and starred Dennis Quaid as Lewis, Winona Ryder as Myra, and Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Swaggart. The movie focuses on Lewis&#x27;s early career and his relationship with Myra and ends with the scandal of the late 1950s. A year later, in 1990, Lewis made minor news when a new song he recorded called &quot;It Was the Whiskey Talkin&#x27; (Not Me)&quot; was included in the soundtrack to the hit movie &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;. The song is also heard in the movie, playing on the radio. The public downfall of his cousin, televangelist Jimmy Swaggart around the same time, resulted in more adverse publicity to a troubled family. Swaggart is also a piano player, as is another cousin, country music star Mickey Gilley. All three listened to the same music in their youth and frequented Haney&#x27;s Big House, the Ferriday club that featured black blues acts. Lewis and Swaggart had a complex relationship over the years.
In 1998, Lewis toured Europe with Chuck Berry and Little Richard. On February 12, 2005, he was given a Lifetime Achievement Award by The Recording Academy. On September 26, 2006, a new album titled &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; was released, featuring many of rock and roll&#x27;s elite as guest stars. Receiving positive reviews, the album charted on four different Billboard charts, including a two-week stay at number one on the Indie charts. A DVD entitled &quot;Last Man Standing Live&quot;, featuring concert footage with many guest artists, was released in March 2007.
In October 2008, as part of a successful European tour, Lewis appeared at two London shows: a special private show at the 100 Club on October 25, and at the London Forum on October 28 with Wanda Jackson and his sister, Linda Gail Lewis. In August 2009, in advance of his new album, a single entitled &quot;Mean Old Man&quot; was released for download. It was written by Kris Kristofferson. An EP featuring this song and four more was also released on November 11. On October 29, 2009, Lewis opened the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 25th Anniversary concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

In May 2013, Lewis opened a new club on Beale Street in Memphis. Lewis was still considered actively performing in concert, though he had to cancel all shows following his February 28, 2019, stroke, waiting for his doctors&#x27; go-ahead.

In 2017, Lewis had a personal presence at The Country Music Television &quot;Skyville Live&quot; show. It was a specially recorded performance featuring a whole array of artists paying tribute to the music of Lewis.

In March 2020, it was announced that Lewis, together with producer T-Bone Burnett and guitarist James Burton, was recording a new album of gospel covers. It was the first time he entered a recording studio following his stroke. , it is unknown how much progress was made with this gospel album, or if it was ever completed, as nothing from these sessions has been released; Lewis later recorded another gospel album with cousin Jimmy Swaggart that was unrelated to the 2020 project with Burnett and Burton.

On October 27, 2020, to celebrate Lewis&#x27;s 85th birthday, a livestream aired on YouTube, Facebook, and his official website. The livestream special, &quot;Whole Lotta Celebratin&#x27; Goin&#x27; On&quot;, featured appearances and performances by Willie Nelson, Elton John, Mike Love, Priscilla Presley, Joe Walsh, and others. John Stamos served as the host.

&quot;Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind&quot; is a documentary on Lewis, released in 2022 and directed by Ethan Coen. That same year, Lewis and his cousin Jimmy Swaggart collaborated on and released a gospel album, called &quot;The Boys from Ferriday&quot;.
==Final years and death==
Lewis had a minor stroke in Memphis on February 28, 2019, which forced him to cancel several appearances. Lewis died at his home three years later on October 28, 2022, in Nesbit, Mississippi, at the age of 87 due to an illness. His death was mistakenly reported by TMZ two days before he died, with a representative stating that TMZ had reported &quot;erroneously off of an anonymous tip.&quot; His funeral was held on November 5, 2022, in his hometown of Ferriday, Louisiana. The service was officiated by his cousin Jimmy Swaggart and Swaggart&#x27;s son.

==Artistry==
Lewis was an incendiary showman who often played with his fists, elbows, feet, and backside, sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire. Like Chuck Berry&#x27;s guitar playing, Lewis&#x27;s piano style became synonymous with rock and roll, having influenced generations of piano players.

In a 2013 interview with Leah Harper, Elton John recalls that up until &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;, &quot;the piano playing that I had heard had been more sedate. My dad collected George Shearing records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on me, and they were just so great. I learned to play like that.&quot;

Lewis was primarily known for his &quot;boogie-woogie&quot; style, which is characterized by a regular left-hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. Appearing on &quot;Memphis Sounds with George Klein&quot; in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, &quot;He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice-looking man, carried himself real well. I miss Carl very much.&quot; Lewis also cited Moon Mullican as a source of inspiration. Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs.

==Legacy==
Along with Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, and Roy Orbison, Lewis received the first Grammy Award in the spoken-word category for the very rare album of interviews released with some early copies of the &quot;Class of &#x27;55&quot; album in 1986. The original Sun cut of &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot; was elected to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998, and Lewis&#x27;s Sun recording of &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin&#x27; Goin&#x27; On&quot; received this honor in 1999. Only recordings that are at least 25 years old and have left a lasting impression can receive this honor. On February 12, 2005, Lewis received the Recording Academy&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award the day before the Recording Academy&#x27;s main Grammy Awards ceremony, which he also attended.

In June 1989, Lewis was honored for his contribution to the recording industry with a star along Hollywood Boulevard on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On October 10, 2007, Lewis received the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s American Music Masters Award. His next album, &quot;Mean Old Man&quot;, was released in September 2010 and reached No. 30 on the Billboard 200 album chart.

On November 5, 2007, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, honored Lewis with six days of conferences, interviews, a DVD premiere, and film clips, dedicated to him and entitled &quot;The Life And Music of Jerry Lee Lewis&quot;. On November 10, the week culminated with a tribute concert compered by Kris Kristofferson. Lewis was present to accept the American Music Masters Award and closed his own tribute show with a rendition of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;. On February 10, 2008, he appeared with John Fogerty and Little Richard on the 50th Grammy Awards, performing &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot; in a medley with &quot;Good Golly Miss Molly&quot;. On June 4, 2008, Lewis was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame and appeared on &quot;A Capitol Fourth&quot; and performed the finale&#x27;s final act with a medley of &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;, &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin&#x27; Goin On&quot;, and &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;.

In December 2019, Lewis was honored with a Mississippi Country Music Trail marker at his ranch in Nesbit, Mississippi to celebrate his contributions to country music.

In May 2022, Lewis was announced as a member-elect to the Country Music Hall of Fame, to be inducted in October 2022. &quot;This year&#x27;s inductees are trailblazers who each paved their own unique path within country music,&quot; Sarah Trahern, CMA chief executive officer, said. &quot;Jerry Lee, Keith (Whitley), and Joe (Galante) each found their musical callings early in life and displayed a strong-minded and fierce passion for music making. In very different ways, they all have left a lasting impact on the industry and generations of fans alike. I am thrilled to welcome this deserving class to the Country Music Hall of Fame.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m just overwhelmed that they asked me here today,&quot; Lewis, 86, said during an event earlier that week at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, adding that his career had taught him to &quot;be a good person and treat people right.&quot;

==Personal life==
===Family and children===
Lewis was married seven times, including bigamous marriages and a marriage with his underage cousin. He had six children during his marriages.

When Jerry Lee Lewis was 16, he married Dorothy Barton, the daughter of a preacher. The union lasted from February 1952 to October 1953.

Lewis&#x27;s second marriage to Sally Jane Mitcham in September 1953 occurred 23 days before his divorce from Barton was final. They had two children: Jerry Lee Lewis Jr. (1954–1973) and Ronnie Guy Lewis (b. 1956). After four years, he filed for divorce in October 1957. Jerry Lee Lewis Jr. died in 1973, at the age of 19, when the Jeep he was driving overturned. 

His third marriage was to 13-year-old Myra Gale Brown, his first cousin once removed, on December 12, 1957. His divorce from Jane Mitcham was not finalized before the ceremony took place, so he remarried Brown on June 4, 1958. They had two children: Steve Allen Lewis (1959–1962) and Phoebe Allen Lewis (b. 1963). Brown was only 14 years old when their son was born. In 1962, Steve Allen Lewis drowned in a swimming pool accident at the age of 3. In 1970, Brown filed for divorce on the grounds of adultery and abuse, stating that she had been &quot;subject to every type of physical and mental abuse imaginable.&quot;

His fourth marriage was to Jaren Elizabeth Gunn Pate, from October 1971 to June 8, 1982. Pate drowned in a swimming pool at the home of a friend with whom she was staying, several weeks before divorce proceedings could be finalized. They had one daughter, Lori Lee Lewis (b. 1972).

Mary Kathy &quot;K.K.&quot; Jones of San Antonio, Texas, testified in court during Lewis&#x27;s income tax evasion trial in 1984 that she lived with him from 1980 to 1983.

Lewis&#x27;s fifth marriage, to Shawn Stephens, lasted 77 days, from June to August 1983, ending with her death from an overdose of methadone. Journalist Richard Ben Cramer alleged that Lewis abused and may have killed her, neither of which was proven.

His sixth marriage, to Kerrie McCarver, lasted 21 years, from April 1984 to June 2005. They had one child: Jerry Lee Lewis III (b. 1987).

In 1993, Lewis moved to Ireland with his family in what was suggested (but denied) to be a move to avoid issues with the Internal Revenue Service. He lived in a rented house on Westminster Road in Foxrock, Dublin, and during his time there was sued by the German company Neue Constantin Film Production GmbH for failure to appear at a concert in Munich in 1993. Lewis returned to the U.S. in 1997 after his tax issues had been resolved by Irish promoter Kieran Cavanagh.

Lewis lived on a ranch in Nesbit, Mississippi, with his family.

Lewis married his seventh wife, Judith Lewis (née Brown, Myra Gale Brown&#x27;s brother&#x27;s former wife), on March 9, 2012. The next day, Lewis severed business ties with his daughter, Phoebe Lewis-Loftin, who was his manager, and revoked her power of attorney. In 2017, Lewis sued his daughter and her husband Zeke Loftin, claiming that she owed him &quot;substantial sums of money&quot;. In the lawsuit, Lewis, his wife Judith Lewis, and his son Jerry Lee Lewis III also claimed Loftin defamed them on Facebook. Lewis-Loftin and her husband counter-sued, claiming Judith Lewis and Jerry Lee Lewis III interfered in the business relationship. In April 2019, U.S. District Judge Neal Biggers ruled that most of the claims were barred by a three-year statute of limitations except the defamation claims.

===Religious beliefs===
As a teenager, Lewis studied at the Southwest Bible Institute in Waxahachie, Texas, before being thrown out for playing a &#x27;worldly&#x27; boogie-woogie version of &quot;My God Is Real&quot;, and that early incident foreshadowed his lifelong conflict over his faith in God and his love of playing &quot;the devil&#x27;s music&quot;. Lewis had a recorded argument with Sam Phillips during the recording session for &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;, a song he initially refused to record because he considered it blasphemous (&quot;How can... How can the devil save souls? What are you &quot;talkin&#x27; about&quot;?&quot; he asks Phillips during one heated exchange.) During the famous Million Dollar Quartet jam involving Lewis, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash, they performed several gospel songs. Lewis&#x27;s biographer Rick Bragg explains that part of the reason the recording only features Lewis and Elvis singing is because &quot;only Elvis and Jerry Lee [were] raised in the Assembly of God&quot;, and Johnny and Carl didn&#x27;t really know the words... they was Baptists&#x27;, [Lewis] said, and therefore deprived.&quot;

In the 1990 documentary &quot;The Jerry Lee Lewis Story&quot;, Lewis said to the interviewer, &quot;The Bible doesn&#x27;t even speak of religion. No word of religion is even in the Bible. &quot;Sanctification!&quot; Are you sanctified? Have you been &quot;saved&quot;? See, I was a good preacher, I know my Bible? I find myself falling short of the glory of God.&quot;

Gospel music was a staple of his performing repertoire. After a string of hit country albums, he recorded a gospel album for the first time in 1970 (it was released in 1971).

Lewis was also a cousin of the televangelist Jimmy Swaggart.

===Public intoxication arrest===
On September 29, 1976 (Lewis&#x27;s 41st birthday), Lewis fired a .357 Magnum at a Coke bottle in his bedroom. The bullet ricocheted and accidentally hit bassist Butch Owens in the chest. Owens survived.

On November 23, 1976, Lewis was arrested outside Elvis Presley&#x27;s Graceland home for allegedly intending to shoot him. In Rick Bragg&#x27;s 2014 authorized biography, &quot;Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story&quot;, Lewis said that the reclusive Presley had been trying to reach him and finally did on November 23, imploring him to &quot;come out to the house.&quot; Lewis replied that he would if he had time, but that he was busy trying to get his father, Elmo, out of jail in Tunica for driving under the influence. Later that night, Lewis was at a Memphis nightclub called the Vapors drinking champagne when he was given a gun. Lewis suddenly remembered that Elvis wanted to see him and, climbing aboard his new Lincoln Continental with the loaded pistol on the dash, so he wouldn&#x27;t be charged for having a &quot;concealed&quot; weapon, a bottle of champagne under his arm, and tore off for Graceland. Just before three o&#x27;clock in the morning, Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates.

Presley&#x27;s astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle out the car window, not realizing the window was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but &quot;Elvis, watching on the closed-circuit television, told guards to call the police. The Memphis police found the gun in the car and put Lewis, protesting, hollering, threatening them, away in handcuffs.&quot; Lewis said, &quot;The cops asked Elvis, &#x27;What do you want us to do? And Elvis told &#x27;em, &#x27;Lock him up.&#x27; That hurt my feelings. To be scared of me – knowin&#x27; me the way he did – was ridiculous.&quot; Lewis was charged with carrying a pistol and public drunkenness. Released on a $250 bond, his defiant mugshot was wired around the world. Presley himself died at Graceland nine months later.

===Financial debt===

In 1979, the IRS seized property from Lewis to compensate a $274,000 tax debt. The property included several automobiles, a tractor, five motorcycles, jewelry, musical instruments, home entertainment equipment, and firearms. In 1980, an auction was held, but only 150 potential bidders showed up. The auction amassed $91,382, a third of the debt.

In 1984, Lewis was found innocent of evading taxes, but he still owed the IRS money. The next year, the IRS seized property from his Nesbit, Mississippi ranch. In 1988, Lewis filed for bankruptcy, petitioning that he was more than $3 million in debt, including $2 million he owed to the IRS.

<text>Resheph (also Reshef and many other variants, see below; Eblaite , &quot;Rašap&quot;, , &quot;ršp&quot;, Egyptian &quot;&quot;, , &quot;ršp&quot;, &quot;Rešep̄&quot;) was a god associated with war and plague, originally worshiped in Ebla in the third millennium BCE. He was one of the main members of the local pantheon, and was worshiped in numerous hypostases, some of which were associated with other nearby settlements, such as Tunip. He was associated with the goddess Adamma, who was his spouse in Eblaite tradition. Eblaites considered him and the Mesopotamian god Nergal to be equivalents, most likely based on their shared role as war deities. 

In the second millennium BCE, Resheph continued to be worshiped in various cities in Syria and beyond. He is best attested in texts from Ugarit, where he was one of the most popular deities. While well attested in ritual texts and theophoric names, he does not play a large role in Ugaritic mythology. An omen text describes him as the doorkeeper of the sun goddess, Shapash, and might identify him with the planet Mars. He was also venerated in Emar and other nearbly settlements, and appears in theophoric names as far east as Mari. The Hurrians also incorporated him into their pantheon under the name Iršappa, and considered him a god of commerce. Through their mediation, he also reached the Hittite Empire. He was also introduced to Egypt, possibly by the Hyksos, and achieved a degree of prominence there in the Ramesside period, with evidence of a domestic cult available from sites such as Deir el-Medina. The Egyptians regarded him as a warlike god, but he could also be invoked as a protective healer. He was associated with gazelles and horses, and in art appears as an armed deity armed with a bow, shield and arrows.

References to Resheph from the first millennium BCE are less common. He did not play a large role in Phoenician religion overall, with only one reference to him occurring in texts from Sidon, though he is well attested as a member of the Phoenician pantheon of Cyprus. He was also worshiped by Arameans in Cilicia and in Syria. References to him are also present in the Hebrew Bible, though due to the process of demythologization his name does not always refer to a personified deity. Greeks considered him an equivalent of Apollo, as attested by bilingual inscriptions from Cyprus, though it is not certain if this example of &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot; was recognized outside this island.

==Name==
===Etymology===
The etymology of Resheph&#x27;s name is uncertain. According to Michael P. Streck, it is derived from the root &quot;ršp&quot;, and its cognates include Amorite &quot;yarśap&quot; (“to flame”), an element of personal names attested in texts from the Old Babylonian period, and the nominal &quot;rišp-&quot;, “flame” or “fever”, present in Hebrew and Aramaic. This possibility is the most commonly proposed explanation in scholarship, though it did not find universal support, and Maciej M. Münnich notes that it rests on biblical evidence, which comes at most from the sixth century BCE, in contrast with the oldest attestations of Resheph, which date back to the twenty fourth century BCE, with no sources supporting this derivation from within the nearly two thousand year period separating them. Streck, despite his support for this proposal, acknowledges the nature of the connection between the presumed meaning of Resheph&#x27;s name and his character is not fully clear. A second proposal is to link his name with Akkadian &quot;rašābu(m)&quot;, “to destroy”, and &quot;rašbu(m)&quot;, “terrifying, horrible” This view is supported by authors such as Jean-Marie Durand, but it similarly did not find universal support. Paolo Xella notes that all of the proposed etymologies might be the result of circular reasoning, as they depend on the available information about Resheph&#x27;s character.

===Spellings===
Cuneiform texts from Ebla render Resheph&#x27;s name as &quot;Ra-sa-ap&quot; (). No further variants are attested in text from this city, and in most cases the name is preceded by the “divine determinative”, &quot;dingir&quot; (). The same spelling is also attested in sources from Mesopotamia and from Emar, though texts from this city also use variants such as &quot;Ra-ša-ap&quot;, &quot;Ra-šap&quot; and &quot;Ra-šap-pa&quot;. 

In Ugarit, Resheph&#x27;s name was written as &quot;ršp&quot; () in the alphabetic script, and it is variously vocalized by Ugartiologists as Rašp, Rašap or Resheph. The writings &quot;Ra-ši-ip&quot; and &quot;Re-ša-ip&quot; appear in texts in standard syllabic cuneiform. Logographic ones are also attested, many of them derived from the various forms of the theonym Nergal: dGÌR.UNU.GAL(.LA), dMAŠ.MAŠ and dKAL (=dLAMMA), though it is sometimes questioned if Resheph was necessarily meant in every case when they were used. The use of logograms originally linked to Nergal to represent Resheph is also well attested in texts from Ekalte, with identified examples including dGÌR, dIGI and dMAŠ.TAB.BA.

The Hurrian form of the name had a prothetic vowel affixed to it, resulting in spellings Aršappa and Iršappa, sometimes shortened to Iršap or Irša. The Hurrian variant is also attested in Ugarit as &quot;eršp&quot;. It has also been proposed that the variant name &quot;dRa-sa-pa-an&quot; developed through Hurrian influence too, but this view is not universally accepted.

Two forms of the name are attested in texts from ancient Egypt, &quot;ršp&quot; and &quot;ršpw&quot;, which might indicate a change in pronunciation occurred at some point, with the former writing reflecting Rashap, Rashp or Reshp and the latter - Rashpu or Reshpu, with a final u making the name easier to pronounce for speakers of Egyptian. 

===Resheph and Rushpan===
Maciej M. Münnich argues that the theonym Rushpan should be identified as a form of Resheph&#x27;s name used in the Middle Euphrates area. A pre-Sargonic tablet from Mari mentions the offering of cereal to various deities, including &quot;dRa-sa-pá-an&quot;. A temple dedicated to him is mentioned in Mariote texts from the reigns of Shamshi-Adad I and Yahdun-Lim. accepts that the names were likely cognates, but does not consider it certain that the two were identical, pointing out a long tradition of using the logogram dGU4 (“bull”) to represent the name Rushpan, as attested in lexical lists and the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot; (tablet VI, line 206).

==Eblaite sources==
Oldest known references to Resheph have been identified in texts from Ebla. They are dated to the period between 2450 and 2200 BCE, and spans between 30 and 40 years. Most of the available attestations of deities in it come from economic texts, which makes it impossible to fully study the character of Resheph in Eblaite religion as other types of sources, such as myths or descriptions of specific ceremonies, are lacking. It is nonetheless possible to determine he was one of the main deities of the local pantheon. While not equally commonly attested as Hadabal and Kura, he is one of the most frequently mentioned deities in the entire Eblaite text corpus. His individual functions are difficult to clarify. While he was not directly invoked in association with combat, it is nonetheless presumed that he was regarded as a warlike deity due to a large number of weapons listed among offerings he received, including 15 daggers, 11 axes, 4 lances and 2 or more clubs. Alfonso Archi states that the club offering, during which the god also received four bull horns, was an annual rite.

===Worship===

In Ebla Resheph was venerated both by common citizens and the royal family. Reference to two priests in his service, Re’i-Malik and Ennai, are also known. Furthermore, foreign kings visiting Ebla also made offerings to him, as indicated by records of sacrificial sheep provided by the royal palace for such occasions.

One of the city gates of Ebla was named after Resheph. His two main cult centers in its proximity were seemingly Adanni and Tunip, both of which were relatively small settlements. Alfonso Archi notes that an association with an otherwise insignificant city or cities is a characteristic shared by him with a number of the other major deities of Ebla, namely Dagan (from Tuttul), Hadda (from Halab) and Hadabal (from Hamadu, Larugadu and Luban), and that it can be assumed in the third millennium BCE none of them owed their popularity to the political influence of their cult centers. However, despite its proximity to Ebla, Resheph is entirely absent from the text corpus from Tell Beydar.

Multiple hypostases of Resheph are attested in Ebla. Most frequently mentioned is the form of this god linked to Adanni. Resheph of &quot;gunum&quot; is the second most commonly referenced. The precise meaning of this term is a matter of debate, complicated by the fact it is attested almost exclusively in association with Resheph and, much less frequently, with closely linked Adamma. It can be literally translated as “garden”, but it has been suggested it was used to refer to the royal cemetery. However, no texts from Ebla mention Resheph in a funerary context. Maciej M. Münnich suggests that &quot;gunum&quot; might have been a palatial enclosure for animals, as the associated hypostasis of Resheph received wool as offering particularly often, and references to a bull linked to his cult are known. Resheph of Tunip is also attested, chiefly as a recipient of silver. This hypostasis seemingly had no chapel in the city of Ebla itself, and local dignitaries traveled to venerate him. The royal palace hill (&quot;sa-zaxki&quot;) also had a form of Resheph associated with it, &quot;Resheph of the palace&quot;, though it has been proposed this title referred to Resheph of Adanni worshiped in a chapel located there rather than to a fully separate hypostasis. Further forms, associated with Daraum (an administrative center of the Eblaite state), Shi’amu, ‘Adatu, Shamutu, Muriku, Armi, Nei, Sarrap and Shaku, are also attested, but they are mentioned less frequently, with most only occurring once. The large number of hypostases is presumed to reflect Resheph&#x27;s popularity.

Theophoric names invoking Resheph are uncommon in the Eblaite text corpus, which Michael P. Streck explains as a result of his possibly negative characteristics. However, this assumption has been criticized by Maciej M. Münnich, as the attested examples, such as Yitin-Rasap (&quot;Resheph gave&quot;) and ‘Ebdu-Rasap (&quot;servant of Resheph&quot;), do not appear to hint as such a perception.

===Associations with other deities===
Resheph typically received offerings either alongside other major members of the local pantheon, such as Hadabal, or alongside the goddess Adamma. The latter was regarded as his spouse, though the connection between them is seemingly limited to the early tradition of Ebla. They were also worshiped together in Tunip. Resheph also appears commonly alongside the sun deity, represented by the Sumerogram dUTU, though usually regarded as a goddess. He is also attested in association with the Eblaite form of Ea, Hayya. In one case, they occur as a dyad and receive a single jewel as an offering together. 

The text VE 806 indicates that Resheph and the Mesopotamian god Nergal were locally regarded as equivalents. This correspondence most likely depended on their shared warlike character. Despite this connection, no writing of Nergal&#x27;s name was used to represent Resheph in Ebla. Wilfred G. Lambert has noted that a name of Nergal found in a later Mesopotamian god list, &quot;dLUGAL-ra-sa-ap&quot; (; with the Sumerogram LUGAL possibly standing for an unidentified West Semitic noun rather than &quot;lugal&quot; or &quot;šarrum&quot;), “lord Resheph”, uses the spelling of Resheph&#x27;s name typical for Eblaite and Old Akkadian texts from the third millennium BCE.

===Other third millennium BCE attestations===
Sporadic instances of Resheph appearing as a theophoric element in Akkadian personal names have been identified, with one example being Iṣī-Raśap. As pointed out by Maciej M. Münnich, while found in a text from Susa in Elam, this name most likely belonged to a person hailing from a part of Syria conquered by Sargon of Akkad, rather than to a local inhabitant. It is therefore not possible to speak of an active cult of Resheph in this area. A single theophoric name invoking Resheph, Rašap-ilī, has also been identified in an Old Assyrian text, and it is presumed he was the family deity of its bearer. However, Resheph is not otherwise attested in this role in known Old Assyrian sources and Rašap-ilī might have not been an Assyrian himself, as he is only mentioned a document describing business deals in Talhat, a city in Upper Mesopotamia. Klaas R. Veenhof in his discussion of this isolated attestation notes Resheph&#x27;s well attested prominence in northern Syria.

==Second millennium BCE sources==
Resheph continued to be worshiped in the second millennium BCE, and remained a popular deity in a number of areas bordering on the Mediterranean Sea.

===Ugaritic texts===
The corpus of Ugaritic texts has been described as “one of the most abundant collections of data concerning Resheph”. It has been proposed that he arose to prominence in this city in the late Bronze Age. He was associated with both plague and war. He was also connected to the underworld. 

====Associations with other deities====
Ugaritic and Akkadian god lists from Ugarit indicate that the theological view that Resheph and Nergal were analogous to each other was also accepted in this city.

Some evidence exists for an association between Resheph and Ashtart reflecting their shared features, though it is not extensive.

In the standard Ugaritic lists of deities, Resheph follows “auxiliary gods of Baal” (Ugaritic: &quot;il t‘ḏr b‘l&quot;) and precedes Dadmiš. Manfred Krebernik suggests that she might have been linked to Resheph in some way, possibly as his spouse, and additionally points out her name might be related to the Mesopotamian goddess Tadmuštum, who was associated with the underworld. Nicolas Wyatt argues that based on their placement in lists it can be assumed that they were counted among Baal&#x27;s divine helpers, but Dennis Pardee maintains that there is no evidence in favor of viewing either of them as closely linked to the weather god.

====Worship====
The offering list corresponding to the standard deity lists assigns a ram to Resheph as a sacrifice, similarly as to most of the other deities mentioned. In another offering list, he follows Shapash, the sun goddess. Yet another similar text places him after Tiraṯu (a deity representing young wine) and before a hypostasis of Anat, designated by the term &quot;ḫbly&quot;. He received an ewe as a burnt sacrifice in this case. He also appears in a ritual which took place in Ra’šu-Yêni, “first of the wine”, the last month in the Ugaritic lunar calendar, seemingly on the roof of the temple of El, where shrines were set up for various deities in presence of the king. In this case, he received an ewe as a burnt offering, after a similar sacrifice made to Ṯukamuna-wa-Šunama, and later separately a ram as a “peace offering”. RS 19.013, a tablet describing one of the so-called “contemplation rituals” whose form and function remain uncertain, also involves Resheph. He is additionally mentioned alongside various other deities in a short prayer for well-being, which according to Dennis Pardee might list gods viewed as the sons of El. Furthermore, the only among the many votive objects found in Ugarit to be identified by an accompanying inscription as an offering to a specific deity is a drinking vessel shaped like a lion&#x27;s head, which a certain Nūrānu dedicated to &quot;Resheph-&quot;guni&quot;&quot; (&quot;ršp gn&quot;). Pardee assumes that the second element of the name is a toponym, Gunu, according to him a city located somewhere in Syria, though it has also been suggested that this term refers to the royal necropolis in Ugarit, and that it might be related to Eblaite &quot;gunnum&quot;.

A dual or plural form of Resheph&#x27;s name, &quot;ršpm&quot;, is also attested in ritual texts. Sacrifices to this group of deities took place in the royal palace. Manfred Krebernik presumes it can be connected to his various hypostases attested in Ugaritic texts, such as &quot;ršp idrm&quot; (meaning unknown), &quot;ršp bbt&quot; (“Resheph of Bibitta”), &quot;ršp mhbn&quot; (“Resheph of Mōhāban”), &quot;ršp mlk&quot; (“ Resheph of Mulukku”), &quot;ršp ṣbi&quot; (“Resheph of the army”) and &quot;ršp ḥgb&quot; (possibly “Resheph of locusts”). 

Eighty seven inhabitants of Ugarit bearing theophoric names invoking Resheph have been identified in known texts, with four of them being scribes. This makes him the third most common of the deities attested in this context, with El and Baal being more popular and Shapash and Teshub appearing with comparable frequency. The element &quot;ḥgb&quot; also appears in theophoric names on its own, with twenty five individual examples known, and Wilfred H. van Soldt proposed interpreting it as an attribute of Resheph in this context.

====Mythology====
Despite being frequently mentioned in ritual texts and theophoric names, Resheph does not play a large role in Ugaritic mythology. In the &quot;Epic of Keret&quot;, he is responsible for “carrying off” the fifth wife of the eponymous king. The term used has a broad meaning and the exact way in which she died cannot be established. Mark S. Smith has also proposed that Habayu, who in the literary text KTU 1.114 attacks drunk El and smears him with excrement, might be another name of Resheph.

In the text &quot;Horon and the Mare&quot;, Resheph is invoked from Bibitta, a city in Anatolia. He is asked to remove poison alongside many other deities. A thematically similar text dealing with removal of serpent venom focused on Shapash invokes him alongside Yarikh in a sequence of pairs of deities, after El and Horon, Baal and Dagan, and Anat and Ashtart.

====Divination====
In an omen text, RS 12.061, Resheph is addressed as the doorkeeper of the sun goddess Shapash. According to Dennis Pardee, it can be assumed that he functioned as an underworld deity, and that he was responsible for opening the gates of the underworld to let her undertake the nightly portion of her journey. However, the text is likely an allusion to an astronomical phenomenon as well. While attempts have been made to identify it as a report of a solar eclipse, according to Pardee it describes a period of five days during which the planet Mars, corresponding to Resheph, has been observed at sundown, before its heliacal setting made that impossible on the sixth day. Maciej M. Münnich notes that based on Mesopotamian evidence it is possible that Mars was regarded as an ill omen in Ugarit.

RS 24.247+, an Ugaritic omen compendium which deals with teratomancy (telling the future based on observation of malformed animal fetuses) in a manner similar to Akkadian &quot;Šumma Izbu&quot;, states that an animal born with short legs foretells a situation in which “Resheph will consume the progeny”.

===Other Syrian sources===
Many theophoric names invoking Resheph have been identified in texts from Emar. Examples include Ikūr-Rašap (Akkadian: “Resheph has proven to be reliable”), Rašap-kabar (Amorite: “Resheph is great”), Rašap-lā’ī (Amorite: “Resheph is powerful”), as well as names where the theonym is abbreviated, such as Iddin-ra (Akkadian: “Resheph has given”) and Yakūn-ra (Amorite: “Resheph has proven to be reliable”). Overall he is the third most frequently invoked deity in them, after Dagan and Adad. 

It is sometimes assumed that Resheph is not directly attested in ritual texts from Emar. However, Ian Rutherford assumes that the deity referred to as “Nergal of the market (KI.LAM)” or “lord of the market” might be Resheph, which would indicate the name is to be read as &quot;Rašap/bel mahiri&quot;; a connection to trade is not otherwise known for Nergal, but is well attested for Resheph in Hurrian tradition. This identification is also accepted by John Tracy Thames, who notes the epithet presumably reflected his importance in the eyes of a specific section of society, similarly as other titles derived from names of professions. He also proposes that the deity only mentioned under the epithet “Lord of Šagma” in texts from this city might be either Resheph or Erra. Gary Beckman tentatively considers interpreting the city god of Emar, represented by the Sumerogram dNIN.URTA, as Resheph, but he notes caution is advised, and points out Joan Goodnick Westenholz instead suggested that dNIN.URTA in Emar designated a strictly local deity, known as Il Imarī or possibly Ḫamari, “the Emariote god”. It is also sometimes proposed that the deity dU.GUR, who appears alongside Shuwala in a description of a festival, might be Resheph, though this logogram might also be read phonetically as Ugur (a possibility supported by Hurrian sources from the site) or as Nergal.

In addition to the evidence from Emar, Resheph is also attested in texts from Azû and Ekalte. All three of these sites are located in the proximity of each other, and were culturally similar. Amorite theophoric names invoking Resheph have also been identified in texts from Mari and from the kingdom of Khana. However, in the former only seven examples are attested. The proposal that some Mariote attestations of Nergal in personal names and elsewhere should be understood as references to Resheph are regarded as baseless. There is also no evidence that he was ever actively worshiped further south in Mesopotamia.

===Hurrian reception===
Like a number of other deities originally worshiped in Ebla, such as Adamma, Aštabi, Ḫepat and Ishara, Resheph was incorporated into the Hurrian pantheon, as attested in texts from Ugarit, Emar and Alalakh. He was regarded as the tutelary god of the marketplace in Hurrian religion. He was referred to as &quot;damkarrassi&quot;, “of commerce”, a loanword derived from Sumerian DAM.GÀR. He belonged to the circle of deities associated with Teshub, and in standard offering lists () he typically appears between Ḫešui and Tenu.

Three theophoric names invoking the Hurrian form of Resheph have been identified in the Ugaritic texts. One example is Tagi-Irshappa, “Irshappa is beautiful”. In Alalakh, the evidence for the worship of Resheph is limited to two certain and four dubious theophoric names, with both of the former, Irshappa (either an abbreviation or a personal name identical with the Hurrian variant of the theonym) and Irshapi-andi, being Hurrian.

Manfred Krebernik has suggested that the fact that in a single Ugaritic text Resheph is invoked from Bibitta, elsewhere described as a cult center of the Hurrian god Nupatik, might indicate that he was locally equated with that god. The existence of a connection between them is also accepted by Maciej M. Münnich. Aicha Rahmouni notes that an epithet of Nupatik attested in Hittite sources, dLAMMA KI.KAL.BAD, “Nupatik of the army”, is semantically a parallel of Resheph&#x27;s Ugaritic title, “Resheph of the army”.

The Hurrian form of Resheph was among the deities incorporated into the Hittite pantheon in Samuha and the Hittite capital Hattusa under the influence of Hurrian religion. The evidence for the association between Resheph and trade is also present in Hittite texts, for example a festival tied to the cults of Samuha refers to him with the epithet &quot;damkarrassi&quot;.

===Egyptian reception===
The Egyptian data pertaining to the worship of Resheph is considered difficult to collect and analyze due to being largely limited to dispersed royal and private monuments. He most likely was already known in Egypt during the reign of the Thirteenth Dynasty. He might have been originally introduced by the Hyksos. The oldest available evidence for his presence in Egypt is the theophoric name of a brewer originating in Syria or Canaan, ‘Apra-Reshpu, who lived during the reign of Sobekhotep III. First direct references to the worship of Resheph occur during the reign of Amenhotep II (1425 - 1399 BCE), similarly as in the case of a number of other northern deities, such as Hauron and Astarte. The pharaoh himself mentions him on a stele found in the proximity of the Great Sphinx of Giza, and in an inscription from a temple of Amun in Karnak. In another inscription he describes himself crossing the Orontes River in a manner comparable to Resheph, which is presumably meant to highlight his courage and mark him as a great warrior. 

====Character====
Egyptians regarded Resheph primarily as a warlike god. This aspect of his character is well attested in royal inscriptions. Especially commonly, he appears in association with horseback or chariot warfare. A different side of Resheph is portrayed in private dedications, where he is never invoked in association with combat, and instead functions as a benevolent deity capable of securing the petitioner&#x27;s health and welfare. He was depicted as an armed warrior on accompanying images, but in this context these attributes most likely had an apotropaic purpose and reflected his protective qualities and his ability to overcome demons. Akha, believed to cause abdominal pain, was considered his enemy. In the Chester Beaty papyrus, which enumerates deities protecting specific body parts from poison, depending on translation Resheph is responsible either for bone marrow, uterus, a part of male genitals, or an unidentified body part. 

Relatively few epithets were assigned to Resheph in Egyptian sources and the most common of them, “great god” (20 occurrences identified as of 2013) was not exclusive to him and does not highlight any of his individual traits. He was also referred to as “hearer of prayer”, “healer” and “giver of health”, which reflects his association with healing.

====Iconography====

Christiane Zivie-Coche notes that as in the case of other foreign deities incorporated into the Egyptian pantheon, Resheph&#x27;s Egyptian iconography was primarily meant to illustrate his functions, rather than his place of origin. However, it has been argued that the kilt with tassels he was usually depicted in marked him as a foreign deity. He was often portrayed as a so-called “menacing god”, with one arm raised above head and brandishing a weapon. His attributes include a shield, a bow and arrows. Despite his character, he was never depicted attacking enemies, and seemingly art highlighted his protective aspect. Sometimes a lute could serve as one of his symbols. One example of a stele depicting him with this instrument on his back, presumed to originate in Hurbeit, has been identified in the collection of the Roemer- und Pelizaeus-Museum Hildesheim.

Resheph could be depicted either with a fake beard similar to those known from depictions of Osiris, or with a thick natural beard typical for depictions of foreigners. In the latter case he could also be shown with long hair. One of the inscriptions identified on objects originating in Deir el-Medina states that he had a “beautiful face”.

For uncertain reasons, the gazelle was associated with Resheph in Egypt. However, the connection with this animal was not exclusive to him, as it also served as a symbol of Shed. The iconography of these two gods is however otherwise “totally different”. A gazelle head could be depicted on Resheph&#x27;s white crown in place of an uraeus, though in some cases the latter decoration is attested too. In a single case similar headwear dedicated with a gazelle has been assigned to the god Keserty, who according to Izak Cornelius should be identified as Kothar-wa-Khasis rather than Resheph. An association between Resheph and horses is also attested, and presumably reflected his military prowess. Depictions of Resheph as a charioteer or horseman might represent an exclusively Egyptian tradition.

====Associations with other deities====

Due to his warlike character, Resheph could be associated with Montu and Set. One of the reliefs from the temple of Amun in Karnak from the reign of Amenhotep II directly refers to “Montu-Resheph”. It has been suggested that Resheph was also identified with Heryshaf. An inscription from Byblos dated to the period between 1900 and 1600 BCE which mentions the latter deity has been interpreted as an example of his name being used to refer to Resheph, though this proposal is regarded as unlikely. No certain attestations of Resheph have been identified in sources from this city. It has also been noted that in Egypt, Resheph and Herishef could be mentioned together without necessarily being identified.

Multiple references to Resheph being worshiped as a member of a triad which also included Min and Qadesh are known. These three deities are depicted for example on the stele of Ramose. In this context, Resheph was seemingly primarily invoked as a protective deity of specific individuals.

The Leiden Magical Papyrus, dated to the Ramesside Period, mentions a deity identified as the wife of Resheph, Itum, but while attempts have been made to connect her with Eblaite Adamma or less plausibly with the toponym Edom, her identity remains uncertain.

====Worship====
Excavations revealed evidence of veneration of Resheph in Deir el-Medina. Many of his worshipers living in this area were workers, though there is no indication that most of them were foreigners, as Egyptian names predominate. A total of twelve steles inscribed with his name have been discovered at this site. They belonged to the sphere of domestic cult, and based on their size it is assumed that they were originally held in household shrines, presumably with tables for offerings placed in front of them. In 2006, a stele depicting Resheph and Astarte was also discovered in Tell el-Borg. It is presumed that it dates to the reign of Amenhotep II or earlier. It was erected by an overseer of horses, Betu, whose name is not common in Egyptian sources and might have Hurrian origin. The inscription refers to Resheph with the otherwise unknown epithet, “lord of the estate of the stable of horses”. Presumably it was meant to highlight the devotee&#x27;s close link to him.

According to Richard H. Wilkinson, a temple dedicated to Resheph existed in Memphis. Izak Cornelius instead interprets the available evidence as an indication that he was venerated within a sanctuary located in the temple of Ptah.

The worship of Resheph is also attested in Nubia, possibly as a result of religious policies of Amenhotep II. A stele from Wadi es-Sebua, while discovered in a historically Nubian area, was dedicated to Resheph by a certain Mati-Ba’al, presumed to be a merchant traveling through this area rather than a local inhabitant.

==First millennium BCE sources==
Resheph continued to be worshiped in the first millennium BCE. However, references to him are much less frequent than in the preceding millennia.

===Phoenician sources===

References to the worship of Resheph in Phoenician cities are scarce, and he did not play a significant role in Phoenician religion. Attestations are largely limited to toponyms and onomastics. No references to offerings, statues or altars are known, and even the Phoenician theophoric names invoking him are uncommon and exclusively attested in sources from Egypt, which might indicate they were only used by members of the diaspora. The oldest Phoenician text mentioning Resheph, the Karatepe bilingual, comes from outside Phoenicia. It is attributed to the local Cilician ruler Azatiwada. While it references Resheph, due to absence of theophoric names invoking him it is not certain to what capacity he was actively worshiped by the Phoenician inhabitants of this area, and his presence might rely on the need to include a god possible to treat as an equivalent of Luwian Runtiya. He is designated by a unique epithet in this context, &quot;șprm&quot;, possibly “of the goats” or “of the stags”. Translators most commonly presume that the title is a cognate of Hebrew &quot;ṣāpîr&quot;, with additional support for the view that an animal is meant coming from the fact that Runtiya is typically described as a “stag god” and from to Resheph&#x27;s well attested association with gazelles in Egyptian sources.

Only a single source mentioning Resheph comes from Phoenicia itself. An inscription of king Bodashtart from Sidon mentions a district named after him. However, it is possible that this toponym was not linked to an active cult, and only constituted a relic of past practices. A number of difficult to precisely date Phoenician sculptures from the eighth or seventh century BCE from locations such as Gadir, Huelva, Selinous and Samos are sometimes interpreted as representations of Resheph, though Melqart is a possibile identification as well.

No evidence for the worship of Resheph in Punic cities exists. A single text mentions a person bearing a theophoric name invoking him, a certain Abd-Rashap, though the individual in mention originated in Egypt. Most of the references to purported Punic evidence for the worship of Resheph in older scholarly literature are the result of misreading the theonym Eresh (&quot;‘rš&quot;), well attested in theophoric names, or the title “Baal of the cape” (&quot;rš&quot;).
Cyprus is an exception from the scarcity of Phoenician attestations of Resheph. Sources from this area are the richest corpus of texts mentioning him from the first millennium BCE. Similarly as the evidence for the worship of Anat from this area this might indicate a continuity of traditions originating in the Bronze Age, when both of these deities were most commonly venerated. The oldest possible reference to Resheph being known to Cypriots is one of the Amarna letters, written by the king of Alashiya, in which the “hand” of a deity represented in cuneiform by the logogram dMAŠ.MAŠ, most likely him rather than Nergal in this context, is blamed for the death of local coppersmiths. This is presumed to be the description of a plague which struck the kingdom. It has also been proposed that an early bronze statue of a horned god from Enkomi might be a representation of Resheph. Later on Resheph&#x27;s cult center on the island was Idalion. Four dedications to him from the reign of a local ruler, Milkyaton, have been found in this city. A bilingual inscription from Kition dated to 341 BCE mentions Resheph under the epithet &quot;ḥṣ&quot;, whose interpretation remains uncertain, with proposals such as “arrow” (&quot;hēs&quot;) or “street” (&quot;hūs&quot;) being present in scholarship. The former view is more common, and finds support in his iconography. Despite Resheph&#x27;s prominence on Cyprus, the number of theophoric names invoking him from this area is small.

===Aramaic sources===
In the eighth and seventh centuries, Resheph was worshiped in Cilicia. However, the evidence is limited to two inscriptions. One of them is Aramaic, and has been attributed to Panamuwa I of Samʼal. He is mentioned alongside Hadad, El, Rakib-El and Shamash, the main deities of the local pantheon. However, he is absent from a similar text on a monument set up by Bar Rakib for his father. His absence might indicate that in the former case he should only be interpreted as a personal protective deity of the king.

Resheph is also mentioned alongside Kubaba on an Aramaic stela from Tell Sifr, a site located near Aleppo, but due to the state of its preservation it provides little information about his position in the local pantheon and his relation to the aforementioned goddess, though according to Maciej M. Münnich it does make it possible to establish that locally he must have been worshiped by members of high strata of society, capable of commissioning such monuments. Two Aramaic texts from Palmyra mention Resheph, in both cases alongside two goddesses, Ḥirta and Nanaya; he is also attested in the Greek version of one of them alongside Hera and Artemis.

Aramaic sources do not appear to treat Resheph as a deity of disease, and instead stress his protective character, which might have been the reason behind his association with the Arabian god Ruda, “well disposed”, possibly brought northwards by migrating Aramean tribes from the Syrian Desert. Another possibility is that this portrayal of Resheph was influenced by Ruda in the first place.

===Hebrew Bible===
References to Resheph are present in the Hebrew Bible, though compared to deities such as Baal he is not mentioned frequently. It is assumed that before the Babylonian Exile, Resheph might have been regarded as a minor deity inflicting diseases on behalf of Yahweh, while by the time of the compilation of the Book of Chronicles, in the fourth or third century BCE, he was no longer worshiped by the Hebrews. Eventually his name came to be understood as a common noun. In Biblical Hebrew, &quot;resheph&quot; means &quot;flame, firebolt&quot;, derived from &quot;to burn&quot;. Individual biblical passages show varying degrees of demythologization, therefore the name is not always used to refer to a personified figure, and sometimes serves only as a poetic metaphor. Echoes of Resheph&#x27;s role as a god of plague have been identified in Deuteronomy 32:24 and Psalm 78:48. In both cases, he is represented as a tool of divine wrath. He is also mentioned in Habakkuk 3:5, according to Theodore Hiebert as a personified figure acting as the attendant of Yahweh (Eloah), though most contemporary translations treat the name as a common noun in this case. He is paired in this context with Deber, presumably also originally a personified deity. The passage most likely reflects the image of Yahweh as a great god accompanied by an entourage of lesser deities, similar to examples known from Ugaritic and Mesopotamian literature, such as the reference to Adad&#x27;s servants Shullat and Hanish in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. In the Job 5:7, there is mention of the &quot;sons of &quot;resheph&quot;&quot;, translated in the Septuagint as , &quot;the young of the vulture&quot;.

Only one theophoric name invoking Resheph has been identified in the Bible, specifically in 1 Chronicles 7:25, where an individual named Resheph is mentioned as a son of Ephraim. While uncommon, the use of a theonym itself as a theophoric name is not unparalleled.

===Greco-Roman reception===

The form of Resheph worshiped on Cyprus was identified with Apollo by the Greeks. The Idalion bilingual refers to “Resheph Mikal” () in Phoenician and Apollo Amyklos in Cypro-syllabic Greek, but it is not certain if a Greek epithet was adopted by Phoenicians or a Phoenician one by Greeks. There is no evidence of this equation extending beyond said island, though Paolo Xella argues that Pausanias&#x27; mention of Apollo as the father of the Phoenician god Eshmun might be an account of a tradition which originally involved Resheph instead. The association between Resheph and Apollo relied on their shared portrayal as archers, affinity with diseases, and apotropaic functions. Javier Teixidor in particular stressed the parallels between Resheph as a plague god who strikes his victims with arrows as attested in an inscription from Idalion with the Homeric portrayal of Apollo (&quot;Iliad&quot; ). A local Cypriot deity, Hylates, might have been identified with Resheph as well.

In the Greco-Roman period Resheph apparently ceased to be worshiped in Egypt, with the only references to him including a dedication of Ptolemy III Euergetes from Karnak, litanies listing many deities from &quot;Papyrus of Imuthes&quot; and &quot;Tebtunis Papyrus&quot;, unlikely to reflect widespread personal cult, and possibly a small number of theophoric names whose restoration is a matter of dispute among researchers.

It has been proposed that Arsippus, who is mentioned in the third book of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Natura Deorum&quot; alongside Astronoe (an ordinary Persian name, here possibly a corruption of Damaskios’ Astronoe) as the father of one of the multiple deities named Aesculapius, can be interpreted as a Latiniziation of Resheph. However, this view is not universally accepted.
