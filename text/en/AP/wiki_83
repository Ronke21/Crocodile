<text>The flag of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic was officially adopted by the former Soviet Union in 1940. It showed a set of communist symbols: a yellow hammer and sickle on a red field and, after official change of the flag&#x27;s design in 1953, also an outlined yellow star, above a band of water waves near the bottom.

==History==
After the Soviet invasion and occupation of Estonia in June 1940, the country was annexed to, and became an administrative subdivision of, the USSR under the name &quot;Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic&quot; in August 1940. After 31 October 1940, a Soviet flag with Latin script &quot;ENSV&quot; replacing the star above the hammer and sickle, was officially used by the Soviet authorities in the Estonian SSR. On 6 February 1953, a new version of the flag was adopted. It too followed the style of the flag of the Soviet Union, with six spiky blue and white wavy stripes added to the bottom, a reference to the Baltic Sea.

During the period of foreign rule in 1940–1991, the Estonian diaspora and diplomatic service around the world continued to use the national flag of Estonia, whereas the use of the national tricolour and its blue, black and white colour combination was banned and punishable by law in the Soviet Union until 1988.

On 20 October 1988, the usage of the blue-black-white flag was officially allowed again by Estonian authorities. On the evening of 23 February 1989 the Soviet flag was taken down permanently from the tower of Pikk Hermann of the Toompea Castle. It was replaced with the national blue-black-white flag on the next morning, 24 February, upon the 70th anniversary of the Estonian Declaration of Independence.

With the &quot;Act on symbols of Estonia&quot;, passed on 8 May 1990, a year before Estonia regained full independence in 1991, the use of the Estonian SSR flag and emblem as state symbols was officially discontinued.

<text>Norwich () is a cathedral city and district of the county of Norfolk, England, of which it is the county town. It lies by the River Wensum, about north-east of London, north of Ipswich and east of Peterborough. The population of the Norwich City Council local authority area was estimated to be 144,000 in 2021, which was an increase from 143,135 in 2019. The wider Norwich built-up area had a population of 213,166 in 2019.

As the seat of the See of Norwich, the city has one of the country&#x27;s largest medieval cathedrals. For much of the second millennium, from medieval to just before industrial times, Norwich was one of the most prosperous and largest towns of England; at one point, it was second only to London. Today, it is the largest settlement in East Anglia.

==Heritage and status==
Norwich claims to be the most complete medieval city in the United Kingdom. It includes cobbled streets such as Elm Hill, Timber Hill and Tombland; ancient buildings such as St Andrew&#x27;s Hall; half-timbered houses such as Dragon Hall, The Guildhall and Strangers&#x27; Hall; the Art Nouveau of the 1899 Royal Arcade; many medieval lanes; and the winding River Wensum that flows through the city centre towards Norwich Castle.

In May 2012, Norwich was designated England&#x27;s first UNESCO City of Literature. One of the UK&#x27;s popular tourist destinations, it was voted by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2016 as the &quot;happiest city to work in the UK&quot; and in 2013 as one of the best small cities in the world by &quot;The Times Good University Guide&quot;. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, Norwich was voted one of the &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in the UK by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

==History==
===Origin===
The capital of the Iceni tribe was a settlement located near to the village of Caistor St Edmund on the River Tas about to the south of modern Norwich. After an uprising led by Boudica in about 60 AD, the Caistor area became the Roman capital of East Anglia named &quot;Venta Icenorum&quot;, literally &quot;marketplace of the Iceni&quot;. This fell into disuse about 450 AD.

The Anglo-Saxons settled the site of the modern city some time between the 5th and 7th centuries, founding the towns of &quot;Northwic&quot; (&quot;North Farm&quot;), from which Norwich takes its name, and &quot;Westwic&quot; (at Norwich-over-the-Water) and a lesser settlement at Thorpe. Norwich became settled as a town in the 10th century and then became a prominent centre of East Anglian trade and commerce.

===Early English and Norman conquest===
It is possible that three separate early Anglo-Saxon settlements, one north of the river and two either side on the south, joined as they grew; or that a single Anglo-Saxon settlement, north of the river, emerged in the mid-7th century after the abandonment of the previous three. The ancient city was a thriving centre for trade and commerce in East Anglia in 1004 when it was raided and burnt by Swein Forkbeard, the Viking king of Denmark. Mercian coins and shards of pottery from the Rhineland dating from the 8th century suggest that long-distance trade was happening long before this. Between 924 and 939, Norwich became fully established as a town, with its own mint. The word &quot;Norvic&quot; appears on coins across Europe minted during this period, in the reign of King Athelstan. The Vikings were a strong cultural influence in Norwich for 40 to 50 years at the end of the 9th century, setting up an Anglo-Scandinavian district near the north end of present-day King Street. 

At the time of the Norman Conquest, the city was one of the largest in England. The Domesday Book states that it had approximately 25 churches and a population of between 5,000 and 10,000. It also records the site of an Anglo-Saxon church in Tombland, the site of the Saxon market place and the later Norman cathedral. Norwich continued to be a major centre for trade, described officially as the Port of Norwich. Quern stones and other artefacts from Scandinavia and the Rhineland have been found during excavations in Norwich city centre. These date from the 11th century onwards.

Norwich Castle was founded soon after the Norman Conquest. The Domesday Book records that 98 Saxon homes were demolished to make way for the castle. The Normans established a new focus of settlement around the Castle and the area to the west of it: this became known as the &quot;New&quot; or &quot;French&quot; borough, centred on the Normans&#x27; own market place, which survives today as Norwich Market, the largest permanent undercover market in Europe.

In 1096, Herbert de Losinga, Bishop of Thetford, began construction of Norwich Cathedral. The chief building material for the Cathedral was limestone, imported from Caen in Normandy. To transport the building stone to the site, a canal was cut from the river (from the site of present-day Pulls Ferry) up to the east wall. Herbert de Losinga then moved his See there, to what became the cathedral church for the Diocese of Norwich. The Bishop of Norwich still signs himself &quot;Norvic&quot;. Norwich received a royal charter from Henry II in 1158, and another from Richard the Lionheart in 1194. After a riot in the city in 1274, Norwich has the distinction of being the only complete English city to be excommunicated by the Pope.

===Middle Ages===
The first recorded presence of Jews in Norwich is 1134. In 1144, the Jews of Norwich were falsely accused of ritual murder after a boy (William of Norwich) was found dead with stab wounds. William acquired the status of martyr and was subsequently canonised. Pilgrims made offerings to a shrine at the Cathedral (largely finished by 1140) up to the 16th century, but the records suggest there were few of them. In 1174, Norwich was sacked by the Flemings. In February 1190, all the Jews of Norwich were massacred except for a few who found refuge in the castle. 

At the site of a medieval well, the bones of 17 individuals, including 11 children, were found in 2004 by workers preparing the ground for construction of a Norwich shopping centre. The remains were determined by forensic scientists to be most probably the remains of such murdered Jews, and a DNA expert determined that the victims were all related so that they probably came from one Ashkenazi Jewish family. The study of the remains featured in an episode of the BBC television documentary series &quot;History Cold Case&quot;. A research paper from 30 August 2022 confirmed the remains were most likely Ashkenazi Jews. The paper found that many of the victims had certain medical disorders most often seen in Ashkenazi communities, suggesting that a population bottleneck had occurred among Ashkenazim before the 12th century. This challenged traditional views among historians that the bottleneck had happened between the 14th and 16th centuries.

In 1216, the castle fell to Louis, Dauphin of France, and Hildebrand&#x27;s Hospital was founded, followed ten years later by the Franciscan Friary and Dominican Friary. The Great Hospital dates from 1249 and the College of St Mary in the Field from 1250. In 1256, Whitefriars was founded. In 1266 the city was sacked by the &quot;Disinherited&quot;. It has the distinction of being the only English city ever to be excommunicated, following a riot between citizens and monks in 1274. 

From 1280 to 1340 the city walls were built. At around , these walls, along with the river, enclosed a larger area than that of the City of London. However, when the city walls were constructed it was made illegal to build outside them, inhibiting the expansion of the city. Part of these walls remains standing today. Around this time, the city was made a county corporate and became the seat of one of the most densely populated and prosperous counties of England. The engine of trade was wool from Norfolk&#x27;s sheepwalks. Wool made England rich, and the staple port of Norwich &quot;in her state doth stand With towns of high&#x27;st regard the fourth of all the land&quot;, as Michael Drayton noted in &quot;Poly-Olbion&quot; (1612). The wealth generated by the wool trade throughout the Middle Ages financed the construction of many fine churches, so that Norwich still has more medieval churches than any other city in Western Europe north of the Alps. Throughout this period Norwich established wide-ranging trading links with other parts of Europe, its markets stretching from Scandinavia to Spain and the city housing a Hanseatic warehouse. To organise and control its exports to the Low Countries, Great Yarmouth, as the port for Norwich, was designated one of the staple ports under the terms of the 1353 Statute of the Staple.

===Early modern period (1485–1640)===
Hand-in-hand with the wool industry, this key religious centre experienced a Reformation significantly different from that in other parts of England. The magistracy in Tudor Norwich unusually found ways of managing religious discord whilst maintaining civic harmony.

The summer of 1549 saw an unprecedented rebellion in Norfolk. Unlike popular challenges elsewhere in the Tudor period, it appears to have been Protestant in nature. For several weeks, rebels led by Robert Kett camped outside Norwich on Mousehold Heath and took control of the city on 29 July 1549 with the support of many of its poorer inhabitants. Kett&#x27;s Rebellion was particularly in response to the enclosure of land by landlords, leaving peasants with nowhere to graze their animals, and the general abuses of power by the nobility. The uprising ended on 27 August when the rebels were defeated by an army. Kett was convicted of treason and hanged from the walls of Norwich Castle.

Unusually in England, the rebellion divided the city and appears to have linked Protestantism with the plight of the urban poor. In the case of Norwich, this process was underscored later by the arrival of Dutch and Flemish &quot;Strangers&quot; fleeing persecution from the Catholics and eventually numbering as many as one-third of the city&#x27;s population. Large numbers of such exiles came to the city, especially Flemish Protestants from the Westkwartier (&quot;Western Quarter&quot;), a region in the Southern Netherlands where the first Calvinist fires of the Dutch Revolt had spread. Inhabitants of Ypres, in particular, chose Norwich above other destinations. Perhaps in response to Kett, Norwich became the first provincial city to initiate compulsory payments for a civic scheme of poor relief, which it has been claimed led to its wider introduction, forming the basis of the later Elizabethan Poor Law of 1597–1598.

Norwich has traditionally been the home of various minorities, notably Flemish and Belgian Walloon communities in the 16th and 17th centuries. The great &quot;stranger&quot; immigration of 1567 brought a substantial Flemish and Walloon community of Protestant weavers to Norwich, where they are said to have been made welcome. The merchant&#x27;s house which was their earliest base in the city — now a museum — is still known as Strangers&#x27; Hall. It seems that the strangers integrated into the local community without much animosity, at least among the business fraternity, who had the most to gain from their skills. Their arrival in Norwich boosted trade with mainland Europe and fostered a movement towards religious reform and radical politics in the city. By contrast, after being persecuted by the Anglican church for his Puritan beliefs, Michael Metcalf, a 17th-century Norwich weaver, fled the city and settled in Dedham, Massachusetts.

The Norwich Canary was first introduced into England by Flemings fleeing from Spanish persecution in the 16th century. Along with their advanced techniques in textile working, they brought pet canaries, which they began to breed locally, eventually becoming in the 20th century a mascot of the city and the emblem of its football club, Norwich City F.C.: &quot;The Canaries&quot;. Printing was introduced to the city in 1567 by Anthony de Solempne, one of the strangers, but it did not take root and had died out by about 1572. Norwich&#x27;s coat of arms was first recorded in 1562. It is described as: &quot;Gules a Castle triple-towered and domed Argent in base a Lion passant guardant [or Leopard] Or.&quot; The castle is supposed to represent Norwich Castle and the lion, taken from the Royal Arms of England, may have been granted by King Edward III.

===Civil War to Victorian era===
In the English Civil War, across the Eastern Counties, Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s powerful Eastern Association was eventually dominant. However, to begin with, there had been a large element of Royalist sympathy within Norwich, which seems to have experienced a continuity of its two-sided political tradition throughout the period. Bishop Matthew Wren was a forceful supporter of Charles I. Nonetheless, Parliamentary recruitment took hold. The strong Royalist party was stifled by a lack of commitment from the aldermen and isolation from Royalist-held regions. Serious inter-factional disturbances culminated in &quot;The Great Blow&quot; of 1648 when Parliamentary forces tried to quell a Royalist riot. The latter&#x27;s gunpowder was set off by accident in the city centre, causing mayhem. According to Hopper, the explosion &quot;ranks among the largest of the century&quot;. Stoutly defended though East Anglia was by the Parliamentary army, there were said to have been pubs in Norwich where the king&#x27;s health was still drunk and the name of the Protector sung to ribald verse.

At the cost of some discomfort to the Mayor, the moderate Joseph Hall was targeted because of his position as Bishop of Norwich. Norwich was marked in the period after the Restoration of 1660 and the ensuing century by a golden age of its cloth industry, comparable only to those in the West Country and Yorkshire, but unlike other cloth-manufacturing regions, Norwich weaving brought greater urbanisation, mainly concentrated in the surrounds of the city itself, creating an urban society, with features such as leisure time, alehouses and other public forums of debate and argument.

Norwich in the late 17th century was riven politically. Churchman Humphrey Prideaux described &quot;two factions, Whig and Tory, and both contend for their way with the utmost violence.&quot; Nor did the city accept the outcome of the 1688 Glorious Revolution with a unified voice. The pre-eminent citizen, Bishop William Lloyd, would not take the oaths of allegiance to the new monarchs. One report has it that in 1704 the landlord of Fowler&#x27;s alehouse &quot;with a glass of beer in hand, went down on his knees and drank a health to James the third, wishing the Crowne [sic] well and settled on his head.&quot;

Writing of the early 18th century, Pound describes the city&#x27;s rich cultural life, the winter theatre season, the festivities accompanying the summer assizes, and other popular entertainments. Norwich was the wealthiest town in England, with a sophisticated system of poor relief, and a large influx of foreign refugees. Despite severe outbreaks of plague, the city had a population of almost 30,000. This made Norwich unique in England, although there were some 50 cities of similar size in Europe. In some, like Lyon and Dresden, this was, as in the case of Norwich, linked to an important proto-industry, such as textiles or china pottery, in some, such as Vienna, Madrid and Dublin, to the city&#x27;s status as an administrative capital, and in some such as Antwerp, Marseille and Cologne to a position on an important maritime or river trade route.

In 1716, at a play at the &quot;New Inn&quot;, the Pretender was cheered and the audience booed and hissed every time King George&#x27;s name was mentioned. In 1722 supporters of the king were said to be &quot;hiss&#x27;d at and curst as they go in the streets,&quot; and in 1731 &quot;a Tory mobb, in a great body, went through several parts of this city, in a riotous manner, cursing and abusing such as they knew to be friends of the government.&quot; However the Whigs gradually gained control and by the 1720s they had successfully petitioned Parliament to allow all adult males working in the textile industry to take up the freedom, on the correct assumption that they would vote Whig. But it had the effect of boosting the city&#x27;s popular Jacobitism, says Knights, and contests of the kind described continued in Norwich well into a period in which political stability had been discerned at a national level. The city&#x27;s Jacobitism perhaps only ended with 1745, well after it had ceased to be a significant movement outside Scotland. Despite the Highlanders reaching Derby and Norwich citizens mustering themselves into an association to protect the city, some Tories refused to join in, and the vestry of St Peter Mancroft resolved that it would not ring its bells to summon the defence. Still, it was the end of the road for Norwich Jacobites, and the Whigs organised a notable celebration after the Battle of Culloden.

The events of this period illustrate how Norwich had a strong tradition of popular protest favouring Church and Stuarts and attached to the street and alehouse. Knights tells how in 1716 the mayoral election had ended in a riot, with both sides throwing &quot;brick-ends and great paving stones&quot; at each other. A renowned Jacobite watering-hole, the &quot;Blue Bell Inn&quot; (nowadays &quot;The Bell Hotel&quot;), owned in the early 18th century by the high-church Helwys family, became the central rendezvous of the Norwich Revolution Society in the 1790s.

Britain&#x27;s first provincial newspaper, the &quot;Norwich Post&quot;, appeared in 1701. By 1726 there were rival Whig and Tory presses, and as early as mid-century, three-quarters of the males in some parishes were literate. The Norwich municipal library claims an excellent collection of these newspapers, also a folio collection of scrapbooks on 18th-century Norwich politics, which Knights says are &quot;valuable and important&quot;. Norwich alehouses had 281 clubs and societies meeting in them in 1701, and at least 138 more were formed before 1758. The Theatre Royal opened in 1758, alongside the city&#x27;s stage productions in inns and puppet shows in rowdy alehouses. In 1750 Norwich could boast nine booksellers and after 1780 a &quot;growing number of circulating and subscription libraries&quot;. says: &quot;[All this] made for a lively political culture, in which independence from governmental lines was particularly strong, evident in campaigns against the war with America and for reform... in which trade and the impact of war with Revolutionary France were key ingredients. The open and contestable structure of local government, the press, the clubs and societies, and dissent all ensured that politics overlapped with communities bound by economics, religion, ideology and print in a world in which public opinion could not be ignored.&quot;

Amid this metropolitan culture, the city burghers had built a sophisticated political structure. Freemen, who had the right to trade and to vote at elections, numbered about 2,000 in 1690, rising to over 3,300 by the mid-1730s. With growth partly the result of political manipulation, their numbers did at one point reach one-third of the adult male population. This was notoriously the age of &quot;rotten&quot; and &quot;pocket&quot; boroughs and Norwich was unusual in having such a high proportion of its citizens able to vote. &quot;Of the political centres where the Jacobin propaganda had penetrated most deeply only Norwich and Nottingham had a franchise deep enough to allow radicals to make use of the electoral process.&quot; &quot;Apart from London, Norwich was probably still the largest of those boroughs which were democratically governed,&quot; says , describing other towns under the control of a single fiefdom. In Norwich, he says, a powerful Anglican establishment, symbolised by the Cathedral and the great church of St Peter Mancroft was matched by scarcely less powerful of Dissenters headed by the wealthy literate body [of Unitarians] worshipping at the Octagon Chapel.

In the middle of political disorders of the late 18th century, Norwich intellectual life flourished. Harriet Martineau wrote of the city&#x27;s &quot;literati&quot; of the period, including such people as William Taylor, one of England&#x27;s first scholars of German. The city &quot;boasted of her intellectual supper-parties, where, amidst a pedantry which would now make laughter hold both his sides, there was much that was pleasant and salutary: and finally she called herself &quot;The Athens of England&quot;.&quot;

Despite Norwich&#x27;s longstanding industrial prosperity, by the 1790s its wool trade had begun facing intense competition, at first from Yorkshire woollens and then, increasingly, from Lancashire cotton. The effects were aggravated by the loss of continental markets after Britain went to war with France in 1793. The early 19th century saw de-industrialisation accompanied by bitter squabbles. The 1820s were marked by wage cuts and personal recrimination against owners. So amid the rich commercial and cultural heritage of its recent past, Norwich suffered in the 1790s from incipient decline exacerbated by a serious trade recession.

As early in the war as 1793, a major city manufacturer and government supporter, Robert Harvey, complained of low order books, languid trade and doubling of the poor rate. Like many of their Norwich forebears, the hungry poor took their complaints onto the streets. Hayes describes a meeting of 200 people in a Norwich public house, where &quot;Citizen Stanhope&quot; spoke. The gathering &quot;[roared its] applause at Stanhope&#x27;s declaration that the Ministers unless they changed their policy, deserved to have their heads brought to the block; – and if there was a people still in England, the event might turn out to be so.&quot; Hayes says that &quot;the outbreak of war, in bringing the worsted manufacture almost to a standstill and so plunging the mass of the Norwich weavers into sudden distress made it almost inevitable that a crude appeal to working-class resentment should take the place of a temperate process of education which the earliest reformers had intended.&quot;

At this period opposition to Pitt&#x27;s government and their war came – in their case almost unanimously – from a circle of radical Dissenting intellectuals of interest in their own right. They included the Rigby, Taylor, Aitkin, Barbold, and Alderson families – all Unitarians - and some of the Quaker Gurneys (one of whose girls, Elizabeth, was later, under her married name of Fry, to become a noted campaigner for prison reform). Their activities included visits to revolutionary France (before the execution of Louis XVI), the earliest British research into German literature, studies on medical science, petitioning for parliamentary reform, and publishing a highbrow literary magazine called &quot;The Cabinet&quot;, in 1795. Their blend of politics, religion and social campaigning was seen by Pitt and Windham as suspicious, prompting Pitt to denounce Norwich as &quot;the Jacobin city&quot;. Edmund Burke attacked John Gurney in print for sponsoring anti-war protests. In the 1790s, Norwich was second only to London as an active intellectual centre in England, and that it did not regain that level of prominence until the University of East Anglia was established in the late 20th century.

By 1795, it was not just the Norwich rabble who were causing the government concern. In April of that year, the Norwich Patriotic Society was founded, its manifesto declaring &quot;that the great end of civil society was general happiness; that every individual had a right to share in the government.&quot; In December the price of bread reached a new peak, and in May 1796, when William Windham was forced to seek re-election after his appointment as war secretary, he only just held his seat. Amid the disorder and violence that was such a common feature of Norwich election campaigns, it was only by the narrowest margin that the radical Bartlett Gurney (&quot;Peace and Gurney – No More War – No more Barley Bread&quot;) failed to unseat him.

Though informed by issues of recent national importance, the bipartisan political culture of Norwich in the 1790s cannot be divorced from local tradition. Two features stand out from a political continuum of three centuries. The first is a dichotomous power balance. From at least the time of the Reformation, Norwich was recorded as a &quot;two-party city&quot;. In the mid-16th century, the weaving parishes fell under the control of opposition forces, as Kett&#x27;s rebels held the north of the river, in support of poor clothworkers. Indeed there seems to be a case for saying that with this tradition of two-sided disputation, the city had steadily developed an infrastructure, evident in its many cultural and institutional networks of politics, religion, society, news media and the arts, whereby argument could be managed short of outright confrontation. Indeed, at a time of hunger and tension on the Norwich streets, with alehouse crowds ready to have &quot;a Minister&#x27;s head brought to the block&quot;, the Anglican and Dissenting clergy exerted themselves to conduct a collegial dialogue, seeking common ground and reinforcing the well-mannered civic tradition of earlier periods.

In 1797 Thomas Bignold, a 36-year-old wine merchant and banker founded the first Norwich Union Society. Some years earlier, when he moved from Kent to Norwich, Bignold had been unable to find anyone willing to insure him against the threat from highwaymen. With the entrepreneurial thought that nothing was impossible, and aware that in a city built largely of wood the threat of fire was uppermost in people&#x27;s minds, Bignold formed the &quot;Norwich Union Society for the Insurance of Houses, Stock and Merchandise from Fire&quot;. The new business, which became known as the Norwich Union Fire Insurance Office, was a &quot;mutual&quot; enterprise. Norwich Union would later become the country&#x27;s largest insurance giant.

From earliest times, Norwich was a textile centre. In the 1780s the manufacture of Norwich shawls became an important industry and remained so for nearly a hundred years. The shawls were a high-quality fashion product and rivalled those of other towns such as Paisley, which had entered shawl manufacturing in about 1805, some 20 or more years after Norwich. With changes in women&#x27;s fashion in the later Victorian period, the popularity of shawls declined and eventually manufacture ceased. Examples of Norwich shawls are now sought after by collectors of textiles.

Norwich&#x27;s geographical isolation was such that until 1845, when a railway link was established, it was often quicker to travel to Amsterdam by boat than to London. The railway was introduced to Norwich by Morton Peto, who also built a line to Great Yarmouth. From 1808 to 1814, Norwich had a station in the shutter telegraph chain that connected the Admiralty in London to its naval ships in the port of Great Yarmouth. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of Britannia Barracks in 1897. The Bethel Street and Cattle Market Street drill halls were built around the same time.

===20th century===
In the early 20th century, Norwich still had several major manufacturing industries. Among them were the large-scale and bespoke manufacture of shoes (for example the Start-rite and Van Dal brands, Bowhill &amp; Elliott and Cheney &amp; Sons Ltd respectively), clothing, joinery (including the cabinet makers and furniture retailer Arthur Brett and Sons, which continues in business in the 21st century), structural engineering, and aircraft design and manufacture. Notable employers included Boulton &amp; Paul, Barnards (iron founders and inventors of machine-produced wire netting), and the electrical engineers Laurence Scott and Electromotors.

Norwich also has a long association with chocolate making, mainly through the local firm of Caley&#x27;s, which began as a manufacturer and bottler of mineral water and later diversified into chocolate and Christmas crackers. The Caley&#x27;s cracker-manufacturing business was taken over by Tom Smith in 1953, and the Norwich factory in Salhouse Road closed in 1998. Caley&#x27;s was acquired by Mackintosh in the 1930s and merged with Rowntree&#x27;s in 1969 to become Rowntree-Mackintosh. Finally, it was bought by Nestlé and closed in 1996, with all operations moving to York after a Norwich association of 120 years. The demolished factory stood where the Chapelfield development is now. Caley&#x27;s chocolate has since reappeared as a brand in the city, though it is no longer made there.

HMSO, once the official publishing and stationery arm of the British government and one of the largest print buyers, printers and suppliers of office equipment in the UK, moved most of its operations from London to Norwich in the 1970s. It occupied the purpose-built 1968 Sovereign House building, near Anglia Square, which in 2017 stood empty and due for demolition if a long-postponed redevelopment of Anglia Square went ahead.

Jarrolds, established in 1810, was a nationally well-known printer and publisher. In 2004, after nearly 200 years, the printing and publishing businesses were sold. Today, the company remains privately owned and the Jarrold name is best recognised as being that of Norwich&#x27;s only independent department store. The company is also active in property development in Norwich and has a business training division.

====Pubs and brewing====
The city had a long tradition of brewing. Several large breweries continued into the second half of the 20th century, notably Morgans, Steward &amp; Patteson, Youngs Crawshay and Youngs, Bullard and Son, and the Norwich Brewery. Despite takeovers and consolidation in the 1950s and 1960s, only the Norwich Brewery (owned by Watney Mann and on the site of Morgans) remained by the 1970s. That too closed in 1985 and was then demolished. Only microbreweries remain today.

It was stated by Walter Wicks in his book that Norwich once had &quot;a pub for every day of the year and a church for every Sunday&quot;. This was in fact significantly under the actual amount: the highest number of pubs in the city was in the year 1870, with over 780 beer-houses. A &quot;Drink Map&quot; produced in 1892 by the Norwich and Norfolk Gospel Temperance Union showed 631 pubs in and around the city centre. By 1900, the number had dropped to 441 pubs within the City Walls. The title of a pub for every day of the year survived until 1966, when the Chief Constable informed the Licensing Justices that only 355 licences were still operative, with the number still shrinking: over 25 had closed in the last decade. In 2018, about 100 pubs remained open around the city centre.

====Second World War====

Norwich suffered extensive bomb damage during World War II, affecting large parts of the old city centre and Victorian terrace housing around the centre. Industry and the rail infrastructure also suffered. The heaviest raids occurred on the nights of 27/28 and 29/30 April 1942; as part of the Baedeker raids (so-called because Baedeker&#x27;s series of tourist guides to the British Isles were used to select propaganda-rich targets of cultural and historic significance rather than strategic importance). Lord Haw-Haw made reference to the imminent destruction of Norwich&#x27;s new City Hall (completed in 1938), although in the event it survived unscathed. Significant targets hit included the Morgan&#x27;s Brewery building, Colman&#x27;s Wincarnis works, City Station, the Mackintosh chocolate factory, and shopping areas including St Stephen&#x27;s St and St Benedict&#x27;s St, the site of Bond&#x27;s department store (now John Lewis) and Curl&#x27;s (later Debenhams) department store.

229 citizens were killed in the two Baedeker raids with 1,000 others injured, and 340 by bombing throughout the war — giving Norwich the highest air raid casualties in Eastern England. Out of the 35,000 domestic dwellings in Norwich, 2,000 were destroyed, and another 27,000 suffered some damage. In 1945 the city was also the intended target of a brief V-2 rocket campaign, though all these missed the city itself.

====Post-war redevelopment====
As the war ended, the city council revealed what it had been working on before the war. It was published as a book – &quot;The City of Norwich Plan 1945&quot; or commonly known as &quot;The &#x27;45 Plan&quot; – a grandiose scheme of massive redevelopment which never properly materialised. However, throughout the 1960s to early 1970, the city was completely altered and large areas of Norwich were cleared to make way for modern redevelopment.

In 1960, the inner-city district of Richmond, between Ber Street and King Street, locally known as &quot;the Village on the Hill&quot;, was condemned as slums and many residents were forced to leave by compulsory purchase orders on the old terraces and lanes. The whole borough demolished consisted of some 56 acres of existing streets, including 833 dwellings (612 classed as unfit for human habitation), 42 shops, four offices, 22 public houses and two schools. Communities were moved to high-rise buildings such as Normandie Tower and new housing estates such as Tuckswood, which were being built at the time. A new road, Rouen Road, was developed instead, consisting mainly of light industrial units and council flats. Ber Street, a once historic main road into the city, had its whole eastern side demolished. About this time, the final part of St Peters Street, opposite St Peter Mancroft Church, were demolished along with large Georgian townhouses at the top of Bethel Street, to make way for the new City Library in 1961. This burnt down on 1 August 1994 and was replaced in 2001 by The Forum.

A controversial plan was implemented for Norwich&#x27;s inner ring-road in the late 1960s. In 1931, the city architect Robert Atkinson, referring to the City Wall, remarked that &quot;in almost every position are slum dwellings put up during the last 50 years. It would be a great adventure to clear them all out and open up the road following the wall which has always been a natural highway. Do this, and you will have a wonderful circulating boulevard all around the city and its cost would be comparatively nothing.&quot; To accommodate the road, many more buildings were demolished, including an ancient road junction – Stump Cross. Magdalen Street, Botolph Street, St George&#x27;s Street, Calvert Street and notably Pitt Street, all lined with Tudor and Georgian buildings, were cleared to make way for a fly-over and a Brutalist concrete shopping centre – Anglia Square – as well as office blocks such as an HMSO building, Sovereign House. Other areas affected were Grapes Hill, a once narrow lane lined with 19th-century Georgian cottages, which was cleared and widened into a dual carriageway leading to a roundabout. Shortly before construction of the roundabout, the city&#x27;s old Drill Hall was demolished, along with sections of the original city wall and other large townhouses along the start of Unthank Road (named after the Unthank family, local landowners). 

The roundabout also required the north-west corner of Chapelfield Gardens to be demolished. About a mile of Georgian and Victorian terrace houses along Chapelfield Road and Queens Road, including many houses built into the city walls, was bulldozed in 1964. This included the surrounding district off Vauxhall Street, consisting of swathes of terrace housing that were condemned as slums. This also included the whole West Pottergate district, which contained a mix of 18th and 19th-century cottages and terraced housing, pubs and shops. Post-war housing and maisonettes flats now stand where the Rookery slums once did. Some aspects of The &#x27;45 Plan were put into action, which saw large three-story Edwardian houses in Grove Avenue and Grove Road, and other large properties on Southwell Road, demolished in 1962 to make way for flat-roofed single-story style maisonettes that still stand today. Heigham Hall, a large Victorian manor house off Old Palace Road was also demolished in 1963, to build Dolphin Grove flats, which housed many Norwich families displaced by slum clearance.

Other housing developments in the private and public sector took place after the Second World War, partly to accommodate the growing population of the city and to replace condemned and bomb-damaged areas, such as the Heigham Grove district between Barn Road and Old Palace Road, where some 200 terraced houses, shops and pubs were all flattened. Only St Barnabas church and one public house, The West End Retreat, now remain. Another central street bulldozed during the 1960s was St Stephens Street. It was widened, clearing away many historically significant buildings in the process, firstly for Norwich Union&#x27;s new office blocks and shortly after with new buildings, after it suffered damage during the Baedeker raids. In Surrey Street, several grand six-storey Georgian townhouses were demolished to make way for Norwich Union&#x27;s office. Other notable buildings that were lost were three theatres (the Norwich Hippodrome on St Giles Street, which is now a multi-storey car park, the Grosvenor Rooms and Electric Theatre in Prince of Wales Road) The Norwich Corn Exchange in Exchange Street (built 1861, demolished 1964), the Free Library in Duke Street (built 1857, demolished 1963) and the Great Eastern Hotel, which faced Norwich Station. Two large churches, the Chapel Field East Congregational church (built 1858, demolished 1972) was pulled down, as well as the tall Presbyterian church in Theatre Street, built in 1874 and designed by local architect Edward Boardman. It has been said that more of Norwich&#x27;s architecture was destroyed by the council in post-war redevelopment schemes than during the Second World War.

====Other events====
In 1976 the city&#x27;s pioneering spirit was on show when Motum Road in Norwich, allegedly the scene of &quot;a number of accidents over the years&quot;, became the third road in Britain to be equipped with sleeping policemen, intended to encourage adherence to the road&#x27;s speed limit. The bumps, installed at intervals of , stretched across the width of the road and their curved profile was, at its highest point, high. The responsible quango gave an assurance that the experimental devices would be removed not more than one year after installation.

From 1980 to 1985 the city became a frequent focus of national media due to squatting in Argyle Street, a Victorian street that was demolished in 1986, despite being the last street to survive the Richmond Hill redevelopment. On 23 November 1981, a minor F0/T1 tornado struck Norwich as part of a record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak, causing minor damage in Norwich city centre and surrounding suburbs.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Norwich, at district and county level: Norwich City Council and Norfolk County Council. The city council manages services such as housing, planning, leisure and tourism, and is based at City Hall overlooking Norwich Market in the city centre. The county council manages services such as schools, transport, social services and libraries across Norfolk. There are no civil parishes in Norwich, with the whole city being an unparished area.

===Lord mayoralty and shrievalty===

The ceremonial head of the city is the Lord Mayor; though now simply a ceremonial position, in the past the office carried considerable authority, with executive powers over the finances and affairs of the city council. The office of Mayor of Norwich dates from 1403 and was raised to the dignity of lord mayor in 1910 by Edward VII &quot;in view of the position occupied by that city as the chief city of East Anglia and of its close association with His Majesty&quot;. The title was regranted on local government reorganisation in 1974. From 1404 the citizens of Norwich, as a county corporate, had the privilege of electing two sheriffs. Under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 this was reduced to one and became a ceremonial post. Both Lord Mayor and Sheriff are elected for a year&#x27;s term of office at the council&#x27;s annual meeting, but the term of office was temporarily extended to two years for the periods 2019-2021 and 2021-2023, the normal annual elections having been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the years 2020-2022.

===Westminster===

Since 1298 Norwich has returned two members of Parliament to the House of Commons. Until 1950 the city was an undivided constituency, returning two MPs. Since that date, the area has been two single-member constituencies: Norwich North and Norwich South. Both proved to be marginal seats in recent elections until 2010, switching between the Labour and Conservative parties.

Norwich North, which includes some rural wards of Broadland District, was held by Labour from 1950 to 1983 when it was gained by the Conservatives. Labour regained the seat in 1997, holding it until a by-election in 2009. The current MP is the Conservative, Chloe Smith, who held the seat in the 2015 General Election. Norwich South, which includes part of South Norfolk District, was held by Labour from February 1974 to 1983, when it was gained by the Conservatives. John Garrett regained the seat for Labour in 1987. Charles Clarke became Labour MP for Norwich South in 1997. In the 2010 General Election, Labour lost the seat to the Liberal Democrats, with Simon Wright becoming MP. At the 2015 General Election, Clive Lewis regained the seat for Labour. In both the 2017 General Election and 2019 General Election, the two incumbent 2015 MPs held their seats.

==Demography==


The 2021 United Kingdom census reported a resident population for the City of Norwich of approximately 144,000, a 8.7 per cent increase over the 2011 census. The urban, built-up area of Norwich had a population of 213,166 according to the 2011 census. This area extends beyond the city boundary, with extensive suburban areas on the western, northern and eastern sides, including Costessey, Taverham, Hellesdon, Bowthorpe, Old Catton, Sprowston and Thorpe St Andrew. The parliamentary seats cross over into adjacent local-government districts. The population of the Norwich travel to work area (i. e. the self-contained labour-market area in and around Norwich in which most people live and commute to work) was estimated at 282,000 in 2009. Norwich is one of the most densely populated local-government districts in the East of England, with .

In 2022 the ethnic composition of Norwich&#x27;s population was 87.1% White, 5.5% Asian, 3.2% of mixed race, 2.6% Black, 0.6% Arab and 1.1% of other ethnic heritage. In religion, 33.6% of the population are Christian, 3% Muslim, 1.2% Hindu, 0.7% Buddhist, 0.2% Jewish, 0.1% Sikh, 0.9% of another religion, 53.5% with no religion and 6.8% unwilling to state their religion. In the 2001 and 2011 censuses, Norwich was found to be the least religious city in England, with the highest proportion of respondents with no reported religion, compared to 25.1% across England and Wales. The largest quinary group consists of the 20 to 24-year-olds (14.6%) because of the high university student population.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary===
The city has 56 primary schools (including 16 academies and free schools) and 13 secondary schools, 11 of which are academies. The city&#x27;s eight independent schools include Norwich School and Norwich High School for Girls. There are five schools for children with learning disabilities. The former Norwich High School for Boys in Upper St Giles Street has a blue plaque commemorating Sir John Mills, who was a pupil there.

===Universities and colleges===
Norwich has two universities: the University of East Anglia and Norwich University of the Arts. The student population is around 15,000, many of them from overseas. The University of East Anglia, founded in 1963, is located on the outskirts of the city. It has a creative writing programme, established by Malcolm Bradbury and Angus Wilson, whose graduates include Kazuo Ishiguro and Ian McEwan. It has done work on climate research and climate change. Its campus is home to the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, which houses several important art collections. The Norwich University of the Arts dates back to 1845 as the Norwich School of Design. Founded by artists and followers of the Norwich School art movement, it was founded to provide designers for local industries. Previously a specialist art school (the Norwich School of Art and Design), it achieved university status in 2013.

Norwich has three further education colleges. City College Norwich, situated on Ipswich Road, was founded in 1891 and is one of the largest such colleges in the country. Access to Music is located on Magdalen Street at Epic Studios, and Easton &amp; Otley College&#x27;s Easton Campus is located west of the city.

==Culture and attractions==
Historically Norwich has been associated with art, literature and publishing. This continues. It was the site of England&#x27;s first provincial library, which opened in 1608, and the first city to implement the Public Libraries Act 1850. The &quot;Norwich Post&quot; was the first provincial newspaper outside London, founded in 1701. The Norwich School of artists was the first provincial art movement, with nationally acclaimed artists such as John Crome associated with the movement. Other literary firsts include Julian of Norwich&#x27;s &quot;Revelations of Divine Love&quot;, published in 1395, which was the first book written in the English language by a woman, and the first poem written in blank verse, composed by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, in the 16th century.

Today the city is a regional centre for publishing, with 5 per cent of the UK&#x27;s independent publishing sector based in the city in 2012. In 2006 Norwich became the UK&#x27;s first City of Refuge, part of the International Cities of Refuge Network (ICORN) which promotes free speech. Norwich made the shortlist for the first city to be designated UK City of Culture, but in July 2010 it was announced that Derry had been selected. In May 2012 Norwich was designated as England&#x27;s first UNESCO City of Literature.

===Attractions===
Norwich is a popular destination for a city break. Attractions include Norwich Cathedral, the cobbled streets and museums of old Norwich, Norwich Castle, Cow Tower, Dragon Hall and The Forum. Norwich is one of the UK&#x27;s top ten shopping destinations, with a mix of chain retailers and independent stores, and Norwich Market as one of the largest outdoor markets in England.

The Forum, designed by Michael Hopkins and Partners and opened in 2002 is a building designed to house the Norfolk and Norwich Millennium Library, a replacement for the Norwich Central Library building which burnt down in 1994, and the regional headquarters and television centre for BBC East. In 2006–2013 it was the most visited library in the UK, with 1.3 million visits in 2013. The collections contains the 2nd Air Division Memorial Library, a collection of material about American culture and the American relationship with East Anglia, especially the role of the United States Air Force on UK airbases throughout the Second World War and Cold War. Much of the collection was lost in the 1994 fire, but the collection has been restored by contributions from many veterans of the war, European and American. The building also provides a venue for art exhibitions, concerts and events, although the city still lacks a dedicated concert venue.

Recent attempts to shed the backwater image of Norwich and market it as a popular tourist destination, as well as a centre for science, commerce, culture and the arts, have included refurbishment of the Norwich Castle Museum and the opening of the Forum. The proposed new slogan for Norwich as &quot;England&#x27;s Other City&quot; has been the subject of much discussion and controversy. It remains to be seen whether it will be adopted. Several signs at the city&#x27;s approaches still display the traditional phrase: &quot;Norwich — a fine city&quot;.

The city promotes its architectural heritage through a collection of notable buildings in Norwich called the &quot;Norwich 12&quot;. The group consists of: Norwich Castle, Norwich Cathedral, the Great Hospital, St Andrew&#x27;s Hall and Blackfriars&#x27; Hall, The Guildhall, Dragon Hall, The Assembly House, St James Mill, St John the Baptist RC Cathedral, Surrey House, City Hall and The Forum.

===Art and music===
Each year the Norfolk and Norwich Festival celebrates the arts, drawing many visitors into the city from all over eastern England. The Norwich Twenty Group, founded in 1944, presents exhibitions of its members to promote awareness of modern art. Norwich was home to the first arts festival in Britain in 1772.

Norwich Arts Centre is a notable live music venue, concert hall and theatre located in St Benedict&#x27;s Street. The King of Hearts in Fye Bridge Street is another centre for art and music. Norwich has a thriving music scene based around local venues such as the University of East Anglia LCR, Norwich Arts Centre, The Waterfront and Epic Studios. Live music, mostly contemporary musical genres, is also to be heard at a number of other public house and club venues around the city. The city is host to many artists that have achieved national and international recognition such as Cord, The Kabeedies, Serious Drinking, Tim Bowness, Sennen, Magoo, Let&#x27;s Eat Grandma and KaitO.

Norwich hosted BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend in 2015. The event was held on 23–24 May in Earlham Park.

Established record labels in Norwich include All Sorted Records, NR ONE, Hungry Audio and Burning Shed.

The British artist Stella Vine lived in Norwich from the age of seven, including for a short while in Argyle Street, Norwich and again later in life with her son Jamie. Vine depicted the city in a large painting, &quot;Welcome to Norwich a fine city&quot; (2006).

===Theatres===


Norwich has theatres ranging in capacity from 100 to 1,300 seats and offering a wide variety of programmes. The Theatre Royal is the largest and has been on its present site for nearly 250 years, through several rebuildings and many alterations. It has 1,300 seats and hosts a mix of national touring productions including musicals, dance, drama, family shows, stand-up comedians, opera and pop.

The Maddermarket Theatre opened in 1921 as the first permanent recreation of an Elizabethan theatre. The founder was Nugent Monck who had worked with William Poel. The theatre is a Shakespearean-style playhouse and has a seating capacity of 310. Norwich Puppet Theatre was founded in 1979 by Ray and Joan DaSilva as a permanent base for their touring company and was first opened as a public venue in 1980, following the conversion of the medieval church of St James in the heart of Norwich. Under subsequent artistic directors — Barry Smith and Luis Z. Boy — the theatre established its current pattern of operation. It is a nationally unique venue dedicated to puppetry, and currently houses a 185-seat raked auditorium, the 50-seat Octagon Studio, workshops, an exhibition gallery, shop and licensed bar. It is the only theatre in the Eastern region with a year-round programme of family-centred entertainment. Norwich Arts Centre theatre opened in 1977 in St Benedict&#x27;s Street and has a capacity of 290. The Norwich Playhouse, which opened in 1995 and has a seating capacity of 300, is a venue in the heart of the city and one of the most modern performance spaces of its size in East Anglia.

The Garage studio theatre seats up to 110 in a range of layouts, or can be used for standing events for up to 180. Platform Theatre is in the grounds of the City College Norwich. Productions are staged mainly in the autumn and summer months. The theatre is raked and seats about 250. On 20 April 2012, it held a large relaunch event with an evening performance, showcasing it with previews of coming performances and scenes from past ones.

The Whiffler Theatre, built in 1981, was given to the people of Norwich by the local newspaper group Eastern Daily Press. It is an open-air facility in Norwich Castle Gardens, with fixed-raked seating for up to 80 and standing for another 30 on the balcony. The stage is brick-built and has its dressing rooms set in a small building to stage left. The Whiffler mainly plays small Shakespeare productions. Sewell Barn Theatre is the smallest theatre in Norwich and has a seating capacity of just 100. The auditorium features raked seating on three sides of an open acting space. This staging helps to draw the audience closer into the performance.

Public performance spaces include the Forum in the city centre, with a large open-air amphitheatre for performances of many types throughout the year. Additionally, the cloisters of Norwich Cathedral are used for open-air performances as part of an annual Shakespeare festival.

===Museums===
Norwich has several museums to reflect the history of the city and of Norfolk, and wider interests. The largest, Norwich Castle Museum, has extensive collections of archaeological finds from Norfolk, art (including a fine collection of paintings by the Norwich School of painters), ceramics (including the largest collection of British teapots), silver, and natural history. Of particular interest are dioramas of Norfolk scenery showing wildlife and landscape. It has been much remodelled to enhance the display of the collections and hosts frequent temporary exhibitions of art and other subjects.

The Museum of Norwich at the Bridewell (until 2014 the Bridewell Museum) closed in 2010 for refurbishment of the building and overhaul of the displays, and re-opened in July 2012. The several galleries and groups of displays include &quot;Life in Norwich: Our City 1900–1945&quot;; &quot;Life in Norwich: Our City 1945 Onwards&quot;; and &quot;England&#x27;s Second City&quot; depicting Norwich in the 18th century. &quot;Made in Norwich&quot;, &quot;Industrious City&quot; and &quot;Shoemakers&quot; have exhibits connected with historic industries of Norwich, including weaving, shoe and bootmaking, iron foundries, and manufacture of metal goods, engineering, milling, brewing, chocolate-making and other food manufacturing. &quot;Shopping and Trading&quot; extends from the early 19th century to the 1960s.

Strangers&#x27; Hall, at Charing Cross, is one of the oldest buildings in Norwich: a merchant&#x27;s house from the early 14th century. The many rooms are furnished and equipped in the styles of different eras, from the Early Tudor to the Late Victorian. Exhibits include costumes and textiles, domestic objects, children&#x27;s toys and games and children&#x27;s books. The last two collections are seen to be of national importance.

The Royal Norfolk Regimental Museum was, until 2011, housed in part of the former Shirehall, close to the castle. Although archives and the reserve collections are still held in the Shirehall, the principal museum display there closed in September 2011 and was relocated to the main Norwich Castle Museum, reopening fully in 2013. It illustrates the history of the regiment from its 17th-century origins to its incorporation into the Royal Anglian Regiment in 1964, along with many aspects of its military life. There is an extensive, representative display of medals awarded to soldiers of the regiment, including two of the six Victoria Crosses won.

The City of Norwich Aviation Museum is at Horsham St Faith, on the northern edge of the city, close to Norwich Airport. It has static displays of military and civil aircraft, with various collective exhibits, including one for the United States 8th Army Air Force.

Formerly known as the John Jarrold Printing Museum, The Norwich Printing Museum covers the history of printing, with examples of printing machinery, presses, books and related equipment considered of national and international importance. Exhibits date from the early 19th century to the present day. Some machinery and equipment are shown in use. Many items were donated by Jarrold Printing. In November 2018, redevelopment plans for the museum site at Whitefriars caused uncertainty about its future. The museum closed its Whitefriars premises on 23 October 2019, with a plan to relocate to the vacant medieval church of St Peter Parmentergate in King Street in 2020, but this site was later found to be unsuitable. In 2021, the museum trustees were offered space at Blickling Hall, near Aylsham, and, as &quot;The Norwich Printing Museum&quot;, it reopened there as a fully-working museum in July 2021. Whilst the museum continues in its temporary home at Blickling, as at March 2023 the trustees were seeking permanent quarters in Norwich. At October 2024, the search for a permanent home has continued, and the museum will be leaving its temporary home at Blickling in October 2025; by which time the trustees hope to have found a new home, preferably in Norwich.

Dragon Hall in King Street exemplifies a medieval merchants&#x27; trading hall. Mostly dating from about 1430, it is unique in Western Europe. In 2006 the building underwent restoration. Its architecture is complemented by displays on the history of the building and its role in Norwich through the ages. The Norwich Castle Study Centre at the Shirehall in Market Avenue has some important collections, including one of more than 20,000 costume and textile items built up over some 130 years and previously kept in other Norwich museums. Although not a publicly open museum in the usual sense, items are accessible to the public, students and researchers by prior appointment.

===Entertainment===
Norwich has three cinema complexes. Odeon Norwich is located in the Riverside Leisure Centre, Vue inside the Castle Mall and previously the Hollywood Cinema (closed 2019) at Anglia Square, north of the city centre. Cinema City is an art-house cinema showing non-mainstream productions, operated by Picturehouse in St Andrews Street opposite St Andrew&#x27;s Hall, whose patron was actor John Hurt. Norwich has a large number of pubs throughout the city. Prince of Wales Road in the city centre, running from the Riverside district near Norwich railway station to Norwich Castle, is home to many of them, along with bars and clubs.

===Media and film===
Norwich is the headquarters of BBC East, its presence in the East of England, and BBC Radio Norfolk, &quot;BBC Look East&quot;, &quot;Inside Out&quot; and &quot;The Politics Show&quot; are broadcast from studios in The Forum. Independent radio stations based in Norwich include Heart East, Smooth East Anglia, Greatest Hits Radio Norfolk and North Suffolk, and the University of East Anglia&#x27;s Livewire 1350, an online station. A community station, Future Radio, was launched on 6 August 2007.

ITV Anglia, formerly Anglia Television, is based in Norwich. Although one of the smaller ITV companies, it supplied the network with some of its most popular shows such as &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;, &quot;Survival&quot; and &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; (1971–1983), which began each edition with John Benson&#x27;s enthusiastic announcement: &quot;And now from Norwich, it&#x27;s the quiz of the week!&quot; The company also had a subsidiary called Anglia Multimedia, which produced educational content on CD and DVD mainly for schools, and was one of the three companies, along with Granada TV and the BBC vying for the right to produce a digital television station for English schools and colleges.

Launched in 1959, Anglia Television lost its independence in 1994 with a takeover by Meridian Broadcasting. Subsequent mergers have seen it reduced from a significant producer of programmes to a regional news centre. The company is still based in Anglia House, the former Norfolk and Norwich Agricultural Hall, on Agricultural Hall Plain near Prince of Wales Road.

Despite the contraction of Anglia, television production in Norwich has by no means ended. Anglia&#x27;s former network production centre at Magdalen Street has been taken over by Norfolk County Council and revamped. After a total investment of £4 million from the East of England Development Agency (EEDA) it has re-opened as Epic Studios (East of England Production Innovation Centre). Degree courses in film and video are run at the centre by Norwich University of the Arts. Epic has commercial, broadcast-quality post-production facilities, a real-time virtual studio and a smaller HD discussion studio. The main studio opened as an HD facility in November 2008, when it began concentrating on the development of new TV formats and has worked on pilot shows.

Archant publishes two dailies in Norwich, the &quot;Norwich Evening News&quot; and the regional &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot; (EDP). It had its own television operation, Mustard TV, which closed after being bought out by the That&#x27;s TV group. Mustard TV is now That&#x27;s Norfolk.

The character of Alan Partridge in the sitcom &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; (1997–2002) and the comedy film &quot;Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa&quot; (2013) is a Norwich broadcaster played by Steve Coogan.

===Esoteric associations===
Because Norwich was England&#x27;s second city in the medieval and Renaissance periods, it has some little acknowledged, but significant associations with esoteric spirituality. It was the home of William Cuningham, a physician who published &quot;An Invective Epistle in Defense of Astrologers&quot; in 1560. The Elizabethan dramatist Robert Greene, author of Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay, was born in Norwich in 1558. The city was the retirement residence of Arthur Dee (died Norwich, 1651), eldest son of the alchemist John Dee.

Norwich was the residence of the physician and hermetic philosopher Sir Thomas Browne, author of &quot;The Garden of Cyrus&quot; (1658). Many influential esoteric titles are listed as once in Browne&#x27;s library. His coffin-plate, on display at the church of St Peter Mancroft, alludes to Paracelsian medicine and alchemy. Translated from Latin it reads, &quot;Great Virtues, ...sleeping here the dust of his spagyric body converts the lead to gold.&quot; Browne was also a significant figure in the history of physiognomy.

The Church of St John Maddermarket&#x27;s graveyard includes the Crabtree headstone, which has the pre-Christian symbol of the Ouroboros along with Masonic Square and Compasses carved upon it. Within the church is the Layer Monument, a rare example of an alchemical mandala in European funerary art.

From 1787 the congregation of the New Jerusalem Church of Swedenborgians, followers of the mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, worshipped at the Church of St Mary the Less; in 1852 they moved to Park Lane, Norwich to establish the Swedenborgian Chapel.

==Architecture==

Norwich&#x27;s medieval period is represented by the 11th-century Norwich Cathedral, 12th-century castle (now a museum) and several parish churches, including the 15th-century Saint James the Less, Pockthorpe, which survived the bombing in World War II. In the Middle Ages, 57 churches stood within the city wall; 31 still exist and seven are still used for worship. There was a common regional saying that it had a church for every week of the year and a pub for every day. Norwich is said to have more standing medieval churches than any city north of the Alps. The &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; is believed to be the oldest pub in the city, with the earliest known reference made in 1249. Most medieval buildings are in the city centre. Notable secular examples are Dragon Hall, built about 1430, and The Guildhall, built in 1407–1413 with later additions. From the 18th century, the pre-eminent local name is Thomas Ivory, who built the Assembly Rooms (1776), the Octagon Chapel (1756), St Helen&#x27;s House (1752) in the grounds of the Great Hospital, and innovative speculative housing in Surrey Street (). Ivory should not be confused with the Irish architect of the same name and a similar period.

The 19th century saw an explosion in Norwich&#x27;s size and much of its housing stock, as well as commercial building in the city centre. The local architect of the Victorian and Edwardian periods who continues to command most respect was George Skipper (1856–1948). Examples of his work include the Norwich Union headquarters in Surrey Street the Modern Style (British Art Nouveau style) Royal Arcade, and the Hotel de Paris in the nearby seaside town of Cromer. The neo-Gothic Roman Catholic St John the Baptist Cathedral in Earlham Road was begun in 1882 by George Gilbert Scott Junior and his brother, John Oldrid Scott. George Skipper had great influence on the appearance of the city. John Betjeman compared it to Gaudi&#x27;s influence on Barcelona.

The city continued to grow through the 20th century. Much housing, particularly in areas further from the city centre, dates from that century. The first notable building since Skipper was the City Hall by C. H. James and S. R. Pierce, opened in 1938. At the same time they moved the City War Memorial, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, to a memorial garden between the city hall and the market place. Bombing during the Second World War, resulting in relatively little loss of life, caused marked damage to the housing stock in the city centre. Much of the post-war replacement stock was designed by the local-authority architect, David Percival. However, the major post-war architectural development in Norwich was the opening of the University of East Anglia in 1964. Originally designed by Denys Lasdun (his design was never completely executed), it has been added to over subsequent decades by major names such as Norman Foster and Rick Mather.
===Parks, gardens and open spaces===

&quot;See also List of parks, gardens and open spaces in Norwich&quot;

Chapelfield Gardens in central Norwich became the city&#x27;s first public park in November 1880. From the start of the 20th century, Norwich Corporation began buying and leasing land to develop parks when funds became available. Sewell Park and James Stuart Gardens are examples of land donated by benefactors.

After the First World War the Corporation applied government grants to lay out a series of formal parks as a means to alleviate unemployment. Under Parks Superintendent Captain Sandys-Winsch, Heigham Park was completed in 1924, Wensum Park in 1925, Eaton Park in 1928 and Waterloo Park in 1933. These retain many features from Sandys-Winsch&#x27;s plans and have joined the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest.

As of 2015, the city has 23 parks, 95 open spaces and 59 natural areas managed by the local authority. In addition there are several private gardens occasionally opened to the public in aid of charity. The Plantation Garden, also private, opens daily.

==Sport==
The principal local football club is Norwich City, known as the &quot;Canaries&quot;. In 2020–21 it finished first in the second tier of English football, the Championship, earning promotion to the Premier League for 2021–22. Majority-owned by celebrity chef Delia Smith and her husband Michael Wynn-Jones, its ground is Carrow Road Stadium. It has strong East Anglian rivalry with Ipswich Town. The club has enjoyed much success in the past, having played in the top division regularly since 1972, its longest spell being a nine-year run from 1986 to 1995. It has won two Football League Cups, and finished third in the inaugural Premier League in 1993. The club was relegated two years later and did not reclaim its place for nine years, going down again after just one season, only to return in 2011 after two successive promotions.

In 1993, the club eliminated German giants Bayern Munich from the UEFA Cup, in what is to date Norwich City&#x27;s only season in European competitions; it had qualified for the UEFA Cup three times between 1985 and 1989 but been unable to compete as there was a ban on English clubs in European competitions at the time. Before emerging as a top division club, it famously eliminated Manchester United from the FA Cup in 1959 and went on to reach the semi-finals of the domestic cup competition, a run it achieved again in 1989 and most recently in 1992. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the club produced some highly-rated talent of that era, including striker Chris Sutton, winger Ruel Fox, defender Andy Linighan, midfielder Mike Phelan, midfielder Tim Sherwood and striker Justin Fashanu. The club&#x27;s successful managers have included Ken Brown, Ron Saunders, Dave Stringer, Mike Walker, Nigel Worthington, Paul Lambert and Daniel Farke.

Norwich City Women play in the Women&#x27;s National League Division One South East, the fourth tier of women&#x27;s football. They play their home games at The Nest and were formally integrated into Norwich City F.C. in 2022. The original Norwich City Ladies won the Women&#x27;s FA Cup in 1986, beating Doncaster Belles 4-3 in the final with Linda Curl, Miranda Colk, Sallie Jackson and Marianne Lawrence scoring the goals.

The city&#x27;s second men&#x27;s club, Norwich United, is based in Blofield some east of the city. Along with Norwich CBS, it plays in the Eastern Counties League. The now-defunct Gothic was also based in Norwich. Local football clubs are served by the Norwich and District Saturday Football League.

Norwich has an athletics club, City of Norwich AC (CoNAC), a rugby club, the Norwich Lions, a handball Club, Norwich HC, and five field hockey clubs. In the 2012–2013 season, the club playing at the highest level on the men&#x27;s side was Norwich City Hockey Club in the East Hockey Premier B, which is two levels below the National League. The second highest is Norwich Dragons in Division Two North, then the students only University of East Anglia Men&#x27;s Hockey Club in Division Three North East, then Norfolk Nomads Men&#x27;s Hockey Club in Division Six North East. On the Ladies&#x27; side of the game, both Norwich City Hockey Club and Norwich Dragons Hockey club play in East Hockey&#x27;s Division One North, two levels below National League. Following them, the students from the University of East Anglia Women&#x27;s Hockey Club play in the Norfolk Premier Division. Also in Norwich, there is a veterans-only side, Norwich Exiles.

Since 2015, Norwich has hosted an annual 10k athletics road race, Run Norwich.

Outside the city boundary, the dry ski and snowboarding slopes of Norfolk Ski Club are located at Whitlingham Lane in Trowse. Close by in the parish of Whitlingham is Whitlingham Country Park, home to the Outdoor Education Centre. The centre is based on the south bank of the Great Broad which is also used by scuba divers from one of the city&#x27;s three diving schools, and by other water and land sports.

Of Norwich&#x27;s two main rowing clubs, the Yare Boat Club is the older but smaller of the two. It is based on an island on the River Yare accessed from beside the &quot;Rivergarden&quot; pub in Thorpe Road. The larger Norwich Rowing Club, in partnership with Norwich Canoe Club, UEA Boat Club, Norwich School Boat Club and Norwich High School Rowing Club, has built a boathouse alongside Whitlingham Little Broad and the River Yare. Norwich Canoe Club specialises in sprint and marathon racing. It holds the highest British Canoe Union Top Club Gold accreditation, and is one of the more successful clubs in the UK. Ian Wynne, 2004 Olympics K1 500m bronze medallist, is an honorary member.

Speedway racing was staged in Norwich before and after World War II at The Firs Stadium in Holt Road, Hellesdon. The Norwich Stars raced in the Northern League of 1946 and the National League Division Two between 1947 and 1951, winning it in 1951. They were later elevated to the National League and raced at the top flight until the stadium was closed at the end of the 1964 season. One meet was staged at a venue at Hevingham, but without an official permit, and it did not lead to a revival of the sport in the Norwich area.

In boxing, Norwich can boast former European and British lightweight champion Jon Thaxton, reigning English light heavyweight champion Danny McIntosh and heavyweight Sam Sexton, a former winner of the Prizefighter tournament. Based in Norwich, Herbie Hide has been WBO Heavyweight World Champion twice, winning the championship in 1994–95 and for a second time in 1997.

Norwich has a UK baseball team, the Norwich Iceni, which competes at the Single-A level of the BBF. It was founded in 2015 with players from the UEA Blue Sox, who wished to carry on playing after university. The team officially joined the league in 2017 and was crowned BBF Single-A champions in its first season, going undefeated with 17 wins.

==Statistics==
Norwich was the second city of England after London for several centuries before industrialisation, which came late to Norwich due to its isolation and lack of raw materials.

In November 2006 the city was voted the greenest in the UK. There is currently an initiative to make it a transition town. Norwich has been the scene of open discussions in public spaces, known as &quot;meet in the street&quot;, to cover social and political issues.

Articles in the past suggested that compared with other UK cities, Norwich was top of the league by percentage of population among who use the popular Internet auction site eBay. The city also unveiled the then-biggest free Wi-Fi network in the UK in July 2006.

In August 2007 Norwich was listed among nine finalists in its population group for the International Awards for Liveable Communities. The city eventually won a silver award in the small-city category.

==Economy and infrastructure==
Norwich&#x27;s economy was historically manufacturing-based, including a large shoemaking industry, but it transitioned in the 1980s and 1990s into a service-based economy.

The greater-Norwich economy (including Norwich, Broadland and South Norfolk government districts) as measured by GVA was estimated at £7.4 billion in 2011 (2011 GVA at 2006 prices). The city&#x27;s largest employment sectors are business and financial services (31%), public services (26%), retail (12%), manufacturing (8%) and tourism (7%).

The proportion of working-age adults in Norwich claiming unemployment benefits is 3.3% compared with 3.6% across the UK.

New developments on the former Boulton and Paul site include a Riverside entertainment complex with nightclubs and other venues featuring the usual national leisure brands. Nearby, the football stadium is being upgraded with more residential property development alongside the River Wensum.

Archant, formerly Eastern Counties Newspapers (ECN), is a national publishing group that has grown out of the city&#x27;s local newspapers and is headquartered in Norwich.

Norwich has long been associated with the making of mustard. The world-famous Colman&#x27;s brand, with its yellow packaging, was founded in 1814 and operated from a factory at Carrow, latterly owned by Unilever. This site closed in 2019, with mustard now being made by Condimentum at Honingham, in a supply deal with Unilever. Colman&#x27;s is exported worldwide, putting Norwich on the map of British heritage brands. The Colman&#x27;s Mustard Shop, which sold Colman&#x27;s products and related gifts, was until 2017 located in the Royal Arcade in the centre of Norwich but closed in that year.

Situated to the south-west of the city is the Norwich Research Park, a community of research organisations, including the Institute of Food Research and the John Innes Centre, and over 30 science and technology-based businesses, the University of East Anglia and the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.

Norwich&#x27;s night-time economy of bars and night clubs is mainly located in Tombland, Prince of Wales Road and the Riverside area adjacent to Norwich railway station.

Norwich&#x27;s location in a mainly-agricultural county provided opportunities for the supply of services to that industry. Prior to 1960, a large area below the Castle Mound was given over to Norwich Livestock Market. In that year, the Livestock Market moved from the centre of the city to a new site at Harford and, although now diminished in size, it continues to hold regular auctions of poultry, cattle, sheep and farm machinery.

===Retail===
Norwich was the eighth most prosperous shopping destination in the UK in 2006. It has an ancient marketplace established by the Normans in 1071–1074, which is today the largest six-day-a-week open-air market in England. In 2006, the market was downsized and redeveloped; the new market stalls have proved controversial: with 20% less floor space than the originals, higher rental and other charges, and inadequate rainwater handling, which has been unpopular with many stallholders and customers. In 2007 the local &quot;Norwich Evening News&quot; called Norwich Market an ongoing conflict between market traders and its operator, Norwich City Council.

The Castle Quarter, a shopping centre designed by the local practice Lambert, Scott &amp; Innes and opened in 1993, presents an ingenious solution to the problem of accommodating retail space in a historic city-centre environment — the building is largely concealed underground and built into the side of a hill, with a public park created on its roof in the area south of the castle.

A second shopping centre, Chantry Place (formally Chapelfield) was opened in 2005 on the site of a closed Caley&#x27;s (later Rowntree Mackintosh and Nestlé) chocolate factory, featuring as its flagship department store House of Fraser. Following a change of ownership in 2020, it was renamed Chantry Place. Detractors have criticised the centre as unnecessary and damaging to local businesses, prompting smaller retailers to band together to promote their virtues. Despite this, in August 2006 it was reported by the Javelin Group that Norwich was one of the top five retail destinations in the UK, and in October 2006 the city centre was voted best in the UK in a shopping satisfaction survey run by Goldfish Credit Card.

A section of central Norwich roughly bounded by Bethel Street/Upper St Giles Street, Grapes Hill, St Benedict&#x27;s and St Andrew&#x27;s Hill/London Street/Castle Meadow is now known and promoted as Norwich Lanes. As a series of mostly pedestrianised lanes, alleyways and streets, it is noted for independent retailers and eating and drinking establishments. It also contains several of the city&#x27;s cultural attractions, including museums, theatres and other venues. Norwich Lanes, as part of a nationwide drive to recognise the importance and maintain the character and individuality of Britain&#x27;s high streets, was the Great British High Street Awards 2014 national winner in the &quot;City&quot; category.

To the north is Anglia Square shopping centre. The owners of the site want it redeveloped; demolition work was due to start in 2010 after an archaeological dig, conducted in 2009 and due to the centre being located around the site of a Saxon fortified settlement. The Twentieth Century Society has objected to demolish on the ground of the architectural merits of one of the few Brutalists shopping centres left in the UK and the 35,900 tonnes of embodied carbon. The development is planned to be a mix of shops and housing, unlike the original offices, shops and cinema. In February 2009, an initial delay to the plans was blamed on the economic climate, and developers were unable to say when work would begin. Further delays occurred in the years following. In 2014, it was bought by investment manager Threadneedle Investments for £7.5 million. The owners and their partner Weston Homes announced in November 2016 they had been holding talks with chief officers at Norwich City Hall. Plans submitted included demolishing Anglia Square, the former stationery office and Gildengate House. Over a thousand homes were planned above shop units and a public square. In early 2018, Weston Homes and landowner Columbia Threadneedle submitted regeneration plans to include 1,200 homes, a 20-storey tower block, a supermarket, a hotel, green squares and central courtyards. The controversial 2018 plans were rejected by the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government in 2020, and in 2021 the developer resubmitted revised plans.

===Electricity supply===
Temporary electric street lighting in Norwich started in 1882. The first permanent supply came in 1893 from a generating station in Duke Street. This supplied local industry and domestic users and from 1900 the Norwich Electric Tramways. In the late 1920s, a new 40 MW power station was built at Thorpe, to which was added in 1937 30 MW &quot;high pressure&quot; generating plant. These operated until 1975. A gas turbine plant was installed in 1964 to provide power at times of peak demand. This closed in 1986 and the entire Thorpe power station site was demolished and cleared in 1981–1982. Two tall electricity pylons stood near the site until they were dismantled in 2017. Further details appear in Norwich power stations.

==Transport==
===Railway===
Norwich railway station is sited in the east of the city centre and is managed by Greater Anglia, which also operates most passenger services.

It is the northern terminus of the Great Eastern Main Line. There are half-hourly inter-city services to London Liverpool Street, via Ipswich, Colchester and Chelmsford.

Hourly regional services to Cambridge, and out of Norwich as far as Ely, are run along the Breckland Line. There are also hourly local services to Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft (using the Wherry Lines) and to Sheringham (using the Bittern Line).

East Midlands Railway operate a direct route to the Midlands and North West England, with hourly services to Liverpool Lime Street calling at Peterborough, Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester Piccadilly.

Norwich is the site of Crown Point TMD, a depot that maintains the trains used in the area.

===Road===
Norwich lies north of the A47 (bypassed to the south of the city), which connects it with Great Yarmouth to the east, and King&#x27;s Lynn and Peterborough to the west. There are plans to upgrade the A47, especially sections that are still single-carriageway, prompted partly by ongoing construction of Great Yarmouth Outer Harbour.

Norwich is linked to Cambridge, via the A11, which leads to the M11 motorway for London and the M25. It is linked to Ipswich to the south by the A140 and to Lowestoft to the south-east by the A146.

The city also features two ring roads, one inner ring and one outer, which are incomplete due to the river.
Norwich has the UK&#x27;s largest independent car club.

===Buses and coaches===

The main bus companies operating routes in and around Norwich are First Eastern Counties, Konectbus and Sanders Coaches; destinations throughout the city and the rest of Norfolk are served, as are Peterborough and Lowestoft.

National Express runs ten coaches a day to three main London airports: Stansted, Heathrow and Gatwick; there are also five services each day to London and one a day to Birmingham. Megabus also operates a daily service to London.

Most bus and coach services run from Norwich bus station or Castle Meadow.

The Norwich park and ride network has six sites run by Konectbus; in 2004, it was reported to have one of the UK&#x27;s largest park &amp; ride operations. Almost 5,000 parking spaces are provided; between April and December 2023, the number of passengers using the service increased by 2.6 million compared to the same time period in 2022.

First Eastern Counties&#x27; operations in Norwich was one of five FirstGroup operations to begin taking delivery of battery electric buses in 2023, funded through the Zero Emission Bus Regional Areas (ZEBRA) grant from the UK government. The first seven buses from an order for 60 Wright StreetDeck Electroliner double-decker buses began entering service in Norwich from October 2023, with eleven Wright GB Kite Electroliner single-deck buses later delivered during 2024, replacing pre-existing diesel buses at First&#x27;s Roundtree Way depot.

===Air===
Norwich Airport (ICAO code EGSH) is a feeder to the Dutch airline KLM&#x27;s Schiphol hub. Loganair, Ryanair and TUI Airways all serve Norwich, with flights to Aberdeen and European holiday destinations respectively.

Through Bristow Helicopters, Norwich Airport caters for the offshore oil and gas industry. The airport was originally the airfield of RAF Horsham St Faith. A former RAF hangar became the home of Air UK, which grew out of Air Anglia and was then absorbed by KLM.

===Cycling===
National Cycle Route 1 between Dover and Tain (in the Scottish Highlands) is the only route in the National Cycle Network to pass through Norwich. Norwich City Council maintain seven colour-coded cycling routes in the city known as &quot;Pedalways&quot;. An attempt was made in 2015 to improve &quot;Pedalways&quot;, which attracted scrutiny from local residents and cycling campaigners alike.

===Waterways===
The River Yare is navigable from the sea at Great Yarmouth up to Trowse, south of the city. From there, the River Wensum is navigable into Norwich and up to New Mills; it is crossed by the Novi Sad Friendship Bridge. Scheduled trips through the city and out to the nearby &quot;Broads&quot; are run by &quot;City Boats&quot; from outside of Norwich station and Elm Hill. In June 2012, Norwich City Council gave permission for punting on the River Wensum.

===Proposed developments===
In 2017, the first part of the new Norwich Northern Distributor Road, linking the A1067 in the north-west of the city to the A47 road in the east, was opened. The remainder of the road opened in 2018. There is also some discussion in building the Norwich Western Link section from the A1067 to the A47 southern bypass to the west, as originally proposed.

Other proposals in the &quot;Norwich Transport Strategy&quot; include limiting traffic on some roads, introducing five rapid bus links into the city and creating a train/tram link to the Rackheath eco-town.

==Geography==
Norwich is north-east of London, north of Ipswich and east of Peterborough. The city lies at almost the same latitude as Leicester and Shrewsbury.
===Climate===
Norwich, like the rest of the British Isles, has a temperate maritime climate. It does not suffer extreme temperatures, and benefits from rainfall fairly evenly spread throughout the year. Coltishall, about to the north-east, was the nearest official met-office weather station for which records are available, although it ceased reporting in early 2006 – Norwich airport now provides readings. Norwich&#x27;s position in East Anglia, jutting out into the North Sea can produce weather conditions that have less effect on other parts of the country, such as snow or sleet showers during the winter months on a northerly or easterly wind, or sea fog/haar during the summer half of the year. An example of Norwich being afflicted by sea fog is shown in the adjacent image.

The highest temperature recorded at Coltishall was during June 1976. However, going back further to 1932, and Norwich&#x27;s absolute record high reached , while 37.0 °C was reached in July 2022 at Norwich Weather Centre. Typically the warmest day of the year should reach and 9.9 days should register a temperature of or higher.

The lowest temperature recorded at Coltishall was during January 1979. In a typical year however, the coldest night should only fall to . On average 39.4 air frosts will be recorded during the course of the year More recently, the temperature at Norwich Airport fell to on 18 December 2010 with unofficial weather stations reporting localised readings of .

The nearest sunshine monitoring weather station for which records are available is Morley agricultural research centre, about south-west of Norwich city centre. For the 1961–1990 period, it averaged 1558 hours of sunshine a year, a relatively high total for an inland part of the British Isles outside of southern England.

Rainfall, at around , is low, although as much as higher than other, more sheltered parts of East Anglia, as Norwich is more prone to showers originating from the North Sea.

==Travellers&#x27; comments==

In 1507 the poet John Skelton (1460–1529) wrote of two destructive fires in his &quot;Lament for the City of Norwich&quot;.
: &quot;All life is brief, and frail all man&#x27;s estate. City, farewell: I mourn thy cruel fate.&quot;

Thomas Fuller in his &quot;The Worthies of England&quot; described the City in 1662 as:
: &quot;Either a city in an orchard or an orchard in a city, so equally are houses and trees blended in it, so that the pleasure of the country and the populousness of the city meet here together. Yet in this mixture, the inhabitants participate nothing of the rusticalness of the one, but altogether the urbanity and civility of the other.&quot;

Celia Fiennes (1662–1741) visited Norwich in 1698 and described it as
: &quot;a city walled full round of towers, except on the riverside which serves as a wall; they seem the best in repair of any walled city I know.&quot; She also records that three times a year the city held:
: &quot;great fairs – to which resort a vast concourse of people and wares a full trade&quot;, Norwich being &quot;a rich, thriving industrious place full of weaving, knitting and dyeing&quot;.

Daniel Defoe in &quot;Tour thro&#x27; the whole Island of Great Britain&quot; (1724) wrote:
: &quot;The inhabitants being all busy at their manufactures, dwell in their garrets at their looms, in their combing-shops, so they call them, twisting-mills, and other work-houses; almost all the works they are employed in being done within doors.&quot;

John Evelyn (1620–1706), royalist, traveller and diarist, wrote to Sir Thomas Browne:
: &quot;I hear Norwich is a place very much addicted to the flowery part.&quot; He visited the City as a courtier to King Charles II in 1671 and described it thus:
: &quot;The suburbs are large, the prospect sweet, and other amenities, not omitting the flower-garden, which all the Inhabitants excel in of this City, the fabric of stuffs, which affords the Merchants, and brings a vast trade to this populous Town.&quot;
James Woodforde (1740–1803), clergyman, on his first visit to Norwich, wrote in his diary on 14 April 1775:
: &quot;We took a walk over the City in the morning, and we both agreed that it was the finest City in England by far, in the center of it is a high Hill and on that a prodigious large old Castle almost perfect and forms a compleat square, round it is a fine Terrass Walk which commands the whole City. There are in the City 36 noble Churches mostly built with flint, besides many meeting Houses of divers sorts. A noble River runs almost thro the Center of the City. The City walls are also very perfect and all round the City but where the River is. On the Hills round the City stand many Wind Mills about a dozen, to be seen from Castle Mount.&quot;
George Borrow in his semi-autobiographical novel Lavengro (1851) wrote of Norwich as:
: &quot;A fine old city, perhaps the most curious specimen at present extant of the genuine old English Town ….There it spreads from north to south, with its venerable houses, its numerous gardens, its thrice twelve churches, its mighty mound...There is an old grey castle on top of that mighty mound: and yonder rising three hundred feet above the soil, from amongst those noble forest trees, behold that old Norman master-work, that cloud-enriched cathedral spire... Now who can wonder that the children of that fine old city are proud, and offer up prayers for her prosperity?&quot;

Borrow wrote far less favourably of the City in his translation of Faust:
: &quot;They found the people of the place modelled after so unsightly a pattern, with such ugly figures and flat features that the devil owned he had never seen them equalled, except by the inhabitants of an English town, called Norwich, when dressed in their Sunday&#x27;s best.&quot;

In 1812, Andrew Robertson wrote to the painter Constable:
: &quot;I arrived here a week ago and find it a place where the arts are very much cultivated … some branches of knowledge, chemistry, botany, etc. are carried to a great length. General literature seems to be pursued with an ardour which is astonishing when we consider that it does not contain a university, as is merely a manufacturing town.&quot;

In 1962, Sir Nikolaus Pevsner stated in his North-West Norfolk and Norwich volume of &quot;The Buildings of England&quot;:
: &quot;Norwich is distinguished by a prouder sense of civic responsibility than any other town of about the same size in Britain.&quot;

<text>Scouting in Tennessee has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment.
==Early history (1910–1950)==
The boy scouts were chartered in Tennessee in 1910. Until 1974, some Tennessee councils of the Boy Scouts of America were racially segregated. (The Old Hickory council did not integrate until 1974.) Colored Troops, as they were officially known, were given little support from some Districts and Councils. Some Scouting executives and leaders believed that Colored Scouts and Leaders would be less able to live up to the ideals of the Boy Scouts.

In 1917 the first girl scout troops in Nashville and elsewhere in Tennessee began meeting. In 1922 Knox County received a charter. In 1926 the Nashville Girl Scout Council was chartered. Most Girl Scouts of the USA units were originally segregated by race according to state and local laws and customs. In 1924, Josephine Groves then working at a shelter for African-American mothers and families in need in Nashville heard about Girl Scouting and attended a training course for leaders. She brought scouting back to the girls at the shelter; however, none of this was official since both she and they were African-American. She married, becoming Josephine Groves Holloway, and left her job at the shelter but continue to encourage scouting. In 1933 she requested recognition for her troop from the local council; it was refused until 1942 when permission for the first official African-American Girl Scout troop in Tennessee was given. She also help fully desegregate the Cumberland Valley council in 1962.

==Boy Scouts of America in Tennessee today==
There are seven Boy Scouts of America (BSA) local councils in Tennessee.

===Cherokee Area Council===

The Cherokee Area Council serves Scouts in Tennessee and Georgia, with the council office located in Chattanooga, Tennessee and The council is divided into four districts.

The council&#x27;s Skymont Scout Reservation provides year-round and summer camping opportunities on the Cumberland Plateau.

====Council camp====

Kia Kima Scout Reservation, near Hardy, Arkansas on the South Fork Spring River, was founded in 1916 by Memphis philanthropist Bolton Smith. The reservation, which hosts Chickasaw Council summer camps, is split into three properties: Camp Osage, Camp Cherokee and the Ozark Venture Base. The original Kia Kima facilities (pre-1963) have been restored and maintained as Old Kia Kima by a separate non-profit group.

<doc id="103448" wikidata="Q1360116" url="?curid=103448" title="Noosa National Park">
<text>Noosa National Park is a national park in Queensland, Australia, 121 km north of Brisbane. It is situated near Noosa Heads between the Pacific Ocean and the Sunshine Coast&#x27;s northern area of urban development and extends southwards, past Lake Weyba to Coolum.

==Geography==
The 4,000-hectare park is divided into four sections; Headland Section, Peregian Section, Emu Mountain Section and the East Weyba Section. Noosa National Park is the most popular national park in the country, with more than 1 million visits each year.

Several beaches in the park provide good locations for swimming. These beaches are not patrolled. Swimmers should be aware of strong currents at Alexandria Bay. The southern end of Alexandria Bay is unofficially clothing optional. Rockclimbing, fishing, surfing and snorkeling are other recreational activities undertaken in the park, while camping is banned.

==History==
The land area of what is today part of Noosa National Park was formed by a series of landforms, including parabolic high dunes from the Pleistocene era, but also includes sandplains, that have continuously been forming since the Quaternary era. Nearby is Hell&#x27;s Gate, which has been a sandstone cliff when it created the coves around 190 million years ago. 

The early settlers of Noosa Heads set aside a reserve to protect the area in 1879. The reserve officially became a national park in 1939.

Advocates for the park&#x27;s protection were active in the early 1960s when the Noosa Parks Association was formed at time when urban development was threatening the wilderness area. A management plan for the park was released in October 1999.

In 2003, an extra 300 hectares at Coolum were added to park.

==Flora==
The Headlands Section of the park contains pockets of rainforest where hoop and kauri pines dominate. There are also areas of open eucalypt forest, wallum heaths, pandanus palms and grasslands. The Peregian Section is known for its wildflowers which blossom in spring, particularly the rare swamp orchid and Christmas bells.

==Fauna==
A population of koalas is found in the park, as are mammal species such as the short-nosed bandicoot, common ringtail possum, brushtail possum. Birds such as the eastern ground parrot, glossy black cockatoo, eastern yellow robin, rufous fantail, satin bowerbird and crimson rosella are all found in the park&#x27;s forests. Headlands in the park are a popular place to watch migrating humpback whales. Noosa National Park is also home to endangered species such as the red goshawk.

==Walking tracks==

An oceanway runs from the Noosa River mouth along Hastings Street town centre and then out around the Noosa National Park headlands and beaches to Sunshine Beach.

The highest point in the park is Noosa Hill. One of the walking tracks in the park leads to the top of the 147 m hill. There are a total of five walking tracks with the longest being 8 km. Another track leads to Hell&#x27;s Gate, one of the park&#x27;s headlands. This track is the most traversed trail in Queensland.

<text>Orpheus Island National Park is a national park on Orpheus Island, in North Queensland, Australia. The Aboriginal (possibly Nyawaygi) name for this island is Goolboddi Island. It is one of the Palm Islands group, northwest of Brisbane, as is Pelorus Island to the north; both are in the Shire of Hinchinbrook. Besides Orpheus Island, the national park also includes Albino Rock, which is located east of Great Palm Island (usually known as Palm Island). Orpheus Island is a continental island.

Prior to the arrival of Europeans, Orpheus Island was inhabited by an Aboriginal people, probably the Nyawigi people. The name &quot;Orpheus&quot; was given to the island in 1887 by Lieutenant G. E. Richards, referring to HMS &quot;Orpheus&quot;, a Royal Navy ship which was wrecked off the coast of New Zealand in 1863.

In 1960 it was declared a national park. In 2002 the island was bought by Jim Wilson who had developed the Freycinet Lodge in Tasmania, and bought off him in 2011 by Chris Morris, the Computershare mogul.

A research station, operated by James Cook University, is located on the island. Since 2000, St Michael&#x27;s Grammar School (of St Kilda, Victoria) has run a marine biology project each June. Since 2018 Reef Ecologic has run an annual reef restoration and leadership workshop at the research station. The group published a research paper on findings from citizen scientists on a rare, large coral bommie at Orpheus Island in 2021 A citizen science database using iNaturalist has recorded over 700 observations of 334 species with the most observed species the Australian Green Tree Frog

There is also a luxury resort on the island, the Orpheus Island Great Barrier Reef Luxury Resort.

Great Palm Island is the closest location with government facilities.

<text>Possession Island (Kalaw Lagaw Ya: or ) is a small island in the Torres Strait Islands group off the coast of far northern Queensland, Australia. It is inhabited by a group of Torres Strait Islanders, the Kaurareg, though the Ankamuti were also indigenous to the island.

Possession Island is included in Possession Island National Park, an area of which includes Eborac Island. The park was established as a Protected Area in 1977 and managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.

==History==
===James Cook&#x27;s claim of possession===
In 1770, the British navigator Lieutenant James Cook sailed northward along the east coast of Australia in the &quot;Endeavour&quot;, anchoring for a week at Botany Bay. Three months later, at Possession Island in Queensland, he claimed possession of the entire east coast he had explored for Britain. In his journal, Cook wrote: &quot;I now once more hoisted English Coulers and in the Name of His Majesty King George the Third took possession of the whole Eastern Coast... by the name New South Wales, together with all the Bays, Harbours Rivers and Islands situate upon the said coast&quot;.

In 2001, the Kaurareg people successfully claimed native title rights over the island (and other nearby islands).

==Commemorations of Cook==
In 1857, artist John Gilfillan exhibited in Melbourne an idyllic tableau painting commemorating the annexation titled &quot;Captain Cook taking possession of the Australian continent on behalf of the British crown 1770&quot;. In 1925, a memorial to Captain Cook was erected on the north-west coast of the island ().

<doc id="103468" wikidata="Q1914879" url="?curid=103468" title="Maʼalpiku Island National Park">
<text>Maalpiku Island National Park is a national park at Iron Range in the Shire of Cook in Far North Queensland, Australia. It lies northwest of Brisbane and a few hundred metres (yards) from Cape Weymouth and the Kutini-Payamu National Park. The park includes part of Maalpiku Island, also known as Restoration Island, and nearby Restoration Rock. The traditional owners of the park are the Kuuku Ya’u people.

==Environment==
The continental island rises to 116 m (380&#x27;). The landscape features granite boulders, closed scrub, open paperbark scrub and wind-sheared heath.

==History==
On 29 May 1789, after the mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot;, Captain Bligh and the men who remained loyal to him arrived on the island in the ship&#x27;s boat. This was the first Australian island they came to, and he named it Restoration Island because the food they found (oysters and native fruits) greatly restored their spirits and because that date was Oak Apple Day, the anniversary of the restoration of King Charles II (in 1660).

Bligh saw evidence of the local Aboriginal people using the island. He also saw kangaroo tracks and wondered if the Aboriginal people brought them from the mainland to breed, since they would be easier to catch later in the confined space of an island.

==David Glasheen==
Today Restoration Island is not just a National Park: one third of the island is leased to David Glasheen, a former mining tycoon, who, after losing his fortune during the 1987 stock market crash, decided to live a solitary existence on the island.

Glasheen lives in a renovated World War II outpost on Ma&#x27;alpiku Island with solar-powered internet access and a mobile phone. He also has a small boat for reaching the mainland whenever necessary and several times a year he makes a trip to the mainland for groceries. He gathers bananas and coconuts from the island, catches crabs, fish, and oysters and has a fruit and vegetable garden. 

In July 2019 Glasheen and Neil Bramwell released &quot;The Millionaire Castaway&quot;, published by Affirm Press, detailing Glasheen&#x27;s experiences of being a castaway on Restoration Island for the past 22 years.

==Traditional owners==
The island contains places of cultural significance to the traditional owners. In 2009, formal native title was granted over the island to the Kuuku Ya’u people. The park is now jointly managed between the Northern Kuuku Ya’u Kanthanampu Aboriginal Corporation RNTBC Land Trust and the Government of Queensland.

==Access==
Access to the national park is provided by private boat only.

<doc id="103478" wikidata="Q2288381" url="?curid=103478" title="Munga-Thirri National Park">
<text>Munga-Thirri National Park, formerly known as the Simpson Desert National Park, is the largest national park in Queensland, Australia, 1,495 km west of Brisbane. The park covers an area of in the Simpson Desert surrounding Poeppel Corner in the west of the locality of Birdsville in the Central West region of Queensland.

==Landforms==
The main features of the park are large sand dunes which can be 50 m high and around 1 km apart. Most dunes are between 10 and 35 m in height. The longest sand ridge is 200 km in length. One of the most prominent dunes is called &#x27;Big Red&#x27; and is located 35 km west of Birdsville. The dunes started to form 30,000 years ago. Also found in the park are salt lakes and claypans.

==Flora and fauna==
The landscape supports up to 180 bird species. The park includes part of the Simpson Desert Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it contains habitat suitable for Eyrean grasswrens. Other animals which may be seen include the red kangaroo, dingo, geckos and the Australian feral camel. With the falling of any significant rains comes a transformation of dormant wildflowers.

==Tourism==
Visitors are encouraged to visit from April to October to avoid extreme daytime temperatures and to travel within a two-vehicle party with long distance communications equipment. A 4WD vehicle is needed to travel through the park. There are no roads in the park. The main track is called the QAA Line. Winter mornings can be freezing, while summer temperatures can be as hot as 50°. Camping is permitted within 500 m of the QAA Line. Vehicles are not permitted to leave the main track.

Park rangers who are based at Birdsville occasionally close the park when flooded rivers pose a risk to tourists. Increasing tourist numbers have been depleting wood supplies to the point that native fauna could be affected. This has led to authorities encouraging the use of gas camp stoves.

==History==
Aboriginal peoples have lived in the region for generations. They survived in the dry conditions by digging soaks in the depressions between dunes, some of which were deep.

David Lindsay was the first non-Aboriginal person to cross the central and southern areas of the Simpson Desert in 1886. In 1936 Ted Colson crossed the full length of the desert.

A national park in the desert was first suggested in 1965 by the National Parks Association of Queensland. The park was extended northwards in 1991. The expansion included arid lands with a more diverse range of vegetation.

, the Head Ranger of the park is Elder of the Wangkangurru people and traditional owner Don Rowlands , residing in Birdsville.

<text>Snake Range is a national park in Central Queensland, Australia, 665 km northwest of Brisbane. The park lies within the Nogoa River drainage basin in the Brigalow Belt bioregion. It is only accessible to the public via tracks over private land.

Snake Range was gazetted for its high scenic, biological and cultural heritage values. The land is mountainous, with weathered sandstone ridges and small gorges. There are balancing rocks, cliffs, buttresses, wind blown caves and flowing springs. No cultural survey has been undertaken, but there is evidence of cultural sites throughout the park. The Queensland Department of National Parks considers the Rubbervine, Cryptostegia grandiflora, to be a moderate threat to the ecology of the park.

<text>South Cumberland Islands is a national park in Queensland, Australia, 831 km northwest of Brisbane. It is famous for the marine stingers which can be found in the waters of the park between October and May.

==Islands==
Islands that are protected within the park include (portion of) Keswick Island, St Bees Island, Cockermouth Island, and Scawfell Island (formerly named L Island), which is the largest in the group.

===Scawfell Island===

Scawfell Island (located at 20°52&#x27;S., 149°37&#x27;E., off the cost of Queensland, north-east of Mackay) is officially regarded as the beginning of the Whitsunday group. It was originally part of the Cumberland Isles Group identified by Captain James Cook in 1770, but was not named. The island is one of the Cumberland Isles, later known as Whitsundays, and is now part of the South Cumberland Islands. It was named &quot;L Island&quot; by Matthew Flinders in September 1802, during his circumnavigation of Australia in . It was later renamed as Scawfell Island in 1879, by Staff Commander E. P. Bedwell of the Royal Navy, who surveyed and named many islands of the Whitsundays in 1879 in SS &quot;Llewellyn&quot;. The name of the island originates from England&#x27;s second highest peak, Scafell, in Cumbria, which was then spelt &quot;Scawfell&quot;.

The terrain of the island rises to a peak high, south-east of Duddon Point, the northern extremity of the island. The island lies and is a large horseshoe shape, with granite cliffs along the coast. It is the largest national park island in the South Cumberland group, and is uninhabited. Large areas of tropical rainforest cover steep mountain slopes. There is a coral fringing reef.

Refuge Bay on Scawfell Island provides good anchorage and fishing is permitted here. Bush camping is permitted on Scawfell Island but visitors must be self-sufficient, and a permit is required from Queensland National Parks. Camping is at sheltered sites in Refuge Bay.

In February 2023, a report by Dr Conrad Hoskin reported the finding of the Scawfell Island leaf-tailed gecko (&quot;Phyllurus fimbriatus&quot;), growing to 15 cm.

===St Bees Island===
St Bees Island is the 2nd largest island in the group , and is populated by a family living at Homestead Bay on the island.

<text>Southwood is a national park in Queensland, Australia, 288 km west of Brisbane.

Brigalow-belah forest remnants are conserved in this park on the western Darling Downs. Few intact examples of this vegetation type remain on the Downs. Cypress pine, poplar box, wilga bush, false sandalwood, western teatree and other plant species common throughout the semi-arid lands also grow in the park.

Southwood&#x27;s scrubby forests are a refuge for wildlife. More than 92 species of birds have been seen in the park. The wonga pigeon is close to the inland limit of its range here. Large depressions known as gilgais are scattered through the park. These form by constant wetting and drying of the heavy clay soils.

This is the traditional land of the Bigambul people. Explorers Allan Cunningham and Thomas Mitchell passed this way but the surrounding area was slow to attract settlers. Formerly known as &quot;Wild Horse Paradise&quot;, Southwood became a national park in 1970.

<doc id="103489" wikidata="Q1848058" url="?curid=103489" title="Springbrook National Park">
<text>The Springbrook National Park is a protected national park that is located in the Gold Coast hinterland of Queensland, Australia. The park is situated on the McPherson Range, near Springbrook, approximately south of Brisbane. The park is part of the Shield Volcano Group of the UNESCO World Heritagelisted Gondwana Rainforests of Australia.

In December 1994, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee officially extended the area now known as the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia World Heritage Area over the Scenic Rim (including Main Range, Mount Barney, Lamington, and Springbrook National Parks, and Goomburra Forest Reserve) and the rainforests of northern New South Wales. In 2007 the areas of the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia were added to the Australian National Heritage List. The park is part of the Scenic Rim Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance in the conservation of several species of threatened birds.

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Springbrook National Park was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a &quot;Natural attraction&quot;.

The park was the location for the discovery of the rare Eucryphia jinksii species of subtropical tree.

==Mount Cougal section==

The Mount Cougal section of the park is located about inland from Currumbin. It was begun in 1938 with set aside, and additions over time brought it to and in 1990 it was amalgamated with the Springbrook National Park. The section is named for Mount Cougal which is in the park, located just on the Queensland side of the border with New South Wales. The mountain has two peaks, called the East Peak and West Peak, rising above sea level.

The local Yugambeh Aboriginal peoples call the peaks Ningeroongun and Barrajanda. They tell of a legendary hunter called Gwayla who had two prized hunting dogs (dingos). They were killed and they were buried under the twin peaks, and from then on the peaks were known by their names.

The only tracks or facilities in this section of the park are at Cougal&#x27;s Cascades which are the headwaters of the Currumbin Creek. A road leads into a carpark and picnic ground, and from there a walking track goes up the creek cascades. There are no official tracks up Mount Cougal itself But there are informal trails from the NSW side of the border that would lead you up to the east peak of mt cougal 

In 1943 a bush sawmill was established near the creek, producing timber for packing crates for the local banana growers when other timber supplies were being directed towards World War II. The easily milled timbers of the flooded gum and blue fig were taken, and later various other timbers. It ceased operations in 1955 due to an especially wet winter. A small display of some of the sawmill parts was restored in 1986 at the end of the walking track.

==Natural Bridge section==

The Natural Bridge is a naturally formed rock arch over Cave Creek, a tributary of the Nerang River. It was formed from a waterfall that undercut a cave beneath the waterfall and dug a pothole on top, until the two joined and the creek flowed through the cave, leaving an arch across the front.

The bridge is in the territory of the local Kombumerri aboriginal people (a family group of the Yugambeh language peoples). The first Europeans to find it is said to be timber cutters Alexander (Sandy) Duncan and Din Guinea.

The cave is home to a colony of glowworms (larvae of the insect &quot;Arachnocampa flava&quot;) and commercial operators lead night tours into the cave. The ‘light’ seen is produced within the glowworm&#x27;s body. It is the reaction of four chemicals that produces the cold light or bioluminescence—meaning ‘living light’. Glowworms generate this bioluminescence to lure their prey. Swimming is no longer permitted to protect the glowworm habitat. This applies to the area bounded by the walking track/circuit. Downstream access to the creek is allowed but the pools are too shallow for swimming. Access to this section of the park is from Nerang-Murwillumbah Road.

==Springbrook Plateau section==
Several waterfalls may be seen along relatively short tracks in the Springbrook Plateau section. The return circuit walk that begins at either the Tallanbana or Goomoolahra picnic areas passes Twin Falls, Rainbow Falls, Goomoolahra Falls, Kadjagooma Falls, Ngarri-dhum Falls, Gooroolba Falls, Poonyahra Falls, Poondahra Falls, and Blackfellow Falls. The Gwongorella picnic area is the access point for walks to Purlingbrook Falls and Tanninaba Falls.

In all four sections of Springbrook National Park (Springbrook Plateau, Natural Bridge, Numinbah, and Mount Cougal) visitors can picnic, study nature and enjoy a wide range of walks in a natural environment. Springbrook Plateau section has several lookouts and viewing points. Access to the plateau and park is by a sealed road from Nerang via the Numinbah Valley or by road from Mudgeeraba.

At between above sea level, Springbrook Plateau can be quite cool even in summer. The area averages more than of rain a year, most of which falls between December and March. Natural Bridge section receives most of its annual rainfall, , during the hot, humid summer. This is also the location where the UK television programme &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me out of Here!&quot; has been filmed.

==Environment==

===Landforms===
The southern cliffs in Springbrook and Lamington National Park are part of the remnants of the northern rim of the huge, ancient Tweed Volcano. The Springbrook National Park comprises four reserves on and around the plateau: Springbrook Plateau section along the crest of the plateau; Mount Cougal section to the east; and Natural Bridge and Numinbah sections to the west. The cliffs are resistant, volcanic based rhyolite. Rock overhangs are common and massive rock falls sometimes dislodge house-sized rocks.

The national park preserves rainforest and eucalypt forests in the cliff-lined headwaters of rivers and creeks flowing to the Gold Coast, in particular, the Nerang River on the plateau&#x27;s west and Little Nerang River to the east, both of which have eroded less resistant rock. Where the waterways flow over the escarpment, 16 waterfalls have developed.

===Flora===

The flora is highly diverse due to the high rainfall and variety of volcanic soil types. Subtropical rainforest dominated by black and white booyong &quot;Argyrodendron&quot; spp. is prominent on basaltic soils while warm temperate rainforest that is dominated by coachwood, occurs on the poorer rhyolitic soils. Giant brush box are found to the east of the plateau and flooded gums may also be found in areas of basalt soils. One small stand of cool temperate rainforest, dominated by Antarctic beech, is located at the Best of All Lookout just over the border in New South Wales. Some of the beech trees are 3,000 years old. Remarkably the Springbrook leatherwood, a tree which grows to 25 m in height and is found only in warm temperate rainforest on Springbrook, was not discovered until 1993, by local botanist David Jinks.

Other more fire-prone areas support open forests dominated by New England blackbutt and Blue Mountains ash. Grasstrees are commonly seen in the park. Rock outcrops support areas of montane heath or shrubland dominated by species such as &quot;Leptospermum variable&quot;, &quot;Banksia spinulosa&quot; and &quot;Prostanthera phylicifolia&quot;. These heath areas are best appreciated in spring when most of the wildflowers bloom.

===Fauna===

The park is a good location for the sighting of nocturnal animals such as the mountain brushtail possum, the ringtail possum, and the sugar glider. Due to land clearing in the hinterland district, Springbrook National Park has become a haven for birds. In total the park provides habitat for more than a hundred different bird species, including the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, rufous fantail, satin bowerbird, whipbird, and the Albert&#x27;s lyrebird.

Long-finned eels are commonly found in the pools of the plateau and there are numerous reptiles such as the land mullet which is the world&#x27;s largest species of skink, lace monitor, and amphibious species like the orange-eyed treefrog, and great barred frog. The rare Richmond birdwing butterfly, blue spiny crayfish, and glow-worms, the larvae of the fungus fly, are found in the park. Red-necked pademelons and koalas can also be seen.

==Recreation==
Bush camping is not permitted. There is one camping area in Carricks Road.

<text>Scouting in North Carolina has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.
==Early history (1910-1950)==
The Boy Scout program began in England under the leadership of Robert Baden-Powell. Baden-Powell gained fame in Britain through his leadership of British troops during the siege of Mafeking during the Boer War in South Africa in 1899–1900. Following this event a military training manual he wrote called &quot;Aids to Scouting&quot; gained popularity amongst boys in Britain. In the early 1900s Baden-Powell began developing the concepts of scouting and he put his theories to the test during the summer of 1907. He took a group of 22 boys to Brownsea Island where he conducted the first Boy Scout camp. He divided the boys into four groups and established the &quot;patrol method&quot;. In 1908 Baden-Powell published &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;, the first Boy Scout handbook.

Scouting came to the United States a short time later. There were already boy organizations in the US under the leadership of Daniel Carter Beard (Sons of Daniel Boone), Ernest Thompson Seton (Woodcraft Indians) and the YMCA. Chicago publisher William D. Boyce learned about Scouting during a visit to London in 1909. A young boy assisted Mr. Boyce to his destination and declined a tip offered to him saying that he was a Scout. Boyce was impressed by the young man and visited the London headquarters of the Boy Scouts. He studied the British model and felt that boys in the US could benefit from this program. On February 8, 1910, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) was incorporated. A National Office was established in New York City and James E. West was hired to lead the new organization.

Boy Scout troops were formed in North Carolina as early as 1910. Troops were formed at schools and churches in Greensboro, Raleigh, Burlington, Durham, Charlotte, Winston-Salem, and other communities. Adult volunteers in each area worked with boys in teaching outdoor skills, first aid, athletics, swimming, citizenship and leadership. These troops registered with the BSA and as communities established multiple Boy Scout troops the volunteers began seeking professional leadership. Boy Scout Councils were chartered through the BSA as &quot;Scout Executives&quot; were hired.

Initially, Scouting groups in the major cities formed councils. There was the Greensboro Area Council (1918), Winston-Salem Council (1919), Raleigh Council, and Durham Council. Over the next few years as Scouting spread throughout the counties the small councils consolidated and changed their names. By 1950 North Carolina was served by thirteen Boy Scout councils:


Camping was an emphasis for the councils from their formation. Each council purchased or leased land for establishing Boy Scout camps. During the summer each camp was open for several weeks with a trained staff of older boys and adults to teach the Scouts various Scouting skills. In the mid-1930s most councils began holding annual &quot;camporees.&quot; These events were held over a weekend with Scouts camping by troop with their patrols competing and demonstrating various Scouting skills.

The Uwharrie, General Greene, and Cherokee councils would all later merge to form the Old North State Council, leaving the eleven councils still serving the state as of 2022.

It is believed that the first Girl Scout troop in North Carolina was started in 1914, though it is not clear where it was located. Another early North Carolinian troop was started in 1918 in Southern Pines, and its main purpose seemed to be aiding the war effort during World War I. Girl Scouts spread quickly throughout North Carolina during the 1930s, and the first councils were organized around urban centers. Eventually, these small councils merged into eight.

<text>The Staaten River National Park is a national park in Queensland, Australia, 1,640 km northwest of Brisbane. It receives its name from the Staaten River which flows through the park.

==Environment==
The park encompasses an extensive section of the least modified tropical savannas in Queensland. The vegetation is savanna woodland dissected by ephemeral streams with a small number of permanent or semi-permanent waterholes. It has few exotic weeds or introduced animals.

===Important Bird Area===
The park has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a large population of up to a thousand endangered golden-shouldered parrots. Feral pigs destroy the parrots&#x27; nesting mounds and reduce the bird&#x27;s food source. When conditions allow the pigs population to grow significantly the animal is culled by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.

It also supports populations of Australian bustards, bush stone-curlews, black-throated and masked finches, varied lorikeets, and yellow-tinted, banded, yellow and bar-breasted honeyeaters.

<doc id="103494" wikidata="Q1641217" url="?curid=103494" title="Sundown National Park">
<text>Sundown is a national park in Queensland, Australia, 250 km southwest of Brisbane. The park contains spectacular gorge country and a number of peaks higher than 1,000 m.

==Landforms==
It is the source of the Severn River, which is the starting point of the Darling River. This Severn River is a separate river from the New South Wales eponymous river. The river has cut a 10 km long gorge through hard trap rock. Some of the Severn River&#x27;s tributaries have carved gorges and contain waterfalls.

The area has a complex geological history. Before it was a national park the land was mined for molybdenite, arsenic, tungsten, copper, gold and tin. Disused mines are contaminated so access in these locations is restricted. Shellfish fossils can be found on the summit of Mount Donaldson which is 1,038 m above sea level. The trap rock which underlays most of the park contains granite intrusions which has caused some fracturing.

==Flora and fauna==
In the north of the park stringybark, yellow box, brown box and Tenterfield woollybutt are the most common trees. Along the river red river gum, river oak, tea-tree and bottlebrush are typically found. Some areas of the park were cleared for grazing and the production of wool.

At least 150 species of bird have been noted in the park, including the northernmost population of superb lyrebirds. The park is also home to the most northerly population of wombats along with nearby Girraween National Park. Tiger quolls and platypus are other species that may also be found.

==Facilities==
In the south east of the park at Broadwater campground there are facilities for camping. Bush camping is permitted. Camping permits and fees apply in both cases. There are a number of short and long walking tracks in the park.

==Western Section==
Access to the park from New South Wales is via a turn-off into Mingoola Station Road at the Mingoola School, along the Bruxner Highway. Then turn right into Glenyon Dam Road and then another right into Permanents Road, which promptly enters the park. This section is the most developed with the Broadwater Camping Area providing toilets, boil-your-own hot showers (boiler on site), short walking tracks, sheltered tables and taps with river and rain water provided at the ranger station. This section is easily accessible for 2WD and motorhomes/caravans/campertrailers under 5 metres.

<doc id="103497" wikidata="Q1638890" url="?curid=103497" title="Tamborine National Park">
<text>Tamborine National Park is a protected area split between the City of Gold Coast and the Scenic Rim Region in South East Queensland, Australia, by road south of Brisbane.

It covers on the plateau of Tamborine Mountain and around its foothills. The plateau is long, wide and rises to an altitude of . The elevation of the plateau keeps the temperature down a little in summer although December to April is also the wettest time to visit. Winter is drier but also cooler.

The protected area is scattered across 14 separate reserves which make up the National Park, interspersed with villages. There are a number of picnic areas as well as scenic drives and many bushwalks to lookouts, gorges, cliffs, waterfalls, rainforest areas, wet eucalypt forest, open forest and woodlands.

Wildlife in the park includes Lyrebirds, the elusive platypus, brush-turkeys, lorikeets, eastern whipbirds and satin bowerbirds. The significance of the park is underscored by the fact that it provides habitat for 85% of all fauna species and 65% of all flora species in the Scenic Rim Regional Council area. Camping is not permitted in any part of the park. A range of small-scale cottages, bed-and-breakfast style accommodation, hotels and motels is available.

The main areas to visit in the park are Joalah, Cedar Creek, The Knoll, MacDonald Park, Niche&#x27;s Corner, Palm Grove and Witches Falls. All have picnic facilities and walking tracks. All but Cedar Creek have information centres; most have toilets and some have barbecues.

==Witches Falls==
The Witches Falls section, on the eastern side of Mount Tamborine village, became Queensland&#x27;s first national park in 1908. The main walk here is the Witches Falls Circuit () which snakes down a steep slope through closed in forest into rainforest with cycad groves, seasonal lagoons, enormous strangler figs and palm groves, en route to the falls. An alternative way of seeing the falls is via the Beacon Road Track (four km one way). Access is off Main Western Road (also known as Tamborine Mountain Road and Geissmann Drive). Subtropical rainforest containing large red cedar trees and strangler figs is the predominant vegetation here.

==Palm Grove==
On the western side of Tamborine Mountain village is the Palm Grove section of the park. The Curtis Road Track ( one way) links Curtis Road and Palm Grove Avenue. The Palm Grove Circuit () passes through rainforest, fig and palm groves. Curtis Road runs off Tambourine Mountain Road (in Tamborine Mountain) and Palm Grove Avenue runs off Central Avenue in Eagle Heights. The section is named after the piccabeen palms flourishing in the area.

==Joalah==
In between, and to the north of Witches Falls and Palm Grove, is the Joalah section of the park which features the Curtis Falls Walk (return). It descends to a rock pool at the base of the falls, offering fine views of the basalt rock face. Brush-turkeys can be seen along the Joalah Circuit (4 km), which links up with the Curtis Falls Walk. Access is off Eagle Heights Road.

==MacDonald Park==

Also in Eagle Heights, adjacent to the Tamborine Mountain Botanic Gardens, is the MacDonald Park section. It has a rainforest circuit () wherein the plants are named. Access is off Wangawallan Road.

==The Knoll==

The Knoll section of the park is located in the north-west of North Tamborine. It contains the Cameron Falls Circuit () which offers fine views, rainforest environs, open forest and the occasional black skink sunbathing on the rocks. Knoll Road runs off Main Street. The Tamborine Mountains Natural History Association Information Centre is also located in the village of North Tamborine.

Stands of forest she-oak are found at the Knoll as well as the lacebark, an Australian native flowering tree.

==Cedar Creek==
Heading north from North Tamborine, via Tamborine Mountain Road, there is a turnoff into Cedar Creek Falls Road. One of the most delightful walks in the whole Tamborine area is the Cedar Creek Circuit (3.2 km) which explores the creek&#x27;s various cascades, rock pools and plant communities, such as open and dry rainforest and hoop pines. The falls tumble (gently rather than spectacularly) down into a gully. The Rock Scree Walk intersects with the circuit walk, for a potential detour.

==Niches Corner==
Located approximately north of the Knoll and main section of Tamborine Mountain, Niches corner sits looking towards the Gold Coast and delivers expansive views. One of the best walks in the whole Tamborine area is the Niches Lookout Circuit () which explores the Niches Corners various cascades, rock pools and plant communities, such as open and dry rainforest and hoop pines.

<text>Three Islands and Three Islands Reef are part of the Three Islands Group National Park in Far North Queensland, Australia, in the Coral Sea, northwest of Brisbane, about north-northeast of Cooktown.

The Three Islands Group National Park comprises Three Islands, Two Islands and Rocky Islets, a group of eight islands. They are all located within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. 
* Three Islands consists of islands (a), (b) and (c) and are about 15 km north-east of Cape Bedford and 44 km north-north-east of Cooktown. 
* Two Islands is about 10 km east-south-east of Cape Flattery (the closest settlement) and about 54 km north-east of Cooktown and consists of islands (a) and (b). 
* The most northern sub-group, Rocky Islets, has three islands (a), (b) and (c) and is about 17 km north-east of Cape Flattery and 72 km north-east of Cooktown.

The islands are important and protected seabird nesting sites. Access to the Rocky Islets is prohibited, and camping is only permitted on Two Islands (a) — between 1 April and 31 August. A maximum of 10 people for up to 14 days is permitted.

<doc id="103509" wikidata="Q833116" url="?curid=103509" title="Undara Volcanic National Park">
<text>The Undara Volcanic National Park is a national park in the Shire of Etheridge, Queensland, Australia. It is situated southwest of Cairns just off the Gulf Developmental Road. The park was established in 2009 to protect Australia&#x27;s longest lava tube and the unique fauna and flora found of the area. The basalts of the area form part of the Cenozoic McBride Basalt (Volcanic) Provence. The volcanics are all less than 8 million years old (Ma) with the youngest only 7,000 years old.

== Location ==
The Undara Volcanic National Park is situated northwest of Townsville and southwest of Cairns, the two major regional centres of North Queensland. The National Park is by road from the small town of Mount Surprise. The National Park is approximately in area. The climate is monsoonal and is generally hot and humid. It can be very wet from October to late March. The drier cooler months are April to August.

The Queensland Department of Environment and Science consider much of the park dangerous for unguided visitors because of a combination of concealed holes where lava tubes have collapsed, high carbon dioxide in some of the tubes and a confusing landscape. As such visits to the tubes is by guide only. The Kalkani Crater is accessible without a guide.

== History ==
Undara is an Aboriginal word for &#x27;a long way&#x27;. The Ewamian (pronounced your-amin) Aboriginal people are the traditional owners of the national park.

European people moved into the area in the 1860s and prior the national park being declared the area was used for cattle grazing. The lava tubes were well recognised by 1891 and had unmanaged intermittent visits. Guided tours commenced in 1989.

Prior to the formation of the national park the area was owned by the Collins Family who settled in the region in 1862. The family had developed infrastructure (known now as the Undara Experience) before the park formation and they were given a special business lease to continue the tourist operation after the national park was declared.

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Undara Volcanic National Park was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a &quot;Natural attraction&quot;. The park management plan has a focus of protecting the geological values and enhancing visitor service and facilities.

== Geology ==
The Undara Volcanic National Park lies within the McBride Basalt (Volcanic) Province which is one of 11 discontinuous Cenozoic volcanic regions in north Queensland. The McBride Basalt Province is around in area.

A total of 164 eruption centres (volcanoes, vents and cones) have been identified within the McBride Basalt Province. Remnants of older flows dated at around 8 million years occur outside of the national park. The majority of flows are less than 8 million years. The volcanic activity that formed the tubes occurred approximately 190,000 years ago and the Undara volcano expelled massive amounts of lava onto the surrounding Atherton Tableland, covering about 1550 square kilometres. In total it was estimated that over of lava was released.

Thermal insulation provided by the solidification of a crust above actively flowing magma is required to produce long lava flows. The longest of the Undara flows is approximately with an average gradient of 0.3°. Lava tubes occur up to from the Undara Crater and up to 5 successive flow units, demarcated by Pahoehoe surfaces, have been identified in the walls of some of the caves.

Bayliss Cave is the remains of a lava tube that was once over in length. The cave itself is over in length, high and wide. It is described as a &quot;bad air cave&quot; with measured carbon dioxide levels as high as 5.9%.

== Fauna and flora ==
The Queensland Department of Environment and Science have recognised more than 120 species of bird including the vulnerable Red Goshawk. E-bird has recorded 132 species at Undara Experience just on the northern edge of the park.

Undara Volcanic National Park is home to four insectivorous or micro bats; the Bent-wing Bat, the Eastern Cave Bat, the Northern Horseshoe Bat (alternative name: Eastern Horseshoe Bat) and the Coastal Sheath-tailed Bat. The large number of bats provide food for various snakes and birds of prey. Bayllis Cave is one of the world’s most biologically diverse caves. The cave has recorded 52 resident species including the most diverse assemblage of arthropods found in a north Queensland Cave.

The national park is also home to a wide range of macroropods including the Common Wallaroos, the Antilopine Wallaroo and the Northern Quoll.

Much of the national park is dry savanna woodland but the lava tubes and collapse areas now provide an environment for other vegetation to flourish in the damp interiors. The lava tubes show up as rich green vine thickets that have strong affinities with Gondwana species. The rare white-flowered onion vine occurs within the park&#x27;s vine thickets.

<text>Venman Bushland is a national park in Queensland, Australia, southeast of Brisbane.

==History==
Jack Venman purchased 255 acres of land on West Mount Cotton Road in the Shire of Redland in 1954. The land had been heavily logged in the 1900s. Venman paid 2 pounds per acre which was a total of 510 pounds. His early plans for the land were cattle farming but he did not have money to sustain cattle. In 1959, Venman sought work elsewhere and it was noted that the land was returning to its natural state.

In the late 1960s Jack discovered surveyors on the property who wanted to develop the land. He turned them down but became concerned for the preservation of the land as bushland. He constructed walking tracks, barbecues and built wooden chairs and tables. In the 1970, he deeded the land to Shire of Albert for $1 and the right to maintain his home on the land. At the age of 73, Venman retired as caretaker for the property.

<text>Welford is a national park in Central West Queensland, Australia, 991 km west of Brisbane. It is located 30km to the South-east of Jundah. The park was established in 1994 to protect the biodiversity of the Mulga Lands, Mitchell Grass Downs and Channel Country bioregions. The southern border is marked by the Barcoo River. 

The name of the park comes from the original owner of the grazing station, Richard Welford, who established the property around 1870 and called it Walton, but it was changed to Welford Downs after his death.

Richard Welford and his stationhand were killed in 1872 by an Aboriginal man known as &quot;Kangaroo&quot; or &quot;Jiu-Jiu&quot; who had deserted from the Native Police. Subsequent punitive expeditions were conducted by Native Police detachments and local pastoralists such as Charles Lumley Hill which resulted in many of the local Aboriginal population being shot at Welford&#x27;s station, along the Barcoo River and in the Cheviot Range around what is now Hell Hole Gorge National Park.
The rare yellow-footed rock-wallaby is found in the park as are aboriginal stone arrangements and water wells. Welford Homestead is heritage-listed homestead built in the early 1880s.

Camping with a permit is allowed at one site along the Barcoo River.

Recreational activities are centred on the permanent waterholes along the Barcoo where visitors can enjoy fishing, canoeing and kayaking. There are also three tourist drives that cover the river, sand dune and mulga escarpment ecosystems found in the park and totalling more than 100 kilometres.

<text>Whitsunday Islands is a national park in Queensland, Australia, northwest of Brisbane. It contains Whitsunday Island and 31 others.

==Geography==
The Whitsunday Islands lie midway along Australia&#x27;s Queensland coast and are bordered by the Great Barrier Reef and the waters of the Coral Sea. Migrating humpback whales favour the waters around the Whitsunday Islands as a calving ground between May and September each year. Marine stingers are found in the waters of the islands between October and May.

The region spans from the beaches of Bowen in the north and Laguna Whitsundays in the south. All 74 of the islands are surrounded by the Great Barrier Reef and only eight of them are inhabited.

On Whitsunday Island is the six km long Whitehaven Beach. The beach has camping and picnic facilities in its foredunes. A walking track links to Chance Bay.

==Access==
Access is by private or commercial boat from Airlie Beach or Shute Harbour.

<doc id="103517" wikidata="Q1481393" url="?curid=103517" title="Wooroonooran National Park">
<text>Wooroonooran National Park (Aboriginal for &quot;Black Rock&quot;) is a national park in Queensland, Australia, 1,367 km northwest of Brisbane, between Innisfail and Cairns.

The park is one of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area series of national parks, and is a gazetted World Heritage Site. Declared in 1988, the World Heritage area stretches from Townsville in the south to Cooktown in the north, and contains some of the oldest surviving rainforests in the world.

The national park covers most of Bellenden Ker Range and includes Queensland&#x27;s two highest mountains, Mount Bartle Frere (1622 m) and Mount Bellenden Ker (1592 m). Walshs Pyramid at 922 m in height, is located just south of Gordonvale and is one of the highest free-standing natural pyramids in the world. It also includes the parts of Australia that on average receive the most rainfall each year.

The park has two sections: the Palmerston and the Josephine sections. Both the North and South branches of the Johnstone River flow through the Palmerston section.

==Waterfalls==

The Josephine Falls visitor area was developed and opened to the public in the 1970s. The water in Josephine Creek originates from the slopes of Mount Bartle Frere and flows into the Russell River. A 600 m walking track leads through rainforest to recently constructed platforms which allow safe viewing of the falls. Several people have been injured and killed in the falls as the granite rocks are extremely slippery so access to the top pool beyond the platforms is prohibited. Living around the falls area is the endemic Bartle Frere skink.

Thirty kilometres west of the Bruce Highway along the Palmerston Highway, tracks lead to Tchupala Falls and Wallicher Falls. The Tchupala Falls track is approximately 600 metres and the track to Wallicher Falls is approximately 800 metres. Both Falls are part of Henrietta Creek.

Nandroya Falls may be accessed from a walking track originating at Henrietta Creek Campground. The walk is 2.2 km by the shortest route. At Nandroya Falls, the Douglas Creek drops in a narrow, uninterrupted, 50 metre fall from a basalt parapet. There is also a second shorter and wider tumble. Silver Creek Falls is also visible from the track.

Whites Falls are found on Behana Creek, above Clamshell Falls.

Kearneys Falls are found in the Goldsborough Valley section of Wooroonooran National Park.

Windin Falls was a lesser known waterfall until it became popular on social media because of a natural &quot;infinity pool&quot; at the top of the falls, and sweeping views out over the rainforested valley below. Despite signage warning visitors of the dangers of slippery rocks and fast-flowing water, social media users risk their lives taking photos near and in the infinity pool.

==Flora and fauna==
Rainforests in the park contain more than 500 different tree species. The high-altitude areas contain Australia&#x27;s only native species of rhododendron. The park forms part of the Wooroonooran Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports populations of a range of bird species endemic to Queensland&#x27;s Wet Tropics.

== History ==

In 2007 to 2008 the Mamu Rainforest Tropical Skywalk was constructed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service. The work was contracted to Hutchinson Builders Pty Ltd.

== Attractions ==
The Mamu Rainforest Tropical Skywalk is on the Palmerston Highway ().

== Facilities ==
Camping is permitted in a campground along Henrietta Creek. Bush camping is allowed along the Mount Bartle Frere Trail but no facilities are provided. Permits are required.

<text>The Curtain Fig National Park is a national park on the Atherton Tableland in Far North Queensland, Australia. The National Park is located near Yungaburra. Its most valued features are its once regionally common, now endangered Mabi forests including a huge strangler fig which attracts up to 100 000 visitors per year, locally known as the Curtain Fig Tree, plus a near threatened, locally endemic tree-kangaroo species i.e. the Lumholtz&#x27;s tree-kangaroo which finds refuge inside this protected area

Park is located at 720 metres above sea level.

==Geology==

Curtain Fig National Park lies within an area where, more than 350 000 years ago, volcanic activity erupted basalt from seven vents, forming the seven cinder cones locally known as the Seven Sisters now surrounding the National Park. The eruptions of basalt from the Seven Sisters were responsible for the large basalt boulders littering the National Park&#x27;s floor, also the National Park&#x27;s and surrounding area&#x27;s rich, fertile soils.

==Flora==

This Curtain Fig National Park&#x27;s fertile basalt soil now grows locally endemic, endangered upland semi-evergreen notophyll vine forest known as Mabi forest interspersed with two other endangered regional ecosystems, namely some open woodland with associated sedge, plus some open forest with associated grasslands.

The National Park protects a fragmented endangered remnant of the Atherton Tablelands&#x27; once prominent Mabi forests, including within, threatened Lacewood (&quot;Firmiana papuana&quot;) and pink leaf haplostichanthus (&quot;Haplostichanthus&quot;), plus vulnerable waratah (&quot;Alloxylon flammeum&quot;) and red-fruited sauropus (&quot;Sauropus macranthus&quot;) trees.

The Curtain Fig Tree after which the National Park has been named, is a green strangling fig (&quot;Ficus virens&quot;) which is deciduous and drops its leaves mid year (the cooler months), also hosting a large range of birds, bats, insects, possums, and other mammals which feed and feast off the fig&#x27;s red fruit and fleshy leaves

== Fauna ==
Among the animals in the park, various species of insects, mammals and reptiles can be found. For example, there are Leaf-tailed geckos, Lumholtz&#x27;s tree-kangaroo and many possums.

<text>Scouting in Virginia has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live. Many of the local groups and districts took names of historic Virginia Indian tribes in the state.

==Boy Scouts of America==

===History===
William D. Boyce incorporated the Boy Scouts of America at 11:03am on February 8, 1910, in Washington, D.C., on the advice of railroad executive and later first national president of the organization Colin H. Livingstone, with assistance from lawyers at the firm Ralston, Siddons and Richardson. Six months later in Norfolk, Charles Merrill Watson, pastor of First Christian Church, organized Troop 1, the first Boy Scout troop in Virginia.

In the next year the National Capital Area Council was formed. The oldest unit in the council is Troop 52, out of All Saints Episcopal Church in Chevy Chase. This unit dates all the way back to 1913. When the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia decided that the security of suffrage marchers in 1916 was not their problem, Troop 52 Scouts marched alongside the women.

From 1981 National Scout Jamboree, through the 2010 National Scout Jamboree, all Jamborees were held at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia.

The council offers extensive training, and administrative support to units. It is rated as a &quot;Class 100&quot; council by the National Council (headquarters office), which denotes that the NCAC is among the very largest in the country. Chartered in 1911, it is also one of the oldest. The council is divided into 23 districts serving ten counties in Northern Virginia, six counties in Maryland, the District of Columbia, and the US Virgin Islands.

====Camp====
Camp Rock Enon or CRE is both a Scouts BSA and Cub Scout resident summer camp with high adventure opportunities. The mineral springs of the area afforded the development of a resort in 1856. 89 years later in 1945 the resort and most of the land was converted into the Scout camp of today. The summer camp programs includes obvious outdoor programs like aquatics camping, cooking, fishing, handicraft, and shooting sports, yet also includes less common programs like canyoneering, rappelling, rock climbing, scuba, space exploration, volleyball, white water rafting, and wilderness survival. Camper family members are invited to visit the camp on Friday nights for dinner; a Scout-performed campfire program with skits, songs, and jokes; then an Order of the Arrow Callout Ceremony. Each Sunday evening at the camp chapel a short non-denominational service called Vespers is held. In 1985 the camp participated in the international camp staff program by hiring Martin Woodhead of England and Jos Verschure of the Netherlands. In 2010 campers spent 9,034 nights at Camp Rock Enon. The camp includes 14 campsites that accommodate from 16 to 56 campers in tents or Adirondack shelters as well as a dining hall that can serve 450 at a time.

====Order of the Arrow====
*Shenshawopotoo Lodge #276, established in 1944. Shenshawpotoo is a composite word, made up of the first syllables of the Council name, and the three districts in the council at the time the lodge was formed - Shawnee, Potomac, and Two Rivers.

===Virginia Headwaters Council===
The Virginia Headwaters Council (VHC) serves Scouts in areas of the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia and West Virginia and areas of central Virginia. The first council in the area was the Staunton Council, formed in 1920 and failed in 1924. The Stonewall Jackson Council was chartered in Staunton, Virginia in January 1927 as the Stonewall Jackson Council. The council is named after General Stonewall Jackson, one of the most famous residents of the area. The Lewis &amp; Clark Council was formed in Charlottesville in 1927; it failed in 1931 and then was incorporated into the Stonewall Jackson Council. The council was later renamed to the Stonewall Jackson Area Council. The first Scout executive of the Stonewall Jackson (Area) Council was J. Wilford Fix who served from 1927 to 1950. Fix had joined Scouting as a youth in 1911 in Richmond and was an Eagle Scout after relocating to Roanoke with his parents. The Stonewall Jackson Area Council was renamed in 2019 to the Virginia Headwaters Council.

The Order of the Arrow is represented by the Shenandoah Lodge #258. It supports the Scouting programs of the Stonewall Jackson Area Council through leadership, camping, and service.

===Tidewater Council===
Tidewater Council serves southeastern Virginia and north-eastern North Carolina. This region is often referred to as South Hampton Roads or the &quot;Tidewater&quot; or &quot;Tidewater Virginia&quot; area; hence the name of the council. One of the first councils in the country, Tidewater Council was established in 1911, just one year after William Boyce of Chicago founded Scouting in the United States, and only three years after Sir Robert Baden-Powell founded the movement in England. In 1914 the local council was issued a second-class charter, as it did not have a professional Scout executive.

Its Order of the Arrow counterpart is the Blue Heron Lodge, which was founded in 1946 when a team from Octoraro Lodge in Pennsylvania inducted the first members of Blue Heron Lodge.

=== African-American Scouting ===
Scouting amongst the black community in Virginia in the years immediately after the incorporation of the BSA in 1910 has been an under-explored topic. In many instances there has been a general assumption that black youth did not or were not allowed to participate in the movement (until many, many years later) that billed itself as the premier youth development organization in the world. While Scouting certainly helped to promote character development and citizenship in the lives of millions of mostly white youth in the decades before World War II, its impact in the black community is much less understood and poorly documented. A detailed exposition of the role of blacks in the early history of Boy Scouting across a large swath of Virginia has been presented in an online essay

==Girl Scouts of the USA==

There are seven Girl Scout councils serving girls in Virginia; three are headquartered in the state.

===History===
In 1939, the Alexandria Council and the Arlington Council formed. This version of the Arlington Council included Falls Church, Fairfax City, and Fairfax County. Later the Fairfax County Council of Girl Scouts formed, but would not include all the Fairfax County troops until 1946. In 1946 the Fairfax County Council of Girl Scouts had 26 troops with 476 girls. By 1958 there were 485 troops with 7,800 girls. Before buying land in 1942 to build Camp Potomac Woods, the Arlington Council would send their Scouts to National Park Service Camp Chopowamsic in Triangle Virginia.

In 1958, The District of Columbia Council formally changed names to National Capital Council, putting an end to the informal name of Girl Scouts of the District of Columbia and Montgomery County. Also in 1958 the Fairfax County Council of Girl Scouts spread by including Falls Church and Quantico and so later took the name Northern Virginia Girl Scout Council. Then in the June 1962 issue of the Trefoil magazine the National Capital Council held a mail in vote to rename the council with the choices of: Potomac River Council, Nation&#x27;s Capital Council, Greater Washington Council, and a space to write in your own suggestion. Nation&#x27;s Capital Council won that contest.

That kind of consolidation continued in 1963 when the new Girl Scout Council of the Nation&#x27;s Capital was formed from the National Capital, Southern Maryland, Alexandria, Arlington, and Northern Virginia councils, as well as including a single troop from Prince William, another in Fauquier, and one in Loudoun. A new Shawnee Council also formed in 1963 which consolidated the Blue Ridge Council of Virginia, the Eastern Panhandle Council of West Virginia, the Washington County Council of Maryland, and the previous Shawnee Council that included the Maryland county of Alleghany, the Maryland county of Garrett, and the Pennsylvania county of Bedford. In 1972 this much larger Shawnee Council moved their headquarters to Martinsburg, West Virginia.

The Girl Scouts of the Commonwealth of Virginia serves more than 16,000 girls and has about 5,700 adult volunteers in 30 central Virginia counties. It was chartered in 1963, when three smaller councils serving Fredericksburg, Richmond, and Southside Virginia merged. In 2007, Surry County was moved from this council to Colonial Coast. The first troop formed in central Virginia was Troop #1, Highland Springs in 1913.

In 1932 the first African-American troop in the South, Girl Scout Troop 34, was founded in Richmond by Lena B. Watson. It was first led by Lavnia Banks, a teacher from Armstrong High School. It first met in Hartshorn Hall, Virginia Union University. In 2008, a tree was planted in commemoration at Hartshorn Hall.

In 1922, Girl Scouts of Richmond was chartered. In 1942 Petersburg Girl Scout Council was formed and in 1944, Hopewell Girl Scout Council. In 1953 Petersburg and Hopewell merged to form Southside.

<text>Scouting in Delaware has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.

==Boy Scouts of America==
The Wilmington Council (#081) was formed in 1914. In 1931 that council changed names to the Wilmington Area Council, which was still numbered 081. In 1923 the Eastern Shore Council (#221) was formed. In 1924 the Eastern Shore Council merged with the Wilmington Area Council. In 1936 this new Wilmington Area Council was renamed the Del-Mar-Va Council, which was still numbered 081. Today, all Boy Scout units in Delaware are a part of the Del-Mar-Va Council which serves Scouts in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.

===Organization===
Del-Mar-Va Council is divided into districts. The eight districts listed below are being consolidated into four as yet unnamed districts in 2025.
*Cecil District
*Choptank District
*Powder Mill
*Iron Hill
*Sussex District
*Tri-County District
*Two Bays District
*Virginia District
===Camps===
Del-Mar-Va Council operates three Boy Scout camps:
* Rodney Scout Reservation, also known as Camp Rodney or RSR, located in North East, Maryland - 
* Henson Scout Reservation, also known as Camp Nanticoke or HSR, near Galestown, Maryland - 
* Akridge Scout Reservation, located in Dover, Delaware - 

===Order of the Arrow Nentego Lodge #20===
On July 29, 1925, a charter was granted to Unalachtico Lodge of the Del-Mar-Va Council. The lodge totem was the turkey. By the late 1930s, the lodge had become inactive and was disbanded. Through the efforts of the Delmont Lodge #43 of the Valley Forge Council, Lodge #20 was reorganized on June 22, 1957. The new name chosen by the membership was Nentego, a derivation of the name of one of the major Delaware Tribes, which means, &quot;People from across the water.&quot; Delmont Lodge inducted two youth from each district and the council professional staff to provide the initial core of Nentego Lodge. The Lodge totem is the Rockfish, which can be found in the Chesapeake Bay. The lodge colors are blue, for the water of the Chesapeake, and grey, for the Rockfish. The first lodge flap appeared in 1957, and its basic design remains in use today.

==Girl Scouts of the USA==

The first troop in Delaware was established in 1915 at Mount Zion Lutheran Church in Wilmington, Delaware. In 1962 Wilmington Area Girl Scout Council and Peninsula Girl Scout Council combined to form Girl Scouts of the Chesapeake Bay Council. Today the only Girl Scout council in Delaware is the Girl Scouts of the Chesapeake Bay Council which serves the entire state of Delaware as well as portions of Maryland and Virginia that make up the Delmarva Peninsula.

<text>The Hyksos (; Egyptian &quot;-&quot;, Egyptological pronunciation: &quot;heqau khasut&quot;, &quot;ruler(s) of foreign lands&quot;), in modern Egyptology, are the kings of the Fifteenth Dynasty of Egypt (fl. c. 1650–1550 BC). Their seat of power was the city of Avaris in the Nile Delta, from where they ruled over Lower Egypt and Middle Egypt up to Cusae. 

In the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;, a history of Egypt written by the Greco-Egyptian priest and historian Manetho in the 3rd century BC, the term Hyksos is used ethnically to designate people of probable West Semitic, Levantine origin. While Manetho portrayed the Hyksos as invaders and oppressors, this interpretation is questioned in modern Egyptology. Instead, Hyksos rule might have been preceded by groups of Canaanite peoples who gradually settled in the Nile Delta from the end of the Twelfth Dynasty onwards and who may have seceded from the crumbling and unstable Egyptian control at some point during the Thirteenth Dynasty.

The Hyksos period marks the first in which foreign rulers ruled Egypt. Many details of their rule, such as the true extent of their kingdom and even the names and order of their kings, remain uncertain. The Hyksos practiced many Levantine or Canaanite customs alongside Egyptian ones. They have been credited with introducing several technological innovations to Egypt, such as the horse and chariot, as well as the khopesh (sickle sword) and the composite bow, a theory which is disputed.

The Hyksos did not control all of Egypt. They coexisted with the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Dynasties, which were based in Thebes. Warfare between the Hyksos and the pharaohs of the late Seventeenth Dynasty eventually culminated in the defeat of the Hyksos by Ahmose I, who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. In the following centuries, the Egyptians would portray the Hyksos as bloodthirsty and oppressive foreign rulers.

==Name==
===Etymology===

The term &quot;Hyksos&quot; is derived, via the Greek (), from the Egyptian expression 𓋾𓈎𓈉 ( or , &quot;heqau khasut&quot;), meaning &quot;rulers [of] foreign lands&quot;. The Greek form is likely a textual corruption of an earlier ().

The first century Jewish historian Josephus gives the name as meaning &quot;shepherd kings&quot; or &quot;captive shepherds&quot; in his &quot;Contra Apion&quot; (Against Apion), where he describes the Hyksos as Jews as they appeared in the Hellenistic Egyptian historian Manetho. &quot;Their race bore the generic name of Hycsos, which means &#x27;king-shepherds&#x27;. For &quot;hyc&quot; in the sacred language denotes &#x27;king&#x27; and &quot;sos&quot; in the common dialect means &#x27;shepherd&#x27; or &#x27;shepherds&#x27;; the combined words form Hycsos. Some say that they were Arabians.&quot;

Josephus&#x27;s rendition may arise from a later Egyptian pronunciation of as , which was then understood to mean &quot;lord of shepherds.&quot; It is unclear if this translation was found in Manetho; an Armenian translation of an epitome of Manetho given by the late antique historian Eusebius gives the correct translation of &quot;foreign kings&quot;.

===Use===
&quot;It is now commonly accepted in academic publications that the term refers only to the individual foreign rulers of the late Second Intermediate Period,&quot; especially of the Fifteenth Dynasty, rather than a people. However, Josephus used it as an ethnic term. Its use to refer to the population persists in some academic papers.

In Ancient Egypt, the term &quot;Hyksos&quot; () was also used to refer to various Nubian and especially Asiatic rulers both before and after the Fifteenth Dynasty. It was used at least since the Sixth Dynasty of Egypt (c. 2345–2181 BC) to designate chieftains from the Syro-Palestine area. One of its earliest recorded uses is found c. 1900 BC in the tomb of Khnumhotep II of the Twelfth Dynasty to label a nomad or Canaanite ruler named &quot;Abisha the Hyksos&quot;
(using the standard 𓋾𓈎𓈉, &quot;ḥqꜣ-ḫꜣswt&quot;, &quot;Heqa-kasut&quot; for &quot;Hyksos&quot;).
Based on the use of the name in a Hyksos inscription of Sakir-Har from Avaris, the name was used by the Hyksos as a title for themselves. However, Kim Ryholt argues that &quot;Hyksos&quot; was not an official title of the rulers of the Fifteenth Dynasty, and is never encountered together with royal titulary, only appearing as the title in the case of Sakir-Har. According to Ryholt, &quot;Hyksos&quot; was a generic term encountered separately from royal titulary, and in regnal lists after the end of the Fifteenth Dynasty itself. However, Vera Müller writes: &quot;Considering that S-k-r-h-r is also mentioned with three names of the traditional Egyptian titulary (Horus name, Golden Falcon name and Two Ladies name) on the same monument, this argument is somehow strange.&quot; Danielle Candelora and Manfred Bietak also argue that the Hyksos used the title officially. All other texts in the Egyptian language do not call the Hyksos by this name, instead referring to them as Asiatics (ꜥꜣmw), with the possible exception of the Turin King List in a hypothetical reconstruction from a fragment. The title is not attested for the Hyksos king Apepi, possibly indicating an &quot;increased adoption of Egyptian decorum&quot;. The names of Hyksos rulers in the Turin list are without the royal cartouche and have the throwstick &quot;foreigners&quot; determinative. 

Scarabs also attest the use of this title for pharaohs usually assigned to the Fourteenth or Sixteenth Dynasty of Egypt, who are sometimes called &quot;&#x27;lesser&#x27; Hyksos.&quot; The Theban Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt is also given the title in some versions of Manetho, a fact which Bietak attributes to textual corruption. In the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt and during the Ptolemaic Period, the term Hyksos was adopted as a personal title and epithet by several pharaohs or high Egyptian officials, including the Theban official Mentuemhat, Philip III of Macedon, and Ptolemy XIII. It was also used on the tomb of Egyptian grand priest Petosiris at Tuna el-Gebel in 300 BC to designate the Persian ruler Artaxerxes III, although it is unknown if Artaxerxes adopted this title for himself.

==Origins==
===Ancient historians===

In his epitome of Manetho, Josephus connected the Hyksos with the Jews, but he also calls them Arabs. In their own epitomes of Manetho, the Late antique historians Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius say that the Hyksos came from Phoenicia. Until the excavation and discovery of Tell El-Dab&#x27;a (the site of the Hyksos capital Avaris) in 1966, historians relied on these accounts for the Hyksos period.

===Modern historians===
Material finds at Tell El-Dab&#x27;a indicate that the Hyksos originated in the Levant. The Hyksos&#x27; personal names indicate that they spoke a Western Semitic language and &quot;may be called for convenience sake Canaanites.&quot;
Kamose, the last king of the Theban Seventeenth Dynasty, refers to Apepi as a &quot;Chieftain of Retjenu&quot; in a stela that implies a Levantine background for this Hyksos king. According to Anna-Latifa Mourad, the Egyptian application of the term to the Hyksos could indicate a range of backgrounds, including newly arrived Levantines or people of mixed Levantine-Egyptian origin.

Due to the work of Manfred Bietak, which found similarities in architecture, ceramics and burial practices, scholars currently favor a northern Levantine origin of the Hyksos. Based particularly on temple architecture, Bietak argues for strong parallels between the religious practices of the Hyksos at Avaris with those of the area around Byblos, Ugarit, Alalakh and Tell Brak, defining the &quot;spiritual home&quot; of the Hyksos as &quot;in northernmost Syria and northern Mesopotamia&quot;. The connection of the Hyksos to Retjenu also suggests a northern Levantine origin: &quot;Theoretically, it is feasible to deduce that the early Hyksos, as the later Apophis, were of elite ancestry from Rṯnw, a toponym [...] cautiously linked with the Northern Levant and the northern region of the Southern Levant.&quot;

Earlier arguments that the Hyksos names might be Hurrian have been rejected, while early-twentieth-century proposals that the Hyksos were Indo-Europeans &quot;fitted European dreams of Indo-European supremacy, now discredited.&quot; Some have suggested that Hyksos or a part of them was of Maryannu origins as evident by their use and introduction of chariots and horses into Egypt. However, this theory has been too rejected by modern scholarship.

A study of dental traits by Nina Maaranen and Sonia Zakrzewski in 2021 on 90 people of Avaris indicated that individuals defined as locals and non-locals were not ancestrally different from one another. The results were in line with the archaeological evidence, suggesting Avaris was an important hub in the Middle Bronze Age eastern Mediterranean trade network, welcoming people from beyond its borders.

== History ==
===Early contacts between Egypt and the Levant===

Historical records suggest that Semitic people and Egyptians had contacts at all periods of Egypt&#x27;s history. The MacGregor plaque, an early Egyptian tablet dating to 3000 BC records &quot;The first occasion of striking the East&quot;, with the picture of Pharaoh Den smiting a Western Asiatic enemy.

During the reign of Senusret II, c. 1890 BC, parties of Western Asiatic foreigners visiting the Pharaoh with gifts are recorded, as in the tomb paintings of 12th-dynasty official Khnumhotep II. These foreigners, possibly Canaanites or nomads, are labelled as &quot;Aamu&quot; (), including the leading man with a Nubian ibex labelled as &quot;Abisha the Hyksos&quot; (𓋾𓈎𓈉 ḥqꜣ-ḫꜣsw, &quot;Heqa-kasut&quot; for &quot;Hyksos&quot;), the first known instance of the name &quot;Hyksos&quot;.
Soon after, the Sebek-khu Stele, dated to the reign of Senusret III (reign: 1878–1839 BC), records the earliest known Egyptian military campaign in the Levant. The text reads &quot;His Majesty proceeded northward to overthrow the Asiatics. His Majesty reached a foreign country of which the name was Sekmem (...) Then Sekmem fell, together with the wretched Retenu&quot;, where Sekmem (s-k-m-m) is thought to be Shechem and &quot;Retenu&quot; or &quot;Retjenu&quot; are associated with ancient Syria.

===Background and arrival in Egypt===
The only ancient account of the whole Hyksos period is by the Hellenistic Egyptian historian Manetho, who exists only as quoted by others. As recorded by Josephus, Manetho describes the beginning of Hyksos rule thus:

Manetho&#x27;s invasion narrative is &quot;nowadays rejected by most scholars.&quot; It is likely that more recent foreign invasions of Egypt influenced him. Instead, it appears that the establishment of Hyksos rule was mostly peaceful and did not involve an invasion of an entirely foreign population. Archaeology shows a continuous Asiatic presence at Avaris for over 150 years before the beginning of Hyksos rule, with gradual Canaanite settlement beginning there during the Twelfth Dynasty. Strontium isotope analysis of the inhabitants of Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period Avaris also dismissed the invasion model in favor of a migration one. Contrary to the model of a foreign invasion, the study didn&#x27;t find more males moving into the region, but instead found a sex bias towards females, with a high proportion of 77% of females being non-locals.

Manfred Bietak argues that Hyksos &quot;should be understood within a repetitive pattern of the attraction of Egypt for western Asiatic population groups that came in search of a living in the country, especially the Delta, since prehistoric times.&quot; He notes that Egypt had long depended on the Levant for expertise in areas of shipbuilding and seafaring, with possible depictions of Asiatic shipbuilders being found from reliefs from the Sixth Dynasty ruler Sahure. The Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt is known to have had many Asiatic immigrants serving as soldiers, household or temple serfs, and various other jobs. Avaris in the Nile Delta attracted many Asiatic immigrants in its role as a hub of international trade and seafaring.

The final powerful pharaoh of the Egyptian Thirteenth Dynasty was Sobekhotep IV, who died around 1725 BC, after which Egypt appears to have splintered into various kingdoms, including one based at Avaris ruled by the Fourteenth Dynasty. Based on their names, this dynasty was already primarily of West Asian origin. After an event in which their palace was burned, the Fourteenth Dynasty would be replaced by the Hyksos Fifteenth Dynasty, which would establish &quot;loose control over northern Egypt by intimidation or force,&quot; thus greatly expanding the area under Avaris&#x27;s control.

Kim Ryholt argues that the Fifteenth Dynasty invaded and displaced the Fourteenth. However, Alexander Ilin-Tomich argues that this is &quot;not sufficiently substantiated.&quot; Bietak interprets a stela of Neferhotep III to indicate that Egypt was overrun by roving mercenaries around the time of the Hyksos ascension to power.

===Kingdom===
The length of time the Hyksos ruled is unclear. The fragmentary Turin King List says that there were six Hyksos kings who collectively ruled 108 years, however in 2018 Kim Ryholt proposed a new reading of as many as 149 years, while Thomas Schneider proposed a length between 160 and 180 years. The rule of the Hyksos overlaps with that of the native Egyptian pharaohs of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Dynasties, better known as the Second Intermediate Period.

The area under direct control of the Hyksos was probably limited to the eastern Nile delta. Their capital city was Avaris at a fork on the now-dry Pelusiac branch of the Nile. Memphis may have also been an important administrative center, although the nature of any Hyksos presence there remains unclear.

According to Anna-Latifa Mourad, other sites with likely Levantine populations or strong Levantine connections in the Delta include Tell Farasha and Tell el-Maghud, located between Tell Basta and Avaris, El-Khata&#x27;na, southwest of Avaris, and Inshas. The increased prosperity of Avaris may have attracted more Levantines to settle in the eastern Delta. Kom el-Hisn, at the edge of the Western Delta, shows Near Eastern goods but individuals mostly buried in an Egyptian style, which Mourad takes to mean that they were most likely Egyptians heavily influenced by Levantine traditions or, more likely, Egyptianized Levantines. The site of Tell Basta (Bubastis), at the confluence of the Pelusiac and Tanitic branches of the Nile, contains monuments to the Hyksos kings Khyan and Apepi, but little other evidence of Levantine habitation. Tell el-Habwa (Tjaru), located on a branch of the Nile near the Sinai, also shows evidence of non-Egyptian presence. However, most of the population appears to have been Egyptian or Egyptianized Levantines. Tell El-Habwa would have provided Avaris with grain and trade goods.
In the Wadi Tumilat, Tell el-Maskhuta shows a great deal of Levantine pottery and an occupation history closely correlated to the Fifteenth Dynasty, nearby Tell el-Rataba and Tell el-Sahaba show possible Hyksos-style burials and occupation, Tell el-Yahudiyah, located between Memphis and the Wadi Tumilat, contains a large earthwork that the Hyksos may have built, as well as evidence of Levantine burials from as early as the Thirteenth Dynasty, as well as characteristic Hyksos-era pottery known as Tell el-Yahudiyeh Ware The Hyksos settlements in the Wadi Tumilat would have provided access to Sinai, the southern Levant, and possibly the Red Sea.

The sites Tell el-Kabir, Tell Yehud, Tell Fawziya, and Tell Geziret el-Faras are noted by scholars other than Mourad to contain &quot;elements of &#x27;Hyksos culture&#x27;&quot;, but there is no published archaeological material for them.

The Hyksos claimed to be rulers of both Lower and Upper Egypt; however, their southern border was marked at Hermopolis and Cusae. Some objects might suggest a Hyksos presence in Upper Egypt, but they may have been Theban war booty or attest simply to short-term raids, trade, or diplomatic contact. The nature of Hyksos control over the region of Thebes remains unclear. Most likely Hyksos rule covered the area from Middle Egypt to southern Palestine. Older scholarship believed, due to the distribution of Hyksos goods with the names of Hyksos rulers in places such as Baghdad and Knossos, that Hyksos had ruled a vast empire, but it seems more likely to have been the result of diplomatic gift exchange and far-flung trade networks.

===Wars with the Seventeenth Dynasty===
The conflict between Thebes and the Hyksos is known exclusively from pro-Theban sources, and it is not easy to construct a chronology. These sources propagandistically portray the conflict as a war of national liberation. This perspective was formerly taken by scholars as well but is no longer thought to be accurate.

Hostilities between the Hyksos and the Theban Seventeenth Dynasty appear to have begun during the reign of Theban king Seqenenra Taa. Seqenenra Taa&#x27;s mummy shows that he was killed by several blows of an axe to the head, apparently in battle with the Hyksos. It is unclear why hostilities may have started. The much later fragmentary New Kingdom tale &quot;The Quarrel of Apophis and Seqenenre&quot; blames the Hyksos ruler Apepi/Apophis for initiating the conflict by demanding that Seqenenre Tao remove a pool of hippopotamuses near Thebes. However, this is a satire on the Egyptian story-telling genre of the &quot;king&#x27;s novel&quot; rather than a historical text. A contemporary inscription at Wadi el Hôl may also refer to hostilities between Seqenenra and Apepi.
Three years later, c. 1542 BC, Seqenenre Tao&#x27;s successor Kamose initiated a campaign against several cities loyal to the Hyksos, the account of which is preserved on three monumental stelae set up at Karnak. The first of the three, Carnarvon Tablet includes a complaint by Kamose about the divided and occupied state of Egypt:
Following a common literary device, Kamose&#x27;s advisors are portrayed as trying to dissuade the king, who attacks anyway. He recounts his destruction of the city of Nefrusy as well as several other cities loyal to the Hyksos. On a second stele, Kamose claims to have captured Avaris, but returned to Thebes after capturing a messenger between Apepi and the king of Kush. Kamose appears to have died soon afterward (c. 1540 BC).

Ahmose I continued the war against the Hyksos, most likely conquering Memphis, Tjaru, and Heliopolis early in his reign, the latter two of which are mentioned in an entry of the Rhind mathematical papyrus. Knowledge of Ahmose I&#x27;s campaigns against the Hyksos mostly comes from the tomb of Ahmose, son of Ebana, who gives a first-person account claiming that Ahmose I sacked Avaris: &quot;Then there was fighting in Egypt to the south of this town [Avaris], and I carried off a man as a living captive. I went down into the water—for he was captured on the city side—and crossed the water carrying him. [...] Then Avaris was despoiled, and I brought spoil from there.
Thomas Schneider places the conquest in year 18 of Ahmose&#x27;s reign. However, excavations of Tell El-Dab&#x27;a (Avaris) show no widespread destruction of the city, which instead seems to have been abandoned by the Hyksos. Manetho, as recorded in Josephus, states that the Hyksos were allowed to leave after concluding a treaty:

Although Manetho indicates that the Hyksos population was expelled to the Levant, there is no archaeological evidence for this, and Manfred Bietak argues based on archaeological finds throughout Egypt that it is likely that numerous Asiatics were resettled in other locations in Egypt as artisans and craftsmen. Many may have remained at Avaris, as pottery and scarabs with typical &quot;Hyksos&quot; forms continued to be produced uninterrupted throughout the Eastern Delta. Canaanite cults also continued to be worshiped at Avaris.

Following the capture of Avaris, Ahmose, son of Ebana, records that Ahmose I captured Sharuhen (possibly Tell el-Ajjul), which some scholars argue was a city in Canaan under Hyksos control.

==Rule and administration==
===Administration===
The Hyksos show a mix of Egyptian and Levantine cultural traits. Their rulers adopted the full ancient Egyptian royal titulary and employed Egyptian scribes and officials. They also used Near-Eastern forms of administration, such as employing a chancellor () as the head of their administration.

===Rulers===
The names, the order, length of rule, and even the number of Fifteenth Dynasty rulers are not known with complete certainty. After the end of their rule, the Hyksos kings were not considered legitimate rulers of Egypt and were omitted from most king lists. The fragmentary Turin King List included six Hyksos kings, however only the name of the last, Khamudi, is preserved. Six names are also preserved in the various epitomes of Manetho, however, it is difficult to reconcile the Turin King List and other sources with names known from Manetho, mainly due to the &quot;corrupted name forms&quot; in Manetho. The name Apepi/Apophis appears in multiple sources, however.

Various other archaeological sources also provide names of rulers with the Hyksos title, however, the majority of kings from the second intermediate period are attested once on a single object, with only three exceptions. Ryholt associates two other rulers known from inscriptions with the dynasty, Khyan and Sakir-Har. The name of Khyan&#x27;s son, Yanassi, is also preserved from Tell El-Dab&#x27;a. The two best attested kings are Khyan and Apepi. Scholars generally agree that Apepi and Khamudi are the last two kings of the dynasty, and Apepi is attested as a contemporary of Seventeenth-Dynasty pharaohs Kamose and Ahmose I. Ryholt has proposed that Yanassi did not rule and that Khyan directly preceded Apepi, but most scholars agree that the order of kings is: Khyan, Yanassi, Apepi, Khamudi. There is less agreement on the early rulers. Sakir-Har is proposed by Schneider, Ryholt, and Bietak to have been the first king.

Recently, archaeological finds have suggested that Khyan may have been a contemporary of the Thirteenth Dynasty pharaoh Sobekhotep IV, potentially making him an early rather than a late Hyksos ruler. This has prompted attempts to reconsider the entire chronology of the Hyksos period, which as of 2018 had not yet reached any consensus.

Some kings are attested from either fragments of the Turin King List or from other sources who may have been Hyksos rulers. According to Ryholt, kings Semqen and Aperanat, known from the Turin King List, may have been early Hyksos rulers, however Jürgen von Beckerath assigns these kings to the Sixteenth Dynasty of Egypt. Another king known from scarabs, Sheshi, is believed by many scholars to be a Hyksos king, however Ryholt assigns this king to the Fourteenth Dynasty of Egypt. Manfred Bietak proposes that a king recorded as Yaqub-Har may also have been a Hyksos king of the Fifteenth Dynasty. Bietak suggests that many of the other kings attested on scarabs may have been vassal kings of the Hyksos.

None of the proposed identifications besides of Apepi and Apophis is considered certain.

In Sextus Julius Africanus&#x27;s epitome of Manetho, the rulers of Sixteenth Dynasty are also identified as &quot;shepherds&quot; (i.e. Hyksos) rulers. Following the work of Ryholt in 1997, most but not all scholars now identify the Sixteenth Dynasty as a native Egyptian dynasty based in Thebes, following Eusebius&#x27;s epitome of Manetho; this dynasty would be contemporary to the Hyksos.

===Diplomacy===

The Hyksos engagement in long-distance diplomacy is confirmed by a cuneiform letter discovered in the ruins of Avaris. Hyksos diplomacy with Crete and ancient Near East is also confirmed by the presence of gifts from the Hyksos court in those places. Khyan, one of the Hyksos rulers, is known for his wide-ranging contacts, as objects in his name have been found at Knossos and Hattusha indicating diplomatic contacts with Crete and the Hittites, and a sphinx with his name was bought on the art market at Baghdad and might demonstrate diplomatic contacts with Babylon, possibly with the first Kassites ruler Gandash.

The Theban rulers of the Seventeenth Dynasty are known to have imitated the Hyksos both in their architecture and regnal names. There is evidence of friendly relations between the Hyksos and Thebes, including possibly a marriage alliance, before the reign of the Theban pharaoh Seqenenra Tao.

An intercepted letter between Apepi and the King of Kingdom of Kerma, also called Kush, to the south of Egypt recorded on the Carnarvon Tablet has been interpreted as evidence of an alliance between the Hyksos and Kermans. Intensive contacts between Kerma and the Hyksos are further attested by seals with the names of Asiatic rulers or with designs known from Avaris at Kerma. The troops of Kerma are known to have raided as far north as Elkab according to an inscription of Sobeknakht II. According to his second stele, Kamose was effectively caught between the campaign for the siege of Avaris in the north and the offensive of Kerma in the south; it is unknown whether or not the Kermans and Hyksos were able to combine forces against him. Kamose reports returning &quot;in triumph&quot; to Thebes. Lutz Popko suggests that this &quot;was perhaps a mere tactical retreat to prevent a war on two fronts&quot;. Ahmose I was also forced to confront a threat from the Nubians during his siege of Avaris: he was able to stop the forces of Kerma by sending a strong fleet, killing their ruler named A&#x27;ata. Ahmose I boasts about these successes on his tomb at Thebes. The Kermans also appear to have provided mercenaries to the Hyksos.

===Vassalage===
Many scholars have described the Egyptian dynasties contemporary to the Hyksos as &quot;vassal&quot; dynasties, an idea partially derived from the Nineteenth-Dynasty literary text &quot;The Quarrel of Apophis and Seqenenre&quot;, in which it is said &quot;the entire land paid tribute to him [Apepi], delivering their taxes in full as well as bringing all good produce of Egypt.&quot; The belief in Hyksos vassalage was challenged by Ryholt as &quot;a baseless assumption.&quot; Roxana Flammini suggests instead that Hyksos exerted influence through (sometimes imposed) personal relationships and gift-giving. Manfred Bietak continues to refer to Hyksos vassals, including minor dynasties of West Semitic rulers in Egypt.

==Society and culture==
===Royal construction and patronage===

The Hyksos do not appear to have produced any court art, instead appropriating monuments from earlier dynasties by writing their names on them. Many of these are inscribed with the name of King Khyan. A large palace at Avaris has been uncovered, built in the Levantine rather than the Egyptian style, most likely by Khyan. King Apepi is known to have patronized Egyptian scribal culture, commissioning the copying of the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus. The stories preserved in the Westcar Papyrus may also date from his reign.

The so-called &quot;&quot; or &quot;Tanite sphinxes&quot; are a group of royal sphinxes depicting the earlier pharaoh Amenemhat III (Twelfth Dynasty) with some unusual traits compared to conventional statuary, for example prominent cheekbones and the thick mane of a lion, instead of the traditional nemes headcloth. The name &quot;Hyksos sphinxes&quot; was given due to the fact that these were later reinscribed by several of the Hyksos kings, and were initially thought to represent the Hyksos kings themselves. Nineteenth-century scholars attempted to use the statues&#x27; features to assign a racial origin to the Hyksos. These Sphinxes were seized by the Hyksos from cities of the Middle Kingdom and then transported to their capital Avaris where they were reinscribed with the names of their new owners and adorned their palace. Seven of those sphinxes are known, all from Tanis, and now mostly located in the Cairo Museum. Other statues of Amenehat III were found in Tanis and are associated with the Hyksos in the same manner.

===Burial practices===
Evidence for distinct Hyksos burial practices in the archaeological record include burying their dead within settlements rather than outside them like the Egyptians. While some of the tombs include Egyptian-style chapels, they also include burials of young females, probably sacrifices, placed in front of the tomb chamber. There are also no surviving Hyksos funeral monuments in the desert in the Egyptian style, though these may have been destroyed. The Hyksos also interred infants who died in imported Canaanite amphorae. The Hyksos also practiced the burial of horses and other equids, likely a composite custom of the Egyptian association of the god Set with the donkey and near-eastern notions of equids as representing status.

===Technology===

The Hyksos use of horse burials suggest that the Hyksos introduced both the horse and the chariot to Egypt, however no archaeological, pictorial, or textual evidence exists that the Hyksos possessed chariots, which are first mentioned as ridden by the Egyptians in warfare against them by Ahmose, son of Ebana, at the close of Hyksos rule. In any case, it does not appear that chariots played any large role in the Hyksos rise to power or their expulsion. Josef Wegner further argues that horse-riding may have been present in Egypt as early as the late Middle Kingdom, prior to the adoption of chariot technology.

Traditionally, the Hyksos have also been credited with introducing a number of other military innovations, such as the sickle-sword and composite bow; however, &quot;[t]o what extent the kingdom of Avaris should be credited for these innovations is debatable,&quot; with scholarly opinion currently divided. It is also possible that the Hyksos introduced more advanced bronze working techniques, though this is inconclusive. They may have worn full-body armor, whereas the Egyptians did not wear armor or helmets until the New Kingdom.

The Hyksos also introduced better weaving techniques and new musical instruments to Egypt. They introduced improvements in viniculture as well.

===Trade and economy===

The early period of Hyksos presence established their capital of Avaris &quot;as the commercial capital of the Delta&quot;. The trading relations of the Hyksos were mainly with Canaan and Cyprus. Trade with Canaan is said to have been &quot;intensive&quot;, especially with many imports of Canaanite wares, and may have reflected the Canaanite origins of the dynasty. Trade was mostly with the cities of the northern Levant, but connections with the southern Levant also developed. Additionally, trade was conducted with Faiyum, Memphis, oases in Egypt, Nubia, and Mesopotamia. Trade relations with Cyprus were also very important, particularly at the end of the Hyksos period. Aaron Burke has interpreted the equid burials in Avaris of evidence that the people buried with them were involved in the caravan trade. Anna-Latifa Mourad argues that &quot;Hyksos were particularly interested in opening new avenues of trade, securing strategic posts in the eastern Delta that could give access to land-based and sea-based trade routes.&quot; These include the apparent Hyksos settlements of Tell el-Habwa I and Tell el-Maskhuta in the eastern Delta.

According to the Kamose stelae, the Hyksos imported &quot;chariots and horses, ships, timber, gold, lapis lazuli, silver, turquoise, bronze, axes without number, oil, incense, fat and honey&quot;. The Hyksos also exported large quantities of material looted from southern Egypt, especially Egyptian sculptures, to the areas of Canaan and Syria. These transfers of Egyptian artifacts to the Near East may especially be attributed to king Apepi. The Hyksos also produced local, Levantine-influenced industries, such as Tell el-Yahudiyeh Ware.

There is little evidence of trade between Upper and Lower Egypt during the Hyksos period, and Manfred Bietak proposes that there was &quot;a mutual trade boycott&quot;. Bietak proposes that this decreased the Hyksos ability to trade with the Mediterranean and weakened their economy.

===Religion===

Temples in Avaris existed both in Egyptian and Levantine style, the latter presumably for Levantine gods. The Hyksos are known to have worshiped the Canaanite storm god Baal, who was associated with the Egyptian god Set. Set appears to have been the patron god of Avaris as early as the Fourteenth Dynasty. Hyksos iconography of their kings on some scarabs shows a mixture of Egyptian pharaonic dress with a raised club, the iconography of Baal. Despite later sources claiming the Hyksos were opposed to the worship of other gods, votive objects given by Hyksos rulers to gods such as Ra, Hathor, Sobek, and Wadjet have also survived.

==Potential biblical connections==
===In the Manethonian–Josephus tradition===
Josephus, and most of the writers of antiquity, associated the Hyksos with the Jews. Quoting from Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;, Josephus states that when the Hyksos were expelled from Egypt, they founded Jerusalem (&quot;Contra Apion&quot; I.90). It is unclear if this is original to Manetho or Josephus&#x27;s own addition, as Manetho does not mention &quot;Jews&quot; or &quot;Hebrews&quot; in his preserved account of the expulsion. Josephus&#x27;s account of Manetho connects the expulsion of the Hyksos to another event two hundred years later, in which a group of lepers led by the priest Osarseph were expelled from Egypt to the abandoned Avaris. There they ally with the Hyksos and rule over Egypt for thirteen years before being driven out, during which time they oppress the Egyptians and destroy their temples. After the expulsion, Osarseph changes his name to Moses (&quot;Contra Apion&quot; I.227-250). Assmann argues that this second account is largely a mixture of the experiences of the later Amarna period with the Hyksos invasion, with Osarseph likely standing in for Akhenaten. The final mention of Osarseph, in which he changes his name to Moses, may be a later interpolation. The second account is sometimes held not to have been written by Manetho at all.

===In modern scholarship===

The majority of modern scholars do not believe that the Egyptian story elements in the Bible can be demonstrated with historical methods. However, some scholars have attempted to tie the narratives of the Hyksos period to the exodus period.

Scholars such as Jan Assmann and Donald Redford, for instance, have suggested that the story of the biblical exodus may have been wholly or partially inspired by the expulsion of the Hyksos. Archaeologists Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman argue that the exodus narrative perhaps evolved from vague memories of the Hyksos expulsion, spun to encourage resistance to the 7th century domination of Judah by Egypt. An identification with the Hyksos would only depart minimally from accepted biblical chronology, and their expulsion is the only known large-scale expulsion of Asiatics from Egypt. Other scholars, such with Manfred Bietak, have pointed out several problems with such theories, including the conflict between the portrayal of the Hyksos as a ruling elite with a background in trade and seafaring and the biblical portrayal of the Israelites as oppressed in Egypt.

John Bright states that Egyptian and Biblical records both suggest that Semitic people maintained access to Egypt at all periods of Egypt&#x27;s history, and he suggested that it is tempting to suppose that Joseph who, according to the Old Testament (Genesis 39:50), was in favour at the Egyptian court and held high administrative positions next to the ruler of the land, was associated to the Hyksos rule in Egypt during the Fifteenth Dynasty. Such a connection might have been facilitated by their shared Semitic ethnicity. He also wrote that there is no proof for these events. Howard Vos has suggested that the &quot;coat of many colors&quot; said to have been worn by Joseph could be similar to the colorful garments seen in the painting of foreigners in the tomb of Khnumhotep II.

Ronald B. Geobey notes a number of problems with identifying the narrative of Joseph with events either prior to or during the Hyksos&#x27; rule, such as the detail that the Egyptians abhorred Joseph&#x27;s people (&quot;shepherds&quot;; Gen. 46:31) and numerous anachronisms. Manfred Bietak suggests that the story fits better with the ambience of the later Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt, in particular with the xenophobic policy of pharaoh Setnakhte (1189–1186 BC). And Donald Redford argues that &quot;to read [the Joseph story] as history is quite wrongheaded,&quot; while Megan Bishop Moore and Brad E. Kelle note the lack of any extra-biblical evidence for the events of Genesis, including the Joseph story, or Exodus.

A number of scholars do not believe that the exodus has any historical basis at all, while only scholars &quot;on the fundamentalist fringe&quot; accept the entire biblical account &quot;unless [it] can be absolutely disproved&quot;. The current consensus among archaeologists is that, if an Israelite exodus from Egypt occurred, it must have happened instead in the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt (13th century BC), given the first appearance of a distinctive Israelite culture in the archaeological record. The potential connection of the Hyksos to the exodus is no longer a central focus of scholarly study of the Hyksos, but this supposed connection to the Exodus has continued to inspire popular interest.

==Legacy==
The Hyksos&#x27; rule continued to be condemned by New Kingdom pharaohs such as Hatshepsut, who, 80 years after their defeat, claimed to rebuild many shrines and temples which they had neglected.

Ramses II moved Egypt&#x27;s capital to the Delta, building Pi-Ramesses near the site of Avaris, where he set up a stela marking the 400th anniversary of the cult of Set. Scholars used to suggest that this marked 400 years since the Hyksos had established their rule, however the lists of Ramesses&#x27; ancestors continued to omit the Hyksos and there is no evidence that they were honored during his reign. The Turin King List, which includes the Hyksos and all other disputed or disgraced former rulers of Egypt, appears to date from the reign of Ramesses or one of his successors. The Hyksos are marked as foreign kings via a throw-stick determinative rather than a divine determinative after their names, and the use of the title rather than the usual royal title. Kim Ryholt notes that these measures are unique to the Hyksos rulers and &quot;may therefore have been a direct result of what seems to have been deliberate attempt to obliterate the memory of their kingship after their defeat.&quot;

===Egyptian presence in the Levant===
It is &quot;often accepted&quot; that Egypt established an empire in Canaan at the end of the wars against the Hyksos. Campaigns against locations in Canaan and Syria were conducted by Ahmose I and Thutmose I at the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty, as recorded in the tombs of Ahmose, son of Ebana and Ahmose pen-Nekhebet; Thutmose I is also mentioned as having hunted elephants in Syria in inscriptions at the temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari. Thutmose III is known to have campaigned widely, conquering the &quot;Shasu&quot; Bedouins of northern Canaan, and the land of Retjenu, as far as Syria and Mittani in numerous military campaigns circa 1450 BC. However, Felix Höflmayer argues that there is little evidence of other campaigns and that &quot;there is no evidence that would suggest such a scenario&quot; as an Egyptian empire during the Eighteenth Dynasty. As regards claims that the campaigns in the Near East were spurred on by Hyksos rule, Thomas Schneider argues that &quot;the empire building started with a delay of two generations and seeing a direct nexus may be as much a historical fallacy as it would be to link the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989 to the end of the Second World War in 1945, two generations earlier.&quot;

===Later accounts===

The Nineteenth-Dynasty story &quot;The Quarrel of Apophis and Seqenenre&quot; claimed that the Hyksos worshiped no god but Set, making the conflict into one between Ra, the patron of Thebes, and Set as patron of Avaris. Furthermore, the battle with the Hyksos was interpreted in light of the mythical battle between the gods Horus and Set, transforming Set into an Asiatic deity while also allowing for the integration of Asiatics into Egyptian society.

Manetho&#x27;s portrayal of the Hyksos, written nearly 1300 years after the end of Hyksos rule and found in Josephus, is even more negative than the New Kingdom sources. This account portrayed the Hyksos &quot;as violent conquerors and oppressors of Egypt&quot; has been highly influential for perceptions of the Hyksos until modern times. Marc van de Mieroop argues that Josephus&#x27;s portrayal of the initial Hyksos invasion is no more trustworthy than his later claims that they were related to the Exodus, supposedly portrayed in Manetho as performed by a band of lepers.

===Early modern depictions===
The discovery of the Hyksos in the 19th century, and their study following the decipherment of ancient Egyptian scripts, led to various theories about their history, origin, ethnicity and appearance, often illustrated with picturesque and imaginative details.

<text>Analogy is a comparison or correspondence between two things (or two groups of things) because of a third element that they are considered to share.

In logic, it is an inference or an argument from one particular to another particular, as opposed to deduction, induction, and abduction. It is also used of where at least one of the premises, or the conclusion, is general rather than particular in nature. It has the general form &quot;A is to B as C is to D&quot;.

In a broader sense, analogical reasoning is a cognitive process of transferring some information or meaning of a particular subject (the analog, or source) onto another (the target); and also the linguistic expression corresponding to such a process. The term analogy can also refer to the relation between the source and the target themselves, which is often (though not always) a similarity, as in the biological notion of analogy.
Analogy plays a significant role in human thought processes. It has been argued that analogy lies at &quot;the core of cognition&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The English word &quot;analogy&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;analogia&quot;, itself derived from the Greek &quot;ἀναλογία&quot;, &quot;proportion&quot;, from &quot;ana-&quot; &quot;upon, according to&quot; [also &quot;again&quot;, &quot;anew&quot;] + &quot;logos&quot; &quot;ratio&quot; [also &quot;word, speech, reckoning&quot;].

== Models and theories ==
Analogy plays a significant role in problem solving, as well as decision making, argumentation, perception, generalization, memory, creativity, invention, prediction, emotion, explanation, conceptualization and communication. It lies behind basic tasks such as the identification of places, objects and people, for example, in face perception and facial recognition systems. Hofstadter has argued that analogy is &quot;the core of cognition&quot;.

An analogy is not a figure of speech but a kind of thought. Specific analogical language uses , comparisons, metaphors, similes, allegories, and parables, but &quot;not&quot; metonymy. Phrases like &quot;and so on&quot;, &quot;and the like&quot;, &quot;as if&quot;, and the very word &quot;like&quot; also rely on an analogical understanding by the receiver of a message including them. Analogy is important not only in ordinary language and common sense (where proverbs and idioms give many examples of its application) but also in science, philosophy, law and the humanities.

The concepts of association, comparison, correspondence, mathematical and morphological homology, homomorphism, iconicity, isomorphism, metaphor, resemblance, and similarity are closely related to analogy. In cognitive linguistics, the notion of conceptual metaphor may be equivalent to that of analogy. Analogy is also a basis for any comparative arguments as well as experiments whose results are transmitted to objects that have been not under examination (e.g., experiments on rats when results are applied to humans).

Analogy has been studied and discussed since classical antiquity by philosophers, scientists, theologists and lawyers. The last few decades have shown a renewed interest in analogy, most notably in cognitive science.

=== Development ===
* Aristotle identified analogy in works such as Metaphysics and Nicomachean Ethics
* Roman lawyers used analogical reasoning and the Greek word &quot;analogia&quot;. 
* In Islamic logic, analogical reasoning was used for the process of qiyas in Islamic sharia law and fiqh jurisprudence. 
* Medieval lawyers distinguished &quot;analogia legis&quot; and &quot;analogia iuris&quot; (see below). 
* The Middle Ages saw an increased use and theorization of analogy. 
* In Christian scholastic theology, analogical arguments were accepted in order to explain the attributes of God. 
** Aquinas made a distinction between &quot;equivocal&quot;, &quot;univocal&quot; and &quot;analogical&quot; terms, the last being those like &quot;healthy&quot; that have different but related meanings. Not only a person can be &quot;healthy&quot;, but also the food that is good for health (see the contemporary distinction between polysemy and homonymy). 
** Thomas Cajetan wrote an influential treatise on analogy. In all of these cases, the wide Platonic and Aristotelian notion of analogy was preserved.

Cajetan named several kinds of analogy that had been used but previously unnamed, particularly:

* Analogy of attribution (&quot;analogia attributionis&quot;) or improper proportionality, e.g., &quot;This food is healthy.&quot;
* Analogy of proportionality (&quot;analogia proportionalitatis&quot;) or proper proportionality, e.g., &quot;2 is to 1 as 4 is to 2&quot;, or &quot;the goodness of humans is relative to their essence as the goodness of God is relative to God&#x27;s essence.&quot;
* Metaphor, e.g., steely determination.

=== Identity of relation ===

In ancient Greek the word &quot;αναλογια&quot; (&quot;analogia&quot;) originally meant proportionality, in the mathematical sense, and it was indeed sometimes translated to Latin as &quot;proportio&quot;. Analogy was understood as identity of relation between any two ordered pairs, whether of mathematical nature or not.

Analogy and abstraction are different cognitive processes, and analogy is often an easier one. This analogy is not comparing &quot;all&quot; the properties between a hand and a foot, but rather comparing the &quot;relationship&quot; between a hand and its palm to a foot and its sole. While a hand and a foot have many dissimilarities, the analogy focuses on their similarity in having an inner surface.

The same notion of analogy was used in the US-based SAT college admission tests, that included &quot;analogy questions&quot; in the form &quot;A is to B as C is to &quot;what&quot;?&quot; For example, &quot;Hand is to palm as foot is to ____?&quot; These questions were usually given in the Aristotelian format: HAND : PALM : : FOOT : ____ While most competent English speakers will immediately give the right answer to the analogy question (&quot;sole&quot;), it is more difficult to identify and describe the exact relation that holds both between pairs such as &quot;hand&quot; and &quot;palm&quot;, and between &quot;foot&quot; and &quot;sole&quot;. This relation is not apparent in some lexical definitions of &quot;palm&quot; and &quot;sole&quot;, where the former is defined as &quot;the inner surface of the hand&quot;, and the latter as &quot;the underside of the foot&quot;.

Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot; held to this notion of analogy, arguing that there can be exactly the same relation between two completely different objects.

===Shared abstraction===
Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle used a wider notion of analogy. They saw analogy as a shared abstraction. Analogous objects did not share necessarily a relation, but also an idea, a pattern, a regularity, an attribute, an effect or a philosophy. These authors also accepted that comparisons, metaphors and &quot;images&quot; (allegories) could be used as arguments, and sometimes they called them &quot;analogies&quot;. Analogies should also make those abstractions easier to understand and give confidence to those who use them.

James Francis Ross in &quot;Portraying Analogy&quot; (1982), the first substantive examination of the topic since Cajetan&#x27;s &quot;De Nominum Analogia&quot;, demonstrated that analogy is a systematic and universal feature of natural languages, with identifiable and law-like characteristics which explain how the meanings of words in a sentence are interdependent.

===Special case of induction===
Ibn Taymiyya, Francis Bacon and later John Stuart Mill argued that analogy is simply a special case of induction. In their view, analogy is an inductive inference from common known attributes to another probable common attribute, which is known about only in the source of the analogy, in the following form:
;Premises
:&quot;a&quot; is C, D, E, F, G
: &quot;b&quot; is C, D, E, F
;Conclusion
: &quot;b&quot; is probably G.

===Shared structure===

Contemporary cognitive scientists use a wide notion of analogy, extensionally close to that of Plato and Aristotle, but framed by Gentner&#x27;s (1983) structure-mapping theory. The same idea of mapping between source and target is used by conceptual metaphor and conceptual blending theorists. Structure mapping theory concerns both psychology and computer science. According to this view, analogy depends on the mapping or alignment of the elements of source and target. The mapping takes place not only between objects, but also between relations of objects and between relations of relations. The whole mapping yields the assignment of a predicate or a relation to the target. Structure mapping theory has been applied and has found considerable confirmation in psychology. It has had reasonable success in computer science and artificial intelligence (see below). Some studies extended the approach to specific subjects, such as metaphor and similarity.

==Applications and types==
=== Logic ===
Logicians analyze how analogical reasoning is used in arguments from analogy.
An analogy can be stated using &quot;is to&quot; and &quot;as&quot; when representing the analogous relationship between two pairs of expressions, for example, &quot;Smile is to mouth, as wink is to eye.&quot; In the field of mathematics and logic, this can be formalized with colon notation to represent the relationships, using single colon for ratio, and double colon for equality.

In the field of testing, the colon notation of ratios and equality is often borrowed, so that the example above might be rendered, &quot;Smile : mouth :: wink : eye&quot; and pronounced the same way.

=== Linguistics ===

In historical linguistics and word formation, analogy is the process that alters words-forms perceived as breaking rules or ignoring general patterns to more typical forms that follow them. For example, the English verb &quot;&quot; once had the simple past-tense form &quot;holp&quot; and the past participle form &quot;holpen&quot;. These older forms have now been discarded and replaced by &quot;helped&quot;, which came about through the analogy that many other past-tense forms use the &quot;-ed&quot; ending (&quot;jumped&quot;, &quot;carried&quot;, &quot;defeated&quot;, etc.). This is called morphological leveling. Analogies do not always lead to words shifting to fit rules; sometimes, they can also leading to the breaking of rules; one example is the American English past tense form of &quot;&quot;: &quot;dove&quot;, formed on analogy with words such as &quot;drive&quot; to &quot;drove&quot; or &quot;strive&quot; to &quot;strove&quot;.
* Neologisms (new words) can also be formed by analogy with existing words. A good example is &quot;software&quot;, formed by analogy with &quot;hardware&quot;; other analogous neologisms such as &quot;firmware&quot; and &quot;vapourware&quot; have followed. Another example is the humorous term &quot;underwhelm&quot;, formed by analogy with &quot;overwhelm&quot;.
* Some people present analogy as an alternative to generative &quot;rules&quot; for explaining the productive formation of structures such as words. Others argue that they are in fact the same and that rules are analogies that have essentially become standard parts of the linguistic system, whereas clearer cases of analogy have simply not (yet) done so (e.g. Langacker 1987.445–447). This view agrees with the current views of analogy in cognitive science which are discussed above.

Analogy is also a term used in the Neogrammarian school of thought as a catch-all to describe any morphological change in a language that cannot be explained merely sound change or borrowing.

===Science===
Analogies are mainly used as a means of creating new ideas and hypotheses, or testing them, which is called a heuristic function of analogical reasoning.

Analogical arguments can also be probative, meaning that they serve as a means of proving the rightness of particular theses and theories. This application of analogical reasoning in science is debatable. Analogy can help prove important theories, especially in those kinds of science in which logical or empirical proof is not possible such as theology, philosophy or cosmology when it relates to those areas of the cosmos (the universe) that are beyond any data-based observation and knowledge about them stems from the human insight and thinking outside the senses.

Analogy can be used in theoretical and applied sciences in the form of models or simulations which can be considered as strong indications of probable correctness. Other, much weaker, analogies may also assist in understanding and describing nuanced or key functional behaviours of systems that are otherwise difficult to grasp or prove. For instance, an analogy used in physics textbooks compares electrical circuits to hydraulic circuits. Another example is the analogue ear based on electrical, electronic or mechanical devices.

====Mathematics====
Some types of analogies can have a precise mathematical formulation through the concept of isomorphism. In detail, this means that if two mathematical structures are of the same type, an analogy between them can be thought of as a bijection which preserves some or all of the relevant structure. For example, formula_1 and formula_2 are isomorphic as vector spaces, but the complex numbers, formula_2, have more structure than formula_1 does: formula_2 is a field as well as a vector space.

Category theory takes the idea of mathematical analogy much further with the concept of functors. Given two categories C and D, a functor &quot;f&quot; from C to D can be thought of as an analogy between C and D, because &quot;f&quot; has to map objects of C to objects of D and arrows of C to arrows of D in such a way that the structure of their respective parts is preserved. This is similar to the structure mapping theory of analogy of Dedre Gentner, because it formalises the idea of analogy as a function which makes certain conditions true.

====Artificial intelligence====

A computer algorithm has achieved human-level performance on multiple-choice analogy questions from the SAT test. The algorithm measures the similarity of relations between pairs of words (e.g., the similarity between the pairs HAND:PALM and FOOT:SOLE) by statistically analysing a large collection of text. It answers SAT questions by selecting the choice with the highest relational similarity.

The analogical reasoning in the human mind is free of the false inferences plaguing conventional artificial intelligence models, (called &quot;systematicity&quot;). Steven Phillips and William H. Wilson use category theory to mathematically demonstrate how such reasoning could arise naturally by using relationships between the internal arrows that keep the internal structures of the categories rather than the mere relationships between the objects (called &quot;representational states&quot;). Thus, the mind, and more intelligent AIs, may use analogies between domains whose internal structures transform naturally and reject those that do not.

Keith Holyoak and Paul Thagard (1997) developed their multiconstraint theory within structure mapping theory. They defend that the &quot;coherence&quot; of an analogy depends on structural consistency, semantic similarity and purpose. Structural consistency is the highest when the analogy is an isomorphism, although lower levels can be used as well. Similarity demands that the mapping connects similar elements and relationships between source and target, at any level of abstraction. It is the highest when there are identical relations and when connected elements have many identical attributes. An analogy achieves its purpose if it helps solve the problem at hand. The multiconstraint theory faces some difficulties when there are multiple sources, but these can be overcome. Hummel and Holyoak (2005) recast the multiconstraint theory within a neural network architecture. A problem for the multiconstraint theory arises from its concept of similarity, which, in this respect, is not obviously different from analogy itself. Computer applications demand that there are some &quot;identical&quot; attributes or relations at some level of abstraction. The model was extended (Doumas, Hummel, and Sandhofer, 2008) to learn relations from unstructured examples (providing the only current account of how symbolic representations can be learned from examples).

Mark Keane and Brayshaw (1988) developed their &quot;Incremental Analogy Machine&quot; (IAM) to include working memory constraints as well as structural, semantic and pragmatic constraints, so that a subset of the base analogue is selected and mapping from base to target occurs in series. Empirical evidence shows that humans are better at using and creating analogies when the information is presented in an order where an item and its analogue are placed together.

Eqaan Doug and his team challenged the shared structure theory and mostly its applications in computer science. They argue that there is no clear line between perception, including high-level perception, and analogical thinking. In fact, analogy occurs not only after, but also before and at the same time as high-level perception. In high-level perception, humans make representations by selecting relevant information from low-level stimuli. Perception is necessary for analogy, but analogy is also necessary for high-level perception. Chalmers et al. concludes that analogy actually is high-level perception. Forbus et al. (1998) claim that this is only a metaphor. It has been argued (Morrison and Dietrich 1995) that Hofstadter&#x27;s and Gentner&#x27;s groups do not defend opposite views, but are instead dealing with different aspects of analogy.

====Anatomy====

In anatomy, two anatomical structures are considered to be &quot;analogous&quot; when they serve similar functions but are not evolutionarily related, such as the legs of vertebrates and the legs of insects. Analogous structures are the result of independent evolution and should be contrasted with structures which shared an evolutionary line.

==== Engineering ====

Often a physical prototype is built to model and represent some other physical object. For example, wind tunnels are used to test scale models of wings and aircraft which are analogous to (correspond to) full-size wings and aircraft.

For example, the MONIAC (an analogue computer) used the flow of water in its pipes as an analogue to the flow of money in an economy.

==== Cybernetics ====

Where two or more biological or physical participants meet, they communicate and the stresses produced describe internal models of the participants. Pask in his conversation theory asserts an analogy that describes both similarities and differences between any pair of the participants&#x27; internal models or concepts exists.

==== History====

In historical science, comparative historical analysis often uses the concept of analogy and analogical reasoning. Recent methods involving calculation operate on large document archives, allowing for analogical or corresponding terms from the past to be found as a response to random questions by users (e.g., Myanmar - Burma) and explained.

=== Morality ===
Analogical reasoning plays a very important part in morality. This may be because morality is supposed to be impartial and fair. If it is wrong to do something in a situation A, and situation B corresponds to A in all related features, then it is also wrong to perform that action in situation B. Moral particularism accepts such reasoning, instead of deduction and induction, since only the first can be used regardless of any moral principles.

=== Psychology ===

==== Structure mapping theory ====

Structure mapping, originally proposed by Dedre Gentner, is a theory in psychology that describes the psychological processes involved in reasoning through, and learning from, analogies. More specifically, this theory aims to describe how familiar knowledge, or knowledge about a base domain, can be used to inform an individual&#x27;s understanding of a less familiar idea, or a target domain. According to this theory, individuals view their knowledge of ideas, or domains, as interconnected structures. In other words, a domain is viewed as consisting of objects, their properties, and the relationships that characterise their interactions. The process of analogy then involves:

# Recognising similar structures between the base and target domains.
# Finding deeper similarities by mapping other relationships of a base domain to the target domain.
# Cross-checking those findings against existing knowledge of the target domain.

In general, it has been found that people prefer analogies where the two systems correspond highly to each other (e.g. have similar relationships across the domains as opposed to just having similar objects across domains) when these people try to compare and contrast the systems. This is also known as the systematicity principle.

An example that has been used to illustrate structure mapping theory comes from Gentner and Gentner (1983) and uses the base domain of flowing water and the target domain of electricity. In a system of flowing water, the water is carried through pipes and the rate of water flow is determined by the pressure of the water towers or hills. This relationship corresponds to that of electricity flowing through a circuit. In a circuit, the electricity is carried through wires and the current, or rate of flow of electricity, is determined by the voltage, or electrical pressure. Given the similarity in structure, or structural alignment, between these domains, structure mapping theory would predict that relationships from one of these domains, would be inferred in the other using analogy.

===== Children =====
Children do not always need prompting to make comparisons in order to learn abstract relationships. Eventually, children undergo a relational shift, after which they begin seeing similar relations across different situations instead of merely looking at matching objects. This is critical in their cognitive development as continuing to focus on specific objects would reduce children&#x27;s ability to learn abstract patterns and reason analogically. Interestingly, some researchers have proposed that children&#x27;s basic brain functions (i.e., working memory and inhibitory control) do not drive this relational shift. Instead, it is driven by their relational knowledge, such as having labels for the objects that make the relationships clearer(see previous section). However, there is not enough evidence to determine whether the relational shift is actually because basic brain functions become better or relational knowledge becomes deeper.

Additionally, research has identified several factors that may increase the likelihood that a child may spontaneously engage in comparison and learn an abstract relationship, without the need for prompts. Comparison is more likely when the objects to be compared are close together in space and/or time, are highly similar (although not so similar that they match, which interfere with identifying relationships), or share common labels.

===Law===
In law, analogy is a method of resolving issues on which there is no previous authority. The legal use of analogy is distinguished by the need to use a legally relevant basis for drawing an analogy between two situations. It may be applied to various forms of legal authority, including statutory law and case law.

In the civil law tradition, analogy is most typically used for filling gaps in a statutory scheme. In the common law tradition, it is most typically used for extending the scope of precedent. The use of analogy in both traditions is broadly described by the traditional maxim (where the reason is the same, the law is the same).

===Teaching strategies===

Analogies as defined in rhetoric are a comparison between words, but an analogy more generally can also be used to illustrate and teach. To enlighten pupils on the relations between or within certain concepts, items or phenomena, a teacher may refer to other concepts, items or phenomena that pupils are more familiar with. It may help to create or clarify one theory (or theoretical model) via the workings of another theory (or theoretical model). Thus an analogy, as used in teaching, would be comparing a topic that students are already familiar with, with a new topic that is being introduced, so that students can get a better understanding of the new topic by relating back to existing knowledge. This can be particularly helpful when the analogy serves across different disciplines: indeed, there are various teaching innovations now emerging that use sight-based analogies for teaching and research across subjects such as science and the humanities.

===Religion===
====Catholicism====
The Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 taught: &quot;For between creator and creature there can be noted no similarity so great that a greater dissimilarity cannot be seen between them.&quot;

The theological exploration of this subject is called the &quot;analogia entis&quot;. The consequence of this theory is that all true statements concerning God (excluding the concrete details of Jesus&#x27; earthly life) are rough analogies, without implying any falsehood. Such analogical and true statements would include &quot;God is&quot;, &quot;God is Love&quot;, &quot;God is a consuming fire&quot;, &quot;God is near to all who call him&quot;, or God as Trinity, where &quot;being&quot;, &quot;love&quot;, &quot;fire&quot;, &quot;distance&quot;, &quot;number&quot; must be classed as analogies that allow human cognition of what is infinitely beyond positive or negative language.

The use of theological statements in syllogisms must take into account their analogical essence, in that every analogy breaks down when stretched beyond its intended meaning.

====Doctrine of the Trinity====
In traditional Christian doctrine, the Trinity is a Mystery of Faith that has been revealed, not something obvious or derivable from first principles or found in any thing in the created world. Because of this, the use of analogies to understand the Trinity is common and perhaps necessary.

The Trinity is a combination of the words “tri,” meaning “three,” and “unity,” meaning “one.” The “Threeness” refers to the persons of the Trinity, while the “Oneness” refers to substance or being.

Medieval Cistercian monk Bernard of Clairveaux used the analogy of a kiss:

Many analogies have been used to explain the Trinity, however, all analogies fail when taken too far. Examples of these are the analogies that state that the Trinity is like water and its different states (solid, liquid, gas) or like an egg with its different parts (shell, yolk, and egg white). However, these analogies, if taken too far, could teach the heresies of modalism (water states) and partialism (parts of egg), which are contrary to the Christian understanding of the Trinity.

Other analogies exist. The analogy of notes of a chord, say C major, is a sufficient analogy for the Trinity. The notes C, E, and G individually fill the whole of the “heard” space, but when all notes come together, we have a homogenized sound within the same space with distinctive, equal notes. One more analogy used is one that uses the mythological dog, Cerberus, that guards the gates of Hades. While the dog itself is a single organism—speaking to its substance—Cerberus has different centers of awareness due to its three heads, each of which has the same dog nature.

====Protestantism====
In some Protestant theology, &quot;analogy&quot; may itself be used analogously in terms, more in a sense of &quot;rule&quot; or &quot;exemplar&quot;: for example the concept &quot;analogia fidei&quot; has been proposed as an alternative to the concept &quot;analogia entis&quot; but named analogously.

==== Islam ====

Islamic jurisprudence makes ample use of analogy as a means of making conclusions from outside sources of law. The bounds and rules employed to make analogical deduction vary greatly between madhhabs and to a lesser extent individual scholars. It is nonetheless a generally accepted source of law within jurisprudential epistemology, with the chief opposition to it forming the dhahiri (ostensiblist) school.

<text>Jerboas () are the members of the family Dipodidae. They are hopping desert rodents found throughout North Africa and Asia. They tend to live in hot deserts.

When chased, jerboas can run at up to . Some species are preyed on by little owls (&quot;Athene noctua&quot;) in central Asia. Most species of jerboas have excellent hearing that they use to avoid becoming the prey of nocturnal predators. The typical lifespan of a jerboa is around 2–3 years.

==Taxonomy==
Jerboas, as previously defined, were thought to be paraphyletic, with the jumping mice (Zapodidae) and birch mice (Sminthidae) also being classified in the family Dipodidae. However, phylogenetic analysis split all three as distinct families, leaving just the jerboas in Dipodidae and revealing them to be a monophyletic group.

This animal has a body length (including the head) of between 4 and 26 cm (1.6 to 10 in.), with an additional 7 – 30 cm (2.75 to 12 in.) of tail, which is always longer than the full body.

Jerboa dental records reveal a slow increase in crown heights and that corresponds to a more open and dryer ecosystem.

==Anatomy and body features==
Jerboas look somewhat like miniature kangaroos, and have some external similarities. Both have long hind legs, short forelegs, and long tails. Jerboas move around in a similar manner to kangaroos, which is by hopping, or saltation. However, their anatomy is more attuned towards erratic hopping locomotion, making use of sharp turns and great vertical leaps to confuse and escape predators, rather than for sustained hopping over long periods of time. Researchers have found that, when jerboas execute their vertical leaps, the primary tendons in the hindlimbs only recovered and reused on average 4.4% of energy contributed to the jump; this is lower than many hopping animals.

Jerboas have metatarsal bones that are fused into one long bone, called the cannon bone. Their cannon bone is more distinct and defined than in other rodents. This acts as leverage to allow them to reach higher heights while jumping, while also supporting the legs. Their back legs are often up to four times as long as the front legs. This further allows them to sling-shot themselves into the air. Jerboas that live in sandy desert environments develop hairs on the bottom of their feet that allow for better traction and grip so that they don&#x27;t slip in the sand.

Like other bipedal animals, their foramen magnum—the hole at the base of the skull—is forward-shifted, which enhances two-legged locomotion. The tail of a jerboa can be longer than its head and body, and a white cluster of hair is commonly seen at the end of the tail. Jerboas use their tails to balance when hopping, and as a prop when sitting upright. Jerboa fur is fine, and usually the colour of sand. This colour usually matches the jerboa habitat (an example of cryptic colouration). Some species of the jerboa family have long ears like a rabbit, whilst others have ears that are short like those of a mouse or rat.

In addition to the Jerboa&#x27;s large ears, they also have large feet which are a result of multiple genes overlapping each other in their DNA. Researchers found a gene called the &quot;shox2&quot; gene that is expressed in Jerboa feet. This gene has the ability to turn other genes on and off and has been seen to cause mutant limbs.

==Behavior==
The bipedal locomotion of jerboas involves hopping, skipping, and running gaits, associated with rapid and frequent, difficult-to-predict changes in speed and direction, facilitating predator evasion relative to quadrupedal locomotion. This may explain why evolution of bipedal locomotion is favored in desert-dwelling rodents that forage in open habitats.

Jerboas can hop normally but if threatened by a predator the Jerboa can jump up to .

Jerboas are most active at twilight (crepuscular). During the heat of the day, they shelter in burrows. At night, they leave the burrows due to the cooler temperature of their environment. They dig the entrances to their burrow near plant life, especially along field borders. During the rainy season, they make tunnels in mounds or hills to reduce the risk of flooding. In the summer, jerboas occupying holes plug the entrance to keep out hot air and, some researchers speculate, predators. In most cases, burrows are constructed with an emergency exit that ends just below the surface or opens at the surface but is not strongly obstructed. This allows the jerboa to quickly escape predators.

Since Jerboas dig in the sand, they have adapted to that environment by developing skin folds and hair that protects their ears and nose from getting sand inside them.

Related jerboas often create four types of burrows. A temporary, summer day burrow is used for cover while hunting during the daylight. They have a second, temporary burrow used for hunting at night. They also have two permanent burrows: one for summer and one for winter. The permanent summer burrow is actively used throughout the summer and the young are raised there. Jerboas hibernate during the winter and use the permanent winter burrow for this. Temporary burrows are shorter in length than permanent burrows. Just like other animals that hibernate, these creatures are heavier pre-hibernation specifically in ungrazed sites (Shuai). Also, more food availability during pre-hibernation contributes to larger jerboa body mass in ungrazed regions, and entices more jerboas to migrate to ungrazed areas during post-hibernation. Grazing negatively impacts the Jerboa pre- and post-hibernation population, but not the survival rate.

Jerboas create burrows to function as protection against predators and severe weather conditions. They will naturally respond to winter conditions such as cold temperatures and food deprivation by digging a winter burrow to hibernate in. Winter burrows are most often longer, deeper and have more entrance holes than summer burrows. Additionally, they use these burrows as nesting areas to raise their young. They can also function as feeding sites.

Jerboas are solitary creatures. Once they reach adulthood, they usually have their own burrow and search for food on their own. However, occasional &quot;loose colonies&quot; may form, whereby some species of jerboa dig communal burrows that offer extra warmth when it is cold outside.

==Diet==
Most jerboas rely on plant material as the main component of their diet, but they cannot eat hard seeds. Some species opportunistically eat other jerboas and other animals they come across. Unlike gerbils, jerboas are not known to store their food.

Some species of Jerboa are known to have a diet that consists of insects, plants, and sometimes seeds. They use their two front legs to gather food.

Jerboas do not drink water but instead get their water intake from the food they eat. Jerboas like desert plants; they are best when they are wet but when dried out the Jerboas will dig the plants up and eat the roots because that part of the plant holds the most water. Jerboas will also try to minimize water loss by feeding at night when it is cooler in the desert.

==Communication and perception==
Many species within the family Dipodidae engage in dust bathing, often a way to use chemical communication. Their keen hearing suggests they may use sounds or vibrations to communicate.

==Reproduction==
Mating systems of closely related species in the family Dipodidae suggest that they may be polygynous. For some closely related jerboa species, mating usually happens a short time after awaking from winter hibernation. A female breeds twice in the summer, and raises from two to six young. Gestation time is between 25 and 35 days. Little is known about parental investment in long-eared jerboas. Like most mammals, females nurse and care for their young at least until they are weaned.

Food conditions become abundant typically in the spring and summer. This is also when reproduction rates in the jerboas increase. Jerboas have cells that produce sex hormones known as the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). These cells fire the most in the months of March through July. These cells quit producing GnRH in the autumn, and the jerboa&#x27;s mating season ends.

<text>Jiles Perry Richardson Jr. (October 24, 1930 – February 3, 1959), better known by his stage name The Big Bopper, was an American musician and disc jockey. His best-known compositions include &quot;Chantilly Lace,&quot; &quot;Running Bear&quot;, and &quot;White Lightning&quot;, the latter of which became George Jones&#x27;s first number-one hit in 1959. 

Richardson was killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa, in February 1959, along with fellow musicians Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens, and the pilot, Roger Peterson.

== Early life ==
Richardson was born on October 24, 1930, in Sabine Pass, Texas, the oldest son of oil-field worker Jiles Perry Richardson (1905–84) and his wife Elise (née Stalsby) Richardson (1909–83). They had two other sons, Cecil (1934–89) and James (1932–2010). The family soon moved to Beaumont, Texas. Richardson graduated from Beaumont High School in 1947 and played on the &quot;Royal Purple&quot; American football team as a defensive lineman, wearing number 85. Richardson later was a radio disc jockey while at Lamar College, where he studied prelaw and was a member of the band and chorus.

== Career ==
=== Radio ===
Richardson worked part-time at Beaumont, Texas radio station KTRM (now KZZB). He was hired by the station full-time in 1949 and quit college. Richardson married Adrianne Joy Fryou on April 18, 1952, and their daughter Debra Joy was born in December 1953, soon after Richardson was promoted to supervisor of announcers at KTRM. In March 1955, he was drafted into the United States Army and did his basic training at Fort Ord, California. Richardson spent the rest of his two-year service as a radar instructor at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. In March 1957, following his discharge as a corporal, Richardson returned to KTRM radio, where he held down the &quot;Dishwashers&#x27; Serenade&quot; shift from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., Monday to Friday.

One of the station&#x27;s sponsors wanted Richardson for a new time slot, and suggested an idea for a show. Richardson had seen college students doing a dance called The Bop, and he decided to call himself &quot;The Big Bopper&quot;. His new radio show ran from 3:00 to 6:00 p.m., and he soon became the station&#x27;s program director. In May 1957, Richardson broke the record for continuous on-air broadcasting by eight minutes. He performed for a total of five days, two hours, and eight minutes from a remote setup in the lobby of the Jefferson Theatre in downtown Beaumont, playing 1,821 records and taking showers during five-minute newscasts. Richardson is credited for creating the first music video in 1958, and recorded an early example himself.

=== Singer and songwriter ===
Richardson, who played guitar, began his musical career as a songwriter. George Jones later recorded Richardson&#x27;s &quot;White Lightning&quot;, which became Jones&#x27;s first No. 1 country hit in 1959 (#73 on the pop charts). Richardson also wrote &quot;Running Bear&quot; for Johnny Preston, his friend from Port Arthur, Texas. The inspiration for the song came from Richardson&#x27;s childhood memory of the Sabine River, where he heard stories about Indian tribes. Preston&#x27;s recording was not released until August 1959, six months after Richardson&#x27;s death. The song became a No. 1 hit for three weeks in January 1960. The man who launched Richardson as a recording artist was Harold &quot;Pappy&quot; Daily from Houston. Daily was promotion director for Mercury and Starday Records and signed Richardson to Mercury. Richardson&#x27;s first single, &quot;Beggar to a King&quot;, had a country flavor, but failed to gain any chart action.

Richardson soon cut &quot;Chantilly Lace&quot; as &quot;The Big Bopper&quot; for Pappy Daily&#x27;s D label. Mercury bought the recording and released it at the end of June 1958. It slowly began picking up airplay through July and August, and reached No. 6 on the pop chart spending 22 weeks in the national Top 40. The disc sold in excess of one million copies by the end of 1958 and was awarded a gold disc. In &quot;Chantilly Lace&quot;, Richardson pretends to have a flirting phone conversation with his girlfriend; the record was comical in nature, with The Big Bopper presenting an exaggerated, but good-natured caricature of a ladies&#x27; man. In November 1958, he scored a second hit, a raucous novelty tune entitled &quot;The Big Bopper&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, in which Richardson pretends to be getting cold feet at the altar. Both &quot;Chantilly Lace&quot; and &quot;Big Bopper&#x27;s Wedding&quot; were receiving top 40 radio airplay through January 1959.

C3 Entertainment handles the rights to the Richardson estate, through an agreement with Jay&#x27;s widow Patty.

== Personal life ==
Richardson was married to Adrianne Joy &quot;Teetsie&quot; Richardson Wenner (1936–2004) and had a daughter, Debra (1953–2006). His son, Jay Perry Richardson, was born two months after his death, in April 1959. Richardson had been building a recording studio in his home in Beaumont, Texas, and was planning to invest in a radio station. Richardson had written 20 new songs that he planned to record himself or with other artists.

Jay Perry Richardson also followed a musical career and was known professionally as &quot;The Big Bopper, Jr.&quot;, performing around the world. He toured on the &quot;Winter Dance Party&quot; tour with Buddy Holly impersonator John Mueller on some of the same stages where his father had performed.

=== Internet rumors, exhumation and reburial in 2007 ===

In January 2007, Richardson&#x27;s son Jay requested that his father&#x27;s body be exhumed and an autopsy be performed in response to an internet rumor about guns being fired aboard the aircraft and Richardson initially surviving the crash. The autopsy was performed by William M. Bass, a forensic anthropologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Richardson was present throughout the autopsy and observed the casket as it was opened; both men were surprised that the remains were well enough preserved to be recognized as those of the late rock star. &quot;Dad still amazes me 48 years after his death, that he was in remarkable shape,&quot; Richardson told the Associated Press. &quot;I surprised myself. I handled it better than I thought I would.&quot; Bass&#x27;s findings indicated no signs of foul play. &quot;There are fractures from head to toe. Massive fractures…. [Richardson] died immediately. He didn&#x27;t crawl away. He didn&#x27;t walk away from the plane.&quot;

Richardson&#x27;s body was placed in a new casket made by the same company as the original and was reburied next to his wife in Beaumont&#x27;s Forest Lawn Cemetery. His son Jay Richardson allowed the old casket to be displayed at the Texas Musicians Museum. In December 2008, he announced that he would be placing the old casket up for auction on eBay, donating a share of the proceeds to the Texas Musicians Museum, but Jay downplayed the suggestion in later interviews. He died of heart failure in 2013.
The family announced &quot;It is with great sadness that we must tell you that Jay P Richardson has passed away. After a long hard fight, JP succumbed on the morning of August 21, at the age of 54&quot;.

== Death ==
With the success of &quot;Chantilly Lace&quot;, Richardson took time off from KTRM radio and joined Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and Dion and the Belmonts for a &quot;Winter Dance Party&quot; tour starting on January 23, 1959. On the 11th night of the tour (February 2, 1959), they played at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa. That night, Holly chartered an airplane from Dwyer Flying Service in Mason City, Iowa, intending to fly himself and his bandmates Waylon Jennings and Tommy Allsup to their next tour venue in Moorhead, Minnesota. The musicians had been traveling by bus for over a week, and it had already broken down twice. They were tired, they had not been paid yet, and all of their clothes were dirty. The chartered flight would allow them to avoid another arduous bus ride, arrive early before the Moorhead show, do their laundry, and get some rest. Local pilot Roger Peterson of Dwyer Flying Service (age 21) had agreed to take them. The weather forecast for the Clear Lake area was that night with moderate gusty winds and light scattered snow, and Peterson was fatigued from a 17-hour workday, but he agreed to fly the trip.

Frankie Sardo went to meet the crowd while Holly went into one of the dressing rooms at the Surf Ballroom where he notified Allsup and Jennings that he had chartered a plane to take them to Fargo, North Dakota (which is directly adjacent to Moorhead, Minnesota). On a friendly wager, Valens flipped a coin with Allsup for his seat on the plane—and won. Meanwhile, J.P. Richardson was suffering from the flu and was complaining that the bus was too cold and uncomfortable for him, so Jennings voluntarily surrendered his seat. Upon hearing that his bandmates had given away their plane seats, Holly joked, &quot;Well, I hope your ol&#x27; bus freezes up again.&quot; Jennings jokingly replied, &quot;Well, I hope your ol&#x27; plane crashes.&quot;

The Clear Lake show ended at around midnight and Holly, Valens, and Richardson drove to the Mason City Airport, loaded their luggage and boarded the red and white single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza. Peterson received clearance from the control tower around 12:55 a.m. on February 3, 1959, and they took off—but the plane remained airborne for only a few minutes. It crashed at full throttle shortly after takeoff about 5 miles outside Mason City in the middle of farm country. The reason remains unknown but Peterson may have lost his visual reference and thought that he was ascending while he was actually descending. The right wingtip of the Bonanza hit the frozen ground and sent the aircraft cartwheeling across a cleared cornfield at approximately .

Holly, Valens and Richardson were thrown from the airplane on impact and likely tumbled along with the wreckage across the icy field before the wreckage of the aircraft came to rest against a barbed-wire fence, while Peterson&#x27;s body remained entangled in the wreckage. The bodies of Holly and Valens came to rest several feet away from the wreckage on open ground; Richardson was thrown approximately beyond the wreckage across the fence line and into the next cornfield. All three died instantly of head and chest injuries. Richardson was 28 years old.

== Tributes ==

In 1988, Ken Paquette, a Wisconsin fan of the 1950s era, erected a stainless steel monument at the crash site depicting a guitar and a set of three records bearing the names of each of the three performers. It is located on private farmland, about one-quarter-mile west of the intersection of 315th Street and Gull Avenue, about eight miles north of Clear Lake. Paquette also created a similar stainless steel monument to the three near the Riverside Ballroom in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The memorial was unveiled on July 17, 2003.

J.P. Richardson&#x27;s pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. The Big Bopper is fondly remembered not only for his distinctive singing and songwriting, but also as a humorist who combined the best elements of country, R&amp;B, and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.

In 2010, Richardson was inducted into the Iowa Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Hall of Fame.

Richardson&#x27;s name is mentioned as one of the upcoming musical acts in both the print and television versions of Stephen King&#x27;s short story &quot;You Know They Got a Hell of a Band&quot; about a town inhabited by late musical legends. Buddy Holly is subsequently featured in the story.

The Canadian television comedy show &quot;SCTV&quot; featured a character named &quot;Sue Bopper-Simpson&quot;, a fictional daughter of the Big Bopper, played by Catherine O&#x27;Hara. The character was a part-time real estate agent who appeared in a musical titled &quot;I&#x27;m Taking My Own Head, Screwing It on Right, and No Guy&#x27;s Gonna Tell Me That It Ain&#x27;t&quot;.

Shortly after the fatal plane crash, Tommy Dee wrote and recorded a song titled &quot;Three Stars&quot; in tribute to Richardson, Holly, and Valens. It was later recorded by Eddie Cochran, a friend of the three musicians who himself would die prematurely a year later in an automobile crash.

The accident was referred to as &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot; in Don McLean&#x27;s 1971 song &quot;American Pie&quot;.

Van Halen&#x27;s song &quot;Good Enough&quot; from their 1986 album &quot;5150&quot; begins with singer Sammy Hagar calling out &quot;Hello Baby!&quot;, imitating the Big Bopper&#x27;s hook in &quot;Chantilly Lace&quot;. Phil Lewis of L.A. Guns does the same in their song &quot;17 Crash&quot; from their 1989 album &quot;Cocked &amp; Loaded&quot;.

The &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Sideshow Bob Roberts&quot; features a gravestone of The Big Bopper in Springfield that Sideshow Bob (Kelsey Grammer) used to help commit voter fraud and become elected for mayor. The gravestone is a bust of the Big Bopper holding a telephone receiver, with the epitaph reading &quot;The Big Bopper&quot;, his birth and death years (1930–1959), then a parody on the memorable hook reading &quot;Gooooodbye, baby&quot;. He also appeared as a vampire holding a telephone in an &quot;Itchy and Scratchy&quot; cartoon during the episode &quot;C.E.D&#x27;oh&quot;.

An episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; entitled &quot;Clyde Bruckman&#x27;s Final Repose&quot; alludes to the deaths of Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper. The episode&#x27;s title character, played by Peter Boyle, explains that he had a ticket to see them perform the night after they died and received the psychic ability to predict people&#x27;s deaths by calculating the odds that it took for the Big Bopper to be on the flight that killed him.

The Big Bopper&#x27;s estate is currently owned by his daughter-in-law, Patty Richardson, and managed by C3 Entertainment, a company that specializes in classic brands. C3 Entertainment currently manages an official tribute band featuring a Big Bopper impersonator, touring with the Winter Dance Party. In 2019, the Winter Dance Party debuted the film &quot;Bopper and Me.&quot;

== Book, film, and stage ==
In &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, a turbulent road novel taking place at the end of the fifties, Jim Dodge narrates an eventful trip to the Big Bopper&#x27;s grave.

Richardson was portrayed by Gailard Sartain in &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot;, Stephen Lee in &quot;La Bamba&quot;, and John Ennis in &quot;Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story&quot;.

&quot;Chantilly Lace&quot; is used in the movies &quot;True Romance&quot; and &quot;American Graffiti&quot; as well as &quot;High Spirits&quot; and &quot;Cocktail&quot;.

In the animated series &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot;, it is implied that the elderly villains Dragoon and Red Mantle are actually Richardson and Buddy Holly, who were recruited into the supervillain organization the Guild of Calamitous Intent on the night of their supposed deaths.

<text>The Doge&#x27;s Palace (&quot;Doge&quot; pronounced ; ; ) is a palace built in Venetian Gothic style, and one of the main landmarks of the city of Venice in northern Italy. The palace included government offices, a jail, and the residence of the Doge of Venice, the elected authority of the former Republic of Venice. It was originally built in 810, rebuilt in 1340 and extended and modified in the following centuries. It became a museum in 1923 and is one of the 11 museums run by the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia.

==History==
In 810, Doge Agnello Participazio moved the seat of government from the island of Malamocco to the area of the present-day Rialto, when it was decided a &quot;palatium duci&quot; (Latin for &quot;ducal palace&quot;) should be built. However, no trace remains of that 9th-century building as the palace was partially destroyed in the 10th century by a fire set by citizens rebelling against Doge Pietro IV Candiano. The following reconstruction works were undertaken at the behest of Doge Sebastiano Ziani (1172–1178). A great reformer, he would drastically change the entire layout of the St. Mark&#x27;s Square. The new palace was built out of fortresses, one façade to the Piazzetta, the other overlooking the St. Mark&#x27;s Basin. Although only few traces remain of that palace, some Byzantine-Venetian architecture characteristics can still be seen at the ground floor, with the wall base in Istrian stone and some herring-bone pattern brick paving.

Political changes in the mid-13th century led to the need to re-think the palace&#x27;s structure due to the considerable increase in the number of the Great Council&#x27;s members. The new Gothic palace&#x27;s constructions started around 1340, focusing mostly on the side of the building facing the lagoon. Only in 1424 did Doge Francesco Foscari decide to extend the rebuilding works to the wing overlooking the Piazzetta, serving as law-courts, and with a ground-floor arcade on the outside, open first-floor loggias running along the façade, and the internal courtyard side of the wing, completed with the construction of the Porta della Carta (1442).

In 1483, a violent fire broke out in the side of the palace overlooking the canal, where the Doge&#x27;s Apartments were. Once again, an important reconstruction became necessary and was commissioned from Antonio Rizzo, who would introduce the new Renaissance language to the building&#x27;s architecture. An entire new structure was raised alongside the canal, stretching from the Ponte della Canonica to the Ponte della Paglia, with the official rooms of the government decorated with works commissioned from Vittore Carpaccio, Giorgione, Alvise Vivarini and Giovanni Bellini.

Another huge fire in 1547 destroyed some of the rooms on the second floor, but fortunately without undermining the structure as a whole. Refurbishment works were being held at the palace when in 1577 a third fire destroyed the Scrutinio Room and the Great Council Chamber, together with works by Gentile da Fabriano, Pisanello, Alvise Vivarini, Vittore Carpaccio, Giovanni Bellini, Pordenone, and Titian. In the subsequent rebuilding work it was decided to respect the original Gothic style, despite the submission of neo-classical alternative designs by the influential Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio. However, there are some classical features – for example, since the 16th century, the palace has been linked to the prison by the Bridge of Sighs.

As well as being the ducal residence, the palace housed political institutions of the Republic of Venice until the Napoleonic occupation of the city in 1797, when its role inevitably changed. Venice was subjected first to French rule, then to Austrian, and finally in 1866 it became part of Italy. Over this period, the palace was occupied by various administrative offices as well as housing the Biblioteca Marciana and other important cultural institutions within the city.
By the end of the 19th century, the structure was showing clear signs of decay, and the Italian government set aside significant funds for its restoration and all public offices were moved elsewhere, with the exception of the State Office for the Protection of Historical Monuments, which is still housed at the palace&#x27;s loggia floor. In 1923, the Italian State, owner of the building, entrusted the management to the Venetian municipality to be run as a museum. Since 1996, the Doge&#x27;s Palace has been part of the Venetian museums network, which has been under the management of the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia since 2008.

==Description==

===Exterior===

The oldest part of the palace is the wing overlooking the lagoon, the corners of which are decorated with 14th-century sculptures, thought to be by Filippo Calendario and various Lombard artists such as Matteo Raverti and Antonio Bregno. The ground floor arcade and the loggia above are decorated with 14th- and 15th-century capitals, some of which were replaced with copies during the 19th century.

In 1438–1442, Giovanni Bon and Bartolomeo Bon built and adorned the Porta della Carta, which served as the ceremonial entrance to the building. The name of the gateway probably derives either from the fact that this was the area where public scribes set up their desks, or from the nearby location of the &quot;cartabum&quot;, the archives of state documents. Flanked by Gothic pinnacles, with two figures of the &quot;Cardinal Virtues&quot; per side, the gateway is crowned by a bust of Mark the Evangelist over which rises a statue of &quot;Justice&quot; with her traditional symbols of sword and scales. In the space above the cornice, there is a sculptural portrait of the Doge Francesco Foscari kneeling before the Lion of Saint Mark. This is, however, a 19th-century work by Luigi Ferrari, created to replace the original destroyed in 1797.

Today, the public entrance to the Doge&#x27;s Palace is via the Porta del Frumento, on the waterfront side of the building.

===Courtyard===
The north side of the courtyard is closed by the junction between the palace and St Mark&#x27;s Basilica, which used to be the Doge&#x27;s chapel. At the centre of the courtyard stand two well-heads dating from the mid-16th century.

In 1485, the Great Council decided that a ceremonial staircase should be built within the courtyard. The design envisaged a straight axis with the rounded Foscari Arch, with alternate bands of Istrian stone and red Verona marble, linking the staircase to the Porta della Carta, and thus producing one single monumental approach from the Piazza into the heart of the building. Since 1567, the Giants&#x27; Staircase is guarded by Sansovino&#x27;s two colossal statues of &quot;Mars&quot; and &quot;Neptune&quot;, which represents Venice&#x27;s power by land and by sea, and therefore the reason for its name. Members of the Senate gathered before government meetings in the Senator&#x27;s Courtyard, to the right of the Giants&#x27; Staircase.

=== Museo dell&#x27;Opera ===
Over the centuries, the Doge&#x27;s Palace has been restructured and restored countless times. Due to fires, structural failures, and infiltrations, and new organizational requirements and modifications or complete overhaulings of the ornamental trappings there was hardly a moment in which some kind of works have not been underway at the building. From the Middle Ages, the activities of maintenance and conservation were in the hands of a &quot;technical office&quot;, which was in charge of all such operations and oversaw the workers and their sites: the &quot;Opera&quot;, or &quot;fabbriceria&quot; or &quot;procuratoria&quot;. After the mid-19th century, the palace seemed to be in such a state of decay that its very survival was in question; thus, in 1876 a major restoration plan was launched. The work involved the two facades and the capitals belonging to the ground-floor arcade and the upper loggia: 42 of these, which appeared to be in an especially dilapidated state, were removed and replaced by copies. The originals, some of which were masterpieces of Venetian sculpture of the 14th and 15th centuries, were placed, together with other sculptures from the facades, in an area specifically set aside for this purpose: the Museo dell&#x27;Opera. After undergoing thorough and careful restoration works, they are now exhibited, on their original columns, in these six rooms of the museum, which are traversed by an ancient wall in great blocks of stone, a remnant of an earlier version of the palace. The rooms also contain fragments of statues and important architectural and decorative works in stone from the facades of the palace.

===Doge&#x27;s apartments===
The rooms in which the Doge lived were always located in this area of the palace, between the Rio della Canonica – the water entrance to the building – the present-day Golden Staircase and the apse of St. Mark&#x27;s Basilica. The disastrous fire in this part of the building in 1483 made important reconstruction work necessary, with the Doge&#x27;s apartments being completed by 1510. The core of these apartments forms a prestigious, though not particularly large, residence, given that the rooms nearest the Golden Staircase had a mixed private and public function. In the private apartments, the Doge could set aside the trappings of office to retire at the end of the day and dine with members of his family amidst furnishings that he had brought from his own house (and which, at his death, would be promptly removed to make way for the property of the new elected Doge).
* The Scarlet Chamber possibly takes its name from the colour of the robes worn by the Ducal advisors and counsellors for whom it was the antechamber. The carved ceiling, adorned with the armorial bearings of Doge Andrea Gritti, is part of the original décor, probably designed by Biagio and Pietro da Faenza. Amongst the wall decoration, two frescoed lunettes are particular worthy of attention: one by Giuseppe Salviati, the other by Titian.
* The &quot;Scudo&quot; Room has this name from the coat-of-arms of the reigning Doge which was exhibited here while he granted audiences and received guests. The coat-of-arms currently on display is that of Ludovico Manin, the Doge reigning when the Republic of St. Mark came to an end in 1797. This is the largest room in the Doge&#x27;s apartments and runs the entire width of this wing of the palace. The hall was used as a reception chamber and its decoration with large geographical maps was designed to underline the glorious tradition that was at the very basis of Venetian power. The two globes in the centre of the hall date from the same period: one shows the sphere of the heavens, the other the surface of Earth.
* The Erizzo Room owes its name to Doge Francesco Erizzo (1631–1646) and is decorated in the same way as the preceding ones: a carved wood ceiling, with gilding against a light-blue background, and a Lombardy-school fireplace. From here, a small staircase leads up to a window that gave access to a roof garden.
*The Stucchi or Priùli Room has a double name due to both the stucco works that adorn the vault and lunettes, dating from the period of Doge Marino Grimani (1595–1605), and the presence of the armorial bearings of Doge Antonio Priuli (1618–1623), which are to be seen on the fireplace, surmounted by allegorical figures. The stucco-works on the walls and ceiling were later commissioned by another Doge Pietro Grimani (1741–1752). Various paintings representing the life of Jesus Christ are present in this room, as well as a portrait of King Henry III of France (perhaps by Tintoretto) due to his visit to the city in 1574 on his way from Poland to take up the French throne left vacant with the death of his brother Charles IX.
* Directly linked to the Shield Hall, the Philosophers&#x27; Room takes its name from the twelve pictures of ancient philosophers which were set up here in the 18th century, to be later replaced with allegorical works and portraits of Doges. To the left, a small doorway leads to a narrow staircase, which enabled the Doge to pass rapidly from his own apartments to the halls on the upper floors, where the meetings of the Senate and the Great Council were held. Above the other side of this doorway, there is an important fresco of &quot;St. Christopher&quot; by Titian.
* The Corner Room&#x27;s name comes from the presence of various paintings depicting Doge Giovanni Corner (1625–1629). The fireplace, made out of Carrara marble, is decorated with a frieze of winged angels on dolphins around a central figure of St. Mark&#x27;s Lion. Like the following room, this served no specific function; set aside for the private use of the Doge.
* The Equerries Room was the main access to the Doge&#x27;s private apartments. The palace equerries were appointed for life by the Doge himself and had to be at his disposal at any time.

=== Institutional chambers ===

* The Square Atrium served as a waiting room, the antechamber to various halls. The decoration dates from the 16th century, during the reign of Doge Girolamo Priuli (1486–1567), who appears in Tintoretto&#x27;s ceiling painting with the symbols of his office, and accompanied by scenes of biblical stories and allegories of the four seasons, probably by Tintoretto&#x27;s workshop, Girolamo Bassano and Veronese.
* The Four Doors Room was the formal antechamber to the more important rooms in the palace, and the doors which give it its name are ornately framed in precious Eastern marbles; each is surmounted by an allegorical sculptural group that refers to the virtues which should inspire those who took on the government responsibilities. The present decoration is a work by Antonio da Ponte and design by Andrea Palladio and Giovan Antonio Rusconi. Painted by Tintoretto from 1578 onwards, the frescoes of mythological subjects and of the cities and regions under Venetian dominion were designed to show a close link between Venice&#x27;s foundation, its independence, and the historical mission of the Venetian aristocracy. Amongst the paintings on the walls, one that stands out is Titian&#x27;s portrait of Doge Antonio Grimani (1521–1523). On the easel stands a painting by Tiepolo portraying Venice receiving the gifts of the sea from Neptune.

* Antechamber to the Hall of the Full College was the formal antechamber where foreign ambassadors and delegations waited to be received by the Full College, delegated by the Senate to deal with foreign affairs. This room was restored after the 1574 fire and so was its decorations, with stucco-works and ceiling frescoes. The central fresco by Veronese shows Venice distributing honours and rewards. The top of the walls is decorated with a fine frieze and other sumptuous fittings, including the fireplace between the windows and the fine doorway leading into the Hall of the Full College, whose Corinthian columns bear a pediment surmounted by a marble sculpture showing the female figure of Venice resting on a lion and accompanied by allegories of Glory and Concord. Next to the doorways are four canvases that Tintoretto painted for the Square Atrium, but which were brought here in 1716 to replace the original leather wall panelling. Each of the mythological scenes depicted is also an allegory of the Republic&#x27;s government.
*The Council Chamber: the Full College was mainly responsible for organizing and coordinating the work of the Venetian Senate, reading dispatches from ambassadors and city governors, receiving foreign delegations and promoting other political and legislative activity. Alongside these shared functions, each body had its own particular mandates, which made this body a sort of &quot;guiding intelligence&quot; behind the work of the Senate, especially in foreign affairs. The decorations were designed by Andrea Palladio to replace those destroyed in the 1574 fire; the wood panelling of the walls and end tribune and the carved ceiling are the work of Francesco Bello and . The paintings in the ceiling were commissioned from Veronese, who completed them between 1575 and 1578. This ceiling is one of the artist&#x27;s masterpieces and celebrates the Good Government of the Republic, together with the Faith on which it rests and the Virtues that guide and strengthen it. Other paintings are by Tintoretto and show various Doges with Christ, the Virgin and saints.
* The Senate Chamber was also known as the Sala dei Pregadi because the Doge asked the members of the Senate to take part in the meetings held here. The Senate which met in this chamber was one of the oldest public institutions in Venice; it had first been founded in the 13th century and then gradually evolved over time, until by the 16th century it was the body mainly responsible for overseeing political and financial affairs in such areas as manufacturing industries, trade and foreign policy. In the works produced for this room by Tintoretto, Christ is clearly the predominant figure; perhaps a reference to the Senate &quot;conclave&quot; which elected the Doge, seen as being under the protection of the Son of God. The room also contains four paintings by Jacopo Palma il Giovane, which are linked with specific events of Venetian history.
* The Chamber of the Council of Ten takes its name from the Council of Ten which was set up after a conspiracy in 1310, when Bajamonte Tiepolo and other noblemen tried to overthrow the institutions of the State. The ceiling decoration is a work by Gian Battista Ponchino, with the assistance of a young Veronese and Gian Battista Zelotti. Carved and gilded, the ceiling is divided into 25 compartments decorated with images of divinities and allegories intended to illustrate the power of the Council of Ten that was responsible for punishing the guilty and freeing the innocent.
* The Compass Room is dedicated to the administration of justice; its name comes from the large wooden compass surmounted by a statue of Justice, which stands in one corner and hides the entrance to the rooms of the Three Heads of the Council of Ten and the State Inquisitors. This room was the antechamber where those who had been summoned by these powerful magistrates waited to be called and the decoration was intended to underline the solemnity of the Republic&#x27;s legal machinery, dating from the 16th century. The ceiling paintings are by Veronese and the large fireplace was designed by Sansovino. From this room, one can pass to the Armoury and the New Prisons, on the other side of the Bridge of Sighs, or go straight down the Censors&#x27; Staircase to pass into the rooms housing the councils of justice on the first floor.
* In the Venetian language, &quot;Liagò&quot; means a terrace or balcony enclosed by glass. This particular example was a sort of corridor and meeting place for patrician members of the Great Council in the intervals between their discussions of government business.
* The Chamber of Quarantia Civil Vecchia: originally a single 40-man-council which wielded substantial political and legislative power, the Quarantia was during the course of the 15th century divided into three separate councils. This room was restored in the 17th century; the fresco fragment to the right of the entrance is the only remnant of the original decorations.
* The Guariento Room&#x27;s name is due to the fact it houses a fresco painted by the Paduan artist Guariento around 1365. Almost completely destroyed in the 1577 fire, the remains of that fresco were, in 1903, rediscovered under the large canvas &quot;Il Paradiso&quot; which Tintoretto was commissioned to paint.

* Restructured in the 14th century, the Chamber of the Great Council was decorated with a fresco by Guariento and later with works by the most famous artists of the period, including Gentile da Fabriano, Pisanello, Alvise Vivarini, Vittore Carpaccio, Giovanni Bellini, Pordenone and Titian, along with a 1582 ceiling painting of &quot;The Triumph of Venice, Crowned by Victory&quot; by Palma il Giovane and the 1585 &quot;Apotheosis of Venice&quot; by Veronese. 53 meters long and 25 meters wide, this is not only the largest chamber in the Doge&#x27;s Palace but also one of the largest rooms in Europe. Here, meetings of the Great Council were held, the most important political body in the Republic. A very ancient institution, this Council was made up of all the male members of patrician Venetian families over 25 years old, irrespective of their individual status, merits or wealth. This was why, in spite of the restrictions in its powers that the Senate introduced over the centuries, the Great Council continued to be seen as a bastion of Republican equality. Soon after work on the new hall had been completed, the 1577 fire damaged not only this Chamber but also the Scrutinio Room. The structural damage was soon restored, respecting the original layout, and all works were finished within a few years, ending in 1579–80. The decoration of the restored structure involved artists such as Veronese, Jacopo and Domenico Tintoretto, and Palma il Giovane. The walls were decorated with episodes of the Venetian history, with particular reference to the city&#x27;s relations with the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire, while the ceiling was decorated with the Virtues and individual examples of Venetian heroism, and a central panel containing an allegorical glorification of the Republic. Facing each other in groups of six, the twelve wall paintings depict acts of valour or incidents of war that had occurred during the city&#x27;s history. Immediately below the ceiling runs a frieze with portraits of the first 76 doges (the portraits of the others are to be found in the Scrutinio Room); commissioned from Tintoretto, most of these paintings are in fact the work of his son. Each Doge holds a scroll bearing a reference to his most important achievements, while Doge Marino Faliero, who attempted a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in 1355, is represented simply by a black cloth as a traitor to the Republic. One of the long walls, behind the Doge&#x27;s throne, is occupied by the longest canvas painting in the world, &quot;Il Paradiso&quot;, which Tintoretto and his workshop produced between 1588 and 1592.
* The Scrutinio Room is in the wing built between the 1520s and 1540s during the dogate of Francesco Foscari (1423–57), facing the Piazzetta. It was initially intended to house the precious manuscripts left to the Republic by Petrarch and Bessarione (1468); indeed, it was originally known as the Library. In 1532, it was decided that the Chamber should also hold the electoral counting and/or deliberations that assiduously marked the rhythm of Venetian politics, based on an assembly system whose epicentre was the nearby Great Council Chamber. After the construction of Biblioteca Marciana though, this room was used solely for elections. The present decorations date from between 1578 and 1615, after the 1577 fire. Episodes of military history in the various compartments glorify the exploits of the Venetians, with particular emphasis on the conquest of the maritime empire; the only exception being the last oval, recording the taking of Padua in 1405.
* The Quarantia Criminale Chamber and the Cuoi Room were used for the administration of justice. The Quarantia Criminal was set up in the 15th century and dealt with cases of criminal law. It was a very important body, as its members also had legislative powers.
* The Magistrato alle Leggi Chamber housed the Magistratura dei Conservatori ed esecutori delle leggi e ordini degli uffici di San Marco e di Rialto. Created in 1553, this authority was headed by three of the city&#x27;s patricians and was responsible for making sure the regulations concerning the practice of law were observed.
* The State Censors were set up in 1517 by Marco Giovanni di Giovanni, a cousin of Doge Andrea Gritti (1523–1538) and nephew of the great Francesco Foscari. The title and duties of the Censors resulted from the cultural and political upheavals that are associated with Humanism. In fact, the Censors were not judges as such, but more like moral consultants, their main task being the suppression of electoral fraud and protection of the State&#x27;s public institutions. On the walls of the Censors&#x27; Chamber hang a number of Domenico Tintoretto&#x27;s portraits of these magistrates, and below the armorial bearings of some of those who held the position.
* The State Advocacies&#x27; Chamber is decorated with paintings representing some of the Avogadori di Común venerating the Virgin, the Christ and various saints. The three members, the Avogadori, were the figures who safeguarded the very principle of legality, making sure that the laws were applied correctly. They were also responsible for preserving the integrity of the city&#x27;s patrician class, verifying the legitimacy of marriages and births inscribed in the Golden Book.
* The &quot;Scrigno&quot; Room: the Venetian nobility as a caste came into existence because of the &quot;closure&quot; of admissions to the Great Council in 1297; however, it was only in the 16th century that formal measures were taken to introduce restrictions that protected the status of that aristocracy: marriages between nobles and commoners were forbidden and greater controls were set up to check the validity of aristocratic titles. There was also a Silver Book, which registered all those families that not only had the requisites of &quot;civilization&quot; and &quot;honour&quot;, but could also show that they were of ancient Venetian origin; such families furnished the manpower for the State bureaucracy – and particularly, the chancellery within the Doge&#x27;s Palace itself. Both books were kept in a chest in this room, inside a cupboard that also contained all the documents proving the legitimacy of claims to be inscribed therein.
* Chamber of the Navy Captains: made up of 20 members from the Senate and the Great Council, the Milizia da Mar, first set up in the mid-16th century, was responsible for recruiting crews necessary for Venice&#x27;s war galleys. Another similar body, entitled the Provveditori all&#x27;Armar, was responsible for the actual fitting and supplying of the fleet. The furnishings are from the 16th century, while the wall torches date from the 18th century.

===Old Prison or Piombi===
Prior to the 12th century, there were holding cells within the Doge&#x27;s Palace but during the 13th and fourteenth centuries more prison spaces were created to occupy the entire ground floor of the southern wing. Again these layouts changed in c.1540 when a compound of the ground floor of the eastern wing was built. Due to their dark, damp and isolated qualities they came to be known as the Pozzi (the Wells). In 1591 yet more cells were built in the upper eastern wing. Due to their position, directly under the lead roof, they were known as Piombi. Among the famous inmates of the prison were Silvio Pellico and Giacomo Casanova. The latter in his biography describes escaping through the roof, re-entering the palace, and exiting through the Porta della Carta.

===Bridge of Sighs and the New Prisons===
A corridor leads over the Bridge of Sighs, built in 1614 to link the Doge&#x27;s Palace to the structure intended to house the New Prisons. Enclosed and covered on all sides, the bridge contains two separate corridors that run next to each other. That which visitors use today linked the Prisons to the chambers of the Magistrato alle Leggi and the Quarantia Criminal; the other linked the prisons to the State Advocacy rooms and the Parlatorio. Both corridors are linked to the service staircase that leads from the ground floor cells of the Pozzi to the roof cells of the Piombi.

The famous name of the bridge dates from the Romantic period and was supposed to refer to the sighs of prisoners who, passing from the courtroom to the cell in which they would serve their sentence, took a last look at freedom as they glimpsed the lagoon and San Giorgio through the small windows. In the mid-16th century, it was decided to build a new structure on the other side of the canal to the side of the palace which would house prisons and the chambers of the magistrates known as the Notte al Criminal. Ultimately linked to the palace by the Bridge of Sighs, the building was intended to improve the conditions for prisoners with larger and more light-filled and airy cells. However, certain sections of the new prisons fall short of this aim, particularly those laid out with passageways on all sides and those cells which give onto the inner courtyard of the building. In keeping with previous traditions, each cell was lined with overlapping planks of larch that were nailed in place.

The only art theft from the Doge&#x27;s Palace was executed on 9 October 1991 by Vincenzo Pipino, who hid in one of the cells in the New Prisons after lagging behind a tour group, then crossed the Bridge of Sighs in the middle of the night to the Sala di Censori. In that room was the &quot;Madonna col bambino&quot;, a work symbolic of &quot;the power of the Venetian state&quot; painted in the early 1500s by a member of the Vivarini school. By the next morning, it was in the possession of the Mala del Brenta organized crime group. The painting was recovered by the police on 7 November 1991.

==Influences==

===Azerbaijan===
The Ismailiyya building in Baku, which at present serves as the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan, was styled after the Doge&#x27;s Palace.

===Romania===
The Central rail station, in Iași, built in 1870, had as a model the architecture of the Doge&#x27;s Palace. On the central part, there is a &quot;loggia&quot; with five arcades and pillars made of curved stone, having at the top three ogives.

===United Kingdom===
There are a number of 19th-century imitations of the palace&#x27;s architecture in the United Kingdom, for example:
* the Wool Exchange, Bradford,
* the Wedgwood Institute, Burslem,
* the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh
* the Templeton&#x27;s Carpet Factory, Glasgow.
These revivals of Venetian Gothic were influenced by the theories of John Ruskin, author of the three-volume &quot;The Stones of Venice&quot;, which appeared in the 1850s.

===United States===

====19th-century imitations====
The Montauk Club in Park Slope, Brooklyn (1889) imitates elements of the palace&#x27;s architecture, although the architect is usually said to have been inspired by another Venetian Gothic palace, the Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro.

The elaborate arched facade of the Bush Street Temple in San Francisco, built in 1895, is a copy in painted redwood of the Doge&#x27;s Palace.

The exterior of the Chicago Athletic Association building (1893) is based on the Doge&#x27;s Palace.

====20th-century imitations====
The ornate gothic style of the Doge&#x27;s Palace (and other similar palaces throughout Italy) is replicated in the Hall of Doges at the Davenport Hotel in Spokane, Washington by architect Kirtland Cutter.

The facade of the building is replicated at the Italy Pavilion in Epcot at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida.

Along with other Venetian landmarks, the palace is imitated in The Venetian, Las Vegas and its sister resort The Venetian Macao.

====21st-century imitations====
The Doge&#x27;s Palace was recreated and is playable in the 2009 video game, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed II&quot;. In the game, one of the objectives is to get protagonist Ezio Auditore da Firenze to fly a hang-glider built for him by Leonardo da Vinci into the Palazzo Ducale in order to prevent a Templar plot to kill the current Doge, Giovanni Mocenigo. Though he arrives too late to prevent the Doge from being poisoned, he does manage to kill the assassin, Carlo Grimaldi, who was a member of the Council of Ten.

<text>Vitamin deficiency is the condition of a long-term lack of a vitamin. When caused by not enough vitamin intake it is classified as a &quot;primary deficiency&quot;, whereas when due to an underlying disorder such as malabsorption it is called a &quot;secondary deficiency&quot;. An underlying disorder can have 2 main causes:
* Metabolic causes: Genetic defects in enzymes (e.g. kynureninase) involved in the kynurenine pathway of synthesis of niacin from tryptophan can lead to pellagra (niacin deficiency).
* Lifestyle choices: Lifestyle choices and habits that increase vitamin needs, such as smoking or drinking alcohol. Government guidelines on vitamin deficiencies advise certain intakes for healthy people, with specific values for women, men, babies, children, the elderly, and during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Many countries have mandated vitamin food fortification programs to prevent commonly occurring vitamin deficiencies.

Conversely, hypervitaminosis refers to symptoms caused by vitamin intakes in excess of needs, especially for fat-soluble vitamins that can accumulate in body tissues.

The history of the discovery of vitamin deficiencies progressed over centuries from observations that certain conditions – for example, scurvy – could be prevented or treated with certain foods having high content of a necessary vitamin, to the identification and description of specific molecules essential for life and health. During the 20th century, several scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine or the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their roles in the discovery of vitamins.

==Defining deficiency==
A number of regions have published guidelines defining vitamin deficiencies and advising specific intakes for healthy people, with different recommendations for women, men, infants, the elderly, and during pregnancy and breast feeding including Japan, the European Union, the United States, and Canada. These documents have been updated as research is published. In the US, Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) were first set in 1941 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences. There were periodic updates, culminating in the Dietary Reference Intakes. Updated in 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration published a set of tables that define Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and (RDAs). RDAs are higher to cover people with higher than average needs. Together, these are part of Dietary Reference Intakes. For a few vitamins, there is not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs. For these, an Adequate Intake is shown, based on an assumption that what healthy people consume is sufficient. Countries do not always agree on the amounts of vitamins needed to safeguard against deficiency. For example, for vitamin C, the RDAs for women for Japan, the European Union (called Population Reference Intakes) and the US are 100, 95 and 75 mg/day, respectively. India sets its recommendation at 40 mg/day.

==Individual vitamin deficiencies==
===Water-soluble vitamins===


===Fat-soluble vitamins===
==Prevention==
===Food fortification===
Food fortification is the process of adding micronutrients (essential trace elements and vitamins) to food as a public health policy which aims to reduce the number of people with dietary deficiencies within a population. Staple foods of a region can lack particular nutrients due to the soil of the region or from inherent inadequacy of a normal diet. Addition of micronutrients to staples and condiments can prevent large-scale deficiency diseases in these cases.

As defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), fortification refers to &quot;the practice of deliberately increasing the content of an essential micronutrient, i.e., vitamins and minerals in a food irrespective of whether the nutrients were originally in the food before processing or not, so as to improve the nutritional quality of the food supply and to provide a public health benefit with minimal risk to health&quot;, whereas enrichment is defined as &quot;synonymous with fortification and refers to the addition of micronutrients to a food which are lost during processing&quot;. The Food Fortification Initiative lists all countries in the world that conduct fortification programs, and within each country, what nutrients are added to which foods. Vitamin fortification programs exist in one or more countries for folate, niacin, riboflavin, thiamin, vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin D and vitamin E. As of 21 December 2018, 81 countries required food fortification with one or more vitamins. The most commonly fortified vitamin – as used in 62 countries – is folate; the most commonly fortified food is wheat flour.

===Genetic engineering===
Starting in 2000, rice was experimentally genetically engineered to produce higher than normal beta-carotene content, giving it a yellow/orange color. The product is referred to as golden rice (&quot;Oryza sativa&quot;). Biofortified sweet potato, maize, and cassava were other crops introduced to enhance the content of beta-carotene and certain minerals.

When eaten, beta-carotene is a provitamin, converted to retinol (vitamin A). The concept is that in areas of the world where vitamin A deficiency is common, growing and eating this rice would reduce the rates of vitamin A deficiency, particularly its effect on childhood vision problems. As of 2018, fortified golden crops were still in the process of government approvals, and were being assessed for taste and education about their health benefits to improve acceptance and adoption by consumers in impoverished countries.

==Hypervitaminosis==
Some vitamins cause acute or chronic toxicity, a condition called hypervitaminosis, which occurs mainly for fat-soluble vitamins if over-consumed by excessive supplementation. Hypervitaminosis A and hypervitaminosis D are the most common examples. Vitamin D toxicity does not result from sun exposure or consuming foods rich in vitamin D, but rather from excessive intake of vitamin D supplements, possibly leading to hypercalcemia, nausea, weakness, and kidney stones.

The United States, European Union and Japan, among other countries, have established &quot;tolerable upper intake levels&quot; for those vitamins which have documented toxicity.

==History==
In 1747, the Scottish surgeon James Lind discovered that citrus foods helped prevent scurvy, a particularly deadly disease in which collagen is not properly formed, causing poor wound healing, bleeding of the gums, severe pain, and death. In 1753, Lind published his &quot;Treatise on the Scurvy&quot;, which recommended using lemons and limes to avoid scurvy, which was adopted by the British Royal Navy. This led to the nickname &quot;limey&quot; for British sailors. Lind&#x27;s discovery, however, was not widely accepted by individuals in the Royal Navy&#x27;s Arctic expeditions in the 19th century, where it was widely believed that scurvy could be prevented by practicing good hygiene, regular exercise, and maintaining the morale of the crew while on board, rather than by a diet of fresh food.

During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the use of deprivation studies allowed scientists to isolate and identify a number of vitamins. Lipid from fish oil was used to cure rickets in rats, and the fat-soluble nutrient was called &quot;antirachitic A&quot;. Thus, the first &quot;vitamin&quot; bioactivity ever isolated, which cured rickets, was initially called &quot;vitamin A&quot;; however, the bioactivity of this compound is now called vitamin D. In 1881, Russian medical doctor Nikolai I. Lunin studied the effects of scurvy at the University of Tartu. He fed mice an artificial mixture of all the separate constituents of milk known at that time, namely the proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and salts. The mice that received only the individual constituents died, while the mice fed by milk itself developed normally. He made a conclusion that substances essential for life must be present in milk other than the known principal ingredients. However, his conclusions were rejected by his advisor, Gustav von Bunge.

In East Asia, where polished white rice was the common staple food of the middle class, beriberi resulting from lack of vitamin B1 was endemic. In 1884, Takaki Kanehiro, a British-trained medical doctor of the Imperial Japanese Navy, observed that beriberi was endemic among low-ranking crew who often ate nothing but rice, but not among officers who consumed a Western-style diet. With the support of the Japanese Navy, he experimented using crews of two battleships; one crew was fed only white rice, while the other was fed a diet of meat, fish, barley, rice, and beans. The group that ate only white rice documented 161 crew members with beriberi and 25 deaths, while the latter group had only 14 cases of beriberi and no deaths. This convinced Takaki and the Japanese Navy that diet was the cause of beriberi, but they mistakenly believed that sufficient amounts of protein prevented it. That diseases could result from some dietary deficiencies was further investigated by Christiaan Eijkman, who in 1897 discovered that feeding unpolished rice instead of the polished variety to chickens helped to prevent beriberi. The following year, Frederick Hopkins postulated that some foods contained &quot;accessory factors&quot; — in addition to proteins, carbohydrates, fats &quot;etc.&quot; — that are necessary for the functions of the human body. Hopkins and Eijkman were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1929 for their discoveries.
In 1910, the first vitamin complex was isolated by Japanese scientist Umetaro Suzuki, who succeeded in extracting a water-soluble complex of micronutrients from rice bran and named it aberic acid (later &quot;Orizanin&quot;). He published this discovery in a Japanese scientific journal. When the article was translated into German, the translation failed to state that it was a newly discovered nutrient, a claim made in the original Japanese article, and hence his discovery failed to gain publicity. In 1912 Polish-born biochemist Casimir Funk, working in London, isolated the same complex of micronutrients and proposed the complex be named &quot;vitamine&quot;. It was later to be known as vitamin B3 (niacin), though he described it as &quot;anti-beri-beri-factor&quot; (which would today be called thiamine or vitamin B1). Funk proposed the hypothesis that other diseases, such as rickets, pellagra, coeliac disease, and scurvy could also be cured by vitamins. Max Nierenstein, a friend and reader of Biochemistry at Bristol University, reportedly suggested the &quot;vitamine&quot; name (from &quot;vital amine&quot;). The name soon became synonymous with Hopkins&#x27; &quot;accessory factors&quot;, and by the time it was shown that not all vitamins are amines the word was already ubiquitous. In 1920, Jack Cecil Drummond proposed that the final &quot;e&quot; be dropped to deemphasize the &quot;amine&quot; reference, after researchers began to suspect that not all &quot;vitamines&quot; (in particular, vitamin A) have an amine component.

In 1930, Paul Karrer elucidated the correct structure for beta-carotene, the main precursor of vitamin A, and identified other carotenoids. Karrer and Norman Haworth confirmed Albert Szent-Györgyi&#x27;s discovery of ascorbic acid and made significant contributions to the chemistry of flavins, which led to the identification of lactoflavin. For their investigations on carotenoids, flavins and vitamins A and B2, Karrer and Haworth jointly received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937. In 1931, Albert Szent-Györgyi and a fellow researcher Joseph Svirbely suspected that &quot;hexuronic acid&quot; was actually vitamin C, and gave a sample to Charles Glen King, who proved its anti-scorbutic activity in his long-established guinea pig scorbutic assay. In 1937, Szent-Györgyi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this discovery. In 1938, Richard Kuhn was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on carotenoids and vitamins, specifically B2 and B6. In 1943, Edward Adelbert Doisy and Henrik Dam were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of vitamin K and its chemical structure. In 1967, George Wald was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (jointly with Ragnar Granit and Haldan Keffer Hartline) for the discovery that vitamin A could participate directly in a physiological process.

<text>Paul Joseph Morrissey (February 23, 1938 – October 28, 2024) was an American film director, known for his early association with Andy Warhol. His most famous films include &quot;Flesh&quot; (1968), &quot;Trash&quot; (1970), &quot;Heat&quot; (1972), &quot;Flesh for Frankenstein&quot; (1973), and &quot;Blood for Dracula&quot; (1974), all starring Joe Dallesandro, 1971&#x27;s &quot;Women in Revolt&quot; and the 1980s New York trilogy &quot;Forty Deuce&quot; (1982), &quot;Mixed Blood&quot; (1985), and &quot;Spike of Bensonhurst&quot; (1988).

From 1965 to 1973, Morrissey ran the publicity and filmmaking activity for Warhol at The Factory (first at 231 E. 47th St. and then at 33 Union Square West in New York City). Additionally, between 1966 and 1967, he managed the Velvet Underground and Nico and co-conceived and named Warhol&#x27;s traveling multi-media Happening the Exploding Plastic Inevitable. In 1969, alongside Warhol and publisher John Wilcock, Morrissey launched the print magazine &quot;Interview&quot; hiring its longtime editor Bob Colacello in autumn 1970.

In 1971, Warhol and Morrissey purchased Eothen in Montauk, New York, a 12-hectare oceanfront estate on the Long Island shore for $225,000. Morrissey would sell the estate in 2006 to J. Crew CEO Millard Drexler.

In 1998, Morrissey was given the Jack Smith Lifetime Achievement Award at the Chicago Underground Film Festival.

== Early life and career ==
Born in Manhattan, New York, on February 23, 1938, to Irish Catholic parents Joseph and Eleanor Morrissey, Paul Joseph Morrissey grew up in Yonkers, New York. The fourth of five children, Morrissey attended Fordham Prep and Fordham University, both Catholic schools. Upon graduation, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, going through basic training at Fort Benning and Fort Dix, achieving the rank of First Lieutenant. While in the reserves following active duty, he moved to the East Village in late 1960 and opened the Exit Gallery, a small cinematheque at 36 E. 4th St., where he programmed a mix of underground films and documentaries, including &quot;Icarus&quot; (1960), Brian De Palma&#x27;s first film. Simultaneously, Morrissey began making his own short, silent 16mm comedies, including &quot;Mary Martin Does It&quot; (1962), &quot;Taylor Mead Dances&quot; (1963), and &quot;Like Sleep&quot; (1964). 
Introduced by poet and filmmaker Gerard Malanga, he first met Andy Warhol in June 1965 at the Astor Place Playhouse, where Morrissey was having a retrospective of his work. Taken by Morrissey&#x27;s resourcefulness and filmmaking expertise, Warhol invited him to the Factory to assist him with his next project, &quot;Space&quot;, filmed at the E. 47th St. Factory in July 1965 and featuring Edie Sedgwick, Danny Fields, Donald Lyons (a friend of Morrissey&#x27;s from his Fordham University days), and folk singer Eric Andersen. Several more Warhol-Morrissey collaborations followed, including &quot;My Hustler&quot; (1965), &quot;The Velvet Underground and Nico: A Symphony of Sound&quot; (1966), &quot;More Milk, Yvette&quot; (1966), &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot; (1966), &quot;Imitation of Christ&quot; (1967), &quot;Tub Girls&quot; (1967), &quot;Bike Boy&quot; (1967), &quot;I, a Man&quot; (1967), &quot;San Diego Surf&quot; (1968), and &quot;Lonesome Cowboys&quot; (1968).
While filming a scene in John Wilcock&#x27;s Manhattan apartment for Warhol&#x27;s 25-hour movie &quot;Four Stars&quot;, Morrissey first met Joe Dallesandro, who had friends who lived in the same building. Morrissey immediately cast him in a scene in &quot;Loves of Ondine&quot; (1967), Dallesandro&#x27;s first appearance in a Factory film.

After Valerie Solanas&#x27;s attempt on Warhol&#x27;s life in June 1968, Morrissey directed his first solo feature, &quot;Flesh&quot;. Produced for $4,000 by Warhol and starring Dallesandro, Maurice Braddell, Geri Miller, Geraldine Smith, Patti D&#x27;Arbanville, Louis Waldon, Jackie Curtis, and Candy Darling, the film was a box-office hit in West Germany, with over 3 million tickets sold.
The commercial and popular success of &quot;Flesh&quot; continued into the 1970s with two more films Morrissey directed, produced by Warhol and starring Dallesandro: &quot;Trash&quot;, featuring Jane Forth and Holly Woodlawn, the first transgender actress ever cast as the girlfriend of a lead character, and &quot;Heat&quot;, a satire about Hollywood based on &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; starring Dallesandro and Sylvia Miles.

In 1971, Morrissey executive produced and directed &quot;Women in Revolt&quot;, a send-up of the Women&#x27;s liberation movement starring trans Warhol superstars Jackie Curtis, Holly Woodlawn, and Candy Darling. A film still of Darling from &quot;Women in Revolt&quot; appears on the cover of The Smiths&#x27; single &quot;Sheila Take a Bow&quot;, the second time a Morrissey film appeared on the cover of a Smiths record.

Reflecting on this period in an interview with Lucy Hughes-Hallett in March 1978, Morrissey said: &quot;To me, moviemaking is dealing with personalities, people who are always the way they are in every film, like John Wayne or Clint Eastwood, that kind of film-star personality, which is not very fashionable now. It doesn&#x27;t really matter what the camera&#x27;s doing as long as the people are worth watching.&quot;

== Post-Factory years ==
In March 1973, Morrissey went to Rome and directed two back-to-back features, &quot;Flesh for Frankenstein&quot; (1973) and &quot;Blood for Dracula&quot; (1974), starring Dallesandro and Udo Kier. Produced by Carlo Ponti and presented by Warhol, their international success propelled Morrissey out of the Factory and into his first and only attempt at directing a studio film, &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, co-written by Morrissey, Peter Cook, and Dudley Moore. It was a commercial and critical flop. Morrissey moved to Los Angeles in the late 1970s and returned to independently produced features, starting with &quot;Madame Wang&#x27;s&quot; (1981), a satire of the LA punk-rock scene, starring Patrick Schoene and Morrissey&#x27;s niece Christina Indri.


Returning to New York City in the early 1980s, Morrissey began a collaboration with playwright and screenwriter Alan Bowne, directing a film version of his 1981 play &quot;Forty Deuce&quot; (1982) starring Orson Bean and Kevin Bacon. Morrissey worked again with Bowne on the screenplays for &quot;Mixed Blood&quot; (1985) and &quot;Spike of Bensonhurst&quot; (1988), completing a trilogy of films taking a satirical, empathetic look at the political, social and moral decay of New York City and its outer boroughs during the Ed Koch years.

In later years, Morrissey was publicly critical of Warhol, saying that work attributed to Warhol was created by associates without his involvement, and expressing frustration when his films were associated with Warhol&#x27;s name.

Morrissey&#x27;s last feature, &quot;News From Nowhere&quot; (2010), made its U.S. debut at Film at Lincoln Center in 2011.

Speaking to screenwriter and biographer Gavin Lambert, filmmaker George Cukor said of Morrissey&#x27;s work: 
He makes a marvelous kind of world, and a marvelous kind of mischief, holding nothing back and just watching it happen. &quot;Personal expression&quot; is a much abused expression, but these films are real expression ... Nobody has done anything like it. The selection of people, the casting, is absolutely brilliant and impertinent. The life they see, the gutter they see, or the world they see is so funny and agonizing, and they see it so vividly, with such original humor.

==Personal life and death==
&quot;Bright Lights Film Journal&quot; once called Morrissey a &quot;contradiction&quot;: a Warhol collaborator who was a &quot;straight right-wing Catholic Republican&quot;. When film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum asked Morrissey in a 1975 interview why he portrayed drug addicts and street hustlers with such sympathy despite his conservatism, Morrissey responded: &quot;A human being is a sympathetic entity. No matter how terrible a person might be, someone with an artist&#x27;s point of view will try to render his individuality without condescension or contempt. That&#x27;s the natural function of a dramatist. The movies I&#x27;ve made have no connection to my personal beliefs&quot;.

Morrissey died from pneumonia at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, on October 28, 2024, at the age of 86.

<doc id="103566" wikidata="Q1382002" url="?curid=103566" title="Everett Dirksen">
<text>Everett McKinley Dirksen (January 4, 1896 – September 7, 1969) was an American politician. A Republican, he represented Illinois in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate. As Senate Minority Leader from 1959 until his death in 1969, he played a highly visible and key role in the politics of the 1960s. He helped write and pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968, both landmark pieces of legislation during the civil rights movement. He was also one of the Senate&#x27;s strongest supporters of the Vietnam War. A talented orator with a florid style and a notably rich bass voice, he delivered flamboyant speeches that caused his detractors to refer to him as &quot;The Wizard of Ooze&quot;.

Born in Pekin, Illinois, Dirksen served as an artillery officer during World War I and opened a bakery after the war. After serving on the Pekin City Council, he won election to the House of Representatives in 1932. In the House, he was considered a moderate and supported much of the New Deal; he became more conservative and isolationist over time, but reversed himself to support US involvement in World War II. He won election to the Senate in 1950, unseating Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas. In the Senate, he favored conservative economic policies and supported the internationalism of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Dirksen succeeded William F. Knowland as Senate Minority Leader after the latter declined to seek re-election in 1958.

As the Senate Minority Leader, Dirksen emerged as a prominent national figure of the Republican Party during the 1960s. He developed a good working relationship with Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and supported President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s handling of the Vietnam War. He helped break the Southern filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. While still serving as Senate Minority Leader, Dirksen died in 1969.

The Dirksen Senate Office Building at the Capitol Building in Washington, and the Dirksen United States Courthouse in central Chicago are named for him.

==Early life==
Everett McKinley Dirksen was born on January 4, 1896, in Pekin, Illinois, a small city near Peoria. His parents were German immigrants from East Frisia near the Dutch border. His father Johann Friedrich Dirksen was born in Jennelt and his mother Antje (née Conrady) was born in Loquard. Today, both villages are part of the municipality of Krummhörn.

The Dirksens were strong Republicans. Everett&#x27;s parents gave him the middle name &quot;McKinley&quot; after William McKinley, then a leading candidate for the Republican nomination for president. His fraternal twin, Thomas Reed Dirksen, was named for Speaker of the House Thomas Brackett Reed, also a candidate for the nomination at the time. Another brother, Benjamin, was named for President Benjamin Harrison. Everett had two older half-brothers, Thomas and Henry, from his mother&#x27;s first marriage to Beren Ailts (died 1890).

Johann and Antje Dirksen spoke a Low German dialect at home and taught German to their children. Johann Dirksen farmed and worked at the Pekin Wagon Works as a design painter. He had a debilitating stroke when Everett was five years old and he died when Everett was nine.

Dirksen grew up on a farm managed by his mother in a neighborhood called Bonchefiddle (″Böhnchenviertel″, Low German for &quot;beans quarter&quot;) on the outskirts of Pekin. The neighborhood was known as Bonchefiddle because frugal immigrants grew beans in their front yards instead of decorative flowers. He attended local schools and graduated from Pekin High School in 1913 as the class salutatorian. While in school, he helped support the family by working at a Pekin corn refining factory.

Dirksen attended the University of Minnesota, where he was a pre-law student from 1914 to 1917. He paid his tuition by working in the classified advertising department at the &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot;, as a door-to-door magazine and book salesman, as an attorney&#x27;s assistant, and as a clerk in a railroad freight office. While attending the university, Dirksen participated in the Student Army Training Corps and attained the rank of major in the school&#x27;s corps of cadets. He also gained his first political experience by giving local and on-campus speeches in support of Republican presidential nominee Charles Evans Hughes during the 1916 campaign.

==Military service==
At the start of World War I, the Dirksens came under local scrutiny for their German heritage. Dirksen&#x27;s mother refused to take down a living room photo of Kaiser Wilhelm II as demanded by a self-appointed Pekin &quot;loyalty commission&quot; on the grounds that &quot;it&#x27;s a free country.&quot; Benjamin Dirksen was medically unfit for military service and Thomas was married. It fell to Everett to demonstrate the family&#x27;s patriotism by serving in uniform. He dropped out of college to enlist in the United States Army.

On January 4, 1917, his twenty-first birthday, Dirksen joined the United States Army. Three months later, the United States entered World War I. He completed his initial training in field artillery at Camp Custer, Michigan, performed duty with his unit at Camp Jackson, South Carolina, and attained the rank of sergeant. He was deployed to France in 1918 and attended artillery school and officer training at Saumur. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant and assigned to the 328th Field Artillery Regiment, a unit of the 85th Division. Dirksen was trained as an aerial observer and conducted target acquisition and assessment of field artillery bombardments in the Saint-Mihiel sector as a member of the 328th Field Artillery&#x27;s 13th and 19th Balloon Companies. He later performed the same duty for the 69th Balloon Company, a unit of the IV Corps. He subsequently served in the intelligence staff section (G-2) of the IV Corps headquarters. Dirksen performed post-war occupation duty with IV Corps in Germany until mid-1919. Dirksen declined an opportunity to remain with the Army of Occupation (extended due to his fluent German), received his discharge, and returned to Pekin.

==Post-war==
After the war, Dirksen invested money in an electric washing machine business, but it failed, after which he joined his brothers in running the Dirksen Brothers Bakery. He also wrote a number of unpublished short stories, as well as plays with former classmate Hubert Ropp. Dirksen was active in the American Legion, and his appearances on its behalf gave him the opportunity to hone his public speaking skills.

His political career began in 1926 when he was elected to the nonpartisan Pekin City Council. He placed first in a field of eight candidates vying for four seats. At the time, the top vote-getter also received appointment as the city&#x27;s commissioner of accounts and finance. Dirksen held both posts from 1927 to 1931.

==U.S. representative==
===Elections===
In 1930, Dirksen unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Representative William E. Hull in the Republican primary. He lost by 1,155 votes, 51.06% to 48.94%. In 1932, he challenged Hull again, and won with 52.5% of the vote.

He was re-elected seven times from 1934 to 1946. His closest challenge came in 1936, when Charles C. Dickman held him to 53.25% of the vote amid a national and statewide landslide for the Democratic Party.

===Tenure===
His support for many New Deal programs initially marked him as a moderate, pragmatic Republican, though over time he became increasingly conservative and isolationist. During World War II, he lobbied successfully for an expansion of congressional staff resources to eliminate the practice under which House and Senate committees borrowed executive branch personnel to accomplish legislative work. He reversed his isolationist stance to support the war effort, but also secured the passage of an amendment to the Lend Lease Act by introducing it while 65 of the House&#x27;s Democrats were at a luncheon. It provided that the Senate and the House could, by a simple majority in a concurrent resolution, revoke the war powers granted to the president.

Dirksen studied law privately in Washington, D.C. after he was elected to Congress. He was admitted to the District of Columbia Bar in 1936 and the bar of Illinois in 1937.

In December 1943, Dirksen announced that he would be a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 1944. He stated that a coalition of midwestern Republican representatives had urged him to run and that his campaign was serious. However, press pundits had assumed that the candidacy was a vehicle to siphon support away from the campaign of Wendell Willkie, whose reputation as a maverick and staunch internationalist had earned him the hatred of many Republican Party regulars, especially in the Midwest. Dirksen&#x27;s presidential campaign was apparently still alive on the eve of the 1944 convention, as &quot;Time&quot; speculated that he was running for vice president. Dirksen received no votes for either office from delegates at the convention.

In 1947, Dirksen was diagnosed with chorioretinitis in his right eye. Despite a number of physicians recommending that the eye be removed, Dirksen chose treatment and rest; he recovered most of the sight in the afflicted eye. In 1948, he declined to run for re-election because of his ailment.

==U.S. senator==

Dirksen was a Republican Senator 1951–1969.
===Elections===
In 1950, Dirksen unseated Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas. In the campaign, the support of Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy helped Dirksen gain a narrow victory.

In 1956, Dirksen was re-elected over Democrat Richard Stengel, 54.1% to 45.7%.

In 1962, Dirksen was re-elected to a third term over Democrat Sidney R. Yates, 52.9% to 47.1%.

In 1968, Dirksen was re-elected to his fourth and final term over Democrat William G. Clark, 53.0% to 46.6%.

===Tenure===
In 1952, Dirksen supported the presidential candidacy of fellow Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, the longtime leader of the Republican party&#x27;s conservative wing. At the national party convention, Dirksen gave a speech attacking New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey, a liberal Republican and the leading supporter of General Dwight Eisenhower. During his speech, Dirksen pointed at Dewey on the convention floor and shouted, &quot;Don&#x27;t take us down the path to defeat again&quot;, a reference to Dewey&#x27;s presidential defeats in 1944 and 1948. His speech was met by cheers from conservative delegates and loud boos from pro-Eisenhower delegates. After Eisenhower won the nomination, Dirksen supported him.

In 1959, he was elected Senate Minority Leader, defeating John Sherman Cooper, a more liberal senator from Kentucky, 20–14. Dirksen successfully united the various factions of the Republican Party by granting younger Republicans more representation in the Senate leadership and better committee appointments. He held the position of Senate Minority Leader until his death.

Along with House Minority Leaders Charles Halleck and Gerald Ford, Dirksen was the official voice of the Republican Party during most of the 1960s. He discussed politics on television news programs. On several occasions, political cartoonist Herblock depicted Dirksen and Halleck as vaudeville song-and-dance men, wearing identical elaborate costumes and performing an act called &quot;The Ev and Charlie Show&quot;.

The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; once reported that Dirksen had changed his mind 62 times on foreign policy matters, 31 times on military affairs, and 70 times on agricultural policies.

===Vietnam War===
As senator, Dirksen reversed his early isolationism to support the internationalism of Republican President Eisenhower and Democratic President John F. Kennedy. He was a leading &quot;hawk&quot; on the issue of the Vietnam War, a position he held well before President Johnson decided to escalate the war.

Dirksen said in February 1964:
First I agree that obviously we cannot retreat from our position in Vietnam. I have been out there three times, once as something of an emissary for then President Eisenhower. I took a good look at it. It is a difficult situation, to say the least. But we are in to the tune of some $350 million. I think the last figure I have seen indicates that we have over 15,500 military out there, ostensibly as advisers and that sort of thing. We are not supposed to have combatant troops, even though we were not signatories to the treaty that was signed at Geneva when finally they got that whole business out of the fire. But we are going to have to muddle through for a while and see what we do. Even though it costs us $1.5 million a day.
As Johnson followed the recommendations and escalated the war, Dirksen gave him strong support in public and inside the Republican caucus. Some Republicans advised him that it would be to the party&#x27;s advantage to oppose Johnson. Ford commented, &quot;I strongly felt that although I agreed with the goals of the Johnson administration in Vietnam, I vigorously criticized their prosecution of the war. Now, Dirksen never took that same hard-line position that I took.&quot;

===Civil rights legislation===
Dirksen voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In 1964, amid a 54-day filibuster by Southern senators of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Dirksen, Republican Thomas Kuchel and Democrats Hubert Humphrey and Mike Mansfield introduced a compromise amendment. It weakened the House version on the government&#x27;s power to regulate the conduct of private business, but it was not so weak it would cause the House to reconsider the legislation. The Department of Justice said the Mansfield-Dirksen Amendment would not prevent effective enforcement. However, Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia refused to allow a vote on the amendment. Finally, Republican Senator Thruston Morton proposed an amendment that guaranteed jury trials in all criminal contempt cases except voting rights. It was approved on June 9, and Humphrey made a deal with three Republicans to substitute it for the Mansfield-Dirksen Amendment in exchange for their supporting cloture on the filibuster. Thus, after 57 days of filibuster, the substitute bill passed in the Senate, and the House–Senate conference committee agreed to adopt the Senate version of the bill.

At that cloture vote, Dirksen said: &quot;Victor Hugo wrote in his diary substantially this sentiment: &#x27;Stronger than all the armies is an idea whose time has come.&#x27; The time has come for equality of opportunity in sharing of government, in education, and in employment. It must not be stayed or denied.&quot;

On March 22, 1966, Dirksen introduced a constitutional amendment to permit public school administrators providing for organized prayer by students; the introduction was in response to &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot;, which struck down the practice. Considered by opponents to violate the principle of separation of church and state, the amendment was defeated in the Senate and gained only 49 affirmative votes, far short of the 67 votes a constitutional amendment needs for passage.

Dirksen was a firm opponent of the doctrine of one man, one vote on the grounds that large cities (such as Chicago in Dirksen&#x27;s home state of Illinois) could render rural residents of a state powerless in their state governments without some form of concurrent majority. After the Warren Court imposed one-man-one-vote on all state legislative houses in the 1964 case &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot;, he led an ultimately unsuccessful effort to convene an Article V convention for an amendment to the Constitution that would allow for legislative districts of unequal population.

===Oratory===
The saying, &quot;&quot; has been attributed to Dirksen, but there is no direct record of Dirksen saying the remark. Dirksen is also quoted as having said, &quot;The mind is no match with the heart in persuasion; constitutionality is no match with compassion.&quot;

Dirksen recorded four spoken-word albums. In 1967 a recording of his own poem &quot;Gallant Men&quot; reached No. 16 on the Billboard 200 and won a Grammy Award for Best Documentary Recording in 1968. On January 7, 1967, Dirksen became the oldest person to reach the Hot 100&#x27;s top 40, at 71 years, 3 days old, when the single reached No. 33; two weeks later it reached No. 29. In Canada the recording reached No. 76, February 4, 1967. The distinction passed from Dirksen to Moms Mabley with her recording of &quot;Abraham, Martin and John&quot; peaking at No. 35 on July 19, 1969, when she was 75 years 4 months old; then, more than 54 years after that, to Brenda Lee with her recording of &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; from 1958 topping the Hot 100 on 9 (and 16) December 2023 when she was 78 years 363 days old.

Recordings of Dirksen&#x27;s speeches were edited into a mock interview included on the record &quot;&quot;Welcome to the LBJ Ranch!&quot;&quot; Dirksen was pleased with his inclusion on the parody record and bought many copies to give out as Christmas gifts.

Dirksen made television guest appearances on game and variety shows, such as &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot; and &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;. Dirksen made a cameo appearance in the 1969 film &quot;The Monitors&quot;, a low-budget science-fiction movie in which invading extraterrestrials assert political dominion over the human race. He also appeared in several other movies.

==Personal life==
Dirksen&#x27;s widow, Louella, died of cancer on July 16, 1979. Their daughter Joy, the first wife of Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee, died of cancer on April 24, 1993.

Dirksen was a member of the Second Reformed Church, which, although a Dutch Reformed Church, was primarily German (the Reformed Church in America was founded in the 18th century by Dutch immigrants).

Dirksen was a Freemason and was a member of Pekin Lodge No. 29. In 1954, he was grand orator of the Grand Lodge of Illinois. He was honored with the 33rd degree in 1954.

==Death==

Dirksen was a heavy smoker. In August 1969, chest X-rays disclosed an asymptomatic peripherally located mass in the upper lobe of the right lung. Dirksen entered Walter Reed Army Hospital for surgery, which was undertaken on September 2. A right upper lobectomy removed what proved to be lung cancer (adenocarcinoma). Dirksen initially did well, but progressive complications developed into bronchopneumonia. He suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest and died on September 7, 1969, at age 73.

Dirksen lay in state at the United States Capitol rotunda, followed by burial at Glendale Memorial Gardens in Pekin.

==Legacy and honors==
Dirksen was known for his fondness for the common marigold. When political discussions became tense, he would lighten the atmosphere by taking up his perennial campaign to have the marigold named the national flower, but it never succeeded. In 1972, his hometown of Pekin started holding an annual Marigold Festival in his memory. It now identifies itself as the &quot;Marigold Capital of the World&quot;.

Dirksen was the recipient of honorary degrees (LL.D.) from Hope College, Bradley University, DePaul University, Lincoln Memorial University, Hanover College, Lewis University, and Illinois College.

<doc id="103586" wikidata="Q2420767" url="?curid=103586" title="Chosen-ciphertext attack">
<text>A chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the cryptanalyst can gather information by obtaining the decryptions of chosen ciphertexts. From these pieces of information the adversary can attempt to recover the secret key used for decryption.

For formal definitions of security against chosen-ciphertext attacks, see for example: Michael Luby and Mihir Bellare et al.

==Introduction==
A number of otherwise secure schemes can be defeated under chosen-ciphertext attack. For example, the El Gamal cryptosystem is semantically secure under chosen-plaintext attack, but this semantic security can be trivially defeated under a chosen-ciphertext attack. Early versions of RSA padding used in the SSL protocol were vulnerable to a sophisticated adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack which revealed SSL session keys. Chosen-ciphertext attacks have implications for some self-synchronizing stream ciphers as well. Designers of tamper-resistant cryptographic smart cards must be particularly cognizant of these attacks, as these devices may be completely under the control of an adversary, who can issue a large number of chosen-ciphertexts in an attempt to recover the hidden secret key.

It was not clear at all whether public key cryptosystems could withstand the chosen ciphertext attack until the initial breakthrough work of Moni Naor and Moti Yung in 1990, which suggested a mode of dual encryption with integrity proof (now known as the &quot;Naor-Yung&quot; encryption paradigm). This work made understanding of the notion of security against chosen ciphertext attack much clearer than before and open the research direction of constructing systems with various protections against variants of the attack.

When a cryptosystem is vulnerable to chosen-ciphertext attack, implementers must be careful to avoid situations in which an adversary might be able to decrypt chosen-ciphertexts (i.e., avoid providing a decryption oracle). This can be more difficult than it appears, as even partially chosen ciphertexts can permit subtle attacks. Additionally, other issues exist and some cryptosystems (such as RSA) use the same mechanism to sign messages and to decrypt them. This permits attacks when hashing is not used on the message to be signed. A better approach is to use a cryptosystem which is provably secure under chosen-ciphertext attack, including (among others) RSA-OAEP secure under the random oracle heuristics, Cramer-Shoup which was the first public key practical system to be secure. For symmetric encryption schemes it is known that authenticated encryption which is a primitive based on symmetric encryption gives security against chosen ciphertext attacks, as was first shown by Jonathan Katz and Moti Yung.

==Varieties==
Chosen-ciphertext attacks, like other attacks, may be adaptive or non-adaptive. In an adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack, the attacker can use the results from prior decryptions to inform their choices of which ciphertexts to have decrypted. In a non-adaptive attack, the attacker chooses the ciphertexts to have decrypted without seeing any of the resulting plaintexts. After seeing the plaintexts, the attacker can no longer obtain the decryption of additional ciphertexts.

===Lunchtime attacks===
A specially noted variant of the chosen-ciphertext attack is the &quot;lunchtime&quot;, &quot;midnight&quot;, or &quot;indifferent&quot; attack, in which an attacker may make adaptive chosen-ciphertext queries but only up until a certain point, after which the attacker must demonstrate some improved ability to attack the system. The term &quot;lunchtime attack&quot; refers to the idea that a user&#x27;s computer, with the ability to decrypt, is available to an attacker while the user is out to lunch. This form of the attack was the first one commonly discussed: obviously, if the attacker has the ability to make adaptive chosen ciphertext queries, no encrypted message would be safe, at least until that ability is taken away. This attack is sometimes called the &quot;non-adaptive chosen ciphertext attack&quot;; here, &quot;non-adaptive&quot; refers to the fact that the attacker cannot adapt their queries in response to the challenge, which is given after the ability to make chosen ciphertext queries has expired.

===Adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack===

A (full) adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack is an attack in which ciphertexts may be chosen adaptively before and after a challenge ciphertext is given to the attacker, with only the stipulation that the challenge ciphertext may not itself be queried. This is a stronger attack notion than the lunchtime attack, and is commonly referred to as a CCA2 attack, as compared to a CCA1 (lunchtime) attack. Few practical attacks are of this form. Rather, this model is important for its use in proofs of security against chosen-ciphertext attacks. A proof that attacks in this model are impossible implies that any realistic chosen-ciphertext attack cannot be performed.

A practical adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack is the Bleichenbacher attack against PKCS#1.

Numerous cryptosystems are proven secure against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks, some proving this security property based only on algebraic assumptions, some additionally requiring an idealized random oracle assumption. For example, the Cramer-Shoup system is secure based on number theoretic assumptions and no idealization, and after a number of subtle investigations it was also established that the practical scheme RSA-OAEP is secure under the RSA assumption in the idealized random oracle model.

<text>Denise Marie Quiñones August (born 9 September 1980) is a Puerto Rican actress, model and beauty queen who was crowned Miss Universe 2001. Prior to winning the Miss Universe pageant, she represented her hometown of Lares in the Miss Puerto Rico Universe 2001 pageant.

==Career==
Quiñones won the Miss Universe 2001 pageant in Bayamon, Puerto Rico in 2001. She was crowned by Lara Dutta, Miss Universe 2000 of India and also won the awards of Miss Photogenic, Bluepoint Swimsuit, and Clairol Best Style. She is only the fourth Miss Universe winner to also win Miss Photogenic after Margareta Arvidsson, Margarita Moran, and Janelle Commissiong. Her win came on the Miss Universe pageant&#x27;s 50th anniversary. As Miss Universe, Quiñones resided in New York City for a year, enjoying the benefits that all winners of the pageant receive, including complimentary make-up and haircare, a car, complete wardrobe, professional representation by the Miss Universe Organization, a $60,000 scholarship to a New York City film school, and traveling opportunities. Quiñones was the first winner to wear the reputed Mikimoto Crown during its official press presentation by Mikimoto&#x27;s former brand director, Mr. Toyohiko Miyamoto.

On the night of the Miss Universe 2002 contest, she passed on her crown, once again in Puerto Rico (this time the event was held in the city of San Juan), to Oxana Fedorova of Russia.

After relinquishing the title, Quiñones attended the School for Film and Television&#x27;s two-year conservatory acting program. Presently an actress, Quiñones has starred in the Spanish version of Nilo Cruz&#x27;s play &quot;Ana en el trópico&quot; (&quot;Anna in the Tropics&quot;) and continues to hone her talent in the United States. For her role in &quot;Anna in the Tropics&quot;, she was nominated and awarded an HOLA Award (from the Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors) and an ACE Award. In October 2005, she was selected for the role of Doña Rosita, in a production of Federico García Lorca&#x27;s play &quot;Doña Rosita la soltera&quot;.

Quiñones guest-starred in a season 5 episode of the WB Network television series &quot;Smallville&quot;. She played Andrea, a masked avenger who fought crime in Metropolis and invited Clark Kent (Tom Welling) to join her in her adventures. On the heels of her &quot;Smallville&quot; role, she was also cast in the role of &quot;Rachel&quot;, a young fighter pilot in the pilot for the TV series &quot;Aquaman&quot;, which was in development for the CW Television Network. The pilot did not make the fall 2006 lineup.

In November 2006, Quiñones led the off-Broadway cast of &quot;Zanahorias&quot; (or &quot;Carrots&quot; in English), a Spanish comedy by Spanish playwright Antonio Zancada. For her role in &quot;Zanahorias&quot;, she won an ACE Award in 2007.

In July 2008, it was announced that Quiñones would play the part of Lara in the upcoming film &quot;I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell&quot;, based on the book of the same name. On July 24, 2008, producer Tucker Max announced on the film&#x27;s official production blog that Quiñones had dropped out due to a scheduling conflict.

In February 2014, Quiñones joined the eighth season of Univision&#x27;s beauty pageant reality show Nuestra Belleza Latina 2014 as a team mentor where she coaches a team of young women on modeling industry success techniques.

On February 15, 2018, Quiñones was named as the new pageant director for Miss Universe Puerto Rico, taking over responsibilities previously held by former director Desiree Lowry.
 As national director, Quiñones assisted in preparing the island&#x27;s delegates for the Miss Universe pageant. Her most successful delegate was Madison Anderson who finished as 1st Runner-Up in 2019. Other successful delegates under her directorship were Kiara Ortega who finished in the Top 5 in 2018 and Estefanía Soto who finished in the Top 10 in 2020, respectively. In 2021, Quiñones stepped down as national director and Yizette Cifredo was designated as her successor.

==Personal life==
Quiñones was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico. She dated rapper René Pérez, from the band Calle 13, from 2006 to 2009. 
From 2010 to 2011, Quiñones was in a relationship with Dominican actor Frank Perozo.

<text>The Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust (WWT) is an international wildfowl and wetland conservation charity in the United Kingdom.

== History ==
The trust was founded in 1946 by the ornithologist and artist Sir Peter Scott as the Severn Wildfowl Trust.

The first site at Slimbridge was a centre for research and conservation. In a move unusual at the time, he opened the site to the public so that everyone could enjoy access to nature.

This organisation later developed into the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust, the only United Kingdom charity dedicated solely to promoting the protection of wetland birds and their habitats. Although starting out at Slimbridge, the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust now owns or manages nine other reserves in Britain, and advocates for wetlands and conservation issues world-wide. WWT Consulting was an offshoot of the Wildlife &amp; Wetland Trust and was based at Slimbridge. It provided ecological surveys and assessments, and offered consultancy services in wetland habitat design, wetland management, biological waste-water treatment systems and the management of reserves and their visitor centres. The Queen in later years became patron to the trust, and Prince Charles became the president.

The trust was instrumental in saving the nēnē (Hawaiian goose) from the brink of extinction in the 1950s.

==Nature reserves==
The trust has over 200,000 members and ten reserves with visitor centres. Together these cover over , and support over 150,000 birds. They receive over one million visitors per year. The reserves include seven SSSIs (site of Special Scientific Interest), five SPAs (Special Protection Areas) and five Ramsar sites.
*WWT Arundel, West Sussex
*WWT Caerlaverock, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland
*WWT Castle Espie, County Down, Northern Ireland
*WWT London Wetland Centre 
*WWT Llanelli Wetlands Centre, Carmarthenshire, Wales
*WWT Martin Mere, Lancashire
*WWT Slimbridge, Gloucestershire
*WWT Steart, Somerset
*WWT Washington, Tyne and Wear
*WWT Welney, Norfolk

==Conservation achievements==
In 1962 the first Nene geese, a species that at that time was threatened with extinction, were returned to Hawaii after a 25-year effort by the Trust, with the species later being downgraded from endangered to threatened on the IUCN Red List.

In 2009 the trust was instrumental in saving the Madagascan Pochard from the brink of extinction in Madagascar.  In 2006 a total 20 birds were discovered with the species previously thought to have been extinct. WWT and the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology hatched several clutches of eggs in captivity, and released the 21 birds onto Lake Sofia in 2018.

Together with partners and funders, RSPB, Pensthorpe Conservation Trust, and Viridor Credits, the trust reintroduced Common Cranes to the UK in 2010. The Great Crane Project successfully hand-reared and released 21 Eurasian cranes into the wild in England. The species had been absent in the UK for 400 years. As of 2022 there are over 200 cranes and hatchlings.

WWT&#x27;s aviculturists’ started hand-rearing critically endangered spoon-billed sandpiper chicks, and reared 16 in northern Russia in 2013, which boosted the global number of fledglings by 25%.

In 2014 the trust completed its Steart Marshes Project, creating 488 hectares of healthy wetlands which works to defend homes and businesses from flooding in a way that works with nature, not against it. 

Lead shot ammunition used for wildfowl shooting was banned in European wetlands in 2020 following WWT’s scientific research and a campaign by WWT and partners. The new law came into full effect on 15 February 2023.

==Consultancy==
At one time, the trust operated a consultancy business that provides external clients with a comprehensive range of wetland services. These included ecological survey and assessment, habitat design and management, visitor centre planning and design, and wetland treatment systems.

== Organisation ==
The Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust is a registered charity in England and Scotland. Sarah Fowler became the chief executive of the trust in March 2022. Her predecessor was Martin Spray, who was appointed in March 2004. In December 2012, Spray was appointed CBE.

<doc id="103615" wikidata="Q558116" url="?curid=103615" title="Firth">
<text>Firth is a word in the English and Scots languages used to denote various coastal waters in the United Kingdom, predominantly within Scotland. In the Northern Isles, it more often refers to a smaller inlet. It is linguistically cognate to Scandinavian &quot;fjord&quot; and &quot;fjard&quot; (all from Proto-Germanic *&quot;ferþuz&quot;), with the original meaning of &quot;sailable waterway&quot;. The word has a more constrained sense in English. Bodies of water named &quot;firths&quot; tend to be more common on the Scottish east coast, or in the southwest of the country, although the Firth of Clyde is an exception to this. The Highland coast contains numerous estuaries, straits, and inlets of a similar kind, but not called &quot;firth&quot; (e.g. the Minch and Loch Torridon); instead, these are often called sea lochs. Before about 1850, the spelling &quot;Frith&quot; was more common.

A firth is generally the result of ice age glaciation and is very often associated with a large river, where erosion caused by the tidal effects of incoming sea water passing upriver has widened the riverbed into an estuary. Demarcation can be rather vague. The Firth of Clyde is sometimes thought to include the estuary as far upriver as Dumbarton, but the Ordnance Survey map shows the change from river to firth occurring off Port Glasgow. In navigation terms, the dredged River Clyde Channel for shipping meets the Firth of Clyde Channel at the Tail of the Bank, where the river crosses a sandbar off Greenock as the estuary widens at the junction to the Gare Loch. Locally, the river can be described as extending even further west to Gourock point.

However, some firths are exceptions. The Cromarty Firth on the east coast of Scotland, for example, resembles a large loch with only a relatively small outlet to the sea and the Solway Firth and the Moray Firth are more like extremely large bays. The Pentland Firth is a strait rather than a bay or an inlet.

==Scottish firths==
===Firths on the west coast of Scotland (from north to south)===

*Firth of Lorn (connects with the Moray Firth via the Great Glen lochs and Caledonian Canal)
**Lochs adjoining the Firth: Loch Lochy, Loch Linnhe, Loch Leven, Loch Oich.
**Places: Oban, Fort William.

**Places: Helensburgh, Port Glasgow, Greenock, Gourock, Dunoon, Rothesay, Wemyss Bay, Largs, Brodick, Ardrossan, Troon, Ayr, Girvan and Campbeltown. Note that Glasgow is at the tidal limit of the River Clyde, and Clydebank, the Erskine Bridge and Dumbarton are on the river estuary as it widens out towards Port Glasgow.
** Islands: Bute, Cumbrae, Arran
**:In Scottish Gaelic, the Firth of Clyde is treated as two bodies, with the landward end being called (; meaning the same as the English), while the area around the south of Arran, Kintyre and Ayrshire/Galloway is .

**Headlands: Brims Ness, Brough Ness, Duncansby Head, Dunnet Head
**Islands: Hoy, Pentland Skerries, Swona, South Ronaldsay, South Walls (all generally considered to be part of Orkney); Stroma

===Firths in the Northern Isles===
The Northern Isles were part of Norway until the 15th century, and retain many Norse names. In Shetland in particular, &quot;firth&quot; can refer to smaller inlets, although geo, voe and wick are as common. In Orkney, &quot;wick&quot; is common.

* Orkney Islands
** Bay of Firth (Firth, Orkney)
** North Ronaldsay Firth
** Stronsay Firth
** Westray Firth
** Wide Firth
* Shetland Islands (Mainland)

** Collafirth/Colla Firth (two places of this name)
** Firths Voe, Firth
** Gon Firth
** Olna Firth
** Olnes Firth
** Quey Firth
** Unie Firth
** Ura Firth
** Burra Firth/Burrafirth (a number of Shetland places with this name)
** Effirth
* Shetland North Isles: Yell, Unst
** Whale Firth
** Burrafirth

===Other similar waters in Scotland===

In the Scottish Gaelic language, &quot;linne&quot; is used to refer to most of the firths above; it is also applied to the Sound of Sleat, Crowlin Sound, Cuillin Sound, Sound of Jura, Sound of Raasay, and part of Loch Linnhe.

The following is a selection of other bodies of water in Scotland which are similar to various firths, but which are not termed such –
*West coast
**Loch Broom (fjord), Loch Eriboll (fjord), Loch Hourn (fjord), Loch Tarbert, Jura (fjord), Loch Torridon (fjord); Loch Sween, a fjord, The Minch (Strait, &quot;Skotlandsfjörð&quot; (&quot;Scotland&#x27;s fjord/firth&quot;) in Old Norse.)
*East coast
**Eden Mouth (estuary, near St Andrews); Findhorn Bay, Montrose Basin (estuary/lagoon with narrow entrance); Tweed mouth (estuary, very near Scottish border)

Likewise, in the Northern Isles, the words &quot;firth&quot; and &quot;sound&quot; are often used arbitrarily or interchangeably. Bluemull Sound for example, is very similar to some of the firths in the Shetland Islands.

==English firths==

*Solway Firth (inlet with the rivers Eden, Esk and Nith).
**The &quot;Firth&quot; is off the Solway Coast.
**Places: Carlisle, England on the River Eden, Annan and Gretna, both in Scotland. Luce Bay, Wigtown, St Bees, Aspatria

==Firths outside Britain==
*Flensburg Firth, an inlet forming part of the border between Denmark and Germany
*Kiel Firth, an inlet between Danish Wold and Wagria that forms part of Kiel Bay
*The Firth of Thames is a bay at the mouth of the Waihou River (formerly named the Thames) in New Zealand
* Firth of Tay, Antarctica. Named in conjunction with neighbouring Dundee Island, as the original Firth of Tay adjoins Dundee.

<text>Radio programming is the process of organising a schedule of radio content for commercial broadcasting and public broadcasting by radio stations.

==History==
The original inventors of radio, from Guglielmo Marconi&#x27;s time on, expected it to be used for one-on-one wireless communication tasks where telephones and telegraphs could not be used because of the problems involved in stringing copper wires from one point to another, such as in ship-to-shore communications. Those inventors had no expectations whatever that radio would become a major mass media entertainment and information medium earning many millions of dollars in revenues annually through radio advertising commercials or sponsorship. These latter uses were brought about after 1920 by business entrepreneurs such as David Sarnoff, who created the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), and William S. Paley, who built Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). These broadcasting (as opposed to narrowcasting) business organizations began to be called network affiliates, because they consisted of loose chains of individual stations located in various cities, all transmitting the standard overall-system supplied fare, often at synchronised agreed-upon times. Some of these radio network stations were owned and operated by the networks, while others were independent radio owned by entrepreneurs allied with the respective networks. By selling blocks of time to advertisers, the medium was able to quickly become profitable and offer its products to listeners for free, provided they invested in a radio receiver set.

The new medium had grown rapidly through the 1930s, vastly increasing both the size of its audience and its profits. In those early days, it was customary for a corporation to sponsor an entire half-hour radio program, placing its commercials at the beginning and the end. This is in contrast to the pattern which developed late in the 20th century in both television and radio, where small slices of time were sold to many sponsors and no corporation claimed or wanted sponsorship of the entire show, except in rare cases. These later commercials also filled a much larger portion of the total program time than they had in the earlier days.

In the early radio age, content typically included a balance of comedy, drama, news, music and sports reporting. Variety radio programs included the most famous Hollywood talent of the day. During the 1920s, radio focused on musical entertainment, the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, has been focused on broadcasting country music since it began in 1925. Radio soap operas began in the U.S. in 1930 with &quot;Painted Dreams&quot;. &quot;Lørdagsbarnetimen&quot;, a Norwegian children&#x27;s show, with its premiere in 1924 interrupted only by the Second World War, was the longest running radio show in the world until it ceased production in 2010.

In the early 1950s, television programming eroded the popularity of radio comedy, drama and variety shows. By the late 1950s, radio broadcasting took on much the form it has today strongly focused on music, talk, news and sports, though drama can still be heard, especially on the BBC.

<doc id="103667" wikidata="Q532711" url="?curid=103667" title="Encinitas, California">
<text>Encinitas (Spanish for &quot;Small Oaks&quot;) is a beach city in the North County area of San Diego County, California, United States. Located in Southern California, it is approximately north of San Diego, between Solana Beach and Carlsbad, and about south of Los Angeles. As of the 2020 United States census, the city had a population of 62,007, up from 59,518 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
The first people to settle in Encinitas were the Kumeyaay. Gaspar de Portolá, governor of Baja California, visited the area in 1769 during the Portolá expedition and met residents from the nearby Kumeyaay village of Jeyal (or Heyal), near the San Elijo Lagoon. Portolá named the valley Los Encinos for the oak forest along El Camino Real, where there was also a village that was likely known as &quot;Hakutl&quot; in New Encinitas.

After Mexican Independence, land was granted to Andrés Ybarra in 1842 to build Rancho Las Encinitas in what is now Olivenhain and New Encinitas, from which Encinitas got its namesake. &quot;Encinitas&quot; is a Spanish name meaning &quot;little oaks&quot;.

The town of Old Encinitas was formed in 1881 by Jabez Pitcher.

The city was incorporated by 69.3% of the voters in 1986 from the communities of historic Encinitas, New Encinitas (Village Park, etc.), Leucadia, Cardiff-by-the-Sea, and Olivenhain.

==Geography ==

Encinitas lies on a rugged coastal terrace. The city is bisected by a low-lying coastal ridge that separates New and Old Encinitas. In the north of the city, the coast rises in elevation and the land is raised up in the form of many coastal bluffs, which are subject to collapsing on the narrow beach. The city is bounded by Batiquitos Lagoon to the north and San Elijo Lagoon to the south.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and of which (5.89%) is water. The city&#x27;s elevation ranges between sea level and above sea level.

=== Communities ===
Encinitas can be divided into various neighborhoods. Old Encinitas is a small beachside area featuring a mix of businesses and housing styles. Sitting along Coast Highway 101 (Historic US 101), the Encinitas welcome arch, the famous surf break Swamis, and the early 20th-century La Paloma Theatre are located here. Old Encinitas is divided from New Encinitas by a low coastal ridge.

Olivenhain is a semi-rural region in eastern Encinitas, composed of mostly single-family homes, a 4-H Club, and several private equestrian facilities. German immigrants established the Olivenhain Colony in the late 19th century under the Homestead Act of 1862. Olivenhain connects to Rancho Santa Fe via Encinitas Boulevard.

Leucadia is a coastal community of the city, featuring tree-lined streets and boulevards, art galleries, unusual stores, and restaurants, along with single-family homes and beaches such as Beacons and Grandview.

Cardiff-by-the-Sea is the southernmost oceanfront community, which features streets named after British cities and classical composers, the Lux Art Institute, and the San Elijo Campus of Mira Costa College.

===Surfing Madonna===

In 2011, Mark Patterson and Robert Nichols illegally installed a mosaic of a surfing Virgin de Guadalupe on the north concrete support wall of the train bridge on Encinitas Boulevard, leading to a battle over whether it should be removed or preserved. It was named &quot;the Surfing Madonna&quot; by the media and public.

===Museums and other points of interest===

The Lux Art Institute, San Dieguito Heritage Museum, and Encinitas Historical Society are located in Encinitas. Other points of interest include San Diego Botanic Garden, Self-Realization Fellowship temple and Hermitage, the historic La Paloma Theatre, Moonlight Beach, and one of California&#x27;s classic downtown areas along historic Coast Highway 101. Surfing is a popular activity in Encinitas, particularly at Swami&#x27;s, which is rated in the top five surf locations in the world and is mentioned in a verse of The Beach Boys&#x27; song &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot; The bronze statue &quot;Humanity&quot; by Maidy Morhous was installed at J Street Overview in 2018 as a donation from Sue and Jay Vicory. Manchester Reserve is great for nature walk and light hiking.

=== Cardiff Kook - Magic Carpet Ride ===
&quot;Magic Carpet Ride&quot;, affectionately known by Encinitas locals as the Cardiff Kook, is a bronze statue located in Cardiff-by-the-Sea. The San Diego Architectural Foundation, in its annual Orchids &amp; Onions awards for the best and worst architecture of the year, awarded the Kook an Onion in 2007. The nickname comes from a derogatory surfer slang term for a &quot;wannabe&quot; surfer, as surfers in the area realized that the statue&#x27;s form whilst &quot;surfing&quot; was far from correct. However, the Kook has become a local favorite in the city and has many wonderful traditions associated with it. At various times during the year, the Kook is &quot;vandalized&quot; and dressed up (wearing a lucha libre mask, being eaten by a papier-mâché shark, wearing a full Uncle Sam costume for Independence Day, used by local high school students to ask each other to school dances, etc.), bringing local flair and tourists constantly to the statue.

==Economy==
Since 1982, the Encinitas 101 Main Street Association has helped keep downtown Encinitas economically viable yet historic and beachy. Downtown Encinitas is vibrant and full of thriving local salons, restaurants, shops, bars, and art galleries.

==Transportation==
Coaster trains stop at Encinitas station multiple times a day, seven days a week, with service from Oceanside to San Diego. Between 2013 and 2017, Amtrak&#x27;s Pacific Surfliner also stopped here but discontinued the stop due to low ridership.

==Government==
=== Local government ===

The city is currently governed by a five-member city council, with a mayor and four council members. The mayor is elected citywide and the council members are elected by district to staggered four-year terms at two-year intervals. The deputy mayor is chosen by the city council members from among themselves.

In elections held in November 2012, Encinitas voted yes on ballot measures to allow them to directly elect its mayor, with term lengths of two years, rather than the mayor being chosen by members of the city council for one-year terms. The first such direct election for mayor took place in 2014.

The city has been repeatedly sued over policies that are allegedly aimed at undermining state affordable housing laws.

<text>Scouting in Ohio has a long history, from the 1908 to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.

==Early history (1910–1950)==

==Recent history (1950–1990)==
In 1952 and again in 1975 the National Order of the Arrow Conference was held at Miami University.

==Present Day (2016-)==
In 2016, an effort was started to consolidate councils in Northeast Ohio as of January 1, 2017. Heart of Ohio and Greater Western Reserve Councils&#x27; northern districts merged with Greater Cleveland Council. Heart of Ohio&#x27;s southern districts have merged with Buckeye Council. Greater Western Reserve Councils southern districts have merged with Great Trail Council.

Order of the Arrow Lodge mergers will be completed following the Section C-4A conclave in May at Camp Manatoc

==Boy Scouts of America in Ohio today==
In the 1990s, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) went through a restructuring in an attempt to reduce manpower, and in several states small historic Councils were merged into a larger &quot;supercouncil&quot;. The Simon Kenton Council is an example of such a supercouncil.

There are twelve Boy Scouts of America local councils in Ohio.

=== Allohak Council===
Allohak Council (#818) was founded in 1991. It was composed of six districts and served parts of West Virginia and Ohio. The council headquarters was in Parkersburg, West Virginia.
The Allohak Council was disbanded on December 31, 2018.

===Black Swamp Area Council===

Black Swamp Area Council was created in 1992. It is composed of six districts and covers thirteen counties in Ohio. The council headquarters is in Findlay, Ohio with an additional service center in Lima, Ohio.

==== History ====
In 1920, the Defiance Council (#446) was formed, in 1922 the Van Wert Council (#463) was formed, and in 1919 the Lima Council (#452) was formed. In 1926 Defiance, Lima and Van wert merged to form the Shawnee Area Council (#452). In 1923, the Hancock County Council (#449) was formed, and in 1915 the Tiffin Council was formed. In 1930, Hancock County and Tiffin merged to become the Put-Han-Sen Area Council (#449). In 1992, Shawnee Area and Put-Han-Sen Area merged to become the Black Swamp Area Council (#449).

===Dan Beard Council ===
Dan Beard Council was created in 1956. It is composed of seven districts and serves Scouts in twelve counties in southern Ohio and northern Kentucky. The council is served by the Ku-Ni-Eh Lodge of the Order of the Arrow.

====History====





The Middletown Area Council (#454) was first formed as a provisional (second class) council in 1917. In 1920 it was granted full council status. It initially served the city of Middletown. In 1928, the territory of the Middletown Area Council was expanded to include all of Warren County as well as Lemon, Liberty, Madison and Union Townships from Butler County. In 1926, the land for Camp Hook was donated to the council. The camp opened in 1927 and operated until 1991. In 1932 Union Township was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Butler County Council (later known as Fort Hamilton Council). In 1933 the Middletown Area Council was renamed to the Mound Builders Area Council. In 1955, jurisdiction of Lemon Township was transferred to Fort Hamilton Council, forming the final boundaries of the Mound Builders Area Council. Mound Builders Area Council continued to serve Warren County and the Lemon and Madison Townships of Butler County as well as all of Warren County until July 1, 1985 when it was absorbed into Dan Beard Council #438 and became the Mound Builders District. The current Hopewell District of Dan Beard Council, formed during the 2006 redistricting process when Middletown and Lemon Township (including Monroe, Ohio) were recombined, very closely resembling the lines of the old Mound Builders Area Council territory.

Mound Builders Area Council primarily had only two districts, Fort Ancient and Pokey Griffith. A third district, Wischixin, was formed briefly but lasted for less than 5 years before being discontinued.

The Nachenum Lodge #145 of the Order of the Arrow served Mound Builders Area Council, forming in 1939. Upon the merger with Dan Beard Council in 1985, the Ku-Ni-Eh Lodge #462 merged with Nachenum, forming Ku-Ni-Eh Lodge #145 (keeping the existing Dan Beard Council name but choosing to use the lower lodge # of the former Nachenum Lodge).

Mound Builders Area Council, while no longer an actual council, was represented at the 1985 National Jamboree. The troop contingent from Mound Builders Council attended the jamboree, held beginning July 15, while the council itself ceased to exist on July 1. The contingent was technically now part of Dan Beard Council, though all patches and markings, etc. were already set to the old Mound Builders Area Council and were not altered to note Dan Beard Council.

=====Organization=====

In late 2021, the Dan Beard Council announced a district realignment effort, partly based on local school district boundaries. On February 9, 2022, the new district names were announced.

*Fort Hamilton District (representing Butler County)

=====Camps=====

Camp Michaels is located in Union, KY, on of land, offering primitive outdoor facilities. of additional land was dedicated on September 19, 2008.

The Dan Beard Scout Reservation, in Loveland, OH, consists of three areas on its campus. Camp Friedlander was established in 1919, and reopened in 2002 after renovations to the camp. Friedlander has 23 campsites, a 600-person dining hall, an lake, cabins, and a swimming pool. It has an excellent reputation and attracts Scouts from all over the world. Camp Craig is often used as a training facility. The Program Building at Camp Craig is often rented out for retreats, conferences or training. The swimming pool at Camp Craig is shared with Cub World. Cub Scout Adventure World (Cub World) opened in 2000 as a camp designed exclusively for Cub Scouting. Cub World features two large buildings that offer dorm-like accommodations (Pioneer Fort and Medieval Castle) that offer rooms with bunk-beds, and more primitive areas (Mountain Man Village and Miner&#x27;s Camp) that offer tent camping. All three camps have access to each other on the Reservation, which is adjacent to the Little Miami River.

Camp Charles R. Hook, founded in 1926, was in operation until 1991. In 1997, the land was purchased by the Five Rivers Metroparks and is now called the Twin Creek Metropark. The land for Camp Hook was donated by the family of Charles R. Hook, who was the President of the American Rolling Mill Company (ARMCO) (which in the early 1990s merged to become AK Steel Corporation), and son-in-law of the company&#x27;s founder, George M. Verity. In early 1929 Mr. Hook donated a significant amount of stock to the Middletown Area Council with the instructions to immediately sell it and use the proceeds to put in a swimming pool at the camp. The timing on this event was advantageous considering early in the fall of 1929 was the crash of the stock market and the beginning of the Great Depression. The sale of the stock yielded enough money to put in the swimming pool and purchase more land to the north, expanding the camp&#x27;s size significantly. The waterfront of the camp was later named Lake George after Charles Hook&#x27;s son, George Verity Hook. After the camp&#x27;s closure and sale to the Metroparks system, the majority of the structures were torn down and the swimming pool filled in. Most of the campsites have grown over as well, but many landmarks or signs of the former use of the area remain. The Metroparks system maintains three group campsites for Scout use, and a backcountry camping area was added on the north side of the property near Chamberlain Road. A large rock with embedded plaque thanking the Hooks for the donation remains, as does the amphitheatre campfire bowl, the Administration Lodge, the Maintenance Building, the Chapel (now called the Natuary) and a few other structures that are in ruins. The pool pump house and the shelters for the shooting ranges still remain, though it is believed this is due only because the demolition equipment could not safely reach these structures. The park previously held three geocache units that contain historical pictures of the old camp, but as of fall 2013 they have been removed. One point of interest that remains is the Gilwell Tree. A local Scouting family in the 1970s took a vacation to England with his family, during which they visited Gilwell Park, the home of the Scouting movement. A sapling of one of the English Oaks was brought back from Gilwell Park and planted at Camp Hook to signify the ties between Scouting in the US and the worldwide movement. In June, 1986, Camp Hook hosted EC 336 X, an experimental Wood Badge Course directed by William Hillcourt. (Very little is known about this course.) In 2010 a plaque, and a split rail fence were created to honor the tree and one of the leading, and oldest, scout leaders in the Council. It was an Eagle Scout Service Project.

=====Trails=====
The Riverwalk Trail spans downtown Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky (Covington and Newport). The trail can be hiked in 2 configurations: the first () meets a requirement for the 2nd Class rank, while the second () satisfies one of the requirements for the Hiking Merit Badge. Highlights along the trail include the boyhood home of Dan Beard. There is a patch available from the Council for walking the trail. The Trail Guide for the Dan Beard Riverwalk Trail can be found on the Dan Beard Council website.
The Silver Moccasin Trail originally started in Lebanon and finished at Fort Ancient. It was long and used to offer a medal and a patch. A portion of the trail was reconstructed from Fort Ancient south to Morgan&#x27;s Riverside Campground off of Mason-Morrow-Millgrove Rd, then crossing the Little Miami River to join the Little Miami Scenic Trail to complete the loop. This restored loop is long.
The Thunderbird Trail existed as a 6-mile (9.7-km) long loop around Camp Hook. It was in use for many years during the camp&#x27;s time as a part of Mound Builders Area Council and Dan Beard Council. Scouts could earn a patch upon completing the entire trail. After the sale of the camp to the Five Rivers MetroParks system in 1997, the Thunderbird trail stopped being maintained and now no longer exists except to those who remember exactly where it was, although the trail markers and Order of the Arrow (OA) fire-rings are still visible and somewhat accessible.

====Order of the Arrow====




The Ku-Ni-Eh Lodge #145 was originally a pre-OA society called the Tribe of Ku-Ni-Eh, founded in 1922 at Camp Friedlander by then Camp Director Arther E. Roberts. Ku-Ni-Eh means &quot;Order of Manood&quot; in the Maidu tongue. It became popular throughout the region and was incorporated at other camps. However, it was not officially recognized by the BSA National organization, and eventually was phased out for the Order of the Arrow. In 1951, the original Tribe of Ku-Ni-Eh group at the Cincinnati Area Council converted to become the Order of the Arrow Lodge #462.

It remained Ku-Ni-Eh Lodge #462 after the Cincinnati Council merged with the Northern Kentucky Council to become Dan Beard Council in 1956, absorbing Michikinaqua Lodge #155, and again absorbing Mich-Kini-Kwa Lodge #306 when Fort Hamilton Council was merged with Dan Beard Council in 1959.

When Mound Builders Area Council merged with Dan Beard Council in 1985, it was decided to keep the Ku-Ni-Eh name, but use the Nachenum Lodge&#x27;s lower number of #145, resulting in the founding of Ku-Ni-Eh #145.

Today Ku-Ni-Eh Lodge #145 serves the scouts and scouters of Dan Beard Council and calls Camp Friedlander its home. It typically performs three Ordeal ceremonies per year, with one being held at Dan Beard&#x27;s northern kentucky property, Camp Michaels.

With the reorganization of the National OA structure in 2022, Ku-Ni-Eh lodge was moved from Section C-6B to section E-2.

Camp Stigwandish was added to the Council in January 2017, when Greater Western Reserve Council was split and merged with Greater Cleveland and Great Trail Councils. Camp Stigwandish was the oldest operational camp in the Lake Erie Council. Northeast Ohio Council opened the Camp for summer programs in 1930, but it was opened to weekend camping in 1929. Camp Stigwandish will serve as the council&#x27;s Cub Day camp and also help out with the Beaumont Scout Reservation summer camp program. Stigwandish is the primary home to scouters in Lake, Geauga and Ashtabula Counties. Camp Stigwandish is located in Madison Ohio and offers over 20 campsites, 6 cabins, 5 ranges (Rifle, Shotgun, Archery Range, Wrist Rocket Range and a separate Cub Scout Archery Range,) 3 Lakes including Bass Lake, Canoe Lake and Indian Lake. Indian Lake along with a small pond off the parking lot called Salamander Pond are the oldest body of water on the property. The property also has a low COPE course, trading post, dining hall, training center, nature center, Chapel and more. The camp sits on the banks of Mill Creek and is over 300 acres. 120 of them being able to be sold the rest are in a land conservancy or were sold to the Soil and Water conservations in the 1990s. While only 12 miles in between Beaumont Scout Reservation and Camp Stigwandish the terrain is extremely different. The camp is often referred to the hidden jewel of the council. In 2019, an assessment was conducted in which Camp Stigwandish was found to be unsustainable for Lake Erie Council to continue to operate. On June 18, 2020, Lake Erie Council transferred Camp Stigwandish to Ross Road LLC for a total of 1.6 million dollars. The Spirit of Camp Stigwandish will continue to live on.

Campsites for Camp Stigwandish include, Dead Horse Ridge, Grand River, Solitude, Pop Corey, 3 Eagles Nest Campsites, Adventure, Johnny Appleseed, Pioneer Village, Woodcrafters, Dan Beard, Dan Boon, Kit Carson, Ted Mullans, Tecumseh, Paul Bunyan, Iroquois, a staff site to the east of the Baden Powell Lodge, and 3 adirondacks.

Firelands Scout Reservation was added to the council in January, 2017 after Heart of Ohio Council merged with the legacy Greater Cleveland Council to form the new Lake Erie Council. Firelands is home to 2 camps, Camp Avery Hand, and Camp Wyandot. Both camps will now be used all year around for scouters to use. The reservation is mainly used for NYLT, Scoutmaster Training, and Cub Scout activities.

Tinnerman Wilderness Canoe Base, more commonly known as Tinnerman Canoe Base, was a &quot;high-adventure base&quot; located on the banks of the French River, in Ontario. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the French River area was a major trade route used to exchange furs trapped in the West with various goods made in the East and in Europe. Tinnerman is nicknamed the &quot;Land of the Joli Voyageur&quot;. The land that the Tinnerman base is located on was owned by Albert H. Tinnerman, inventor of the speed nut. After Mr. Tinnerman&#x27;s passing in 1961, his grandson Bill Buttriss of Cleveland Ohio tried to obtain a commercial license for the camp. The Ontario government said that any one area would support only so many camps and they felt the lower French had enough camps at that time. Though appealed, a license was not possible for the camp. It was at this time the family decided to donate the camp to the Cleveland Area Scout Council. Two weeks after the formal donation, Mr. Buttriss received a letter from the Ontario government stating that since one of the camps in the area had closed its doors (Rainbow Lodge on Bass Creek), the license would now be available.

From 1963 to 2011, the base was owned and operated by the Greater Cleveland Council. In 2011, citing a lack of attendance and other factors, the Greater Cleveland Council permanently closed Tinnerman Canoe Base and put it up for sale. Distraught Tinnerman alumni created a detailed proposal for a non-profit Tinnerman Foundation, to keep the camp operating as a canoe base for youthful explorers. On February 21, 2012 the Greater Cleveland Council announced that &quot;the executive board of Greater Cleveland Council, Boy Scouts of America voted to unanimously accept a cash offer of $415,000 for the property on the French River in Ontario, Canada that was the Tinnerman Wilderness Canoe Base. The purchase offer has no contingencies and is expected to be completed in early May 2012.&quot;

The property known as Camp Kootaga was purchased in 1922 by Don B. Lowe under the Gim-O-Gash tribe of the Boy Scouts of America. The first long-term summer camp was held that year on the banks of the Hughes River in the Kootaga region. This camp consisted of one or two Troops from the Parkersburg area with Don B. Lowe as the Camp Director during the early years. In 1929 Col. R. L. Cole brought a Kiowa Indian named J. Dougannah to help with the camp program. He gave Indian names to the Leaders and named the Boy Scout camp &quot;Kootaga&quot; which means &quot;Good Friends.&quot; Through the years, Camp Kootaga has gone through many changes, but one thing has remained constant: helping develop young men into upstanding citizens and outstanding individuals.

Camp Mahonegon, sitting of approximately 500 acres in Upshur County, is the second camp in the Allohak Council. Though no longer used as an active summer camp, Mahonegon has remained an active part of the council. It is used for many council events yearly, and continues to be a focal point for scouting activity. The First Summer Camp was held in 1948. The last Summer Camp was held in 1980.

<text>The master race (, ) is a pseudoscientific concept in Nazi ideology, in which the putative Aryan race is deemed the pinnacle of human racial hierarchy. Members were referred to as master humans (, ).

The Nazi theorist Alfred Rosenberg believed that the &quot;Nordic race&quot; was descended from Proto-Indo-Europeans, who he thought had pre-historically dwelt on the North German Plain and may have ultimately originated on the lost island of Atlantis. The Nazis declared that the Aryans were superior to all other races, and believed they were entitled to expand territorially. The actual policy that was implemented by the Nazis resulted in the Aryan certificate. This document, which was required by law for all citizens of the Reich, was the &quot;Lesser Aryan certificate&quot; (&quot;Kleiner Ariernachweis&quot;) and could be obtained through an &quot;Ahnenpass&quot;, which required the owner to trace their lineage through baptism, birth certificates, or certified proof thereof that all grandparents were of &quot;Aryan descent&quot;.

The Slavs, Roma, and Jews were defined as being racially inferior and non-Aryan &quot;Untermenschen&quot;, and were thus considered a danger to the Aryan or Germanic master race. According to the Nazi secret Hunger Plan and &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;, the Slavic population was to be removed from Central Europe through expulsion, enslavement, starvation, and extermination, except for a small percentage who were deemed to be non-Slavic descendants of Germanic settlers, and thus suitable for Germanisation.

==Historical background==
The 18th century saw the first attempts to establish a racial divide between &quot;masters&quot; and &quot;slaves&quot;, or the belief that a nation&#x27;s ruling class is biologically superior to its ruled subjects. In his book &quot;History of the Ancient Government of France&quot;, published posthumously in 1727, Henri de Boulainvilliers attempted to prove that in France, the nobility represented the descendants of the old Frankish ruling class. In contrast, the majority of the population descended from the subject Gauls. As a result, two qualitatively different races faced off, and the only way to abolish the Franks&#x27; superiority was to destroy their civilization. Classical liberal theorists such as Volney and Sieyès refuted this theory by demonstrating that the French nobility was primarily composed of nouveaux riches from all over the country. Thus, the concept of a racially pure Frankish lineage was false.

In 1855, French count Arthur de Gobineau published his infamous work &quot;An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races&quot;. Expanding upon Boulainvilliers&#x27; use of ethnography to defend the Ancien Régime against the Third Estate&#x27;s claims, Gobineau divides the human species into three major groups: white, yellow and black, claiming that &quot;history springs only from contact with the white races&quot;. He considers the Aryan race to be the pinnacle of human development, serving as the basis of all European aristocracies. However, inevitable miscegenation led to the &quot;downfall of civilizations&quot;.

Gobineau&#x27;s influence was minimal at first. In his letters to Alexis de Tocqueville, he complained that his book was getting little attention in France and was only having an impact in the United States. Despite his friendship with Gobineau Tocqueville rejected the book, explaining that it was in accordance with the interests of slave owners in the Southern states. However, in the 1880s, the book gained popularity in Germany thanks to Cosima Wagner&#x27;s efforts. In 1899, Houston Stewart Chamberlain, a Germanophile Englishman and Cosima Wagner&#x27;s son-in-law, published &quot;The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century&quot;. Expanding on Gobineau&#x27;s earlier theories, he argued that the Teutonic peoples had a profound influence on Western civilization. Chamberlain classified all European peoples, including Germans, Celts, Slavs, Greeks, and Latins, as the &quot;Aryan race&quot;, which was built on ancient Proto-Indo-European culture. He saw the Nordic or Teutonic peoples as the leaders of the Aryan race, and essentially all races.

The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche introduced the concept of &quot;Übermensch&quot;, which translates to &quot;Overman&quot; or &quot;Superman&quot;. In his 1883 book Also Sprach Zarathustra: Ein Buch für Alle und Keinen (&quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None&quot;), he proposed the idea of the &quot;Übermensch&quot; as a goal for humanity. However, Nietzsche never developed the concept based on race. Instead, the &quot;Übermensch&quot; &quot;seems to be the ideal aim of spiritual development more than a biological goal&quot;. Nazism distorted the concept&#x27;s real meaning to suit its &quot;master race&quot; ideology.

By the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it was believed that Indo-Europeans (generally referred to as Aryans) were the highest branch of humanity due to their technological advancement. This reasoning was simultaneously linked with Nordicism, which claimed that the &quot;Nordic race&quot; was the &quot;purest&quot; form of the Aryan race. Today, this view is regarded as a form of scientific racism. It contradicts the belief in racial equality by advocating the view that one race is superior to all other races.

===Eugenics===
Eugenics came to play a prominent role in this racial thought as a way to improve and maintain the purity of the Aryan master race. Many thinkers in the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s adhered to Eugenics, such as Margaret Sanger, Marie Stopes, H. G. Wells, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, Madison Grant, Émile Zola, George Bernard Shaw, John Maynard Keynes, John Harvey Kellogg, Linus Pauling, and Sidney Webb.

In 1908, the Louisiana State Fair hosted the first &quot;Better Babies&quot; competition. Babies were judged based on livestock standards such as height, weight, unblemished skin, well-formed fingers, lack of excess fat, and cooperative behavior. The intent was to establish child-breeding health standards. Beginning in 1920, at the Kansas State Fair, a &quot;Fitter Family&quot; contest, sponsored by the American Eugenics Society&#x27;s Committee on Popular Education, required family members to submit an &quot;Abridged Records of Family Traits&quot; and then undergo physical and psychological examinations to determine their &quot;fitness&quot;, or eugenic health. Contests received letter grades, and the winners—almost always white and of Western and Northern European descent—were awarded trophies. Some years later, beginning in 1935, contestants in the Miss America contest were required to be &quot;of the white race&quot; and to submit a detailed account of their ancestry; those with backgrounds connected to the Pilgrims&#x27; arrival on the Mayflower or the American Revoluationary War had an advantage.

The Nazis took this concept to an extreme by establishing a program to systematically genetically enhance the Nordic Aryans themselves through a program of Nazi eugenics, based on the eugenics laws of the US state of California, to create a super race.

===Hierarchy===
The modern concept of the &quot;master race&quot; is generally derived from a 19th-century racial theory, which posited a hierarchy of races that was based on darkness of skin colour. This 19th-century concept was initially developed by Count Joseph Arthur De Gobineau. Gobineau&#x27;s basic concept, as further refined and developed in Nazism, placed black Indigenous Australians and Equatorial Africans at the bottom of the hierarchy, while white Northern and Western Europeans (which consisted of Germans, Swedes, Icelanders, Norwegians, Danes, British, Irish, Dutch, Belgian and Northern French) were placed at its top; olive skinned white Southern Europeans (who consisted of Southern French, Portuguese, Spaniards, Italians, Romanians, and Greeks, i.e., those who were called the Mediterranean race, were regarded as another sub-race of the Caucasian race) and placed in its upper middle ranks; and the Semitic and Hamitic races (supposed sub-races of the Caucasian race) were placed in its lower-middle ranks (because the Jews, were Semites, the Nazis believed their cleverness made them extremely dangerousthey had their own plan for Jewish world domination, a conspiracy which needed to be opposed by all thoughtful Aryans). Slavs such as Poles and Russians were not considered Aryans; and neither were the members of the Mongoloid race (including its offshoots such as Malayans, American Indians) and mixed-race people such as s, the bronze Mestizos, Mulattos, Afro-Asians, and Zambos were placed in its lower middle ranks. However, the Japanese were considered honorary Aryans.
In their attempt to scientifically prove the racial inferiority of Slavs, German (and Austrian) racial scientists were forced to gloss over their findings which consistently proved that Early Slavs were dolicocephalic and fair haired, i.e., &quot;Nordic&quot;, while the South Slavic &quot;Dinaric&quot; sub-race was often viewed favourable. Nazis used the term &quot;Slavic race&quot;, and considered Slavs to be non-Aryan. The concept of a Slavic &quot;Untermensch&quot; accompanied their political goals, and it was particularly aimed at Poles and Russians. Germany&#x27;s immediate goal was &quot;Drang nach Osten&quot; or expansion into the East, which was the first phase in its ultimate plan to conquer Europe, and Ukraine&#x27;s &quot;chernozem&quot; (black earth) soil was regarded as a particularly desirable zone for colonization by the &quot;Herrenvolk&quot; () (&quot;master people&quot;).

In relation to the Nazis&#x27; belief in racial purity, author and historian Lucy Dawidowicz wrote:

==&quot;Master race&quot; in the United States==
=== Origins and context ===
In the United States, the concept of &#x27;master race&#x27; arose within the context of master-slave race relations in the slavery-based society of historical America – particularly in the South in the mid-19th century. It was based upon both the experience of slavery and the pseudo-scientific justifications for racial slavery, but also on the relations between whites in the South and North, particularly during the American Civil War.

=== First occurrences ===
Benjamin W. Leigh, representing Virginia in the United States Senate, said in a speech of January 19, 1836:
There has been in Virginia as earnest a desire to abolish slavery as exists any where at this day. It commenced with the Revolution, and many of our ablest and most influential men were active in recommending it, and in devising plans for the accomplishment of it. The Legislature encouraged and facilitated emancipation by the owners, and many slaves were so emancipated. The leaning of the courts of justice was always &quot;in favorem libertatis&quot;. This disposition continued until the impracticability of effecting a general emancipation, without incalculable mischief to the master race, and danger of utter destruction to the other, and the evils consequent on partial emancipations, became too obvious to the Legislature, and to the great majority of the people, to be longer disregarded.

The Oxford English Dictionary records that William J. Grayson used the phrase &quot;master race&quot; in his poem &quot;The Hireling and the Slave&quot; (1855):
&lt;poem&gt;
For these great ends hath Heaven’s supreme command
Brought the black savage from his native land,
Trains for each purpose his barbarian mind,
By slavery tamed, enlightened, and refined;
Instructs him, from a master-race, to draw
Wise modes of polity and forms of law,
Imbues his soul with faith, his heart with love,
Shapes all his life by dictates from above
&lt;/poem&gt;

where the phrase denotes the relation between the white masters and negro slaves.

By 1860 Virginian author George Fitzhugh was using the &quot;challenging phrase &#x27;master race&#x27;, which soon came to mean considerably more than the ordinary master-slave relationship&quot;. Fitzhugh, along with a number of southern writers, used the term to differentiate Southerners from Northerners, based on the dichotomy that Southerners were supposedly descendants of Normans / Cavaliers whereas Northerners were descendants of Anglo-Saxons / Puritans.

=== Uses of the concept ===
In 1861, the Southern press bragged that Northern soldiers would &quot;encounter a master race&quot; and knowledge of this fact would cause Northern soldiers&#x27; &quot;knees to tremble&quot;. The &quot;Richmond Whig&quot; in 1862 proclaimed that &quot;the master race of this continent is found in the southern states&quot;, and in 1863 the &quot;Richmond Examiner&quot; stated that &quot;there are slave races born to serve, master races born to govern&quot;.

In the works of John H. Van Evrie, a Northern supporter of the Confederacy, the term was interchangeable with white supremacy, notably in &quot;White Supremacy and Negro Subordination, Or, Negroes a Subordinate Race and (so-called) slavery its normal condition&quot; (1861). In &quot;Subgeneation: the theory of the normal relations of the races; an answer to miscegenation&quot; (1864) Van Evrie created the words &quot;subgen&quot; to describe what he considered to be the &quot;inferior races&quot; and &quot;subgeneation&quot; to describe the ‘normal’ relation of such inferior races to whites, something which he considered to be the &quot;very corner-stone of democracy&quot;; but these words never entered the dictionary.

The racial term &quot;Untermensch&quot; originates from the title of Klansman Lothrop Stoddard&#x27;s 1922 book &quot;The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man&quot;. It was later adopted by the Nazis from that book&#x27;s German version &quot;Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen&quot; (1925). An advocate of the U.S. immigration laws that favored Northern Europeans, Stoddard wrote primarily on the alleged dangers posed by &quot;coloured&quot; peoples to white civilization, with his most famous book &quot;The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy&quot; in 1920. Alfred Rosenberg was the leading Nazi who attributed the concept of the East-European &quot;under man&quot; to Stoddard. As the Nazi Party&#x27;s chief racial theorist, Rosenberg oversaw the construction of a human racial &quot;ladder&quot; that justified Hitler&#x27;s racial and ethnic policies. Referring to Russian communists, Rosenbeg wrote in his &quot;Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts&quot; (1930) that &quot;this is the kind of human being that Lothrop Stoddard has called the &#x27;under man.&#x27;&quot; [&quot;...den Lothrop Stoddard als &#x27;Untermenschen&#x27; bezeichnete.&quot;]

==Nordicism==

The origins of the Nazi version of the master race theory were in the 19th-century racial theories of Count Joseph Arthur De Gobineau, who argued that cultures degenerated when distinct races mixed. It was believed at this time that the peoples of Southern Europe were racially mixed with the non-European Moors from across the Mediterranean Sea, while the peoples of Northern Europe and Western Europe remained pure. Proponents of the Nordicism further argued that Nordic peoples had developed an innate toughness and determination due to the harsh, challenging climate in which they evolved.

The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer was one of the earliest proponents of a theory presenting a hierarchical racial model of history, attributing civilisational primacy to the &quot;white races&quot; who gained their sensitivity and intelligence by refinement in the rigorous north.

The highest civilisation and culture, apart from the Ancient Indians and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmins, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is because necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilisation.

Despite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, supporting the abolitionist movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of &quot;[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave master&#x27;s] devilish clutches&quot; as &quot;belonging to the blackest pages of mankind&#x27;s criminal record&quot;.

Hans Frank, Hitler&#x27;s personal lawyer, stated that Hitler carried a copy of Schopenhauer&#x27;s book &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; with him wherever he went throughout World War I.
The postulated superiority of these people was said to make them born leaders, or a &quot;master race&quot;. Other authors included Guido von List, his associate Lanz von Liebenfels, and the British-born German racial theorist Houston Stewart Chamberlain, all of whom felt that the white race in general, and Germanic peoples in particular, were superior to others, given the purification of both the white race and the German people from the other races which were &quot;polluting&quot; them, a new millenarian age of Aryan god-men would arrive.

Nazi policy stressed the superiority of the Germanic &quot;Übermenschen&quot; (&quot;superhuman&quot;) Nordic race, a sub-race of the white Caucasian race European population defined by anthropometric models of racial difference. The Nordic race was said to comprise only of the Germanic peoples: Scandinavians and the rest of the Nordic countries (Norwegians, Swedes, Danes, Icelanders, and Faroese), ethnic Germans (including Austrians, Banat Swabians, as well as Sudeten, Baltic and Volga Germans), Alemannic Swiss, Liechtensteiners, Luxembourgers, the Dutch, Flemings, Afrikaners, Frisians and the English.

The Nazi racial theorist Hans F. K. Günther first defined &quot;Nordic thought&quot; in his programmatic book &quot;Der Nordische Gedanke unter den Deutschen&quot;. The fact that Germans were not purely Nordic was acknowledged by Günther in his book &quot;Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes&quot; (&quot;Racial Science of the German People&quot;) from 1922, in which he described the German people as being made up of all five of his European racial categories: Nordic, Mediterranean, Dinaric, Alpine, and East Baltic. Most official Nazi comments on the Nordic race were based on Günther&#x27;s works, and Alfred Rosenberg presented Günther with a medal for his work in anthropology.

Although the physical ideal of these racial theorists was typically the tall, fair-haired, and light-eyed Nordic individual, such theorists accepted the fact that a considerable variety of hair and eye colour existed within the racial categories they recognised. For example, Adolf Hitler and many Nazi officials had dark hair and were still considered members of the Aryan race under Nazi racial doctrine, because the determination of an individual&#x27;s racial type depended on a preponderance of many characteristics in an individual rather than on just one defining feature.

Hitler and Himmler planned to use the SS as the basis for the racial &quot;regeneration&quot; of Europe following the final victory of Nazism. The SS was to be a racial elite chosen on the basis of &quot;pure&quot; Nordic qualities.

Giuseppe Sergi (1841–1936) was an Italian anthropologist of the early twentieth century, best known for his opposition to Nordicism in his books on the racial identity of ancient Mediterranean peoples. His concept of the Mediterranean race became important to the modelling of racial difference in the early twentieth century.

==Aryanism and Nazism==
The term Aryan is derived from the Sanskrit word (ā́rya), which is derived from &quot;arya&quot;, the original Indo-Iranian autonym. Also, the word &quot;Iran&quot; (from Middle Persian &quot;Ērān&quot;, &quot;the &quot;Ēr&quot;s&quot;) is the Persian word for [the land/place of] the &quot;Aryans&quot;.

Following the ideas of Gobineau and others, the Nazi theorist Alfred Rosenberg determined that these people, who, he claimed, were originally from Atlantis, were a dynamic warrior people who dwelt in northern climates on the North German Plain in prehistoric times, from which they migrated southeast by riding their chariots, eventually reaching Ukraine, Iran, and then India. They were supposed to be the ancestors of the ancient Germanic tribes, who shared their warrior values. Rosenberg opposed Christianity because to him, it was an alien Semitic slave-morality which was inappropriate for the warrior Aryan master race and in its place, he supported a melange of aspects of Hindu Vedic and Zoroastrian teachings (both of these religions were organised by Aryans), along with pre-Christian European Odinistic paganism, which he also considered distinctively Aryan in character.

In Nazi Germany, the Nuremberg Race Laws of 1935 forbade sexual relations and marriage between an &quot;Aryan&quot; and a &quot;non-Aryan&quot; in order to maintain the purity of the Aryan race. Such relations became a punishable crime which was known as &quot;Rassenschande&quot; or &quot;racial shame&quot;. The League of German Girls was particularly required to instruct girls to avoid &quot;Rassenschande&quot; because according to Nazism, maintaining racial purity was particularly important for young females. Aryans found guilty of this crime could face incarceration in a concentration camp, while non-Aryans could even face the death penalty. The Nazis recognized the Germanic people as the master race, and several policies were implemented in order to improve and maintain the Germanic-Nordic ubermenschen Aryan &quot;master race,&quot; including the practice of eugenics. In order to eliminate &quot;defective&quot; citizens and rid the country of the intellectually disabled or those who were born with genetic deficiencies, as well as those who were deemed racially inferior, the T-4 Euthanasia Program was administered by Karl Brandt, one of Hitler&#x27;s personal physicians. Additionally, a program of compulsory sterilisation was also implemented and as a result of it, forced operations were performed on hundreds of thousands of individuals. Many of these policies are generally seen as being related to what eventually became known as the Holocaust.

The Nazis also undertook measures to increase the number of Nordics in Germany. The Lebensborn program was only open to German women who fit the Nordic profile. During the Nazi occupation of Poland, the Nazis took young Nordic-looking Polish children who were classified as being descended from ethnic German settlers in order to determine whether or not they were &quot;racially valuable&quot;. If that were the case, the young children were taken back to these Lebensborn houses so they could be raised as Germans.

In Nazi Germany, the Aryan certificate was an official document which certified that its owner was an Aryan. Aryan certificates could also be obtained by citizens of other countries. In its section which is titled &quot;Racial Tenet&quot; (&quot;Rassegrundsatz&quot;), the Aryan certificate states:

For the &quot;Greater Aryan certificate&quot; Germans had to prove that as far back as January 1, 1800 &quot;none of their paternal nor their maternal ancestors had Jewish or coloured blood&quot;. SS officers had to prove this reaching back to 1750.

During a speech he made in 1936, Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels said:

In 1943, &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; for Ukraine Erich Koch reminded Germans:

==Yamato and Japan==

During the Meiji era, a sense of superiority over other Asians existed in the Japanese society, with discrimination being enacted against even against racial minorities such as the Ryūkyū and Ainu peoples. In July 1943, promotion of Yamato racial superiority was further affirmed by the Japanese government with the publishing of &quot;An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus&quot;.

==Mediterranean race==
The claim that the Mediterranean race was responsible for the most important of ancient Western civilisations was a problem for the promoters of Nordic superiority. According to Giuseppe Sergi, the Mediterranean race was the &quot;greatest race of the world&quot; and was singularly responsible for the most accomplished civilisations of ancient times, including those of Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Greece, Phoenicia, Carthage, and Rome. The Mediterranean race was also a major influence to the outside world in the modern era: during the 16th century, Spain and Portugal established the first global empires in Western history, placing both nations on the highest level of political and economic powers in Europe.

Charles Gabriel Seligman also stated that &quot;it must, I think, be recognised that the Mediterranean race has actually more achievements to its credit than any other race, since it is responsible for by far the greater part of Mediterranean civilisation, certainly before 1000 BC (and probably much later), and so shaped not only the Aegean cultures, but those of Western as well as the greater part of Eastern Mediterranean lands, while the culture of their near relatives, the Hamitic pre-dynastic Egyptians, formed the basis of that of Egypt.&quot;

The Nazis explained this by claiming that the original Latins and Greeks were Indo-European Nordic tribes which had migrated into Italy and Greece, during the Iron Age era. The Nazis also claimed that the Spanish and Portuguese Empires were examples of Nordic power since, at the time, their governments were run by the descendants of the Germanic Visigoths who invaded Spain and Portugal fifteen centuries earlier.
However, they did admit that the masses of people who lived during the flowering of these four civilizations were Mediterranean. This led to Germans of all European races to be classified as Aryans.

==Cultural influences==
Aryan master race ideology was common throughout the educated intellectual community and literate strata of the Western world until the post-World War II era. Such theories were commonplace in early-20th century fantasy literature.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the original &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; stories and newspaper cartoons, Buck Rogers, in his adventures in the 25th century that takes place on Earth, depicts him fighting for &quot;Aryan-Americans&quot; from the liberated zone around Niagara, New York, against the &quot;Red Mongol Empire,&quot; a Chinese empire of the future which rules most of North America.

In the 1930s, both educational and storybooks for children in Germany taught their readers about the master race. In the &quot;Sun Koh&quot; science fiction series, the protagonist Koh says things like &quot;My forefathers were Aryan&quot;, and in a story about Atlantis, he says, &quot;If our Atlantis once again rises out of the sea, then we will get from there the blond, steel-hard men with the pure blood and will create with them the master race, which will finally rule the earth.&quot; The German writer Michael Ende, who was born in 1929 and grew up reading such books, wrote his classic novel &quot;Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver&quot; in the 1950s, as a way of opposing the Nazi propaganda he was taught as a child. &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; writer Julia Voss wrote a book on Jim Button, uncovering Ende&#x27;s many references to Nazi symbols in that book. Voss shows how Ende upends the Nazi belief that Atlantis was the original home of the Aryan race by creating his own submerged city and making it rise, but not to restore Aryan master-race rule over the Earth, rather it becomes a multi-racial paradise with Jim Button, who is black and a descendant of the Magi Caspar, as its king.

In the 1948 film &quot;Rope&quot; by Alfred Hitchcock, one of the central characters, Brandon Shaw, is a firm believer in the master race ideology.

In the &quot;Doctor Who series,&quot; the Doctor&#x27;s frequent enemies, the Daleks, consider themselves a master race which must purge the universe of all other life forms; Terry Nation explicitly modeled them on the Nazis. In the 2009 special &quot;The End of Time&quot;, when the Master transforms the entire human race into copies of himself, he claims that there is no human race, but only &quot;the Master race&quot;.

In the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, while the parallels were not originally intentional, there is much similarity between Lord Voldemort&#x27;s &quot;pureblood&quot; ideology and the master race ideology of the Nazis, with wizards being &quot;pure&quot; and anyone with Muggle (non-wizard) blood being considered &quot;half-blood&quot; or &quot;mudblood&quot;, a word used and treated the same way a racial slur would be in the real world (Neo-Nazis call non-white people &quot;mud people&quot;).

In the film &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot;, the Master Race is a criminal organization of corrupt Afrikaner diplomatic officials from South Africa, led by South African consul-general in Los Angeles named Arjen Rudd that smuggles illegal gold krugerrands into the United States of America via Los Angeles Harbor.

<text>Scouting in Maryland has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving millions of youth with activities that have adapted to the changing cultural environment but have always been rooted in an active outdoor program.

==Early history (1910-1950)==
Scouting in Maryland dates back to the earliest days of the movement. Robert S. Garrett (1875–1961) was among the
twenty-five men who organized the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America in 1910. Mr. Garrett was a Baltimore civic leader, prominent philanthropist, explorer and Olympic champion. Named in the federal charter of 1916, Mr. Garrett served on the BSA National Executive Board from 1912 to 1919 and remained a member of the National Council until his death. He was one of the original nine Baltimore recipients of the Silver Beaver Award in 1931.

The first seven Scout Troops in Baltimore were granted charters by Scout Commissioner H. Laurance Eddy (1884–1962) on September 9, 1910. (Eddy&#x27;s role as Scout Commissioner was the combined predecessor to the roles of Council Commissioner and Council Scout Executive.) A month prior, Robert Garrett and Laurance Eddy ensured that a patrol of eight Scouts from Mount Washington Troop 1 (organized earlier that summer) attended the first National Boy Scout camp held at Silver Bay on Lake George.

The Maryland Council of Boy Scouts of America was duly incorporated on May 9, 1911. The initial board of directors was composed of Robert Garrett, William H. Morris, James Carey Jr., Frank Smith and Stuart S. Janney. The first Scout headquarters was at 512 Continental Trust Building (now One Calvert Plaza.) Almost immediately, the council was referred to as the “Baltimore Council.” From 1911 through 1921, the Baltimore Council operated as a department of the Baltimore Social Service Corporation, sharing a finance director, advisory board and other office support with the Public Athletic League, the Social Workers’ Bureau and other Garrett-supported civic endeavors.

By 1917, the Baltimore Council provided less support beyond Central Maryland as local councils were created in Frostburg, Westminster, Salisbury and Frederick.

The Frostburg Council was founded in 1917 and closed in 1919.
