<text>The Thompson submachine gun (also known as the &quot;Tommy gun&quot;, &quot;Chicago typewriter&quot;, or &quot;trench broom&quot;) is a blowback-operated, selective-fire submachine gun, invented and developed by Brigadier General John T. Thompson, a United States Army officer, in 1918. It was designed to break the stalemate of trench warfare of World War I, although early models did not arrive in time for actual combat.

The Thompson saw early use by the United States Marine Corps during the Banana Wars, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Irish Republican Army, the Republic of China, and the FBI following the Kansas City Massacre.

The weapon was also sold to the general public. Because it was so widely used by criminals, the Thompson became notorious during the Prohibition era as the signature weapon of various organized crime syndicates in the United States in the 1920s. It was a common sight in the media at the time, and was used by both law enforcement officers and criminals.

The Thompson was widely adopted by the U.S. armed forces during World War II, and was also used extensively by other Allied troops during the war. Its main models were designated as the M1928A1, M1 and M1A1 during this time. More than 1.5 million Thompson submachine guns were produced during World War II.

It is the first weapon to be labelled and marketed as a &quot;submachine gun&quot;.

The original selective-fire Thompson variants are no longer produced, although numerous semi-automatic civilian versions are still being produced by the manufacturer Auto-Ordnance. These models retain a similar appearance to the original models, but have various modifications in order to comply with US firearm laws.
==History and service==
===Development===
Brigadier General John T. Thompson, who spent most of his career in the ordnance department of the U.S. Army, was the original inventor and developer of the Thompson submachine gun. He envisioned it as being a fully automatic rifle in order to replace the bolt-action service rifles then in use (such as the American M1903 Springfield).

Thompson came across a patent issued to the American inventor John Bell Blish in 1915, while searching for a way to allow his weapon to operate safely without the complexity of a recoil or gas-operated reloading mechanism. Blish&#x27;s design (then known as the Blish lock) was based on the supposed adhesion of inclined metal surfaces under pressure. Thompson gained financial backing from the businessman Thomas F. Ryan and proceeded to found a company, which he named the Auto-Ordnance Company, in 1916, for the purpose of developing his new &quot;auto rifle&quot;.

The Thompson was primarily developed in Cleveland, Ohio. Its principal designers were Theodore H. Eickhoff, Oscar V. Payne, and George E. Goll. By late 1917, the limits of the Blish lock were discovered (which is essentially an extreme manifestation of static friction), and, rather than the firearm working as a locked breech, the weapon was instead designed to function as a friction-delayed blowback action. It was found that the only cartridge then in service suitable for use with the new lock was the .45 ACP. General Thompson envisioned a &quot;one-man, hand-held machine gun&quot; chambered in .45 ACP to be used as a &quot;trench broom&quot; for the ongoing trench warfare of World War I. Oscar V. Payne designed the new firearm along with its stick and drum magazines. The project was titled &quot;Annihilator I&quot;. Most of the design issues had been resolved by 1918; however, the war ended two days before prototypes could be shipped to Europe.

At an Auto-Ordnance board meeting in 1919, in order to discuss the marketing of the &quot;Annihilator&quot;, with the war now over the weapon was officially renamed the &quot;Thompson Submachine Gun&quot;. While other weapons had been developed shortly prior with similar objectives in mind, the Thompson was the first weapon to be labeled and marketed as a &quot;submachine gun&quot;. Thompson intended for the weapon to provide a high volume of automatic, man-portable fire for use in trench warfare—a role for which the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) had been determined ill-suited. The concept had already been developed by German troops using their own Bergmann MP 18 (the world&#x27;s first submachine gun) in concert with their tactics.

===Early use===
The first Thompson entered production as the Model of 1921. It was available to civilians, but, because of the weapon&#x27;s high price, initially saw poor sales. The Thompson (with one Type XX 20 round &quot;stick&quot; magazine) had been priced at $200 in 1921 (roughly )

The major initial complaints concerning the Thompson were its cumbersome weight, its inaccuracy at ranges over , and its lack of penetrating power using the .45 ACP cartridge.

The Thompson was first used in combat in 13 June 1921, when West Virginia state troopers fired on the mountainside near Lick Creek, where striking miners were firing at passing cars. By the time of the Battle of Blair Mountain, 37 had been acquired by the West Virginia state police and 56 were in the hands of coal companies and local law enforcement. The guns were also shipped to various hardware stores in the region.

Some of the first batches of Thompsons were bought (in America) by agents of the Irish Republic (notably the Irish politician Harry Boland). The first test of the Thompson in Ireland was performed by Irish Republican Army unit commander Tom Barry, of the West Cork Brigade, in the presence of IRA leader Michael Collins. They purchased a total of 653 units, though US customs authorities in New York seized 495 of the units in June 1921. The remainder found their way to the Irish Republican Army by way of Liverpool, England, and were used in the last month of the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921). After a truce with the British in July 1921, the Irish Republican Army imported more units, which were used in the subsequent Irish Civil War (1922–1923). The Thompson was not found to be very effective in Ireland; having only caused serious casualties in 32 percent of the action in which it was used.

During the failed 1924 Estonian coup, communists used Thompsons in an attempt to storm the Tallinn barracks; meanwhile the MP 18 was used by the defenders. This was possibly the first engagement where submachine guns were used on both sides.

The Thompson achieved early notoriety in the hands of Prohibition and Great Depression-era gangsters and the lawmen who pursued them. It was also depicted in gangster films during this era, most notably regarding the Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre. The Thompson guns used in the massacre are still being held by the Berrien County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. The Thompson has been referred to by one researcher as the &quot;gun that made the twenties roar&quot;.

Around 200 Model of 1921 Thompsons were sold in 1926 to the United States Postal Inspection Service so they could protect the mail from a spate of robberies. These weapons were loaned to the United States Marine Corps which was, at that time, tasked with guarding mail shipments; this prompted the US Navy to formally test the Thompson. The Navy requested a reduction in the rate of fire. Auto-Ordnance complied, modifying the weapons by adding a substantial amount of mass to the actuator. In 1927 a number of Thompsons would be shipped to Marines in China and Nicaragua. The Navy subsequently ordered 500 guns, designated the Model of 1928. 

The Thompson saw popularity as a point-defense weapon for countering ambushes by Nicaraguan guerrillas (in the Banana Wars) and led to the creation of four-man fire teams which had as much firepower as a nine-man rifle squad. Federal sales were then followed by sales to police departments in the US, as well as to various international armies and constabulary forces; chiefly in Central and South America.

In 1926, the Cutts compensator (a muzzle brake) was offered as an attachment option for the Thompson. Models with the compensator were cataloged as &quot;No. 21AC&quot;, at the original price of $200. The plain Thompson (without the attachment) was designated &quot;No. 21A&quot; at a reduced price of $175.

In 1928, Federal Laboratories took over distribution of the weapon from Thompson&#x27;s Auto-Ordnance Corporation. The new cost was listed as $225 per weapon (), with $5 per 50-round drum and $3 per 20-round magazine.

Thompsons had also been widely used throughout China, where several Chinese warlords and their military factions running various parts of the fragmented country made purchases of the weapon, and subsequently produced many local copies.
Nationalist China acquired a substantial number of Thompson guns for use against Japanese land forces. They began producing copies of the Thompson in small quantities for use by their armies and militias. In the 1930s, Taiyuan Arsenal (a Chinese weapons manufacturer) produced copies of the Thompson for Yan Xishan, the then warlord of Shanxi province.

The FBI had also acquired Thompsons in 1933 following the Kansas City Massacre.

A number of these guns were acquired by a construction company in Brazil, after construction of a federal road in Sergipe was disrupted by armed Cangaçeiros in December 1937 who violently opposed any attempts to build roads near their territory.

===World War II===
In 1938, the Thompson submachine gun was adopted by the U.S. military and was used during World War II.

There were two military types of Thompson submachine gun:

* The M1928A1, which had provisions for both box and drum magazines, utilized the Cutts muzzle brake, had cooling fins on the barrel, and employed a delayed blowback action with the charging handle on the top of the receiver.
* The M1 and M1A1, which had provisions for box magazines only, did not have cooling fins on the barrel, had a simplified rear sight, and employed a straight blowback action with the charging handle on the side of the receiver.

Over 1.5 million military Thompson submachine guns were produced during World War II.

====Magazine developments====

Military users of the M1928A1 units had complaints of the &quot;L&quot; 50-round drum magazine. The British Army criticized &quot;the [magazine&#x27;s] excessive weight, [and] the rattling sound they made&quot; and shipped thousands back to the U.S. in exchange for 20-round box magazines. The Thompson had to be cocked, bolt retracted, ready to fire, in order to attach the drum magazine. The drum magazine also attached and detached by sliding sideways, which made magazine changes slow and cumbersome. They also created difficulty when clearing a cartridge malfunction (&quot;jam&quot;). Reloading an empty drum with cartridges was a difficult and involved process in which the 50 rounds would be inserted and then the magazine wound up until a minimum of 9 to 11 loud &quot;clicks&quot; were heard before seating the magazine into the weapon.

In contrast, the &quot;XX&quot; twenty-round box magazine was light and compact. It tended not to rattle, and could be inserted with the bolt safely closed. The box magazine was quickly attached and detached, and was removed downward, making clearing jams easier. The box magazine tripped the bolt open lock when empty, facilitating magazine changes. An empty box was easy to reload with loose rounds. However, users complained that it was limited in capacity. In the field, some soldiers would tape two &quot;XX&quot; magazines together, in what would be known as &quot;jungle style&quot;, to quicken magazine changes.

Two alternatives to the &quot;L&quot; 50-round drum and &quot;XX&quot; 20-round box magazines were tested 6 December 1941, at Fort Knox, Kentucky. An extended thirty-round box magazine and a forty-round magazine, which were made by welding two 20-round magazines face to face, jungle style, were tested. The testers considered both superior to either the &quot;XX&quot; box or &quot;L&quot; drum. The 30-round box was approved as the new standard in December 1941 to replace the &quot;XX&quot; and &quot;L&quot; magazines. (The concept of welding two box magazines face-to-face was also carried over to the M42 submachine gun.)

====M1 development====
The staff of Savage Arms looked for ways to simplify the M1928A1, and produced a prototype in February 1942, which was tested at Aberdeen Proving Ground in March 1942. Army Ordnance approved adoption (as the M1) in April 1942. M1s were made by Savage Arms and by Auto-Ordnance. M1s were issued with the 30-round box magazine and would accept the earlier 20-round box, but would not accept the drum magazine.

====Combat use====

The Thompson was used in World War II in the hands of Allied troops as a weapon for scouts, non-commissioned officers (corporal, sergeant, and higher), and patrol leaders, as well as commissioned officers, tank crewmen, and soldiers performing raids on German positions. In the European theater, the gun was widely utilized in British and Canadian commando units, as well as in the U.S. Army paratrooper and Ranger battalions, where it was issued more frequently than in line infantry units because of its high rate of fire and its stopping power, which made it very effective in the kinds of close combat these special operations troops were expected to undertake. Military Police were fond of it, as were paratroopers, who &quot;borrowed&quot; Thompsons from members of mortar squads for use on patrols behind enemy lines. The gun was prized by those lucky enough to get one and proved itself in the close street fighting that was encountered frequently during the invasion of France. A Swedish variant of the M1928A1, the (machine pistol, model 40), served in the Swedish Army between 1940 and 1951. Through Lend-Lease, the Soviet Union also received the Thompson, but due to a shortage of appropriate ammunition, its use was not widespread.

In the Malayan Campaign, the Burma Campaign and the Pacific Theater, Lend-Lease-issue Thompsons were used by the British Army, Indian Army, Australian Army infantry and other Commonwealth forces. They used the Thompson extensively in jungle patrols and ambushes, where it was prized for its firepower, though it was criticized for its hefty weight and poor reliability. In New Guinea, the Thompson was the only submachine gun available to the Australian Army for most of the vital Kokoda Track campaign in 1942. It became so prized that soldiers routinely picked up Thompson guns dropped by killed or wounded comrades. However, the weight of the ammunition and difficulties in supply eventually led to its replacement in Australian Army units in 1943 by Australian-made submachine guns, the Owen and Austen. Thompsons were also given to the Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy.

In Burma and India, British forces largely replaced the Thompson with the Sten gun. New Zealand commando forces in the South Pacific campaign initially used Thompsons but switched them for the more reliable, lighter, and more accurate Owen during the Solomon Islands and Guadalcanal campaigns. The U.S. Marines also used the Thompson as a limited-issue weapon, especially during their later island assaults. The Thompson was soon found to have limited effect in heavy jungle cover, where the low-velocity .45 bullet would not penetrate most small-diameter trees or protective armor vests. (In 1923, the Army had rejected the .45 Remington–Thompson, which had twice the energy of the .45 ACP.) In the U.S. Army, many Pacific War jungle patrols were originally equipped with Thompsons in the early phases of the New Guinea and Guadalcanal campaigns, but soon began employing the Browning Automatic Rifle in its place as a point defense weapon.

The Army introduced the U.S. M3 and M3A1 submachine guns in 1943 with plans to produce the latter in numbers sufficient to cancel future orders for the Thompson, while gradually withdrawing it from first-line service. However, due to unforeseen production delays and requests for modifications, the M3/M3A1 never replaced the Thompson, and purchases continued until February 1944. Though the M3 was considerably cheaper to produce, at the end of World War II, the Thompson, with a total wartime production of over 1.5 million, outnumbered the M3/M3A1 submachine guns in service by nearly three to one.

===After World War II===

Thompson submachine guns were used by both sides during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Following the war, Thompsons were issued to members of Israel&#x27;s elite Unit 101, upon the formation of that unit in 1953.

During the Greek Civil War, the Thompson submachine gun was used by both sides. The Hellenic Armed Forces, gendarmerie and police units were equipped with Thompson submachine guns supplied by the British and later in the war by the United States. The opposing Communist fighters of the Democratic Army of Greece were also using Thompson submachine guns, either captured from government forces or inherited from ELAS. ELAS was the strongest of the resistance forces during the period of Greek Resistance against the Germans and Italians and were supplied with arms from both the British and the United States. After the demobilization of ELAS, an unspecified number of arms were not surrendered to the government but kept hidden and were later used by the Democratic Army of Greece.

The Thompson also found service with the KNIL and the Netherlands Marine Corps during their attempt to retake their former colony of Indonesia. The gun was used by Indonesian infiltrators during the 1965 Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation.

By the time of the Korean War in 1950, the Thompson had seen much use by the U.S. and South Korean military, even though the Thompson had been replaced as standard-issue by the M3/M3A1. With huge numbers of guns available in army ordnance arsenals, the Thompson remained classed as Limited Standard or Substitute Standard long after the standardization of the M3/M3A1. Many Thompsons were distributed to the US-backed Nationalist Chinese armed forces as military aid before the fall of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s government to Mao Zedong&#x27;s communist forces at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 (Thompsons had already been widely used throughout China since the 1920s, at a time when several Chinese warlords and their military factions running various parts of the fragmented country made purchases of the weapon and then subsequently produced many local copies). During the Korean War, US troops were surprised to encounter communist Chinese troops armed with Thompsons (amongst other captured US-made Nationalist Chinese and American firearms), especially during unexpected night-time assaults which became a prominent Chinese combat tactic in the conflict. The gun&#x27;s ability to deliver large quantities of short-range automatic assault fire proved very useful in both defense and assault during the early part of the war when it was constantly mobile and shifting back and forth. Many Chinese Thompsons were captured and placed into service with American soldiers and marines for the remaining period of the war.

The Yugoslav Army received 34,000 M1A1 Thompsons during the 1950s as part of a US Military Aid to Yugoslavia Agreement. These guns were used during the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s.

During the Cuban Revolution, the Thompson submachine gun was used by both Batista&#x27;s army and Fidel Castro&#x27;s guerrillas. Both the latter and the Brigade 2506 also used some during the Bay of Pigs Invasion.

During the Vietnam War, some South Vietnamese army units and defense militia were armed with Thompson submachine guns, and a few of these weapons were used by reconnaissance units, advisors, and other American troops. It was partially replaced by the MAC-10, albeit during Vietnam, the fully automatic fire provided by the M16 made the Thompson less effective than it previously had been. Still, not only did some U.S. soldiers have use of them in Vietnam, they encountered them as well. The Viet Cong liked the weapon and used both captured models as well as manufacturing their own copies in small jungle workshops.

The Australian government destroyed most of their Thompson machine carbines in the 1960s. They shipped their remaining stocks to arm the forces of Lon Nol&#x27;s Khmer Republic in 1975. They were then captured and used by the Khmer Rouge.

During the Troubles (1969–1998), the Thompson was again used by the Irish Republican paramilitaries. According to historian Peter Hart, &quot;The Thompson remained a key part of both the Official IRA and Provisional IRA arsenals until well into the 1970s when it was superseded by the Armalite and the AK-47.&quot;

The Thompson was also used by U.S. and overseas law enforcement and police forces, most prominently by the FBI. The FBI used Thompsons until they were declared obsolete and ordered destroyed in the early 1970s.

==Collector interest==
Because of their quality and craftsmanship, as well as their gangster-era and WWII connections, Thompsons are sought as collector&#x27;s items. There were fewer than 40 pre-production prototypes. The Colt Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company in Hartford, Connecticut was contracted by the Auto-Ordnance Corporation to manufacture the initial mass production of 15,000 Thompson Submachine Guns in 1920. An original Colt Model 1921 A or AC, Model 1927 A or AC, Model 1928 Navy A or AC, properly registered in working condition with original components can easily fetch from US$25,000 to $45,000+ depending on condition and accessories. For WWII, approximately 1,700,000 Thompson Submachine Guns were produced by Auto-Ordnance and Savage Arms, with 1,387,134 being the simplified World War II M1 and M1A1 variants (without the Blish lock and oiling system).

A Model 1921A believed to have been owned by Bonnie and Clyde, but without historical documentation to substantiate this provenance, sold at auction on 21 January 2012, in Kansas City for $130,000.

==Features==
===Operating characteristics===

Early versions of the Thompson, the Model 1919, had a fairly high cyclic rate of fire, as high as 1,200 rounds per minute (rpm), with most Model 1921s at 800 rpm. This rate of fire, combined with a rather heavy trigger pull and a stock with an excessive drop, increases the tendency for the barrel to climb off target in automatic fire. In 1927, the U.S. Navy ordered 500 Thompsons but requested a lower rate of fire. Thompson requested that Payne develop a method of reducing the cyclic rate of fire. Payne then replaced the actuator with a heavier one, and replaced the recoil spring with a stiffer one; the changes reduced the rate of fire from 800 to the 600 rpm of the U.S. Navy Model 1928. Later M1 and M1A1 Thompsons averaged also 600 rpm. Compared to more modern submachine guns, the Thompson is quite heavy, weighing roughly the same as the contemporary M1 Garand semi-automatic rifle, and requires a lot of cleaning. This was one of the major complaints about the weapon by U.S. Army personnel to whom it was issued.

Although the drum magazine provided significant firepower, in military service it was found to be overly heavy and bulky, especially when slung on the shoulder while marching. The M1928A1 Thompson drum magazine was rather fragile, and cartridges tended to rattle inside it, producing unwanted noise. For these reasons, the 20-round and later 30-round box magazines soon proved most popular with military users of the M1928A1, and drum compatibility was not included in the design of the wartime M1 and M1A1 models. The Thompson was one of the earliest submachine guns to incorporate a double-column, staggered-feed box magazine design, which undoubtedly contributed to the gun&#x27;s reputation for reliability. In addition, the gun performed better than most after exposure to rain, dirt, and mud.

The selective-fire (semi or fully automatic) Thompson fires from the &quot;open bolt&quot; position, in which the bolt is held fully to rearward by the sear when cocked. When the trigger is depressed, the bolt is released, traveling forward to chamber and simultaneously fire the first and subsequent rounds until either the trigger is released or the ammunition is exhausted. This eliminates the risk of &quot;cook-off&quot;, which can sometimes occur in closed-bolt automatic weapons.

===Disassembly===
The 1928 variant can be disassembled easily by first detaching the stock, then sliding off the lower receiver and then simply removing the internal parts, cleaning them, and then putting it back together. When opened up, the Thompson features a small number of parts that need to be removed including the spring, bolt, Blish Lock, and actuator bolt.

==Variants==
===Prototypes===
====Persuader and Annihilator====
There were two main experimental models of the Thompson. The &quot;Persuader&quot; was a belt-fed version developed in 1917/18. It was partially built, but never completely finished. The &quot;Annihilator&quot;, serial no. Ver 10 prototypes were similar in appearance to the later models, but without the rear sight and butt stock mounts. The Annihilator prototypes in which box magazine adapters were present, were first were fed from a 20-round box magazine, but later, the 50- and 100-round drum magazine models were developed.

====Model 1919====
Starting with the Serial no. 11, the Model 1919 takes the final appearance of the later Thompsons with the rear sights and butt stock. The Model 1919 was limited to about 40 units; the first built did not use the drums, as it was too difficult to fire. Many variations have been noted within this model. The weapons had very high cyclic rates up to 1,500 rpm. This was the weapon Brigadier General Thompson demonstrated at Camp Perry in 1920. A number of Model 1919s were made without butt stocks, rear and front sights, but the final version closely resembled the later Model 1921. This model was designed to &quot;sweep&quot; trenches with bullets. The New York City Police Department was the largest purchaser of the M1919. Some experimental calibers aside from the standard .45 ACP (11.4x23mm) were the .22LR, .32 ACP, .38 ACP, and 9mm.

====.351 WSL variant====
Only one prototype was made in .351 WSL using a standard 20&quot; barrel which had a ROF of 1000rpm. 1926 it was shipped to France for testing but the extractor broke after 10 rounds, no spare parts were delivered.

====Thompson .30 Carbine====

The layout and ergonomics of the Thompson submachine gun were also considered for the role of a Light Rifle before the adoption of the M1 Carbine. An example known as the &quot;Calibre .30 Short Rifle&quot; was based on the M1921/27 variants. However, it was turned down without testing due to logistical problems.

====.30-06 variant====
A .30–06 variant was intended as a rival to the M1918 BAR. It had an extended receiver with a recoil buffer and was fed from 20-round magazines.

==== M1944 Hyde Carbine ====

.30 Carbine Variant.

===Production===
====Model 1921====

The Model 1921 (M1921) was the first major production model. Fifteen thousand were produced by Colt for Auto-Ordnance. In its original design, it was finished more like a sporting weapon, with an adjustable rear sight, a blued, finned barrel and vertical foregrip (or pistol grip) and the Blish lock. The M1921 was quite expensive to manufacture, with the original retail price around $200, because of its high-quality wood furniture and finely machined parts. The M1921 was famous throughout its career with police and criminals and in motion pictures. This model gained fame from its use by criminals during Prohibition, and was nicknamed &quot;tommy gun&quot; by the media.

====Model 1923====
The Model 1923 was a heavy submachine gun introduced to potentially expand the Auto-Ordnance product line and was demonstrated for the U.S. Army. It fired the more powerful .45 Remington–Thompson cartridge which fired a heavier bullet at muzzle velocities of about and energy about , with greater range than the .45 ACP. It introduced a horizontal forearm, improved inline stock for accuracy, barrel, bipod, and bayonet lug. The M1923 was intended to rival the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), with which the Army was already satisfied. The Army did not give the Model 1923 much consideration, so it was not adopted. In addition to the .45 Remington–Thompson, the M1923 Thompsons were to be made available to prospective buyers in several calibers, including .45 ACP, 9mm Parabellum, 9mm Mauser, and .351 Winchester Self-loading.

====Model 1921AC (1926)====
While not a new model in the usual sense of incorporating major changes, in 1926 the Cutts Compensator (a muzzle brake) was offered as an option for the M1921; Thompsons with the compensator were cataloged as No. 21AC at the original price of $200.00, with the plain M1921 designated No. 21A at a reduced price of $175.00. The Model 1921 was thereafter referred to as Model 1921A or Model 1921AC, though some collectors still refer to it as the Model 1921.

====Model 1928====
The Model 1928 was the first type widely used by military forces, with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps as major buyers through the 1930s. The original Model 1928s were Model 1921s with weight added to the actuator, which slowed down the cyclic rate of fire, a United States Navy requirement. On these guns, the model number &quot;1921&quot; on the receiver was updated by stamping an &quot;8&quot; over the last &quot;1&quot;. The Navy Model 1928 has several names among collectors: the &quot;Colt Overstamp&quot;, &quot;1921 Overstamp&quot;, &quot;28 Navy&quot;, or just &quot;28N&quot;.

The 1928 Thompson would be the last small arm adopted by the U.S. Army that used a year designation in the official nomenclature. With the start of World War II, major contracts from several countries saved the manufacturer from bankruptcy. A notable variant of the Model 1928 with an aluminum receiver and tenite grip, buttstock, and forend, was made by Savage.

====M1928A1====
The M1928A1 variant entered mass production before the attack on Pearl Harbor, as on-hand stocks ran out. Changes included a horizontal forend, in place of the distinctive vertical foregrip (&quot;pistol grip&quot;), and a provision for a military sling. Despite new U.S. contracts for Lend-Lease shipments abroad to China, France, and the United Kingdom, as well as the needs of American armed forces, only two factories supplied M1928A1 Thompsons during the early years of World War II. Though it could use both the 50-round drum and the 20- or 30-round box magazines, active service favored the box magazines as the drums were more prone to jamming, rattled when moving, and were too heavy and bulky on long patrols. 562,511 were made. Wartime production variants had a fixed rear sight without the triangular sight guard wings and a non-ribbed barrel, both like those found on the M1/M1A1.

In addition, the Soviet Union received M1928A1s, included as standard equipment with the M3 light tanks obtained through Lend-Lease. These submachine guns were used to a limited extent by the Red Army.

Some M1928A1 Thompsons were used by the French before and during the Battle of France (1940) under the designation &quot;Pistolet-mitrailleur 11 mm 43 (C.45) M. 28 A1.&quot;

An M1928A1 with an unusual inline stock, modified with elevated sights to increase accuracy, also was produced. Some Thompsons were built with a folding stock, similar to M1A1 Carbines used by Allied tank crews, drivers and paratroopers and submarine raiders.

===Service variants===
====Thompson Machine Carbine (TMC)====
In 1940, Commonwealth troops in Egypt and North Africa were issued commercial model Lend-Lease Colt- and Savage-manufactured M1928s. Section leaders carried them instead of pistols or rifles. Many of the Colt models had French-language manuals packed with them as they had been abruptly diverted to England after the fall of France. They soon discovered that the weapon was prone to jamming due to sand. To fix this, the armorers removed the Blish Lock and replaced it with a hex bolt to keep the cocking handle and bolt together. The 20-round Type XX magazines had their peep-holes welded shut to keep sand out and the 50-round Type L drums were discontinued. Ammunition was scarce as it was either in small lots of Lend-Lease commercial ammo or obtained from adjacent American troops. It was later replaced by the 9mm Sten gun and Lanchester SMG.

Models used in the Pacific by Australian troops had their sling swivels remounted on the left side to allow it to be fired more easily while prone. A metal sling mount was fitted to the left side of the wooden buttstock. Ammunition was manufactured in Australia or obtained from adjacent American troops. It was later replaced by the Owen Machine Carbine.

Responding to a request for further simplification, the M1 was standardized in April 1942 as the United States Submachine Gun, Cal. .45, M1. Rate of fire was reduced to approximately 600–700 rpm.

First issued in 1943, the M1 uses a simple blowback operation, with the charging handle moved to the side. The flip-up adjustable Lyman rear sight was replaced with a fixed L sight. Late M1s had triangular guard wings added to the rear L sight, which were standardized on the M1A1. The slots adjoining the magazine well allowing the use of a drum magazine were removed. A new magazine catch with the provision for retaining drum magazines removed, was produced, but most M1s and later M1A1s retained the original. The less expensive and more-easily manufactured &quot;stick&quot; magazines were used exclusively in the M1, with a new 30-round version joining the familiar 20-round type. The Cutts compensator, barrel cooling fins, and Blish lock were omitted while the buttstock was permanently affixed. Late production M1 stocks were fitted with reinforcing bolts and washers to prevent splitting of the stock where it attached to the receiver. The British had used improvised bolts or wood screws to reinforce M1928 stocks. The M1 reinforcing bolt and washer were carried over to the M1A1 and retrofitted to many of the M1928A1s in American and British service. Late M1s also had simplified fire control switches, also carried over to the M1A1. Certain M1s had issues with high rate of fire climbing up to ~800 RPM. The exact cause remains unknown, but was resolved with the transition to the M1A1.

====M1A1==== 
The M1A1, standardized in October 1942 as the United States Submachine Gun, Cal. .45, M1A1, could be produced in half the time of the M1928A1, and at a much lower cost. The main difference between the M1 and M1A1 was the bolt. The M1 bolt had a floating firing pin and hammer, and the bolt of the M1A1 had the firing pin machined to the face of the bolt, eliminating unnecessary parts. The reinforced stock and protective sight wings were standard. The 30-round magazine became more common. In 1939, Thompsons&#x27; cost the government $209 apiece. By the spring of 1942, cost-reduction design changes had brought this down to $70. In February 1944, the M1A1 reached a low price of $45 each, including accessories and spare parts, although the difference in price between the M1 and M1A1 was only $0.06. By the end of the war, the M1A1 was replaced with the even lower-cost M3 (commonly called the &quot;Grease Gun&quot;).

===Semi-automatic===
====Model 1927====
The Model 1927 was the open bolt semi-automatic version of the M1921. It was made by modifying an existing Model 1921, including replacing certain parts. The &quot;Thompson Submachine Gun&quot; inscription was machined over to replace it with &quot;Thompson Semi-Automatic Carbine&quot;, and the &quot;Model 1921&quot; inscription was also machined over to replace it with &quot;Model 1927.&quot; Although the Model 1927 was semi-automatic only, it was easily converted to fully automatic by installing a full-auto Model 1921 fire control group (internal parts). Most Model 1927s owned by police have been converted back to full-auto. The original Model 1927 is classified as a machine gun under the National Firearms Act of 1934 (a) by being &quot;readily convertible&quot; by swapping parts and (b) by a 1982 BATF ruling making all open bolt semi-automatic firearms manufactured after the date of this ruling classified as machine guns.

====Model 1927A1====
The Model 1927A1 is a semi-automatic replica version of the Thompson, originally produced by Auto-Ordnance of West Hurley, New York for the civilian collector&#x27;s market from 1974 to 1999. It has been produced since 1999 by Kahr Arms of Worcester, Massachusetts. It is officially known as the &quot;Thompson Semi-Automatic Carbine, Model of 1927A1.&quot; The internal design is completely different to operate from the closed bolt and the carbine has a barrel length of (versus open bolt operation and barrel length of for the fully automatic versions). Under federal regulations, these changes make the Model 1927A1 legally a rifle and remove it from the federal registry requirements of the National Firearms Act. These modern versions should not be confused with the original semi-automatic M1927, which was a slightly modified M1921 produced by Colt for Auto-Ordnance.

The Model 1927A1 is the semi-automatic replica of the Thompson Models of 1921 and 1927. The &quot;Thompson Commando&quot; is a semi-automatic replica of the M1928A1. The Auto-Ordnance replica of the Thompson M1 and M1A1 is known as the TM1 and may be found marked &quot;Thompson Semi-Automatic Carbine, Caliber .45M1&quot;.

====Model 1927A3====
The Model 1927A3 is a semi-automatic, .22 caliber version of the Thompson produced by Auto-Ordnance in West Hurley.

====Model 1927A5====
The Model 1927A5 is a semi-automatic, .45 ACP pistol version of the Thompson originally produced by Auto-Ordnance in West Hurley from the 1970s until the late 1980s or early 1990s. It featured an aluminum receiver to reduce weight. It has since been replaced with the Kahr Arms TA5 Pistol, which features a 10.5&quot; barrel and steel receiver, unlike the 1927A5&#x27;s 13&quot; barrel and aluminum receiver.

As per the NFA (National Firearms Act of 1934), the &quot;1927A5 .45 ACP Pistol&quot; is simply classified as a &quot;Firearm&quot; (Any type of firearm with an overall length of 26&quot; or greater, that does not have a buttstock) as it neither fits the definition of a Pistol or Rifle under federal law. This categorization also legally allows it to have 1921 or 1928 style foregrip equipped, unlike other &quot;pistol style&quot; Thompson variants, without an AOW (Any Other Weapon) Tax Stamp.

====1928A1 LTD====
The 1928A1 LTD is a civilian semi-automatic conversion by Luxembourg Defense Technology (LuxDefTec) in Luxembourg. They are made from original 1928A1 guns of various appearance (with or without Cutt&#x27;s compensator, ribbed or smooth barrels, adjustable or fixed sights), that were imported Lend-Lease guns from Russia.

===Export variants===
====BSA Thompsons====
In an attempt to expand interest and sales overseas, Auto-Ordnance entered into a partnership with and licensed the Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited (BSA) in England to produce a European model. These were produced in small quantities and have a different appearance than the classic style. The BSA 1926 was manufactured in 9mmP and 7.63mm Mauser and were tested by various governments, including France, in the mid-1920s. It was never adopted by any military force, and only a small number were produced.

===RPB Thompsons===
====Special purpose variant====
A special purpose machine pistol variant of the Thompson is manufactured by RPB Industries of Atlanta.

====Suppressed variant====
A version with a threaded barrel for suppressors, side folding stock, and modified sights.

===Thompson clones===
Similar weapons were manufactured by Apache Arms, Eagle Gun Co., Volunteer Enterprises Inc, and Spitfire MFG Co.

==Civilian ownership==
===Canada===
All variants and modified versions of Thompson submachine guns (even semiautomatic-only versions) are prohibited by name in Canada, as part of Prohibited Weapons Order No. 13 in 1995. Consequently, they cannot be legally imported or owned except under very limited circumstances. For example, to own one the person must be &quot;grandfathered&quot; (have owned one before the bill was passed against it), and have a valid prohibited-class firearms licence. Additionally, it would need to be already registered with the Canadian Firearms Registry. The submachine gun itself is not grandfathered like in the U.S., only the owner with the valid prohibited-class firearms licence is. The submachine gun can only be sold to other grandfathered individuals with a prohibited-class (12.2) licence, or to a business, museum or organization with a firearms business licence for prohibited-class firearms. This keeps prices extremely low as the number of permitted licensed individuals is very small and dwindling with time. Eventually, all prohibited-class firearms will be out of circulation with the grandfathered individual licence holders. However, they will still be able to be owned by licensed businesses and museums.

===United States===

The perceived popularity of submachine guns such as the Thompson with violent gangsters in the 1920s and 1930s was one of the main reasons given for passage of the National Firearms Act by the United States Congress in 1934. One of its provisions was that owners of fully automatic firearms were required to register them with the predecessor agency of the modern Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The law also placed restrictions on the possession, transfer, and transport of the weapons.

There are several U.S.-made automatic and semi-automatic variants, copies, or replicas. The semi-automatic versions are less regulated by federal law.

===United Kingdom===
The possession of any fully automatic firearm is prohibited in the UK by the Firearms Act 1968; prohibited firearms can be possessed under Section 5 authority from the Home Office, but these are not issued for sporting purposes. A fully automatic firearm that has been converted to semi-automatic fire, such as the Model 1927, is prohibited by the Firearms Act 1988, as is any centre-fire purpose-made semi-automatic weapon, such as the Model 1927A1. It is now effectively impossible for a firearm of this type to be legally possessed by a member of the general public, except in certified deactivated condition or where specifically manufactured as a semi-automatic in caliber .22LR.

===Germany===
The gun, in a government-approved semiautomatic conversion or clone, can legally be owned by hunters and sport shooters. With a design date prior to 1942 it is not considered a &quot;weapon of war.&quot; Only the fully automatic version is a prohibited weapon. As a long gun, it can be bought by hunters (even if it cannot be used to actually hunt for legal reasons). There are disciplines in government-approved sport shooting rulebooks that allow this type to be used, therefore the gun can be bought by sport shooters, too.

<text>In Aboriginal mythology, Erathipa is a boulder that has the shape of a pregnant woman; contained within Erathipa are the souls of dead children which can inhabit the bodies of fertile young women. The fertility stone has an opening on one side.
The tribes of central Australia have... a huge rock known as Erathipa, which has an opening in one side from which the souls of the children imprisoned in it watch for a woman to pass by so that they may be reborn in her. When women who do not want children go near the rock, they pretend to be old, and walk as if leaning on a stick, crying; &quot;Don&#x27;t come to me, I am an old woman!&quot;
The idea implicit in all these rites, is that certain stones have the power to make sterile women fruitful, either because of the spirits of the ancestors that dwell in them, or because of their shape (the pregnant woman, &quot;woman stone&quot;), or because of their origin (&quot;autogenesis&quot;).

<text>Vector was an American rock band formed in Sacramento, California, in the early 1980s by Jimmy Abegg and Steve Griffith. The band had several drummers over the years, including Aaron Smith and Bruce Spencer, both of whom also played drums for the 77s.

Although the lyrics of Vector&#x27;s music did not always contain the overt lyrics of contemporary Christian music with which the band was sometimes associated, Vector&#x27;s albums were released under Christian labels, and were an example of Christian rock.

After a lengthy hiatus, Vector released a new album, &quot;Vital&quot;, in August 2021.

<text>Wayne County is the most populous county in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of 2020, the United States census placed its population at 1,793,561, making it the 19th-most populous county in the United States. The county seat is Detroit. The county was founded in 1796 and organized in 1815. Wayne County is included in the Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, MI Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is one of several U.S. counties named after Revolutionary War-era general Anthony Wayne.

==History==

Wayne County was the sixth county in the Northwest Territory, formed August 15, 1796, from portions of territorial Hamilton County, territorial Knox County and unorganized territory. It was named for the U.S. general &quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne. It originally encompassed the entire area of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, most of the Upper Peninsula, as well as smaller sections that are now part of northern Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin. By proclamation of the Territorial Secretary and Acting Governor, Winthrop Sargent, on August 15, 1796, the boundaries of Wayne County were declared to begin at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River then west to Fort Wayne, then to the southernmost point of Lake Michigan and along the western shore north to the territorial boundary in Lake Superior and then along the territorial boundary through Lake Huron, Lake St. Clair, and Lake Erie back to the starting point. The first division of the county into townships occurred November 1, 1798, into the four townships of Detroit, Hamtramck, Mackinaw, and Sargent. The extent of Wayne county at that time included all the present state of Michigan in addition to parts of Indiana, Ohio, and Wisconsin, so that the townships erected at that time were vastly larger than the corresponding divisions of the present time.

On January 14, 1803, the Governor of Indiana Territory, William Henry Harrison, issued a similar proclamation defining the boundaries as beginning at a point where an east and west line passing through the southernmost extreme of Lake Michigan would intersect a north and south line, passing through the westernmost extreme of the lake, then north to the territorial boundary, then along said boundary line to a point where an east and west line passing through the southerly extreme of Lake Michigan would intersect the same, then along this last mentioned line to the place of beginning. This boundary would include Chicago, Illinois, and a sizable strip of Wisconsin along Lake Michigan.

These boundaries would be adjusted as Indiana and Illinois became states and as other counties were formed within Michigan Territory.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (9.0%) is water. Its water area includes parts of the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair.

Wayne County borders on Oakland County and Macomb County to the north, Washtenaw County to the west, Essex County, Ontario, Canada to the east, and Monroe County to the south.

The eastern (and sometimes southern) boundary is a water boundary in the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair with Essex County, Ontario. Automotive traffic crosses this boundary at the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel and the Ambassador Bridge. Due to the southwestern course of the river, this small portion of Canada actually lies to the south of Wayne County. The southern communities of the county are usually referred to as &quot;Downriver&quot;, in reference to their location downstream of downtown Detroit.

Grosse Ile is the largest island in the county and is connected to the mainland by the Wayne County Bridge and the Grosse Ile Toll Bridge. The highest elevation () in the county is near Northville, in Maybury State Park.

===Adjacent counties===
* Washtenaw County (west)
* Monroe County (south/southwest)
* Essex County, Ontario, Canada (east/southeast)
* Lambton County, Ontario, Canada (east/northeast across Lake St. Clair)
* Macomb County (north/northeast)
* Oakland County (north)

===Wayne County Department of Public Services===
The Wayne County Department of Public Services was formed in 1906 as the Wayne County Road Commission. It was the government agency in Wayne County, Michigan responsible for building and maintaining the county&#x27;s roads and highways.

Its first commissioners were Edward N. Hines, Cassius R. Benton, and automobile manufacturer Henry Ford. While the commission was authorized by an 80% positive vote of county voters in a 1906 referendum, it was controversial and there was a Michigan state supreme court case pressed which found it unconstitutional. Commissioners Benton and Ford quit, but commissioner Hines persisted and led the commission through reorganization getting around the obstacles. Hines was a commissioner continuously from 1906 to 1938. Hines is credited with the idea of putting a painted line down a roadway&#x27;s center to divide traffic, and other innovations that were later widely adopted.

The commission claims credit for constructing the country&#x27;s first mile of concrete-paved rural highway, a section of Woodward Avenue just outside the Detroit city limits.

A number of the county road commissions&#x27; works are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The county road commission was merged into the general county government, becoming the Roads Division of the Department of Public Services.

===Transit===
* Detroit station is located in the New Center neighborhood and serves the Amtrak Wolverine intercity trains.
* The Detroit Bus Station is located in the Corktown neighborhood and serves intercity buses to destinations across the Midwest.
* The Detroit Department of Transportation and Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation provide local and regional bus service.
* The QLine operates streetcar service down Woodward Avenue.

===Major highways===
* through the Downriver communities, then through the southwest-side neighborhoods of Detroit and serves as the northern border of Downtown Detroit as the Fisher Freeway. It then turns away from the Fisher onto the Chrysler Freeway at a complex interchange with I-375 and an unnumbered extension which connects with M-3, then follows M-1, which is less than a mile away through the remainder of Detroit, connecting eastern Wayne County to Toledo and Flint to the south and north respectively. It runs non-stop to the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge to the north and to Florida to the south.
* runs east–west through the central parts of Wayne County, connecting it to Port Huron eastbound and Chicago westbound. To the west it provides an uninterrupted route as far as Montana and connects to the northern side of the Detroit Metro Airport. In Detroit it is known as the Edsel Ford Freeway.
* has its eastern terminus in the county, in Detroit. It follows Grand River Avenue until the city&#x27;s northwest side, there it turns due west to I-275, where it turns north to concurrent with I-275. West of Detroit to I-275 it is known as the Jeffries Freeway; in Detroit it is the Rosa Parks Memorial Highway, but it is sometimes still known as the Jeffries.
* , most of whose mileage is in Wayne County, serves the southern side of the Detroit Metro Airport.
* is the nation&#x27;s shortest Interstate Highway to be &quot;signed&quot;. However some highways are shorter but are not signed at all. It serves as the eastern boundary of Downtown Detroit and is a southern extension of the Chrysler Freeway. There are currently plans in the works to turn I-375 into a 6-lane boulevard. Construction will start in 2025 and is expected to finish by 2028.
* has its eastern terminus in Downtown Detroit at Cass Avenue. From there it travels through the west side of Detroit and through Dearborn and other points west and is a useful alternative to I-94. US 12 continues west through Michigan, passing through several US cities including Chicago and Minneapolis, eventually ending in the Pacific Northwest in Aberdeen, Washington. Locally it is known as Michigan Avenue.
* traverses through Downriver and the far west sides of Dearborn and Detroit and is a useful alternative to I-75. Locally it is known as Telegraph Road.

* entered Wayne County on Grand River Avenue and ended in Downtown Detroit.
* was the designated name for Dix-Toledo Highway in Downriver and Fort Street and Gratiot Avenue in Detroit. The construction of I-75 resulted in the truncation of U.S. Route 25 to Cincinnati.
* followed Michigan Avenue out of Downtown Detroit and out of Wayne County. Is now a routing of U.S. Route 12.
* has its southern terminus in Downtown Detroit at Adams Street. It travels through Midtown Detroit and New Center and through Highland Park. It serves as an alternative to I-75 and M-10. Locally known as Woodward Avenue. M-1 was a result of US-10 being redesignated to the Lodge Freeway.
* has its southern terminus in Downtown Detroit at Randolph and Jefferson Avenue. It proceeds northeasterly through Detroit&#x27;s northeast side and beyond towards Mount Clemens and points further north. Locally known as Gratiot Avenue. M-3 was the result of the removal of US-25 from Michigan.
* begins at the northern intersection with I-96 on Detroit&#x27;s northwest side and follows Grand River Avenue out of the county.
* runs from I-96 to Conant Street in Detroit, passing through Highland Park. The freeway portion is known as the Davison Freeway.
* starts at the same intersection where M-3 starts in Downtown Detroit and travels further into the city on the Lodge Freeway and connects it to Southfield.
* starts at the interchange with I-96 and I-275 in Livonia and travels out into rural areas, serving Plymouth and Ann Arbor.
* starts in Lincoln Park&#x27;s city center and runs along Southfield Road to Allen Park and becomes the Southfield Freeway, traveling through the west side of Detroit.
* begins at M-3 in Detroit, running through the city and connecting it to the Thumb area of the state. Locally known as Van Dyke Avenue.
* , which is entirely in Wayne County, starts at Griswold Street in Downtown Detroit and connects the city&#x27;s southwest side to Downriver, ending near Flat Rock at I-75, for whom which M-85 serves as an alternative. Locally known as West Fort and South Fort, divided at the River Rouge.
* only runs a short distance through Detroit&#x27;s northeast side, starting at M-3. In the city it follows Gunston Street and Hoover Street.
* follows the county line between M-5 and I-94. Locally known as West 8 Mile and East 8 Mile, divided at John R. Street.
* starts at Wyoming Street on the Detroit-Dearborn limit and continues through the western suburbs as Ford Road.
* became part of US 16, which is also removed from Michigan.
* once followed Ecorse Road into Lincoln Park, then ran concurrently with U.S. Route 25 to Downtown Detroit.
* connected US 24 in Monroe to Flat Rock; it once connected to US 112 in Canton along Huron River Drive and Belleville Road.
* entered Wayne County during World War II, and the years following, on an expressway, providing access to the Willow Run Airport in Van Buren Township and turned onto present-day Interstate 94 in Romulus Township. In Taylor Township it had interchanges with both M-17 and US 24, then ended at US 112 in Dearborn.
* Dixie Highway ran through Wayne County as early as 1915. Back then it was one of the only routes that connected the county to the Southern United States. Today there are no traces of the old highway in the county.

===Airports===
* Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport is located in the Downriver community of Romulus. It serves as a hub for Delta Air Lines and Spirit Airlines and is one of the two airports operated by the Wayne County Airport Authority.
* Willow Run Airport is located in Van Buren Township and has four runways (a fifth was recently converted into a taxiway). No scheduled flights operate out of Willow Run and is one of the two airports operated by the Wayne County Airport Authority.
* Grosse Ile Municipal Airport is located about south of Grosse Ile Township&#x27;s downtown area. It has two paved runways. No scheduled flights operate out of this airport as well.
* Coleman A. Young International Airport is also known as the Detroit City Airport, which is not to be confused with the larger and nearby Detroit Metro Airport. It is located just a short drive from Downtown Detroit along M-3. It also has two runways and no scheduled flights, although it has been attempted in the past.

==Government==
Wayne County is Michigan&#x27;s first &quot;charter county&quot;, with a home rule charter setting up its structures within limits set in state law and constitution. Most Michigan county governments are structured according to state law, without a locally adopted charter. The county is governed pursuant to the &quot;Home Rule Charter of Wayne County, Michigan&quot;, and the &quot;Wayne County Code&quot; is the codification of Wayne County&#x27;s local ordinances. Unless a violation of the code or other ordinance is specifically designated as a municipal civil infraction (or unless expressly otherwise required by applicable state or federal laws), the violation is a misdemeanor.

The county government operates the jail, maintains rural roads, keeps files of deeds and mortgages, maintains vital records for all areas except Detroit, administers public health regulations, and participates with the state in the provision of welfare and other social services. Most other local government functions – police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance, etc. – are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.

===Department of Public Services===
Formerly the Wayne County Road Commission, the Department of Public Services is the government agency in Wayne County responsible for building and maintaining the county&#x27;s roads and highways. A number of the former agency&#x27;s works are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Corrections===
The Wayne County Jail Division operates The Andrew C. Baird Detention Facility in Downtown Detroit, The Old Wayne County Jail in Downtown Detroit, and The William Dickerson Detention Facility in Hamtramck.

==Politics==
Wayne County has backed the Democratic candidate for president in every election from 1932 onward, at times by large margins. From 1896 to 1928, it had always voted Republican for president, or at least more Republican than Democratic. Its large population has helped swing the election to Democrats in many statewide elections since then, with candidates running up large margins here offsetting Republican majorities in most rural counties of Michigan. In fact, between 1944 and 2012, the county had the largest margin of victory for the Democratic candidate in Michigan in every presidential election except for 1976 and 1984, both times coming in second place to Gogebic County in the Upper Peninsula by less than 1.5%.

More recently, however, the margin of victory for the Democrats has started to shrink. Beginning in 2016, neighboring Washtenaw County, home of the University of Michigan, has surpassed Wayne County as the most Democratic county in Michigan; and in 2024, Ingham County, home of Michigan State University, also voted more Democratic than Wayne County. In 2020, Donald Trump became the first Republican since 1988 to crack 30% of the vote in the county. The 2024 election saw an even bigger shift, with Trump taking more than one-third of the county&#x27;s vote, and Kamala Harris turning in the worst performance for a Democrat in Wayne County in 36 years, winning by less than 30% for the first time since 1988.

The last Republican candidate to carry Wayne County in a statewide election was Candice Miller when she won re-election to the Secretary of State office in 1998.

<text>Washtenaw County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of Michigan. At the 2020 census, the population was 372,258. The county seat and largest city is Ann Arbor. The county was authorized by legislation in 1822 and organized as a county in 1826.
Washtenaw County comprises the Ann Arbor [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]].
The county is home to the University of Michigan, Eastern Michigan University, Washtenaw Community College, and Concordia University Ann Arbor.

==History==
===Native American territories===
The first peoples occupying the central portion of what is now Michigan included: &quot;the Pottawattamies, the Chippewas, the Ottawas, the Wyandottes and the Hurons&quot;. Native Americans whose territories included land within the Washtenaw County boundaries are shown to have included: Myaamia (Miami), Bodéwadmiké (Potawatomi), Anishinabewaki ᐊᓂᔑᓈᐯᐗᑭ, Peoria, Meškwahki·aša·hina (Meskwaki), and the Mississauga nation.

===Etymology of Washtenaw===
In the Ojibwe language, &quot;Wash-ten-ong&quot; or &quot;Owashtanong&quot; literally translates as &quot;far away waters&quot;, and was then used by the Ojibwe as the name for the Grand River due to its great length.
At the time of the official naming of the county in 1822, the headwaters of the Grand River fell within the original boundaries of Washtenaw County, which encompassed a much larger area than the present county.

===Early colonization===
The earliest histories mention French trappers and traders conducting trade in the area at the Potawatomi Trail and Pontiac Trail crossings of the Huron River, and later English then American settlers. The first successful settlement was established at the present site of Ypsilanti about 1809 by French traders.

In 1822, the Legislative Council of Michigan Territory government defined the name and boundaries of the county, but attached it to Wayne County for revenue, taxation and judicial affairs. Four years after the first platting out of the county, Washtenaw was established as a separate self-administered county by an act of the Michigan Territorial Legislature, in 1826. It was attached for administrative purposes to Wayne County until (before 1829) when county government was seated. Ingham and other counties were formed from portions of territorial Washtenaw County.

Swamps were drained to lower the water table. The swamp northwest of the I-94 and US-23 intersection, and areas within Waterloo Recreation Area still appear as they did to early settlers. As productive farms became established, the local deer herds grew. In the 1820s and 1830s, the events surrounding the independence of Greece from Turkey inspired construction of Greek Revival buildings, and the names of townships, towns, and children.

The &quot;frostbitten convention&quot; was held at Ann Arbor, the county seat, in 1835. Statehood was delayed because Michigan claimed the Toledo Strip, which was also claimed by Ohio. Following resolution of the Toledo War (1835–1836), in which Michigan Territory ceded its claim to Toledo in exchange for most of the Upper Peninsula (from the Porcupine Mountains eastward), Ohio withdrew its objection and Michigan became a state on January 26, 1837.

The convention also decided to move the capital from Detroit to a point further away from the Canadian border. After considering many existing communities, the delegates decided to build an entirely new capital city, which became Lansing. The University of Michigan, founded at Detroit in 1817, was moved to Ann Arbor in 1839 as a consolation for the city not being named the new state capital, as it had sought. The university subsequently became and remains Washtenaw County&#x27;s largest employer.

In 1849, the Michigan State Normal School (now Eastern Michigan University) was established in Washtenaw&#x27;s oldest settlement, Ypsilanti. It was elevated to collegiate status c. 1891 as Michigan State Normal College. The name was changed in 1956 to Eastern Michigan College, which was elevated to university status in 1959.

===Government services===
====Parks and recreation====

Washtenaw County operates 10 parks and one recreation center (gymnasium). One park has a water sprinkler area, one has a substantial water park component, and there is one golf course. The recreation center has a swimming pool, indoor track, basketball courts, complete set of resistance machines, a weight room, and several multipurpose rooms.

Washtenaw County is in the process of acquiring land for natural preservation. The program started in 2001, was renewed in 2010. The millage was renewed a second time in 2020 with a record high of 72% of votes supporting the renewal. Eight parcels of land had been purchased by July 2007. These parcels are of special ecological, recreational, and educational benefits. They are preserved in a natural unimproved state and are open to the public during daylight hours.

====Wireless communication====
In partnership with private enterprise, the county maintains a wireless network which is currently available to approximately 50% of county residents. This is the Wireless Washtenaw Project; its stated aim of this project is to provide wireless access to all county residents.

====Miscellaneous====
The county government operates the jail, maintains rural roads (through a largely independent road commission), operates the major local courts, records deeds and mortgages, maintains vital records, administers public health regulations, and participates with the state in providing welfare and social services. The county board of commissioners controls the budget and has limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local government functions – police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance, etc. – are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.

==Politics==













Since 1988, when Michael Dukakis won it, the county has been a Democratic stronghold in local and national elections due to the presence of Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan. In the 2020 United States presidential election it gave 72.4% of the vote to Democratic nominee Joe Biden, the highest margin for a Democrat in the county, the third-highest for any candidate in the county&#x27;s history, and the highest in the state at the time as well. Between 1960 and 1988 it was generally a swing county: 1992 marked the first time that the county supported the same party as in the previous election since 1960. 

Despite its modern-day Democratic strength, it was reliably Republican at the presidential level from 1896 to 1960, only voting Democratic once in that span in 1912 when the Republican vote was split. It was one of the few counties where Franklin D. Roosevelt was shut out in all four of his successful campaigns. George McGovern&#x27;s win over Richard Nixon in the county in 1972 despite the latter winning nationally by a landslide was a sign of the county&#x27;s shift towards supporting the Democratic Party, though Michigander and former Wolverine Gerald R. Ford won it in 1976 and Ronald Reagan won it in 1984 amid his national landslide, being the most recent Republican to win the county.

<text>Van Buren County is a county located in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 75,587. The county seat is Paw Paw. The county was founded in 1829 and organized in 1837.

==History==
The county was named for Martin Van Buren before he became president. He was U.S. Secretary of State and later Vice President under President Andrew Jackson; thus Van Buren is one of Michigan&#x27;s &quot;Cabinet counties&quot;.

The Van Buren County Courthouse was built by Claire Allen, a prominent Southern Michigan architect; its cornerstone was laid on September 2, 1901, after a July vote to issue $35,000 in county bonds.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (44%) is water.

Much of the county is farmland dotted with small towns. Areas near Kalamazoo County, specifically Antwerp Township and Almena Township, are becoming suburbanized. Many of the inland lakes are ringed with homes, either by people living year-round or cottagers, generally people who live the rest of the time in Chicago. As with other areas near Lake Michigan, tourism is a major industry.

==Government==
Van Buren County has usually voted Republican in national elections. Since 1884, the county&#x27;s voters have selected the Republican Party nominee in 81% (29 of 36) of the national elections through 2024. However, the county has become a swing county as well as a bellwether in recent decades, voting for the overall winner in every presidential election from 1964 to 2024 with two exceptions: 1976, when the county backed native Michigander Gerald Ford who narrowly lost his bid for a full term, and 2020, when Van Buren County stayed with Donald Trump, a popular candidate in this county and other rural bellwethers.













Van Buren County operates the County jail, maintains rural roads, operates the major local courts, records deeds, mortgages, and vital records, administers public health regulations, and participates with the state in the provision of social services. The county board of commissioners controls the budget and has limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local government functions – police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance etc. – are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.

<text>Tuscola County ( ) is a county in the Thumb region of the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the population was 53,323. The county seat is Caro. The county was created by Michigan Law on April 1, 1840, from land in Sanilac County and attached to Saginaw County for administrative purposes. The Michigan Legislature passed an act on March 2, 1850, that empowered the county residents to organize governmental functions. Tuscola County is one of five counties in the Thumb area. Like the rest of the Thumb, Tuscola County enjoys seasonal tourism from cities like Flint, Detroit and Saginaw.

==History==

The name Tuscola was a neologism created by Henry Schoolcraft and had an aboriginal root. That source likely was the native Ojibwe name &quot;desakamigaa&quot; that means the flat level ground or simply the flat country. For an ending, Mr. Schoolcraft then used a form of the Latin word &quot;colo&quot; that means to cultivate, till, or farm or a land that is cultivated. For the suffix, the related Latin word &quot;colonia&quot; from which we get today the word colony means a farm estate. Tuscola then means the flat cultivated land. Henry Schoolcraft once wrote that Tuscola was derived from Native words and meant level lands. A similar word to desakamigaa is the Ojibwe word &quot;desinaagan&quot; that is translated as dinner plate. Shell in their language is &quot;ess&quot;. The Ojibwe often used a shell or bark from a tree for a dish. The Ojibwe prefixes &quot;desi-&quot; and &quot;tessa&quot; are used to form their words for flat objects such as a shelf, platform, bench, or plate.

The Thumb of Michigan, which also includes Huron and Sanilac Counties, was originally called by Iroquois speaking people &quot;Skenchioe&quot; in the 17th century, which may be related to the Onondaga word &quot;uschwuntschios&quot; meaning a champaign or large extended plain. In the early 18th century, the French called the Thumb of Michigan &quot;Le Pays Plat&quot; that means The Flat Country. The French word &quot;pays&quot; means country while &quot;plat&quot; means flat. The English in the later 18th Century also called the land back from the shoreline around the Thumb of Michigan the Flat Country. The Thumb of Michigan forms a tableland with knolls or hillocks located in the central part of the Thumb along the Cass River. The county seat of Tuscola is Caro that is located north of the Cass River along one of these large knolls. The land around Caro particularly to the west, north, and northeast is widely farmed and cultivated. The township in which Caro lies was named Indianfields because it was a place of many early Native American gardens.

At the Treaty of Saginaw of 1819, the native leader who represented the Cass River and the Tuscola area was Chief Otusson. Otusson&#x27;s Reservation was located where today lies Frankenmuth, MI. Otusson&#x27;s Reservation along with a large amount of the surrounding land was sold by the Treaty of 1837.

==Government==
Tuscola County has been strongly Republican for most of its history, only failing to back a Republican candidate four times in presidential elections from 1884 to the present day, and in only one of those elections did the Democratic nominee win a majority of the county&#x27;s vote.













The county government operates the jail, maintains rural roads, operates the
major local courts, keeps files of deeds and mortgages, maintains vital records, administers
public health regulations, and participates with the state in the provision of welfare and
other social services. The county board of commissioners controls the
budget but has only limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local
government functions — police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street
maintenance, etc. — are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.

French colonists in the late 17th century were the first Europeans to explore this territory, and they named the St. Joseph River for the patron saint of New France. This area was not part of the United States until after the American Revolutionary War. After the 1821 Treaty of Chicago was signed, regional tribes of the indigenous peoples ceded much land to the United States, opening the area for American settlement. The county was set off and organized by the Michigan Territory legislature in 1829; it was named for the river.

The area is home to the oldest and largest Amish community in Michigan.

St. Joseph County comprises the Sturgis, MI Micropolitan Statistical Area and is included in the Kalamazoo-Battle Creek-Portage, MI Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
This area was settled by members of the three Algonquian-speaking tribes of the Council of Three Fires: the Potawatomi, Odawa, and Chippewa (known as Ojibwa in Canada). French explorers in a party led by Father Hennepin came upriver from Lake Michigan in 1679. A Jesuit mission was established near where the French later built Fort St. Joseph, and they named the waterway as the St. Joseph River.

==Geography==

<doc id="95035" wikidata="Q115273" url="?curid=95035" title="St. Clair County, Michigan">
<text>St. Clair County is a county located in the U.S. state of Michigan and bordering the west bank of the St. Clair River. As of the 2020 census, the population was 160,383. It is the 13th-most populous county in the state. The county seat is Port Huron, located at the north end of the St. Clair River at Lake Huron. The county was created September 10, 1820, and its government was organized in 1821. It is located northeast of Detroit. It is considered by the State of Michigan to be a part of The Thumb, a peninsula that is surrounded by Lake Huron in the east-central area of the state. This area is sometimes dubbed the Blue Water Area.

==Etymology==
French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle led an expedition to this area on August 12, 1679. They named the lake as &quot;&quot;, because it was the feast day of Saint Clare of Assisi, whom they venerated. English mapmakers adopted the French name, identifying the lake feature as Saint Clare on maps dated as early as 1710. By the Mitchell Map of 1755, the spelling was given as St. Clair, which later became the current version in 1924. Located along the western shores of Lake St. Clair and the St. Clair River, the county was named for them by European-American settlers.

The name is sometimes mistakenly attributed to honoring Arthur St. Clair, an American Revolutionary War general and governor of the Northwest Territory, but it was established long before he was considered a notable figure. The earlier spelling of the lake&#x27;s name may have been conflated with English practice and the name of the general, as several political jurisdictions near the lake and the river, such as St. Clair County, St. Clair Township, and the cities of St. Clair and St. Clair Shores, share this spelling (see List of Michigan county name etymologies).

The name has sometimes been mistakenly attributed to honoring Patrick Sinclair, a British officer who purchased land on the St. Clair River at the mouth of the Pine River. In 1764, he built Fort Sinclair there, which was in use for nearly 20 years before being abandoned. As noted, the name was established before he was active in the area.

==Geography==

In 1822, the Michigan Territorial legislature defined a new county, Shiawassee (named for the river), taken from portions of existing Oakland and St. Clair counties. However, for purposes of representation, revenue, and judicial matters, the area was temporarily assigned to adjoining county governments. In early 1837, the Michigan Territory was admitted into the Union as the State of Michigan, and that same year the new Michigan State government authorized the organization of a county government in Shiawassee.

==Geography==
According to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.9%) is water. The Shiawassee River enters it from Genesee County in the southeast and flows through Corunna and Owosso in the center of the county, exiting to Saginaw County in the north. Shiawassee County is considered to be a part of Central Michigan.

The county government operates the jail, maintains rural roads, operates the major local courts, records deeds, mortgages, and vital records, administers public health regulations, and participates with the state in the provision of social services. The county board of commissioners controls the budget and has limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local government functions — police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance, etc. — are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.

===COVID-19 hazard pay scandal===
On July 25, 2021, it was revealed that the county&#x27;s board of commissioners paid themselves a total of $65,000 out of a $557,000 federal relief funds earmarked for county employee hazard pay due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Employees typically received $1,000 to $2,000. The seven member board of commissioners voted themselves $5,000 for four members, $10,000 for two, and the chairman of the county commissioners $25,000. Following days of criticism, a Shiawassee prosecutor declared the bonuses illegal; commissioners responded that they would return the money.

The original boundary of the county was reduced in 1840, when parts were partitioned off to create Huron and Tuscola counties. The county government was fully organized on December 31, 1849.
In the middle of the 19th century, the area now called Port Sanilac was called Bark Shanty. It was named for a lone shanty made of bark, which was used to make shingles from pine. The county seat of Sanilac is the city of Sandusky.

<text>Saginaw County () is a county located in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 190,124. The county seat is Saginaw. The county was created by September 10, 1822, and was fully organized on February 9, 1835. The etymology of the county&#x27;s name is uncertain. It may be derived from &quot;Sace-nong&quot; or &quot;Sak-e-nong&quot; (), as the Sauk () tribe is believed by some to have once lived there. A more likely possibility is that it comes from Ojibwe words meaning &quot;place of the outlet&quot; –&quot;sag&quot; () and &quot;ong&quot; (). &quot;See&quot; List of Michigan county name etymologies.

Saginaw County comprises the Saginaw, MI Metropolitan Statistical Area and is included in the Saginaw-Midland-Bay City Combined Statistical Area, the 5th largest metropolitan area in Michigan.

==Etymology==
The name Saginaw is widely believed to mean &quot;where the Sauk were&quot; in Ojibwe, from &quot;Sace-nong&quot; or &quot;Sak-e-nong&quot; (Sauk Town), due to the belief that the Sauk once lived there. But it is more likely that the name means &quot;place of the outlet&quot;, from the Ojibwe &quot;sag&quot; (opening) and &quot;ong&quot; (place of).

When indigenous people he met told Samuel de Champlain that the Sauk nation was on the western shore of Lake Michigan, Champlain mistakenly placed them on the western shore of Lake Huron. This mistake was copied on subsequent maps, and future references identified this as the place of the Sauks. Champlain himself never visited what is now Michigan.

==History==
The area was inhabited from about 1000 B.C. to 1000 A.D. by the Native American Hopewell culture, followed by the Anishnabeg. Some historians believe that the Sauk at one time lived in the area and were driven out by Ojibwe (Chippewa), before the area was first visited by Europeans.

The Saginaw region includes an extensive network of many rivers and streams which converge into the Saginaw River and provided a means for easy travel for the Native American population among numerous settlements and hunting areas, as well as access to Lake Huron. Saginaw was also a frequent meeting location for councils of the Ojibwe, Pottawatomi, and Ottawa—the Three Fires of the Anishnabeg.

What is today Saginaw County was inhabited by the Ojibwe at the time of the arrival of Euro-Americans. The Ojibwe were still the dominant force in the area in the 1820s, and in 1827 they were attacked by a two groups of Winnebago people coming from Wisconsin. The Ojibwe prevailed in this fight with the aid of local Euro-American settlers.

In 1853 the Ojibwe and Ottawa both established large hunting camps along the Saginaw River, although Euro-American settlers were beginning to establish saw mills and farms in the area by that point.

==Geography==

public health regulations, and participates with the state in the provision of welfare and
other social services. The county board of commissioners controls the
budget but has only limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local
government functions — police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street
maintenance, etc. — are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.

From 1988 to 2012, Saginaw County was a consistently Democratic county at the Presidential level. However, in recent elections it has become increasingly competitive, with Donald Trump narrowly winning the county in 2016 by slightly over 1,000 votes while narrowly losing it in 2020 by about 300 votes. Trump won it back in 2024, this time by a margin of about 3,400 votes and taking an outright majority in the county too.

The county board of commissioners controls the budget and has limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local government functions — police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance, etc. — are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.

The county was authorized by state legislative action on April 1, 1840, but the county government was not established until 1871. The government was reorganized in 1875. The name is an anglicisation of the French word &quot;presqu&#x27;île&quot; or &quot;presque-isle&quot;, which means a peninsula, or literally, &quot;almost an island&quot;. A large part of Presque Isle Township consists of that peninsula, with Lake Huron on the east, Grand Lake on the west, and narrow strips of land connecting it to the mainland at the north and south ends. The community of Presque Isle is near the center of this peninsula.

==History==
Early Native Americans living in the area were nomadic, using the land as hunting grounds. To them the land between the Ocqueoc and Swan Rivers was sacred ground. The name &quot;Presque Isle&quot; was given to the area by French fur traders who portaged over the strip of land that attaches Presque Isle to the mainland.

Early development of the area was delayed because it had no navigable river. The Ocqueoc River was Presque Isle&#x27;s largest river but it was shallow and crooked, with many rapids. In the spring of 1839 a surveying party, contracted by the state of Michigan, reported that the land of this area was worthless. This further discouraged development until the 1860s when the Crawford family settled into a quiet cove of Lake Huron, south of present-day Rogers City. They intended to develop a stone quarry, but found the stone too flaky to be used as building material. Turning to lumbering, they sold the wood to steamers traveling the Great Lakes.

In 1868 W.E. Rogers, an Army officer, organized a surveying party to Presque Isle, with Albert Molitor as supervisor. Seeing the huge forests, they attempted to purchase Crawford&#x27;s Quarry but were refused. They formed the Molitor-Rogers Company purchasing the land at the site of Rogers City. The following year a large party of German and Polish immigrants arrived and settled in the area. The Molitor-Rogers Company built a sawmill, store, boarding house, and blacksmith shop. The small city was solely supplied by the company. After a difficult winter in 1870–71, the community began to thrive.

The county&#x27;s original settlers were lumbermen, fishermen and farmers. In 1907 a mining engineer/geologist from New York, H.H. Hindshaw, visited Crawford&#x27;s Quarry and found it to be rich in limestone. Following this discovery, the Michigan Limestone and Chemical Company of Calcite, Michigan, was founded. The company purchased at Calcite, the new name for Crawford&#x27;s Quarry. Needing a means of shipping their product, the Bradley Transportation Company was formed. The company is known in the area for being the chief business, employing a significant portion of the area&#x27;s residents. One of the darker aspects of the county&#x27;s history involved the Bradley Transportation Company when one of their cargo ships, the &quot;Carl D. Bradley&quot; sank on Lake Michigan during a windstorm in November 1958 with the loss of 33 lives, 28 of whom resided in Presque Isle County (23 were from Rogers City, three were from Onaway and two were from Posen or Metz Township).

Today the world&#x27;s largest limestone processing plant is in Rogers City, which is also a major Great Lakes Port. This is the best natural harbor on Lake Huron between Port Huron and Mackinaw City.

The county is named for the Ottawa Nation. It was set off in 1831 and organized in 1837. Ottawa County is included in the Grand Rapids-Kentwood, MI Metropolitan Statistical Area and has a significant Dutch American population.

== History ==
Before European settlers arrived, this area was home to the Potawatomi and Ottawa people for centuries. The Grand River was used as a trade route into the interior of Michigan. Much of what we know about the Native American presence in Ottawa County comes from the excavation of archeological artifacts at places like the Battle Point Site.

The city dates its European-American founding to French colonial settlers. A fur trading outpost called &quot;Gabagouache&quot; was first established by Madeline La Framboise and her husband Joseph.

The first permanent settler of the county was a Presbyterian minister, William Montague Ferry, who settled in Grand Haven in 1834. Grand Haven quickly grew and became an important port for trade and travel. Ferry is often referred to as the &quot;father&quot; of Ottawa County.

Dutch settlers started arriving in the area in 1847, led by Albertus van Raalte. These Dutch Settlers moved into the Holland area. This area was already inhabited by many Odawa (Ottawa) people as well as the Old Wing Mission. Within just a few years, the new Dutch settlers had forced out the Ottawa people and the Old Wing Mission.

The county board of commissioners controls the budget and has limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local government functions – police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance etc. – are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.

Most of the county&#x27;s offices are located in either the city of Grand Haven or at the Fillmore complex in Olive Township.

* County Commissioners
* County Treasurer – Cheryl Clark

Since the late 19th century, the county has been strongly supportive of the Republican Party.

As of 2023, the county&#x27;s board of commissioners, a majority of whom are members of the advocacy group Ottawa Impact, has been described as &quot;far-right&quot; by national and Michigan-based media organizations. After the 2022 elections in which they took power, the board appointed Trump administration official John Gibbs to serve as the county administrator. In February 2024, the Board of Commissioners voted 10–1 to fire Gibbs for cause.

===Board of Commissioners===
11 members, elected from districts (1 Democrat, 10 Republicans)

===Local policies===
Beginning in 2012, County Administrator Alan Vanderberg and the Board of Commissioners adopted the &quot;Four Cs&quot; Initiative including &quot;Cultural Intelligence.&quot; At that time, Vanderberg asserted that there was discrimination in the county, and that it could adversely affect the future prosperity of the county. The county &quot;rebranded&quot; in 2017, adopting the slogan &quot;Where you belong.&quot; Vanderberg said the slogan is intended to let everyone know they are welcome in Ottawa County, regardless of color, ethnic background, sexual identity, religion or other qualifier.

The county board made numerous changes at their first meeting when sworn in on January 3, 2023; the county slogan was changed to &quot;Where Freedom Rings&quot;, the Diversity, equity, and inclusion office was dissolved, the head health official was replaced and a conservative law organization their main legal representative. The conservative group that promoted the new board members, according to Fox 17, was against the mandated COVID-19 safety measures and cultural diversity policies. Instability surrounding the county board raised concerns about the county&#x27;s bond credit rating being lowered from its AAA status according to MLive. In May 2023 the county board passed a resolution declared that the county was a &quot;constitutional county.&quot;

==Politics==












Ottawa County has long been the most consistently Republican county in Michigan and one of the most Republican in the country, although it has become less Republican since 2020. The last Democratic presidential candidate to carry the county was George B. McClellan in 1864. In 1912, incumbent Republican president William Howard Taft lost the county to &quot;Bull Moose Party&quot; candidate and former Republican President Theodore Roosevelt.

Being part of a local &quot;Bible Belt&quot;, the county is very Republican even by the standards of traditionally Republican west Michigan. As a measure of how Republican the county has been since 1864, it has rejected Democratic presidential candidates even in national Democratic landslides. It was one of the few counties where Franklin Roosevelt was shut out in all four of his presidential bids, and was one of only three counties in the state to vote for Barry Goldwater over Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Lyndon Johnson won 45% of the county&#x27;s vote, the last time a Democrat won at least 40% of the county&#x27;s vote. During the 1986 gubernatorial election, it was the only county not to back James Blanchard for a second term. The college town of Holland is the only place where Democrats win the majority of residents.

In 2008, it was one of the only two counties in Michigan where Barack Obama did not win 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote, and his weakest county, being the only one where John McCain received more than 60 percent of the vote, as he won it by 24 points while Obama carried the state by 16.5 points. In 2024, Kamala Harris had the best performance of any Democratic presidential candidate in Ottawa County since 1964, though she still lost the county by 20 points. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan, county officials and their families faced death threats following the introduction of mask mandates at public schools, with conservative groups influencing the 2022 Michigan elections to &quot;preserve local heritage&quot;. A new county government that some described as holding Christian nationalist values was subsequently elected in the 2022 elections.

Perhaps the most prominent politician in Ottawa County History was Grand Haven&#x27;s Thomas W. Ferry. Thomas Ferry served as an Ottawa County Clerk at age 21. He went on to become a member of the Michigan House of Representatives, the Michigan Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. While in the U.S. Senate, he served as President Pro Tempore (during the 44th and 45th congresses). As Pro Tempore, he became, upon the death of Vice President Henry Wilson on November 22, 1875, next in the line of presidential succession, and remained so until March 4, 1877.

<text>Otsego County ( ), formerly known as Okkuddo County, is a county located in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the population was 25,091. The county seat is Gaylord. The county was founded in 1840 and organized in 1875.

==Etymology==
Otsego may be a Native American name meaning &quot;place of the rock&quot;. However, an alternative theory is that it derives from a lake and a county in New York state, which are said to bear the name derived from a Mohawk Iroquoian word meaning either &quot;clear water&quot; or &quot;meeting place.&quot; It may be a neologism coined by Henry Schoolcraft, who was a borrower of words and pieces of words from many languages (including Arabic, Greek, Latin, and various American Indian languages). See List of Michigan county name etymologies.

==History==
The county was created in 1840 as Okkuddo County (meaning &quot;sickly water,&quot; although the reason for using a name with such a negative meaning is lost). The name was changed to Otsego in 1843 after the county in New York, with the name ultimately deriving from a Mohawk or Oneida word meaning &quot;place of the rock.&quot; It was organized in 1875. On May 20, 2022, an EF3 tornado struck the county seat of Gaylord killing 2 and injuring 44 while causing major damage to the downtown business district and severely damaging a mobile home park.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.1%) is water. It is the fifth-smallest county by total area in Michigan. Although it is located on Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula, Otsego County is considered to be part of Northern Michigan.

Otsego County has more than 370 lakes, mostly in the southern part of the county. Otsego Lake is the county&#x27;s largest and has a surface area of . Other large lakes in the southern part of the county include Big Lake, Big Bear Lake, Buhl Lake, Crapo Lake, Dixon Lake, Douglas Lake, Guthrie Lake, Heart Lake, Lake Tecon, Manuka Lake, Opal Lake, Pencil Lake, and Turtle Lake. The larger lakes in the northern part of the county are Five Lakes, Hardwood Lake, Lake Twenty Seven, and Pickerel Lake. Many of these are so-called &#x27;kettle lakes,&#x27; formed by the melting of blocks of glacial ice, left as the glacier retreated, which created a depression in the soil.

Glaciers shaped the area, creating a unique regional ecosystem. A large portion of the area is the Grayling outwash plain, a broad outwash plain including sandy ice-disintegration ridges; jack pine barrens, some white pine-red pine forest, and northern hardwood forest. Large lakes were created by glacial action.

Headwaters of the Au Sable, Black, Manistee, Pigeon, and Sturgeon Rivers are in Otsego County. The Au Sable River watershed is the county&#x27;s largest watershed.

==History==

The county was established on April 1, 1840, by act of the Michigan State legislature. However, its governing structure was not completed until 1881.

<text>Osceola County ( ) is a county in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 22,891. The county seat is Reed City.

==History==
When established by the Michigan Legislature on April 1, 1840, it was named Unwattin County, after Chief Unwattin of the local Ottawa people. As a representative of the Ottawa nation, he participated in negotiations for the Treaty of Washington (1836) that granted a vast expanse of Michigan to the US Federal Government. The name was changed March 8, 1843, to Osceola, after the Seminole chief who achieved renown in Florida.

The county was initially attached for administrative purposes to Ottawa County. In 1855, it was attached to Mason County; in 1857, to Newaygo County; and in 1859, to Mecosta County.

As the population increased, separate county government was organized in 1869, with Hersey designated as the county seat. Reed City became the official county seat in 1927. The county was developed initially for harvesting and processing lumber, and many European Americans came to work in lumbering and the mills.

==Geography==
The low rolling hills of Osceola County were completely wooded prior to settlement; at present about half of the area has been cleared and converted to agricultural or urban use. There are numerous small lakes and ponds scattered across the county; the largest is Rose Lake, northeast of LeRoy. The highest point on the terrain ( ASL) is Grove Hill, in Sherman Township. According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (6.7%) is water. The county is drained by the Muskegon River and branches of the Manistee River. Osceola County is part of Northern Michigan.

<doc id="95050" wikidata="Q45438" url="?curid=95050" title="Ontonagon County, Michigan">
<text>Ontonagon County ( ) is a county in the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the population was 5,816, making it Michigan&#x27;s third-least populous county. The county seat is Ontonagon. The county was set off in 1843, and organized in 1848. Its territory had been organized as part of Chippewa and Mackinac counties. With increasing population in the area, more counties were organized. After Ontonagon was organized, it was split to create Gogebic County. It is also the westernmost county in United States that lies within the Eastern Time Zone.


== History ==
In 1843, Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula was divided into Mackinac, Chippewa, Marquette, Schoolcraft, Delta, and Ontonagon Counties. In 1845, a portion of Ontonagon County was partitioned to be part of Houghton County. In 1846, the village of Ontonagon was named as the county seat of Ontonagon County.

Ontonagon County is part of Copper Country, a region of the Upper Peninsula with prevalent copper mining from 1845 until the late 1960s. Prehistoric mining was conducted by local Native American populations. The first attempts by Europeans to mine copper in the area came in 1771 in the Ontonagon River. The Ontonagan Copper Boulder was removed from the west branch of the Ontonagon River and transported in 1842 to Detroit where it was weighed at 3708 pounds, thence to the Smithsonian Institution. The last copper mine in Copper Country was the White Pine mine, which closed in 1995.

=== Etymology ===
The county is named after the Ontonagon River. The name is said to be loosely derived from an Ojibwe language word &quot;noojitoon ziibi&quot;, meaning &quot;hunting river.&quot; A French transliteration, &quot;Nantounagon,&quot; identified the river on a 1670 French map. Alternatively, and perhaps more accurately, it is said to be derived from the Ojibwa &quot;onagon&quot;, which means &quot;dish&quot; or &quot;bowl.&quot; &quot;See&quot; List of Michigan county name etymologies.

<text>Ogemaw County ( &quot;&quot;) is a county located in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the population was 20,770. The county seat is West Branch. The county newspaper of record is the &quot;Ogemaw Herald&quot;.

==History==

Ogemaw County started as part of the Virginia Land owned by England. After the Revolutionary War, it broke up into smaller and smaller pieces. The county was originally created by the Michigan Legislature in 1840 from unorganized territory, but was absorbed into Iosco County in 1867. It was re-created in 1873, and was finally organized in 1875. The county&#x27;s name is an Anglicization of the Anishinaabemowin word &quot;ogimaa&quot;, meaning &quot;chief&quot;. Ogemaw&#x27;s name came from an eloquent, respected Native American orator named Little Elk. One of the first settlements in the county was Ogemaw Springs, the genesis of lumbering operations in the county. The settlement of Ogemaw Springs ended when the lumber industry in the region ended. (Due to the lumber industry, railways were built to transport the lumber, and towns often sprang up along the tracks. After timber supplies in the Midwest dwindled, loggers shifted westward to the Pacific Northwest to find new sources of lumber, and many of these fledgling settlements foundered.) With Ogemaw Springs in decline, the people flocked to West Branch, causing an economic boom, including the construction of its first hotel. This created even more growth, causing many restaurants, hotels, and businesses to be built, a vast majority of which still stand today.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.0%) is water. Ogemaw County is considered to be part of Northern Michigan.

<text>Oceana County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 26,659. Its county seat and largest incorporated community is Hart. Oceana County is located in the West Michigan region of the state&#x27;s Lower Peninsula. The county has a shoreline along Lake Michigan, which has allowed for agriculture and tourism to flourish within the county. The county is also known as the &quot;Asparagus Capital of the World&quot;, and is home to the National Asparagus Festival, in Hart.

==History==
Prior to European American settlement, Oceana County was part of the territory of the Ojibwe. Early European American settlers were attracted by access along the White River, which reaches its mouth on Lake Michigan in Muskegon County to the south.

The State of Michigan created the county of Oceana on April 1, 1840. The county was organized in 1855. The origin of the county&#x27;s name is unclear, although there are two possibilities: the county may have been named for Lake Michigan, the freshwater &quot;ocean,&quot; which forms its western border; or for the book &quot;Oceana&quot;, written by English author James Harrington in 1656.

In the 1850s about 1400 Odawa were relocated here from Ionia County, Michigan by the federal government.

The county economy was first built on the lumber trade, with logs floated downriver. It later was developed for agriculture. In the 21st century, it is known for its commodity crop of asparagus. Oceana County is famous as the &quot;Asparagus Capital of the World&quot; for its high production of asparagus. The annual Asparagus Festival includes a parade and crowning of the Asparagus Queen.

<text>Oakland County is a county in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is a principal county of the Detroit metropolitan area, containing the bulk of Detroit&#x27;s northern suburbs. Its seat of government is Pontiac, and its largest city is Troy. As of the 2020 census, its population was 1,274,395, making it the second-most populous county in Michigan (behind neighboring Wayne County), and the most populous county in the United States without a city of 100,000 residents. Founded in 1819 and organized the following year, Oakland County is composed of 62 cities, villages, and townships. In 2010, Oakland County was among the ten wealthiest counties in the United States to have over one million residents. It is also home to Oakland University, a large public institution that straddles the border between the cities of Auburn Hills and Rochester Hills.

==History==
Founded by Territorial Governor Lewis Cass in 1819, sparsely populated Oakland County was formed from Macomb County on 28 March 1820. As was customary at the time, as populations increased, other counties were organized from its land area. Over the next 16 years, Oakland lost territory to the creation of the counties of Lapeer (10 Sep 1822), Saginaw (10 Sep 1822), Sanilac (10 Sep 1822), Shiawassee (10 Sep 1822), Washtenaw (10 Sep 1822), Barry (29 Oct 1829), Calhoun (29 Oct 1829), Eaton (29 Oct 1829), Ingham (29 Oct 1829), Jackson (29 Oct 1829), Kalamazoo (29 Oct 1829), Arenac (2 Mar 1831), Gladwin (2 Mar 1831), Midland (2 Mar 1831), Livingston (21 Mar 1833), and Genesee (28 Mar 1835).

Woodward Avenue and the Detroit and Pontiac Railroad helped draw settlers in the 1840s. By 1840, Oakland had more than fifty lumber mills, processing wood harvested from the region and the Upper Peninsula. Pontiac, located on the Clinton River, was Oakland&#x27;s first town and became the county seat. After the Civil War, Oakland was still primarily a rural, agricultural county with numerous isolated villages. By the end of the 19th century, three rail lines served Pontiac, and the city attracted carriage and wagon factories. In the late 1890s streetcars were constructed here and operated between Detroit.

At that time, developers made southern Oakland County a suburb of Detroit; a Cincinnati firm platted a section of Royal Oak called &quot;Urbanrest&quot;. Migration worked both ways. Several thousand people moved from Oakland County farms to Detroit as the city attracted factories. By 1910, a number of rich Detroiters had summer homes and some year-round residences in what became Bloomfield Hills. The auto age enveloped Pontiac in the early 1900s. The Oakland Motor Car Company was founded in 1907 and became a part of General Motors Corp., which was soon Pontiac&#x27;s dominant firm.

In the 1950s, Oakland County&#x27;s population boomed as the Detroiters began migrating to the suburbs. While the neighboring Macomb County was more inhabited by auto workers and other blue-collar workers, Oakland County&#x27;s residents tended to be more affluent and generally white-collar (e.g. doctors, lawyers). Oakland County was for a time the fourth-wealthiest county in the United States, though its position has declined somewhat since the Great Recession. The median price of a home in Oakland County increased to $164,697, more than $30,000 above the national median. Oakland County is home to several super-regional shopping malls such as Oakland Mall, Somerset Collection, Twelve Oaks Mall, and Great Lakes Crossing Outlets.

==Geography==


According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (4.4%) is water.

Oakland County was originally divided into 25 separate townships, which are listed below. Each township is roughly equal in size at by six miles, for a total township area of . The roots of this design were born out of the Land Ordinance of 1785 and the subsequent Northwest Ordinance of 1787. Oakland County itself is a prime example of the land policy that was established, as all townships are equal in size (save for slight variations due to waterways). Section 16 in each township was reserved for financing and maintaining public education, and even today many schools in Oakland County townships are located within that section.

Wayne County, where the city of Detroit is located, borders Oakland County to the south. 8 Mile Road, also known as &quot;Baseline Road&quot; in some areas, is the boundary between these counties. The baseline was used during the original surveying for Michigan, and it serves as the northern/southern boundaries for counties from Lake St. Clair to Lake Michigan. As more working and middle-class populations moved to the suburbs from the 1950s on, this divide (8 Mile Road) became historically known as an unofficial racial dividing line between what became the predominantly black city and almost exclusively white suburbs.

Since the late 20th century, the patterns of &quot;de facto&quot; segregation have faded as the suburbs have become more diverse. Middle-class African Americans have left Detroit, settling in inner-ring suburbs, notably Southfield (where the population is 75% Black), west of Woodward Avenue. Based on the 2010 census, the following cities also have significant non-white populations: Farmington (25.3%), Farmington Hills (31.7%), Novi (30.12%), Oak Park (62.61%), Lathrup Village (72.97%), Orchard Lake Village (16.08%), Rochester Hills (20.94%), Troy (29.4%), Wixom (26.28%), West Bloomfield (24.0%), Bloomfield (18.28%), Bloomfield Hills (14.2%), Ferndale (17.2%), and Madison Heights (17.7%). Ferndale has a concentration of Arab Americans, who also live in nearby areas, and numerous Asian Americans, particularly Indians, have also settled in these areas.

===Adjacent counties===
* Lapeer County (northeast)
* Genesee County (northwest)
* Macomb County (east)
* Wayne County (southeast)
* Washtenaw County (southwest)
* Livingston County (west)

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census there were 1,274,402 people and 524,762 households in the county with an average of 2.4 persons per household. 70.0% were Non-Hispanic White alone, 13.9% Black or African American alone, 8.8% Asian, 0.3% American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 2.5% of two or more races. 5% were Hispanic or Latino (of any race). Roughly 13.1% of county residents were foreign-born.

Of households in the county, 20.0% had children under the age of 18 living in them, and 19.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. About 50.6% of county residents were female. Roughly half (49.5%) of county residents ages 25+ had at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

Among Asian Americans, eight ethnic groups had more than 1,000 members in the county in 2000. The most numerous were those of Asian Indian descent, with 20,705. Next were those of Chinese heritage, numbering 10,018. Next were those of Japanese (5,589), Filipino (5,450) Korean (5,351), Vietnamese (1,687), Pakistani (1,458) and Hmong (1,210) ancestry.

In 2001, Oakland County had the 36th largest Asian population of any county in the country. In 2002, of the Oakland-Wayne-Macomb tricounty area, Oakland County had 49% of the tri-county area&#x27;s Asian population.

The median income for a household in the county in 2020 was $92,620, making Oakland County the 71st wealthiest county in the United States and the wealthiest county in Michigan. Of housing units in the county, 71.9% were owner occupied. About 8.72% of the population were below the poverty line.

==Government==
The county government operates the major local courts, keeps files of deeds and mortgages, maintains vital records, administers public health regulations, and participates with the state in the provision of welfare and other social services. The county board of commissioners controls the budget but has limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local government functions—police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance, etc.—are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.

===Service Center===
Most county operations are based at the Oakland County Service Center, which straddles Telegraph Road, split between Pontiac and neighboring Waterford Township. The east campus (in Pontiac) consists mostly of the courthouse, jail, and Sheriff&#x27;s Office, while the west campus (in Waterford) contains the county executive&#x27;s office, Children&#x27;s Village (the county&#x27;s juvenile detention center), and the headquarters of Oakland Schools, the Road Commission, and a number of other departments.

In May 2023, the county government announced a plan to relocate select offices from the Service Center back to downtown Pontiac.

===Elected officials===
* County Executive: Dave Coulter (D-Ferndale)
* Prosecuting Attorney: Karen McDonald (D-Birmingham)
* Sheriff: Mike Bouchard (R-Bloomfield Hills)
* County Clerk/Register of Deeds: Lisa Brown (D-West Bloomfield)
* County Treasurer: Robert Wittenberg (D-Huntington Woods)
* Water Resources Commissioner: Jim Nash (D-Farmington Hills)
* Board of Commissioners: 19 members, elected from districts (13 Democrats, 6 Republicans)

===Law enforcement===
The Oakland County Sheriff&#x27;s Office is the largest sheriff&#x27;s department in the state of Michigan. In 2017 it had 859 uniformed officers, although in 2022 it had nearly 100 unfilled vacancies. Republican Michael Bouchard has served as the Oakland County Sheriff since 1999.

Ten townships, 3 cities, and 2 villages in the county do not have municipal police forces, but rather contract with the sheriff for police services specific to the municipalities. Those municipalities are Addison Township (including the village of Leonard), Brandon Township (including the village of Ortonville), Clarkston, Commerce Township, Highland Township, Independence Township, Lyon Township, Oakland Township, Orion Township, Oxford Township, Springfield Township, Pontiac, and Rochester Hills. The Oakland County Sheriff&#x27;s Office also operates the county jail, a civil division, marine division, alcohol and traffic enforcement units, and an aviation division. The marine patrol and rescue unit patrols 450 lakes across the county.

===Road Commission===
Roads that are not maintained by a local community (city/village) are maintained by the independent Road Commission for Oakland County, which is governed by three board members appointed by the Oakland County Board of Commissioners.

==Politics==













Oakland County was historically a bastion of suburban conservatism, and was hence a longstanding stronghold of the Republican Party. In the 1990s it became highly competitive, and since 2008 it has increasingly shifted Democratic, giving over 50% of its votes to the Democratic candidate for president in each election. Republican strength is concentrated in the many exurban townships of the county, while Democratic strength is concentrated in suburbs such as Royal Oak, Farmington Hills, West Bloomfield, and Southfield. Some suburbs, such as Novi, Troy, Birmingham, and Rochester, were historically strongly Republican but are now relatively split between the two parties, with younger adults tending to support Democrats and older residents tending to support Republicans.

In 1996, Bill Clinton became the first Democrat to carry Oakland County since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and only the fourth to do so since 1892. Al Gore and John Kerry also carried the county, by narrow margins of less than 7,000 and 3,000 votes respectively, against George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, respectively. In 2008, the county swung significantly to Barack Obama, who became the first Democrat to win a majority in the county since LBJ, and only the third to do so since 1884. (&quot;See table at right&quot;.) He again carried the county in 2012, though by a smaller margin. Hillary Clinton won a narrow majority in 2016. In 2020, Joe Biden won 56 percent of the vote. He received over 400,000 votes, and became the first Democrat to carry the county by a margin of over 100,000 votes.

While the Democratic Party has found increasing success in presidential elections in Oakland County, the state Republican Party has remained strong in some recent gubernatorial and state elections. The county favored Republican Rick Snyder by a 22-point margin in the 2010 Michigan gubernatorial election and again by a 12-point margin in the 2014 election; conversely, the county favored Democratic candidate Gretchen Whitmer by a 17-point margin in the 2018 election and again by a 23-point margin in the 2022 election. Republicans held a majority on the County Commission for most of its history, but following the 2018 elections, Democrats won a narrow 11–10 majority on the commission.

In the 118th Congress, Oakland County is represented by four Democrats: Debbie Dingell (6th), Elissa Slotkin (7th), Haley Stevens (11th), and Rashida Tlaib (12th) and two Republicans: John James (10th) and Lisa McClain (9th).

==Transportation==

===Air===
* Oakland County International Airport (PTK) (Waterford Township) – General aviation and charter passenger flights.
* Oakland/Troy Airport (VLL) (Troy) – General aviation and charter passenger flights.

The following airports are located in neighboring counties:
* Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW) – Major commercial airport and hub for Delta Air Lines and Spirit Airlines located in Wayne County.
* Bishop International Airport (FNT) – Commercial airport located in Genesee County.
* Coleman A. Young International Airport (DET) – General aviation airport in Detroit.

===Major highways===
* is the main north–south highway in the region, serving Flint, Pontiac, Troy, and Detroit, before continuing south (as the Fisher and Detroit-Toledo Freeways) to serve many of the communities along the shore of Lake Erie.
* runs northwest–southeast through Oakland County and (as the Jeffries Freeway) has its eastern terminus in downtown Detroit.
* runs north–south from I-75 in the south to the junction of I-96 and I-696 in the north, providing a bypass through the western suburbs of Detroit.
* runs east–west from the junction of I-96 and I-275, providing a route through the northern suburbs of Detroit. Taken together, I-275 and I-696 form a semicircle around Detroit.
* ends just outside of Clarkston at I-75. To the south, US 24 serves suburban Detroit and Monroe before entering Ohio. Much of US 24 in Oakland County is named Telegraph Road, and it is a major north–south road extending from Toledo, Ohio, through Monroe, Wayne, and Oakland Counties to Pontiac. It gained notoriety in a song (&quot;Telegraph Road&quot;) by the group Dire Straits.
* has a northern terminus in Pontiac. The route continues southerly from Oakland County into the City of Detroit, ending downtown. The Detroit Zoo is located along M-1 in Oakland County. M-1 is also home to the Woodward Dream Cruise, a classic-car cruise from Pontiac to Ferndale that is held in August. It is the largest single-day classic-car cruise in America.
* (Haggerty Connector) provides expressway access from Commerce and West Bloomfield Townships at Pontiac Trail to the I-96/I-275/I-696 interchange, then follows the Farmington bypass to Grand River Avenue west of Middlebelt Road, continuing along Grand River into downtown Detroit.
* runs largely parallel to I-75 from Southfield to downtown Detroit. The service drives are named Northwestern Highway.
* (Ortonville Road, Main Street in Clarkston)
* has a southern terminus at I-75 northeast of Pontiac. To the north, the route continues to Lapeer and beyond. Note: M-24 and US 24 do not intersect at present, although this was the case until the 1950s.
* runs north–south from I-94 in Allen Park to Southfield. North of Nine Mile Road, the freeway ends and continues as Southfield Road into Birmingham.
* (Highland Road [from Pontiac westerly], Huron Street [within Pontiac] and Veterans Memorial Freeway [Pontiac to Utica]), continues east in Macomb County as Hall Road to Clinton Township and west to I-96 near Howell
* Perhaps better known as 8 Mile Road, M-102 follows the Oakland–Wayne county line for most of its length. 8 Mile Road, known by many due to the film &quot;8 Mile&quot;, forms the dividing line between Detroit on the south and the suburbs of Macomb and Oakland counties on the north. It is also known as Baseline Road outside of Detroit, because it coincides with the baseline used in surveying Michigan; that baseline is also the boundary for a number of Michigan counties. It is designated M-102 for much of its length in Wayne County.
* serves as a spur highway from M-59 into the city of Rochester.
* Grand River Avenue connects the suburbs of Brighton, Novi, and Farmington to downtown Detroit. The avenue follows the route of old US 16 before I-96 replaced it in 1962. It is one of the five roads planned by Judge August Woodward to radiate out from Detroit and connect the city to other parts of the state.

===Intercity rail===
Amtrak&#x27;s thrice-daily &quot;Wolverine&quot; serves Oakland County, with stations in Pontiac, Troy, and Royal Oak, before continuing on to Detroit and west to Chicago.

===Mile roads===
Surface-street navigation in metro Detroit is commonly anchored by &quot;mile roads&quot;, major east–west surface streets that are spaced at one-mile (1.6 km) intervals and increment as one travels north and away from the city center. Mile roads sometimes have two names, the numeric name (e.g., 15 Mile Road), used in Macomb County, and a local name (e.g., Maple Road), used in Oakland County (for the most part).

===Bicycling===
The conditions on most non-residential roads in Oakland County are not favorable to bicycling. Exceptions to this are primarily in the inner-ring suburbs within the southeast corner of the county. This is due to their street grid.

A primary reason for these unfavorable cycling conditions is the Road Commission for Oakland County has a policy of not accommodating bicycles on the road. As a result, some communities have designated sidepaths (locally called &quot;safety paths&quot;) as bike routes which do not meet the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) guidelines for bicycling facilities and have been found to be less safe than on-road bike facilities.

As a result, there are no designated Bicycle Friendly Communities within Oakland County.

Only the city of Ferndale has a built comprehensive bicycle network of bike lanes and signed shared roadways.

==Education==
The County of Oakland counterpart in public education (K–12) is the Oakland Schools, an Intermediate school district. The county is also home to multiple renowned private elementary and high schools, including The Roeper School and Cranbrook.

The Detroit Pistons played at the Silverdome from 1978 to 1988. The Silverdome was also the site of Super Bowl XVI, where the San Francisco 49ers defeated the Cincinnati Bengals, the first of 5 Super Bowl titles for the 49ers. The Pontiac Silverdome also hosted various other sporting events, prior to being demolished in 2017.

From 1988 to 2017, prior to the move to Little Caesars Arena in Detroit, the Detroit Pistons played their home games at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills. The Palace of Auburn Hills was demolished in 2020.

In Michigan, most local government functions – police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance etc. – are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.

<doc id="95056" wikidata="Q63719" url="?curid=95056" title="Muskegon County, Michigan">
<text>Muskegon County ( ) is a county in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of 2020, the population was 175,824. The county seat is Muskegon.

Muskegon County comprises the Muskegon, MI Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is part of the larger Grand Rapids-Kentwood-Muskegon, MI Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Around 1812, Jean Baptiste Recollect and Pierre Constant set up trading posts in the area. By the Treaty of Washington (1836), Native Americans ceded parts of Michigan, including future Muskegon County, to the United States. This opened up the area to greater settlement by European Americans, who developed farms.

Prior to 1859, the majority of Muskegon County was part of Ottawa County (the Southern three quarters). Grand Haven served as the County Seat of this combined County, and still serves as the Ottawa County seat today.

Muskegon County was organized in 1859. Its name is from the Muskegon River, which runs through it and empties into Muskegon Lake and subsequently flows into Lake Michigan. The word &quot;Muskegon&quot; comes from the Ojibwa/Chippewa word &quot;mashkig,&quot; meaning &quot;marsh&quot; or &quot;swamp&quot;. &quot;See&quot; List of Michigan county name etymologies.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (66%) is water.

Michigan&#x27;s second longest river, Muskegon River, flows through the county with its north and south branches emptying into Muskegon Lake. Muskegon Lake then empties into Lake Michigan via the Muskegon Channel. Muskegon Lake is Michigan&#x27;s only deep water port on Lake Michigan. In the north the White River flows through the county into White Lake and then on to Lake Michigan. In the south, Black Creek flows into Mona Lake which also flow into Lake Michigan. These three lakes allow boat navigation to and from Lake Michigan, making it one of the states most boat accessible counties, with Muskegon Lake allowing access for additional large commercial vessels.

==Government==
Prior to 1932, Muskegon County was a Republican Party stronghold in presidential elections, aside from 1912 where the split Republican vote primarily backed former president &amp; third-party candidate Theodore Roosevelt. The county became a Republican-leaning swing county from 1932 to 1988. It only supported a Democrat for president six times during this period; 1948 was the only election in this period that was not a national Democratic landslide.

Starting with the 1992 election, the county has consistently backed Democratic presidential candidates, and is one of the few Democratic bastions in traditionally Republican West Michigan. However, after narrowly losing the county in both 2016 and 2020 amid his surge in the Rust Belt, Donald Trump flipped it in 2024.














===County government===
The county government operates the jail, maintains rural roads, operates the
major local courts, keeps files of deeds and mortgages, maintains vital records, administers
public health regulations, and participates with the state in the provision of welfare and
other social services. The county board of commissioners controls the
budget but has only limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local
government functions — police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street
maintenance, etc. — are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.

<text>Montmorency County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the population was 9,153, making it the second-least populous county in Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula, behind its southern neighbor, Oscoda County. The county seat is Atlanta.

Montmorency County is part of Northern Michigan, and is part of the Lake Huron watershed. The Thunder Bay River, which drains much of the county, flows to Lake Huron&#x27;s Thunder Bay at Alpena.

==History==

The county was created by the Michigan Legislature in 1840 as Cheonoquet County, after a well-known Chippewa (also known as Ojibwa) Chief, whose name meant Big Cloud. Cheonoquet took part in Indian treaties in 1807, 1815, 1825 and 1837. Renamed Montmorency County on March 8, 1843, it was originally spelled Montmorenci, and historians conjecture this reflects the area&#x27;s French-Canadian influence: the French Duke of Montmorency purchased a lieutenant governorship in Canada and the first archbishop of Canada—Montmorency-Laval—both could be influences on the county&#x27;s name. (There was no &quot;Count Morenci&quot; aiding the American Revolution). The county was organized in 1881. The reason for the change in spelling is subject to some dispute. &quot;See&quot; List of Michigan county name etymologies. The name Montmorency probably means Mountain Moor. Montmorency is a boggy land or moor that is at the top of a broad mount or highland. When the county was organized in 1881, some land area was taken from Cheboygan and Alpena counties. Three townships were divided: Briley, Montmorency and Rust. By 1901 Albert, Hillman Township and Wheatfield were added. Brush Creek, now known as Hillman, was the first county seat. In 1891 the county seat was moved to Atlanta. 

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.8%) is water. Although it lies on Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula, Montmorency County is considered to be part of Northern Michigan.

Most of the county is covered by state forest land. There is an abundance of lakes, such as Long Lake. Glaciers shaped the area, creating a unique regional ecosystem. A large portion of the area is the Grayling outwash plain, a broad outwash plain including sandy ice-disintegration ridges, jack pine barrens, some white pine-red pine forest, and northern hardwood forest. Large lakes were created by glacial action.

==Economy==
Dairy products and dry beans are an important part of the county&#x27;s agricultural production. Service industry and retail trade relating to tourism make up most of the economic base in this rural area. Boating, fishing, and other outdoor activities are offered in abundance.

==Government==

==Recreation==
* Atlanta is the &quot;Elk Capital of Michigan&quot;. Every year during opening day of Elk hunting season the largest bagged are displayed at the &quot;buck pole&quot; on the town&#x27;s central square. During the off season, driving around in the wilderness surrounding Atlanta looking for these graceful creatures becomes a pastime of locals, cottagers, and tourists.
* Rainbow trout, brook trout, steelhead, perch, bass and other pan fish abound. The county is a hotbed of fly fishing and angling on the edge of some world-class streams and rivers.
*White tail deer hunting is a popular local activity and the firearms deer season opening (November 15) being noted as a holiday to some residents, with schools being closed on opening day. Most of the land in Montmorency County is controlled by state or federal government, making the county a popular hunting area.
*Snow shoeing, cross-country skiing and snow mobile riding are popular outdoor activities. The Sno*Drift rallying race is held on snowy surfaces in February.
*Morel mushroom hunting is a local pastime and attracts many tourists.
*There are many recurring events throughout the area, such as the annual sled dog races held near the end of January on Clear Lake State Park.
ORV/ATV and snowmobile trails are some of the state&#x27;s best. Many areas are designated as &quot;trail mazes&quot; on some maps. Montmorency County is one of the few counties that allow ATVs on public county roads, thus creating access for fuel, food and various hotels to Hillman, Atlanta, and Lewiston. The main trail system incorporates a scenic Elk tour and various levels of ATV trails.

==Media==
The newspaper of record for Montmorency County is the &quot;Montmorency County Tribune&quot;.

==Endangered species==
Montmorency County is home to Michigan&#x27;s most endangered species and one of the most endangered species in the world: the Hungerford&#x27;s crawling water beetle. The species lives in only five locations in the world, two of which are in Montmorency County, both inside the Mackinaw State Forest. The first site is along the East Branch of the Black River where two adult beetles were found in surveys in 1989 and two more again in 1996. In July 1999, six additional adult beetles were identified in the county living in Van Hetton Creek. This latter find was significant as it represented a new location beyond those originally identified when the Hungerford&#x27;s crawling water beetle was categorized as endangered on March 7, 1994, under the provisions of the US Endangered Species Act. The Van Hetton Creek sighting therefore provides the possibility that more of these very rare beetles might be found elsewhere in Montmorency County.

<doc id="95060" wikidata="Q195658" url="?curid=95060" title="Monroe County, Michigan">
<text>Monroe County is a county in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 154,809. The largest city and county seat is Monroe. The county was established as the second county (after Wayne County) in the Michigan Territory in 1817 and was named for then-President James Monroe. Monroe County is coterminous with the Monroe metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Before the county&#x27;s formation, the primary settlement was Frenchtown, which was settled in as early as 1784 along the banks of the River Raisin. The small plot of land was given to the early French settlers by the Potawatomi Native Americans, and the area was claimed for New France. The settlement of Frenchtown, Michigan and the slight northerly settlement of Sandy Creek drew in a total of about 100 inhabitants. During the War of 1812, the area was the site of the Battle of Frenchtown, which was the worst American defeat in the war and remains the deadliest conflict ever on Michigan soil. The site of the battle is now part of the River Raisin National Battlefield Park.

Monroe County was formed from the southern portion of Wayne County in 1817. At the time, the Michigan Territory, which had not yet received statehood, consisted of only Wayne County since Detroit was the only area which had a non-indigenous population over 1,000 people. When the area became more populated, the southern portion of Wayne County was broken off to form Monroe County; the settlement of Frenchtown was platted with the name &quot;Monroe&quot;.

The settlement also incorporated as a village in 1817 and became the county seat of Monroe County. The county and its county seat were named in honor of then-President James Monroe in anticipation of his upcoming visit to the city. Shortly after its formation, Monroe County&#x27;s population was recorded at only 336 in the 1820 census. When the county was originally formed, it stretched for inland (twice its current size), but the western half was split off to form Lenawee County in 1826.

Monroe County&#x27;s most famous resident, George Armstrong Custer (1839–1876), moved to Monroe as a child and lived with his half-sister and brother-in-law. Although not born in Monroe, he attended school in Monroe and later moved away to attend the United States Military Academy. He returned to Monroe in 1864 during the Civil War to marry Elizabeth Bacon (1842–1933), whom he met while previously living in Monroe. Much of Custer&#x27;s family resided in Monroe, included Elizabeth Bacon, Henry Armstrong Reed (1858–1876), and Boston Custer (1848–1876). After their deaths in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Henry and Boston were interred and memorialized in Monroe&#x27;s historic Woodland Cemetery, as are many members of Bacon&#x27;s family. Although George Custer died in the same battle, he was interred at West Point Cemetery and Elizabeth Bacon was buried next to him when she died many decades later. In 1910, then-President William Howard Taft and the widowed Elizabeth Bacon unveiled an equestrian statue of Custer which now sits at the corner of Elm Street and Monroe Street in the heart of downtown Monroe.

===Border disputes===
When the city of Toledo was incorporated in 1833, it was part of Monroe County instead of the state of Ohio. The small strip of land surrounding the mouth of the Maumee River was under the jurisdiction of the Michigan Territory, because the borders originally drawn up for the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 set a territorial boundary as the southernmost edge of Lake Michigan. When Ohio became the first in the Northwest Territory to gain statehood in 1803, the state&#x27;s northern border claimed this important area, even though the boundaries of the Michigan Territory when it was formally organized in 1805 also included this area. From 1833 to 1836, Toledo belonged to Monroe County, which led to the very heated Toledo War border dispute between the Michigan Territory and the state of Ohio for the area known as the Toledo Strip. In late 1836, President Andrew Jackson, who earlier had appointed his brilliant young aide Stevens T. Mason as the Michigan Territory&#x27;s &quot;boy governor&quot;, intervened to settle the dispute. The federal government gave the Toledo Strip to Ohio in exchange for Michigan getting the Upper Peninsula, then considered a wasteland, when it became a state on January 26, 1837. While Toledo was part of Monroe County, it surpassed Monroe in terms of size and population. In 1915, Michigan Governor Woodbridge N. Ferris and Ohio Governor Frank B. Willis called a ceremonial truce to the border conflict when new state line markers were erected.

The new state line at the end of the Toledo War was established at approximately the 41°44&#x27; north latitude line just north of the mouth of the Maumee River. This gave the river and the city of Toledo to the state of Ohio, but it also created an unintended consequence for a specific area of Michigan. The state line also cut through the smaller Ottawa River and inadvertently cut off a small section of Monroe County, creating an exclave known as the &quot;Lost Peninsula&quot; (). The few Michigan residents that live on the small peninsula must travel south into Lucas County, Ohio on a 10-minute drive before going north to get back to the rest of Michigan. The Lost Peninsula is administered by Erie Township and most of the peninsula contains a marina.

Monroe County&#x27;s boundary remained unchanged from 1837 to 1973, when a final unresolved dispute from the Toledo War was resolved, 136 years after the conflict. Ownership over the very small, uninhabited Turtle Island in a remote portion of Lake Erie was disputed for decades after the island&#x27;s lighthouse was shut down. The island was long controlled by Michigan but still disputed by Ohio. On February 22, 1973, an agreement was met, and state lines were redrawn for the last time to cut exactly through the tiny island, which divided the island between Monroe County and Lucas County. Erie Township has jurisdiction over the Michigan half of Turtle Island, and the city of Toledo controls the other half. What to do with the island remains a contentious issue since neither side can come to any agreement. Today, the island has several abandoned structures, and the recent building of new structures was halted by a court order.

===Economic history===
Prior to the mid-20th century, Monroe County remained largely agrarian and was well known for its numerous paper mills—the first of which was founded in 1834. In 1916, August Meyer founded Brisk Blast, which was a bicycle pump manufacturer that was later expanded to produce automotive shocks in 1919 as the Monroe Auto Equipment Company. In 1977, the company merged with the international Tenneco company. Today, their world headquarters are located in Monroe Charter Township and continue to manufacture Monroe Shocks and Struts. In 1927, cousins Edward Knabusch and Edwin Shoemaker founded a small furniture making company in their garage. This would later evolve into the worldwide La-Z-Boy Incorporated, and their world headquarters are located on North Telegraph Road in Monroe.

In 1957, the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station first opened in Frenchtown Charter Township near Lake Erie. Today, the plant is operated by Detroit Edison but is entirely owned by parent company DTE Energy. In 1974, the Monroe Power Plant, currently the fourth largest coal firing plant in North America, opened. At tall, the dual smokestacks are visible from over away and are among the tallest structures in the state. A third smokestack—shorter and wider than the other two—was constructed as the plant responds to meet environmental regulations. In 1929, Newton Steel opened a manufacturing plant on Lake Erie in Monroe, and this plant would later be purchased by Alcoa in 1942, Kelsey-Hayes in 1947, the Ford Motor Company in 1949 later under their Visteon division in 2000 and then as the Automotive Components Holdings in 2005. The plant, one of the most prominent manufacturing job in the county, produces various car parts for Ford. The plant itself is also well known for its high level of chemicals that once polluted Lake Erie and the River Raisin. Although threatened to close, the factory remains open with 1,200 employees. Today the Port of Monroe is still heavily industrialized and various other industries have moved to Monroe County in recent years. In 2001, Cabela&#x27;s built a store in Dundee. As one of the largest stores of its kind, this location is a major tourist destination and has greatly improved the economy of Dundee. The Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance was also founded in Dundee in 2002.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (19%) is water. Monroe is Michigan&#x27;s only county on Lake Erie. The River Raisin and Sandy Creek flow through the county. Sterling State Park is the county&#x27;s only state park and the only of Michigan&#x27;s 98 state parks located on Lake Erie. The Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge extends south into Monroe County and includes part of the North Maumee Bay Archeological District. Monroe County sits at the lowest elevation in Michigan, which is the shores of Lake Erie at .

===Climate===
Monroe County lies in the humid continental climate zone. The city of Monroe only receives an average of of snow a year — the lowest average snowfall for any large city in the state. July is the warmest month with an average high temperature of , and January is the coldest month with an average low temperature of . The county does not normally have extremely hot or cold temperatures. On average, the temperature only drops below a couple of times during a winter season, and it is even rarer for the temperature to rise above during the summer. The coldest recorded temperature was on February 5, 1918. The highest recorded temperature was on July 24, 1934, with another equal temperature recorded on one occasion many years earlier.

Severe weather events are very rare. Monroe County has experienced a total approximately 30 tornadoes since 1950. Infrequent waterspouts can also be seen out on Lake Erie. Many tornadoes have been a part of major outbreaks, and none have directly affected the heavily populated areas. Three separate F4 tornadoes killed 13 people during the 1965 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak on April 11, 1965. In the Super Outbreak of April 3–4, 1974, two tornadoes (one F2 and one F3) caused five deaths. The most tornadoes from a single storm came on August 29, 1979, when four tornadoes touched down in and near Monroe. However, the tornadoes were weak (three F1 and one F0), and there were no deaths. The most recent tornado to touchdown and cause significant damage in the county struck Dundee Township in a minor outbreak that caused several tornadoes around the southern portion of Michigan on the morning of June 6, 2010.

Since Monroe is too far north and inland, no hurricanes have struck Monroe County directly. However, some of the strongest hurricanes have affected the county with a few irregular inches of increased rainfall, although they have had no more power in the area than a depression does. Tropical Storm Candy (1968) traveled unusually far inland and dropped of rain. Other storms, such as Hurricane Hugo (1989) and Hurricane Isabel (2003) also dropped trace amounts of rain with over winds—long after they lost their hurricane status.

The county is a &quot;district of choice&quot; county, and students have the option to attend any district in the county, even if they do not live within a particular district. Students near the county line, especially those in northern locations such as Milan, Flat Rock, Milan Township, and London Township, are assigned to districts in the neighboring counties of Wayne and Washtenaw. Located primarily in Monroe County, Airport Community Schools and Whiteford Agricultural Schools have boundaries that extend into neighboring counties thus a small number of out-of-county students attend schools in Monroe County.

There are two charter schools in the county with a total of 750 students. There are also 15 parochial schools with approximately 2,200 students enrolled in the private sector. The county is also served by one independent school district, the Monroe County Intermediate School District, which provides education services and staff support at all of the county&#x27;s schools. Established in 1964 and first opened to students in 1967, Monroe County Community College is the only higher education institution in the county. Marygrove College, sponsored by the local Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (IHM), was founded in Monroe in 1905 as a Catholic, liberal arts college. The college moved to its current location in Detroit in 1927. The IHM also operated a boarding school, the Hall of the Divine Child, in Monroe from 1918 to 1980. Students in the county may be homeschooled.

===K-12 education===
Monroe County is served by 14 public school districts, with nine of them based in the county. The largest of these is Monroe Public Schools, which enrolls approximately 6,450 students in the city of Monroe and outlying area of the city limits. With around 2,100 students, Monroe High School is one of the largest high schools in the state. The Monroe County Intermediate School District is an independent school district that provides services to both public and private schools in the county. Students in Monroe County can choose to enroll in any public school district in the county, granted the district has available space. If a student attends a school outside of their normal district, the school will usually not provide transportation for the student. The district boundary map is provided by the Michigan Department of Information Technology. All district&#x27;s athletic teams are governed by the Michigan High School Athletic Association. A small number of schools have been closed down or reused for different purposes, and some of the smaller districts consists of a single elementary school and a combined middle and high school.

==Politics==












Monroe County was a swing county in presidential elections. It has voted for the winning candidate for president in 16 of the last 19 presidential elections, the only exceptions being in 1968, 2000, and 2020. In 2016, Donald Trump received 58% of the vote, the largest percentage since Ronald Reagan in 1984. In 2020, Trump outdid his 2016 total by winning 60.4% of the vote. In 2024, he yet again improved in the county, taking 62.8% of the vote, likely indicating that Monroe County is now a consistently Republican-leaning county.

The county prohibits construction of solar power plants.

==Transportation==
Portions of Monroe County are served by the Lake Erie Transit public transportation bus system. Established in 1975, Lake Erie Transit currently has a fleet of 31 buses and serves approximately 400,000 riders every year. In 2008, the system logged 764,000 miles. The system operates buses on eight fixed routes in and around the city of Monroe. It also serves several neighboring townships outside of its normal routes should a passenger call ahead for a ride. From Bedford Township, its provides transportation to and from two shopping malls in Toledo, Ohio.

* travels through the eastern portion of the county and provides access to Toledo to the south and Detroit to the north. I-75 provides an uninterrupted route as far south as South Florida and as far north as the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge.
* has its southern terminus just north of Monroe in the northeast portion of the county. Splitting off from I-75, I-275 is a western bypass around Detroit but does not actually merge back with I-75. I-275 serves as a main route to the Metro Airport.
* runs along the western portion of the county, passing right through Dundee and proceeding north through Ann Arbor. US 23 is a limited-access freeway with interchanges rather than intersections.
* travels through Monroe and provides access to Toledo and western portions of Detroit. The road is known locally as North Telegraph and South Telegraph—divided at the River Raisin. US 24 also connects to I-275 just north of Monroe.
* was the designated name for the portion of Dixie Highway north of Cincinnati, including the portion running through Monroe. Like Dixie Highway, US 25 was largely replaced, and the existing highway was truncated at Cincinnati.
* only runs a short distance through the southwestern corner of the county, where it connects Toledo to US 127 in Michigan. In Monroe County, it is known as St. Anthony Road, and the US 223 designation continues on a 90° bend south with US 23.
* has its eastern terminus is in Monroe at US 24 and provides a direct route from Monroe to Dundee and further into the state. In Monroe, M-50 is known locally as South Custer Road. In Dundee, it is referred to as East Monroe Street and, after the River Raisin, Tecumseh Road.
* travels directly through downtown Monroe before merging into US 24 north of Monroe. South of downtown after Jones Avenue, it is called South Dixie Highway. In the downtown area, it is South Monroe Street. North of the River Raisin, it is North Monroe Street.
* was a state highway existing from 1930 to 1955 and ran along the north banks of the River Raisin. M-130 had its eastern terminus at US 24 and ran for just over . In 1955, control of the highway was transferred back to the county and is now called North Custer Road.
* was a state highway existing from 1935 to 1977. It ran through the southern portion of the county, connecting US 23 to the now-decommissioned US 25. Today, the road is called Samaria Road, with the eastern portion called Lakeside Road.
* Dixie Highway ran through Monroe County in as early as 1915. Originally one of the few ways to reach places like Florida, the highway was largely replaced by I-75 beginning in the 1960s. Today, the namesake of the highway is used for two non-connecting highways (one being M-125), although the same route and remnants of the original highway are long gone.
* Custer Airport was built in 1946 and is located just west of downtown Monroe. It is a general aviation airport, with no commercial or passenger service. The airport has one paved runway primarily used by small private aircraft. There is also a small aviation school on the site.
* Toledo Suburban Airport, not to be confused with the much larger Toledo Express Airport, is located in the southwest portion of the county near Lambertville. Like the Custer Airport, this is a general aviation facility with one paved runway and no scheduled flights. It serves as a fueling station, a test center, and a flight instruction center.

===Election history===
Missaukee County is one of Michigan&#x27;s most strongly Republican counties, and one of the most consistently Republican in the nation since that party was founded. No Democratic presidential candidate has ever won Missaukee County since it was organized: even Lyndon Johnson in 1964 when he swept the Northeast received no more than 42 percent of the county&#x27;s vote, which made Missaukee Barry Goldwater’s strongest county north or east of the Great Lakes. No Democrat since has received more than Barack Obama&#x27;s 38 percent in 2008. In 2004, Republican George W. Bush received 68.1% in Missaukee County, his second highest percentage among Michigan&#x27;s 83 counties. In 2008, Republican candidate John McCain was held down to below 60 percent, the only time and it has happened since 1964 without a strong third-party showing (Ross Perot in both 1992 and 1996) and just the second time since 1936. Regardless, it was still his second-strongest county in Michigan after Ottawa County, as he won by 21 points while Barack Obama carried the state by 16.5 points. In 2016, 2020, and 2024, the county was Donald Trump&#x27;s strongest in Michigan as he won it all three times by more than 50 points. In 2002, Republican gubernatorial nominee Dick Posthumus received 66.1% in Missaukee, which also ranked it as the #2 most Republican county in the state.

Despite its strong Republican leanings, Missaukee County has voted for Democratic gubernatorial candidates on two rare occasions, those being for James Blanchard in 1986 and William B. Fitzgerald Jr. in 1978.

<text>Beloit ( ) is a city in Rock County, Wisconsin, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 36,657 people. Beloit is a principal city of the Janesville–Beloit metropolitan statistical area (Rock County) and is included in the Madison–Janesville–Beloit combined statistical area.

==History==
Twelve men in Colebrook, New Hampshire created the &quot;New England Emigrating Company&quot; in October 1836, and sent Horace White to find a suitable region of Wisconsin in which to settle. The level fields and the water power of Turtle Creek and &quot;unlimited gravel&quot; in the area around what is now Beloit fixed the site of the village and farms. White purchased the land. At the same time as the Colebrook settlers, six families from Bedford, New Hampshire, arrived and settled in the region. They said the Rock River Valley had a &quot;New England look&quot; that made them feel at home. The village was platted in 1838 and was planned with wide streets, building on the New England model.

Beloit was originally named New Albany (after Albany, Vermont) in 1837 by its founder, Caleb Blodgett. The name was changed to Beloit in 1838. The name was coined to be reminiscent of Detroit.
Beloit lays claim to such inventions as the speedometer, John Francis Appleby&#x27;s twine binder, and Korn Kurls, which resemble Cheetos, and the original puffed cheese snack.

<text>Midland County is a county located in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the population was 83,494. The county seat is Midland. The county&#x27;s name is due to its closeness to the geographical Lower Peninsula&#x27;s geographical center. It was founded in 1831. However, it was not until 1855 that the county was effectively organized.

Midland County comprises the Midland, MI Metropolitan Statistical Area and is included in the Saginaw–Midland–Bay City Combined Statistical Area in the Mid/Central Michigan region.

==History==

===Early history===
For many centuries, Midland County was inhabited by Native Americans, and by the time of European contact it was inhabited by the Chippewa Indian Tribe.

===19th century===

In the year of 1831, Midland County&#x27;s borders had been set. In 1850, Midland County was officially organized. In 1874, the Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad linked Midland to the nationwide railroad network. The City of Midland, the county seat, is officially incorporated in 1887, and 3 years later in 1890, Herbert Henry Dow arrives and founds the Dow Chemical Corporation, now one of the largest chemical companies in the world.

====Civil War====
When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, many men from the county enlisted in the Union Army, many in Company B of the 10th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and Company H of the 27th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment, but some ended up in different regiments. Not all of them came back alive and several were wounded. Many veterans of the war are also buried in the county. There were a total of 5 different Posts, or veteran groups, of the Grand Army of the Republic, a Union veterans organization, in Midland County.

Some of the regiments which included men from Midland County are: 10th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment, 27th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment, 29th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment, 16th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment, 3rd Michigan Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, 7th Michigan Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Michigan Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, 1st Michigan Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, and 23rd Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment.

===20th century===

In the 20th century the county saw significant growth with the entrenchment of the Dow Chemical Corporation and the establishment of major roads, highways, and a few minor airports. However, in the late 20th century the Pere Marquette Railroad was closed, which cut off passenger train travel from the region.

====World War 1====
In World War 1, once the US had entered the war in 1917, the Dow Chemical Corporation, based mainly in the city of Midland, was involved with the production of poisonous gases for use during the war, and with the production of ammunition. Additionally, 675 men from Midland joined the US military during the war, and 8 of them died in the line of duty.

====World War 2====

In World War 2, many men from the county enlisted in the US Military, and several would die. Additionally Dow turned its factories towards supplying the war effort and they would assist in manufacturing explosives, flares, and medicine. There is also a large memorial to veterans from Midland County from this war.

====Cold War====
During the Cold War, an Army National Guard depot was set up in the city of Midland. In the Vietnam War, Dow and the rest of Midland County were the main suppliers of Napalm used during the conflict. Several men would also die in the Korean War and Vietnam War.

===21st century===
In the 21st century, the Sons of Union Veterans, the successor to the Grand Army of the Republic, founded the U.S. Grant Camp No. 67, which serves the Midland, Saginaw, and Bay City area. During the War on Terror, many men from the county enlisted and few died. The Midland County Veterans Memorial was refurbished. The city of Coleman also built a new war memorial. Curiously, none of these memorials reference the service of Midland men in the Civil War.

In May 2020, Midland County residents in parts of the city of Midland, the village of Sanford, Edenville Township, Midland Township, Tittabawassee, Thomas Township, Saginaw Township, Lincoln Township, Homer Township and Dow Chemical were forced to evacuate due to high flooding which was caused by the breach of the Edenville and Sanford dams.

==Politics==













Midland County is rather conservative for an urban county. It has been a consistent stronghold of the Republican Party, having supported its presidential candidates in every election from 1968 onward and all but twice since 1884. It is one of the few counties where Franklin D. Roosevelt was shut out in all four of his successful campaigns.

==Government==
The county government operates the jail, maintains rural roads, operates the
major local courts, keeps files of deeds and mortgages, maintains vital records, administers
public health regulations, and participates with the state in the provision of welfare and
other social services. The county board of commissioners controls the budget but has only limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local government functions — police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance, etc. — are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.

===Sheriff=== 
In 2012, Sheriff Jerry Nielsen renamed the Road Patrol Division to the Citizens Assistance Responders Division (CAR). Due to funding cuts, the department no longer had the staff to be proactive and prevent criminal activity. The philosophy changed to respond and provide assistance to citizens.&lt;br&gt; 
The Sheriff&#x27;s Department also operates the 250-bed jail that opened in late 2009. The Sheriff&#x27;s department redesigned their website in 2006 to provide timely information to citizens and encourage them to submit tips and questions.

<doc id="95066" wikidata="Q74686" url="?curid=95066" title="Mecosta County, Michigan">
<text>Mecosta County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 39,714. The county seat is Big Rapids.

The county is named after Chief Mecosta, the leader of the Potawatomi Native American tribe who once traveled the local waterways in search of fish and game. Chief Mecosta was one of the signers the Treaty of Washington in 1836. The easily navigated waterways soon led to a boom in lumber industry growth. Workers settled the area in 1851, and the county was officially settled and the government officially organized in 1859. Mecosta County is home to over 100 lakes, rivers, and streams with the Muskegon River winding its way through the county seat and largest city Big Rapids (originally named Leonard).

Mecosta County was set off on April 1, 1840, but remained attached for administrative purposes to Kent County until 1857, when it was attached to Newaygo County. The county government was organized on February 11, 1859, with the village of Leonard as its seat.

Mecosta County comprises the Big Rapids, MI, Micropolitan Statistical Area and is included in the Grand Rapids-Wyoming-Muskegon, MI, Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
The surveyor general approved the United States survey of Mecosta County on February 22, 1839, and the state legislature established the county boundaries on April 1, 1840.

In 1852, John Davis purchased in Mecosta Township and John Parish purchased in Big Rapids. They were the first two permanent county residents. On July 20, 1852, the first family to reside in the county, William and Margaret Brockway and their two children, moved into a logging shanty on Mitchell Creek. On February 12, 1853, Alice Victoria Brockway was born to the couple. Alice was the first white child born in the county. In the spring of 1853, the Brockways moved to a farm in Aetna Township.

In March 1854, Zerah and George French and nine members of their family moved to a shanty close to Mitchell Creek and the Muskegon River. Zerah and George French are considered the co-founders of Big Rapids. In the spring of 1855, James and Laura Montague and their children became the third family to settle in the county. Their farm in Green Township was located where 19 Mile Road intersects the west bank of the Muskegon River.

The organization of Leonard (Big Rapids) Township and Green Township was authorized in February 1858. On April 5, 1858, the first township elections were held and Jesse Shaw was elected supervisor of Leonard Township and Jesse A. Barker was elected supervisor of Green Township. On February 11, 1859, the State Legislature authorized the organization of Mecosta County and established the Village of Leonard as the county seat. The first county elections were held on April 4 and these county officials were elected: Orrin Stevens, Clerk and Register of Deeds; Alfred L. Clark, Sheriff; Charles Shafer, Treasurer; Jesse A. Barker, Judge of Probate; and Augustine N. Williams, Surveyor. Mr. William T. Howell of Newaygo was appointed Prosecuting Attorney. On May 2, Luther Cobb and Jesse A. Barker convened the first meeting of the board of supervisors and Jesse A. Barker was chosen chairman. The population of Mecosta County was 671 inhabitants in 1860.

The first issue of the &quot;Big Rapids Pioneer&quot;, a five-column folio, was printed on April 17, 1862. Charlie Gay was the proprietor, owner, and co-editor with Ceylon C. Fuller. The paper was under the same management for nearly 22 years, and 140 years later, the paper is still being published.

The plat for the Village of Big Rapids was recorded on November 3, 1859, and the plat for French&#x27;s addition (Glen Elm) was recorded on May 9, 1860. The state legislature authorized the incorporation of the City of Big Rapids in April 1869. The first city elections were held on April 19, 1869, when these officials were elected: George F. Stearns, Mayor; Charlie Gay, Recorder; W. Irving Latimer, Treasurer; and William Van Loo, Supervisor. Mecosta County had 5,642 residents in 1870.

The Grand Rapids and Indiana was the first railroad to enter Mecosta County. In June 1869, the GR&amp;I railroad crossed the Little Muskegon River and the Village of Morley was created. Construction of the next section of track to the Village of Paris started in late July 1869 and the Village of Stanwood came into existence. The GR&amp;I reached the city limits of Big Rapids on June 20, 1870, and the Village of Paris on July 1, 1870. Construction of the GR&amp;I continued for several years until the line reached Petoskey in December 1873.

Early county prisoners were housed in the county sheriff&#x27;s private house, a local hotel, the Kent County jail, or the Newaygo County jail. In 1862, county residents decided not to erect a county jail. The first county jail was erected in the summer of 1868, situated where the Old Historic Jail built in 1893 is presently located on Stewart Street. Construction for the present county jail was completed in 1965. This jail was renovated in 1986. The Mecosta County Board of Commissioners approved another jail renovation and expansion in 2000 with scheduled completion in 2001.

The 1880 census reported Mecosta County to have a population of 13,973. In the early 1880s, rented county offices were located in two downtown buildings near the corner of Elm and Michigan. In 1883, the Board of Supervisors submitted to the voters the proposition to authorize a two-year tax for the purpose of erecting a county courthouse. County voters passed the courthouse tax issue in April 1884. Construction on the first courthouse began in 1885 and was completed in 1886. A ground-breaking ceremony for the present Mecosta County Building (second courthouse) occurred on April 8, 1969. Construction of the Mecosta County Building was completed in late August 1970 and a dedication ceremony was held on November 7, 1970.

In the early 1900s, water power harnessed by hydroelectric dams became the energy base for the manufacturing of furniture and other wood products. The extraction of bedrock deposits of oil, gas, glacial sand, and gravel soon became important economic activities. Although logging activities dominated early history, health services and education have become more significant and enduring forces in shaping the community. Mecosta County has grown in population through the years to over 42,000 with a wealth of opportunity in industry, education, and small-town country living.

Mecosta County was first settled by African Americans in the 1860s when James Guy obtained in Wheatland Township, with a deed signed by Abraham Lincoln. The Homestead Act of 1862 allowed each settler , resulting in African Americans owning in the area where Remus sits today. They were woodsmen and farmers who established schools and churches in their community. Referred to as the &quot;Old Settlers&quot;, a reunion is held every year in the Remus area to celebrate those who originally settled here.

Woodbridge N. Ferris, who later became a Michigan governor, established Ferris Industrial School in 1884 in Big Rapids. The school became Ferris Institute, Ferris State College, and is currently home of the Bulldogs and Ferris State University. Before his death in 1928, Ferris had trained 50,000 students and attained a yearly enrollment of 1,800. As of 2010, enrollment was over 14,000, but has since declined.

The tourist industry within the area has had steady growth and is now an important source of income while development opportunities continue to exist. With Mecosta County&#x27;s numerous lakes, streams, and rivers opportunities for water and fishing activities are limitless: golf courses, bike trails, and other outdoor experiences.

===Ice Mountain bottling plant===
In 2009, Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation won their controversial case, The Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation v Nestle Waters North America, which had begun in 1999. The Nestle/Perrier/Great Spring Waters of America/Ice Mountain bottling plant in Stanwood, Mecosta County, began production on May 23, 2002, extracting groundwater from the Muskegon aquifer that qualifies as a source of “spring water” under federal law. The case has the potential of being one of the most important cases in terms of influencing and defining Michigan&#x27;s water law jurisprudence. The decision involves the interpretation and application of the common law and several environmental statutes, mainly the Michigan Environmental Protection Act, the Inland Lakes and Streams Act, and the Wetland Protection Act. Citizens, disappointed by the inaction of the Michigan Department for Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and their disinclination to adequately monitor the bottling plant, had formed their own organization to conserve Michigan&#x27;s water. For example, in 2003, the MDEQ, although they had determined that the bottling plant had already had a &quot;measurable impact on certain waters and wetlands&quot;. MDEQ argued that &quot;water levels in the impacted waters&quot; in 2003 were at the &quot;highest levels they have been in three years, thereby mitigating concern over possible imminent harm associated with Nestlé’s continued operation at a reduced rate of 250 gallons per minute (gpm) averaged over a monthly time period.&quot; In 2009, an out-of-court settlement was reached. &quot;Nestle/Ice Mountain’s water pumping permit was reduced by almost half. Nestlé agreed to lower its spring pumping in Mecosta earlier in the spring during fish spawning and continue low pumping during the summer months to protect the already stressed stream and lake.&quot;

==Government==
Marquette County was reliably Republican following the American Civil War; its voters went Republican (or Republican-splinter) in every election from 1876 through 1932. However, that shifted in 1936; since then, the Republican nominee has carried the county in only five out of 23 elections through 2024, four of which were nationwide Republican landslides and the other had native Michigander Gerald Ford as the Republican nominee. At present, it has since become the only Democratic-leaning county in the Upper Peninsula. It was the only Upper Peninsula County to vote for Democratic presidential candidates in 2016, 2020, and 2024.














The county government operates Sawyer International Airport, the jail, maintains rural roads, operates the major local courts, records deeds, mortgages, and vital records, administers public health regulations, and participates with the state in the provision of social services. The county board of commissioners controls the budget and has limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local government functions—police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance, etc.—are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.

<text>Macomb County ( ) is a county on the eastern shore of the U.S. state of Michigan. It is part of the Detroit metropolitan area, bordering Detroit to the north and containing many of its northern suburbs. Its seat of government is Mt. Clemens, and its largest community is Warren. As of the 2020 census, the county had a population of 881,217, making it the third-most populous county in the state, behind neighboring Wayne and Oakland. Macomb County contains 27 cities, townships and villages, including three of the ten most-populous municipalities in Michigan. Most of this population is concentrated south of Hall Road (M-59), one of the county&#x27;s main thoroughfares.

==History==
The Ojibwe lived in the area for centuries before European contact and were preceded by other cultures of ancient indigenous peoples.

The first European colonists were French, and they arrived in the area during the 17th century. Other early settlers were French fur trappers, who sometimes married Ojibwe women, and Jesuit missionaries. A Moravian colony was established in the county in the late 18th century. In addition to the original French and English settlers, later immigrants included Germans, Belgians, and others from Europe. In the 19th century, the county received many European-American migrants from New York and New England, who were attracted to the area for land and booming jobs in the lumber and other resource industries.

Macomb County was formally organized on January 15, 1818, as the third county in the Michigan Territory. The county was named in honor of Detroit-born Alexander Macomb, Jr., a highly decorated veteran of the War of 1812 and hero of the Battle of Plattsburg. He was made Commanding General of the U.S. Army in 1828.

As was typical in development, the county at first encompassed a much larger area than at present. As population increased in the area, the state legislature removed territory in 1819 and 1820 to form the counties of Oakland, Lapeer, Genesee, and St. Clair.

After World War II, Macomb and neighboring Oakland County grew rapidly due to the suburbanization - between 1950 and 1960 the county population more than doubled. However, as opposed to the more white-collar Oakland County, Macomb County residents were generally auto workers and other middle-class blue-collar workers.

In May 2008, Macomb County voters approved the inclusion of a County Executive in a new charter to be submitted to the voters by 2010. A charter commission was elected in November 2008 to draft a charter for submission to Governor Granholm, which was submitted and approved and placed on the November 2009 ballot. The Charter passed with a 60.4% to 39.6% margin.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (16%) is water. The county&#x27;s southeastern border with Canada is located across Lake St. Clair.

Lake St. Clair borders the county on the east.

Macomb County is mostly considered a part of Southeast Michigan. However, the far northern parts of the county, including Richmond and Armada, are often considered to be part of Michigan&#x27;s Thumb region.

The county comprises mostly rural/agricultural communities to the north and a mix of suburban and urban areas to the south.

About 4.00% of families and 5.60% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.00% of those under age 18 and 6.40% of those age 65 or over.

According to the 2006 American Community Survey, the average family size was 3.15. The population of 25 and over was 571,463. 86.9% of that population had graduated from high school, and 21% of the population had a Bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher. About 14.3% of that population was disabled. 12.5% of Macomb&#x27;s population could speak another language at home.

Of Michigan&#x27;s five largest counties, Macomb experienced the most population growth (102.5%) in the post-World War II years of accelerating suburban development, between 1950 and 1960. Its population has continued to grow to the present day, albeit at a slower pace since 1980.

==Parks and recreation==
Macomb County is home to more than 130 parks covering managed by the state, regional, county, and local government. There are four major public parks in the County - Freedom Hill County Park, Macomb Orchard Trail, Lake St. Clair Metropark, and Stony Creek Metropark. The county also has 31 miles of shoreline and over 100 marinas.

==Government==













The county government operates the jail, maintains rural roads, operates the major local courts, keeps files of deeds and mortgages, maintains vital records, administers public health regulations, and participates with the state in the provision of welfare and other social services. The county board of commissioners, which for the 2023–24 term is chaired by Don Brown, controls the budget and creates and adopts ordinances and resolutions related to County functions. In Michigan, most local government functions — police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance, etc. — are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.

The Macomb Intermediate School District serves all school districts based in the county.

===Elected officials===
* County Executive: Mark Hackel (Democrat)
* Prosecuting Attorney: Peter Lucido (Republican)
* Sheriff: Anthony Wickersham (Democrat)
* County Clerk/Register of Deeds: Anthony Forlini (Republican)
* County Treasurer: Larry Rocca (Republican)
* Public Works Commissioner: Candice Miller (Republican)
* Macomb County Board of Commissioners: 13 members, elected from districts (5 Democrats, 8 Republicans)
* Circuit Court: 13 judges (non-partisan)
* Probate Court: 2 judges (non-partisan)

===Politics===
Macomb County has historically shown Republican tendencies in statewide elections, while tending to favor Democratic candidates at the federal and local level. Since the 2010s, Macomb County has shifted towards the Republicans, and after the 2020 elections the party gained control of the Board of Commissioners for the first time as well as four of the five countywide offices. The county gained fame in the 1980s and &#x27;90s as a bellwether of state and national politics. Macomb&#x27;s large cohort of middle-class, socially conservative White voters gave it one of the nation&#x27;s most prominent concentrations of &quot;Reagan Democrats&quot;. Outsider candidates with a conservative-populist bent have done well there in the past, such as Pat Buchanan in 1992 and Donald Trump in 2016, 2020, and 2024. Macomb County voters were primarily responsible for the failure of the 2016 Regional Transit Authority proposal to create a comprehensive public transit system in the Metropolitan Detroit region.

The more populated communities south of M-59 (Warren, Sterling Heights, Clinton Charter Township), closer to Detroit city proper are friendlier to Democrats. Warren leans Democratic, while Sterling Heights, after voting for Barack Obama in 2012, voted for Trump by about 12 points in both 2016 and 2020, but in 2018, voted for Gretchen Whitmer and Debbie Stabenow by 3 points, and Clinton Charter Township after voting for Obama in 2012, voted for Trump in 2016, but swung back to Whitmer and Stabenow in 2018 and Joe Biden in 2020. The communities north of M-59 further removed from Detroit are more strongly Republican, all backing Trump in 2016 and 2020 and Bill Schuette in 2018.

* runs –west through Detroit and serves Ann Arbor to the west (where it continues to Chicago) and Port Huron to the northeast. The stretch of the current I-94 freeway from Ypsilanti to Detroit was one of the first American limited-access freeways. Henry Ford built it to link his factories at Willow Run and Dearborn during World War II. It was called the Willow Run Expressway.
* runs east–west from the junction of I-96, I-275, and M-5 to I-94, providing a route through the northern suburbs of Detroit.
* is a major road that runs from Marysville to downtown Detroit. The portion of the road between 23 Mile Road and New Haven Road is not numbered. Between New Haven Road and Main Street in the city of Richmond, the road is part of M-19. Between Richmond and Marysville the road is not numbered.
* starts in New Haven goes up Gratiot to Richmond. The route leaves Gratiot and goes northwest through Richmond and then north through Memphis. Then it goes north through St. Clair and Sanilac Counties and ends at M-142 near Bad Axe in Huron County.
* begins as part of 23 Mile Road, east of I-94, and ends in Marysville.
* which is called the Van Dyke Freeway and Christopher Columbus Freeway from 18 Mile Road in Sterling Heights to 27 Mile Road in Washington Township. It is also called the POW/MIA Memorial Freeway from 27 Mile Road in Washington Township to the freeway&#x27;s end at 34 Mile Road in Bruce Township, however, it is locally known as the Van Dyke Freeway. It continues as Van Dyke Road or Van Dyke Avenue north to Port Austin and south through Warren to Gratiot Avenue in Detroit.
* (Veterans Memorial Freeway) from Utica to Pontiac, continues east as Hall Road to Gratiot Avenue and as William P. Rosso Highway to its terminus at I-94 and west as various surface roads to I-96 near Howell
* (Groesbeck Highway) begins in Detroit at Gratiot (M-3) and ends at Hall Road (M-59).
*, known by many due to the film &quot;8 Mile&quot;, forms the dividing line between Detroit on the south and the suburbs of Macomb and Oakland counties on the north. It is also known as Baseline Road outside of Detroit, because it coincides with the baseline used in surveying Michigan; that baseline is also the boundary for many Michigan counties.

===Other roads===

*Jefferson Avenue is a scenic highway that runs parallel to the shore of the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair. It is also the principal thoroughfare for the Grosse Pointes, where it is called Lake Shore Drive.
*Mound Road is a north-south divided highway running from a junction with Mt. Elliott Street in Detroit to Auburn Road north of M-59 in Shelby Township. It runs parallel to M-53/Van Dyke Road one mile to the west. Its massive stack interchange with I-696 is a remnant of a cancelled freeway upgrade that would&#x27;ve connected with a proposed extension of the Davison Freeway on the south end and the M-53 freeway via a connector along the 18 1/2 Mile Road corridor on the north end.
*&quot;Mile&quot; roads: Surface street navigation in Metro Detroit is commonly anchored by &quot;mile roads,&quot; major east–west surface streets that are spaced at one-mile intervals and increment as one travels north and away from the city center. Mile roads sometimes have two names, the numeric name (ex. 15 Mile Road) used in Macomb County and a local name (ex. Maple Road) used in Oakland County mostly. 

===Rail===
Into the end of the 1950s the New York Central Railroad operated multiple trains from Mackinaw City at the north end of Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula, with stops at Warren station. The last Bay City to Detroit passenger train through Warren stopped on March 19, 1964.

<text>Mackinac County ( , ) is a county in the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the population was 10,834. The county seat is St. Ignace. Formerly known as Michilimackinac County, in 1818 it was one of the first counties of the Michigan Territory, as it had long been a center of French and British colonial fur trading, a Catholic church and Protestant mission, and associated settlement. The county&#x27;s name is shortened from &quot;Michilimackinac&quot;, which referred to the Straits of Mackinac area as well as the French settlement at the tip of the lower peninsula. Mackinac County is one of two U.S. counties to feature shorelines on two Great Lakes, being Lake Huron and Lake Michigan (the other county being neighboring Chippewa County).

==History==

Michilimackinac County was created on October 26, 1818, by proclamation of territorial governor Lewis Cass. The county originally encompassed the Lower Peninsula of Michigan north of Macomb County and almost the entire present Upper Peninsula. As later counties were settled and organized, they were divided from this territory.

On April 1, 1840, areas in the Lower Peninsula were laid off to create 30 new counites. By 1841, the County of Michilimackinac was confined to the Upper Peninsula and its nearby islands, bordering Chippewa and Menominee counties.

On March 9, 1843, Michigan further divided the Upper Peninsula into six counties. At this time, the County of Michilimackinac more closely resembled its modern configuration, including only a portion of the Upper Peninsula closest to the Straits of Mackinac, plus several islands.

At the time of founding, the county seat was the community of Michilimackinac Island on Michilimackinac Island, later known as Mackinac Island, Michigan. This has been an important center for fur trading before the 1830s, when European demand declined. The county was organized in 1849 as Mackinac County. In 1882 the county seat was moved from Mackinac Island to St. Ignace, Michigan, which had been founded as a French Jesuit mission village during the colonial years.

Mackinac County is home to the Mackinac Bands of Chippewa and Ottawa Indians, a Native American state recognized tribe located in St. Ignace.

==Government==

Mackinac County is reliably Republican. Since the 1964 landslide of Lyndon B. Johnson, it has only supported a Democrat twice, and neither time with a majority of the vote. Bill Clinton won the county in his 1992 and 1996 victories; the latter remains the last time a Democratic presidential candidate has won the county.














The county government operates the jail, maintains rural roads, operates the major local courts, keeps files of deeds and mortgages, maintains vital records, administers public health regulations, and participates with the state in the provision of welfare and other social services. The county board of commissioners controls the budget but has only limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local government functions — police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance, etc. — are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.
