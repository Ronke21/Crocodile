<doc id="105097" wikidata="Q754886" url="?curid=105097" title="Codeshare agreement">
<text>A codeshare agreement, also known simply as codeshare, is a business arrangement, common in the aviation industry, in which two or more airlines publish and market the same flight under their own airline designator and flight number (the &quot;airline flight code&quot;) as part of their published timetable or schedule. Typically, a flight is operated by one airline (technically called an &quot;administrating carrier&quot; or &quot;operating carrier&quot;) while seats are sold for the flight by all cooperating airlines using their own designator and flight number.

The term &quot;code&quot; refers to the identifier used in a flight schedule, generally the two-character IATA airline designator code and flight number. Thus, XX224 (flight number 224 operated by the airline XX), might also be sold by airline YY as YY568 and by ZZ as ZZ9876. Airlines YY and ZZ are in this case called &quot;marketing airlines&quot; (sometimes abbreviated MKT CXR for &quot;marketing carrier&quot;).

Most of the major airlines today have code sharing partnerships with other airlines, and code sharing is a key feature of the major airline alliances. Typically, code-sharing agreements are also part of the commercial agreements between airlines in the same airline alliances.

==History==
In 1967, Richard A. Henson’s Hagerstown Commuter airline joined with US Airways predecessor, regional Allegheny Airlines, in the nation&#x27;s first codeshare relationship. The term &quot;code sharing&quot; or &quot;codeshare&quot; was coined in 1989 by Qantas and American Airlines, and in 1990 the two firms provided their first codeshare flights between an array of Australian and U.S. cities. Code sharing has become widespread in the airline industry since then, particularly in the wake of the formation of large airline alliances. These alliances have extensive codesharing and networked frequent flyer programs.

==Terminology==
Under a code sharing agreement, the airline that administers the flight (the one holding the operational permissions, airport slots and planning/controlling the flight and responsible for the ground handling services) is commonly called the &quot;operating carrier&quot;, often abbreviated OPE CXR, even though the IATA SSIM term &quot;administrating carrier&quot; is more precise. The reason for this is that a third carrier may be involved, typically in the case that the airline originally planning to operate the flight needs to hire a subcontractor to operate the flight on their behalf (typically a wet lease, meaning an aircraft is leased with crew and all facilities to fly, commonly due to capacity limitations, technical problems etc.) In this case, the airline carrying the passenger should be designated the operating carrier, since it is the one carrying the passengers/cargo.

When a flight is sold under several designators and flight numbers as described above, the one published by the &quot;administrating carrier&quot; is commonly called a &quot;prime flight&quot; (as opposed to a codeshare marketing flight).

==Reasons and advantages==
Under a code sharing agreement, participating airlines can present a common flight number for several reasons, including:

===For passengers===
* Connecting flights: This provides clearer routing for the customer, allowing a customer to book travel from point A to C through point B under one carrier&#x27;s code, instead of a customer booking from point A to B under one code, and from point B to C under another code. This is not only a superficial addition as cooperating airlines also strive to synchronize their schedules.

===For airlines===
* Flights from both airlines that fly the same route: this provides an apparent increase in the frequency of service on the route by one airline.
* Perceived service to non-serviced markets: this provides a method for carriers who do not operate their own aircraft on a given route to gain exposure in the market through display of their flight numbers.

==Types of code sharing==

There are several types of code sharing arrangements:
* Block space codeshare: A commercial (marketing) airline purchases a fixed number of seats from the administrating (operating/prime) carrier. A fixed price is typically paid, and the seats are kept away from the administrating carrier&#x27;s inventory. The marketing airline decides on its own which booking classes the seats are sold in (the block of seats are optimized just like another aircraft cabin).
* Free flow codeshare: The airlines&#x27; inventory and reservation systems communicate in real-time by messaging, commonly IATA AIRIMP/PADIS messaging (TTY and EDIFACT). A booking class mapping is defined between the airlines. No seats are locked to any of the airlines, and any airline can sell any number of seats.
* Capped free flow: Basically the same as above, but capping (maximum number of seats) is defined for each of the marketing airlines participating in the codeshare with the administrating carrier.

==Competitive concerns==
Much competition in the airline industry revolves around ticket sales (also known as &quot;seat booking&quot;) strategies (revenue management, variable pricing, and geo-marketing). Criticism has been leveled against code sharing by consumer organizations and national departments of trade since it is claimed it is confusing and not transparent to passengers.

==Air-rail alliances==

There are also code sharing arrangements between airlines and railway companies, formally known as air-rail alliances, and commonly marketed as &quot;Rail &amp; Fly&quot; due to the popularity of the Deutsche Bahn codeshare with many airlines. They involve some integration of both types of transport, e.g., in finding the fastest connection and allowing the transfer between plane and train using a single ticket. This allows passengers to book a whole journey at the same time, often for a discounted price compared to separate tickets.

<text>Brundidge is the second-largest city in Pike County, Alabama, United States. The population was 2,076 at the 2010 census, down from 2,341 in 2000.

The city was once a major producer of peanut butter. Brundidge holds a Peanut Butter Festival during the last Saturday of each October, which includes live music, a recipe contest, and a parade.

The city has a large number of antique stores in its historic downtown.

==History==

The town was founded prior to the Civil War by George C. Collier, who established a trading post and saloon. First called &quot;Collier&#x27;s Store&quot;, the town changed its name around 1854 to honor James M. Brundidge, a prominent citizen and founder of the local Masonic lodge.

During the Civil War, men from Pike County joined &quot;Company F&quot;, the &quot;Brundidge Guards&quot;, of the 15th Regiment Alabama Infantry.

Brundidge grew as an agricultural center after the war. A depot of the newly constructed Alabama Midland Railway was established in Brundidge in 1889. Several hotels and businesses followed. Passenger trains such as the &quot;South Wind&quot; once passed. The railway line is now the Dothan Subdivision, used for freight operations by CSX Transportation.

Brundidge incorporated in 1893. In 1900, the Brundidge Banking Company opened, followed by the First National Bank in 1904. Brundidge has had three newspapers: the &quot;Brundidge News&quot; began publication in 1893, the &quot;Brundidge Sentinel&quot; began in 1926, and the &quot;Brundidge Banner&quot; in 1962. All have ceased publication.

In the 1920s, Brundidge native Alonza E. Johnston opened a peanut butter mill, and his Johnston Oil Company was soon shipping more than two million jars per year. The company also produced velvet bread and mayonnaise, and operated warehouses, gins, and an ice plant.

The business has ceased operation. The old Johnston Mill and General Store has been adapted as a museum. The mill, as well as the Lightfoot House in Brundidge, are both listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage.

<text>Troy is a city in and the county seat of Pike County, Alabama, United States. It was formally incorporated on February 4, 1843.

Between 1763 and 1783, the area where Troy sits was part of the colony of British West Florida. After 1783, the region fell under the jurisdiction of the newly created United States of America.

As of the 2020 census, its population was 17,727, down from 18,033 in 2010. The 2022 estimated population was 17,774. The City of Troy had previously been considered one of the fastest-growing cities in Alabama. Troy is home to Troy University, the fourth-largest university in total enrollment in Alabama.

==History==
===Before the Civil War===
For many centuries, the area around Troy was settled by different tribes of Native Americans, but became primarily known for its Muskogee Creek presence. Most Creek tribes lived along rivers or streams at that time. Near the Troy area, many Native Americans settled around the Conecuh River and the Pea River.

With the coming of European explorers and colonists, the area of present-day Alabama was claimed by Spain, France, and Great Britain, although very few Europeans settled in the inland parts. After being swapped among those three powers in the course of the 18th century, the United States acquired the region from Spain with the Treaty of Madrid (1795) and created the Mississippi Territory in 1798, including most of the present-day states of Mississippi and Alabama. In 1819, the State of Alabama was admitted to the Union and was soon organized into counties. Pike County, founded in 1821, was one of the first counties established in Alabama. It comprised a large tract of country, so large that it was called the &quot;State of Pike&quot;, which included parts of what are now Crenshaw, Montgomery, Macon, Bullock, and Barbour Counties, and extended to the Chattahoochee River on the east.

After Pike County&#x27;s borders were resized, the land that later became Troy was settled in the early 1830s. Originally known as Deer Stand Hill (an Indian hunting ground), which was first settled about 1824, it was later known as Zebulon and then Centreville before being renamed Troy in 1838. Troy became the county seat that same year after a new county courthouse was built in the city, replacing the previous county seat town of Monticello. The court met in local stores until the courthouse was built in 1839. In 1880, this structure was torn down and rebuilt as an opera house, which was also eventually torn down. A brick courthouse was erected in 1880. A hotel and taverns along with small mercantile stores were soon created, quickly making the new town the social center of the county. Unfortunately, the town of Troy completely burned down in 1901 after a devastating fire, and had to be rebuilt. The courthouse, originally in the center of the town square, was demolished because of fire damage and relocated one block away just outside of the town square.

To promote movement of settlers and to speed mail from Washington City to New Orleans, the Federal Road was laid out after 1805. In 1824, a military road was laid out from Fort Barrancas in Pensacola, Florida, and ran on top of the ridges to Fort Mitchell in Russell County, Alabama, and connected to the Federal Road. Captain Daniel E. Burch of the U.S. Army marked the route using three notches on trees for a crew under Lt. Elias Phillips to follow. The route was eventually cleared in 1824 at a cost of $1,130. It followed the ridge dividing the watersheds of the Conecuh River to the northwest, and the Yellow River and Pea River to the southeast. This road became known as the Three Notch Road and ran through Troy and Pike County. While never being highly needed as a military supply road, it became a boon to the settlers who used it to move into south-central and southeast Alabama and into northwest Florida.

During this time, tensions began to rise between the local Creek Indians and the European settlers who were moving into the area. As settlers began to force their way onto Creek lands and push the Indians out, the Creeks began to retaliate, first in small factions, then in larger ones. During this time, the Second Indian War was beginning in the Southeastern United States.

Battle of Hobdy&#x27;s Bridge

On February 10, 1837, the Battle of Hobdy&#x27;s Bridge occurred after a force of over 100 American militiamen under Captain Jack Cooper intercepted about 75 Creeks making their way to Florida. After locating the site of the Creek camp, the militia divided into two groups to converge on the refugees by surprise.

A brief fight ensued upon their approach, which centered around two fallen trees the Creeks had used as a natural breastwork. The Creeks, being extremely low on ammunition, fired nails instead of bullets from the muskets they possessed. The militiamen eventually overran their position and captured the camp, wherein they found items recently plundered from area plantations. Exact casualties are unknown, but it is believed four or five Creeks and perhaps one American were killed. Though stripped of their supplies, the Creeks managed to continue their flight even as they continued to skirmish with other American troops. Near the Florida border, they retaliated by killing two American settlers.

Battle of Pea River

In of the last battles of the Second Creek War, on March 27, 1837, the Battle of Pea River occurred roughly 17 miles to the east of Troy, where the Pea River and Pea Creek converge near Hobdy&#x27;s Bridge. A force of over 250 combined Alabama and Georgia militiamen led under General William Wellborn tracked a party of about 400 Creek fugitives that included men, women, and children. The Creeks, angry that the land that had been promised to them was being taken from them by local settlers by violent force, responded by burning local homes and plantations along the Pea River swamp. The Three Notch Trail that traversed through Troy was also considered dangerous at this point, as local Creek Indians around the area were turning violent and burning and looting houses along the stretch. The path of the Creeks had become easy to find due to the several looted and burned plantations they had left behind them as they moved south. After finding their temporary camp in a nearby swamp, General Wellborn divided his command into two wings to encircle the Creeks. He personally commanded one wing, and placed the other under Colonel Jefferson Buford. The Creeks detected the approach, however, and attacked and scattered Buford&#x27;s wing.

When Wellborn&#x27;s command neared the camp, trudging through waist-high water, gunfire could be heard erupting further down the river. Wellborn ordered his men through the mud and water at a full run. Upon encountering the Creeks downstream, a fierce four-hour battle began on opposite sides of a nearby lagoon. The Creek warriors, many of whom were later found to have been using bullets made of melted pewter plates, made several unsuccessful charges on the militia&#x27;s line before being overrun. Records from some of the participants in the battle reported that some of the Creek women and children also took up arms to fight, raining showers of rifle balls and arrows on the militiamen. In one case, two of the Creek women attacked a member of the militia with knives. Unable to defeat the desperate Creeks with gunfire alone, Wellborn finally ordered a direct charge on their lines. The tactic worked, as many of the Creeks fled to their encampment to carry off their children, some even swimming the river to flee. The fighting then devolved into a massacre in which at least 50 Creek men, women and children were killed and an unknown number captured. The Creek survivors continued their flight south in small groups. According to some reports, some of the captured Creeks were enslaved by local planters. Only five Americans were killed, among them General Wellborn&#x27;s teenage son, James H. Wellborn.

In winning the Battle of Pea River &amp; Pea Creek, Wellborn had defeated the refugee Creeks but had failed to surround and capture all of them as he had hoped. Instead they fled south down the Pea River to its confluence with the Choctawhatchee and continued across the line into Florida. Furious at their treatment, they continued to battle the Whites for years to come.

===During Civil War===

At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the small village of Troy had a population around 600. The 57th Alabama Infantry Regiment of Troy was formed in 1863. The group of soldiers from that regiment fought at the Battle of Peachtree Creek on July 20, 1864.

Troy was mostly spared from the ravages of the war, except that its sons were dying on battlefields throughout the South. On April 26, 1865, a brigade of Union cavalry under the command of General Benjamin Henry Grierson camped outside of Troy. These soldiers moved on to Louisville, Clayton, and Eufaula the next day without incident. However, roughly 20 miles east of Troy at the Pike County border, the Skirmish at Hobdy&#x27;s Bridge, what some consider the last battle of the Civil War, took place on May 19, 1865.

Skirmish at Hobdy&#x27;s Bridge

A detachment of Union soldiers from the 1st Florida U.S. Cavalry had been sent from Montgomery to Eufaula to escort a mail shipment through the unsettled regions of eastern Alabama. General Robert E. Lee had already surrendered and Wilson&#x27;s Raid had just devastated the region, but many former Confederate soldiers were still drifting through the region trying to get home, which presented a threat.

A mail escort, commanded by Lt. Joseph Carroll of the Union Army, left Montgomery on May 11, 1865, and reached Eufaula without difficulty. The total strength of the detachment was only 25 men, but because all seemed quiet, Carroll decided to spend a few days in Eufaula to rest his horses. Since some of his men were natives of the area, he granted them short leaves to go to visit their families. The entire detachment was to reassemble at Hobdy&#x27;s Bridge over the Pea River on May 19, 1865.

After many of his men dispersed to their homes, however, Carroll learned that a party of pro-Confederate &quot;guerrillas&quot; had been seen in the area. The identity of this unit, if it had an identity, is unknown, but at about the same time, General Alexander Asboth in Pensacola reported that several companies of cavalry made up of &quot;unrepentant rebels&quot; were still active in the Alabama and Florida borderlands.

Upon receiving this intelligence, Carroll decided to return to Montgomery as quickly as possible and crossed Hobdy&#x27;s Bridge with the main body of his detachment two days before the appointed rendezvous. The other men of his command, at home and visiting their families, had no way to know of his decision to leave early or of the danger they faced.

According to military records, the remaining Union soldiers gathered at Hobdy&#x27;s Bridge as ordered on the morning of May 19, 1865, only to learn that Carroll and the main body were already gone. Turning their horses onto the long wooden bridge over Pea River, the cavalrymen started off to follow their commander&#x27;s route. Unfortunately, they rode straight into a group of Confederate rebel guerillas.

Three Confederate soldiers were wounded in the fight, and one Union soldier was killed, identified as Corporal John W. Skinner of Company C, 1st Florida U.S. Cavalry. He was killed in action six days after Private John J. Williams of the 34th Indiana, who died at Battle of Palmito Ranch, and is generally said to have been the last man killed in the Civil War. That sad distinction actually belongs to Corporal Skinner, who died on the wooden planks of Hobdy&#x27;s Bridge in Alabama.

===After the war===


During the Reconstruction Era after the end of the Civil War, Troy began to have new railroads and roads converging into the city. After the completion of the Mobile &amp; Girard Railroad (later part of the Central of Georgia Railway) in 1870, Troy had a quick spike in population. One of the many to have made the journey to Troy was Jeremiah Augustus &quot;Gus&quot; Henderson. Having owned a large store in nearby Gainers Store (now known as Henderson), he found it difficult to transport and receive shipments by wagon. In 1869, Henry moved his mercantile store to nearby Troy to be closer to the Mobile and Girard Railroad. One of his sons, Charles Henderson, would soon be the governor of Alabama and a large contributor to Troy.

Troy had a quick period of growth in the following years. By 1890, the Alabama Midland Railway (later part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad) was completed from Montgomery to Bainbridge, Georgia, via Troy. Rapid growth outside of the Troy downtown square consisted of factories, churches, stores, and Victorian-style houses. Many of the early houses, churches, and cemeteries dating back to this era can still be found in the College Street Historic District, just on the edge of historic downtown Troy. Many of the buildings in the two-block area date from as early as the 1870s. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 13, 1976.

In 1887, a group of local educators and prominent citizens of Troy joined to acquire a state normal school (teacher training school) for Troy. Thanks mostly to the efforts of Ariosto A. Wiley, a powerful state senator who was born in Troy, the city won the education prize over Lowndesboro, Alabama, which had also wanted a normal school. The school, which was to be known as Troy Normal School, was eventually constructed and completed in 1887 in downtown Troy on a four-acre campus.

This school, which went on to become Troy University, had a stormy early history and was lucky to have survived in its cramped downtown location. Its survival was assured when the third president of the college, Edward Madison Shackelford, led the movement from downtown to its present site starting in 1924. In 1929, the name was changed to Troy State Teacher&#x27;s College. The name was again changed in 1957 to Troy State College to reflect the expanded educational offerings of the school. The college underwent yet another name change in 1967, being called Troy State University until reaching its current name, Troy University, in 2005.

During the late 1800s into the early 1900s, Troy experienced steady growth thanks to the railroads, multiple factories, and the college.

==Geography==
Troy is located at (31.808768, −85.969951). It is in the East Gulf Coastal Plains region of Alabama. It is located along the Troy Cuesta ridge, which runs across the state from east to west and is the boundary that separates the Chunnenuggee Hills and Southern Red Hills geographical boundaries. Elevations commonly reach in these hills and can reach up to in some areas. About north of Troy near the Montgomery area, the Chunnenuggee Hills region ends and the flat Black Prairie region begins, commonly known as the Black Belt region. About south of Troy in the Dothan area, the Southern Red Hills region ends and the Dougherty Plains region begins. Map

Much of the region consists of pine forests. Most tree species found in the area are pine, hickory, oak, pecan, and poplar. The 231-mi-long Conecuh River flows at the northern end of Troy. A lake called Pike County Lake is located at the southern end of Troy.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and (0.34%) is covered by water.

==Climate==

Troy&#x27;s climate is described as humid subtropical using Köppen climate classification. It is typical of areas along the Gulf of Mexico in that it has hot, humid summers and mild winters. (See table below for average temperatures for Troy.)

During the summer and fall, Troy is occasionally affected by tropical storms and hurricanes. The most recent major hurricanes to affect Troy have been Hurricane Opal, Hurricane Ivan, Hurricane Katrina, and Hurricane Sally. Thunderstorms occur throughout the summer, but are most severe in the spring and fall, when destructive winds and tornadoes occasionally occur.

The late winter occasionally brings very small sleet/snow showers, with a significant snow storm happening rarely. Deep winter is occasionally accompanied by a tornado touching down in the county. The last deep-winter tornado touched down in the county on Christmas Day, 2012. The last two big snow events to affect Troy were part of the 2010 Southern Snow event and 1993 Storm of the Century.

Former mayor Jimmy C. Lunsford was elected to his first term in 1985. He won re-election each year since, until his retirement in 2012, and is the longest-serving mayor in Troy history.

About 5 miles north of Troy is the Troy Municipal Airport, which can accommodate general aviation, but not commercial flights.

Troy is about 2.5 hours north by highway from the major Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport, and about 3 hours southwest by highway from the major Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

The airport was originally opened in 1942 during World War II as an auxiliary air field to Maxwell Air Force Base in nearby Montgomery. The air field has since been designated as a general-aviation airport. The tower and radar facilities are currently run by U.S. Army air traffic controllers. The airport allows for private jets to fly in, and is dominated by student pilots flying TH-67 helicopters from nearby Fort Novosel.

Wedowee, which means &quot;old water&quot; in the Creek language, was named after a Muscogee Creek Indian chief. This area was historically occupied by the Muscogee Creek people.

Following Indian Removal of the Creek in the 1830s to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River by the US government, this area was settled by European Americans. The town of Wedowee was designated as the county seat of Randolph County in 1835. The county was developed for the cultivation of cotton as a commodity crop, with labor primarily done by enslaved African Americans, many of whom had been sold to the Deep South from the Upper South in the domestic slave trade.

Since the late 20th century, Lake Wedowee was created by the impoundment of the Tallapoosa River. This has enhanced the tourist drawing power of the town. Also known as the R. L. Harris Reservoir, the lake draws thousands of visitors to Wedowee every year.

==History==
George L. Scott Sr., an Alabaster pioneer, owned and operated Alabaster Lime Co., which mined this mineral. His shipping point was known as “Scott Rock.” Later, worker housing was built to accommodate some of the mine employees. The community was named Alabaster after the &quot;white calcium carbonate mineral.&quot;

The First Bank of Alabaster opened in 1952, and its president was George L. Scott Jr., who later was elected as the first mayor of Alabaster. The first attempt in 1952 to incorporate Alabaster failed. In January 1953, the petition was again filed, and on February 23, 1953, Alabaster was officially incorporated, with a favorable vote of 79 to 23, and 427 residing inhabitants. In 1955, the Alabaster Water and Gas Board was formed.

==History==
Successive indigenous peoples had lived in the area for thousands of years. In the 16th century, people identified as part of the Kymulga-phase culture (of the larger Mississippian culture) lived at Talisi, the former site of Childersburg. In the fall of 1540, the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto&#x27;s expedition rested here for about one month during its exploration of the Southeast. Childersburg is the &quot;oldest occupied settlement in America” The Abihka people (part of those who became known as the Muskogee or Creek) dominated the area by the 18th century.

The Alabama Army Ammunition Plant, a munitions plant, was established in Childersburg in 1941 and operated throughout World War II until August 1945. Operated by DuPont, the plant produced explosives, such as nitrocellulose, trinitrotoluene (TNT), and dinitrotoluene (DNT). The plant also secretly produced heavy water to support the Manhattan Project. In 1940 the town had about five hundred people. Over fourteen thousand workers came to build and later operate the new facility.

<text>Columbiana is a city and the county seat of Shelby County, Alabama, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 4,462.

==History==
Columbiana, originally called Columbia, was selected as the county seat of Shelby County in 1826 over rivals Calera and Montevallo. After the selection as the county seat, Columbiana celebrated by drilling holes in a large pine tree and packing it with gunpowder. The tree was blown up and the sound could be heard for miles. Later in 1826, the courthouse was moved to an old school building in Columbiana.

An act of the Alabama Legislature officially changed the name of Shelby County&#x27;s county seat to Columbiana on January 13, 1832. Columbiana was incorporated on December 5, 1837, with corporate limits one-quarter of a mile in each direction from the public square.

In 1854, the decision was made to build a larger courthouse at the south end of “Silk Stocking Road”, now Main Street. From 1854 to 1908 several additions and changes were made to the courthouse. During the American Civil War, Columbiana was connected to the nearby town of Shelby by the Shelby Iron Company Railroad, which connected the Shelby Iron Works to the Alabama and Tennessee River Railroad. The Iron Works supplied iron to the C.B. Churchill and Company foundry, which moved to Columbiana in 1862 after the fall of Corinth, Mississippi. The Churchill foundry made eight and ten pound shot, eight and ten pound shells, and shells for Blakely rifles. The C.B. Churchill and Company foundry, Shelby Iron Works and the railroad were destroyed by Union forces on March 31, 1865, as part of Wilson&#x27;s Raid.

Moving the courthouse to Columbiana was not necessarily popular in 1826 and there have been numerous attempts to relocate the county seat over the years. In 1901, the Alabama Constitutional Convention addressed the issue by including Section 41 in the new state constitution. Section 41 prohibited a move of the Shelby County seat from Columbiana unless a vote of the people was held, the only county in Alabama with such a designation.

To further solidify Columbiana&#x27;s claim to the county seat, in 1905 construction began two blocks north of the existing courthouse on a new marble courthouse at a cost of $300,000. The new courthouse was completed in 1908 and has been renovated and enlarged on a number of occasions. The new courthouse has served Shelby County for over 100 years.

The “Old Courthouse” is now home to the Shelby County Museum and Archives.

Today, Columbiana is home to the Shelby County Board of Education, the Shelby County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, the Shelby County Jail, and Harrison Regional Library, which is the main office for the Shelby County Library System. Columbiana holds the annual Liberty Day celebration on the last weekend in June, which was first held in 1986 to honor the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty. The current mayor is David Mitchell.

The population of Columbiana was 4,546 as of 2021.

==Government==
The mayor is Theoangelo Perkins. The previous mayor was Don Greene, and the two have traded this position back and forth for many election cycles.

Mayor Theoangelo Perkins was the mayor in 2012. Also in 2012, the international scandal of the traffic court investigation into the high fines, prison sentences for traffic violations, and large fees to a non- public third-party probation company was widely reported from local news agencies to the United Kingdom in the Guardian.

Shelby County judge called the Harpersville Traffic Court “judicially sanctioned extortion racket.” (https://eji.org/files/mi-mgm-alabama-city-running-exortion-racket-07-16-12.pdf;

https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/14/us/judge-in-alabama-halts-private-probation.html?smid=pl-share)

Mayor Theoangelo Perkins was also the mayor of Harpersville when Shelby County Sheriff&#x27;s Department acted on an order to seize the town&#x27;s records before the documents could be removed or destroyed. The Mayor was not available for comment according to the Shelby County Reporter; “Harpersville Mayor Theoangelo Perkins did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment.” (https://www.shelbycountyreporter.com/2012/08/10/sheriffs-deputies-seizing-records-in-harpersville-city-court-case/)

The Harpersville Clerk of the Court in a recorded deposition which was reported in an article in The Nation said, “In testimony offered at a deposition, Hall, the court clerk, acknowledged that the sentences Harpersville debtors served at the Shelby County Work Release Center were indefinite. Ford’s sentence, Hall explained, was “up to her”; she could leave as soon as she paid off her fines. The sole function of work release was to collect outstanding debt, forgoing the rehabilitative underpinning of most work-release programs.” https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/town-turned-poverty-prison-sentence/)

The article also listed that two people died while in custody waiting to pay off their debt to the Harpersville Traffic Court.

<text>Leavenworth () is the county seat and largest city of Leavenworth County, Kansas, United States. Part of the Kansas City metropolitan area, Leavenworth is located on the west bank of the Missouri River, on the site of Fort Leavenworth, built in 1827. The city became known in American history for its role as a key supply base in the settlement of the American West. During the Civil War, many volunteers joined the Union Army from Leavenworth. The city has been notable as the location of several prisons, particularly the United States Disciplinary Barracks and United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 37,351.

==History==
Leavenworth, founded in 1854, was the first city incorporated in the territory of Kansas. The city developed south of Fort Leavenworth, which was established as Cantonment Leavenworth in 1827 by Colonel Henry Leavenworth. Its location on the Missouri River attracted refugee African-American slaves in the antebellum years, who were seeking freedom from the slave state of Missouri across the river. Abolition supporters helped them find refuge. In the years before the Civil War, Leavenworth was a hotbed of anti-slavery and pro-slavery agitation, often leading to open physical confrontations on the street and in public meetings.

On April 3, 1858, the &quot;Leavenworth Constitution&quot; for the state of Kansas was adopted here. Although the federal government never approved this early version of the state constitution, it was considered one of the most radical of the four constitutions drafted for the new territory because it recognized freed black people as citizens.

Refugee African Americans continued to settle in the city during the war. By 1865, it had attracted nearly one-fifth of the 12,000 black people in the state. In 1866, the 10th Regiment of Cavalry, an all-black unit within the U.S. Army, was stood up at Fort Leavenworth. Charles Henry Langston was an African-American leader from Boston who worked and lived in Leavenworth and northeastern Kansas in the Reconstruction era and afterward. In Kansas, Langston worked for black suffrage and the right of African Americans to sit on juries, testify in court, and have their children educated in common schools. African Americans gained suffrage in 1870 after passage of the federal 15th constitutional amendment, and the legislature voted for their right to sit on juries in 1874.

African Americans continued to migrate to the state of Kansas after the war. There were a total of 17,108 African Americans in Kansas in 1870, with 43,107 in 1880, and 52,003 by 1900, most of whom lived in urban areas.

===20th century to present===
Fred Alexander, a 22-year-old black veteran of the Spanish–American War, was arrested on circumstantial evidence following months of assaults on young white women in late 1900. Witnesses had identified a &quot;large white man&quot; and a &quot;slight black man&quot; as having been seen in the vicinity of the attacks, Police moved him to the penitentiary during questioning, but a lynch mob was forming in Leavenworth. The sheriff needed to bring him to Leavenworth for arraignment at the county court. He refused the governor&#x27;s offer of state militia, and was unable to protect the prisoner. On January 15, 1901, Alexander was taken from jail by a mob of 5,000 people and to the site of the murder of Pearl Forbes, where he was brutally lynched: burned alive. He protested his innocence to the end. An inquest concluded he had been killed by &quot;persons unknown&quot;.

His family refused to claim his body for burial. His father Alfred Alexander, an exoduster, said &quot;The people have mutilated him, now let them bury him.&quot; The city arranged burial. African Americans in the region were horrified at Alexander&#x27;s murder by the mob and created the first state chapter of the Afro-American Council, then the only national organization working for civil rights. (The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was founded a few years later, and absorbed most members of the AAC.)

In 1972 Benjamin Day became the city&#x27;s first African-American mayor. Day had been elected to the City Commission one year earlier. Leavenworth appoints its mayor from among the members of the Commission, and Day was named mayor in 1971. Day was a former educator and principal in Leavenworth.

Fort Leavenworth was located outside the city limits until its territory was annexed by the city on April 12, 1977.

In 2008, an underground series of &quot;vaults&quot; was found in the city, apparently built during the late 19th century.

<text>Georges Duby (; 7 October 1919 – 3 December 1996) was a French historian who specialised in the social and economic history of the Middle Ages. He ranks among the most influential medieval historians of the twentieth century and was one of France&#x27;s most prominent public intellectuals from the 1970s to his death. In 2019, his work was published in the &quot;Bibliothèque de la Pléiade&quot;. He is one of the rare historians to benefit from such an honor, with Herodotus, Thucydides, Ibn Khaldoun, Froissart and Michelet.

== Early life and education ==

Born in Paris to a family of craftsmen of Burgundian and Alsacian origin, Duby was initially educated in the field of historical geography before he moved into history. He earned an undergraduate degree at Lyon in 1942 and completed his graduate thesis at the Sorbonne under Charles-Edmond Perrin in 1952.

== Career ==

He taught first at Besançon and then at the University of Aix-en-Provence before he was appointed in 1970 to the Chair of the History of Medieval Society in the Collège de France. He remained attached to the Collège until his retirement in 1991. He was elected to the Académie française in 1987.

==Medieval history==

Although Duby authored dozens of books, articles and reviews during his prolific career—for academic as well as popular audiences—his reputation and legacy as a scholar will always be attached to his first monograph, a published version of his 1952 doctoral thesis entitled &quot;La société aux XIe et XIIe siècles dans la région mâconnaise&quot; (&quot;Society in the 11th and 12th centuries in the Mâconnais region&quot;). &quot;La société&quot; exerted a profound influence on medieval scholarship in the second half of the twentieth century, placing the study of medieval feudal society on an entirely new footing. Working from the extensive documentary sources surviving from the Burgundian monastery of Cluny, as well as the dioceses of Mâcon and Dijon, Duby excavated the complex social and economic relationships among the individuals and institutions of the Mâconnais region, charting a profound shift in the social structures of medieval society around the year 1000.

Duby argued that in early eleventh century, governing institutions—particularly comital courts established under the Carolingian monarchy—that had represented public justice and order in Burgundy during the ninth and tenth centuries receded and gave way to a new feudal order wherein independent aristocratic knights wielded power over peasant communities through strong-arm tactics and threats of violence. The emergence of this new, decentralized society of dynastic lords could then explain such later eleventh-century phenomena as the Peace of God, the Gregorian reform movement and the Crusades.

Following upon this, Duby formulated a famous theory about the Crusades: that the tremendous response to the idea of Holy War against the Muslims can be traced to the desire of &quot;iuvenes&quot;, knights, mostly young and with little prospect of becoming lords, to make their fortunes by venturing abroad and seeking fame in the Levant. While Duby&#x27;s theory had long-lasting influence, later scholars such as Jonathan Riley-Smith argued against it, arguing that there was no large-scale shortage of land in Western Europe at the time, that knights actually lost money going on crusade, and that lay religious sentiment was their primary motivation. Not all modern scholars follow Riley-Smith in this regard.

Duby&#x27;s intensive and rigorous examination of a local society based on archival sources and a broad understanding of the social, environmental and economic bases of daily life became a standard model for medieval historical research in France for decades after the appearance of &quot;La société&quot;. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, French doctoral students investigated their own corners of medieval France, Italy and Spain in a similar way, hoping to compare and contrast their own results with those of Duby&#x27;s Mâconnais and its thesis about the transformation of European society at the end of the first millennium.

Although he was never formally a student in the circle of scholars around Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre that came to be known as the Annales School, Duby was in many ways the most visible exponent of the &quot;Annaliste&quot; tradition, emphasizing the need to place people and their daily lives at the center of historical inquiry.

== History of mentalities ==
Duby was also a pioneer in what he and other &quot;Annaliste&quot; historians in the 1970s and 80s came to call the &quot;history of mentalities&quot;, or the study of not just what people did, but their value systems and how they imagined their world. In books like &quot;The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined&quot; and &quot;The Age of Cathedrals&quot;, Duby showed how ideals and social reality existed in dynamic relationship to one another. His distilled biographical essay on William Marshal set the knight&#x27;s career in the context of feudal loyalties, honour and the chivalric frame of mind.

Duby&#x27;s interest in the idea of historical &quot;mentalities&quot; extended to thinking about the position of contemporary society vis-a-vis its past. In &quot;Le Dimanche de Bouvines&quot; (1973) on the pivotal 1214 battle of Bouvines, Duby chose not to analyze the battle itself, but the ways it had been represented and remembered over time and the role its memory had played in the formation of French ideas about its medieval past. The book remains a classic of &quot;Annales&quot;-style historiography, eschewing the &quot;great man&quot; and event-oriented theories of political history in favor of asking questions about the evolution of historical perceptions and ideas over the long term, the &quot;longue durée&quot;. Duby also wrote frequently in newspapers and popular journals and was a regular guest on radio and television programs promoting historical awareness and support for the arts and social sciences in France. He served as the first director of Société d&#x27;édition de programmes de télévision (aka La Sept), a French broadcast network dedicated to educational programming.

His last book, &quot;L&#x27;histoire continue&quot; (&quot;History Continues&quot;) (1991; Engl. trans. 1994), is an intellectual autobiography. In it, Duby stresses the importance of the historian as a public figure who can make the past relevant and exciting to those in the present. &#x27;Make no mistake: the first function of historical literature had always been to entertain.&#x27;

<doc id="105119" wikidata="Q79549" url="?curid=105119" title="Montevallo, Alabama">
<text>Montevallo is a city in Shelby County, Alabama, United States. A college town, it is the home of the University of Montevallo, a public liberal arts university with approximately 3,000 students. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city of Montevallo is 7,229.

==Geography==
Montevallo is located at (33.1049, -86.8628). A plaque on Reynolds Cemetery Road, just off Alabama State Route 25, in the eastern corner of the town, marks the geographic center of the state of Alabama. Middle Street, formerly known as Main Street, had its name changed in 1899 for this reason, upon the completion of a new state survey.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.66%) is water.

==History==

The area where Montevallo is now was controlled by the Creek Indians. After being acquired in 1814 Jesse Wilson claimed a small hill on the northern bank of Wilson&#x27;s Creek by the present Montevallo City Cemetery and created a homestead there, making it the oldest settlement in Shelby County. Wilson&#x27;s friends and family followed afterwards and also settled in the area, and a settlement known as Wilson&#x27;s Hill developed on the site. The settlement&#x27;s location at almost the exact center of Alabama meant it was considered one of the potential sites for the University of Alabama. In an attempt to encourage the university to choose the site the settlement changed its name to Montevallo, which is Italian for &quot;the hill in the valley&quot;.

Montevallo was used by local farmers as a market town where they could sell and package their produce. It was incorporated as a city in 1848. In 1853 a railway was built between Montevallo and Selma which allowed further economic growth to Montevallo and in 1856 a coal mine was created nearby leading to further growth.

During the American Civil War, Union troops under the command of James H. Wilson camped in Montevallo in the spring of 1865 and skirmished with Confederates near the railroad depot. After the war, commercial life and growth was dominated by the coal mine owned by Truman Aldrich who leased the mine and attempted to increase production in response to the growing iron industry in the region and the growing city of Birmingham. Starting in 1890, company owned worker housing was built in Montevallo to house miners.
In the early 1890s, residents of Montevallo entered the city in a competition to be selected for the site of the Alabama Girl&#x27;s Industrial School (later the University of Montevallo) a technical college for white women, raising funds to purchase land and antebellum buildings for the college they won and the college was founded in Montevallo in 1896. Commerce and economic growth increased in Montevallo after the establishment of the college, which was renamed Alabama College in 1919, started admitting men in 1956 and started admitting African Americans in 1968 and became the modern liberal arts University of Montevallo. The university became the main source of commerce in Montevallo and money generated by it was used by the municipal government to build schools. The university also allowed the community some stability during the Great Depression. It quickly took over the coal mine as the major employer in Montevallo, the coal mine closing in 1946.

==Places of interest==
===Parnell Memorial Library===

The Montevallo Public Library was founded in March 1958 under the leadership of the City of Montevallo and the Montevallo Branch of the American Association of University Women. The library began modestly as a collection of several hundred books in a small room at City Hall. The first librarian was Lillian Ward.

In 1974 the public library was moved to the Depot-in-the-Park, where Mayme Yarbrough was the librarian. It remained there until a 1978 fire destroyed the building and all its contents. The library was relocated to the City Hall Annex until 1984. At that time, the library was moved to the renovated telephone company switching building. The renovation of the building was made possible through the efforts of many people in this community and beyond. From March 1984 until December 2006, that facility served as Montevallo&#x27;s public library.

In response to the offer from Dr. L. C. Parnell, Jr., to house his Civil War collection in the existing library at 845 Valley Street if an expansion of the library were undertaken, Parnell Memorial Library Foundation was incorporated on March 23, 1998. The mission of the Foundation is to promote funding for expansion of the facilities, services, and programs of Parnell Memorial Library.

As community needs grew, and particularly as community arts programming expanded, it was apparent that Montevallo needed a facility that was more than a traditional library. One of the primary agents of community arts programming is the Montevallo Main Street Players. The community theater group began more than thirty years ago and has performed in various city locations, including the Depot-in-the-Park and the City recreational building. For years, members of the Montevallo Main Street Players have needed a theater, complete with an up-to-date lighting and sound system, that they can use consistently for producing plays and storing props.

In June 2001, representatives from the Foundation, the Montevallo Library Board, the Library Staff, the Montevallo Main Street Players, and the City of Montevallo agreed that the community needed a new library in a new location to meet diverse community needs and to house the Parnell Collection of historical books and documents. The group requested that the City locate property suitable for building a new library that would also serve as a community cultural center. Groundbreaking took place on November 1, 2004, and the Grand Opening was held February 25, 2007.

The new library includes an art gallery and a quality theater used by the Montevallo Main Street Players, the public schools, and other area groups. Along with the large meeting room, the theatre is a much-needed venue for productions by touring theatre companies and musical groups as well as for City of Montevallo meetings and other civic gatherings.

===Shoal Creek Park===
Shoal Creek Park is a historical 167-acre estate that provides a series of walking and biking trails, in addition to a Pavilion, Antebellum style house, known as Perry Hall, and parking lot, located on Highway 119 in Montevallo surrounding Shoal Creek.

Perry Hall was constructed in 1834 on an 800-acre farm owned by the Perry family. The ownership of the house and land were later transferred to the Mahler family in 1946, and later donated to the city of Montevallo in 2013 by Ms. Elizabeth “Betty” Mahler.

===Orr Park===
Orr Park, located in Montevallo along Shoal Creek offers residents and visitors a natural recreational environment. Orr Park offers two playgrounds, six baseball/softball fields, a walking trail, a football field and a practice field.

Orr Park contains a local attraction dubbed &quot;Tinglewood&quot;. In the early 1990s, local artist Tim Tingle, a coal miner by trade, took it upon himself to transform storm-damaged cedar trees into works of art. The carvings feature gnomes, a dragon, and a fish eating a snake, among others.

===American Village===
The American Village is a classroom and American history and civics education center. The American Village serves the Nation as an educational institution whose mission is to strengthen and renew the foundations of American liberty and self-government by engaging and inspiring citizens and leaders, with a special emphasis on programs for young people.

==Sister city==
The friendly relationship between Echizen Town and Montevallo began in 1995 with a common interest in pottery. Echizen Town is well known for its unusual pottery and the University of Montevallo excels in teaching and creating the art. Echizen Town is also well known in Japan for its high quality crab, rice, and daffodils. Many people often confuse Echizen Town with Echizen City, a larger city to the south of Echizen Town, known for its production of knives and paper.

<text>Ashville is a city in and one of the county seats of St. Clair County, Alabama, United States, other seat being Pell City. Its population was 2,212 at the 2010 census, down from 2,260, at which time it was a town. It incorporated in 1822.

==History==
Ashville was initially founded as the community of St. Clairsville, but the name was changed to honor John Ash, the first white settler of the area who arrived in 1817. He became the first county judge and later state senator. His log cabin stands in the city center. Philip Coleman originally owned the land on which the town stands, but he sold 30 acres to the five county commissioners, which included Ash, who was appointed by Gov. Thomas Bibb to establish a new county seat for St. Clair. It was designated the county seat in 1821 and the village incorporated in 1822. The first courthouse, also a log structure, was built two years later. It was replaced in 1844 with the current courthouse building.

In 1890, a group of investors organized the Tennessee River, Ashville and Coosa Railroad Company, and planned to build a railroad line from Sheffield to Anniston via Ashville. It managed to build to Ashville from Whitney, connecting the town to the Alabama Great Southern Railroad. However, it went bankrupt during the mid-1890s, and the tracks were dismantled and sold for scrap.

Electric lights came to Ashville in 1891, and the first telephone company was chartered in the same year. Residents in the southern half of the county often complained of the difficulty of traveling to Ashville over Backbone Mountain, which divides the county, so the state legislature authorized a satellite county seat to be established in Pell City in 1907 on the southern side of the mountain.

On the evening of April 27, 2011, an EF-4 tornado ripped through the Shoal Creek Valley community south of Ashville, killing 13 people. The tornado also destroyed hundreds of thousands of dollars&#x27; worth of property including homes, livestock, timberland, and farm equipment. Rescuers from neighboring communities immediately responded after the twister swept through the valley; however, due to the abundance of fallen timber blocking the roads and the remoteness of the community, many victims were forced to wait hours before aid could arrive. Following the devastation, then-Governor Robert Bentley visited the community along with officials from the Alabama Emergency Management Agency and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The community received both federal and state disaster aid for several weeks following the destructive tornado.

<text>Pell City is a city in and one of the county seats of St. Clair County, Alabama, United States, the other seat being Ashville. At the 2020 census, the population was 12,939. At the 2010 census, the city-limit population jumped to 12,695.

It was home to Avondale Mills and its legacy in the Avondale Mill Historic District.

== History ==

Railroad investors founded Pell City in 1890 and named it after George Pell of the Pell City Iron and Land Company, one of its financial backers. The city was incorporated on May 6, 1891, but nearly failed during the Panic of 1893.

Pell City was revived in 1902 when Sumter Cogswell built the Pell City Manufacturing Company, which subsequently became Avondale Mills, a major landmark of the town until Thunder Enterprises, a Tennessee company, bought the building and began dismantling the factory in 2008. On February 14, 2008, a fire started at the mill. The fire was so large it could be seen from the Chula Vista/ Springville exit on Interstate 20 (I20). The water tower remains, but the smoke stack was destroyed by workers after cracking in the cement made it a hazard.

The mill was the economic and social center of the town during its development and early growth. Besides the textile mill, other economic endeavors included agriculture and mercantile establishments. Large cotton, soybean, and cattle farms were located in the area. Pell City increased its size in 1956 when the nearby towns of Eden and Oak Ridge were merged with the city. The first mayor was Green Evans.

The residences of Sumter Cogswell and Green Evans (Pell City&#x27;s first mayor) are two of the earliest structures, dating from the late nineteenth century. The majority of the historic structures date from 1902 to 1905.

Ashville, Alabama, in the northern part of St. Clair County was the county seat from 1821 to 1907. A constitutional amendment in 1907 established Pell City as the second county seat, and for many years St. Clair County was the only county in the country with two full-service county seats. Both county seats remain operational to this day although Pell City has far surpassed Ashville in growth in large part due to I-20 and Logan Martin Lake. The construction of Logan Martin Dam in 1964 created the lake and a large recreational area, which brought new businesses, temporary summer residents and tourists, and hundreds of new permanent residents building new homes along the new lake.

On April 8, 1998, an F2 tornado struck north of the city limits after the F5 tornado expired in western Jefferson County. This windstorm killed two people in a mobile home. It remained for , partially damaging a church, twenty-six homes and mobile homes, and other buildings in Coal City. Ninety other homes and mobile homes suffered minor to major destruction. An additional twelve people were injured. The twister damaged a funeral home and twenty-five homes. The Bethel Baptist Church in Odenville was destroyed a few minutes after its members left an Easter pageant rehearsal that had been cancelled because of the storm.

In 2006 Avondale Mills ceased operations. Two years later, in February 2008, Avondale Mills burned down in an accidental fire. At the time, Thunder Enterprises, a Tennessee firm, had completed almost half of the work in dismantling the building for materials. No employees were harmed in the fire.

In November 2015, Pell City made global news when a video of the Avondale Mills smokestack went viral on the internet. During a demolition of the smokestack, the 133-year-old structure collapsed on top of construction worker, Tim Philfer. Luckily, Philfer walked away unharmed from this accident.

==Government==
In 2012, having surpassed a population of 12,000 residents, Pell City became only the 14th municipality in Alabama to change its form of government to a Council-Manager form of government. Under this form of government, the city council appoints a City Manager who then oversees the day-to-day operations of the city. While the mayor&#x27;s position does not have a vote on matters that come before the council, the mayor may use his discretion to veto certain items. The current City Manager is Brian Muenger, who served in the same capacity for City of Talladega, Alabama.

==Development==
In 2015, Pell City residents were given the opportunity to vote on the legalization of Sunday alcohol sales. A study commissioned by the City of Pell City projected a $6.8 million economic impact if the referendum passed. On August 11, citizens voted 74% in favor of the referendum. On August 23, businesses were allowed to begin selling alcohol on Sundays for the first time. Likely due to the passage of this referendum, several corporate entities immediately entered into negotiations to open new restaurants and sports bars within the city. Buffalo Wild Wings announced its intention to build a brand new restaurant in late 2015. Construction and training were completed in October 2016, and the restaurant opened on November 7, 2016.

The city announced in June 2016 that it had entered into an agreement with Premiere Cinemas to develop a new 40,000 sq ft entertainment center which would include seven movie screens, a 10-lane bowling alley, a cafe, arcade and event rooms. The complex opened to the public on January 17, 2019.

==Healthcare==
Located in Pell City is the Colonel Robert L. Howard State Veterans Home, a nursing home and long-term care facility serving the entire county. The veterans home is a 280-bed facility built in a neighborhood-style of several small cottage clusters, instead of one large institution. The veterans home is named for Alabama native and Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Robert L. Howard.

The St. Vincent&#x27;s St. Clair hospital, operated by the St. Vincent&#x27;s Health System, serves the entire county, but is located solely within the city limits. It replaced an aging facility, formerly known as St. Clair Regional Hospital.

==Education==
After a period of growth in the 1980s, Pell City voted to split its school system off from the county system, becoming independent. The system has over 4500 students spread across Pell City High School, Duran Junior High School, Duran South, Iola Roberts Elementary, Walter M. Kennedy Elementary, Coosa Valley Elementary, Eden Elementary, and Williams Intermediate School.
The system also operates a trade school as an alternative to college preparation courses.

A conversion of Duran South into a dedicated pre-k school was discussed by the school board in 2019. Seventh and eighth grades would be combined into one school, with Pell City High School being remodeled. These proposals were accepted by the school board.

In 2005 Jefferson State Community College opened a new campus location in Pell City offering a wide variety of community college courses. The school announced in 2009 that it will begin offering nursing programs to support the recently confirmed Veterans Nursing Home and St. Vincent&#x27;s St. Clair Hospital.

In 2011, two of the city&#x27;s schools, Iola Roberts Elementary and Pell City High School, began the year after undergoing extensive renovations and/or expansions to their campuses.

In November 2021 the Pell City School System passed its a property tax referendum, which included full-time art and music teachers for all elementary schools, storm shelters at Eden Elementary School and Coosa Valley Elementary School, a complete renovation of Pell City High School along with a new cafeteria and band hall, a new multi-purpose building to Duran North, and various improvements and upgrades to sports facilities.

== Media ==
Pell City, and all of St. Clair County, is located in Birmingham&#x27;s designated market area for local news and weather coverage. The city has one dedicated FM radio station, WFHK.

Pell City is served by two daily and two weekly newspapers. The &quot;Birmingham News&quot; serves the county, and &quot;The Daily Home&quot;, which also represents Talladega County, maintains an office in the city. The weekly &quot;St. Clair News-Aegis&quot; and &quot;St Clair Times&quot; offer more local coverage. The latter is an offshoot of &quot;The Daily Home&quot;.

<text>Cuba is a town in Sumter County, Alabama, United States. At the 2020 census the population was 306, down from 346 in 2010.

==History==

The Cuba post office existed prior to 1850, with nothing in the present-day area of the town of Cuba but wilderness. The first people to live in this site were a slaveowner named Mr. R.A. Clay, who moved from Autauga County with his family and approximately 100 slaves in 1852, and purchased all the land which later made up the town of Cuba. By 1861, the town was a thriving farming industry and had a sizable truck-crop enterprise. Also during this time, the Northeast and Southwest Railroad (later the Alabama Great Southern Railroad, Southern Railway and now Norfolk Southern) was being built. Clay donated land for the railroad right-of-way, built mainly by the people he enslaved. As the town was settled, the post office became known as Cuba Station. The Town of Cuba was incorporated in 1890 with Dr. A.L. Vaughan as its first mayor.

In 1870, Mr. Clay sold to Mr. Warner Lewis half of the town and divided it into lots, with two set aside for the building of the Baptist and Methodist churches. Cuba Baptist Church was organized in 1879; the original building still stands on the spot where it was first built. The Methodist Church was organized about 1884. This church membership dissolved many years ago. The Holiness Church was organized about 1886, the Presbyterian Church about 1906, and the Independent Holiness Church about 1925.

Mrs. Curtis Vaughan was the first person to be buried in Cuba, in 1888. Mr. R.A. Clay, the morning after her death, donated the land for the Cuba Cemetery, which later became Clay Memorial Cemetery in his honor.

==Chemical Waste Management landfill==

Emelle is home to the largest hazardous waste landfill in the United States, called the “Cadillac of Landfills”, owned by Chemical Waste Management, Inc. This town of just a few dozen, mostly minority, residents, became a center for controversy on environmental racism. In 1978, Chemical Waste Management purchased a landfill permit of approximately 4 miles to the north of Emelle. In Sumter County, one-third of the residents live below poverty level. The majority of the residents near the landfill are Black. The landfill has become the largest hazardous waste landfill in the United States and among the top in the world holding 5 or 6 million tons of hazardous waste. Most of the waste disposed of in the United States, due to the Superfund removal program, ended up at the landfill between 1984 and 1987. It is on top of the Eutaw Aquifer, which supplies water to a large part of Alabama.

Key actors in this struggle were Chemical Waste Management, regulatory agencies, and Alabamians for a Clean Environment. Chemical Waste Management is the largest company in the hazardous waste industry, as it serves to more than 10 million residential customers and 1 million businesses. Currently, the company is working on defining an environmental image by participating in many recycling projects. Regulatory agencies are groups responsible for environmental protection that want to establish facilities that can handle the nation&#x27;s waste safely. Examples include the Alabama Department of Environmental Management and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Alabamians for a Clean Environment (ACE) is a grassroots environmental group who wants to close down Chemical Waste Management. White women (such as Kaye Kiker) and their husbands formed the group.

Residents and other concerned citizens held a demonstration in Emelle against the Chemical Waste landfill. This demonstration was based on the struggle in Warren County, North Carolina, where the idea of environmental racism and the need for environmental justice emerged. The Emelle demonstration marked the first time that blacks and whites in Sumter County joined together in a public protest over any political issue. Alabamians for a Clean Environment used techniques such as sign waving and name calling to draw attention to their cause. They also had access to the media and Attorney General Jimmy Evans, who became a powerful actor in their cause. Soon they attracted national attention and gained support from larger partisan organizations such as the National Toxics Fund Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes, the National Toxics Fund Campaign, the Sierra Club and Greenpeace. They did not achieve their goal of shutting down Chemical Waste Management.

===Economic background===

Emelle is located in the Black Belt region in Alabama. During the Civil War, this city played a large role in Alabama’s cotton plantation economy and about half of the residents were slaves. Cotton production kept the Black population in poverty and continued their dependence on the white man. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 brought changes to Emelle, and Blacks were elected to public office in 1978. Soon the economy began to change as government and business elites were the main people affecting land-use decisions. A general theme arose of polluting industries coming into poor minority communities where local community leaders had no input. The environmental risks were traded for jobs. Key local leaders supported Chemical Waste Management, as the counties budgets were increased $5.00 for every ton of waste buried in the county. Once up and running, the dump has had many problems such as on-site fires, water contamination, environmental violations, dumping without permits, and unauthorized acceptance of dioxins.

<text>Epes is a town in Sumter County, Alabama, United States. Initially called Epes Station, it was incorporated as Epes in 1899. At the 2010 census the population was 192, down from 206 in 2000.

==Geography==
Epes is located near Jones Bluff, overlooking the Tombigbee River. It is located at (32.690497, -88.124182). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==History==
===18th century===

Epes has its origins in Fort de Tombecbé (Fort Tombecbe), one of the major fortifications built under Louis XIV of France, in what is now the American south, in the early eighteenth century. In January 1736, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, governor of Louisiana, recruited a Swiss officer serving with the French, Joseph Christophe de Lusser, to construct a fort on the Tombigbee River, &quot;atop an 80-foot bluff to support his campaign against the Chickasaws&quot; that was to proceed in the year following; Bienville visited the site in April of the same year, and took control of the construction, leading to its completion and its support of his martial efforts against the Native Americans. After a 26-year stay, during which the French used this and other holdings to check &quot;westward expansion by the British into the French colony of Louisiana,&quot; and to serve &quot;as a trading post, solidifying France&#x27;s relations with the Choctaws... the most powerful French ally in the area,&quot; the French ceded the fort, with most of its North American territory, to Great Britain under the Treaty of Paris, surrendering Tombecbé in November 1763; the British inspected and renamed it Fort York, although its actual inhabitation would await a recurrence of hostilities between the Choctaw and Creek Indians in 1766. Records of those overseeing the fort in this period document the challenge of supplying such a remote location, and after a 1768 truce ended the hostilities between the Choctaw and Creeks, the British abandoned Fort York, with Choctaws being the remaining inhabitants of the area until this tribe ceded a small parcel of land that included the fort to the Spanish in 1792/1793, under the Treaty of Boucfouca. As little of the original fortification structures remained when Spain arrived to take control in 1794, the Spanish chose to construct &quot;a smaller but more substantial earthen structure&quot; (rather than building further wooden fortifications); they renamed the site and their resulting structure Fort Confederacion, in recognition of the alliance the Spanish had struck with Native American groups to assist them in resisting encroachment by commerce and settlements from the United States. Fortifications were completed before the beginning of 1796, in time to provide support to the Spanish when war broke out with the United States, and when hostilities began again between the Chickasaw and Creek Indians; the Treaty of San Lorenzo, between Spain and the young U.S., ended that part of the hostilities, and ceded Spanish territory &quot;above the 31st parallel,&quot; including the Fort, to the U.S, &quot;thus marking the end of the European colonial era in Alabama.&quot;

===19th and 20th centuries===

Epes was incorporated in 1899 and named for Dr. John W. Epes, who donated the right-of-way for Southern Railroad (if the town would be named Epes). The town is located on the high bluffs of the Tombigbee River. Standing on the bluffs, you could hear the ferries and steamboats traveling down river. During its prime, it was known as the transportation and business and service center. It had three cotton gins, a cotton compress, cotton seed oil mill, creamery, handle company, The Casey Hotel, The Bowers Boarding House, a school, two grocery stores, a drug store, general merchandising stores, and two livery stables. The second stockyard in Alabama opened in Epes in 1936.

==History==
The area now known as Livingston was part of the traditional territory of the nation of Choctaw Indians until the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1830. The federal government removed most of the Choctaw to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma. At that time, settlers from the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginia established the first European-American community about two blocks from the current Courthouse Square, near the corner of Madison and Spring Streets.

In 1833, a commission was formed to organize Sumter County. Livingston was named after a well-known statesman and jurist of the day, Edward Livingston. Livingston was chosen as the county seat. Soon followed the first newspaper, &quot;The Voice of Sumter&quot;; four schools (including Livingston Female Academy, now The University of West Alabama), the courthouse, and the Bored Well.

The first courthouse was built of logs. It was replaced by a frame courthouse in 1839, which burned in 1901. The Probate Judge&#x27;s office, built at the same time, survived the fire. It now houses the county commission office.

In the latter part of the nineteenth century, Livingston became widely known as a health spa because of the water from its Bored Well, one of many that made extensive settlement possible in the Black Belt. This well was bored by an old blind mule which pulled an auger around until an artesian aquifer was reached in 1857. Promoters built a Chinese-styled pagoda over the well. In 1924 the pagoda was replaced by the predecessor to the present pavilion.

During the early part of the twentieth century, Livingston continued to be known as a health resort. It was also the site of the Alabama Normal School, which developed from the Livingston Female Academy and was established to train teachers for the public school system founded during the Reconstruction era. Reflecting its expanding programs and level of curriculum, the name of the college was later changed to the State Teachers College, then to Livingston State College, Livingston University and finally to The University of West Alabama.

Livingston continued as the sleepy county seat of a mainly rural county, with a declining population. In the early 1960s, citizens made an effort to revitalize the town, building on their historic heritage and main street. The results were a near doubling in population in ten years, and corresponding increase in industry and businesses. In 1972 Livingston was named a finalist in the &quot;All American Cities Competition&quot;, sponsored by The Saturday Evening Post.

===Historic sites===
Livingston has a number of historic sites and properties. Lakewood (1840) is a historic antebellum mansion occupied by Julia Tutwiler while she was president of Livingston Normal College. The Sumter County Courthouse (1902) is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Additionally, the Branch-Stuart Home (1903), Inge-Moon House (1834), St. James Episcopal Church (1840), and Voss-Pate House (1850) are all listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage.

==Education==
University of West Alabama is in Livingston.

Sumter County School District operates public schools serving Livingston: Livingston Junior High School and Sumter Central High School. It was previously served by Livingston High School until it merged into Sumter Central High in 2011. In addition there is a charter school on the campus of the University of West Alabama in Livingston, University Charter School.

Sumter Academy, a private school, was in an unincorporated area near York. It closed in 2017.

<doc id="105144" wikidata="Q1284725" url="?curid=105144" title="Gantts Quarry, Alabama">
<text>Gantts Quarry is a quarry and former town in Talladega County, Alabama, United States. The population was zero at the 2000, 2010, and 2020 censuses, although it had seven residents as late as the 1998 population estimate. Incorporated in 1910 to keep neighboring Sylacauga from annexing it, it was officially disincorporated after its population dwindled to 0 effective 31 December 2001.

==History==
The history of the town goes back to 1830 when Dr. Edward Gantt discovered white marble and was one of the first towns in the county. A block of marble from the area is in the Washington Monument.
The 1930 census showed a population of 542 but the Great Depression and dwindling demand for marble used in building construction began the towns decline. In 1940 the population was 456 and by 1973 it was down to 63 residents. According to the 1990 U.S. Census, the incorporated town of Gantt&#x27;s Quarry had a population of seven.

When the town was first established, the town was governed by a mayor, a five-member city council, and the odd citizen out served as the town clerk. Company housing was set up for the employees. By the late 1960s, the company that owned the Quarry decided to demolish the company owned houses and this forced the residents to move to other towns and communities.

The town had its own post office, which also served as a library. The post office is pictured below. It was moved from the Quarry to its new location behind the B.B. Comer Museum in Sylacauga. In 2024, the post office was placed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage.

By the time of the 2000 Census, the town shows a population of zero, and much of it appears to have been annexed into the city of Sylacauga. Preventing such an annexation was most likely the reason the town incorporated in the first place.

==Demographics==
==Geography==
Gantts Quarry is located at 33°08&#x27;54&quot; North, 86°17&#x27;22&quot; West (33.152570, −86.28942).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the location has a total area of 0.9 km (0.3 mi2), all land.

There are numerous businesses along U.S. Highway 280, locally called &quot;the four-lane&quot;, and County Road 511, which was formerly U.S. 280 before construction of the four-lane.

In the middle of Oak Grove between its two hills there was a cut-your-own Christmas tree farm which yearly drew hundreds of families to Oak Grove. It was started in 1978 by later Oak Grove Mayor Bloise Zeigler, who operated the farm through 2009. Zeigler grew the official Alabama state Christmas tree, which was displayed at the Alabama Governor&#x27;s Mansion in 2004. The Christmas tree farm was closed in 2010 and donated by the former Mayor to the Town of Oak Grove as a community garden named &quot;Comet Grove&quot;. It provides free produce to low-income people and cheap produce to everyone else. It has ordinary open gardens and two acres of experimental &quot;plasticulture&quot;.

Oak Grove gained national recognition in 1954 when it became the first reported site in the history of the world of a meteor striking a human. Mrs. Ann E. Hodges was on her sofa in her Oak Grove home when something crashed through her roof, striking her on the hip. It turned out to be a meteorite. The incident gained national news coverage, including an appearance by Mrs. Hodges on Garry Moore&#x27;s TV show, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;. Celebrity participant Henry Morgan guessed the secret.

Oak Grove has a &quot;Gravity Hill&quot; where cars appear to coast uphill, but is actually an optical illusion. The phenomenon has generated news coverage and curiosity seekers. It is on Old Highway 280, now named &quot;Gravity Hill Road&quot;, just off Highway 280 in the western part of Oak Grove toward Childersburg.

One native son of Oak Grove was elected to the Alabama Public Service Commission. Jim Zeigler, born in neighboring Sylacauga in 1948 and raised in Oak Grove, won the PSC seat in 1974, becoming the youngest person to hold a state office. He won the seat two years after graduating from the University of Alabama, where he had been elected President of the Student Government Association, defeating the fraternity political party, &quot;The Machine&quot;.

<doc id="105149" wikidata="Q79477" url="?curid=105149" title="Sylacauga, Alabama">
<text>Sylacauga is a city in Talladega County, Alabama, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 12,578.

Sylacauga is known for its fine white marble bedrock. This was discovered shortly after settlers moved into the area and has been quarried ever since. The marble industry was the first recorded industry in the Sylacauga area.

Sylacauga is the site of the first documented case of an object from outer space hitting a person. On November 30, 1954, a piece of what became known as the Hodges Fragment from the Sylacauga Meteorite crashed through the roof of an Oak Grove house, bounced off a radio, and badly bruised Ann Hodges, who was taking an afternoon nap.

Sylacauga is on the 2010 list of &quot;100 Best Communities for Young People&quot; by America&#x27;s Promise Alliance.

==History==

The first historical account of the area comes from de Soto&#x27;s chroniclers as his expedition traveled south along the east bank of the Coosa River in 1540, encountering the town of Talisi at the edges of the Mississippian-era chiefdoms of Coosa and Tuskaloosa. The inhabitants of the Coosa River Valley were later united as the confederacy of Creek people. Their later encounters with Spanish and French settlers had a significant influence on the history of Sylacauga.

Events that occurred among these three groups were partly responsible for the settlement of the village of Chalakagay in 1748 near modern Sylacauga by refugee Shawnee Indians, led by Peter Chartier. In 1759 Chalakagay was listed in the French territorial records as a town inhabited by 50 Shawnee warriors. Late in the summer of 1836 most of the remaining Native Americans in Alabama were rounded up and forcibly escorted west of the Mississippi River, by United States Army forces under the authorization of the Indian Removal Act. They were forced to cede their land claims in the Southeast to yield to development by European Americans.

The name Sy-la-cau-ga may derive from the Indian words &quot;Chalaka-ge&quot;, which mean &quot;The Place of the Chalaka Tribe&quot;. Other scholars suggest that the name derives from the Creek words &quot;suli&quot; (buzzards) and &quot;kagi&quot; (roost). The city was first incorporated in 1838 as Syllacoga, and again in 1887 as Sylacauga.

Several important roads traversed the region as early as the 1830s. Numerous ferries connected communities on opposite sides of the rivers. In 1852, a plank road was built from Montgomery, the capital, to Winterboro, Alabama, passing through Sylacauga. The first railroad through Sylacauga was the Anniston and Atlantic Railroad, completed through here on December 1, 1886. In 1838, the first Sylacauga post office was established, with George Washington Stone as postmaster. He later served as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court.

The first newspaper, the &quot;Sylacauga Argus&quot;, started publication in 1887. The paper was printed and edited in Calera by H.G. McCall.

Sylacauga&#x27;s main thoroughfare is Broadway Avenue. The first building on this street was built in 1890 by the Smith Brothers.

Known as &quot;The Marble City&quot;, Sylacauga was developed on a solid deposit of what is claimed to be the finest marble in the world. Some buildings in the country, such as the United States Supreme Court, the Al Jolson Shrine in California, the Woolworth building in Houston, Texas, and many others have been constructed and ornamented with Sylacauga marble.

Sylacauga is located slightly to the east of the geographical center of the state of Alabama in Talladega County. The city is roughly southeast of Birmingham, north of Montgomery, and southwest of Anniston, Alabama.

===Marble industry===
The first recorded discovery of marble was in 1820 by Dr. Edward Gantt, a physician who had accompanied General Andrew Jackson through the area in 1814. Even Gantt probably did not realize the extent of this calcium carbonate deposit. The deposit is part of the &quot;Murphy Marble Belt&quot;, extending by deep. It is the world&#x27;s largest commercial deposit of madre cream marble.

In the 1830s, several quarries were opened in Talladega County and perhaps one in neighboring Coosa County. Using the old Plank Road, the operators shipped marble throughout central Alabama. By 1906, New York interests had bought Gantt&#x27;s quarry from its Ocala, Florida investors. This site became the center of marble-working activity. An elite town developed in and around this property, later called the Alabama Marble Company.

By the start of the 20th century, Sylacauga quarries had an established reputation, and shipments were being made throughout the state. Although structural marble was being produced to some extent, a very lucrative use of marble was found in the steel industry. More and more of the Sylacauga deposits were being blasted and used for fluxing steel. Later dolomite replaced marble in this process. In spite of the approaching depression, the late 1920s and early 1930s were times of spectacular growth for Sylacauga&#x27;s marble industry.

Technology changed the course of the industry when electricity replaced steam. Countless small marble operations had sprung up throughout the years. Facing tough competition, many went out of business or were absorbed by the larger companies, Alabama and Moretti-Harrah. One such significant merger was in 1929 when the Madras Marble Company (formerly Sylacauga Marble Corporation) merged with Moretti-Harrah.

In 1935 the Moretti-Harrah Company was sold to B.F. Coggins of Atlanta and T.A. McGahey of Columbus, Mississippi. In 1944 Coggins sold the Sylacauga operation and Columbia Marble Company of North Carolina to McGahey. The Alabama Marble Company remained under its own management until 1963, when it merged with the Georgia Marble Company.

The reputation of Sylacauga marble producers was shown by use of their marble on numerous building projects throughout the nation. Alabama Marble Company supplied marble for the 19th-century projects in Washington, DC, the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial. Marble supplied for the Washington monument was so like its Italian counterpart, Carrara marble, that it was placed aside until a confirmation of its origin could be made. Moretti-Harrah, in a year project shared with Gray-Knox Marble Company of Knoxville, supplied much of the marble for the U.S. Supreme Court building, including 36 massive interior columns measuring 22’ long x 3’4” in diameter.

Listing all the buildings that use this lustrous stone would be difficult. Other memorable projects are the Dime Savings Bank (New York), the Mercedes-Benz showroom (New York), the Chicago Post Office, the Alabama Archives Building, the Chrysler Mausoleum (New York), and the Al Jolson Shrine (California). Cream marble from Sylacauga can be found in hotels, offices, mausoleums, memorials and homes across the country.

Noted sculptor Gutzon Borglum, creator of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial, sculpted a masterpiece from Alabama marble – the bust of Abraham Lincoln. It is located in the rotunda of the nation&#x27;s Capitol. Borglum commented that the fine texture of Alabama marble enabled him to portray the expression of kindness on Lincoln&#x27;s face that he had never been able to do with any other stone.

By the 1940s endless uses for calcium products extracted from marble deposits became obvious. Calcium was needed for agricultural, pharmaceutical and paint products. Alabama Marble Company had already moved in this direction, having introduced its first Raymond Mill products for animal feed, insecticides, and joint cement materials in 1933. By-products were sold under the name of Alabama Calcium Products. By 1964, the company had completed one of the largest multi-product calcium carbonate plants in the United States, and in 1967 it closed its structural marble plant.

Moretti-Harrah chose to continue its structural finishing operations. With increasingly fast and updated precision machinery, it introduced new lines of tile, window sills, and other building products. In addition, Moretti-Harrah expanded operations to include calcium products, entering into a partnership with Thompson-Weinman and Company of Cartersville, Georgia, in 1944. In 1956, Thompson-Weinman expanded its own crushing operation in Sylacauga. Sylacauga Calcium Products was formed as a division of Moretti-Harrah.

Thompson, Weinman and Company remained privately owned until 1975, when it was purchased by Cyprus Mines Corporation. In 1979 Cyprus Mines was purchased by Standard Oil Company of Indiana, and it became a subsidiary of Amoco Minerals Company.

In 1983 an expansion project of its calcium carbonate facilities was conducted. The expansion involved the installation of additional grinding capacity and new mill facilities to enable increased production. Calcium carbonate, long used as the coating of paper, became an important filler as the paper industry converted from acid-based paper making systems to alkaline systems. In 1988 English China Clays (ECC) International purchased Moretti Harrah, and in 1989 ECC purchased Cyprus Thompson Weinman. Then, Georgia Marble Company purchased Cyprus Thompson Weinman.

In 1995, Imetal Group of Paris acquired the Georgia Marble Company, allowing this international company to strengthen its U.S. presence in the white pigments industry. Between 1994 and 1998, Imetal doubled in size; one-third through sales growth and two-thirds through acquisition. In 1999, Imetal acquired ECC. At that time the corporate name was changed to Imerys, to reflect a new minerals processing organization.

<text>Camp Hill is a town in Tallapoosa County, Alabama, United States. It was incorporated in 1895. At the 2010 census the population was 1,014, down from 1,273 in 2000. Camp Hill is the home to Southern Preparatory Academy (formerly known as &quot;Lyman Ward Military Academy&quot;).

==History==

On July 15, 1931, a white mob, led by Tallapoosa County sheriff Kyle Young and Camp Hill police chief J. M. Wilson—who voiced his desire to “kill every member of the ‘Reds’ there and throw them into the creek,” raided a meeting of the Alabama Sharecroppers&#x27; Union which was being held in a church in Camp Hill. A shootout between the mob and union members followed; SCU member Ralph Gray was murdered, his home burned, and his burned corpse was dumped on the courthouse steps. Dozens of black men and women were killed, lynched or injured, and at least thirty sharecroppers were later arrested. According to Hosea Hudson, all those arrested were eventually released without trial due to public and international pressure—albeit too late to have a chance at raising a crop that year.

<text>Dadeville is a city in and the county seat of Tallapoosa County, Alabama, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 3,230, up from 3,212 in 2000.

==History==
Prior to its incorporation, Dadeville was an Indian trading post and a center of commerce where commodities such as cotton, lumber, tin, asbestos, and livestock were traded. The town was surveyed by John H. Broadnax in 1836, granted a charter in 1837, and first incorporated in 1858. Dadeville was named for Major Francis Langhorne Dade, who was killed in 1835 by Seminole Indians in a battle of the Second Seminole War that came to be known as the &quot;Dade Massacre&quot;. Dade had never actually visited Tallapoosa County.

As a stagecoach stop on the Tennessee Road between Montgomery and Georgia, Dadeville was host to a stream of traders whose goods and livestock often crowded the square of the courthouse. Dadeville lost its charter during the Civil War, and was incorporated a second time in 1878. Dadeville has been the Tallapoosa County seat since 1838.

Dadeville was home to the Graefenberg Medical Institute, Alabama&#x27;s first medical school, which operated from 1852 until the outbreak of the Civil War. Attempts to revive the school after the war failed, and the building burned in 1873.

The completion of the Martin Dam on the Tallapoosa River in 1926 and the subsequent creation of Lake Martin had and continues to have a strong economic impact on Dadeville.

On April 15, 2023, four people were killed and 32 others were injured in a mass shooting at a party. Most of the victims were teenagers.

<text>Daviston is a town in Tallapoosa County, Alabama, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 214, down from 267 in 2000.

==History==

Daviston, incorporated February 16, 1887, is believed to be the first incorporated rural town in Tallapoosa County. The first mayor was J.D. Dunn. Daviston was a natural evolution of the opening of Indian lands in 1832. Much of the Federal Horse Path was within Creek Indian lands in 1832. With construction of Chapman Road from West Point, Georgia to Fort Williams, Alabama on the Coosa River, land areas opened up to white settlement.

Daviston flourished with improved roads and became a hub of migration. It had grist and saw mills, a blacksmith shop, buggy shop, coffin shop, general mercantile, public well, federal distillery, six saloons or inns, pharmacy, and doctors. The first land deed found was dated 1836 to S.W. Monk. The post office was established in 1853 with John Davis as the first postmaster. The story told over the years is that he used his own name for the town name. When he submitted the name to the government, due to poor penmanship or a mistake, &quot;Davis Town&quot; became Daviston and has since remained.

===Daviston School===

In 1883, Walker Allen and his twin, Walter, moved to Daviston. Walker Allen was elected principal of Daviston School. In 1884, a wooden two-story building was started on land given by J.T. Moncus to be called Daviston College. It became a high school around 1912. The building burned in 1923. Another building was built and burned before being used. A third building was constructed in 1923 and received accreditation that year. Lillie Thompson, who graduated in 1916, was the first graduate of Daviston High School.

The school closed in 1988. At the time of closing, it was the smallest school in Alabama with 120 K-12 students. Thirty-eight principals served from 1883–1988. For 105 years, Daviston School served as the center of the community. In 1998, a committee formed to initiate a Daviston School Reunion to be held annually in the center of the town on the second Saturday of November.

==Culture==

One of Northport&#x27;s cultural activities is the Kentuck Festival of the Arts. Each October, artists gather at Kentuck Park to showcase their work in front of visitors. The festival celebrates folk and contemporary art as well as traditional crafts. Potters, quilters, and basketmakers offer educational craft demonstrations throughout the weekend. “According to the [Kentuck Art] center, the annual two-day festival draws up to 20,000 visitors to the city each year and generates an estimated $5 million economic impact .”

Controversially, Kentuck Festival of the Arts’ board of directors announced that its 2024 festival will be held across the Black Warrior River and hosted by the city of Tuscaloosa. This comes after 52 years of the festival being held in Kentuck Park which is now being developed into a sports complex by the city of Northport. The contention between the Northport city council and the art festival’s board of directors grew to a breaking point after the city of Northport’s decision to decrease funding for Kentuck Festival of the Arts in 2023 and contract adjustments that would allow the city to change the location of the festival with as little as 30 days notice.

A tradition of Northport is Art Night, which is held on the first Thursday of each month. Many of Northport&#x27;s art galleries open their doors after hours for this event and art or craft demonstrations are offered. A bus system runs between downtown Northport and downtown Tuscaloosa as a collaboration with Tuscaloosa&#x27;s Art and Soul event.

Dickens Downtown is held the first Tuesday in December. This annual holiday event attracts participants to come and see the period setting of 19th-century England.

The Northport Heritage Museum houses a collection of artifacts and photographs that documents the history and evolution of the city.

Northport has high hopes of being added to the growing list of cities in Alabama to be in possession of a water park. Construction for the 22 million dollar project is expected to be completed by the year 2025. Increasing amounts of local residents have contested the newly identified water park location as it will likely cause noise disturbances, increase traffic congestion, and diminish home values. The long established farming community is also at risk of being pushed out of the area due to encroachment of the city of Northport’s urbanization projects.

<text>Tuscaloosa ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Tuscaloosa County in west-central Alabama, United States, on the Black Warrior River where the Gulf Coastal and Piedmont plains meet. Alabama&#x27;s fifth-most populous city, the population was 99,600 at the 2020 census, and was estimated to be 111,338 in 2023. It was known as Tuskaloosa until the early 20th century. It is also known as &quot;the Druid City&quot; because of the numerous water oaks planted in its downtown streets since the 1840s.

Incorporated on December 13, 1819, it was named after Tuskaloosa, the chief of a band of Muskogean-speaking people defeated by the forces of Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto in 1540 in the Battle of Mabila, in what is now central Alabama. It served as Alabama&#x27;s capital city from 1826 to 1846, where in 1846 it was moved to its present location in Montgomery.

Tuscaloosa is the regional center of industry, commerce, healthcare and education for the area of west-central Alabama known as West Alabama. It is the principal city of the Tuscaloosa Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Tuscaloosa, Hale and Pickens counties.

It is the home of the University of Alabama, Stillman College and Shelton State Community College. While it attracted international attention when Mercedes-Benz announced on September 30, 1993, that it would build its first North American automotive assembly plant in Tuscaloosa County, the University of Alabama remains the city&#x27;s dominant economic and cultural engine, making it a college town. City leaders adopted the moniker &quot;The City of Champions&quot; after the Alabama Crimson Tide football team won the College Football National Championship in their 2009, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2017 and 2020 seasons.

In 2008, Tuscaloosa hosted the USA Olympic Triathlon trials for the Beijing Games.

==History==

Reportedly the name Tuscaloosa is a compound Choctaw Indian word; &quot;tusko&quot; meaning &quot;warrior&quot; and &quot;loosa&quot; meaning &quot;black&quot;. The Black Warrior River flows through the north portion of the city. In 1809 Creek chief Occechemolta established a settlement at the falls of the River. (US-T125/Alabama: A Guide to the Deep South/p 244). County seat of Tuscaloosa County 1818 to 1822 and 1826 to the present. State capital from 1826 to 1846.

===Native American===
In 1828, Andrew Jackson was elected president of the United States. He had gained popularity when he defeated the Creek at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814, following victories in the War of 1812. He long proposed Indian removal to an Indian Territory to be established west of the Mississippi, to make land available in the Southeast for European-American settlement. Jackson abandoned the policy of his predecessors of treating different Indian groups as separate nations. Instead, he aggressively pursued plans to move all Indian tribes living east of the Mississippi River.

Following Congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act, in 1832 the Creek National Council signed the Treaty of Cusseta, ceding their remaining lands east of the Mississippi to the U.S., and accepting relocation to the Indian Territory. They had already been under pressure from new settlers encroaching on their territory. Most Muscogee-speaking peoples were removed to Indian Territory during the Trail of Tears in 1834, although some remained behind. Some Muscogee in Alabama live near Poarch Creek Reservation in Atmore (northeast of Mobile).

===Statehood and origin of name===

The pace of European settlement in the Southeast increased greatly after the War of 1812 and the Treaty of Fort Jackson and the subsequent availability of land previously settled by Native Americans. A small assortment of log cabins soon arose near the large Creek village at the fall line of the river, which the new settlers named in honor of the sixteenth-century Chief Tuskaloosa of a Muskogean-speaking tribecombining the Choctaw words &quot;tushka&quot; or &quot;tashka&quot; (&quot;warrior&quot;) and &quot;lusa&quot; (&quot;black&quot;).

In 1817, Alabama became a territory. On December 13, 1819, the territorial legislature incorporated the town of Tuskaloosa, one day before Congress admitted Alabama to the Union as a U.S. state.
From 1826 to 1846, Tuskaloosa was the capital of Alabama. The State House was built at the corner of 6th Street and 28th Avenue (now the site of Capitol Park). In 1831, the University of Alabama was established and the town&#x27;s population and economy grew rapidly, but the relocation of the capital to Montgomery caused a severe decline. The state legislature established Alabama State Hospital for the Insane (now Bryce Hospital) in Tuskaloosa in the 1850s, which helped restore the city&#x27;s fortunes.

===Civil War===
During the Civil War following Alabama&#x27;s secession from the Union, several thousand men from Tuscaloosa fought in the Confederate armies. During the last weeks of the War, the campus of the university was burned in a battle. The larger town was also damaged in the battle, and its White population suffered economically. Its Black population was emancipated from slavery.

In the 1890s the construction of a system of locks and dams on the Black Warrior River by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers improved navigation to such an extent that Tuscaloosa was effectively connected to the Gulf Coast seaport of Mobile. This stimulated the economy and trade, and mining and metallurgical industries were developed in the region. By the onset of the 20th century, the growth of the University of Alabama and the mental health-care facilities in the city, along with a strong national economy, fueled a steady growth in Tuscaloosa which continued unabated for 100 years.

===Civil rights movement===

In the post World War II era, African Americans increased their activism to ensure their constitutional civil rights and challenged southern segregation in numerous ways. In 1952, Autherine Lucy was admitted to the university as a graduate student, but her admission was rescinded when authorities discovered she was not White. After three years of legal wrangling, Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP got a court order preventing the university from banning Lucy and another student based on race. The following year, Lucy enrolled as a graduate student in Library Science on February 3, 1956, becoming the first Black admitted to a White public school or university in the state. During her first day of class on February 6, students and others rioted on the campus, where a mob of more than a thousand students pelted the car in which she was taken to her classes. Death threats were made against her, and the university president&#x27;s home was stoned. The riots were the most violent involving a pro-segregation demonstration since the landmark &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; Supreme Court decision. After the riots, the university suspended Lucy from school, stating her own safety was a concern; it later expelled her on a technicality. She was active in civil rights for a time, but withdrew later that year. Decades later, after her expulsion was annulled by the university in 1988, Lucy re-enrolled and completed her M.S. in Education and graduated, together with her daughter, in 1992.
On June 11, 1963, George Wallace, governor of Alabama, stood in front of the Foster Auditorium entrance at The University of Alabama in what became known as the Stand in the Schoolhouse Door in an attempt to stop desegregation of that institution by the enrollment of two African-American students, Vivian Malone and James Hood. He had created a challenge to federal orders, when confronted by US Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and federal marshals sent in by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, Wallace stepped aside. President John F. Kennedy had supported integration of the University of Alabama as well.

On June 9, 1964, in an event that later became known as Bloody Tuesday, a group of African-American Civil rights marchers were beaten, arrested and tear-gassed by police in Tuscaloosa while walking from the First African Baptist Church to the County Courthouse to protest against the segregated restrooms and drinking fountains of this public facility. Thirty-three people were sent to the hospital for treatment of injuries, and 94 were arrested. The events were not witnessed by outside journalists and had little influence outside the local community.

James Hood dropped out of the University of Alabama after two months. He later returned, and in 1997, received his Ph.D. in interdisciplinary studies. Malone persisted in her studies at the time and became the first Black American to graduate from the university. In 2000, the university granted her an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters. Later in his life, Governor Wallace apologized for his opposition at that time to racial integration.

In 2010, the university formally honored Lucy, Hood and Malone by renaming the plaza in front of Foster Auditorium as Malone-Hood Plaza and erecting the Autherine Lucy Clock Tower in the plaza. In 2022, the university dedicated the home of the College of Education as Autherine Lucy Hall.

===2011 tornado===
On April 27, 2011, Tuscaloosa was hit by a wide EF4 tornado that resulted in 64 deaths, more than 1500 injuries, and massive devastation. Most of the deaths, 44, were in Tuscaloosa alone, with the rest being in Birmingham and surrounding suburbs. The tornado&#x27;s top winds were estimated by the US National Weather Service at . Officials at DCH Regional Medical alone reported treating more than 1,000 injured people in the tornado aftermath. Officials reported dozens of unaccompanied minors being admitted for treatment at the hospital, raising questions about the possible loss of their parents. Several were taken to pediatric trauma wards, indicating serious injuries. Referring to the extent and severity of the damage, Mayor Walter Maddox stated that &quot;we have neighborhoods that have been basically removed from the map.&quot; The same tornado later went on to cause major damage in the Birmingham area. In all, the cost of damage from the tornado amounted to $2.45 billion, making it, at the time, the costliest tornado in U.S. history, though it would be surpassed less than a month later by the devastating Joplin, Missouri tornado of May 22.

The tornado was part of the 2011 Super Outbreak that affected large parts of the eastern United States and was the largest tornado outbreak ever recorded. In total, 324 people were killed by tornadoes during the outbreak, including 238 in Alabama alone. The tornadoes and other severe weather combined for over $10 billion in damage throughout the affected states, with more than 20% of the damage cost resulting from the tornado that struck Tuscaloosa.

In the immediate aftermath of the tornado, thousands of rescue workers dug through the wreckage looking for survivors and recovering bodies. More than 450 persons were originally listed as missing in the post-disaster chaos, leading to fears that the death toll could climb rapidly and skepticism about the relatively low fatality figures in relation to the high number of casualties. Rumors abounded that refrigerated trucks were being brought to store unidentified remains, and that countless bodies were beneath area waters. But the fatality figure did not increase (and was later reduced). Most persons listed as missing were later found to have survived. During this period, &quot;The Tuscaloosa News&quot; posted an on-line people finder to aid people to find each other, as well as determine who was still missing.

Two days after the storm, U.S. President Barack Obama and Alabama Governor Robert Bentley and their spouses, Michelle Obama and Diane Bentley, respectively, accompanied Mayor Maddox on a tour of the damage and the recovery efforts, along with FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate and several Congressional dignitaries. Remarking about the scale and severity of the damage, Obama said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen devastation like this, it&#x27;s heartbreaking&quot;, after touring the damaged areas. Obama pledged the full resources of the federal government toward aiding the recovery efforts. Bentley—himself a Tuscaloosa native—pledged additional national guard troops.

Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox announced that he was requesting 500 additional National Guard troops and calling for more volunteer aid workers and cadaver teams for the recovery of bodies, in order to prevent the spread of disease.

The New York Yankees organization contributed $500,000 to the American Red Cross and Salvation Army to aid in recovery efforts, and the Atlanta Braves organization donated $100,000. Actor Charlie Sheen visited the city to pay his respects on May 2 and donated supplies for relief efforts, along with several other actors, musicians and athletes.

Due to the disaster, on August 6, 2011, the University of Alabama held a delayed graduation ceremony for the class of 2011. It awarded posthumous degrees to six students who died in the tornado. The cable channel ESPN filmed a tribute in memory of the devastation.

===Bicentennial===
The city of Tuscaloosa celebrated its 200th birthday on December 13, 2019 with city officials holding various dedications and commemorative events throughout the city, including the displaying of a &quot;bicentennial quilt&quot; and a fireworks display following the 44th Annual West Alabama Christmas Parade, which was dedicated to the city&#x27;s birthday. The University of Alabama gave two sculptures to the city, one of a 30 foot-tall, 9,500-pound statue of the Roman goddess Minerva—designed by local artist Caleb O&#x27;Connor—at Manderson Landing park along the Black Warrior River, and a sculpture known as The Walkway. According to the Tuscaloosa200.com website, the Walkway is a &quot;replica of the route of the Black Warrior River from Demopolis to Tuscaloosa, it traces milestones in our city&#x27;s existence and survival, but its twists and turns, ebbs and flows have mirrored our city&#x27;s past.&quot; It was created by sculptor and architect Craig R. Wedderspoon.

A hermetically sealed time capsule was buried under a large boulder near the boat house near Manderson Landing; the time capsule is intended to capture &quot;What was life like in Tuscaloosa during the year 2019?&quot; and is set to be opened on December 13, 2069, the city&#x27;s 250th birthday.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , is water as of 2023. Most water within the city limits is in Lake Tuscaloosa, which is entirely in the city limits, and the Black Warrior River.

This city is located at (33.2098407, -87.5691735), approximately southwest of Birmingham. It lies on the fall line of the Black Warrior River, approximately upriver from the river&#x27;s confluence with the Tombigbee River at Demopolis. Because of its location on the boundary between the Appalachian Highland and the Gulf Coastal Plain, the geography of the area around Tuscaloosa is diverse, varying from heavily forested hills to the northeast to a low-lying, marshy plain to the southwest.

===Cityscape===
Major areas of Tuscaloosa city proper include:

* West Tuscaloosa
* Central/Midtown Tuscaloosa
* Downtown Tuscaloosa
* The University of Alabama main campus
* Alberta
* North River
* Hillcrest
* East Tuscaloosa

===Climate===
Typical of the Deep South, Tuscaloosa experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;). The Gulf of Mexico heavily influences the climate by supplying the region with warm, moist air. During the fall, winter, and spring seasons, the interaction of this warm, moist air with cooler, drier air from the North along fronts creates precipitation. These fronts usually move from west to east as they track along the jet stream. Notable exceptions occur during hurricane season, where storms may move from due south to due north or even from east to west during land-falling hurricanes. The interaction between low- and high-pressure air masses is most pronounced during the severe weather seasons in the spring and fall. During the summer, the jet stream flows well to the north of the southeastern U.S., and most precipitation is consequently convectional, i.e., caused by the warm surface heating the air above.

Severe thunderstorms can bring damaging winds, large hail, and occasionally tornadoes. An F4 tornado struck Tuscaloosa County in December 2000, killing eleven people. Tuscaloosa was struck by an F2 tornado in January 1997, which resulted in the death of one person. In April 2011, two tornadoes in a span of twelve days hit the city, the first being an EF3 on April 15, and the second and more devastating being an EF4 on April 27, when more than 50 deaths resulted. The city suffered considerable infrastructure damage.

Winter lasts from mid-December to late-February; the daily average temperature in January is . On average, the low temperature falls to the freezing mark or below on 46 days a year, and to or below on 4.4 days. While rain is abundant (January and February are on average the wettest months), measurable snowfall is rare, with most years receiving none and the average seasonal snowfall amounting to . Spring usually lasts from late-February to mid-May, becoming drier as the season progresses. Summers last from mid-May to mid-September, and the July daily average temperature is . There are 71–72 days of + highs annually and 3.5 days of + highs. The latter part of summer tends to be drier. Autumn, which spans from mid-September to early December, tends to be similar to spring in terms of temperature and precipitation. Due to its relative distance from the Gulf moderation, the annual temperature range averages between a summer high of and a winter low of . The 1991–2020 normals had the warmest summer night averaging and the coldest winter day at . Ice days are very infrequent, but tend to occur a few times per decade.

The highest recorded temperature at the Tuscaloosa Regional Airport was on July 29, 1952 and August 10, 2007, and the lowest recorded temperature was on January 21, 1985.

There are currently three branches: the Main branch, on Jack Warner Parkway; the Weaver-Bolden branch, in western Tuscaloosa; and the Brown branch in suburban Taylorville.

The University of Alabama, Stillman College and Shelton State Community College also have libraries open to the public for non-circulation use.

 Museums in Tuscaloosa are located all over town, but are primarily concentrated in the downtown area or on the campus of UA. Museums that are downtown include CHOM: the Children&#x27;s Hands-On Museum of Tuscaloosa and the Murphy African-American Museum. The Alabama Museum of Natural History and the Paul W. Bryant Museum are located on the UA campus. Additional museums and galleries are found across the river in Northport. The Jones Archaeological Museum is located south of Tuscaloosa at the Moundville Archaeological Park in Moundville.

===Performing arts===

Tuscaloosa is home to several performing arts organizations. Though some are affiliated with UA or Shelton State, several are independent organizations, including the Tuscaloosa Community Theater and Shakespeare troupe The Rude Mechanicals. These various organizations cooperate and coordinate their operations through the &quot;Arts and Humanities Council of Tuscaloosa County&quot;. The Arts Council also operates the Bama Theatre.

The Bama Theatre is a 1,094-seat proscenium theatre located in downtown Tuscaloosa and is operated by The Arts and Humanities Council. The Bama Theatre was built between 1937 and 1938 under the New Deal-era Public Works Administration as a movie palace. At the time of its construction in 1938, it was the only air-conditioned building in Tuscaloosa. The theatre was renovated as a performing arts center in 1976 and housed the Tuscaloosa Symphony Orchestra and Theatre Tuscaloosa troupe until those groups moved into their own facilities.

Today, the Bama Theatre is the residence of the Tuscaloosa Children&#x27;s Theatre Company and the Tuscaloosa Community Dancers. Additionally, it hosts the Arts Council&#x27;s Bama Art House movie series. The Bama Theatre hosts a Jewish Film Festival in the spring, as well as several traveling film festivals. Additionally, the Bama Theatre has recently been serving as a concert venue, hosting recent performances by Joan Baez, Aimee Mann, the Drive-By Truckers, Umphrey&#x27;s Mcgee, Ryan Adams, Chuck Leavell and many other performing artists.

The Frank Moody Music Building on the UA campus holds a 1000-seat Concert Hall and a 140-seat Recital Hall. The Concert Hall features a three-story-tall, 5,000-pipe Holtkamp organ and frequently hosts concerts and other musical events. The Recital Hall features a Schlicker organ that was crafted in Buffalo, New York. The Tuscaloosa Symphony Orchestra, in its 35th year, is based at the Moody Music Building and is conducted by Adam Flatt.

Also on the UA campus, Rowand-Johnson Hall holds the Marian Gallaway Theatre, a 305-seat proscenium theater, the Allen Bales 170-seat thrust theatre, and the 600-seat Morgan Auditorium. These facilities primarily host university-sponsored performing arts shows, such as Dance Alabama and the university&#x27;s theater productions.

The Sandra Hall-Ray Fine Arts Centre on the Shelton State campus holds the Bean-Brown Theatre, a 450-seat proscenium theater, and the 100-seat Alabama Power Foundation Recital Hall.

Tuscaloosa is also home to the Alabama Choir School.

Coleman Coliseum is a 15,383-seat multipurpose arena that serves as the city of Tuscaloosa&#x27;s municipal civic center. Because the City of Tuscaloosa does not have a civic center, the demand for events grew rapidly and the coliseum doubled its capacity in the 1970s. In the 1990s, marquee concerts and events that the arena had seen in the previous two decades grew scarce as the facility became more outdated and mostly devoted to Crimson Tide athletic events. In the hope that the university could pull more events at the facility, the coliseum underwent a significant renovation in 2005, costing over $24 million.

Tuscaloosa, as the largest county seat in western Alabama, serves a hub of state and federal government agencies. In addition to the customary offices associated with the county courthouse, namely two district court judges, six circuit court judges, the district attorney and the public defender, several Alabama state government agencies have regional offices in Tuscaloosa, such as the Alabama Department of Transportation and the Alabama State Troopers (the state police).

Tuscaloosa is in the federal jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. There is a courthouse in Tuscaloosa simply called the Federal Courthouse. Several federal agencies operate bureaus out of the courthouse.

Federally, Tuscaloosa is split between the 4th and 7th Congressional Districts, which are represented by Robert Aderholt (R) and Terri Sewell (D), respectively. In addition, Alabama&#x27;s senior senator until 2023, Richard Shelby (R), is a resident of Tuscaloosa.

On the state level, the city is split among the 5th, 21st, and 24th Senate districts and 62nd, 63rd, and 70th House districts in the Alabama State Legislature.

Interstate 359 spurs off from I-20/I-59 and heads northward, ending in downtown Tuscaloosa.

Tuscaloosa also contains one toll road on the Black Warrior Parkway (I-20/I-59), charging $1.25 for automobiles, and one toll bridge (Black Warrior Parkway bridge).

====Rail====
Amtrak provides passenger rail service to Tuscaloosa though the Crescent line, which connects the area to major cities along the east coast from New York City to New Orleans. Tuscaloosa station is situated at 2105 Greensboro Avenue, one mile (1.6 km) south of downtown. Norfolk Southern Railway and Alabama Southern Railroad provide freight services to the area. KCS previously provided service to the area before leasing its lines to Watco in July 2005.

====Bus====
Greyhound Bus Lines provides passenger bus service to Tuscaloosa. The Tuscaloosa Transit Authority operates the Tuscaloosa Trolley System while the University of Alabama operates a separate bus service known as CrimsonRide. The Tuscaloosa Trolley provides local public bus transportation with four fixed routes that operate Monday through Friday from 5:00 am to 6:00 pm. The trolley&#x27;s paint job is an illusion; it is an El Dorado Transmark RE bus, painted to look like a trolley.

====Airport====
The Tuscaloosa National Airport (KTCL) is 3.5 miles northwest of Tuscaloosa in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. Owned and operated by the City of Tuscaloosa, the airport is an FAA-designated National General Aviation Airport and Part 139 Certified. Tuscaloosa National Airport covers 826 acres at an elevation of 170’ including two runways: Runway 4/22 is 6,499’ x 150’ and 12/30 is 4,000’ by 100’.

====Major highways====
Tuscaloosa is served by many major highways, including I-20, I-59, and U.S. Route 82. I-20/59 run west to east through the southern part of the city, leading northeast 58 mi (93 km) to Birmingham and southwest 96 mi (154 km) to Meridian, Mississippi. US 82 runs northwest to southeast through the city, locally known as McFarland Boulevard, and leads southeast 103 mi (166 km) to Montgomery, Alabama and northwest 59 mi (95 km) to Columbus, Mississippi. Many other state and local highways run through the city as well, in addition to a tolled bypass on the western side of the city connecting those coming from the west on US 82 to I-20/59 without going through the main part of the city.

====Port of Tuscaloosa====
The Port of Tuscaloosa is a river port located in the City of Tuscaloosa and administered by the Alabama State Port Authority.

The Black Warrior River is bounded along nearly its entire course by a series of locks and dams. They form a chain of narrow reservoirs, providing aids to navigation and barge handling as well as hydroelectric power and drinking water. The Black Warrior River watershed is a vital river basin entirely contained within Alabama, America&#x27;s leading state for freshwater biodiversity. Near Tuscaloosa, the river flows out of the rocky Cumberland Plateau and enters the sandy East Gulf Coastal Plain. Barge transportation in and out of the Port of Tuscaloosa and other commercial navigation make the Black Warrior a silent giant in the state of Alabama&#x27;s economy. Although the Port of Tuscaloosa is a small one, it is one of the larger facilities on the Black Warrior River at waterway mile marker 338.5. There are no railway connections at this port as they primarily concentrate on the shipment of dry bulk commodities, including lignite, coal and coal coke. The federal government and the City of Tuscaloosa share the ownership of the Port of Tuscaloosa; the operation of the port is leased out to Powell Sales and has been run by them since 1997.

At waterway mile marker 343.2 on the opposite side of the river is a steel company with its own tracks at the rear of the plant connecting with the Kansas City Southern Railroad for barge shipments of iron and steel products such as ingots, bars, rods, steel slabs, plates and coils. Tuscaloosa Steel Corporation was one of the first U.S. steel companies to implement the Steckel Mill Technology.

The Port of Tuscaloosa grew out of the system of locks and dams on the Black Warrior River built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the 1890s. Its construction opened up an inexpensive transportation link to the Gulf seaport of Mobile, Alabama that stimulated the mining and metallurgical industries of the region that are still in operation.

The Army Corps of Engineers has maintained a system of locks and dams along the Black Warrior River for over a century to allow navigability all the way up to Birmingham. Barge traffic thus routinely runs through Tuscaloosa to the Alabama State Docks at Mobile, Alabama. Via the Tenn-Tom Waterway, the city is connected to the Ohio River valley and beyond.

<text>Carbon Hill is a city in Walker County, Alabama, United States. It incorporated in February 1891. At the 2010 census the population was 2,021, down from 2,071 in 2000.

==History==
About 310 million years ago, Carbon Hill was located in a swampy area south of the equator. A number of important fossil discoveries and trackways have been located near Carbon Hill.

Carbon Hill, Alabama was settled in 1886 because of coal mining and the railroad. A post office was established in 1887 with John T. Anderson as the first Postmaster. By 1888, the community had grown enough to support the Carbon Hill United Methodist Church.

The Galloway Coal Company was responsible for the early development of Carbon Hill. Col. Robert Galloway entered the coal and transfer business in 1863. On May 1, 1890, Galloway bought mines and property on Carbon Hill (as it was then called) from The Kansas City Coal and Coke Company for $130,000. Galloway turned the operation into a commercial success. Other mining companies set up operations after word spread of Galloway&#x27;s success.

On February 1, 1891, the Sheriff of Walker County telegraphed the governor of Alabama requesting fifty soldiers to be dispatched to Carbon Hill. Mayor Anderson wired: &quot;There is a lawless mob here. Colored people are shot and driven from home. No arrest made. We need troops.&quot; Superintendent B. W. Whitfield of the Carbon Hill Coal and Coke Company was anxious to fire 200 striking miners, and the men had caught word of it. The strikers feared the black citizens would take their jobs.

On February 14, 1891, the town of Carbon Hill was incorporated, with John T. Anderson as mayor. February 14 is also known as St. Valentine&#x27;s Day; the founding fathers wanted the tiny town to be known as The Village of Love and Luck. The notion of coal as luck derives from the cultural traditions of Scotland (where Colonel Galloway was born) - it is also customary and considered lucky in Scotland and the North of England to give coal as a gift on New Year&#x27;s Day. This occurs as part of First-Footing and represents warmth for the year to come.

On May 27, 1917, an F3 tornado hit Carbon Hill, killing 6 people and destroying 200 homes in an area 3 miles wide by 17 miles long.

Carbon Hill was &quot;especially hard-hit by the Depression,&quot; and became known for its &quot;savvy utilization of federal resources&quot; provided by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Public Works Administration (PWA). Residents used the funding to build a new high school, and made improvements to sewers, sidewalks, and streets.

<doc id="105169" wikidata="Q79249" url="?curid=105169" title="Cordova, Alabama">
<text>Cordova is a city in Walker County, Alabama, United States. It was formerly a textile mill town. It was incorporated in 1897. At the 2010 census the population was 2,095, down from 2,423 in 2000.

==History==
Cordova was originally a settlement on the Mulberry Fork of the Black Warrior River called &quot;Dent&quot; or &quot;Dent&#x27;s Place.&quot; The city was dubbed &quot;Cordova&quot; by Captain Benjamin M. Long in 1859. He named the city after a city in Mexico where he was stationed during the Mexican–American War. Long himself opened a mercantile shop in the city and helped lure other industries into the city by providing the land necessary for their operations.

The company that had the biggest impact on the city was Nashua Manufacturing Company out of Nashua, New Hampshire, who brought in the Indian Head Textile Mills. The mill brought with it many jobs, and as was customary of the day, its own village. The company built over 100 houses in the city, many of which are still standing, and occupied today. The company even built the Indian Head school on the site of present-day &quot;Cordova Health and Rehabilitation Center.&quot; The mill helped to bring two major railways to the city, which at the time helped connect the city to much of the surrounding area. The mill eventually became its own &quot;town&quot; and even had its own separate police force.

Indian Head Mills was one of the most highly awarded textile mills during World War II. Their products were found to be above all standards set forth by the government by the War Department. The Mill was referred to by the residents as the Cordova Spinners.

The same way the mill shaped the city around the turn of the 20th century, it also shaped it upon its closing in the middle of the century, after 1962. Over 800 workers lost jobs, the population declined, and industry slowed, while neighboring Jasper took a strong hold on the county seat as the largest city in the county.

===Present-day Cordova===

With access to the Gulf of Mexico via the Warrior and Alabama Rivers, two major railways (Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Norfolk Southern), Interstate 22, and the recent addition of BAE Systems, the city is hoping for economic growth.

Gilchrist House, located near Cordova, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===2011 tornadoes===

On April 27, 2011, an EF3 tornado tore through the city in the early hours of the morning, and the city was hit by an EF4 tornado in the afternoon near 5 pm. The afternoon tornado cut a swath through downtown. It destroyed the majority of the historic downtown district, including the city hall, police station, fire station, the old Tallulah Hotel, Piggly Wiggly grocer, People&#x27;s Bank, and damaged the majority of the central business district beyond repair. The Long Memorial United Methodist Church was also heavily damaged, which had sheltered nearby residents in the basement during the tornado.

The city has completed the following recovery projects since the 2011 tornadoes; $1.5 million Piggly Wiggly grocery store, $3.7 million city hall &amp; police station, $2.4 million sewer treatment plant, $1.5 million utility line replacement, and are currently completing a $250,000 fire-station remodel.

The town of Nauvoo was founded in 1888, during the construction of the Northern Alabama Railway, and was formerly a center of coal mining. The town grew out of isolated agricultural settlements on the Walker County-Winston County line, which had been known unofficially as Blackwell&#x27;s Crossing and Ingle Mills (or Ingle&#x27;s Mill) after prominent local landowners. Railroad construction drove the development of the town center on Joshua Blackwell&#x27;s property, but he declined to have the new town be named officially in his honor. The local resident Tom Carroll suggested the name &quot;Nauvoo,&quot; after Nauvoo, Illinois — a city founded by Mormon prophet Joseph Smith in 1839 and later the site of an Icarian colony settlement — reportedly &quot;because he had admired the [Illinois] town... in his earlier travels through that state.&quot; By 1891, the town was mentioned in the &quot;Winston Herald&quot; as &quot;Nauvoo, a flourishing town with three stores and one steam gin doing good business.&quot; Nauvoo incorporated in 1906.

<doc id="105181" wikidata="Q623276" url="?curid=105181" title="Deadlock (computer science)">
<text>In concurrent computing, deadlock is any situation in which no member of some group of entities can proceed because each waits for another member, including itself, to take action, such as sending a message or, more commonly, releasing a lock. Deadlocks are a common problem in multiprocessing systems, parallel computing, and distributed systems, because in these contexts systems often use software or hardware locks to arbitrate shared resources and implement process synchronization.

In an operating system, a deadlock occurs when a process or thread enters a waiting state because a requested system resource is held by another waiting process, which in turn is waiting for another resource held by another waiting process. If a process remains indefinitely unable to change its state because resources requested by it are being used by another process that itself is waiting, then the system is said to be in a deadlock.

In a communications system, deadlocks occur mainly due to loss or corruption of signals rather than contention for resources.

==Individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for deadlock==
A deadlock situation on a resource can arise only if all of the following conditions occur simultaneously in a system:
# &quot;Mutual exclusion:&quot; multiple resources are not shareable; only one process at a time may use each resource.
# &quot;Hold and wait&quot; or &quot;resource holding:&quot; a process is currently holding at least one resource and requesting additional resources which are being held by other processes.
# &quot;No preemption:&quot; a resource can be released only voluntarily by the process holding it. 
# &quot;Circular wait:&quot; each process must be waiting for a resource which is being held by another process, which in turn is waiting for the first process to release the resource. In general, there is a set of waiting processes, &quot;P&quot; = {&quot;P&quot;1, &quot;P&quot;2, ..., &quot;P&quot;&quot;N&quot;}, such that &quot;P&quot;1 is waiting for a resource held by &quot;P&quot;2, &quot;P&quot;2 is waiting for a resource held by &quot;P&quot;3 and so on until &quot;P&quot;&quot;N&quot; is waiting for a resource held by &quot;P&quot;1.

These four conditions are known as the &quot;Coffman conditions&quot; from their first description in a 1971 article by Edward G. Coffman, Jr.

While these conditions are sufficient to produce a deadlock on single-instance resource systems, they only indicate the possibility of deadlock on systems having multiple instances of resources.

==Deadlock handling==
Most current operating systems cannot prevent deadlocks. When a deadlock occurs, different operating systems respond to them in different non-standard manners. Most approaches work by preventing one of the four &quot;Coffman conditions&quot; from occurring, especially the fourth one. Major approaches are as follows.

===Ignoring deadlock===
In this approach, it is assumed that a deadlock will never occur. This is also an application of the Ostrich algorithm. This approach was initially used by MINIX and UNIX. This is used when the time intervals between occurrences of deadlocks are large and the data loss incurred each time is tolerable.

Ignoring deadlocks can be safely done if deadlocks are formally proven to never occur. An example is the RTIC framework.

===Detection===
Under the deadlock detection, deadlocks are allowed to occur. Then the state of the system is examined to detect that a deadlock has occurred and subsequently it is corrected. An algorithm is employed that tracks resource allocation and process states, it rolls back and restarts one or more of the processes in order to remove the detected deadlock. Detecting a deadlock that has already occurred is easily possible since the resources that each process has locked and/or currently requested are known to the resource scheduler of the operating system.

After a deadlock is detected, it can be corrected by using one of the following methods:
# &quot;Process termination:&quot; one or more processes involved in the deadlock may be aborted. One could choose to abort all competing processes involved in the deadlock. This ensures that deadlock is resolved with certainty and speed. But the expense is high as partial computations will be lost. Or, one could choose to abort one process at a time until the deadlock is resolved. This approach has a high overhead because after each abort an algorithm must determine whether the system is still in deadlock. Several factors must be considered while choosing a candidate for termination, such as priority and age of the process.
# &quot;Resource preemption:&quot; resources allocated to various processes may be successively preempted and allocated to other processes until the deadlock is broken.

===Prevention===
Deadlock prevention works by preventing one of the four Coffman conditions from occurring.
* Removing the &quot;mutual exclusion&quot; condition means that no process will have exclusive access to a resource. This proves impossible for resources that cannot be spooled. But even with spooled resources, the deadlock could still occur. Algorithms that avoid mutual exclusion are called non-blocking synchronization algorithms.
* The &quot;hold and wait&quot; or &quot;resource holding&quot; conditions may be removed by requiring processes to request all the resources they will need before starting up (or before embarking upon a particular set of operations). This advance knowledge is frequently difficult to satisfy and, in any case, is an inefficient use of resources. Another way is to require processes to request resources only when it has none; First, they must release all their currently held resources before requesting all the resources they will need from scratch. This too is often impractical. It is so because resources may be allocated and remain unused for long periods. Also, a process requiring a popular resource may have to wait indefinitely, as such a resource may always be allocated to some process, resulting in resource starvation. (These algorithms, such as serializing tokens, are known as the &quot;all-or-none algorithms&quot;.)
* The &quot;no preemption&quot; condition may also be difficult or impossible to avoid as a process has to be able to have a resource for a certain amount of time, or the processing outcome may be inconsistent or thrashing may occur. However, the inability to enforce preemption may interfere with a &quot;priority&quot; algorithm. Preemption of a &quot;locked out&quot; resource generally implies a rollback, and is to be avoided since it is very costly in overhead. Algorithms that allow preemption include lock-free and wait-free algorithms and optimistic concurrency control. If a process holding some resources and requests for some another resource(s) that cannot be immediately allocated to it, the condition may be removed by releasing all the currently being held resources of that process. 
* The final condition is the &quot;circular wait&quot; condition. Approaches that avoid circular waits include disabling interrupts during critical sections and using a hierarchy to determine a partial ordering of resources. If no obvious hierarchy exists, even the memory address of resources has been used to determine ordering and resources are requested in the increasing order of the enumeration. Dijkstra&#x27;s solution can also be used.

===Deadlock avoidance===
Similar to deadlock prevention, deadlock avoidance approach ensures that deadlock will not occur in a system. The term &quot;deadlock avoidance&quot; appears to be very close to &quot;deadlock prevention&quot; in a linguistic context, but they are very much different in the context of deadlock handling. Deadlock avoidance does not impose any conditions as seen in prevention but, here each resource request is carefully analyzed to see whether it could be safely fulfilled without causing deadlock.

Deadlock avoidance requires that the operating system be given in advance additional information concerning which resources a process will request and use during its lifetime. Deadlock avoidance algorithm analyzes each and every request by examining that there is no possibility of deadlock occurrence in the future if the requested resource is allocated. The drawback of this approach is its requirement of information in advance about how resources are to be requested in the future. One of the most used deadlock avoidance algorithms is Banker&#x27;s algorithm.

== Livelock ==

A &quot;livelock&quot; is similar to a deadlock, except that the states of the processes involved in the livelock constantly change with regard to one another, none progressing.

The term was coined by Edward A. Ashcroft in a 1975 paper in connection with an examination of airline booking systems. Livelock is a special case of resource starvation; the general definition only states that a specific process is not progressing.

Livelock is a risk with some algorithms that detect and recover from &quot;deadlock&quot;. If more than one process takes action, the deadlock detection algorithm can be repeatedly triggered. This can be avoided by ensuring that only one process (chosen arbitrarily or by priority) takes action.

==Distributed deadlock==
&quot;Distributed deadlocks&quot; can occur in distributed systems when distributed transactions or concurrency control is being used.

Distributed deadlocks can be detected either by constructing a global wait-for graph from local wait-for graphs at a deadlock detector or by a distributed algorithm like edge chasing.

&quot;Phantom deadlocks&quot; are deadlocks that are falsely detected in a distributed system due to system internal delays but do not actually exist. For example, if a process releases a resource &quot;R1&quot; and issues a request for &quot;R2&quot;, and the first message is lost or delayed, a coordinator (detector of deadlocks) could falsely conclude a deadlock (if the request for &quot;R2&quot; while having &quot;R1&quot; would cause a deadlock).

<text>Camden is a city in and the county seat of Wilcox County, Alabama, United States. The population was 2,020 at the 2010 census, down from 2,257 in 2000, at which time it was a town.

==History==

What is now Camden was established on property donated by Thomas Dunn from his plantation holdings in order to have a new town founded on the site in 1833 to serve as the county seat. Dunn&#x27;s Federal style house, built in 1825, is the oldest documented house in the town. The first county seat was in the community of Canton Bend.

The county seat was moved in 1833 to Barboursville, later renamed Camden. It had been named Barboursville in honor of United States Congressman Philip P. Barbour of Virginia. Incorporated in 1841, Camden was renamed by local physician John D. Caldwell in honor of his hometown of Camden, South Carolina.

The area depended on cultivation of cotton as a commodity crop, which was worked by numerous African American slaves. The earliest documented industries in the town were a brickyard, sawmill, and window fabricator. The &quot;Camden Phenix&quot; was the town&#x27;s earliest known newspaper. Townspeople founded a girls&#x27; school in 1844, the Wilcox Female Seminary and Female Institute, whose red-brick Greek-Revival style building was constructed from 1845 to 1850. In 1976 the former school was adapted to house the Wilcox County Historical Society.

The red-brick Greek-Revival style Wilcox County Courthouse, also listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was completed in 1857. It replaced an earlier wood-frame structure.

During the American Civil War, many in the community joined the Confederate cause. The county courthouse was ransacked by Union forces in 1865, but advance warning allowed county officials to remove the county records to a safe place (legend claims that they were buried in a coffin) prior to arrival of Union troops. Already devastated by the Civil War, Camden suffered fires during 1869 and 1870 that destroyed about two-thirds of the town. The town began to recover during the 1880s, with the first bank incorporated in 1894.

Camden benefited economically during the mid-20th century with the construction of a paper mill at Yellow Bluff and of the Millers Ferry Lock and Dam, a hydroelectric dam on the Alabama River near Millers Ferry. This created the William &quot;Bill&quot; Dannelly Reservoir, which has served as an important recreational resource.

==Geography==

<text> (; BSS; &quot;Keep Sweden Swedish&quot;) was a far-right, nativist organisation based in Stockholm, Sweden and the precursor of the current Sweden Democrats political party; it also remains a slogan used by various Swedish nationalist parties. The stated objective of the BSS movement, and the aim of the slogan, was to initiate a debate in order to stop immigration by non-Europeans and repatriate non-ethnic Swedes. Inspiration came from the post-World War II fascist organisation Nysvenska Rörelsen created by Per Engdahl. The group was often violent.

Founded as a loosely organised network in 1979 by Leif Zeilon, and formalised as an organisation in 1983, BSS was involved with the populist Progress Party () in 1986. This co-operation took place under the name Sweden Party (). This cooperation evolved into the Sweden Democrats () (SD) in 1988.

Claiming not to be racists, their often aggressive sticker campaigns arguably indicated otherwise with slogans such as &quot;Låt inte din dotter bli en negerleksak&quot; (Don&#x27;t let your daughter become a negro toy) and &quot;Negrer hotar sina offer&quot; (Negros threaten their victims).

The slogan &quot;Keep Sweden Swedish&quot; was taken on by the Sweden Democrats and became prevalent during 2003–2004, when it was used for headlines in the party newspaper &quot;SD Kuriren&quot; and as a slogan on bumper stickers and T-shirts.

<doc id="105200" wikidata="Q8849" url="?curid=105200" title="Cancer (constellation)">
<text>Cancer is one of the twelve constellations of the zodiac and is located in the Northern celestial hemisphere. Its name is Latin for crab and it is commonly represented as one. Cancer is a medium-size constellation with an area of 506 square degrees and its stars are rather faint, its brightest star Beta Cancri having an apparent magnitude of 3.5. It contains ten stars with known planets, including 55 Cancri, which has five: one super-earth and four gas giants, one of which is in the habitable zone and as such has expected temperatures similar to Earth. At the (angular) heart of this sector of our celestial sphere is Praesepe (Messier 44), one of the closest open clusters to Earth and a popular target for amateur astronomers.

== Characteristics ==
Cancer is a medium-sized constellation that is bordered by Gemini to the west, Lynx to the north, Leo Minor to the northeast, Leo to the east, Hydra to the south, and Canis Minor to the southwest. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Cnc&quot;. 

The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 3 main and 7 western edgework forming sides (&quot;illustrated in infobox&quot;). In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between and . Covering 506 square degrees or 0.921% of the sky, it ranks 31st of the 88 constellations in size. It can be seen at latitudes between +90° and -60° and is best visible at 9 p.m. during the month of March. Cancer borders the bright constellations of Leo, Gemini and Canis Minor. Under city skies, Cancer is invisible to the naked eye.

==Features==

===Stars===

Cancer is the dimmest of the zodiacal constellations, having only two stars above the fourth magnitude. The German cartographer Johann Bayer used the Greek letters Alpha through Omega to label the most prominent stars in the constellation, followed by the letter A, then lowercase b, c and d. Within the constellation&#x27;s borders, there are 104 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6.5.
Also known as Altarf or Tarf, Beta Cancri is the brightest star in Cancer at apparent magnitude 3.5. Located 290 ± 30 light-years from Earth, it is a binary star system, its main component an orange giant of spectral type K4III that is varies slightly from a baseline magnitude of 3.53—dipping by 0.005 magnitude over a period of 6 days. An aging star, it has expanded to around 50 times the Sun&#x27;s diameter and shines with 660 times its luminosity. It has a faint magnitude 14 red dwarf companion located 29 arcseconds away that takes 76,000 years to complete an orbit. Altarf represents a part of Cancer&#x27;s body.

At magnitude 3.9 is Delta Cancri, also known as Asellus Australis. Located 131±1 light-years from Earth, it is an orange-hued giant star that has swollen and cooled off the main sequence to become an orange giant with a radius 11 times and luminosity 53 times that of the Sun. Its common name means &quot;southern donkey&quot;. The star also holds a record for the longest name, &quot;Arkushanangarushashutu,&quot; derived from ancient Babylonian language, which translates to &quot;the southeast star in the Crab.&quot; Delta Cancri also makes it easy to find X Cancri, the reddest star in the sky. Known as Asellus Borealis &quot;northern donkey&quot;, Gamma Cancri is a white-hued A-type subgiant of spectral type A1IV and magnitude 4.67, that is 35 times as luminous as of the Sun. It is located 181 ± 2 light-years from Earth.

Iota Cancri is a wide double star. The primary is a yellow-hued G-type bright giant star of magnitude 4.0, located 330 ± 20 light-years from Earth. It spent much of its stellar life as a B-type main sequence star before expanding and cooling to its current state as it spent its core hydrogen. The secondary is a white main sequence star of spectral type A3V and magnitude 6.57. Despite having different distances when measured by the HIPPARCOS satellite, the two stars share a common proper motion and appear to be a natural binary system.

Located 181 ± 2 light-years from Earth, Alpha Cancri (Acubens) is a multiple star with a primary component an apparent white main sequence star of spectral type A5 and magnitude 4.26. The secondary is of magnitude 12.0 and is visible in small amateur telescopes. Its common name means &quot;the claw&quot;. The primary is actually two very similar white main sequence stars that are 5.3 AU distant from each other and the secondary is two small main sequence stars, most likely red dwarfs, that are 600 AU from the main pair. Hence the system is a quadruple one.

Zeta Cancri or Tegmine (&quot;the shell&quot;) is a multiple star system that contains at least four stars located 82 light-years from Earth. The two brightest components are a binary star with an orbital period of 1100 years; the brighter component is a yellow-hued binary pair and the dimmer component is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 6.2. The brighter component is itself a binary star with a period of 59.6 years; its primary is of magnitude 5.6 and its secondary is of magnitude 6.0. This pair is at its greatest separation around 2019.

Ten star systems have been found to have planets. Rho1 Cancri or 55 Cancri (or Copernicus) is a binary star approximately 40.9 light-years distant from Earth. 55 Cancri consists of a yellow dwarf and a smaller red dwarf, with five planets orbiting the primary star; one low-mass planet that may be either a hot, water-rich world or a carbon planet and four gas giants. 55 Cancri A, classified as a rare &quot;super metal-rich&quot; star, is one of the top 100 target stars for NASA&#x27;s Terrestrial Planet Finder mission, ranked 63rd on the list. The red dwarf 55 Cancri B, a suspected binary, appears to be gravitationally bound to the primary star, as the two share common proper motion.

YBP 1194 is a sunlike star in the open cluster M67 that has been found to have three planets.

===Deep-sky objects===

Cancer is best known among stargazers as the home of Praesepe (Messier 44), an open cluster also called the &quot;Beehive Cluster&quot;, located right in the centre of the constellation. Located about 590 light-years from Earth, it is one of the nearest open clusters to our Solar System. M 44 contains about 50 stars, the brightest of which are of the sixth magnitude. Epsilon Cancri is the brightest member at magnitude 6.3. Praesepe is also one of the larger open clusters visible; it has an area of 1.5 square degrees, or three times the size of the full Moon. It is most easily observed when Cancer is high in the sky. North of the Equator, this period stretches from February to May. 

Ptolemy described the Beehive Cluster as &quot;the nebulous mass in the breast of Cancer.&quot; It was one of the first objects Galileo observed with his telescope in 1609, spotting 40 stars in the cluster. Today, there are about 1010 high-probability members, most of them (68 percent) red dwarfs. The Greeks and Romans identified the nebulous object as a manger from which two donkeys, represented by the neighbouring stars [1213] Asellus Borealis and [1210] Asellus Australis, were eating. The stars represent the donkeys that the god Dionysus and his tutor Silenus rode in the war against the Titans. The ancient Chinese interpreted the object as a ghost or demon riding in a carriage, calling it a &quot;cloud of pollen blown from under willow catkins.&quot;

The smaller, denser open cluster Messier 67 can also be found in Cancer, 2600 light-years from Earth. It has an area of approximately 0.5 square degrees, the size of the full Moon. It contains approximately 200 stars, the brightest of which are of the tenth magnitude.

QSO J0842+1835 is a quasar used to measure the speed of gravity in VLBI experiment conducted by Edward Fomalont and Sergei Kopeikin in September 2002.

OJ 287 is a BL Lacertae object located 3.5 billion light years away that has produced quasi-periodic optical outbursts going back approximately 120 years, as first apparent on photographic plates from 1891. It was first detected at radio wavelengths during the course of the Ohio Sky Survey. Its central supermassive black hole is among the largest known, with a mass of 18 billion solar masses, more than six times the value calculated for the previous largest object.

==History and mythology==

Cancer was first recorded by Claudius Ptolemy in the in &quot;The Mathematical Syntaxis&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Almagest&quot;), under the Greek name (&quot;Karkinos&quot;).

In the late 1890s, R.H. Allen asserted the following, with no supporting citation:
:&quot;Cancer is said to have been the place for the Akkadian &quot;Sun of the South&quot;, perhaps from its position at the winter solstice in very remote antiquity; but afterwards it was associated with the fourth month &quot;Duzu&quot; , our June–July, and was known as the &quot;Northern Gate of Sun&quot; ...&quot;

Very few of Cancer&#x27;s stars are visible to the naked eye, and its brightest stars are only 4th magnitude. Cancer was often considered the &quot;Dark Sign&quot;, quaintly described as &quot;black and without eyes&quot;. Dante, alluded to its faintness in &quot;Paradiso&quot;, and mentioned it being visible for the whole night when it culminated at midnight in a Northern Hemisphere winter month:

:Then a light among them brightened,
:so that, if Cancer one such crystal had,
:winter would have a month of only a day.

Cancer was the backdrop to the Sun&#x27;s most northerly position in the sky (the summer solstice) in ancient times, when the Earth&#x27;s Sun-facing side was maximally tilted towards the south, in the Gregorian calendar kept within a few days of June 21. Equivalently, this is the date when the Sun is directly overhead as far north as 23.437° N. The northern-most parallel where the sun is directly overhead is still called the &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;, even though the corresponding position on the sky now occurs in Taurus, due to the precession of the equinoxes.

The close conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in 1563 – which was observed by Tycho Brahe and led him to note the inaccuracy of existing ephemerides and to begin his own program of astronomical measurements – occurred in Cancer not far from Praesepe.

In Greek mythology, Cancer is identified with the crab that appeared while Heracles fought the many-headed Lernaean Hydra. Hercules slew the crab after it bit him in the foot. Afterwards, the goddess Hera, an enemy of Heracles, placed the crab among the stars.

==Illustrations==
The modern symbol for Cancer represents the pincers of a crab, but Cancer has been represented as many types of creatures, usually those living in the water, and always those with an exoskeleton.

In the Egyptian records of about 2000 BC it was described as Scarabaeus (Scarab), the sacred emblem of immortality. In Babylonia the constellation was known as MUL.AL.LUL, a name which can refer to both a crab and a snapping turtle. On boundary stones, the image of a turtle or tortoise appears quite regularly and it is believed that this represents Cancer since a conventional crab has not so far been discovered on any of these monuments.

There also appears to be a strong connection between the Babylonian constellation and ideas of death and a passage to the underworld, which may be the origin of these ideas in later Greek myths associated with Hercules and the Hydra.

In the 12th century, an illustrated astronomical manuscript shows it as a water beetle. Albumasar writes of this sign in &quot;Flowers of Abu Ma&#x27;shar&quot;. A 1488 Latin translation depicts cancer as a large crayfish, which also is the constellation&#x27;s name in most Germanic languages. Jakob Bartsch and Stanislaus Lubienitzki, in the 17th century, described it as a lobster.

==Names==
R.H. Allen, in &quot;Star Names: Their lore and meanings&quot;, lists names for the constellation as follows:
:In Ancient Greece, Aratus called the crab (&quot;Karkinos&quot;), which was followed by Hipparchus and Ptolemy. The Alfonsine tables called it &quot;Carcinus&quot;, a Latinized form of the Greek word. Eratosthenes extended this as , , (&quot;Karkinos&quot;, &quot;Onoi&quot;, &quot;kai Fatne&quot;): the Crab, Asses, and Crib. In Ancient Rome, Manilius and Ovid called the constellation &quot;Litoreus&quot; (shore-inhabiting). &quot;Astacus&quot; and &quot;Cammarus&quot; appear in various classic writers, while it is called &quot;Nepa&quot; in Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Finibus&quot; and the works of Columella, Plautus, and Varro; all of these words signify a crab, lobster, or scorpion.

:Athanasius Kircher said that in Coptic Egypt it was (&quot;Klaria&quot;), the &quot;Bestia seu Statio Typhonis&quot; (the Power of Darkness). Jérôme Lalande identified this with Anubis, one of the Egyptian divinities commonly associated with Sirius.

:The Indian language Sanskrit shares a common ancestor with Greek, and the Sanskrit name of Cancer is &quot;Karka&quot; and &quot;Karkata&quot;. In Telugu it is &quot;Karkatakam&quot;, in Kannada &quot;Karkataka&quot; or &quot;Kataka&quot;, in Tamil &quot;Kadagam&quot;, and in Sinhala . The later Hindus knew it as &quot;Kulira&quot;, from the Greek (&quot;Kolouros&quot;), the term originated by Proclus.

==Astrology==

, the Sun appears in the constellation Cancer from July 20 – August 9. In tropical astrology, the Sun is considered to be in the &quot;sign&quot; of Cancer from June 22 – July 22, and in sidereal astrology, from July 16 – August 16. The symbol of the astrological sign (which now covers roughly the constellation of Gemini) is (♋︎).

==Equivalents==
In Chinese astronomy, the stars of Cancer lie within the Vermilion Bird of the South (南方朱雀, &quot;Nán Fāng Zhū Què&quot;).

<text>Akutan ( , ) is a city on Akutan Island in the Aleutians East Borough of the Aleutian Islands in Alaska, United States. The population was 1,589 at the 2020 census, up from 1,027 in 2010, making it the 4th fastest-growing city of the decade in Alaska. Akutan Harbor is adjacent.

==Geography==
Akutan is located at . Akutan is located in the Aleutian Islands Recording District.

Akutan is located on Akutan Island in the eastern Aleutians, one of the Krenitzin Islands in the Fox Islands group. It is east of Unalaska, and southwest of Anchorage. Akutan lies in the maritime climate zone, resulting in mild winters and cool summers. Mean temperatures range from , and precipitation averages per year. High winds and storms are frequent in the winter, and fog is common in the summer.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (25.69%) is water.

==History and culture==

Akutan began in 1878 as a fur storage and trading port for the Western Fur &amp; Trading Company. The company&#x27;s agent established a commercial cod fishing and processing business that quickly attracted nearby Unangan to the community. A Russian Orthodox church and a school were built in 1878, but was replaced by the St. Alexander Nevsky Chapel, built in 1918.

The Pacific Whaling Company built a whale processing station across the bay from Akutan in 1912. It was the only whaling station in the Aleutians, and operated until 1939.
After the Japanese attacked Unalaska in June 1942, the U.S. government evacuated Akutan residents to the Ketchikan area. In June 1942, a Japanese A6M Zero fighter piloted by Tadayoshi Koga crashed on Akutan Island. It was recovered in July by the United States Army Air Force. This plane, dubbed the Akutan Zero, significantly aided American tacticians in devising dog fighting techniques to defeat the Zero, and helped change the course of the war.

The village was re-established in 1944, although many villagers chose not to return. This exposure to the outside world brought many changes to the traditional lifestyle and attitudes of the community. The city was incorporated in 1979.

A federally recognized tribe is located in the community—the Native Village of Akutan. The population of the community consists of 16.4% Alaska Native or part Native. Akutan is a fishing community, and is the site of a traditional Unangan village.

Funds have been requested to develop two new water catchment dams, and construct a new 125,000-gal. water storage tank and treatment plant. Sewage is piped to a community septic tank, with effluent discharge through an ocean outfall. Refuse is collected three times a week; a new landfill site and incinerator were recently completed. The City recycles aluminum. Trident Seafoods operates its own water, sewer and electric facilities. Electricity is provided by Akutan Electric Utility.

There is one school located in the community, Akutan School of the Aleutians East Borough School District (AEBSD), attended by 18 students. Circa October 1978 the school, then a part of the Aleutian Region School District, had a single teacher, and 12 students.

Cargo is delivered weekly by freighter from Seattle; the City owns and operates a landing craft, the M/V Akutan. Akutan has no airstrip due to the steep terrain, however, a seaplane base is available and open to the public. Helicopter service between Akutan and Akun Island, the location of Akutan Airport, began in February 2014. The only airline company serving the airport is Grant Aviation, flying to nearby Dutch Harbor. The airport was expected to cost $77 million of which nearly $60 million came from the U.S. federal government. Trident paid $1 million towards the cost of the airport.

<doc id="105202" wikidata="Q79523" url="?curid=105202" title="Cold Bay, Alaska">
<text>Cold Bay (,; Sugpiaq: &quot;Pualu&quot;) is a city in Aleutians East Borough, Alaska, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 108, but at the 2020 census this had reduced to 50.

Cold Bay is one of the main commercial centers of the Alaska Peninsula, which extends west towards the Aleutian Islands, and is home to Cold Bay Airport.

==History==

There is evidence of prehistoric occupation by Aleuts and later Russian encampments. Cold Bay&#x27;s significance to American history began with the Japanese invasion of the Aleutians in World War II. General Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr. ordered the creation of Fort Randall, an airbase on the shores of Cold Bay, in 1942 as a part of a general expansion of American assets in the Aleutians. It (along with Otter Point) served as a base for the 11th Air Force to provide protection to the only deep water port in the Aleutians at the time, Dutch Harbor.

This protection was necessary when during Yamamoto&#x27;s Midway Campaign, a diversionary attack was launched against Dutch Harbor. The initial attack was repulsed by the surprise presence of P-40s stationed here. A second larger attack with its own fighter escort the next day caused minor damage. Later, with the victory in the Pacific, the forces grew to 20,000 troops. The quonset huts used to house this massive encampment still stand around the community. It also was a base of operations for the US Navy with the seaplane tender among the ships based in Cold Bay.

In the spring and summer of 1945, Cold Bay was the site of the largest and most ambitious transfer program of World War II, Project Hula, in which the United States transferred dozens of ships and craft to the Soviet Union and trained Soviet personnel in their operation in anticipation of the Soviet Union entering the war against Japan.

In later decades, control of the airfield passed to civil authorities, who maintained it as a useful refueling and emergency landing location for great circle flights from the west coast of the United States to East Asia. A Distant Early Warning Line station established nearby was eventually decommissioned.

During the 1980s, deregulation of the airline industry under President Ronald Reagan caused many of the compelling interests supporting the need for the community to evaporate. Today, Cold Bay is still occasionally used for emergency or precautionary landings of commercial flights, and is also a hub for traffic from Anchorage and Seattle to the small communities around it.

==Geography==
Cold Bay is located at (55.209038, -162.714298). It is west of Hawaii.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (23.34%) is water.

Cold Bay holds the record for most overcast community in America.

===Climate===

Cold Bay has an either an ocean-moderated subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfc&quot;) if the 0 °C isotherm is used, or a subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfc&quot;) if the isotherm is used, both of those climate being typical of southwest Alaska, though the summers are almost cool enough to qualify as a tundra (Köppen climate classification: &quot;ET&quot;). Cold Bay is considered the cloudiest place in the United States, with an average of 304 days of heavy overcast (covering over 3/4 of the sky).

Cold Bay&#x27;s recorded temperature range is between and . The coldest daytime maximum on record is , while the annual coldest maximum between 1991 and 2020 was at . With warm summer days being rare, nights remain chilly also during the warmer season. The warmest recorded overnight low is at a very modest and the annual average warmest night tends to fall to .

A raft race and &quot;Polar Bear Jump&quot; are also held. The Derby concludes with a banquet and door prize giveaway at the town community hall.

==Parks and recreation==

===Izembek National Wildlife Refuge===

The Izembek refuge was established in 1960. It encompasses several large lagoons, including the long Izembek Lagoon, which serve as a food source and shelter for a large migratory bird population.

Approximately 150,000 Pacific black brant, 62,000 emperor geese, 50,000 Taverner&#x27;s Canada geese, 300,000 ducks, and 80,000 shore birds stop over in the Izembek area during migration and as many as 50,000 Steller&#x27;s eiders find winter grounds there.

==Government==
Cold Bay was incorporated as a city in January 1982. Cold Bay is classified by the state government as a second-class city.

==Education==

===Cold Bay School===
The Cold Bay School was the community&#x27;s public grade school, operated by the Aleutians East Borough School District (AEBSD), until its closure in May 2015. AEBSD&#x27;s school board voted to close Cold Bay School following the conclusion of the 2014–2015 school year due to a decline in enrollment, which led to the loss of state funding. The school employed one teacher and served between four and nine students in its last years. The loss of the school caused an exodus of the remaining school-aged children until, by 2015, only one was left.

Circa 1978 the school, then a part of the Aleutian Region School District, had two teachers, and 37 students. In the 1980s, the school typically enrolled around 30 students. In 1985 it reached peak enrollment, with 50 students and four teachers. Despite its remote location, the school was involved in state and national activities, such as hosting the military&#x27;s &quot;Operation Arctic Care&quot; outreach health program in 2002, and by briefly becoming involved with reporting for CNN Student Bureau that same year.

The school building was used to house passengers of flights which made emergency landings in Cold Bay.

==Infrastructure==

<text>False Pass () is a city on Unimak Island, in the Aleutians East Borough of southwestern Alaska, United States. Although the population was marked 397 including seasonal fish processing plant workers at the 2020 census, approximately 35 residents call it home year-round.

==History==
False Pass is an early English name for Isanotski Strait on which the city of False Pass is located. The strait was called &quot;False Pass&quot; by early American sailing ship captains because it was thought to be impassable for their deep draft vessels at the northern end. A salmon cannery was built on the Unimak Island side of the strait in 1919 which provided the nucleus for the modern settlement. A U.S. post office with the name of False Pass was established in 1921 which gave official status to the community.

Commercial fishing for salmon, cod, halibut and crab continues to be the core of the community&#x27;s lifestyle and economy.

==Geography==
False Pass is at (54.827886, -163.399090). It is near the eastern end of Unimak Island, in the Aleutian Islands chain. Part of the city (26.093 km2, or 10.075 sq mi) is on the mainland&#x27;s westernmost tip Alaska Peninsula, across the Isanotski Strait (about 600 meters at the closest point), although that section is nearly unpopulated. The city boundaries include the abandoned villages of Morzhovoi and Ikatan.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (60.63%) is water.

==Transportation==

About 3.3% of families and 11.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 1.7% of those under age 18 and 27.3% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==
King Cove&#x27;s economy depends almost completely on the year-round commercial fishing and seafood processing industries. All five species of salmon are abundant in the waters near King Cove.

76 residents hold commercial fishing permits. Income is supplemented by subsistence activities.

=== Peter Pan Seafoods ===
The city was home to Peter Pan Seafoods&#x27; largest processing facility, one of the largest cannery operations under one roof in Alaska. The plant, with origins back to the early 1900s, had the largest salmon canning capacity of any plant in Alaska. At peak seasons, both winter and summer, nearly 500 employees staffed the operation.

King Crab, bairdi and opilio tanner crab, pollock, cod, salmon, halibut and black cod harvested in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska were processed by the plant throughout the year. Salmon remained a major part of the annual operation, but in recent years the plant had expanded and streamlined whitefish operations. The plant produced several product forms including pollock fillet block, shatterpack fillets, mince and surimi. Cod shatterpack fillets and salt cod are mainstays.

In April 2024, Peter Pan Seafoods announced that the company would cease operations, including that of their King Cove plant. As of February 2025, with the plant still closed, the city was considering a major reduction in the next year’s budget, and asking the state for financial assistance. With families moving away, school enrollment was down 20 percent.

=== Current access to the mainland ===
The community is served by King Cove Airport, a state-owned public use airport with a gravel runway. A locally based FAA certificated Part 135 company called Eider Air provides on demand air-taxi service and charter operations to villagers and visitors. Grant Aviation also flies to King Cove, and has the contract for mail services.

It is also served by the Alaska Marine Highway, the state-run ferry service which connects it with Cold Bay in the west and Sand Point in the east.

=== Proposed road to Cold Bay ===
A partially completed road between King Cove and Cold Bay is awaiting approval through the United States Department of the Interior. According to a report generated by The Wilderness Society, the road would cause irreparable damage to the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. The previous negative decision by former Interior Secretary Sally Jewell is being reconsidered to include a land swap. Proponents of the road state it would help local citizens in need of medical evacuation when airplanes can not land or take off from the local airport due to darkness or weather conditions. Opponents contend the road&#x27;s main purpose is, as it always has been, to provide a link between King Cove and a nearby airport for commercial reasons. No evidence has been put forward to support a road would be safer in difficult weather condition than air transport.

On January 22, 2018, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke signed a land swap agreement to allow construction of the road, but U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason blocked it in a ruling in March 2019, on the grounds that Zinke had failed to respond to the environmental concerns which Secretary Jewell had cited in justifying blocking the proposed land swap. In 2020, Zinke&#x27;s successor as Interior Secretary, David Bernhardt, approved a revised land swap agreement, and specifically responded to those environmental concerns; U.S. District Court Judge John W. Sedwick blocked the revised land swap agreement as well, on the grounds that Bernhardt&#x27;s response to the environmental issues was inadequate. In August 2020, the Trump administration appealed Judge Sedwick&#x27;s ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

In March 2021, the Biden administration announced that it would continue the appeal started by the Trump administration, contrary to the expectations of many observers, who assumed the Biden administration would take the opposite decision. A  draft environmental impact statement, issued in November by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of the Interior, supports a land exchange between the federal government and King Cove’s Native corporation to allow construction of a road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.

==Healthcare==

The King Cove Community Health Clinic is run by the Eastern Aleutian Tribes and provides routine medical care, behavioral health, and emergency care services. The clinic is open Monday through Friday during normal business hours, closed for all Alaskan and Federal holidays. After hours emergencies are handled by on-call practitioners. There is an active local emergency medical services group who provide ambulance service. Care is also provided through Community Health Aide Practitioners, which are unique to Alaska.

==Education==
Aleutians East Borough School District (AEBSD) operates the King Cove School.

As of 2019 the King Cove School had 13 teachers and approximately 85 students.
