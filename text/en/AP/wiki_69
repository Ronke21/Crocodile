<text>Dog Day Afternoon is a 1975 American biographical crime drama film directed by Sidney Lumet and produced by Martin Bregman and Martin Elfand. The film stars Al Pacino, John Cazale, James Broderick and Charles Durning. The screenplay is written by Frank Pierson and is based on the &quot;Life&quot; magazine article &quot;The Boys in the Bank&quot; by P.F. Kluge and Thomas Moore. The feature chronicles the 1972 robbery and hostage situation led by John Wojtowicz and Salvatore Naturile at a Chase Manhattan branch in Brooklyn.

Elfand brought Bregman&#x27;s attention to the article, who proceeded to negotiate a deal with Warner Bros. and clear the rights to use the story. Pierson conducted his research and wrote a script that centered on the story of the robbery around Wojtowicz. The cast was selected by Lumet and Pacino, with the latter selecting past co-stars from his off-Broadway plays. Filming took place between September and November 1974, and the production was finished three weeks ahead of schedule.

When theatrically released on September 21, 1975, &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; was a critical and box-office success. The film was nominated for seven Golden Globe Awards and six Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. In 2009, &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress, and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

== Plot ==
On August 22, 1972, first-time crook Sonny Wortzik and his friends Salvatore &quot;Sal&quot; Naturile and Stevie attempt to rob the First Brooklyn Savings Bank. The plan immediately goes awry when Stevie loses his nerve and flees. Sonny discovers that they arrived after the daily cash pickup, and they find only $1,100 in cash.

Sonny takes the bank&#x27;s traveler&#x27;s checks and burns the register in a trash can, but the smoke raises suspicion outside, and the building is surrounded by police. The two panicked robbers take the bank employees hostage.

Police Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti calls the bank, and Sonny bluffs that he is prepared to kill the hostages. Sal assures Sonny that he is ready to kill if necessary. A security guard has an asthma attack, so Sonny releases him as a display of good faith. Moretti convinces Sonny to step outside. Using the head teller as a shield, Sonny begins a dialogue with Moretti that culminates in his shouting, &quot;Attica! Attica!&quot;, to invoke the recent Attica Prison riot. The crowd begins to cheer for Sonny.

Sonny demands a vehicle to drive himself and Sal to the airport, so that they can board a jet. He also demands that pizzas be brought to the hostages, and that his wife be brought to the bank. Sonny&#x27;s life-partner Leon Shermer arrives and reveals that the robbery was intended to pay for Leon&#x27;s sex reassignment surgery, and he divulges that Sonny has children with his estranged wife Angie.

As night sets in, the bank&#x27;s lights are shut off as FBI agent Sheldon takes command of the scene. He refuses to give Sonny any more favors, but when the bank manager Mulvaney goes into diabetic shock, Sheldon allows a doctor to go inside. Sheldon convinces Leon to talk to Sonny on the phone. Leon had been hospitalized at Bellevue Hospital after a suicide attempt. Leon turns down Sonny&#x27;s offer to join him and Sal in their escape, and Sonny tells the police that Leon had nothing to do with the robbery.

Sonny agrees to let Mulvaney leave, but the manager refuses to leave his employees. The FBI calls Sonny out of the bank to talk to his mother, who fails to persuade him to surrender. Inside, Sonny dictates his will to one of the hostages, acting as a secretary, leaving money from his life insurance for Angie and for Leon to have the surgery.

When the requested limousine arrives, Sonny checks for hidden weapons or booby traps, and selects Agent Murphy to drive him, Sal and the remaining hostages to Kennedy Airport. Sonny sits in the front beside Murphy, with Sal behind him. Murphy repeatedly asks Sal to point his gun at the roof so that Sal will not accidentally shoot him.

As they wait on the airport tarmac for the plane to taxi into position, Sal releases another hostage, who gives him her rosary beads for his first plane trip. Murphy again reminds Sal to aim his gun away. Sal does, and Sheldon seizes Sonny&#x27;s weapon, allowing Murphy to pull a revolver hidden in his armrest and shoot Sal in the head. Sonny is immediately arrested, and the hostages are freed.

Sonny watches as Sal&#x27;s body is taken from the car on a stretcher. We learn that Sonny is sentenced to twenty years in prison, that Angie and her children subsist on welfare, and that Leon is a woman living in New York City.

== Background ==
On August 22, 1972, John Wojtowicz, Salvatore Naturile and Robert Westenberg attempted to rob a branch of the Chase Manhattan Bank at 450 Avenue P in Gravesend, Brooklyn. The robbers aimed to take the US$150,000–$200,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) that they expected to be delivered at 3:30 p.m. that afternoon by an armored truck. According to Wojtowicz, a Chase Manhattan executive that he met at a gay bar in Greenwich Village tipped him off. They entered the bank at 3:00 p.m. to discover that the armored truck had instead taken the money away at 11:00 a.m. The robbers took the $29,000 () that was available at the branch and tried to escape. Westenberg was successful, but Wojtowicz and Naturile were left behind as the police arrived on the scene. The robbery then turned into a hostage situation.

Two hours into the negotiations, Wojtowicz and Naturile extended a list of demands to the police: release Elizabeth Eden (Ernest Aron) from Kings County Hospital Center in exchange for a hostage, bring hamburgers and Coca-Cola, and provide transportation to John F. Kennedy International Airport for them and the hostages. In the words of Wojtowicz: &quot;I want them to deliver my wife here from King&#x27;s County hospital. His name is Ernest Aron. It&#x27;s a guy. I&#x27;m gay.&quot; They also requested a plane to fly to a safe location, where the unharmed hostages were to be released. After more than fourteen hours of holding the hostages, Naturile was killed, and Wojtowicz was arrested at Kennedy Airport.

Wojtowicz told Judge Anthony J. Travia that the motive for the robbery was to pay for a sexual reassignment surgery for Eden. Shortly after a suicide attempt in 1971, Eden expressed to Father Gennaro Aurichio the desire to marry Wojtowicz. Aurichio recalled Eden told him, &quot;I&#x27;m all mixed up. I want to be a girl. I have to marry the boy I introduced you to. If I don&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll be more successful next time.&quot; Aurichio, who counseled Eden, agreed to perform a ceremony. He told Eden that he would &quot;perform a blessing&quot; but that he was unable and unwilling to &quot;perform a homosexual marriage&quot;. Aurichio was subsequently defrocked. Arthur Bell, an investigative journalist, expressed his belief that the surgery was a peripheral motive for the robbery. Bell met Wojtowicz before the hold up through the Gay Activists Alliance, under the alias of &quot;Littlejohn Basso&quot;. In his article published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, he laid out Wojtowicz&#x27;s connection to pornographer Mike Umbers and proposed that the heist was organized by the Gambino crime family instead.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
&quot;Life&quot; published in its September 22, 1972, issue a chronicle of the robbery. The feature, written by P.F. Kluge and Thomas Moore, was titled &quot;The Boys in the Bank&quot;. It detailed the holdup and the hostages&#x27; eventual fraternization with their captors. The authors compared Wojtowicz&#x27;s appearance to that of Dustin Hoffman or Al Pacino. The feature caught the attention of producer Martin Elfand. Elfand took it to Martin Bregman, who piqued the interest of Warner Bros. executive Richard Shepherd. Elfand hired Kluge and Moore to interview the people involved in the story. Before the script was written, Elfand wanted to ensure that he had signed releases by all the interviewees for the story rights. After the negotiation, each hostage received $600 (); one hostage asked for more money and was not included in the script.

Initially, Westenberg was offered $2,000, but he turned it down following the advice of his lawyer, because he was still serving a two-year sentence. After his release, he settled for $750. Wojtowicz received $7,500 () for the rights to the story. From the money, he earmarked $2,500 to Eden&#x27;s reassignment surgery.

News outlets reported that Wojtowicz was granted one percent of the film&#x27;s net profit; Bregman later denied that his company, Artists Entertainment Complex, granted Wojtowicz a percentage of the gross. Bregman added he would give him $25,000 if the film performed as well as &quot;Serpico&quot; (1973) at the box office. Wojtowicz&#x27;s lawyer Mark Landsman retained $3,500 of the payment he received. Meanwhile, Warner Bros. paid for Naturile&#x27;s funeral. The working title of the film was &quot;The Boys in the Bank&quot;. The budget was set at an estimate of $3.8 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

Frank Pierson was hired to write the screenplay. Aside from Kluge and Moore&#x27;s research, Pierson conducted his own. He contacted journalist Randy Wicker, who covered the story of the heist for gay publications, and provided technical assistance regarding Manhattan&#x27;s gay nightclub scene. Pierson decided that he wanted to center the story around Wojtowicz, who refused to receive Pierson in prison while he was in a financial dispute with Warner Bros.

Pierson analyzed the tapes of the interviews and news articles about the robbery, and approached those involved for additional information. Pierson could not define Wojtowicz&#x27;s character because a different impression was left on each of the interviewees. The project overwhelmed him, but he could not quit because he had spent his cash in advance. Pierson reviewed his material and found that the unfulfilled promises Wojtowicz made was the common trait. Pierson viewed them as &quot;the story of the bank&quot;, and the failure of the robbery.

Pierson finished the screenplay by Christmas 1973. Author Leslie Waller worked on a novelization of the Pierson script, released after the film, by Dell Publishing.

=== Casting ===
With the finished script, Martin Bregman met with director Sidney Lumet and star Al Pacino in London. Pacino, who, at the time, was represented by Bregman, agreed to play the role.

Pacino backed out, and Dustin Hoffman expressed interest. Bregman did not meet with Hoffman; he felt that Pacino could bring the &quot;sensitivity&quot; and &quot;vulnerability&quot; needed for the role. After more discussion, Pacino accepted the part but rejected it again. Bregman attributed it to Pacino&#x27;s use of method acting and said that it &quot;might have been a world [Pacino] did not want to explore&quot;. Bregman added that &quot;no major star had ever played a gay&quot;.

But he wanted to make the film with Pacino. The actor backed out of the project a third time, and told Bregman that he wanted to return to the theater. He said that he would &quot;never make the adjustment necessary for the movies&quot;. Pacino again returned to the project, and attributed his behavior to stress and drinking, and that he needed &quot;a life outside work&quot;. Lumet mentioned the characterization of Sonny Wortzik&#x27;s (Wojtowicz) &quot;insane framework of life&quot; as the stress factor for Pacino. In a meeting before the rehearsals, Pacino asked Pierson and Lumet to tone down Sonny Wortzik&#x27;s behavior; his request was rejected. Eden described Wojtowicz as &quot;a very domineering person&quot;, and added: &quot;he is good-natured ... but sometimes went overboard ... and he terrified me&quot;. Wicker later said that the screenplay of &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; portrayed Wojtowicz to be &quot;more rational than he really was&quot;.
Much of the cast consisted of actors Pacino performed with in off-Broadway plays. Pacino asked Lumet to cast John Cazale as Sal Naturile, whose was the only name that did not change for the film. Pacino had worked with Cazale on Israel Horovitz&#x27;s play &quot;The Indian Wants the Bronx&quot;, and then in the 1972 film &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Lumet was not initially convinced he should cast Cazale. He was thirty-nine years old, while Naturile was eighteen years old at the time of his death, but the director agreed after meeting him. Penelope Allen starred as Sylvia &quot;Mouth&quot; (based on Shirley &quot;Mouth&quot; Ball), and had worked with Pacino before on &quot;Scarecrow&quot;. For the role of Wortzik&#x27;s mother, Pacino asked Lumet to cast Judith Malina, co-founder of The Living Theatre. Lumet wanted to portray the difference between a street police officer and one with an office job. Charles Durning and James Broderick were cast as Moretti and Sheldon respectively, though Lumet initially decided on Durning being the bank manager and Broderick playing Moretti until Pacino intervened. Because Durning was also working on Robert Wise&#x27;s &quot;Two People&quot;, Lumet and Wise had to coordinate his schedule, as he flew between California and New York. Lumet did not worry about Broderick&#x27;s recasting because of his reputation for method acting. Sully Boyar was cast as bank manager Mulvaney (based on Robert Barrett). Chris Sarandon convinced Lumet and Pacino during his reading and was cast as Leon Shermer. Lumet asked him to shift the focus of his characterization to &quot;a little less Blanche DuBois, a little more Queens housewife&quot;.

There were three weeks of rehearsals, and the name of the project was changed to &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;. Pierson flew from Los Angeles to New York at Lumet&#x27;s request. Pacino refused to kiss Sarandon in a scene as he thought it was &quot;exploitative&quot;; he felt that the script kept &quot;pushing the gay issue&quot; on the audience. He expressed the view that viewers already knew the characters were homosexual and wanted to convey the failure of the relationship instead. Pierson agreed; he realized the couple did not actually kiss and that they had actually carried on a phone conversation. Pierson modified the scene to include the call. The National Gay Task Force approved of the script. Ronald Gold, then director of the organization, welcomed it as &quot;sensitive and tasteful&quot;.

=== Filming ===
==== Opening scene ====
Filming took place between September and November 1974. The opening montage shows New York&#x27;s traffic, bridges, beaches, and neighborhoods before moving to a view of the Manhattan skyline from a cemetery. Lumet wanted to convey &quot;a hot boring day, a dog day afternoon&quot;. The director shot the footage from a station wagon, and ended in front of the bank, showing the robbers. The footage was silent, as Lumet decided that he did not want a score for the film. The director felt that &quot;he could not reconcile trying to convince an audience that this really happened ... with putting a music score into it&quot;. Editor Dede Allen played Elton John&#x27;s composition &quot;Amoreena&quot; in the editing room. Lumet added the song to the film, which comes out of the getaway car&#x27;s radio.

==== The bank ====
Most of the film took place inside of the bank. Lumet discarded the idea of building a studio set; instead, the director found a street with a warehouse on the lower floor of a building that used to be an automotive workshop. The crew built a bank set with movable walls, which allowed Lumet to place the cameras as he desired, and to use long lenses to shoot from a distance. The warehouse&#x27;s location also allowed Lumet to transition freely between the bank and the street, and he avoided changing film locations, and allowed the street to be visible from the inside of the bank. The scenes were shot on Prospect Park West, between 17th and 18th streets. The bus line that ran through the street was re-routed for filming, and the second storey of the building housed the production offices and catering.
To capture Pacino&#x27;s movements in a natural fashion, and to allow the actor greater mobility, Lumet integrated the use of roller skates and wheelchairs for the cameramen in the panoramic shots. Lumet would order the camera operators to be pulled as Pacino acted to make the scene look &quot;naturalistic&quot;, and &quot;like it was shot by television cameramen, fighting their way through the crowd&quot;. He wanted the production to have the appearance of a newsreel. The film featured close-ups centered on Sonny and the situation in the bank.

Two different cameras were used to cover the negotiations from Durning and Pacino&#x27;s side. Lumet and cinematographer Victor J. Kemper relied on long shots to depict the point of view of the police, and the robbers&#x27; &quot;entrapment&quot;. Lumet wanted to use the light available on the set to avoid additional luminescence. He fitted the bank with extra fluorescent lamps to achieve desired exposure, and he used other fluorescent lamps of lower power as fill light in close-ups. The film required seven nights of filming. Lumet needed the neighbors&#x27; cooperation for the use of their fire escapes to hold additional lights. The production was challenged by the weather, as temperatures dropped. On the day of the heist in August 1972, the temperature reached when the robbers entered the bank. The film was shot during the fall; to avoid having their breath be visible, the cast placed ice in their mouths to even out the temperature. Lighting was provided for the scenes by emergency vehicles, that were specially fitted with four 7,500 watt lamps. The white brick façade of the building provided light reflection. An existing lamp post was utilized, and its lighting reinforced to keep the crowd visible. Emergency lights were used on set in scenes where the power was shut off by the police.

Pacino shot the first scene wearing sunglasses, but he asked the director to re-shoot it after watching the dailies, as he felt that Sonny &quot;wanted to get caught&quot;. He also shaved off a moustache he grew for the role after the replay. Lumet allowed the cast to ad-lib lines with the condition that they did not deviate greatly from the script by Pierson. The production team had recorded improvisations during the rehearsals that were added to the script. Lumet wanted the dialog to &quot;feel natural&quot;, and he encouraged the actors to wear their own clothes and to not use makeup.

A crowd of three to four hundred extras was hired. Meanwhile, Lumet asked the neighbors to appear in the film by watching from their windows. The director offered to relocate to a hotel for those who did not want to be disturbed by the shooting. The crowd grew as filming progressed, and pedestrians joined the actors. Lumet directed the crowd and &quot;whipp[ed] them up to a frenzy&quot;. By the second week, he felt that the crowd could improvise on its own. To amplify the effect in the film, he utilized hand-held cameras. In regards to the project while it was filming, Lumet said &quot;It&#x27;s out of my hands. It&#x27;s got a life of its own&quot;. In a scene on the street, before Pacino left the bank, assistant director Burtt Harris whispered to him to ask the crowd about Attica. Pacino then improvised the complete dialog with the crowd.

==== Phone conversations ====
Lumet decided to shoot the phone conversations Sonny had with his wife and Leon back-to-back. As Pacino acted the scene, he increased the intensity of the portrayal. While both conversations lasted a total of fourteen minutes, Lumet&#x27;s camera could only shoot ten at a time, and he had to bring a second camera. For the scene, Lumet separated Pacino from the rest of the bank with a black velvet mask to isolate him. He left a hole for both cameras, and for himself to look in. Lumet wanted a second take. An exhausted Pacino accepted, and he kept the same intensity. At the end of the scene, Lumet and Pacino cried. The director later remembered it as &quot;an amazing moment, as good a moment of directing as I&#x27;ve ever had in my life&quot;.

The call between Pacino and Sarandon was improvised. Lumet felt that Sarandon &quot;had great taste&quot;, and that the actor would not resort to &quot;homosexual clichés&quot;. He deemed the humor of his improvisation as &quot;genuinely funny&quot;, and that it was not &quot;laughing at a gay character&quot;. Sarandon felt that the conversation was welcomed by the audiences because it &quot;wasn&#x27;t about a drag queen and his boyfriend&quot;, and that it reflected two people that were &quot;trying to come to grips with what is wrong in their relationship.&quot; The film was characterized by its &quot;light comic touch&quot;, and according to critic David Thomson, for its &quot;ear and instinct for comedy&quot;. In Pierson&#x27;s script, Wortzik&#x27;s question regarding which country Sal wanted to escape to did not have a scripted response, but Cazale improvised by answering &quot;Wyoming&quot;. Lumet had to cover his mouth, as he nearly interrupted the scene by laughing.

==== Final scene ====
The start of the final scene at the bank was shot on a night with wind. Pacino was sprinkled with water to simulate sweat; Lumet mixed the artificial sweat himself, as he felt that the makeup crews often used it in excess, or that it was insufficient. The director used a mixture of glycerin and water that he learned to make during the shooting of &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;. The mixture lasted longer and allowed him better continuity throughout the scenes.

Harris directed the scene of the caravan that headed to Kennedy Airport from a helicopter. A plane and squad cars on the tarmac were used. Senator Jacob Javits, an acquaintance of Lumet, facilitated the negotiations with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The production team was given one day to shoot in an area of the airport that was not a terminal. The international flights that headed to the main runway had to go around the shooting location. Lumet directed the scene at the airport from the ground. He chose to cut from the close-up after Sal was shot and a gun was held to Sonny&#x27;s head, to a long shot; the view presented a panorama of the scene at the airport. Lumet centered on Pacino and ordered the crew to roll Cazale on a stretcher to be visible by the actor. Pacino used the image to improvise his reaction.
The shooting was completed three weeks ahead of schedule. After editing the film, Lumet and Allen felt that the slow-paced scene of Sonny &#x27;dictating&#x27; his will/testament conflicted with the rest of the fast-moving sequences, so they decided to restore six to seven minutes of discarded footage to balance the tempo of the film. Lumet stated the scene of the last will was the reason for his decision to work on the film; he considered it &quot;moving&quot;, but worried about the audience laughing at it. His worries were based on what he considered &quot;the defensive attitude on sexual subjects&quot;: to avoid it, he focused on portraying emotional performances by the actors throughout the film. Lumet had access to the footage of Wojtowicz and Eden&#x27;s ceremony, originally broadcast by Channel 5 at the time of the robbery, which featured Wojtowicz in his army uniform presenting a wedding ring with a flash cube to Eden, who wore a wedding dress. Wojtowicz&#x27;s mother and eight male bridesmaids were present. Lumet planned to use it in the film; the scene would have featured the footage broadcast on a television in the bank, but he decided not to include it, as he felt it would be &quot;unrecoverable&quot; and that the audiences would not &quot;take the rest of the movie seriously&quot;.

== Release and reception ==
&quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; opened on September 20, 1975, at the San Sebastián International Film Festival. The film premiered in New York City on September 21, 1975, and released nationwide in October. It grossed between $50 million (equivalent to $ million in ) and $56 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

&quot;The New York Times&quot; delivered a favorable review. It called the film a &quot;gaudy street-carnival&quot;, and Lumet&#x27;s &quot;most accurate, most flamboyant&quot; depiction of New York. The reviewer remarked the &quot;brilliant characterizations&quot; of the cast: Pacino&#x27;s display of a &quot;bravura style&quot;, Sarandon&#x27;s performance of &quot;fear, dignity and silliness&quot; and the acting &quot;that one remembers&quot; from the supporting cast. &quot;New York Daily News&quot; gave &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; four stars: it described the film as a &quot;gut-level human comedy&quot; and called Pacino &quot;stunning&quot;, &quot;brilliantly erratic and terribly touching&quot;. The publication felt that Pacino portrayed &quot;a rich, volatile character&quot;. It favored Durning and Sarandon, and called the female cast &quot;marvelous&quot;. &quot;The Record&quot; welcomed the performances as &quot;very natural&quot;. It determined that &quot;all the slickness&quot; was on Pierson&#x27;s script, and it attributed it to its closeness to the real events portrayed on the film. For &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, critic Andrew Sarris opined that Pacino acted &quot;assiduously with the whites of his eyes&quot;. Sarris also noted that &quot;pain [came] pouring out of Pacino&#x27;s eyes&quot; as he deemed Sonny a &quot;Freudian tragic hero&quot;, and that the combination with Cazale&#x27;s character&#x27;s &quot;deadpan death wish&quot; produced &quot;much emotional debris&quot;. The piece declared the &quot;high point&quot; of the film to be the phone conversation between Pacino and Sarandon. Sarris pointed that the dialogue featured &quot;two wounded creatures capable of an extraordinary emotional audacity&quot;, and concluded that the film was to be &quot;seen, but not swallowed whole&quot; and &quot;making heroes out of felons&quot; was &quot;a short step to utter chaos&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert rated it with three-and-a-half stars out of four, welcoming its &quot;irreverent, quirky sense of humor&quot;. Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a triumphant new classic of American movie naturalism&quot;. Penelope Gilliatt of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;Though the farcical tone of the movie is blusterous, falling into the common show-biz habit of supplying energy in place of intent, the movie succeeds, on the whole, because it has the crucial farcical value of not faltering.&quot;

Gene Siskel gave &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; four stars on his review for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and rated the film as &quot;superb&quot;, noting the &quot;scenes mixing the fear of violence with insane laughter&quot;. He felt that Pacino, Cazale, and Durning kept the film from &quot;degenerating into silliness&quot;. Siskel talked about Pacino&#x27;s display of &quot;so much energy&quot; that made him &quot;believe the unbelievable&quot; and Cazale&#x27;s &quot;haunting, sallow-cheeked silence&quot;. Lumet and Allen were praised for the &quot;terrific, roller-coaster&quot; pace of the film. United Press International defined it as an &quot;exceptionally fine film—outrageously funny and deeply moving&quot;, and welcomed Pacino&#x27;s acting as a &quot;dazzing display&quot;. The supporting roles by Cazale, Durning, Allen and Broderick were deemed &quot;excellent&quot;, while Peretz and Sarandon&#x27;s performances were singled out. For Joe Baltake, Pacino&#x27;s appearance was a &quot;raw, high voltage, uproariously funny performance&quot;. His review on the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; continued by calling the film &quot;super-charged&quot;, and &quot;multi-leveled&quot; by &quot;a slapstick comedy, tense drama, caper tale, biographical material and character study&quot;. Baltake compared Cazale&#x27;s appearance on the film to that of a &quot;Coonskin&quot; character by Ralph Bakshi. In regards to the rest of the cast, he determined &quot;everyone [was] good&quot;. He praised Kemper&#x27;s cinematography as &quot;you-are-there&quot; and Allen&#x27;s &quot;razor-sharp editing&quot;.

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; praised Lumet&#x27;s &quot;wonderful&quot; direction of &quot;in-depth, psychological probing&quot;. Critic Kevin Kelly hailed the editing by Allen as &quot;brilliant&quot;, and defined Pacino&#x27;s performance as &quot;virtuose&quot; and Cazele&#x27;s as &quot;shyly and sorrowfully eloquent&quot;. The review also favored the &quot;fine performances&quot; by the supporting cast. &quot;The Evening Sun&quot; applauded the humor in the movie. Critic Lou Cedrone felt that it was &quot;natural and true&quot;; he stressed that Pierson&#x27;s script, combined with the work of Pacino and Lumet, made the drama &quot;never uncomfortable&quot;. The &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; expressed that the picture relied on Pacino&#x27;s &quot;tender, forthright, generous and affecting in extreme&quot; performance.

The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; praised &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; as &quot;a movie of fascinating realism&quot;. Critic John Huddy expressed that the street scenes were &quot;magnificently staged&quot;, and that Lumet &quot;finds order in chaos, sense in insanity&quot;. &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; applauded Durning as &quot;absolutely real&quot;, and the reviewer opined that the cast was &quot;consistently fine&quot;. It concluded by mentioning &quot;the excellent script and editing&quot;, and defined the film as &quot;funny and poignant&quot;.

The &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; mentioned the variety of characters presented in the film. The reviewer concluded that it was &quot;a monument to the thought and care&quot; by the production team. Pacino&#x27;s &quot;remarkable performance&quot;, and Pierson&#x27;s &quot;all-inclusive&quot; script were noted. &quot;The Guardian&quot; opined that &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; presented Lumet&#x27;s &quot;best film for some considerable time&quot;, and deemed Pacino&#x27;s acting as &quot;brilliant&quot; and Cazale&#x27;s as &quot;well-observed&quot;. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; considered it &quot;beautifully directed&quot; by Lumet, and &quot;another mature American picture which faces and mirrors reality&quot;.

=== Lawsuits ===
Wojtowicz&#x27;s wife, Carmen, received $50 () from Artists Entertainment Complex for her contribution to the story. She signed the documents to Wicker, who recorded in exchange a tape with her account on behalf of the company. The depiction of her character, Angie, in the film affected her, as she felt she was deemed &quot;repulsive&quot;. The novelization of &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; described her as &quot;a fat cunt&quot;, &quot;no-good pusbag&quot; and a &quot;guinea broad&quot;, among other pejorative terms. In the film, Angie laments her weight gain as the reason for Sonny&#x27;s distance. Wojtowicz was also angered by her depiction in the film, and defined his then-wife as &quot;a sweet kid&quot;. Pierson declared that the character was presented &quot;farthest from the truth&quot;, and that he could not &quot;stand how [Lumet] casted the role&quot;, or how Peretz portrayed her. He further stressed his disappointment at the publicity campaign that presented the film as a &quot;true story&quot;, and remarked its differences with the &quot;Life&quot; article. Pierson presented a complaint to the Writers Guild of America. Kluge, a coauthor of the &quot;Life&quot; feature, believed the film-makers &quot;stayed with the surface of a lively journalistic story&quot; and that the film had a &quot;strong, fast-paced story&quot; without &quot;reflection&quot; or &quot;a contemplative view of life&quot;.

Carmen took legal action against Warner Bros. On behalf of her, and her daughters Carmen and Dawn, Wojtowicz filed a lawsuit alleging invasion of privacy and requesting $12,000,000 in damages. The appellate division of the New York Supreme Court ruled in favor of Warner Bros, as the court determined that the true names or pictures of the family and robbers were not used in the film or the book. Wojtowicz then sued the studio for 1% of the earnings he claimed were included in the deal for the use of his story; he received $40,000 () after lawyer&#x27;s fees were deducted. The New York Supreme Court ordered that $100 () were to be given weekly to Carmen Wojtowicz, plus $50 weekly for both children. The rest of the money was placed in escrow of the New York State Crime Victims Compensation Board to pay for the claims of the victims of the 1972 robbery.

== Legacy ==
Analysis in the 21st century of &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; has interpreted it as an &quot;anti-authoritarian film&quot; that &quot;defied the establishment,&quot; particularly with the emphasis on the Attica Prison riot and the character&#x27;s resentment toward the police. Commentators also mentioned its contemporaneity with the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal. It became one of the first motion pictures to portray a bisexual male character as the protagonist. In 2009, &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress, and it was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

On November 11, 1979, a censored and shortened version was broadcast on NBC&#x27;s Sunday Night Big Event, which marked the film&#x27;s television premiere. It was released on VHS in 1985. In 2006, Warner Home Video released &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; on a double-disc DVD. For the film&#x27;s fortieth anniversary, a two-disc blu-ray was released in 2015. Meanwhile, 

AllMovie gave the movie five stars out of five. The review defined it as &quot;a quintessential 1970s story&quot;, and focused on the film&#x27;s &quot;contemporary tensions over law, media, and sexuality&quot;. Christopher Null wrote in 2006 that the film &quot;captures perfectly the zeitgeist of the early 1970s, a time when optimism was scraping rock bottom and John Wojtowicz was as good a hero as we could come up with&quot;. During the 2011 San Francisco International Film Festival, the film was included as a tribute to Pierson for his recent death. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reflected on the time of its release, and the reviewer felt that &quot;it seemed as if the great movies would never stop, when the extraordinary creative burst we&#x27;d been seeing in the 1970s looked as though it might go on forever&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called it a &quot;frank social melodrama that&#x27;s also a celebration of quotidian bravery&quot;, while it praised the cinematography by Kemper that &quot;captures the joy as well as the decay of a crowded city&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; delivered a good review, and considered Pacino&#x27;s performance to be &quot;spectacular, and achieves a kind of nuance and complexity that few actors from his or any other generation have before or since achieved&quot;. Meanwhile, the reviewer considered that the movie displayed the reason Cazale was &quot;one of the great character actors of all time&quot;.

=== In popular culture ===
The 1977 Italian film &quot;Operazione Kappa: sparate a vista&quot; was loosely based on &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;. The 1987 Hong Kong action film &quot;Yan man ying hung&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Hero&quot;) was a remake of the film. For his audition on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, actor Hank Azaria used an imitation voice based on Pacino&#x27;s &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; character. It was the basis for the final voice of Moe Szyslak. A bank robbery featuring Sonny and Sal was featured on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; episode &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot;. In 2006, Marcia Jean Kurtz and Lionel Pina reprised their &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; roles as Miriam Douglas and a pizza delivery man in the heist thriller film &quot;Inside Man&quot;.

The names of several television series episodes referenced the film, including &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot;, &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;, &quot;The New Lassie&quot;, &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, and &quot;2 Broke Girls&quot;. The shout &quot;Attica! Attica!&quot; was also reproduced in multiple films and television series.

== Accolades ==
&quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; was nominated for six Academy Awards. Pierson received the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The film was nominated for seven Golden Globes but won none. It received six British Academy Film Awards nominations: Pacino was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Allen won the Best Editing. Pierson also received the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written Drama, and Durning the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor. At the San Sebastián International Film Festival Pacino won Best Actor, while the movie was nominated for Best Film.

The film ranked at number seventy on AFI&#x27;s &quot;100 Years... 100 Thrills&quot; list. Meanwhile, the line &quot;Attica! Attica!&quot; placed at number eighty-six on &quot;100 Years...100 Movie Quotes&quot;. It was nominated for &quot;100 Years...100 Movies&quot; in 1998 and 2007. In 2006, &quot;Premiere&quot; issued its &quot;100 Greatest Performances of All Time&quot;. The magazine placed Pacino&#x27;s performance as Sonny as the fourth-greatest ever. In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; as the twentieth best edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership.

<text>The Maotianshan Shales () are a series of Early Cambrian sedimentary deposits in the Chiungchussu Formation, famous for their &quot;Konservat Lagerstätten&quot;, deposits known for the exceptional preservation of fossilized organisms or traces. The Maotianshan Shales form one of some forty Cambrian fossil locations worldwide exhibiting exquisite preservation of rarely preserved, non-mineralized soft tissue, comparable to the fossils of the Burgess Shale of British Columbia, Canada. They take their name from Maotianshan Hill () in Chengjiang County, Yunnan Province, China.

The most famous assemblage of organisms are referred to as the Chengjiang biota for the multiple scattered fossil sites in Chengjiang. The age of the Chengjiang Lagerstätte is locally termed Qiongzhusian, a stage correlated to the late Atdabanian Stage in Siberian sequences of the middle of the Early Cambrian.
The shales date to ≤.

Along with the Burgess Shale, the Maotianshan Shales are remarked as &quot;our best window into the Cambrian &#x27;explosion&#x27;&quot;, especially on the origin of chordates.

== History and scientific significance ==
Although fossils from the region have been known from the early part of the 10th century, Chengjiang was first recognized for its exquisite states of preservation with the 1984 discovery of the naraoiid &quot;Misszhouia&quot;, a soft-bodied relative of trilobites. Since then, the locality has been intensively studied by scientists throughout the world, yielding a constant flow of new discoveries and triggering an extensive scientific debate surrounding the interpretation of discoveries. Over this time, taxa have been revised or reassigned to different groups. Interpretations have led to many refinements of the phylogeny of groups and even the erection of the new phylum Vetulicolia of primitive deuterostomes.

The Chengjiang biota has all the animal groups found in the Burgess Shale; however, since it is ten million years older, it more strongly supports the deduction that metazoans diversified earlier or faster in the early Cambrian than does the Burgess Shale fauna alone. The preservation of an extremely diverse faunal assemblage renders the Maotianshan shale the world&#x27;s most important for understanding the evolution of early multi-cellular life, particularly the members of phylum Chordata, which includes all vertebrates. The Chengjiang fossils comprise the oldest diverse metazoan assemblage above the Proterozoic-Phanerozoic transition and, thus, the fossil record&#x27;s best data source for understanding the apparently rapid diversification of life known as the Cambrian Explosion.

One of the most intriguing locations of the Chengjiang biota is the Haiyan Lagerstätte where hundreds of juvenile specimens have been found. This unique location offers insights into the development of most animal groups and as such is a unique deposit in the Cambrian.

===IUGS geological heritage site===
In respect of &#x27;the Chengjiang fossils represent[ing] an uparalleled record of the fundamentally important rapid diversification of metazoan life in the early Cambrian&#x27;, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) included the &#x27;Cambrian Chengjiang fossil site and lagerstätte&#x27; in its assemblage of 100 &#x27;geological heritage sites&#x27; around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an &#x27;IUGS Geological Heritage Site&#x27; as &#x27;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.&#x27;

== Preservation and taphonomy ==
The fossils occur in a section of mudstone thick in the Yuanshan Member of the Qiongzhusi Formation. The Yuanshan Member is extensive, covering multiple of eastern Yunnan Province, where there are many scattered outcrops yielding fossils. Studies of the strata are consistent with a tropical environment with sea level changes and tectonic activity. The region is believed to have been a shallow sea with a muddy bottom. The preserved fauna is primarily benthic and was likely buried by periodic turbidity currents, since most fossils do not show evidence of post-mortem transport. Like the younger Burgess Shale fossils, the paleo-environment enabled preservation of non-mineralized, soft body parts. Fossils are found in thin layers less than an inch thick. The soft parts are preserved as aluminosilicate films, often with high oxidized iron content and often exhibiting exquisite details.

The Chengjiang beds are very deeply weathered, as evidenced by their low specific gravity (i.e., they are very lightweight). Trace fossils are abundant.

== Chengjiang fauna ==
The Chengjiang biota comprises an extremely diverse faunal assembly, with some 185 species described in the literature as of June 2006. Of these, nearly half are arthropods, few of which had the hard, mineral-reinforced exoskeletons characteristic of all later arthropoda; only about 3% of the organisms known from Chengjiang have hard shells. Most of those are the trilobites (of which there are five species), all of which have been found with traces of legs, antennae, and other soft body parts, an exceedingly rare occurrence in the fossil record. Phylum Porifera (sponges; 15 species) and Priapulida (16 species) are also well represented. Other phyla represented are Brachiopoda, Chaetognatha, Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Echinodermata, Hyolitha, Nematomorpha, Phoronida, and Chordata. Possible molluscs include &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; and &quot;Nectocaris&quot;.

About one in eight animals are problematic forms of uncertain affinity, some of which may have been evolutionary experiments that survived for only a brief period as benthic environments rapidly changed in the Cambrian. Chengjiang is the richest source of the Lobopodia, a group including many early panarthropods, with six genera represented: &quot;Luolishania&quot;, &quot;Paucipodia&quot;, &quot;Cardiodictyon&quot;,&quot; Hallucigenia&quot; (also known from the Burgess Shale), &quot;Microdictyon&quot;, and &quot;Onychodictyon&quot;.

Perhaps the most important fossils from Chengjiang are eight possible members of phylum Chordata, the phylum to which all vertebrates belong. The most famous is &quot;Myllokunmingia&quot;, possibly a very primitive agnathid (i.e., jawless fish). Similar to &quot;Myllokunmingia&quot; is &quot;Haikouichthys ercaicunensis&quot;, another primitive fish-like animal.

A wide range of affinities have been proposed for the enigmatic &quot;Yunnanozoon lividum&quot; including stem cephalochordates, stem or crown hemichordates, craniates, stem deuterostomes, stem bilaterians, or ambulacrarians. Specimens initially identified as &quot;Haikouella&quot; (a genus later deemed a junior synonym of &quot;Yunnanozoon&quot;) display has several chordate features, including a discernible heart, dorsal and ventral aorta, gill filaments, and a notochord (neural chord). A 2024 study placed &quot;Yunnanozoon&quot; along the chordate stem.

Another much-debated group is the Vetulicolia, starting with the discovery of &quot;Vetulicola&quot; in 1987. Close Chengjiang relatives of &quot;Vetulicola&quot; include &quot;Beidazoon&quot; and the Didazoonids. &quot;Heteromorphus&quot; is more closely related to &quot;Banffia&quot; from the Burgess Shale, but both it and &quot;Banffia&quot; are also considered to be vetulicolians. Originally described as crustacean arthropods, the &quot;Vetulicola&quot; were later erected as a new phylum of primitive deuterostomes by D.G. Shu. In recent years, a majority of workers have come to see the vetulicolians as stem chordates, and a 2024 study placed vetulicolians as a basal chordate evolutionary grade, followed by &quot;Yunnanozoon&quot;. An alternative proposal places vetulicolians as a sister group to tunicates. Vetulicolians are thought to have been swimmers that either were filter feeders or detritivores.

Some two dozen animals from the Chengjiang biota are problematic regarding phylogenetic assignment. Among these, &quot;&#x27;Anomalocaris&#x27; saron&quot;, the alleged predatory terror of the early Cambrian, was the most famous, although that species is later reclassified to &quot;Houcaris saron&quot; and &quot;Innovatiocaris maotianshanensis&quot;. Shu (2006) recently described &quot;Stromatoveris psygmoglena&quot; as a possible bilateran missing link between Ediacaran fronds and Cambrian ctenophores. &quot;Cambrocornulitus&quot; had a tubicolous shell which probably was biomineralized. It shares some affinities with cornulitids and lophophorates.

The Chengjiang biota is believed to have inhabited a delta front environment rich in oxygen, with high sedimentation rates and major fluctuations in salinity being the main environmental stressors.

== Guanshan biota ==
Located in the Yunnan Province of South China and hosted in the geologically distinct Cambrian Stage 4 Wulongqing Formation, The Guanshan biota are also Burgess shale-type fossils but slightly younger than the Chengjian biota with an age dating to 515–510 Myr. Brachiopods are the most abundant species, followed by trilobites. Other species belong to sponges, chancelloriids, cnidarians, ctenophores, priapulids, lobopodians, arthropods, anomalocaridids, hyoliths, molluscs, brachiopods, echinoderms, algae and vetulicolians. There are also the earliest-known eocrinoids, unidentified soft-bodied animals and abundant trace fossils.

The Guanshan biota are regarded as successors of the Chengjian biota, and share many species. The unique species include arthropods like &quot;Guangweicaris&quot; and &quot;Astutuscaris,&quot; vetulicolians like &quot;Vetulicola gantoucunensis&quot; and &quot;V. longbaoshanensis&quot;.; chordates like &quot;Cathaymyrus haikouensis&quot; and &quot;Zhongxiniscus intermedius.&quot;

<text>, better known as Encyclopédie (), was a general encyclopedia published in France between 1751 and 1772, with later supplements, revised editions, and translations. It had many writers, known as the Encyclopédistes. It was edited by Denis Diderot and, until 1759, co-edited by Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert.

The &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; is most famous for representing the thought of the Enlightenment. According to Denis Diderot in the article &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; aim was &quot;to change the way people think&quot; and for people to be able to inform themselves and to know things. He and the other contributors advocated for the secularization of learning away from the Jesuits. Diderot wanted to incorporate all of the world&#x27;s knowledge into the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; and hoped that the text could disseminate all this information to the public and future generations. Thus, it is an example of democratization of knowledge.

It was also the first encyclopedia to include contributions from many named contributors, and it was the first general encyclopedia to describe the mechanical arts. In the first publication, seventeen folio volumes were accompanied by detailed engravings. Later volumes were published without the engravings, in order to better reach a wide audience within Europe.

==Origins==

The &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; was originally conceived as a French translation of Ephraim Chambers&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; (1728). Ephraim Chambers had first published his &quot;Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences&quot; in two volumes in London in 1728, following several dictionaries of arts and sciences that had emerged in Europe since the late 17th century. This work became quite renowned, and four editions were published between 1738 and 1742. An Italian translation appeared between 1747 and 1754. In France a member of the banking family Lambert had started translating Chambers into French, but in 1745 the expatriate Englishman John Mills and German Gottfried Sellius were the first to actually prepare a French edition of Ephraim Chambers&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; for publication, which they entitled &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;.

Early in 1745 a prospectus for the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; was published to attract subscribers to the project. This four page prospectus was illustrated by Jean-Michel Papillon, and accompanied by a plan, stating that the work would be published in five volumes from June 1746 until the end of 1748. The text was translated by Mills and Sellius, and it was corrected by an unnamed person, who appears to have been Denis Diderot.

The prospectus was reviewed quite positively and cited at some length in several journals. The &quot;Mémoires pour l&#x27;histoire des sciences et des beaux arts&quot; journal was lavish in its praise: &quot;here are two of the greatest efforts undertaken in literature in a very long time&quot; (&quot;voici deux des plus fortes entreprises de Littérature qu&#x27;on ait faites depuis long-temps&quot;). The &quot;Mercure Journal&quot; in June 1745, printed a 25-page article that specifically praised Mills&#x27; role as translator; the &quot;Journal&quot; introduced Mills as an English scholar who had been raised in France and who spoke both French and English as a native. The &quot;Journal&quot; reported that Mills had discussed the work with several academics, was zealous about the project, had devoted his fortune to support this enterprise, and was the sole owner of the publishing privilege.

However, the cooperation fell apart later on in 1745. André le Breton, the publisher commissioned to manage the physical production and sales of the volumes, cheated Mills out of the subscription money, claiming for example that Mills&#x27;s knowledge of French was inadequate. In a confrontation Le Breton physically assaulted Mills. Mills took Le Breton to court, but the court decided in Le Breton&#x27;s favour. Mills returned to England soon after the court&#x27;s ruling. For his new editor, Le Breton settled on the mathematician Jean Paul de Gua de Malves. Among those hired by Malves were the young Étienne Bonnot de Condillac, Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert, and Denis Diderot. Within thirteen months, in August 1747, Gua de Malves was fired for being an ineffective leader. Le Breton then hired Diderot and d&#x27;Alembert to be the new editors. Diderot would remain as editor for the next 25 years, seeing the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; through to its completion; d&#x27;Alembert would leave this role in 1758. As d&#x27;Alembert worked on the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, its title expanded. As of 1750, the full title was &quot;Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, par une société de gens de lettres, mis en ordre par M. Diderot de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences et Belles-Lettres de Prusse, et quant à la partie mathématique, par M. d&#x27;Alembert de l&#x27;Académie royale des Sciences de Paris, de celle de Prusse et de la Société royale de Londres.&quot; (&quot;Encyclopedia: or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts, by a Company of Persons of Letters, edited by M. Diderot of the Academy of Sciences and &quot;Belles-lettres&quot; of Prussia: as to the Mathematical Portion, arranged by M. d&#x27;Alembert of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris, of the Academy of Sciences in Prussia and of the Royal Society of London.&quot;) The title page was amended as d&#x27;Alembert acquired more titles.

==Publication==

The work consisted of 28 volumes, with 71,818 articles and 3,129 illustrations. The first seventeen volumes were published between 1751 and 1765; eleven volumes of plates were finished by 1772. Engraver Robert Bénard provided at least 1,800 plates for the work. The &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; sold 4,000 copies during its first twenty years of publication and earned a profit of 2 million livres for its investors. Because of its occasional radical contents, the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; caused much controversy in conservative circles, and after the publication of the second volume, it was briefly suspended from publishing by royal edict of 1752. Joly de Fleury accused it of &quot;destroying royal authority, fomenting a spirit of Independence and revolt, and...laying the foundations of an edifice of error, for the corruption of morals and religion, and the promotion of unbelief.&quot;

Following the publication of the seventh volume, on the initiative of the Parlement of Paris, the French government suspended the encyclopedia&#x27;s &quot;privilège&quot; in 1759. Despite these issues, work continued &quot;in secret,&quot; partially because the project had highly placed supporters, such as Malesherbes and Madame de Pompadour. The authorities deliberately ignored the continued work; they thought their official ban was sufficient to appease the church and other enemies of the project.

During the &quot;secretive&quot; period, Diderot accomplished a work of subterfuge. The title pages of volumes 1 through 7, published between 1751 and 1757, claimed Paris as the place of publication. However, the title pages of the subsequent text volumes, 8 through 17, published together in 1765, show &quot;Neufchastel&quot; as the place of publication. Neuchâtel is safely across the French border in what is now part of Switzerland but which was then an independent principality, where official production of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; was secure from interference by agents of the French state. In particular, regime opponents of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; could not seize the production plates for the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; in Paris because those printing plates ostensibly existed only in Switzerland. Meanwhile, the actual production of volumes 8 through 17 quietly continued in Paris.

In 1775, Charles Joseph Panckoucke obtained the rights to reissue the work. He issued five volumes of supplementary material and a two-volume index from 1776 to 1780. Some scholars include these seven &quot;extra&quot; volumes as part of the first full issue of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, for a total of 35 volumes, although they were not written or edited by the original authors.

From 1782 to 1832, Panckoucke and his successors published an expanded edition of the work in some 166 volumes as the &quot;Encyclopédie Méthodique&quot;. That work, enormous for its time, occupied a thousand workers in production and 2,250 contributors.

==Contributors==
Since the objective of the editors of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; was to gather all the knowledge in the world, Diderot and D&#x27;Alembert knew they would need various contributors to help them with their project. Many of the philosophes (intellectuals of the French Enlightenment) contributed to the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, including Diderot himself, Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montesquieu. The most prolific contributor was Louis de Jaucourt, who wrote 17,266 articles between 1759 and 1765, or about eight per day, representing a full 25% of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;.

The publication became a place where these contributors could share their ideas and interests, still, as Frank Kafker has argued, the Encyclopedists were not a unified group:

Following is a list of notable contributors with their area of contribution (for a more detailed list, see Encyclopédistes):

*Jean Le Rond d&#x27;Alembert – editor; science (especially mathematics), contemporary affairs, philosophy, religion, among others
*Claude Bourgelat – manège, farriery
*André le Breton – chief publisher; article on printer&#x27;s ink
*Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton – natural history
*Denis Diderot – chief editor; economics, mechanical arts, philosophy, politics, religion, among others
*Baron d&#x27;Holbach – science (chemistry, mineralogy), politics, religion, among others
*Chevalier Louis de Jaucourt – economics, literature, medicine, politics, bookbinding, among others
*Jean-Baptiste de La Chapelle – mathematics
*Abbé André Morellet – theology, philosophy
*Montesquieu – part of the article &quot;Goût&quot; (&quot;Taste&quot;)
*François Quesnay – articles on tax farmers and grain
*Jean-Jacques Rousseau – music, political theory
*Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune – economics, etymology, philosophy, physics
*Voltaire – history, literature, philosophy

Due to the controversial nature of some of the articles, several of its editors were sent to jail.

== Contents and controversies ==

===Structure===
 Like most encyclopedias, the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; attempted to collect and summarize human knowledge in a variety of fields and topics, ranging from philosophy to theology to science and the arts. The &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; was controversial for reorganizing knowledge based on human reason instead of by nature or theology. Knowledge and intellect branched from the three categories of human thought, whereas all other perceived aspects of knowledge, including theology, were simply branches or components of these human-made categories. The introduction to the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s &quot;Preliminary Discourse&quot;, is considered an important exposition of Enlightenment ideals. Among other things, it presents a taxonomy of human knowledge (see Fig. 3), which was inspired by Francis Bacon&#x27;s &quot;The Advancement of Learning&quot;. The three main branches of knowledge are: &quot;Memory&quot;/History, &quot;Reason&quot;/Philosophy, and &quot;Imagination&quot;/Poetry. This tree of knowledge was created to help readers evaluate the usefulness of the content within the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, and to organize its content. Notable is the fact that theology is ordered under &quot;philosophy&quot; and that &quot;Knowledge of God&quot; is only a few nodes away from &quot;divination&quot; and &quot;black magic&quot;.

===Religious and political controversies===
The authors of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; challenged religious authority. The authors, especially Diderot and d&#x27;Alembert, located religion within a system of reason and philosophy. They did not reject all religious claims, but believed theology and notions of God must be proven. Louis de Jaucourt therefore harshly criticized superstition as an intellectual error in his article on the topic. The writers further doubted the authenticity of presupposed historical events cited in the Bible and questioned the validity of miracles, such as the Resurrection. However, some contemporary scholars argue the skeptical view of miracles in the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; may be interpreted in terms of &quot;Protestant debates about the cessation of the charismata.&quot;

These challenges led to suppression from church and state authorities. The &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; and its contributors endured many attacks and attempts at censorship by the clergy or other censors, which threatened the publication of the project as well as the authors themselves. The King&#x27;s Council suppressed the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; in 1759. The Catholic Church, under Pope Clement XIII, placed it on its list of banned books. Prominent intellectuals criticized it, most famously Lefranc de Pompignan at the French Academy. A playwright, Charles Palissot de Montenoy, wrote a play called &quot;Les Philosophes&quot; to criticize the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;. When Abbé André Morellet, one of the contributors to the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, wrote a mock preface for it, he was sent to the Bastille due to allegations of libel.

To defend themselves from controversy, the encyclopedia&#x27;s articles wrote of theological topics in a mixed manner. Some articles supported orthodoxy, and some included overt criticisms of Christianity. To avoid direct retribution from censors, writers often hid criticism in obscure articles or expressed it in ironic terms. Nonetheless, the contributors still openly attacked the Catholic Church in certain articles with examples including criticizing excess festivals, monasteries, and celibacy of the clergy.

===Politics and society===
The &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; is often seen as an influence for the French Revolution because of its emphasis on Enlightenment political theories. Diderot and other authors, in famous articles such as &quot;Political Authority&quot;, emphasized the shift of the origin of political authority from divinity or heritage to the people. This Enlightenment ideal, espoused by Rousseau and others, advocated that people have the right to consent to their government in a form of social contract.

Another major, contentious component of political issues in the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; was personal or natural rights. Articles such as &quot;Natural Rights&quot; by Diderot explained the relationship between individuals and the general will. The natural state of humanity, according to the authors, is barbaric and unorganized. To balance the desires of individuals and the needs of the general will, humanity requires civil society and laws that benefit all persons. Writers, to varying degrees, criticized Thomas Hobbes&#x27; notions of a selfish humanity that requires a sovereign to rule over it.

In terms of economics, the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; expressed favor for laissez-faire ideals or principles of economic liberalism. Articles concerning economics or markets, such as &quot;Economic Politics&quot;, generally favored free competition and denounced monopolies. Articles often criticized guilds as creating monopolies and approved of state intervention to remove such monopolies. The writers advocated extending laissez-faire principles of liberalism from the market to the individual level, such as with privatization of education and opening of careers to all levels of wealth.

===Science and technology===
At the same time, the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; was a vast compendium of knowledge, notably on the technologies of the period, describing the traditional craft tools and processes. Much information was taken from the &quot;Descriptions des Arts et Métiers&quot;. These articles applied a scientific approach to understanding the mechanical and production processes, and offered new ways to improve machines to make them more efficient. Diderot felt that people should have access to &quot;useful knowledge&quot; that they can apply to their everyday life.

==Influence==
The &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; played an important role in the intellectual foment leading to the French Revolution. &quot;No encyclopaedia perhaps has been of such political importance, or has occupied so conspicuous a place in the civil and literary history of its century. It sought not only to give information, but to guide opinion&quot;, wrote the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. In &quot;The Encyclopédie and the Age of Revolution&quot;, a work published in conjunction with a 1989 exhibition of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; at the University of California, Los Angeles, Clorinda Donato writes the following:
While many contributors to the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; had no interest in radically reforming French society, the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; as a whole pointed that way. The &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; denied that the teachings of the Catholic Church could be treated as authoritative in matters of science. The editors also refused to treat the decisions of political powers as definitive in intellectual or artistic questions. Some articles talked about changing social and political institutions that would improve their society for everyone. Given that Paris was the intellectual capital of Europe at the time and that many European leaders used French as their administrative language, these ideas had the capacity to spread.

The &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;″s influence continues today. Historian Dan O&#x27;Sullivan compares it to Wikipedia:

==Statistics==
Approximate size of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;:

* 17 volumes of articles, issued from 1751 to 1765
* 11 volumes of illustrations, issued from 1762 to 1772
* 18,000 pages of text
* 75,000 entries
**44,000 main articles
**28,000 secondary articles
**2,500 illustration indices
* 20,000,000 words in total

Print run: 4,250 copies (note: even single-volume works in the 18th century seldom had a print run of more than 1,500 copies).

==Quotations==
* &quot;The goal of an encyclopedia is to assemble all the knowledge scattered on the surface of the earth, to demonstrate the general system to the people with whom we live, &amp; to transmit it to the people who will come after us, so that the works of centuries past is not useless to the centuries which follow, that our descendants, by becoming more learned, may become more virtuous &amp; happier, &amp; that we do not die without having merited being part of the human race.&quot; (&quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, Diderot)
* &quot;Reason is to the philosopher what grace is to the Christian... Other men walk in darkness; the philosopher, who has the same passions, acts only after reflection; he walks through the night, but it is preceded by a torch. The philosopher forms his principles on an infinity of particular observations. He does not confuse truth with plausibility; he takes for truth what is true, for forgery what is false, for doubtful what is doubtful, and probable what is probable. The philosophical spirit is thus a spirit of observation and accuracy.&quot; (&quot;Philosophers&quot;, Dumarsais)
* &quot;If exclusive privileges were not granted, and if the financial system would not tend to concentrate wealth, there would be few great fortunes and no quick wealth. When the means of growing rich is divided between a greater number of citizens, wealth will also be more evenly distributed; extreme poverty and extreme wealth would be also rare.&quot; (&quot;Wealth&quot;, Diderot)
* &quot;Aguaxima, a plant growing in Brazil and on the islands of South America. This is all that we are told about it; and I would like to know for whom such descriptions are made. It cannot be for the natives of the countries concerned, who are likely to know more about the aguaxima than is contained in this description, and who do not need to learn that the aguaxima grows in their country. It is as if you said to a Frenchman that the pear tree is a tree that grows in France, in Germany, etc. It is not meant for us either, for what do we care that there is a tree in Brazil named aguaxima, if all we know about it is its name? What is the point of giving the name? It leaves the ignorant just as they were and teaches the rest of us nothing. If all the same I mention this plant here, along with several others that are described just as poorly, then it is out of consideration for certain readers who prefer to find nothing in a dictionary article or even to find something stupid than to find no article at all.&quot; (&quot;Aguaxima&quot;, Diderot)

<text>All the President&#x27;s Men is a 1974 non-fiction book by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, two of the journalists who investigated the June 1972 break-in at the Watergate Office Building and the resultant political scandal for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. The book chronicles the investigative reporting of Woodward and Bernstein from Woodward&#x27;s initial report on the Watergate break-in through the resignations of Nixon Administration officials H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman in April 1973, and the revelation of the Oval Office Watergate tapes by Alexander Butterfield three months later. It relates the events behind the major stories the duo wrote for the &quot;Post&quot;, naming some sources who had previously refused to be identified for their initial articles, notably Hugh Sloan. It also gives detailed accounts of Woodward&#x27;s secret meetings with his source Deep Throat, whose identity was kept hidden for over 30 years. Gene Roberts, the former executive editor of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; and former managing editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, has called the work of Woodward and Bernstein &quot;maybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time.&quot;

A film adaptation, starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman as Woodward and Bernstein respectively, was released in 1976. The same year, a sequel to the book, &quot;The Final Days&quot;, was published, which chronicled the last months of Richard Nixon&#x27;s presidency, starting around the time their previous book ended.

== Background ==
Woodward and Bernstein had considered the idea of writing a book about Watergate, but did not commit until actor Robert Redford expressed interest in purchasing the film rights. In &quot;Telling the Truth About Lies: The Making of &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;&quot;, Woodward noted that Redford played an important role in changing the book&#x27;s narrative from a story about the Watergate events to one about their investigations and reportage of the story and was thus successful in transferring the content from one medium and one genre to another (see: media-adequacy).

The name of the book alludes to the nursery rhyme about Humpty Dumpty (&quot;All the king&#x27;s horses and all the king&#x27;s men / Couldn&#x27;t put Humpty together again&quot;). An allusion similar to that was made more explicitly a quarter-century earlier in Robert Penn Warren&#x27;s 1946 novel &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot;, which describes the career of a fictional corrupt governor, loosely based on Huey Long.

== Publication ==
Dick Snyder of Simon &amp; Schuster purchased the right to publish the book through the agent David Obst. The authors received an advance of $55,000. In his memoir, Michael Korda said of the book&#x27;s publication that it &quot;transformed book publishing into a red-hot part of media&quot; and books became &quot;news&quot; instead of history.

Because the book was embargoed until publication day, there were no advance copies for reviewers. Simon &amp; Schuster became known as the &quot;Watergate&quot; publisher by following up &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; with books by John Dean, Maureen Dean, John Ehrlichman and John Mitchell.

<doc id="101927" wikidata="Q533585" url="?curid=101927" title="Bound for Glory (1976 film)">
<text>Bound for Glory is a 1976 American biographical film directed by Hal Ashby and loosely adapted by Robert Getchell from Woody Guthrie&#x27;s 1943 partly fictionalized autobiography &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;. The film stars David Carradine as folk singer Woody Guthrie, with Ronny Cox, Melinda Dillon, Gail Strickland, John Lehne, Ji-Tu Cumbuka and Randy Quaid. Much of the film is based on Guthrie&#x27;s attempt to humanize the desperate Okie Dust Bowl refugees in California during the Great Depression.

&quot;Bound for Glory&quot; was the first motion picture in which inventor/operator Garrett Brown used his new Steadicam for filming moving scenes. Director of photography Haskell Wexler won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography at the 49th Academy Awards.

All of the main events and characters, except for Guthrie and his first wife, Mary, are entirely fictional. The film ends with Guthrie singing his most famous song, &quot;God Blessed America for Me&quot; (subsequently retitled &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;), on his way to New York, but, in fact, the song was composed in New York in 1940 and forgotten by him until five years later.

==Plot==

In 1936, amid the Great Depression, Woody Guthrie performs guitar at a gas station. A customer offers $1 to anyone who can address his worries, and Guthrie succeeds by providing a satisfactory answer. Subsequently, Guthrie begins painting a sign but frustrates his wife, Mary, by abandoning the task—their only reliable source of income—to engage in music instead. At a local bar, Guthrie performs for a woman named Sue Ann and spends the night with her. On his porch, he encounters Heavy Chandler, a recently released mental patient, and encourages him to express his thoughts through painting. After performing at a square dance, a dust storm compels everyone indoors. Guthrie suggests to Mary that he should leave to seek work, and eventually, he departs, leaving her a note.

During his travels, Guthrie rides a train with Slim Snedeger and other hobos. When a fight breaks out, Guthrie and Slim jump to another train; however, railroad enforcers compel those without money to disembark. Slim is able to afford the fare, but Guthrie, being broke, continues on foot, and they part ways. Guthrie later offends a middle-class couple who provide him a ride, leading them to drop him off. In a bar, he earns a meal by playing the piano and spends the night with a waitress. He subsequently rides with a family bound for California, but at the state border, police demand $50 for entry. Guthrie leaves the family and joins a nearby hobo camp. In Los Angeles, he meets Luther and Liz Johnson, a migrant couple struggling to find employment. Upon discovering that jobs are both scarce and poorly compensated, Guthrie offers to paint a sign at a soup kitchen, but his only recompense is a serving of soup.

Later, union organizer Ozark Bule arrives at the camp, performing union songs. When company thugs disrupt the gathering, Guthrie escapes with Ozark, who assists him in obtaining a radio job where Guthrie&#x27;s songs about the working class achieve popularity. However, station owner Mr. Locke insists that Guthrie refrain from singing about unions and instead focus on entertainment. Although Guthrie initially acquiesces, he eventually resumes performing protest songs, resulting in conflict with Locke. Ultimately refusing to compromise, Guthrie is dismissed from his position. He brings Mary and their children to Los Angeles, but he feels out of place amid the wealth surrounding him. Luther, bruised from a beating, informs Guthrie that his songs provide inspiration to the laborers. Frustrated, Guthrie tears up a list of &quot;safe&quot; songs, leaves the studio, and resumes traveling, performing protest songs at migrant camps and factories.

While performing at a fruit-packing plant, Guthrie is assaulted by company enforcers, who destroy his guitar. Undeterred, he continues to travel by train and perform his songs. Upon returning to Los Angeles, Locke extends one final opportunity to Guthrie, but he is terminated once again after dedicating a song to farm workers. As Guthrie departs, Ozark informs him that an agent has arranged a coast-to-coast radio show for him and secured an audition at the prestigious Ambassador Hotel. Guthrie purchases toys for his children, only to discover that Mary and the girls have already left. During the hotel audition, the owner offers him a position but insists on dressing him in overalls and presenting him as part of a hillbilly act. Refusing to cater to the wealthy, Guthrie walks out, returns to the railroad yard, hops on a train, and resumes singing protest songs from the top of a boxcar, remaining true to his roots.

==Production==
Arthur Krim of United Artists agreed to finance the film on the basis of Ashby&#x27;s reputation, even before a star had signed on.

Dustin Hoffman and Jack Nicholson both turned down the role. Richard Dreyfuss was considered. Tim Buckley was going to be offered the part but died of a drug overdose. Ashby interviewed David Carradine but turned him down, in part because he felt Carradine was too tall. However over time he reconsidered. &quot;He had the right rural look and the musicianship,&quot; said Ashby. &quot;And he had a ‘to hell with you’ attitude.&quot;

Ashby later said Carradine&#x27;s &quot;to hell with you&quot; attitude did cause him some problems during filming. &quot;Once, when we were doing a scene, some migrant workers marched by. David started marching with them. By the time we found him, he was two miles away; and he had held up shooting for three hours.”

The railroad scenes were filmed on the Sierra Railroad. Ashby wanted a &quot;big&quot; freight train for the movie, as opposed to the shorter trains commonly used in filmmaking. The railroad assembled a train of 34 freight cars. Scenes taking place on the Texas panhandle that did not include views of a locomotive were filmed near Stockton, California, using diesel locomotives. Scenes showing locomotives utilized three steam locomotives owned by the Sierra Railroad, and were filmed in and around Oakdale, California, and the roundhouse scenes were filmed at what is now Railtown 1897 in Jamestown, California.

==Reception==
As of January 2024, &quot;Bound for Glory&quot; holds a rating of 81% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 26 reviews. The consensus summarizes: &quot;&quot;Bound for Glory&quot; brings the Dust Bowl era to authentic life thanks to Haskell Wexler&#x27;s opulent cinematography and Woody Guthrie&#x27;s resonant music, capturing the American mood at the time as much as it does the folk singer&#x27;s life.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100 based on reviews from 4 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Film critic Roger Ebert praised the film, calling it &quot;one of the best-looking films ever made.&quot; However, Ebert claimed the beauty of the film was often achieved at the cost of the tone.

==Accolades==

<text>1,000 Hours is the debut EP by American rock band Green Day, released in April 1989 through Lookout Records. Through a shared interest in music, school friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt formed the band Sweet Children. With the addition of drummer John Kiffmeyer, they played at the local punk club 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California, where they started attracting a following. After playing a show with the Lookouts, one of their members, Larry Livermore, signed Sweet Children to his label Lookout Records. They co-produced their debut EP, &quot;1,000 Hours&quot;, with Andy Ernst at the Art of Ears Studio in San Francisco, California, in early 1989.

Critics praised the production quality of the &quot;1,000 Hours&quot; EP. Before its release, Sweet Children changed their name to Green Day, which Livermore said would make it difficult to shift copies of the EP. They played their last show as Sweet Children in April 1989, and played their first show as Green Day in May 1989, supporting Operation Ivy at Gilman. They subsequently played a show in July 1989 with Necromancy, before the members participated in other bands. &quot;1,000 Hours&quot; was later included in the &quot;1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours&quot; (1991) compilation alongside their other early releases.

==Background==
Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt became school friends in 1983. After a shared interest in music, and learning that Armstrong played guitar, Dirnt himself got a guitar. With Armstrong taking to writing his own material, the pair started a band. Sean Hughes played with them on bass; he joined for fun, while Armstrong was serious about creating music. Though they had other members, Raj Punjabi was the most frequent drummer in the line-up. They went through several names before sticking with Sweet Children. Armstrong and Dirnt worked security at punk club 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California, a position they used to analyse the various punk bands that performed there. Despite having jobs at the venue, they were unable to play there as Sweet Children as owner Tim Yohannan did not think the band sounded punk enough.

Around this time, Dirnt moved in with Armstrong&#x27;s family, allowing the pair to spend further time on the band. One day, they invited John Kiffmeyer, drummer of Gilman performers Isocracy, to jam with them. Kiffmeyer helped refine their sound, and give them a work ethic of recording music as cheaply and quickly as possible, in homage to the acts that influenced them, such the Buzzcocks and Ramones. Further inspiration was drawn from bands that performed at Gilman, where Armstrong mostly saw shows. Sweet Children played their first show at Gilman in November 1988, supporting Neurosis. They started gaining a following at Gilman in addition to playing house parties. During this time, Hughes left and Dirnt moved to the bass role. The latter latched on to the instrument quicker than he did guitar, practicing it at school during break periods and lunchtime.

==Signing and recording==
During one house party, Sweet Children were brought to the attention of Larry Livermore, who operated the local zine &quot;Lookout&quot;. Lookout Records spun off from the publication, though originally planned to only release material from Livermore&#x27;s band the Lookouts. Sometime later, he signed Sweet Children after they played a show with the Lookouts. Livermore was confident that before they ended the first track of their set that he wanted to make an album with them.

Livermore acknowledged that they were poppier than their contemporaries acts from Gilman: &quot;But I thought the songs and the performances were so good that they deserved to be captured on vinyl ...&quot; Sweet Children recorded their debut EP, &quot;1,000 Hours&quot;, at the Art of Ears Studio in San Francisco, California, in early 1989. Andy Ernst co-produced the proceedings with the band; he worked with fellow Lookout act Corrupted Morals prior to the session. Reportedly recorded in seven hours, the songs were done live with a few overdubs added afterwards.

==Composition and lyrics==

Gaar called the sound of &quot;1,000 Hours&quot; EP as up-tempo power pop, with AllMusic reviewer Ned Raggett adding that he could hear hints of heavy metal in the music. The former suggested that if a listener did not know anything about Sweet Children beforehand, they could infer influences from British Invasion bands or 1980s power pop in the style of the Romantics. The songs, as Gaar writes, are sung near &quot;breathlessly, as if Billie Joe wants to hurry through the numbers before losing his nerve in confessing his love ...&quot; The only thematic elements of the EP revolved around love and girls; Gaar proposed that thwarted love&#x27; would be a more accurate description,&quot; citing that &quot;1,000 Hours&quot;, &quot;Dry Ice&quot; and &quot;The One I Want&quot; has the narrator lamenting the distance between themselves and the person they desire.

Myers said the title track, &quot;1,000 Hours&quot; was a forceful, &quot;fuzzed-up pop song with infectious harmonies, lyrically unsophisticated perhaps, but then so is most pop music about girls&quot;. Armstrong was dismissive of the track: &quot;Not only was it not for a band to play or to play as a band, it&#x27;s just the sappiest song about a girl, to the point where it&#x27;s like a bad John Hughes movie!&quot; Myers felt that &quot;Dry Ice&quot; would not be amiss on the band&#x27;s later releases, such as on their third studio album &quot;Dookie&quot; (1994) or their sixth studio album &quot;Warning&quot; (2000). He found &quot;Only of You&quot; and &quot;The One I Want&quot; to be &quot;big surprise listen[s]&quot;, comparing them to popstar Tiffany. He explained that the latter&#x27;s 1988 track &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot; shared the similar lyrical topics of &quot;teen confusion, alienation and lost love, and the same sense of melody, as Billie Joe&#x27;s first release[d] song[s].&quot;

==Release and reception==
The record deal with Lookout Records made Sweet Children realise that they needed a new name, settling on Green Day. Livermore theorized that one reason for altering their name was that there was a band with the similar-sounding name of Sweet Baby, something that Gaar also noted. As Lookout were preparing to release the upcoming EP, he was furious: &quot;I was like, &#x27;Everybody knows you as Sweet Children. How am I supposed to sell a record by a band called Green Day? Sweet Children played their last show under this old moniker on April 1, 1989 at Gilman for a benefit show alongside Samiam and Stikky.

&quot;1,000 Hours&quot; EP released in April 1989 through Lookout Records on seven-inch vinyl. The artwork had the band&#x27;s name and the EP&#x27;s title in black ink against a green sleeve, which was swapped for pink when Livermore used up all the green paper when xeroxing the covers. The back of the EP sleeve, taken by Murray Bowles, had a picture of the band; additional roles were listed for each member, such as Armstrong with &quot;hat&quot;, Dirnt with &quot;hair&quot; and Kiffmeyer with &quot;bus&quot;. Gaar suggested that the extra credits alluded to back cover, which had Armstrong wearing a baseball cap on backwards and Dirnt hanging off a railing upside as his hair reaches the floor below. The second pressing of the EP included a lyric sheet, offering credits for the songs.

Dirnt said the members of Green Day went into Lookout&#x27;s office when the EP arrived from the pressing planet to help staff fold the sleeve for each record. Livermore commented that due to the poppy nature of the release that it would be difficult to sell to Lookout Records-inclined record buyers. It subsequent took around six months for the EP to start attracting attention from the public. According to Myers, the &quot;1,000 Hours&quot; EP became a consistent-selling release for Lookout Records. He mentioned that while it did not have a unique musical direction amongst their peers, the EP helped to place Green Day as well as Berkeley &quot;on the map.&quot; Green Day performed for the first time since the name change supporting Operation Ivy on May 28, 1989, at Gilman. They then supported Necromancy for a show in Davis, California, 50 miles away from where they were located. Around this time, Armstrong and Dirnt were preoccupied with appearing in other bands: Blazt and Corrupted Morals for the former, and Crummy Musicians for the latter.
Critics latched on to the production of EP. Raggett focused on &quot;how polished, even downright professional, everything sounds ... clearly recorded and instantly engaging.&quot; Akin to their other early work, Raggett found the four tracks to be &quot;engaging rather than flat-out fantastic.&quot; Spitz was also impressed with &quot;how ready the band sounds&quot;; Myers, similarly, commented that what he heard to be alarming was &quot;not the relatively cheap-sounding production ... but the ability of three school kids who have been lucky enough – or talented, or a bit of both – to find their own unique voice early on.&quot;

The &quot;1,000 Hours&quot; EP was included in its entirety alongside &quot;39/Smooth&quot; and the &quot;Slappy&quot; (1990) EP as part of the &quot;1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours&quot; (1991) compilation. In late 2005, citing a royalty dispute, the band took control of their Lookout Records-era releases, including &quot;1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours&quot;, second studio album &quot;Kerplunk&quot;, and the &quot;1,000 Hours&quot; and &quot;Slappy&quot; (1990) EPs.

<text>Network is a 1976 American satirical black comedy drama film directed by Sidney Lumet and written by Paddy Chayefsky. It is about a fictional television network and its struggle with poor ratings. The film stars Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Peter Finch (in his final film role), Robert Duvall, Wesley Addy, Ned Beatty, and Beatrice Straight.

Produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and released by United Artists on November 27, 1976, &quot;Network&quot; was a commercial success, earning $23.7 million on a $3.8 million production budget. Widely considered to be one of the greatest films ever made, &quot;Network&quot; received widespread critical acclaim, with particular praise for its screenplay and performances. At the 49th Academy Awards, it received ten nominations, including Best Picture, and won four: Best Actor for Finch (posthumously), Best Actress for Dunaway, Best Supporting Actress for Straight, and Best Original Screenplay for Chayefsky.

In 2000, &quot;Network&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2002, it was inducted into the Producers Guild of America Hall of Fame as a film that has &quot;set an enduring standard for American entertainment&quot;. In 2005 the Writers Guild of America voted Chayefsky&#x27;s screenplay one of the 10 greatest in history. In 2007, the film was 64th among the 100 greatest American films as chosen by the American Film Institute.

== Plot ==
In September 1975, Howard Beale, the longtime anchor for the &quot;UBS Evening News&quot;, the flagship evening news program of the Union Broadcasting System (UBS), learns from friend and news division president Max Schumacher that he has just two more weeks on the air because of declining ratings. The following night, Beale announces to his audience that he will commit suicide on next Tuesday&#x27;s newscast. UBS tries to immediately fire Beale, but Schumacher intervenes so that he can have a dignified farewell. Beale promises to apologize for his outburst, but once on the air, he launches into a rant about life being &quot;bullshit&quot;. Beale&#x27;s outburst causes ratings to spike, and much to Schumacher&#x27;s dismay, UBS executives decide to exploit the situation. When Beale&#x27;s ratings soon top out, programming chief Diana Christensen reaches out to Schumacher with an offer to help &quot;develop&quot; Beale&#x27;s show. He declines the professional proposal but accepts her more personal pitch; the two begin an affair.

When Schumacher decides to end Beale&#x27;s &quot;angry man&quot; format, Christensen persuades her boss, Frank Hackett, to slot the evening news show under the entertainment division so she can develop it. Hackett bullies UBS executives to consent and fire Schumacher. In one impassioned diatribe, Beale galvanizes the nation, persuading viewers to shout, &quot;I&#x27;m as mad as hell, and I&#x27;m not going to take this anymore!&quot; from their windows. He is soon hosting a new program called &quot;The Howard Beale Show&quot;, top-billed as &quot;the mad prophet of the airwaves&quot;. The show becomes the most highly rated program on television, and Beale finds new celebrity preaching his angry populist message in front of a live studio audience that, on cue, chants his signature catchphrase: &quot;We&#x27;re as mad as hell, and we&#x27;re not going to take this anymore!&quot; Schumacher and Christensen&#x27;s romance withers as the show flourishes, but in the flush of high ratings, the two ultimately find their way back together; Schumacher separates from his wife of over 25 years for Christensen.

Seeking another hit, Christensen cuts a deal with a terrorist group called the Ecumenical Liberation Army (ELA) for a new docudrama series, &quot;The Mao Tse-Tung Hour&quot;, for which the ELA will provide exclusive footage of their activities. Meanwhile, Beale discovers that Communications Corporation of America (CCA), the parent company of UBS, will be bought out by a larger Saudi conglomerate. He urges his audience to pressure the White House to quash the deal. This panics UBS because the network&#x27;s debt load has made the merger essential for its survival. CCA chairman Arthur Jensen arranges a meeting with Beale, describing the interrelatedness of the participants in the international economy and the illusory nature of nationality distinctions. Jensen scolds Beale and persuades him to abandon his message and preach a new gospel that serves Jensen&#x27;s interests.

Christensen&#x27;s fanatical devotion to her job and emotional emptiness ultimately drive Schumacher away, warning her that she will self-destruct if she continues on her current path. Audiences find Beale&#x27;s new sermons on the dehumanization of society depressing and ratings start to slip, yet Jensen refuses to fire him. To boost the network&#x27;s ratings, Christensen, Hackett and the other executives decide to hire the ELA to assassinate Beale on the air. The assassination succeeds, putting an end to &quot;The Howard Beale Show&quot; and kicking off the second season of &quot;The Mao Tse-Tung Hour&quot;. A voice-over proclaims, &quot;This was the story of Howard Beale: the first known instance of a man who was killed because he had lousy ratings.&quot;

== Production ==
=== Development and writing ===
&quot;Network&quot; came only two years after the first on-screen suicide in television history, of television news reporter Christine Chubbuck in Sarasota, Florida. The anchorwoman was suffering from depression and loneliness, was often emotionally distant from her co-workers, and shot herself on camera as stunned viewers watched on July 15, 1974. Chayefsky used the idea of a live death as his film&#x27;s terminating focal point, to say later in an interview, &quot;Television will do anything for a rating... anything!&quot;  However, Dave Itzkoff&#x27;s book (&quot;Mad as Hell: The Making of Network and the Fateful Vision of the Angriest Man in Movies&quot;) allows that whether Chayefsky was inspired by the Chubbuck case remains unclear, that Chayefsky&#x27;s screenplay notes on the week of the live death have nothing about the incident in them, and grants it is an eerie parallel. It was to be months later that actual direct reference was made, Chayefsky writing for Beale to bray that he &quot;will blow my brains out right on the air ... like that girl in Florida&quot;, which was later removed. Sidney Lumet made the categorical statement that the character of Howard Beale was never based on any real-life person.

Before beginning his screenplay, Chayefsky visited network TV offices. He was surprised to learn that television executives did not watch much television. &quot;The programs they put on &#x27;had to&#x27; be bad, had to be something they wouldn&#x27;t watch,&quot; he remarked. &quot;Imagine having to work like that all your life.&quot; According to Dave Itzkoff, what Chayefsky saw while writing the screenplay during the midst of Watergate and the Vietnam War was the entirety of America&#x27;s anger being broadcast in everything from sitcoms to news reports. He concluded that Americans &quot;don&#x27;t want jolly, happy family type shows like Eye Witness News&quot; ... &quot;the American people are angry and want angry shows.&quot; When he began writing his script he had intended on a comedy, but instead directed his frustration at the content being broadcast on television—which he described as &quot;an indestructible and terrifying giant that is stronger than the government&quot;—into the screenplay. It became a &quot;dark satire about an unstable news anchor and a broadcasting company and a viewing public all too happy to follow him over the brink of sanity.&quot; The character of network executive Diana Christiansen was based on NBC daytime television programming executive Lin Bolen, which Bolen disputed.

Chayefsky and producer Howard Gottfried had just come off a lawsuit against United Artists, challenging the studio&#x27;s right to lease their previous film, &quot;The Hospital&quot;, to ABC in a package with a less successful film. Despite this recent legal action, Chayefsky and Gottfried signed a deal with UA to finance &quot;Network&quot;, until UA found the subject matter too controversial and backed out. Undeterred, Chayefsky and Gottfried shopped the script around to other studios, and eventually found an interested party in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Soon afterward, United Artists reversed itself and looked to co-finance the film with MGM, since the latter had an ongoing distribution arrangement with UA in North America. Since MGM agreed to let UA back on board, the former (through United Artists as per the arrangement) controlled North American/Caribbean rights, with UA opting for overseas distribution.

=== Casting ===
In his notes, Chayefsky jotted down his ideas about casting. For Howard Beale, who would eventually be played by Peter Finch, he envisioned Henry Fonda, Cary Grant, James Stewart and Paul Newman. He went so far as to write Newman, telling him that &quot;You and a very small handful of other actors are the only ones I can think of with the range for this part.&quot; Lumet wanted Fonda, with whom he had worked several times, but Fonda declined the role, finding it too &quot;hysterical&quot; for his taste. Stewart also found the script unsuitable, objecting to the strong language. Early consideration was given to real-life newscasters Walter Cronkite and John Chancellor, but neither was open to the idea (both appear during the opening scene through stock footage). Although not mentioned in Chayefsky&#x27;s notes, George C. Scott, Glenn Ford and William Holden reportedly also turned down the opportunity to play Beale, with Holden instead playing Max Schumacher: For that role, Chayefsky had initially listed Walter Matthau and Gene Hackman. Ford was under consideration for this part as well, and he was said to be one of two final contenders. Holden finally got the edge because of his recent box-office success with &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;.

Producers were wary that Finch, an Australian, would not be able to sound authentically American; they demanded an audition before his casting could be considered. A well-known actor, Finch reportedly responded, &quot;Bugger pride. Put the script in the mail.&quot; Immediately excited by the role, he agreed to pay his own fare to New York for a screen test. He prepared for the audition by listening to broadcasts by American newscasters and reading the international editions of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; into a tape recorder, then listening to playbacks with a critical ear. Gottfried recalled that Finch &quot;was nervous as hell at that first meeting over lunch and just like a kid auditioning. Once we&#x27;d heard him, Sidney Lumet, Paddy, and I were ecstatic because we knew it was a hell of a part to cast.&quot; Finch further convinced Lumet by playing him the tapes of his newspaper readings.

Faye Dunaway wanted Robert Mitchum to play Max Schumacher, but Lumet refused, believing that Mitchum was not sufficiently urbane. For the role of Diana Christensen, Chayefsky thought of Candice Bergen, Ellen Burstyn, and Natalie Wood, while the studio suggested Jane Fonda, with alternate candidates Kay Lenz, Diane Keaton, Marsha Mason and Jill Clayburgh. Lumet wanted to cast Vanessa Redgrave in the film, but Chayefsky did not want her. Lumet argued that he thought she was the greatest English-speaking actress in the world, while Chayefsky, a proud Jew and supporter of Israel, objected on the basis of her support of the PLO. Lumet, also a Jew, said &quot;Paddy, that&#x27;s blacklisting!&quot;, to which Chayefsky replied, &quot;Not when a Jew does it to a Gentile.&quot;

Dunaway was cast as Diana in September 1975. Lumet told her that he would edit any attempts on her part to make her character sympathetic and insisted on presenting her without any vulnerability. Lumet cast Robert Duvall as Frank Hackett. Duvall saw Hackett as a &quot;vicious president Ford&quot;. On Duvall, Lumet said: &quot;What&#x27;s fascinating about Duvall is how funny he is.&quot; Ned Beatty was cast as Arthur Jensen on the recommendation of director Robert Altman after the original actor failed to live up to Lumet&#x27;s standards. Beatty had one night to prepare a four-page speech, and was finished after one day&#x27;s shooting. Beatrice Straight played Louise Schumacher, Max&#x27;s wife, on whom he cheats with Diana. Straight had won a Tony Award in 1953 for playing an anguished wife who is similarly cheated on in Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Crucible&quot;.

=== Filming ===
After two weeks of rehearsals, filming started in Toronto in January 1976 with many scenes filmed at the CFTO studios at 9 Channel Nine Court in Scarborough.

Lumet recalled that Chayefsky was usually on set during filming, and sometimes offered advice about how certain scenes should be played. Lumet allowed that his old friend had the better comic instincts of the two. Finch, who had suffered from heart problems for many years, became physically and psychologically exhausted by the demands of playing Beale.

There was some concern that the combination of Holden and Dunaway might create conflict on the set, since the two had sparred during an earlier co-starring stint in &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;. According to biographer Bob Thomas, Holden had been incensed by Dunaway&#x27;s behavior during the filming of the disaster epic, especially her habit of leaving him fuming on the set while she attended to her hair, makeup and telephone calls. One day, after a two-hour wait, Holden reportedly grabbed Dunaway by the shoulders, pushed her against a soundstage wall and snapped, &quot;You do that to me once more, and I&#x27;ll push you through that wall!&quot;

Lumet and cinematographer Owen Roizman worked out a complicated lighting scheme that in Lumet&#x27;s words would &quot;corrupt the camera&quot;. Lumet recalled: &quot;We started with an almost naturalistic look. For the first scene between Peter Finch and Bill Holden, on Sixth Avenue at night, we added only enough light to get an exposure. As the movie progressed, camera setups became more rigid, more formal. The lighting became more and more artificial. The next-to-final scene—where Faye Dunaway, Robert Duvall, and the three network gray suits decide to kill Peter Finch—is lit like a commercial. The camera setups are static and framed like still pictures. The camera had also become a victim of television.&quot;

== Release and reception ==
&quot;Network&quot; premiered in New York City on November 27, 1976, and went into wide release shortly afterward. The film opened to widespread critical acclaim, and became one of the big hits of 1976–77, earning $23.7 million at the box office.

===Critical reception===
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;Network&quot; &quot;outrageous ... brilliantly, cruelly funny, a topical American comedy that confirms Paddy Chayefsky&#x27;s position as a major new American satirist&quot; and a film whose &quot;wickedly distorted views of the way television looks, sounds, and, indeed, is, are the satirist&#x27;s cardiogram of the hidden heart, not just of television but also of the society that supports it and is, in turn, supported.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave &quot;Network&quot; four stars out of four, calling it &quot;a very funny movie that takes an easy target and giddily beats it to death.&quot; In a review written after &quot;Network&quot; received its Academy Awards, Roger Ebert called it a &quot;supremely well-acted, intelligent film that tries for too much, that attacks not only television but also most of the other ills of the 1970s,&quot; though &quot;what it does accomplish is done so well, is seen so sharply, is presented so unforgivingly, that &quot;Network&quot; will outlive a lot of tidier movies.&quot;

Not all reviews were positive: Pauline Kael in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s abundance of long, preachy speeches; Chayefsky&#x27;s self-righteous contempt for not only television itself but also television viewers; and the fact that almost everyone in the movie, particularly Robert Duvall, has a shouting rant: &quot;The cast of this messianic farce takes turns yelling at us soulless masses.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared that &quot;the movie is too sternly, monotonously preachy for either persuasion or casual amusement.&quot; Michael Billington wrote, &quot;Too much of this film has the hectoring stridency of tabloid headlines&quot;, while Chris Petit in &quot;Time Out&quot; described it as &quot;slick, &#x27;adult&#x27;, self-congratulatory, and almost entirely hollow&quot;, adding that &quot;most of the interest comes in watching such a lavishly mounted vehicle leaving the rails so spectacularly.&quot;

Jack Shaheen, an American writer and lecturer who specialized in addressing racial and ethnic stereotypes, was critical of the film in his book, &quot;Reel Bad Arabs&quot;. He put it on his worst list, noting that Arabs were portrayed as &quot;medieval fanatics,&quot; and criticized Chayefsky&#x27;s &quot;prejudicial Arab colloquies.&quot; He also asked whether Chayefsky would label Israelis as &quot;medieval fanatics&quot; and wondered why the producer, Howard Gottfried, and director, Sidney Lumet, sanctioned Chayefsky&#x27;s &quot;anti-Arab diatribe,&quot; as he described it, in the film. He additionally described the film&#x27;s focus on Arabs not only to be &quot;racist,&quot; but also nonfactual, and noted that Chayefsky condemned Vanessa Redgrave after she described demonstrators, protesting her pro-Palestinian views, as &quot;a small bunch of Zionist hoodlums&quot; at the 1978 Academy Awards ceremony.

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 76 reviews, with an average rating of 8.50/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states, &quot;Driven by populist fury and elevated by strong direction, powerful acting, and an intelligent script, &quot;Network&quot;″s searing satire of ratings-driven news remains sadly relevant more than four decades later.&quot; On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 83 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

=== Legacy ===
In 2000, Roger Ebert added the film to his Great Movies list and said it was &quot;like prophecy. When Chayefsky created Howard Beale, could he have imagined Jerry Springer, Howard Stern, and the World Wrestling Federation?&quot;; he credits Lumet and Chayefsky for knowing &quot;just when to pull out all the stops.&quot; Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin wrote in 2011 that &quot;no predictor of the future—not even Orwell—has ever been as right as Chayefsky was when he wrote &quot;Network&quot;.&quot; The film ranks at number 100 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Films of All Time.

=== Accolades ===
At the Academy Awards, &quot;Network&quot; won three of the four acting awards. As of 2024, it is the second of only three films which have accomplished this feat, preceded by &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; in 1951 and followed by &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot; in 2022.

Peter Finch died before the 1977 ceremony and was the only performer to win a posthumous acting Academy Award until Heath Ledger won Best Supporting Actor in 2008. The statuette itself was collected by Finch&#x27;s widow, Eletha Finch, after Paddy Chayefsky invited her onstage.

Beatrice Straight&#x27;s performance as Louise Schumacher occupied only five minutes and two seconds of screen time, making it the shortest performance to win an Oscar (breaking Gloria Grahame&#x27;s nine minute and 32 second screen time record for &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; in 1952). Additionally, Ned Beatty&#x27;s performance of Arthur Jensen occupied only six minutes of screen time, also making it the shortest performance by an actor to be nominated for an Oscar .

<text>The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (; 1780–1784) was a conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic. The war, contemporary with the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), broke out over British and Dutch disagreements on the legality and conduct of Dutch trade with Britain&#x27;s enemies in that war.

Although the Dutch Republic did not enter into a formal alliance with the rebelling American colonies and their allies, American ambassador (and future president) John Adams managed to establish diplomatic relations with the Dutch Republic, making it the second European country to diplomatically recognise the Continental Congress in April 1782. In October 1782, a treaty of amity and commerce was concluded as well.

Most of the war consisted of a series of British operations against Dutch colonial economic interests, although British and Dutch naval forces also met once off the Dutch coast. The war ended disastrously for the Dutch and exposed the weakness of the political and economic foundations of the republic.

The war settled the decline of the Dutch Empire and further cemented Great Britain as the leading commercial power.

==Background==
Although Great Britain and the Dutch Republic had been allies since the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the Dutch had become very much the junior partner in the alliance and had slowly lost their former dominance of world trade to the British. During the Second Stadtholderless Period, the Dutch Republic had more or less abdicated its pretences as a major power and this became painfully evident to the rest of Europe during the War of the Austrian Succession. Near the end of that war in 1747, an Orangist revolution restored the stadtholderate with vastly increased powers for the stadtholder and made the stadtholderate hereditary. This did not lead to a resurgence of the republic as a major power because of what many in the republic saw as the mismanagement of the stadtholderian regency during the minority of stadtholder William V, and subsequently during his own reign. Instead, the republic remained stubbornly neutral during the Seven Years&#x27; War, which enabled it to greatly neglect both its army and navy. The stadtholderian regime was pro-British, with the stadtholder being a grandson of King George II of Great Britain, but his opponents for this reason favoured France, and those opponents were strong enough in the States General of the Netherlands (the governing body of the Republic whose &quot;first servant&quot; the stadtholder was) to keep Dutch foreign policy neutral.

Initially, the British considered the Dutch allies in their attempt to stamp out the rebellion in their North American Thirteen Colonies. They attempted to &quot;borrow&quot; the mercenary Scots Brigade of the Dutch States Army for use in the Americas, in a similar manner to the Hessian and Brunswicker contingents they hired and deployed. This was strongly opposed by the Dutch sympathizers of the American Revolution, led by Baron Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol, who managed to convince the States General to refuse the British request.

More importantly, Dutch merchants, especially those from Amsterdam, became involved in the supply of arms and munitions to the American rebels soon after the outbreak of American Revolutionary War. This trade was mainly conducted via the Caribbean entrepôt of St. Eustatius, an island colony of the Dutch West India Company. There, American colonial wares, such as tobacco and indigo, were imported (in contravention of the British Navigation Acts) and re-exported to Europe. For their return cargo, the Americans purchased arms, munitions, and naval stores brought to the island by Dutch and French merchants. In 1776 the governor of the island, Johannes de Graeff, was the first to salute the flag of the United States, leading to growing British suspicions of the Dutch. In 1778, the Dutch refused take Britain&#x27;s side in the war against France. The British invoked a number of old treaties (1678, 1689, 1716) to have the republic support them militarily, but as in the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Dutch government refused.

After the French declared war on Britain, Amsterdam merchants also became heavily involved in the trade in naval stores with France. The French needed those supplies for their naval construction, but were prevented from obtaining those themselves, due to the blockade by the Royal Navy (France being the weaker naval power in that conflict). The Dutch were privileged by a concession obtained after their victory in the Second Anglo-Dutch War, known as the principle of &quot;free ship, free goods&quot;, which was enshrined in the Anglo-Dutch Commercial Treaty of 1668, reconfirmed in the Treaty of Westminster (1674). This early formulation of the principle of Freedom of Navigation exempted all but narrowly defined &quot;contraband&quot; goods carried in Dutch ships from confiscation by the British prize courts, in wars in which the Dutch remained neutral. According to the treaty naval stores, including ship&#x27;s timbers, masts, spars, canvas, tar, rope, and pitch, were not contraband and the Dutch, therefore, were free to continue their trade with France in these goods. Because of the still-important role of the Dutch in the European carrying trade, this opened up a large loophole in the British embargo. The British then unilaterally declared naval stores to be contraband and enforced their embargo by arresting Dutch and other neutral ships on the high seas.

This led to strong protests by the affected Dutch merchants, who demanded institution of convoys escorted by the Dutch States Navy, to protect them against the Royal Navy and British privateers. According to customary international law, such convoys were (and still are) exempt from the right of Visit and Search by belligerents. Initially, the stadtholder managed to prevent this, but strong diplomatic pressure by France, that selectively applied economic sanctions to Dutch cities supporting the stadtholder in this policy, forced his hand in November 1779. The States General now ordered him to provide the escorts and the first convoy, under command of Rear Admiral Lodewijk van Bylandt, sailed in December. This led to the humiliating Affair of Fielding and Bylandt on 31 December, which enraged Dutch public opinion and further undermined the position of the stadtholder. The incident motivated the Dutch to seek admission to the First League of Armed Neutrality, which espoused the principle of &quot;free ship, free goods&quot;, especially after Britain formally abrogated the Commercial Treaty of 1668. The Dutch hoped to gain the armed support of the other members of the league to maintain their neutral status.

==War==
===Declaration of war===
The British government saw the danger of this move (it might embroil Great Britain in war with Russia and the Nordic powers Sweden and Denmark–Norway also), so declared war on the republic shortly after it announced its intentions in December 1780.
To forestall Russia from coming to the aid of the Dutch (something Empress Catherine II of Russia was not keen on, either), the British government cited a number of grievances that were ostensibly unrelated to the Dutch accession to the league. One of these was the shelter the Dutch had (reluctantly) given to the American privateer John Paul Jones in 1779. More importantly, much was made of a draft treaty of commerce, secretly negotiated between the Amsterdam banker Jean de Neufville and the American agent in Aix-la-Chapelle, William Lee, with the connivance of the Amsterdam pensionary Van Berckel, and found among the effects of Henry Laurens, an American diplomat who had been apprehended by the British cruiser HMS &quot;Vestal&quot; in September 1780, on the high seas. He had been sent by the Continental Congress to establish diplomatic relations with the Dutch Republic. The draft treaty was cited as proof by the British of the non-neutral conduct of the Dutch.

===Progress of the war===
Dutch naval power had been in decline since 1712. The fleet had been long neglected, and the Dutch navy, having only 20 ships of the line at the start of the conflict, was no match for the British Royal Navy. Although the States General had decided on a substantial expansion of the fleet in 1779, just before the fateful decision to offer limited convoys, and had even voted the funds for such a naval-construction program, it progressed but slowly. Another reason for the slow expansion of the Dutch fleet was a lack of suitable recruits—the Dutch navy paid lower wages than the merchant marine and did not use impressment like the Royal Navy. The number of available ships was diminished even more at the start of the war when several ships were captured by the British in the West Indies because they were unaware the war had started. A convoy under Rear Admiral Willem Krul was lost this way near St. Eustatius in February 1781, and the admiral was killed in the short action; in a different action, Captain Bylandt (a nephew of the admiral of the same name) surrendered his ship.

The pronounced inferiority of the Dutch fleet, and its state of &quot;unreadiness&quot; was a frequently reiterated excuse for the Dutch naval commanders, especially Vice Admiral Andries Hartsinck, who commanded the Texel squadron, to keep the fleet at anchor, thereby ceding dominance of the North Sea to the blockading British fleet. Within a few weeks of the beginning of the war, more than 200 Dutch merchantmen, with cargo to the amount of 15 million guilders, had been captured by the British and 300 more were locked up in foreign ports.

Another reason for the lack of activity of the Dutch navy was the fact that diplomatic activity never ceased and gave the Dutch government the illusion that the war would be of only short duration. Empress Catharine, though she refused to come to the aid of the Dutch, was very active in offering her services to mediate the dispute. Both the British and the Dutch, with varying amounts of sincerity, cooperated in these diplomatic manoeuvres, which came to nothing, but helped to keep military activities at a low level while they lasted.

The British government also made overtures to the Dutch to come to a speedy conclusion of hostilities, especially after the cabinet of Lord North had been replaced by that of Rockingham and Fox in March 1782. Fox immediately proposed a separate peace on favourable conditions to the Dutch government. Unfortunately for the Dutch, they had just bound themselves closer to France by agreeing to act &quot;in concert&quot; with France in naval actions, so a separate peace was no longer an option. A real military alliance with France was, however, still blocked by the stadtholder, despite the fact that many in the republic favoured it.

The war, as far as it went, was fought in three main theatres. Britain blockaded Dutch ports in Europe, and embarked on expeditions to seize Dutch colonial properties throughout the world. These were almost entirely successful; only an attempt to capture the Dutch Elmina Castle on the Africa&#x27;s Gold Coast (modern Ghana) failed. While many Dutch territories in the West Indies were taken by the British, some, like Curaçao, were not attacked due to their defensive strength.

====West Indies====

As far as the Dutch were concerned, the war in the West Indies was over almost before it had begun. Admiral Rodney, the commander of the Leeward Islands station of the Royal Navy, attacked the Dutch colonies in that part of the Caribbean: St. Eustatius, Saba, and Saint Martin, as soon as he had received word of the declaration of war, in the process surprising a number of Dutch naval and merchant ships, which were still unaware of the start of hostilities. St. Eustatius (captured on 3 February 1781), that had played such a large role in the supply of the American rebels with arms, was completely devastated by him. He proved himself especially vengeful against the Jewish merchants on the island. All goods on the island were confiscated and all merchants, Dutch, American, French, even British, deported. Part of the loot was auctioned off on the spot, but an appreciable amount was put on a convoy destined for Britain. However, much of the convoy was captured in the English Channel by a French squadron under Admiral Picquet de la Motte. The French did not return the goods to the Dutch, however.

Though an attempt was made to likewise capture the Dutch Leeward Antilles, these remained in Dutch hands, as did Suriname, though neighbouring Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo were rapidly taken by the British early in 1781. These were retaken by the French captain Armand de Kersaint in 1782, and restored to the Dutch after the war.

====European waters====
Admiral Hartsinck at first proved himself highly reluctant to risk his fleet. However, political pressure to venture outside the safety of the Texel roadstead mounted and several cautious attempts were made to capture British convoys, or escort Dutch convoys. In one of those forays, an unusually strong squadron, under Admiral Johan Zoutman and his second-in-command, Rear Admiral Jan Hendrik van Kinsbergen, encountered in August 1781 a British squadron of about equal strength under Admiral Hyde Parker in the Battle of Dogger Bank, which ended in a tactical draw.

Another promising venture seemed to be what has become known as the Brest Affair. In September 1782, after the Dutch politicians had hesitantly agreed to coordinate their actions with the French, acting &quot;in concert&quot;, an opportunity seemed to exist to combine a Dutch squadron of 10 ships of the line with the French squadron at Brest, as the British fleet in the channel had suddenly sailed south. However, Hartsinck, as usual, made objections, based on intelligence that British ships lay in ambush. When this proved false, the stadtholder ordered him to send the squadron, under command of Vice Admiral Count Lodewijk van Bylandt to Brest. However, as had happened countless times before, Bylandt, after having inspected the ships, declared them &quot;unready&quot; to put out to sea. In this refusal, he was supported by the other flag officers. The incident caused a political storm that threatened to engulf the stadtholder himself, as he was responsible as commander-in-chief for both the state of readiness of the fleet and its strategic decisions (though the officers were tactically and operationally responsible, and could not decline responsibility for the alleged state of &quot;unreadiness&quot; themselves). The opponents of the stadtholder demanded an investigation that was, however, very long drawn out, and quietly terminated after the stadtholder was restored in his full powers after 1787, long after the end of the war.

Though, except for the Dogger-Bank skirmish, no major battles were fought in European waters, and the British blockade encountered little opposition from the Dutch fleet, the blockade itself exacted its toll on the British seamen, who were at sea for long times at a stretch (which even exposed them to the danger of scurvy) and the ships that suffered from severe wear and tear. Also, because an appreciable number of ships had to be detached to maintain naval superiority in the North Sea, the already overstretched Royal Navy was even more strained after 1781. Ships that were needed to blockade the Dutch coast could not be used against the French, Americans, and Spaniards in other theatres of war. This may have contributed to a number of the naval defeats the British suffered after 1781.

====Asian waters====
The Dutch East India Company (VOC) had been responsible for defending its own colonies east of the Cape Colony, but for the first time, had to request assistance from the Dutch navy. However, ships were lacking at first and what naval forces were available were unable to prevent Britain from taking full control of Dutch India. In early 1782 British Admiral Sir Edward Hughes captured Trincomalee on the eastern coast of Dutch Ceylon, considered to be the finest harbour in the Bay of Bengal.

In March 1781, British Admiral George Johnstone was sent to capture the Cape Colony. France, which had already planned to send a fleet to India, received intelligence of this, and directed its commander, the Bailli de Suffren, to try to reach the Cape before Johnstone. After Johnstone and Suffren met in a happenstance battle in the Cape Verde Islands, Suffren was able to arrive before Johnstone, and the strength of French troops he left dissuaded Johnstone from attacking the colony. After capturing a number of VOC ships in the nearby Saldanha Bay, he returned to North Atlantic waters.

Suffren had continued on to Isle de France (now Mauritius) and then India. There, he arrived and fought a number of actions against Hughes. Suffren attempted to take the Dutch port of Negapatam (taken by the British in 1781), but was frustrated by Hughes. In August, the French recaptured Trincomalee, and Suffren fought Hughes to a standstill in a naval battle several days later. The two fleets withdrew and the British repaired in Bombay while the French refitted in the Dutch colony of Sumatra. Hughes and Suffren met again in 1783, but news of preliminary peace between France and Britain ended hostilities in India.

In August 1781, word of the war reached Sumatra, where both the Dutch and British companies had trading outposts. The directors of the British company at Fort Marlborough received instructions from Bombay to destroy all of the Dutch outposts on the west coast of Sumatra. Quite fortuitously, a fleet of five East Indiamen arrived not long after, and the directors seized the opportunity for action. Henry Botham, one of the directors, commandeered the fleet, and with 100 company soldiers sailed for Padang. On 18 August, Jacob van Heemskerk, the VOC chief resident at Padang, surrendered all of the west coast outposts without a fight, unaware that Botham&#x27;s force was relatively weak. The capture netted the British 500,000 florins in goods and money. The fortress at Padang was destroyed before the town was returned to VOC control in 1784.

===Ceasefire and Treaty of Paris===

The republic did not form a formal military alliance with France and her allies before the end of the war. A treaty of amity and commerce was, however, concluded with the Americans in October 1782, after John Adams, who succeeded Henry Laurens, had managed to obtain diplomatic recognition of the American republic from the States General in April 1782. The republic was the second European power (after France, but before Spain) to recognise the United States. Adams also succeeded in raising a substantial loan for the Americans on the still-significant Dutch capital market.

The republic involved itself in the peace congress that the French foreign minister, Vergennes, organised, negotiating separately with the British commissioners. The Dutch demands were not supported by the French, and this put them into an untenable position when the French and their allies went ahead with the signing of the general peace. The Dutch, therefore, were forced to sign a preliminary peace just before that general treaty was signed. The republic joined the armistice between Britain and France in January 1783. The signing of the Treaty of Paris (1783–1784) made Negapatnam, in India, a British colony. Ceylon was restored to Dutch control. The British gained the right of free trade with part of the Dutch East Indies, which had been a major war aim for British merchants. The French also returned the other Dutch colonies they had recaptured from the British, including the ones in the West Indies (like St. Eustatius that had been taken by Admiral Rodney in February 1781, but was retaken by the French Admiral De Grasse on 27 November 1781).

==Aftermath==
The war proved a disaster for the Netherlands, particularly economically. It also proved to be confirmation of the weakening of Dutch power in the 18th century. In the immediate aftermath of the war, the bad result was blamed on the stadholder&#x27;s mismanagement (if not worse) by his opponents, who coalesced into the Patriot party. These managed for a while to roll back a number of the reforms of the revolution of 1747, strongly diminishing his powers. However, this Patriot revolt was suppressed in 1787 by Prussian and British intervention. The Patriots were driven abroad, but returned in 1795 with the help of the French revolutionary armies and established a Batavian Republic in place of the old Dutch Republic. The Low Countries remained central to British strategic thinking, and they sent expeditionary forces to the Netherlands in 1793, 1799, and 1809.
The war caused severe damage to the VOC, which already in a severe crisis, was to go bankrupt just a few years later.

<doc id="101939" wikidata="Q214708" url="?curid=101939" title="Insomniac (Green Day album)">
<text>Insomniac is the fourth studio album by the American rock band Green Day, released on October 10, 1995, by Reprise Records. It was recorded at Hyde Street in San Francisco, and the band prioritized high-energy takes during the recording sessions. Released as the follow-up to the band&#x27;s multi-platinum breakthrough &quot;Dookie&quot;, &quot;Insomniac&quot; featured a heavier, hardcore punk sound, with bleaker lyrics than its predecessor. Lyrically, the album discusses themes such as alienation, anxiety, boredom, and drug use. &quot;Insomniac&quot; also served as a reaction to many early fans who had turned their backs on the band after it achieved mainstream success with &quot;Dookie&quot;.

The album received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the singer Billie Joe Armstrong&#x27;s songwriting and sarcastic sense of humor. Three songs were released as singles, &quot;Geek Stink Breath&quot;, &quot;Stuck with Me&quot;, and &quot;Brain Stew / Jaded&quot;. Though it peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and was certified 2× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1996, &quot;Insomniac&quot; did not have the sales endurance of its predecessor &quot;Dookie&quot;, largely due to its slightly darker lyrical tone and its heavier and more abrasive sound. &quot;Insomniac&quot; has sold over 2.1 million copies in the United States as of 2012. The album was reissued on vinyl on May 12, 2009. In 2021, a deluxe version of the album was released for its 25th anniversary, including previously unreleased live tracks.

==Background==

Green Day&#x27;s previous album &quot;Dookie&quot; (1994), their first for a major label, was approaching the ten-million sales mark by the time of recording &quot;Insomniac&quot;, and the band&#x27;s success saw them rejected by the punk circles in which the group got their start. The group also began performing at large venues such as coliseums and hockey arenas. The singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong was stung by criticisms of being a &quot;sell out&quot;, telling an interviewer: &quot;I think I was just lost. I couldn&#x27;t find the strength to convince myself that what I was doing was a good thing. I was in a band that was huge because it was supposed to be huge, because our songs were that good. But I couldn&#x27;t even feel that I was doing the right thing, because it felt like I was making so many people angry.&quot;

The band&#x27;s state of discombobulation inspired them to prove themselves with &quot;Insomniac&quot;. The bassist Mike Dirnt later said: &quot;I felt at the time that there was a real urgency to what we were doing. There was a real urgency to stake our claim and say, &#x27;No, we belong here.&#x27; It was really important to us to make sure people knew that we weren’t just a flash in the pan.&quot; During this period the band members also underwent changes in their personal lives; Armstrong married and had a son, while the drummer Tré Cool and his wife had a daughter. For Armstrong, reaching all these milestones was a surreal experience and he struggled to process these sudden changes, noting that &quot;what I really wanted to do was keep working, and keep writing songs...I didn&#x27;t really stop and smell the roses&quot;.

==Recording==
Much of the album was written and rehearsed in a small, Cape Cod-style home in East Oakland, California. The band decorated the walls with notes underneath song titles jokingly providing instructions for achieving the intended tempo for each track; these included &quot;Must pop Valium for this one&quot; and &quot;Must take crank for this one&quot;. After the birth of Cool and his wife&#x27;s first child, and Cool noted that &quot;I can hit the drums harder than I ever thought I could. Having a kid is trying – you have to watch your temper all the time – but it enhances the experience of playing in the band.&quot;

Eschewing the typical punk rock ethos of creating cheap, low-quality recordings, the band strove to perfect its sound on the record, drawing inspiration from bands such as the Beatles and Cheap Trick. Cool experimented with different cymbal sounds on nearly every song on the album, while Armstrong and producer Rob Cavallo developed the ritual of lining up several guitar amps and testing each one to achieve the desired sound. Much of &quot;Insomniac&quot; was recorded in short, high-energy bursts. Before takes, the group would drink excessive amounts of coffee, &quot;squeeze every last drop of energy&quot; into the recordings, and then rest immediately afterward. Bob Bradshaw of Custom Audio Electronics was employed to apply a thicker guitar sound to the songs.

==Composition==
===Musical style===
David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described &quot;Insomniac&quot; as &quot;14 slices of hearty anarchy, played with a follow-the-bouncing-spitball compactness and vigor.&quot; Ian Winwood of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; wrote of the album&#x27;s &quot;master class in buzzsaw efficiency, the songs are so economical, not to mention harsh, that the removal of even a single chord would cause each composition to collapse in on itself,&quot; calling it &quot;the album on which its creators lost their baby teeth.&quot; Music journalist Andrew Earles said producer Rob Cavallo &quot;helped the band make huge guitar walls out of riffs and grow away from the shiny-happy locker-room dip-shittery of &quot;Dookie&quot;.&quot;

The album features bleaker, more pessimistic lyrics than those of &quot;Dookie&quot;. However, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted that the lyrics exemplify &quot;cold-eyed realism, not trendy nihilism or bleak despair.&quot; Armstrong&#x27;s vocal delivery on the album has been described as an &quot;adenoidal vocal whine.&quot;

===Lyrical themes===
The album begins with &quot;Armatage Shanks&quot;, which explores disassociation and the lack of identity, with Armstrong feeling &quot;Stranded / Lost inside myself.&quot; &quot;When I wrote that song it was right before &quot;Dookie&quot; came out, and I was really at odds with myself,&quot; Armstrong said of it in an interview with &quot;Spin&quot;. &quot;Brat&quot; takes the perspective of a &quot;snot-nosed slob without a job&quot; waiting for his parents to die in order to receive his inheritance. &quot;Stuck with Me&quot;, the second single of the album, talks about the band&#x27;s negative experiences with their newfound fame after releasing &quot;Dookie&quot;, as evidenced by the line ”I&#x27;m not part of your elite, I&#x27;m just alright&quot;. &quot;Geek Stink Breath&quot;, the first single, discusses methamphetamine use, including side effects such as the formation of facial scabs and an accelerated pulse. &quot;No Pride&quot; talks about a narrator at the bottom of society, who doesn&#x27;t mind being there, since he has no pride. The angst-ridden &quot;Bab&#x27;s Uvula Who?&quot; begins with the lyric, &quot;I&#x27;ve got a knack for fucking everything up,&quot; backed by a &quot;brutal, unforgiving wall of sound.&quot; It is followed by &quot;86&quot;, which discusses the rejection Green Day faced from the 924 Gilman Street music club in Berkeley after the band&#x27;s rise to fame in 1994.

&quot;Panic Song&quot; exhibits a pessimistic view of the world, describing it as &quot;a sick machine breeding a mass of shit.&quot; It begins with a &quot;pummeling&quot; instrumental introduction that has been compared to the Who, which lasts for roughly the first two minutes of the three-and-a-half minute-long song. It was inspired by Armstrong&#x27;s panic attacks caused by his anxiety issues and Dirnt&#x27;s panic attacks, which were suffered as a result of being born with an enlarged mitral valve in his heart. Cool tore the calluses on his hand while recording the instrumental intro, and slumped against a wall between takes. Cavallo recalled the musician&#x27;s hands resembled &quot;a bloody mess&quot;. &quot;Brain Stew&quot;, the third and biggest single off of &quot;Insomniac&quot;, talks about insomnia and is quickly followed by &quot;Jaded&quot;. &quot;Westbound Sign&quot; is about Billie&#x27;s wife, Adrienne, moving to California with him. &quot;Tight Wad Hill&quot; talks about how the activities teens once did (like getting high) are not fun anymore. The final track, &quot;Walking Contradiction&quot; was described as an anthem for &quot;anyone who has chafed against the bounds of the demographically correct, computer-coded, image-conscious mid-&#x27;90s.&quot;

==Title and artwork==
Before the name &quot;Insomniac&quot; was decided on, the band considered naming the album &quot;Jesus Christ Supermarket&quot; and &quot;Tight Wad Hill&quot;. &quot;Insomniac&quot; was originally the working title song for &quot;Brain Stew&quot; on demo. After visiting collage artist Winston Smith for the album cover, Billie Joe Armstrong asked him how he managed to make such intricate pieces in such short times. Smith answered: &quot;It&#x27;s easy for me. I am an insomniac.&quot; Armstrong himself has said that the album title comes from his own insomnia, after having been woken up frequently during the night due to his son&#x27;s screams. Armstrong also mentions his insomnia from the perspective of methamphetamine use in the song &quot;Brain Stew&quot;.

The collage on the album cover was created by Smith and is called God Told Me to Skin You Alive, a reference to the Dead Kennedys song &quot;I Kill Children&quot;. The cover art contains an image (the dentist) that was originally used in a collage featured in the inside cover art of Dead Kennedys&#x27; album &quot;Plastic Surgery Disasters&quot; (1982). Smith knew drummer Tré Cool from Green Day&#x27;s time at Lookout! Records and told Cool that if he ever needed album artwork that he should call him. The cover art features several hidden images: a naked woman, three fairies, and several other ghostly faces in the flames. There are also three skulls on the entire album cover and back, one for each member of Green Day. One of the skulls requires the viewer to tilt the piece at an angle. The hidden skull is taken from Hans Holbein&#x27;s 1533 painting &quot;The Ambassadors&quot;. Green Day&#x27;s version, however, is slightly different from the original, with the woman holding Armstrong&#x27;s iconic Sonic Blue Fernandes imitation Stratocaster rather than an acoustic guitar.

==Promotion and tours==
Promotion for &quot;Insomniac&quot; was limited, with a &quot;virtual press blackout&quot;. All of the album&#x27;s singles contained the words &quot;fuck&quot; or &quot;shit&quot; and the music video for &quot;Geek Stink Breath&quot;, showing a methamphetamine addict having his tooth removed, was removed from MTV playlists. This, combined with the &quot;God Told Me to Skin You Alive&quot; cover collage, led Winwood to comment that &quot;everything about &quot;Insomniac&quot; was noticeably different from &quot;Dookie&quot;, yet fully informed by the vast shadow it cast.&quot; Larry Livermore, co-founder of the band&#x27;s former label Lookout Records, found &quot;Insomniac&quot; to be &quot;depressing&quot;, and recalls that he &quot;was even a bit worried about them&quot; upon hearing the single &quot;Brain Stew&quot;. A staff writer for &quot;People&quot; compared the release of &quot;Insomniac&quot; to Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;In Utero&quot; (1993), which featured a darker, less accessible sound in the wake of the success of the band&#x27;s multi-platinum album &quot;Nevermind&quot;.

Green Day also became homesick because touring forced the members to leave behind their families. The band eventually decided to cancel the late 1996 European leg of the &quot;Insomniac&quot; tour to take time off to spend at home. During this time, the band continued to write, and eventually completed over three dozen new songs by the beginning of 1997 for the upcoming album, &quot;Nimrod&quot;. Although the group&#x27;s last effort with producer Rob Cavallo was considered a disappointment, the band did not contemplate choosing anyone else to work with on &quot;Nimrod&quot;, because the members viewed Cavallo as a &quot;mentor&quot;.

==Release and commercial performance==
&quot;Insomniac&quot; debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, selling over 171,000 copies its first week of release. The first single released from &quot;Insomniac&quot; was &quot;Geek Stink Breath&quot;. The song was successful on both Top 40 and rock radio stations and peaked at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay. The second single, released exclusively in the United Kingdom, was &quot;Stuck with Me&quot;. The song was moderately successful in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, but was not one of the group&#x27;s bigger hits in the US. The third single from the album was &quot;Brain Stew/Jaded&quot;. The two were separate songs (tracks 10 and 11 on &quot;Insomniac&quot;), but they were released together as a single and a music video. The song &quot;Walking Contradiction&quot; was released as a promotional single in August to promote the album, while &quot;86&quot; was only released as a promotional single in Spain and Germany. 

=== Deluxe edition ===
In 2021, For the 25th year anniversary, Green Day made a deluxe version of the album, which includes eight tracks from &quot;Live in Prague&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Insomniac&quot; did not have the big sales or airplay as the singles from &quot;Dookie&quot;, but it was generally well received by critics. It earned three and a half out of five stars from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which said &quot;In punk the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a B with particular praise for Billie Joe Armstrong, stating that: &quot;Fans needn&#x27;t worry about Armstrong, a new father, rhapsodizing over the joys of changing diapers or whining about being a wealthy rock star. Once more, the songs relate the travails of a pathetic, self-loathing goofball whose sense of self-worth is continually reduced to rubble by sundry jerks, authority figures, and cultural elitists.&quot;

However, Green Day was slightly criticized for not progressing as much as their predecessors. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated that: &quot;&quot;Insomniac&quot; does make you wonder about Green Day&#x27;s growth, though. Between albums one and four, The Clash, to take an old-school example, branched out from guitar crunch to reggae, dub, and Spectorized pop. By comparison, Green Day sound exactly the same as on their first album, albeit with crisper production and, ominously, a palpable degeneration in their sense of humor. The few hints of growth are fairly microscopic: a tougher metallic edge to a few of the songs ... and lyrics that are bleaker than &quot;Dookie&quot;&#x27;s.&quot;

AllMusic similarly noted that &quot;they kept their blueprint and made it a shade darker. Throughout &quot;Insomniac&quot;, there are vague references to the band&#x27;s startling multi-platinum breakthrough, but the album is hardly a stark confessional on the level of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;In Utero&quot;. ... While nothing on the album is as immediate as &quot;Basket Case&quot; or &quot;Longview,&quot; the band has gained a powerful sonic punch, which goes straight for the gut but sacrifices the raw edge they so desperately want to keep and makes the record slightly tame. Billie Joe hasn&#x27;t lost much of his talent for simple, tuneful hooks, but after a series of songs that all sound pretty much the same, it becomes clear that he needs to push himself a little bit more if Green Day ever want to be something more than a good punk-pop band. As it is, they remain a good punk-pop band, and &quot;Insomniac&quot; is a good punk-pop record, but nothing more.&quot; Robert Christgau opined &quot;[Armstrong&#x27;s] songs conceptualize his natural whine with a musicality that undercuts his defeatism.&quot;

The album was included at number 8 on &quot;Rock Sound&quot;″s &quot;The 51 Most Essential Pop Punk Albums of All Time&quot; list.
==Legacy==
Despite being considered a commercial disappointment, Armstrong noted, &quot;Insomniac did a lot better than I thought it was going to do...From the sound of it, we knew it wasn&#x27;t going to sell as much as &quot;Dookie&quot;.&quot; The group embarked on an extensive world tour to promote &quot;Insomniac&quot; in early 1996, which saw the band performing in sports arenas that contrasted with the small clubs the group was accustomed to playing. The members became increasingly uncomfortable with the level of stardom they had attained; Armstrong recalled, &quot;We were becoming the things we hated, playing those big arenas. It was beginning to be not fun anymore.&quot;

Music journalist Andrew Earles referred to the album&#x27;s third single &quot;Brain Stew&quot; as &quot;one of the better mainstream radio moments&quot; of the decade.

<doc id="101941" wikidata="Q659219" url="?curid=101941" title="Mall of America">
<text>Mall of America (MoA) is a large shopping mall located in Bloomington, Minnesota. Located within the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area, the mall lies southeast of the junction of Interstate 494 and Minnesota State Highway 77, north of the Minnesota River, and across the Interstate from the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. It opened in 1992, and is the largest mall in the United States, the largest in the Western Hemisphere, and the twelfth largest shopping mall in the world.

The mall is managed by the Triple Five Group (which in turn is owned by the Ghermezian family, along with the West Edmonton Mall and the American Dream). Approximately 40 million people visit the mall annually, 80% of whom are from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, the Dakotas, Illinois and Ohio.

==History==
The mall&#x27;s concept was designed by the Triple Five Group in conjunction with global design firm DLR Group, owned by the Ghermezian brothers, who also own the second-largest shopping mall in North America, the West Edmonton Mall. The Mall of America is located on the site of the former Metropolitan Stadium, where the Minnesota Vikings and Minnesota Twins played until the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome opened in 1982. A plaque in the mall&#x27;s amusement park commemorates the former location of home plate and one seat from Met Stadium was placed in Mall of America at the exact location it occupied in the stadium, commemorating a home run hit by hall-of-famer Harmon Killebrew on June 3, 1967.

In 1986, the Bloomington Port Authority signed an agreement with the Ghermezian organization. Groundbreaking for the mall took place on June 14, 1989. Organizations involved include Melvin Simon and Associates, Teachers Insurance and Annuity, and the office of architect Jon Jerde.

Mall of America opened its doors to the public on August 11, 1992. Its anchors were Nordstrom, Macy&#x27;s, Bloomingdale&#x27;s and Sears. Even before opening, the mall had earned several nicknames, including &quot;The Megamall&quot;, &quot;Sprawl of America&quot;, &quot;Hugedale&quot; in reference to the four major &quot;dale&quot; shopping malls within the Twin Cities: Rosedale, Southdale, Ridgedale and the now-defunct Brookdale.

Mall of America became the largest shopping mall in total area and largest in total store vendors in the United States when it opened. The Mall of America&#x27;s 42 million annual visitors equal roughly eight times the population of the state of Minnesota. , the mall employed over 11,000 workers year-round and 13,000 during peak seasons.

In early 2020, Mall of America closed for a period of twelve weeks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, closing on March 17, and reopening on June 10 with only 150 tenants open for business. The mall was originally scheduled to reopen on June 1, but civil unrest in the Twin Cities around this time caused the mall to postpone the reopening.

=== Legal battle ===
In 2003, after a protracted six-year legal battle between Simon Property Group, the managing general partner of the property, and the Ghermezian brothers/Triple Five Group, over majority ownership of the site, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of the Ghermezians, effectively transferring control and planning authority of the mall back to the creator of the concept. The dispute stemmed from a 1999 purchase of Teacher&#x27;s Insurance&#x27;s 27.5% equity stake by Simon Properties, giving them majority ownership. The Ghermezians claimed they were never told of the deal and sued Simon, citing fiduciary responsibility. On November 3, 2006, the Ghermezians gained full control of Mall of America by spending US$1 billion.

=== Expansions ===

On May 18, 2008, the Mall of America received a tax break for a proposed $2 billion expansion. The bill gave the city of Bloomington the ability to increase taxes on sales, lodging and food and beverages to finance a parking ramp at the mall. On March 24, 2012, the Triple Five Group, partnered with architectural firm DLR Group, announced the start of a $200 million expansion that would build into the north parking lot of the mall. The plans called for an additional hotel and an additional of retail space. The project broke ground in the fall of 2013 and began opening in stages in the summer of 2015. In March 2014, ground was broken on the mall&#x27;s north side for the $104 million, 14-story JW Marriott hotel, owned and financed by the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community. In 2018, it was announced that MOA had proposed to build an indoor water park, with a cost between $150 and $200 million for the project. In March 2022, the plan was approved by the Bloomington City Council.

==Architecture==
The Mall of America has a gross area of or , and of retail space. The mall is nearly symmetric, with a roughly rectangular floor plan. More than 500 stores are arranged along three levels of pedestrian walkways on the sides of the rectangle, with a 4th level on the south and east sides. Four anchor department stores are located at the corners. The mall is organized into four different zones. Each of those zones had its own decorative style until a series of renovations from 2010 to 2015 led to a unified and more luxurious style, as well as to coincide with the mall&#x27;s first major expansion. The mall&#x27;s food court is on the 3rd floor.

Despite Minnesota&#x27;s cold winters, only the mall&#x27;s entrances and some below ground areas are heated. Heat is allowed in through skylights above the central amusement park area. The majority of the heat is produced by lighting fixtures, other electric devices and people in the mall. In fact, even during the winter, air conditioning systems may still be in use during peak hours to ensure a comfortable shopping environment. Although the common areas are unheated, the individual stores do have heating systems.

Two nearly identical seven-story parking ramps on the east and west sides of the mall provide 12,287 parking spaces. Overflow parking north of the building provides an additional 1,200–1,500 spaces and 1,407 spaces are provided by IKEA, which opened in July 2004.

==Tenants==
During its run as an all-encompassing entertainment and retail venue, certain aspects, particularly its bars, have come under scrutiny. In early 2000, a Mardi Gras-themed bar, Fat Tuesday, shut its doors due to indecent exposure and alcohol-related offenses. On November 29, 2011, Google announced indoor maps for Mall of America along with several other places like airports, parks, and public spaces. On January 3, 2012, Macy&#x27;s Inc. announced it would close its Bloomingdale&#x27;s location at the Mall of America after nearly two decades.

The Theatres at Mall of America opened three days after the grand opening of the mall. Initially, the cinema was run by General Cinema, but it was bought out then rebranded by AMC Theatres, and eventually operated by mall management. The cinema occupied the south side of the fourth floor through December 2016, when it closed permanently. It was replaced by Cinemex subsidiary CMX Cinemas in late 2017. Due to CMX Cinema&#x27;s bankruptcy proceedings, CMX Mall of America closed down and replaced with B&amp;B Theatres in 2021.

On December 28, 2018, it was announced that Sears (which had been at the Mall of America since its opening in 1992) would be closing as part of a plan to close 80 stores nationwide.

Currently, the mall features Macy&#x27;s, Nordstrom, L.L. Bean, and Crayola Experience as its anchors, along with the vacant anchor space formerly occupied by Sears.

There are also many junior anchors, like Forever 21, H&amp;M, Barnes &amp; Noble, Nordstorm Rack, and DSW. Former junior anchors include Best Buy, Marshalls, and American Girl, with the latter being replaced with a 24,000-square-foot M&amp;M&#x27;s retail store, which opened in late 2020.

There are also two hotels on the mall&#x27;s property, JW Marriott Minneapolis Mall of America and Radisson Blu Hotel.

In 2023 a Toys &quot;R&quot; Us opened in the mall. 

==Attractions==
Nickelodeon Universe, formerly Camp Snoopy, is an indoor theme park in the center of the mall. The park features roller coasters, among numerous other rides and attractions, including many not related to Nickelodeon, and is the largest indoor theme park in the United States. Unlike many indoor amusement parks, Nickelodeon Universe has a great deal of natural foliage in and about the park, and its floor has a wide variance in height – the highest ground level in the park is above the lowest. The rides include the roller coasters SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge, Fairly Odd Coaster, Back at the Barnyard Hayride and , and a thrill ride called BrainSurge. It also has a miniature golfing section called Moose Mountain. This miniature golf course features eighteen holes and a relatively fast astroturf surface.

At the Sea Life Minnesota Aquarium, guests travel through a curved tunnel through of water to view over 4,500 sea creatures including sharks, turtles, stingrays and many more. Sea Life Minnesota Aquarium offers special events such as sleepovers, scuba diving, snorkeling and birthday parties.

==Nostalgic artifacts and memorials==
*A stadium seat commemorating the longest home run at Metropolitan Stadium, hit by Minnesota Twins player Harmon Killebrew on June 3, 1967. The seat is painted red and bolted to a wall to mark the exact height and position at which the ball landed in the upper-deck seats.
*A plaque embedded in the floor of Nickelodeon Universe, marking the spot of the home plate at Metropolitan Stadium. 
*A second plaque was added to the floor of Nickelodeon Universe in 2018, marking the spot on the 50-yard line at Metropolitan Stadium that was used for the coin toss before every Minnesota Vikings home game played there.
*The United Airlines Flight 93 memorial, in honor of those who died aboard that flight during the September 11 attacks. A bust of Tom Burnett (who was born and raised in Bloomington) stands on the west side of the first floor, next to the fountain in front of Nordstrom.

==Transit==
In the lower level of the eastern parking ramp is the Mall of America station, the busiest transit hub in Minnesota with services to and from many destinations in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area. The Transit Station contains two stops on the Metro Network: the southern terminus of the METRO Blue Line (light rail) to Downtown Minneapolis via MSP Airport and Hiawatha Avenue (operated by Metro Transit), and the northern terminus of the METRO Red Line (bus rapid transit) to Apple Valley. The indoor waiting area at Mall of America Transit Station is open daily from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Metro Transit and the MVTA also operate many local bus services to the Transit Station and many area hotels along with the Mystic Lake Casino Hotel offer free shuttles to their establishments.

The mall is not a park and ride facility, and overnight parking is banned to prevent passengers taking the train to the airport. Commuters are required to use the nearby 30th Avenue station&#x27;s parking ramp. The station underwent a $25 million upgrade which was completed in October 2019.

==Safety and security==

=== Security personnel ===
Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs) are trained in Israel, each one going through at least 240 hours of training. As Doug Reynolds, the former Security Director at the mall noted in a congressional testimony in 2008, BDOs are taught to &quot;look for intent, rather than means. The objective is to focus on suspicious indicators in three categories: People, vehicles, and unattended items like backpacks, shopping bags, and suitcases.&quot; This methodology has prepared the mall for a variety of threats, both from terrorists and everyday criminals.

In 2010, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported that mall security officials were instructed to question or detain individuals exhibiting what they deemed &quot;suspicious behavior&quot;. Signs of suspicious behavior included photographing air-conditioning ducts, or signs that a shopper was hiding something. At the time, some officials within the Bloomington Police Department worried that the mall&#x27;s security methods may infringe peoples&#x27; rights.

In 2011, NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; and &quot;Morning Edition&quot; and PBS&#x27;s &quot;NewsHour&quot; both aired programs documenting security abuses by the mall&#x27;s security personnel. On December 31, 2013, members from the First Nations protest movement Idle No More attempted to repeat a successful Native-American round dance held at the mall in 2012, but failed after being stopped by mall security. Organizers of the dance, Patricia Shepard and Reyna Crow from Duluth were arrested on site for trespassing.

In January 2023, a TikTok of was posted of a man wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan &quot;Jesus saves&quot; and the Coexist (image) logo crossed out being asked to either take it off or leave the mall, the member of security in the video saying &quot;Jesus is associated with religion and it is offending people. People have been offended.&quot; In the video he stated that in another instance he was preaching in the mall and the mall has a policy against religious solicitation. 

=== Militant threat ===
In February 2015, the al-Shabaab militant group also released a propaganda video calling for attacks on the Mall of America and other Western shopping centers. Although the group had never launched attacks in North America, security at the mall was tightened in response and the Department of Homeland Security issued a one-day alert to shoppers to remain vigilant.

=== Protests ===
On December 21, 2014, thousands of protesters attended an unauthorized demonstration organized by Black Lives Matter in the mall&#x27;s rotunda. The demonstration was in response to the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and the then recent jury decision not to prosecute the white officer in that case, as well as the death of Eric Garner of New York. In response to the demonstration, the Mall of America closed the areas of the mall around the rotunda. Police arrested 25 demonstrators. The Bloomington City Attorney, Sandra Johnson, pursued charges against the organizers, and the city is sought compensatory damages from some of the organizers for out-of-pocket costs the city incurred while paying overtime for additional security. In response to these charges, demonstrators have called for a boycott of the mall.

Plans for another Black Lives Matter demonstration at the Mall of America on December 23, 2015, prompted mall officials to file a restraining order against the movement&#x27;s activists. Eight individual activists were sued in Hennepin County District Court. The mall&#x27;s lawsuit would prohibit the defendants from demonstrating and require them to delete all of their posts to social media pertaining to the demonstration. The lawsuit additionally asked that the court jail Black Lives Matter activists unless they publicly announce that the demonstration is cancelled on their social media accounts. The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota called the mall&#x27;s lawsuit an &quot;improper prior restraint on speech&quot; and an unconstitutional overreach.

=== Notable criminal incidents ===
====2019 murder attempt====

On April 12, 2019, a five-year-old boy was thrown from the third-story balcony by 24-year-old Emmanuel Deshawn Aranda of Minneapolis, outside the Rainforest Cafe, and landed near the Michael Kors store. The boy was in the hospital for over five months, but eventually recovered. Aranda was sentenced to 19 years in prison in June of that year with the possibility for parole after 12 years.

====2021 shooting====
On December 31, 2021, a single gunshot was fired on the north side of the third floor of the mall. A patrolling Bloomington Police Department officer who heard the shot immediately notified mall security, who activated the mall&#x27;s lockdown alarm. Responding officers found a man who had been shot in the leg when they arrived at the scene and later another injured person was found who appeared to have been grazed by the bullet. The first victim was transported to the hospital while the second was treated on the scene by paramedics and released. According to a statement by Deputy Chief Kim Clausen, she recommended that there was an &quot;altercation&quot; between two men that resulted in one shooting the other. After a thorough search of the mall by police and security officers, the lockdown was lifted approximately 40 minutes after it started and the mall closed for the rest of the day shortly thereafter.

On January 3, 2022, an 18-year-old Roseville man was identified as they left the scene of the shooting with the shooter was arrested for aiding and abetting first-degree assault, and on January 4, police arrested the suspect on assault charges and in a subsequent search of the house found a gun. In March, 2022, the man, Kahlil Wiley, pleaded guilty to one count of second degree assault with a dangerous weapon and was sentenced to three years and nine months. The second assault charge against him was previously dismissed.

====August 2022 shooting====
On August 4, 2022, the mall was put under lockdown after two men fired gunshots during an altercation at the Nike store, then fled. Two-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Kyle Busch was in the mall with his family at the time; they were unharmed. The two alleged shooters were apprehended a week later in Chicago. They were detained shortly after stepping out of a barbershop. Three people were also arrested for allegedly aiding the shooters as they fled the scene and hid from authorities at a nearby Best Western hotel. Two of the suspects originated from Minneapolis, while the other three originated from Burnsville, all between the ages of 21 and 23.

====December 2022 fatal shooting====
On December 23, 2022, the mall was placed under lockdown after a &quot;long-standing feud&quot; led to the fatal shooting of a 19-year old male inside the Nordstrom department store. A bullet grazed a bystander&#x27;s clothing resulting in only minor injuries. Two teenagers, TaeShawn Adams-Wright and Lavon Longstreet, were later convicted of second degree-murder and second-degree assault for the shooting. Both were sentenced in 2024 to 30 years and seven months in prison.

==In media==
The Mall of America was used as a filming location for various movies and television shows, including:
*&quot;D2: The Mighty Ducks&quot; (1994)
*&quot;D3: The Mighty Ducks&quot; (1996)
*Hosted the first episode of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; on September 4, 1995.
*&quot;Jingle All the Way&quot; (1996)
*&quot;You&#x27;re Invited to Mary-Kate &amp; Ashley&#x27;s Mall Party&quot; (1997)
*&quot;Mall Masters&quot; (2001)
*&quot;Viva la Bam&quot; (2003–2006)
*&quot;Mall Cops: Mall of America&quot; (2010)
*&quot;The End of the Tour&quot; (2015)

The mall was referenced in the series &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; during the episode &quot;Slap Bet&quot; as the reason why native Minnesotan Marshall Eriksen believed that Robin Scherbatsky would have been married in a mall; this is a reference to the Chapel of Love in the mall, which closed in August 2022. The mall was the location of the premiere of &quot;&quot; (2000). The mall was also referenced in the series &quot;Reginald the Vampire&quot; in the episode &quot;Reginald Andres Beyond Thunderdome&quot; by the character Ashley who was quoted as saying &quot;I was born on the day they broke ground for the largest shopping mall in America.&quot;

In the Lifter Puller song &quot;Bloomington&quot;, singer Craig Finn (a Minnesota native) refers to the mall as a place where the narrator conducts some of their illicit business: &quot;His idea of fun is Bloomington, he always takes his calls at the megamall&quot;.

<text>Child labour is the exploitation of children through any form of work that interferes with their ability to attend regular school, or is mentally, physically, socially and morally harmful. Such exploitation is prohibited by legislation worldwide, although these laws do not consider all work by children as child labour; exceptions include work by child artists, family duties, supervised training, and some forms of work undertaken by Amish children, as well as by Indigenous children in the Americas.

Child labour has existed to varying extents throughout history. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, many children aged 5–14 from poorer families worked in Western nations and their colonies alike. These children mainly worked in agriculture, home-based assembly operations, factories, mining, and services such as news boys—some worked night shifts lasting 12 hours. With the rise of household income, availability of schools and passage of child labour laws, the incidence rates of child labour fell.

, in the world&#x27;s poorest countries, around one in five children are engaged in child labour, the highest number of whom live in sub-saharan Africa, where more than one in four children are so engaged. This represents a decline in child labour over the preceding half decade. In 2017, four African nations (Mali, Benin, Chad and Guinea-Bissau) witnessed over 50 per cent of children aged 5–14 working. Worldwide agriculture is the largest employer of child labour. The vast majority of child labour is found in rural settings and informal urban economies; children are predominantly employed by their parents, rather than factories. Poverty and lack of schools are considered the primary cause of child labour. UNICEF notes that &quot;boys and girls are equally likely to be involved in child labour&quot;, but in different roles, girls being substantially more likely to perform unpaid household labour.

Globally the incidence of child labour decreased from 25% to 10% between 1960 and 2003, according to the World Bank. Nevertheless, the total number of child labourers remains high, with UNICEF and ILO acknowledging an estimated 168 million children aged 5–17 worldwide were involved in child labour in 2013.

== History ==
===Preindustrial societies===
Child labour forms an intrinsic part of pre-industrial economies. In pre-industrial societies, there is rarely a concept of childhood in the modern sense. Children often begin to actively participate in activities such as child rearing, hunting and farming as soon as they are competent. In many societies, children as young as 13 are seen as adults and engage in the same activities as adults.

The work of children was important in pre-industrial societies, as children needed to provide their labour for their survival and that of their group. Pre-industrial societies were characterised by low productivity and short life expectancy; preventing children from participating in productive work would be more harmful to their welfare and that of their group in the long run. In pre-industrial societies, there was little need for children to attend school. This is especially the case in non-literate societies. Most pre-industrial skill and knowledge were amenable to being passed down through direct mentoring or apprenticing by competent adults.

===Industrial Revolution===


With the onset of the Industrial Revolution in Britain in the late 18th century, there was a rapid increase in the industrial exploitation of labour, including child labour. Industrial cities such as Birmingham, Manchester, and Liverpool rapidly grew from small villages into large cities and improving child mortality rates. These cities drew in the population that was rapidly growing due to increased agricultural output. This process was replicated in other industrialising countries.

The Victorian era in particular became notorious for the conditions under which children were employed. Children as young as four were employed in production factories and mines working long hours in dangerous, often fatal, working conditions. In coal mines, children would crawl through tunnels too narrow and low for adults. Children also worked as errand boys, crossing sweepers, shoe blacks, or selling matches, flowers and other cheap goods. Some children undertook work as apprentices to respectable trades, such as building or as domestic servants (there were over 120,000 domestic servants in London in the mid-18th century). Working hours were long: builders worked 64 hours a week in the summer and 52 hours in winter, while servants worked 80-hour weeks.

Child labour played an important role in the Industrial Revolution from its outset, often brought about by economic hardship. The children of the poor were expected to contribute to their family income. In 19th-century Great Britain, one-third of poor families were without a breadwinner, as a result of death or abandonment, obliging many children to work from a young age. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered cotton mills were described as children. A high number of children also worked as prostitutes. The author Charles Dickens worked at the age of 12 in a blacking factory, with his family in a debtor&#x27;s prison.

Child wages were often low, the wages were as little as 10–20% of an adult male&#x27;s wage. Karl Marx was an outspoken opponent of child labour, saying British industries &quot;could but live by sucking blood, and children&#x27;s blood too&quot;, and that U.S. capital was financed by the &quot;capitalized blood of children&quot;. Letitia Elizabeth Landon castigated child labour in her 1835 poem &quot;The Factory&quot;, portions of which she pointedly included in her 18th Birthday Tribute to Princess Victoria in 1837.

Throughout the second half of the 19th century, child labour began to decline in industrialised societies due to regulation and economic factors because of the Growth of trade unions. The regulation of child labour began from the earliest days of the Industrial Revolution. The first act to regulate child labour in Britain was passed in 1803. As early as 1802 and 1819 Factory Acts were passed to regulate the working hours of workhouse children in factories and cotton mills to 12 hours per day. These acts were largely ineffective and after radical agitation, by for example the &quot;Short Time Committees&quot; in 1831, a Royal Commission recommended in 1833 that children aged 11–18 should work a maximum of 12 hours per day, children aged 9–11 a maximum of eight hours, and children under the age of nine were no longer permitted to work. This act however only applied to the textile industry, and further agitation led to another act in 1847 limiting both adults and children to 10-hour working days. Lord Shaftesbury was an outspoken advocate of regulating child labour.

As technology improved and proliferated, there was a greater need for educated employees. This saw an increase in schooling, with the eventual introduction of compulsory schooling. Improved technology, automation and further legislation significantly reduced child labour particularly in western Europe and the U.S.
According to Colin Heywood, reform oriented historians on the left developed an interpretation of child labour in the industrial West along these line: 

It begins with the dragooning of large numbers of young people into textile mills, mines, and factories spawned by early industrialization, with new machinery making it possible to substitute women and children for adult male workers. Conditions in the workshops were grim, with the familiar tale of long hours to match the relentless pace of the machines, a damp and dusty environment, and a heartless disciplinary regime. . . . A disparate group of reformers stepped forward at this point, to combat abuses with legislation, including hardheaded businessmen interested in maximizing profits, more philanthropically minded representatives of the landed gentry and professional classes, and, in the American case, leaders of organized labor. Gradually, by a process of trial and error, the state managed to curb some of the excesses of child labor, notably excluding younger age-groups from workshops, overcoming opposition from many industrialists and working-class parents in the process. Child labor thereby emerges as at its most abusive during the early, or “dirty,” phase of industrialization, and gradually disappears in developed economies as the state manages to force children out of the workshops and into schools.

===Early 20th century===
In the early 20th century, thousands of boys were employed in glass making industries. Glass making was a dangerous and tough job especially without the current technologies. The process of making glass includes intense heat to melt glass (). When the boys are at work, they are exposed to this heat. This could cause eye trouble, lung ailments, heat exhaustion, cuts, and burns. Since workers were paid by the piece, they had to work productively for hours without a break. Since furnaces had to be constantly burning, there were night shifts from 5:00 pm to 3:00 am. Many factory owners preferred boys under 16 years of age.

An estimated 1.7 million children under the age of fifteen were employed in American industry by 1900.

In 1910, over 2 million children in the same age group were employed in the United States. This included children who rolled cigarettes, engaged in factory work, worked as bobbin doffers in textile mills, worked in coal mines and were employed in canneries. Lewis Hine&#x27;s photographs of child labourers in the 1910s powerfully evoked the plight of working children in the American south. Hine took these photographs between 1908 and 1917 as the staff photographer for the National Child Labor Committee.

====Household enterprises====
Factories and mines were not the only places where child labour was prevalent in the early 20th century. Home-based manufacturing across the United States and Europe employed children as well. Governments and reformers argued that labour in factories must be regulated and the state had an obligation to provide welfare for poor. Legislation that followed had the effect of moving work out of factories into urban homes. Families and women, in particular, preferred it because it allowed them to generate income while taking care of household duties.

Home-based manufacturing operations were active year-round. Families willingly deployed their children in these income generating home enterprises. In many cases, men worked from home. In France, over 58% of garment workers operated out of their homes; in Germany, the number of full-time home operations nearly doubled between 1882 and 1907; and in the United States, millions of families operated out of home seven days a week, year round to produce garments, shoes, artificial flowers, feathers, match boxes, toys, umbrellas and other products. Children aged 5–14 worked alongside the parents. Home-based operations and child labour in Australia, Britain, Austria and other parts of the world was common. Rural areas similarly saw families deploying their children in agriculture. In 1946, Frieda S. Miller – then Director of the United States Department of Labor – told the International Labour Organization (ILO) that these home-based operations offered &quot;low wages, long hours, child labour, unhealthy and insanitary working conditions&quot;.

===21st century===

Child labour is still common in many parts of the world. Estimates for child labour vary. It ranges between 250 and 304 million, if children aged 5–17 involved in any economic activity are counted. If light occasional work is excluded, ILO estimates there were 153 million child labourers aged 5–14 worldwide in 2008. This is about 20 million less than ILO estimate for child labourers in 2004. Some 60 per cent of the child labour was involved in agricultural activities such as farming, dairy, fisheries and forestry. Another 25% of child labourers were in service activities such as retail, hawking goods, restaurants, load and transfer of goods, storage, picking and recycling trash, polishing shoes, domestic help, and other services. The remaining 15% laboured in assembly and manufacturing in informal economy, home-based enterprises, factories, mines, packaging salt, operating machinery, and such operations. Two out of three child workers work alongside their parents, in unpaid family work situations. Some children work as guides for tourists, sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and restaurants. Child labour predominantly occurs in the rural areas (70%) and informal urban sector (26%).

Contrary to popular belief, most child labourers are employed by their parents rather than in manufacturing or formal economy. Children who work for pay or in-kind compensation are usually found in rural settings as opposed to urban centres. Less than 3% of child labour aged 5–14 across the world work outside their household, or away from their parents.

Child labour accounts for 22% of the workforce in Asia, 32% in Africa, 17% in Latin America, 1% in the US, Canada, Europe and other wealthy nations. The proportion of child labourers varies greatly among countries and even regions inside those countries. Africa has the highest percentage of children aged 5–17 employed as child labour, and a total of over 65 million. Asia, with its larger population, has the largest number of children employed as child labour at about 114 million. Latin America and the Caribbean region have lower overall population density, but at 14 million child labourers has high incidence rates too.
Accurate present day child labour information is difficult to obtain because of disagreements between data sources as to what constitutes child labour. In some countries, government policy contributes to this difficulty. For example, the overall extent of child labour in China is unclear due to the government categorising child labour data as &quot;highly secret&quot;. China has enacted regulations to prevent child labour; still, the practice of child labour is reported to be a persistent problem within China, generally in agriculture and low-skill service sectors as well as small workshops and manufacturing enterprises.

In 2014, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a &quot;List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor&quot;, where China was attributed 12 goods, the majority of which were produced by both underage children and indentured labourers. The report listed electronics, garments, toys, and coal, among other goods.

The Maplecroft Child Labour Index 2012 survey reports that 76 countries pose extreme child labour complicity risks for companies operating worldwide. The ten highest risk countries in 2012, ranked in decreasing order, were: Myanmar, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, DR Congo, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, Burundi, Pakistan and Ethiopia. Of the major growth economies, Maplecroft ranked Philippines 25th riskiest, India 27th, China 36th, Vietnam 37th, Indonesia 46th, and Brazil 54th, all of them rated to involve extreme risks of child labour uncertainties, to corporations seeking to invest in developing world and import products from emerging markets.

==Causes==

The ILO suggests that poverty is the greatest single cause behind child labour. For impoverished households, income from a child&#x27;s work is usually crucial for his or her own survival or for that of the household. Income from working children, even if small, may be between 25 and 40% of the household income. Other scholars such as Harsch on African child labour, and Edmonds and Pavcnik on global child labour have reached the same conclusion.

While poverty is a significant factor, the relationship between poverty and child labor is complex. Research suggests that child labor generally decreases as household productive wealth (measured by agricultural per capita land holding in rural areas) increases. However, there can be a significant spike in the relationship between child labor and landholding at moderate levels of land per capita. 

Lack of meaningful alternatives, such as affordable schools and quality education, according to the ILO, is another major factor driving children to harmful labour. Children work because they have nothing better to do. Many communities, particularly rural areas where between 60 and 70% of child labour is prevalent, do not possess adequate school facilities. Even when schools are sometimes available, they are too far away, difficult to reach, unaffordable or the quality of education is so poor that parents wonder if going to school is really worth it.

===Cultural factors===
In European history when child labour was common, as well as in contemporary child labour of modern world, certain cultural beliefs have grounded it. Some view that work is good for the character-building and skill development of children. In many cultures, particular where the informal economy and small household businesses thrive, the cultural tradition is that children follow in their parents&#x27; footsteps; child labour then is a means to learn and practice that trade from a very early age. Similarly, in many cultures the education of girls is less valued or girls are simply not expected to need formal schooling, and these girls pushed into child labour such as providing domestic services.

===Macroeconomics===
Biggeri and Mehrotra have studied the macroeconomic factors that encourage child labour. They focus their study on five Asian nations including India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines. They suggest that child labour is a serious problem in all five, but it is not a new problem. Macroeconomic causes encouraged widespread child labour across the world, over most of human history. They suggest that the causes for child labour include both the demand and the supply side. While poverty and unavailability of good schools explain the child labour supply side, they suggest that the growth of low-paying informal economy rather than higher paying formal economy is amongst the causes of the demand side. Other scholars too suggest that inflexible labour market, size of informal economy, inability of industries to scale up and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major macroeconomic factors affecting demand and acceptability of child labour.

== By country ==
===Colonial empires===
Systematic use of child labour was commonplace in the colonies of European powers between 1650 and 1950. In Africa, colonial administrators encouraged traditional kin-ordered modes of production, that is hiring a household for work not just the adults. Millions of children worked in colonial agricultural plantations, mines and domestic service industries. Sophisticated schemes were promulgated where children in these colonies between the ages of 5 and 14 were hired as an apprentice without pay in exchange for learning a craft. A system of Pauper Apprenticeship came into practice in the 19th century where the colonial master neither needed the native parents&#x27; nor child&#x27;s approval to assign a child to labour, away from parents, at a distant farm owned by a different colonial master. Other schemes included &#x27;earn-and-learn&#x27; programs where children would work and thereby learn. Britain for example passed a law, the so-called Masters and Servants Act of 1899, followed by Tax and Pass Law, to encourage child labour in colonies particularly in Africa. These laws offered the native people the legal ownership to some of the native land in exchange for making labour of wife and children available to colonial government&#x27;s needs such as in farms and as &quot;picannins&quot;.

Beyond laws, new taxes were imposed on colonies. One of these taxes was the Head Tax in the British and French colonial empires. The tax was imposed on everyone older than 8 years, in some colonies. To pay these taxes and cover living expenses, children in colonial households had to work.

In southeast Asian colonies, such as Hong Kong, child labour such as the &quot;Mui tsai&quot; (妹仔), was rationalised as a cultural tradition and ignored by British authorities. The Dutch East India Company officials rationalised their child labour abuses with, &quot;it is a way to save these children from a worse fate.&quot; Christian mission schools in regions stretching from Zambia to Nigeria too required work from children, and in exchange provided religious education, not secular education. Elsewhere, the Canadian Dominion Statutes in form of so-called Breaches of Contract Act, stipulated jail terms for uncooperative child workers.

Proposals to regulate child labour began as early as 1786.

=== Africa ===
Children working at a young age has been a consistent theme throughout Africa. Many children began first working in the home to help their parents run the family farm. Children in Africa today are often forced into exploitative labour due to family debt and other financial factors, leading to ongoing poverty. Other types of domestic child labour include working in commercial plantations, begging, and other sales such as boot shining. In total, there is an estimated five million children who are currently working in the field of agriculture which steadily increases during the time of harvest. Along with 30% of children who are picking coffee, there are an estimated 25,000 school age children who work year round.
What industries children work in depends on whether they grew up in a rural area or an urban area. Children who were born in urban areas often found themselves working for street vendors, washing cars, helping in construction sites, weaving clothing, and sometimes even working as exotic dancers. While children who grew up in rural areas would work on farms doing physical labour, working with animals, and selling crops. Many children can also be found working in hazardous environments, with some using bare hands, stones and hammers to take apart CRT-based televisions and computer monitors. Of all the child workers, the most serious cases involved street children and trafficked children due to the physical and emotional abuse they endured by their employers. To address the issue of child labour, the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child Act was implemented in 1959. Yet due to poverty, lack of education and ignorance, the legal actions were not/are not wholly enforced or accepted in Africa.
Other legal factors that have been implemented to end and reduce child labour includes the global response that came into force in 1979 by the declaration of the International Year of the Child. Along with the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations, these two declarations worked on many levels to eliminate child labour. Although many actions have been taken to end this epidemic, child labour in Africa is still an issue today due to the unclear definition of adolescence and how much time is needed for children to engage in activities that are crucial for their development. Another issue that often comes into play is the link between what constitutes as child labour within the household due to the cultural acceptance of children helping run the family business. In the end, there is a consistent challenge for the national government to strengthen its grip politically on child labour, and to increase education and awareness on the issue of children working below the legal age limit. With children playing an important role in the African economy, child labour still plays an important role for many in the 20th century.

=== Australia ===
From European settlement in 1788, child convicts were occasionally sent to Australia where they were made to work. Child labour was not as excessive in Australia as in Britain. With a low population, agricultural productivity was higher and families did not face starvation as in established industrialised countries. Australia also did not have significant industry until the later part of the 20th century, when child labour laws and compulsory schooling had developed under the influence of Britain. From the 1870s, child labour was restricted by compulsory schooling.

Child labour laws in Australia differ from state to state. Generally, children are allowed to work at any age, but restrictions exist for children under 15 years of age. These restrictions apply to work hours and the type of work that children can perform. In all states, children are obliged to attend school until a minimum leaving age, 15 years of age in all states except Tasmania and Queensland where the leaving age is 17.

=== Brazil ===

Child labour has been a consistent struggle for children in Brazil ever since Portuguese colonisation in the region began in 1500. Work that many children took part in was not always visible, legal, or paid. Free or slave labour was a common occurrence for many youths and was a part of their everyday lives as they grew into adulthood. Yet due to there being no clear definition of how to classify what a child or youth is, there has been little historical documentation of child labour during the colonial period. Due to this lack of documentation, it is hard to determine just how many children were used for what kinds of work before the nineteenth century. The first documentation of child labour in Brazil occurred during the time of indigenous societies and slave labour where it was found that children were forcibly working on tasks that exceeded their emotional and physical limits. Armando Dias, for example, died in November 1913 whilst still very young, a victim of an electric shock when entering the textile industry where he worked. Boys and girls were victims of industrial accidents on a daily basis.

In Brazil, the minimum working age has been identified as fourteen due to constitutional amendments that passed in 1934, 1937, and 1946. Yet due to a change in the dictatorship by the military in the 1980s, the minimum age restriction was reduced to twelve but was reviewed due to reports of dangerous and hazardous working conditions in 1988. This led to the minimum age being raised once again to 14. Another set of restrictions was passed in 1998 that restricted the kinds of work youth could partake in, such as work that was considered hazardous like running construction equipment, or certain kinds of factory work. Although many steps were taken to reduce the risk and occurrence of child labour, there is still a high number of children and adolescents working under the age of fourteen in Brazil. It was not until recently in the 1980s that it was discovered that almost nine million children in Brazil were working illegally and not partaking in traditional childhood activities that help to develop important life experiences.

Brazilian census data (PNAD, 1999) indicate that 2.55 million 10- to 14-year-olds were illegally holding jobs. They were joined by 3.7 million 15- to 17-year-olds and about 375,000 5- to 9-year-olds. Due to the raised age restriction of 14, at least half of the recorded young workers had been employed illegally, which led to many not being protected by important labour laws. Although substantial time has passed since the time of regulated child labour, there are still many children working illegally in Brazil. Many children are used by drug cartels to sell and carry drugs, guns, and other illegal substances because of their perception of innocence. This type of work that youth are taking part in is very dangerous due to the physical and psychological implications that come with these jobs. Yet despite the hazards that come with working with drug dealers, there has been an increase in this area of employment throughout the country.

=== Britain ===

Many factors played a role in Britain&#x27;s long-term economic growth, such as the Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s and the prominent presence of child labour during the industrial age. Children who worked at an early age were often not forced; but did so because they needed to help their family survive financially. Due to poor employment opportunities for many parents, sending their children to work on farms and in factories was a way to help feed and support the family. Child labour first started to occur in England when household businesses were turned into local labour markets that mass-produced the once homemade goods. Because children often helped produce the goods out of their homes, working in a factory to make those same goods was a simple change for many of these youths. Although there are many counts of children under the age of ten working for factories, the majority of children workers were between the ages of ten and fourteen.

Another factor that influenced child labour was the demographic changes that occurred in the eighteenth century. By the end of the eighteenth century, 20 per cent of the population was made up of children between the ages of 5 and 14. Due to this substantial shift in available workers, and the development of the industrial revolution, children began to work earlier in life in companies outside of the home. Yet, even though there was an increase of child labour in factories such as cotton textiles, there were large numbers of children working in the field of agriculture and domestic production.

With so many children working, little or no schooling increased child illiteracy. More working class parents chose not to send their children to work. Economic changes — advancing technology, raised wages, more factory regulations — reduced number of child workers.

In 1933, England and Wales adopted legislation restricting the use of children under 14 in employment. The Children and Young Persons Act 1933, defined the term &quot;child&quot; as anyone of compulsory school age (age sixteen). In general no child may be employed under the age of fifteen years, or fourteen years for light work.

=== Cambodia ===
Significant levels of child labour appear to be found in Cambodia. In 1998, ILO estimated that 24.1% of children in Cambodia aged between 10 and 14 were economically active. Many of these children work long hours and Cambodia Human Development Report 2000 reported that approximately 65,000 children between the ages of 5 and 13 worked 25 hours a week and did not attend school. There are also many initiative and policies put in place to decrease the prevalence of child labour such as the United States generalised system of preferences, the U.S.-Cambodia textile agreement, ILO Garment Sector Working Conditions Improvement Project, and ChildWise Tourism.

=== Ecuador ===

An Ecuadorean study published in 2006 found child labour to be one of the main environmental problems affecting children&#x27;s health. It reported that over 800,000 children are working in Ecuador, where they are exposed to heavy metals and toxic chemicals and are subject to mental and physical stress and the insecurity caused by being at risk of work-related accidents. Minors performing agricultural work along with their parents help apply pesticides without wearing protective equipment.

=== India ===

In 2015, the country of India is home to the largest number of children who are working illegally in various industrial industries. Agriculture in India is the largest sector where many children work at early ages to help support their family. Many of these children are forced to work at young ages due to many family factors such as unemployment, large families, poverty, and lack of parental education. This is often the major cause of the high rate of child labour in India.

On 23 June 1757, the English East India Company defeated Siraj-ud-Daula, the Nawab of Bengal, in the Battle of Plassey. The British thus became masters of east India (Bengal, Bihar, Orissa) – a prosperous region with a flourishing agriculture, industry and trade. This led to many children being forced into labour due to the increasing need of cheap labour to produce large numbers of goods. Many multinationals often employed children because that they can be recruited for less pay, and have more endurance to utilise in factory environments. Another reason many Indian children were hired was because they lack knowledge of their basic rights, they did not cause trouble or complain, and they were often more trustworthy. The innocence that comes with childhood was utilised to make a profit by many and was encouraged by the need for family income.

A variety of Indian social scientists as well as the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have done extensive research on the numeric figures of child labour found in India and determined that India contributes to one-third of Asia&#x27;s child labour and one-fourth of the world&#x27;s child labour. Due to many children being illegally employed, the Indian government began to take extensive actions to reduce the number of children working, and to focus on the importance of facilitating the proper growth and development of children. International influences help to encourage legal actions to be taken in India, such as the Geneva Declaration of the Right of Children Act was passed in 1924. This act was followed by The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 to which incorporated the basic human rights and needs of children for proper progression and growth in their younger years. These international acts encouraged major changes to the workforce in India which occurred in 1986 when the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act was put into place. This act prohibited hiring children younger than the age of 14, and from working in hazardous conditions.

Due to the increase of regulations and legal restrictions on child labour, there has been a 64 per cent decline in child labour from 1993 to 2005. Although this is a great decrease in the country of India, there is still high numbers of children working in the rural areas of India. With 85 per cent of the child labour occurring in rural areas, and 15 per cent occurring in urban areas, there are still substantial areas of concern in the country of India.

India has legislation since 1986 which allows work by children in non-hazardous industry. In 2013, the Punjab and Haryana High Court gave a landmark order that directed that there shall be a total ban on the employment of children up to the age of 14 years, be it hazardous or non-hazardous industries. However, the Court ruled that a child can work with his or her family in family based trades/occupations, for the purpose of learning a new trade/craftsmanship or vocation.

=== Iran ===

The phenomenon of children labour is one of the social issues of Iranian society, which has taken on serious and diverse dimensions over time. Researches and official and unofficial data show that this social damage is more common in big cities. Also, research data shows that most of the working children in Tehran province are related to Afghan children who have immigrated to Iran legally or illegally.

Kameel Ahmady, a social researcher and winner of the Literature and Humanities award from the World Peace Foundation, while emphasizing the fact that most of the children labour in Tehran province are Afghan children, along with his colleagues believes that with the continuation of Iran&#x27;s economic crisis, the lack of proper mechanisms to manage and control the phenomenon and absence of legal working visa scheme for Afghan immigrants have caused this social harm to spread.

Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, the Minister of Interior at the time in August 2019, while analysing and describing the situation of working children in Tehran, said: &quot;Reports show that street children live in poor conditions and are exploited.&quot; One thing that should be noted is that up to 80% of these children are non-Iranian. Considering that some of these children were Afghan nationals, we have raised the issue with the embassy of this country. If other institutions cooperate, we can take appropriate measures to organise street children, but if they do not cooperate. It has also been decided to issue arrest warrants for gangs exploiting children with the cooperation of the police force and the judicial system.

In Isfahan province, the Iranian Department of State Welfare (&quot;behzisti&quot;) keeps a database of the scanned retina irises of a number of working street kids, and have put &quot;child friendly&quot; measures in place to support them, reduce the social harm from their presence, and improve their quality of life.

Only Tehran as of June 2023 has seventy thousand working children they also collect recycles.

As of July 2023 %15 of children are child labour, 8% do not have a residence. 10 per cent of children are not in school.

===Ireland===
In post-colonial Ireland, the rate of child exploitation was extremely high as children were used as farm labourers once they were able to walk, these children were never paid for the labour that they carried out on the family farm. Children were wanted and desired in Ireland for the use of their labour on the family farm. Irish parents felt that it was the children&#x27;s duty to carry out chores on the family farm.

===Japan===
Though banned in modern Japan, &quot;shonenko&quot; (child labourers) were a feature of the Imperial era until its end in 1945. During World War II labour recruiting efforts targeted youths from Taiwan (Formosa), then a Japanese territory, with promises of educational opportunity. Though the target of 25,000 recruits was never reached, over 8,400 Taiwanese youths aged 12 to 14 relocated to Japan to help manufacture the Mitsubishi J2M Raiden aircraft.

===Pakistan===
===The Netherlands===

Child labour existed in the Netherlands up to and through the Industrial Revolution. Laws governing child labour in factories were first passed in 1874, but child labour on farms continued to be the norm up until the 20th century.

=== Soviet Union and successor states ===
Although formally banned since 1922, child labour was widespread in the Soviet Union, mostly in the form of mandatory, unpaid work by schoolchildren on Saturdays and holidays. The students were used as a cheap, unqualified workforce on &quot;kolhoz&quot; (collective farms) as well as in industry and forestry. The practice was formally called &quot;work education&quot;.

From the 1950s on, the students were also used for unpaid work at schools, where they cleaned and performed repairs. This practice has continued in the Russian Federation, where up to 21 days of the summer holidays is sometimes set aside for school works. By law, this is only allowed as part of specialised occupational training and with the students&#x27; and parents&#x27; permission, but those provisions are widely ignored. In 2012 there was an accident near the city of Nalchik where a car killed several pupils cleaning up a highway shoulder during their &quot;holiday work&quot;, as well as their teacher, who was supervising them.

Out of former Soviet Union republics Uzbekistan continued and expanded the program of child labour on industrial scale to increase profits on the main source of Islam Karimov&#x27;s income, cotton harvesting. In September, when school normally starts, the classes are suspended and children are sent to cotton fields for work, where they are assigned daily quotas of 20 to 60 kg of raw cotton they have to collect. This process is repeated in spring, when collected cotton needs to be hoed and weeded. In 2006 it is estimated that 2.7 million children were forced to work this way.

=== Switzerland ===
As in many other countries, child labour in Switzerland affected among the so-called &quot;Kaminfegerkinder&quot; (&quot;chimney sweep children&quot;) and children working p.e. in spinning mills, factories and in agriculture in 19th-century Switzerland, but also to the 1960s so-called &quot;Verdingkinder&quot; (literally: &quot;contract children&quot; or &quot;indentured child laborers&quot;) were children who were taken from their parents, often due to poverty or &quot;moral reasons&quot; – usually mothers being unmarried, very poor citizens, of Gypsy–Yeniche origin, so-called &quot;Kinder der Landstrasse&quot;, etc. – and sent to live with new families, often poor farmers who needed cheap labour.

There were even &quot;Verdingkinder&quot; auctions where children were handed over to the farmer asking the least money from the authorities, thus securing cheap labour for his farm and relieving the authority from the financial burden of looking after the children. In the 1930s 20% of all agricultural labourers in the Canton of Bern were children below the age of 15. Swiss municipality guardianship authorities acted so, commonly tolerated by federal authorities, to the 1960s, not all of them of course, but usually communities affected of low taxes in some Swiss cantons Swiss historian Marco Leuenberger investigated, that in 1930 there were some 35,000 indentured children, and between 1920 and 1970 more than 100,000 are believed to have been placed with families or homes. 10,000 &quot;Verdingkinder&quot; are still alive. Therefore, the so-called &quot;Wiedergutmachungsinitiative&quot; was started in April 2014. In April 2014 the collection of targeted at least authenticated 100,000 signatures of Swiss citizens has started, and still have to be collected to October 2015.

=== United States ===

Child labour laws in the United States are found at the federal and state levels. The most sweeping federal law that restricts the employment and abuse of child workers is the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Child labour provisions under FLSA are designed to protect the educational opportunities of youth and prohibit their employment in jobs that are detrimental to their health and safety. FLSA restricts the hours that youth under 16 years of age can work and lists hazardous occupations too dangerous for young workers to perform.

Under the FLSA, for non-agricultural jobs, children under 14 may not be employed, children between 14 and 16 may be employed in allowed occupations during limited hours, and children between 16 and 17 may be employed for unlimited hours in non-hazardous occupations. A number of exceptions to these rules exist, such as for employment by parents, newspaper delivery, and child actors. The regulations for agricultural employment are generally less strict.

States have varying laws covering youth employment. Each state has minimum requirements such as, earliest age a child may begin working, number of hours a child is allowed to be working during the day, number of hours a child is allowed to be worked during the week. The United States Department of Labor lists the minimum requirements for agricultural work in each state. Where state law differs from federal law on child labour, the law with the more rigorous standard applies.

Individual states have a wide range of restrictions on labour by minors, often requiring work permits for minors who are still enrolled in high school, limiting the times and hours that minors can work by age and imposing additional safety regulations.

==Laws and initiatives==

Almost every country in the world has laws relating to and aimed at preventing child labour. International Labour Organization has helped set international law, which most countries have signed on and ratified. According to ILO minimum age convention (C138) of 1973, child labour refers to any work performed by children under the age of 12, non-light work done by children aged 12–14, and hazardous work done by children aged 15–17. Light work was defined, under this convention, as any work that does not harm a child&#x27;s health and development, and that does not interfere with his or her attendance at school. This convention has been ratified by 171 countries.

The United Nations adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990, which was subsequently ratified by 193 countries. Article 32 of the convention addressed child labour, as follows:...Parties recognise the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child&#x27;s education, or to be harmful to the child&#x27;s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.

Under Article 1 of the 1990 Convention, a child is defined as &quot;every human being below the age of eighteen years unless, under the law applicable to the child, a majority is attained earlier.&quot; Article 28 of this Convention requires States to, &quot;make primary education compulsory and available free to all.&quot;

As of 2024, 196 countries are party to the convention; the only nation that has not ratified the treaty is the United States.

In 1999, ILO helped lead the Worst Forms Convention 182 (C182), which has so far been signed upon and domestically ratified by 151 countries including the United States. This international law prohibits worst forms of child labour, defined as all forms of slavery and slavery-like practices, such as child trafficking, debt bondage, and forced labour, including forced recruitment of children into armed conflict. The law also prohibits the use of a child for prostitution or the production of pornography, child labour in illicit activities such as drug production and trafficking; and in hazardous work. Both the Worst Forms Convention (C182) and the Minimum Age Convention (C138) are examples of international labour standards implemented through the ILO that deal with child labour.

In addition to setting the international law, the United Nations initiated International Program on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) in 1992. This initiative aims to progressively eliminate child labour through strengthening national capacities to address some of the causes of child labour. Amongst the key initiative is the so-called time-bounded programme countries, where child labour is most prevalent and schooling opportunities lacking. The initiative seeks to achieve amongst other things, universal primary school availability. The IPEC has expanded to at least the following target countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, El Salvador, Nepal, Tanzania, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Philippines, Senegal, South Africa and Turkey.

Targeted child labour campaigns were initiated by the International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) in order to advocate for prevention and elimination of all forms of child labour. The global Music against Child Labour Initiative was launched in 2013 in order to involve socially excluded children in structured musical activity and education in efforts to help protect them from child labour.

===Exceptions granted===
In 2004, the United States passed an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The amendment allows certain children aged 14–18 to work in or outside a business where machinery is used to process wood. The law aims to respect the religious and cultural needs of the Amish community of the United States. The Amish believe that one effective way to educate children is on the job. The new law allows Amish children the ability to work with their families, once they are past eighth grade in school.

Similarly, in 1996, member countries of the European Union, per Directive 94/33/EC, agreed to a number of exceptions for young people in its child labour laws. Under these rules, children of various ages may work in cultural, artistic, sporting or advertising activities if authorised by the competent authority. Children above the age of 13 may perform light work for a limited number of hours per week in other economic activities as defined at the discretion of each country. Additionally, the European law exception allows children aged 14 years or over to work as part of a work/training scheme. The EU Directive clarified that these exceptions do not allow child labour where the children may experience harmful exposure to dangerous substances. Nonetheless, many children under the age of 13 do work, even in the most developed countries of the EU. For instance, a recent study showed over a third of Dutch twelve-year-old kids had a job, the most common being babysitting.

===More laws vs. more freedom===

Scholars disagree on the best legal course forward to address child labour. Some suggest the need for laws that place a blanket ban on any work by children less than 18 years old. Others suggest the current international laws are enough, and the need for more engaging approach to achieve the ultimate goals.

Some scholars suggest any labour by children aged 18 years or less is wrong since this encourages illiteracy, inhumane work and lower investment in human capital. These activists claim that child labour also leads to poor labour standards for adults, depresses the wages of adults in developing countries as well as the developed countries, and dooms the third world economies to low-skill jobs only capable of producing poor quality cheap exports. More children that work in poor countries, the fewer and worse-paid are the jobs for adults in these countries. In other words, there are moral and economic reasons that justify a blanket ban on labour from children aged 18 years or less, everywhere in the world.

Other scholars suggest that these arguments are flawed and ignore history, and that more laws will do more harm than good. According to them, child labour is merely the symptom of poverty. If laws ban all lawful work that enables the poor to survive, informal economy, illicit operations and underground businesses will thrive. These will increase abuse of the children. In poor countries with very high incidence rates of child labour – such as Ethiopia, Chad, Niger and Nepal – schools are not available, and the few schools that exist offer poor quality education or are unaffordable. The alternatives for children who currently work, claim these studies, are worse: grinding subsistence farming, militia or prostitution. Child labour is not a choice, it is a necessity, the only option for survival. It is currently the least undesirable of a set of very bad choices. Traidcraft Exchange and Homeworkers Worldwide argue that attempts to eliminate child labour without addressing the level of adult earnings may lead to children being engaged in labour in &quot;less visible and more hazardous occupations&quot;.
These scholars suggest, from their studies of economic and social data, that early 20th-century child labour in Europe and the United States ended in large part as a result of the economic development of the formal regulated economy, technology development and general prosperity. Child labour laws and ILO conventions came later. Edmonds suggests, even in contemporary times, the incidence of child labour in Vietnam has rapidly reduced following economic reforms and GDP growth. These scholars suggest economic engagement, emphasis on opening quality schools rather than more laws and expanding economically relevant skill development opportunities in the third world. International legal actions, such as trade sanctions increase child labour.

&quot;The Incredible Bread Machine&quot;, a book published by &quot;World Research, Inc.&quot; in 1974, stated:

==Incidents==
===Cocoa production===

In 1998, UNICEF reported that Ivory Coast farmers used enslaved children – many from surrounding countries. In late 2000 a BBC documentary reported the use of enslaved children in the production of cocoa – the main ingredient in chocolate – in West Africa. Other media followed by reporting widespread child slavery and child trafficking in the production of cocoa. In 2001, the US State Department estimated there were 15,000 child slaves cocoa, cotton and coffee farms in the Ivory Coast, and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association acknowledged that child slavery is used in the cocoa harvest.

Malian migrants have long worked on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast, but in 2000 cocoa prices had dropped to a 10-year low and some farmers stopped paying their employees. The Malian counsel had to rescue some boys who had not been paid for five years and who were beaten if they tried to run away. Malian officials believed that 15,000 children, some as young as 11 years old, were working in the Ivory Coast in 2001. These children were often from poor families or the slums and were sold to work in other countries. Parents were told the children would find work and send money home, but once the children left home, they often worked in conditions resembling slavery. In other cases, children begging for food were lured from bus stations and sold as slaves. In 2002, the Ivory Coast had 12,000 children with no relatives nearby, which suggested they were trafficked, likely from neighboring Mali, Burkina Faso and Togo.

The cocoa industry was accused of profiting from child slavery and trafficking. The European Cocoa Association dismissed these accusations as &quot;false and excessive&quot; and the industry said the reports were not representative of all areas. Later the industry acknowledged the working conditions for children were unsatisfactory and children&#x27;s rights were sometimes violated and acknowledged the claims could not be ignored. In a BBC interview, the ambassador for Ivory Coast to the United Kingdom called these reports of widespread use of slave child labour by 700,000 cocoa farmers as absurd and inaccurate.

In 2001, a voluntary agreement called the Harkin–Engel Protocol, was accepted by the international cocoa and chocolate industry to eliminate the worst forms of child labour, as defined by ILO&#x27;s Convention 182, in West Africa. This agreement created a foundation named International Cocoa Initiative in 2002. The foundation claims it has, as of 2011, active programs in 290 cocoa growing communities in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Ghana, reaching a total population of 689,000 people to help eliminate the worst forms of child labour in cocoa industry. Other organisations claim progress has been made, but the protocol&#x27;s 2005 deadlines have not yet been met.

===Mining in Africa===
In 2008, Bloomberg claimed child labour in copper and cobalt mines that supplied Chinese companies in Congo. The children are &quot;creuseurs&quot;, that is they dig the ore by hand, carry sacks of ores on their backs, and these are then purchased by these companies. Over 60 of Katanga&#x27;s 75 processing plants are owned by Chinese companies and 90 per cent of the region&#x27;s minerals go to China. An African NGO report claimed 80,000 child labourers under the age of 15, or about 40% of all miners, were supplying ore to Chinese companies in this African region.
Amnesty International alleged in 2016 that some cobalt sold by Congo Dongfang Mining was produced by child labour, and that it was being used in lithium-ion batteries powering electric cars and mobile devices worldwide.

BBC, in 2012, accused Glencore of using child labour in its mining and smelting operations of Africa. Glencore denied it used child labour, and said it has strict policy of not using child labour. The company claimed it has a strict policy whereby all copper was mined correctly, placed in bags with numbered seals and then sent to the smelter. Glencore mentioned being aware of child miners who were part of a group of artisanal miners who had without authorisation raided the concession awarded to the company since 2010; Glencore has been pleading with the government to remove the artisanal miners from the concession.

Small-scale artisanal mining of gold is another source of dangerous child labour in poor rural areas in certain parts of the world. This form of mining uses labour-intensive and low-tech methods. It is informal sector of the economy. Human Rights Watch group estimates that about 12 per cent of global gold production comes from artisanal mines. In west Africa, in countries such as Mali – the third largest exporter of gold in Africa – between 20,000 and 40,000 children work in artisanal mining. Locally known as &quot;orpaillage&quot;, children as young as six years old work with their families. These children and families suffer chronic exposure to toxic chemicals including mercury, and do hazardous work such as digging shafts and working underground, pulling up, carrying and crushing the ore. The poor work practices harm the long-term health of children, as well as release hundreds of tons of mercury every year into local rivers, ground water and lakes. Gold is important to the economy of Mali and Ghana. For Mali, it is the second largest earner of its export revenue. For many poor families with children, it is the primary and sometimes the only source of income.

===Meatpacking===

In early August 2008, Iowa Labour Commissioner David Neil announced that his department had found that Agriprocessors, a kosher meatpacking company in Postville which had recently been raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, had employed 57 minors, some as young as 14, in violation of state law prohibiting anyone under 18 from working in a meatpacking plant. Neil announced that he was turning the case over to the state Attorney General for prosecution, claiming that his department&#x27;s inquiry had discovered &quot;egregious violations of virtually every aspect of Iowa&#x27;s child labour laws.&quot; Agriprocessors claimed that it was at a loss to understand the allegations. Agriprocessors&#x27; CEO went to trial on these charges in state court on 4 May 2010. After a five-week trial he was found not guilty of all 57 charges of child labour violations by the Black Hawk County District Court jury in Waterloo, Iowa, on 7 June 2010.

===GAP===

A 2007 report claimed some GAP products had been produced by child labourers. GAP acknowledged the problem and announced it is pulling the products from its shelves. The report found that GAP had rigorous social audit systems since 2004 to eliminate child labour in its supply chain. However, the report concluded that the system was being abused by unscrupulous subcontractors.

GAP&#x27;s policy, the report claimed, is that if it discovers child labour was used by its supplier in its branded clothes, the contractor must remove the child from the workplace, provide them with access to schooling and a wage, and guarantee the opportunity of work on reaching a legal working age.

In 2007, The New York Times reported that GAP, after the child labour discovery, created a $200,000 grant to improve working conditions in the supplier community. GAP created strong relationships with developing countries to help prevent child labour and find solutions; GAP would conduct interviews and reach out to their 100,000 employees worldwide to get insight into how they feel about GAP&#x27;s work environments. This survey concluded with a 68 per cent response rate, and 77 per cent of respondents considered GAP a great environment to work in.

===H&amp;M and Zara===
In December 2009, campaigners in the UK called on two leading high street retailers to stop selling clothes made with cotton which may have been picked by children. Anti-Slavery International and the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) accused H&amp;M and Zara of using cotton suppliers in Bangladesh. It is also suspected that many of their raw materials originates from Uzbekistan, where children aged 10 are forced to work in the fields. The activists were calling to ban the use of Uzbek cotton and implement a &quot;track and trace&quot; systems to guarantee an ethical responsible source of the material.

H&amp;M said it &quot;does not accept&quot; child labour and &quot;seeks to avoid&quot; using Uzbek cotton, but admitted it did &quot;not have any reliable methods&quot; to ensure Uzbek cotton did not end up in any of its products. Inditex, the owner of Zara, said its code of conduct banned child labour.

===Silk weaving===
A 2003 Human Rights Watch report claimed children as young as five years old were employed and worked for up to 12 hours a day and six to seven days a week in the silk industry. These children, HRW claimed, were bonded child labour in India, easy to find in Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.

In 2010, a German news investigative report claimed that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) had found up to 10,000 children working in the 1,000 silk factories in 1998. In other locations, thousands of bonded child labourers were present in 1994. After UNICEF and NGOs got involved, the child labour figure dropped drastically after 2005, with the total estimated to be fewer than a thousand child labourers. The report claims the released children were back in school.

===Primark===
In 2008, the BBC reported that the company Primark was using child labour in the manufacture of clothing. In particular, a £4 hand-embroidered shirt was the starting point of a documentary produced by BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; programme. The programme asks consumers to ask themselves, &quot;Why am I only paying £4 for a hand embroidered top? This item looks handmade. Who made it for such little cost?&quot;, in addition to exposing the violent side of the child labour industry in countries where child exploitation is prevalent.

As a result of the BBC report, Royal Television Society awarded it a prize, and Primark took immediate action and fired three Indian suppliers in 2008.

Primark continued to investigate the allegations for three years, concluding that BBC report was a fake. In 2011, following an investigation by the BBC Trust&#x27;s Editorial Standards Committee, the BBC announced, &quot;Having carefully scrutinised all of the relevant evidence, the committee concluded that, on the balance of probabilities, it was more likely than not that the Bangalore footage was not authentic.&quot; BBC subsequently apologised for faking footage, and returned the television award for investigative reporting.

==Elimination==

Concerns have often been raised over the buying public&#x27;s moral complicity in purchasing products assembled or otherwise manufactured in developing countries with child labour. However, others have raised concerns that boycotting products manufactured through child labour may force these children to turn to more dangerous or strenuous professions, such as prostitution or agriculture. For example, a UNICEF study found that after the Child Labor Deterrence Act was introduced in the US, an estimated 50,000 children were dismissed from their garment industry jobs in Bangladesh, leaving many to resort to jobs such as &quot;stone-crushing, street hustling, and prostitution&quot;, jobs that are &quot;more hazardous and exploitative than garment production&quot;. The study suggests that boycotts are &quot;blunt instruments with long-term consequences, that can actually harm rather than help the children involved.&quot;

According to Milton Friedman, before the Industrial Revolution virtually all children worked in agriculture. During the Industrial Revolution many of these children moved from farm work to factory work. Over time, as real wages rose, parents became able to afford to send their children to school instead of work and as a result child labour declined, both before and after legislation.

British historian and socialist E. P. Thompson in &quot;The Making of the English Working Class&quot; draws a qualitative distinction between child domestic work and participation in the wider (waged) labour market. Further, the usefulness of the experience of the industrial revolution in making predictions about current trends has been disputed. Social historian Hugh Cunningham, author of &quot;Children and Childhood in Western Society Since 1500&quot;, notes that:

According to Thomas DeGregori, an economics professor at the University of Houston, in an article published by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank operating in Washington D.C., &quot;it is clear that technological and economic change are vital ingredients in getting children out of the workplace and into schools. Then they can grow to become productive adults and live longer, healthier lives. However, in poor countries like Bangladesh, working children are essential for survival in many families, as they were in our own heritage until the late 19th century. So, while the struggle to end child labour is necessary, getting there often requires taking different routes—and, sadly, there are many political obstacles.

The International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC), founded in 1992, aims to eliminate child labour. It operates in 88 countries and is the largest program of its kind in the world. IPEC works with international and government agencies, NGOs, the media, and children and their families to end child labour and provide children with education and assistance.

From 2008 to 2013, the ILO operated a program through IPEC entitled &quot;Combating Abusive Child Labour (CACL-II)&quot;. The project, funded by the European Union, contributed to the Government of Pakistan by providing alternative opportunities for vocational training and education to children withdrawn from the worst forms of child labour.

Periodically, governments, employers&#x27; and workers&#x27; organisations have met in global conference to assess progress and remaining obstacles and to agree measures to eliminate the worst forms of child labour by 2016: first in Oslo (1997), followed by: The Hague (2010); Brasília, 8–10 October 2013; Buenos Aires, 14–16 November 2017; and most recently Durban, South Africa, 15–20 May 2022.

Between 2000 and 2012, progress was made against child labour but the elimination of its worst forms was not accomplished.
Under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda, UN Member States, employers&#x27; and workers&#x27; organisations, and civil society organisations are required to work together to eliminate child labour by 2025, forced labour, modern slavery and human trafficking by 2030. Thus, the ILO established Alliance 8.7 as a global partnership.

In January 2021, the ILO published the Child Labour Global Estimates 2020 in collaboration with UNICEF. According to the report child labour decreased by 38% from 246 million in 2000 to 152 million in 2016. Due to COVID-19 pandemic the number of children in child labour increased by 9 million.

==Statistics==

==Potential positives==

The term &quot;child labour&quot; can be misleading when it confuses harmful work with employment that may be beneficial to children. It can also ignore harmful work outside employment and any benefits children normally derive from their work. Domestic work is an example: all families but the rich must work at cleaning, cooking, caring, and more to maintain their homes. In most families in the world, this process extends to productive activities, especially herding and various types of agriculture, and to a variety of small family businesses. Where trading is a significant feature of social life, children can start trading in small items at an early age, often in the company of family members or of peers.

Work is undertaken from an early age by vast numbers of children in the world and may have a natural place in growing up.
Work can contribute to the well-being of children in a variety of ways; children often choose to work to improve their lives, both in the short- and long-term. At the material level, children&#x27;s work often contributes to producing food or earning income that benefits themselves and their families; and such income is especially important when the families are poor. Work can provide an escape from debilitating poverty, sometimes by allowing a young person to move away from an impoverished environment. Young people often enjoy their work, especially paid work, or when work involves the company of peers. Even when work is intensive and enforced, children often find ways to combine their work with play.

While full-time work hinders schooling, empirical evidence is varied on the relationship between part-time work and school. Sometimes even part-time work may hinder school attendance or performance. On the other hand, many poor children work for resources to attend school. Children who are not doing well at school sometimes seek more satisfactory experience in work. Good relations with a supervisor at work can provide relief from tensions that children feel at school and home. In the modern world, school education has become so central to society that schoolwork has become the dominant work for most children, often replacing participation in productive work. If school curricula or quality do not provide children with appropriate skills for available jobs or if children do not have the aptitude for schoolwork, school may impede the learning of skills, such as agriculture, which will become necessary for future livelihood.

<text>The Goodbye Girl is a 1977 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Herbert Ross, written by Neil Simon and starring Richard Dreyfuss, Marsha Mason, Quinn Cummings and Paul Benedict. The film, produced by Ray Stark, centers on an odd trio of characters: a struggling actor who has sublet a Manhattan apartment from a friend, the current occupant (his friend&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, who has just been abandoned), and her precocious young daughter.

Richard Dreyfuss won the 1977 Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Elliot Garfield. At the time, he became the youngest man (at age 30) to win an Oscar for Best Actor. Both Mason and Cummings were nominated for Oscars.

The film became the first romantic comedy to earn $100 million in box-office grosses.

==Plot==
Dancer and divorcee Paula McFadden and her ten-year-old daughter Lucy live in a Manhattan apartment with her married boyfriend, Tony DeForrest. Coming home from shopping, Paula finds Tony gone as he had deserted her to travel to Italy for a film role. Prior to his departure (and unbeknownst to Paula), Tony sublet the apartment to Elliot Garfield, a neurotic but sweet aspiring actor from Chicago, who shows up in the middle of the night expecting to move in. Paula, who is demanding, cynical, and neurotic, makes it clear that she does not like Elliot but reluctantly lets him move in.

Paula is struggling to get back into shape so she can resume her career as a dancer. Meanwhile, Elliot has landed the title role in an off-off-Broadway production of &quot;Richard III&quot;, but the director, Mark, wants him to play Richard III of England as an exaggerated homosexual stereotype. Reluctantly, Elliot agrees to the non-traditional portrayal, despite knowing that it may mean the end of his acting career. Theater critics savage the show, paying special attention to trashing Elliot&#x27;s performance. Elliot gets drunk because of the critic&#x27;s review. The play quickly closes, much to his relief.

Despite their frequent clashes and Paula&#x27;s lack of gratitude for Elliot&#x27;s help, the two fall in love and sleep together. Lucy grows cautious and sees the affair as a repeat of what happened with Tony. Elliot convinces Paula that he will not be a repeat; later he picks up Lucy from school and takes her on a carriage ride, during which she admits she likes him. In response, Elliot explains how much he cares for Lucy and Paula and that he would not do anything to hurt them.

Elliot lands a job at an improvisational theatre and is seen by a well-known film director. He is offered a film role, but the job is in Seattle and he will be gone for four weeks. Paula is scared that Elliot is leaving her, never to return, like all the other men in her life. Later, he calls Paula from the phone booth across the street and invites her to go with him while he is filming. Paula declines but is encouraged by the invitation. Before hanging up, Elliot asks Paula to restring his prized guitar, and she realizes that this proves he really does love her and will return.

* Quinn Cummings as Lucy McFadden
* Paul Benedict as Mark Bodine

==Production==
The film began as a screenplay called &quot;Bogart Slept Here&quot; (essentially the story of what happened to Dustin Hoffman after he became a star) that was to star Robert De Niro and Mason for Warner Bros. It would have been the film De Niro made immediately after &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;. Mike Nichols was hired to direct.

Simon recalled the original idea for the film:

The basic idea of the story was that Marsha, an ex-dancer, was married to a very promising but struggling off-Broadway actor who gets discovered in a small play and is whisked out to Hollywood, where he reluctantly moves with his family. He feels very out of place there...and they have trouble adjusting, especially after his first film makes him an international star...and it creates chaos in their marriage. The story was coming out a little darker than I had imagined, but I envisioned the character of the wife as a very good role for Marsha.

Filming began on &quot;Bogart Slept Here&quot; but it became apparent that De Niro was not right for the role. Simon recalled: &quot;...it was clear that any of the humor I had written was going to get lost. It&#x27;s not that De Niro is not funny, but his humor comes mostly from his nuances, a bemused expression on his face or the way he would look at a character, smile and then look up at the ceiling.&quot; Nichols insisted on recasting De Niro. As De Niro recalled “I didn’t know certain types of things, it was a certain type of comedy –Neil Simon- the timing had to be a certain way, I didn’t feel enthused by it ... It wasn’t working. I shot for about two weeks. I had about three times in my life where I had that experience with a director, where we can’t make them happy — so this was one of them. I was sitting in my camper, you feel this dread. I was going to offer my salary to keep us going for another week of rehearsals. (Nichols) said &#x27;I think we’re going to have to end it.&#x27; He felt terrible. He was really upset.” Soon after, Nichols left the project.

Dreyfuss was brought in to audition with Mason. At the end of the reading, Simon decided the chemistry was there, but the script needed work. He rewrote the screenplay in six weeks.

[The screenplay] had to be funnier, more romantic, the way Marsha and I first imagined the picture would be. What I wanted to do was a prequel. In other words, instead of an off-Broadway actor, married with a child, why don&#x27;t I start from the beginning? I&#x27;d start when they first meet. Not liking each other at first and then falling in love.

The film&#x27;s exteriors were filmed in New York City and the interiors were shot on sets in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. was less than enthused about Simon&#x27;s script and considered selling the project to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but the studio ultimately decided to partner with MGM on the film instead. With the 1996 acquisition of Turner Entertainment Company, which owned the pre-May 1986 MGM film library by Time Warner, Warner Bros. now owns the rights and distribution of the film.

==Soundtrack==
The title song, &quot;Goodbye Girl&quot;, was written and performed by David Gates in 1977, and was a top 20 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1977/78, peaking at #15.

==Reception==
Roger Ebert gave the film a mostly favorable review, awarding three stars out of four. He was unimpressed with Mason&#x27;s performance and the character as written, calling it &quot;hardly ever sympathetic.&quot; However, he praised Dreyfuss and cited his &quot;Richard III&quot; scenes as &quot;the funniest in a movie since Mel Brooks staged &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot;.&quot; Ebert criticized the beginning as &quot;awkward at times and never quite involving,&quot; but &quot;enjoyed its conclusion so much that we almost forgot our earlier reservations.&quot; Gene Siskel awarded an identical three-star grade and said, &quot;Make no mistake about it, the very best thing about &#x27;The Goodbye Girl&#x27; is the character of Elliot Garfield as played by Dreyfuss, a character that comes very close to Dreyfuss&#x27; own self-and-profession centered lifestyle. But like Dreyfuss himself, Elliott Garfield, who initially comes off as [a] pushy, prickly type, ultimately wins you over.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found the film to be &quot;exhausting without being much fun&quot; and &quot;relentlessly wisecracked.&quot; Charles Champlin of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; lauded it as &quot;the best and most blissfully satisfying romantic comedy of the year and then some.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;another feather in Herbert Ross&#x27; directorial cap,&quot; with Dreyfuss giving &quot;his best screen performance to date.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film &quot;evolves into the most satisfying comedy Simon has written directly for the movies. One tolerates the plot mechanics for the sake of the genuinely amusing aspects of his script, the bright remarks and the distinctive or appealing character traits that provide good performers with live ammunition.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was negative, commenting, &quot;It&#x27;s not Neil Simon&#x27;s one-liners that get you down in &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot;, it&#x27;s his two-liners. The snappiness of the exchanges is so forced it&#x27;s almost macabre.&quot; David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s pure formula, and Simon plays it straight, all cards on the table, with the conservative professionalism of a gambler used to winning. As directed by the ubiquitous Herbert Ross, &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; is a modest, bittersweet comedy that will delight Simon fans and leave his critics staunchly unconverted.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
Richard Dreyfuss was 30 when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, making him the youngest actor ever to win the category. This record stood for 25 years until 2002 when Adrien Brody—just one month shy of his 30th birthday—won for &quot;The Pianist&quot;.

==Musical and remake==
There were three failed attempts to turn &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; into a half-hour, television sitcom, according to Lee Goldberg&#x27;s book &quot;Unsold Television Pilots.&quot; The first pilot, aired on NBC in May 1982 and titled &quot;Goodbye Doesn&#x27;t Mean Forever&quot;, starred Karen Valentine and Michael Lembeck, and was directed by James Burrows from a script by Allan Katz. The second, unaired pilot was produced a year later starring JoBeth Williams and was directed by Charlotte Brown from a script by Brown and Pat Nardo. The third pilot, which never aired, again starred Valentine and was directed by Jay Sandrich.

&quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; was developed into a 1993 Broadway musical of the same name starring Martin Short and Bernadette Peters.

A 2004 remake with Jeff Daniels and Patricia Heaton keeps the screenplay from the original version.

==Home media==
The VHS format has been released several times over the years. MGM/UA Home Video released the 1993 and 1996 versions, while Warner Home Video released the 2000 version in addition to releasing the DVD version. A manufacture-on-demand Blu-ray format was released through Warner Archive Collection on November 8, 2016. The film is available also via streaming through various services.

== In popular culture ==
Footage from the film appears in the episode &quot;Kin&quot; on &quot;The Last of Us&quot;.

<text>The English Patient is a 1996 epic romantic war drama film directed by Anthony Minghella from his own script based on the 1992 novel by Michael Ondaatje, and produced by Saul Zaentz. The film stars Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas alongside Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe and Colin Firth in supporting roles.

The eponymous protagonist, a man burned beyond recognition who speaks with an English accent, recalls his history in a series of flashbacks, revealing to the audience his true identity and the love affair in which he was involved before the war. The film ends with a definitive onscreen statement that it is a highly fictionalized account of László Almásy (died 1951) and other historical figures and events. The film received widespread critical acclaim and emerged as a major commercial success at the box-office.

The film received twelve nominations at the 69th Academy Awards, winning nine, including Best Picture, Best Director for Minghella, and Best Supporting Actress for Binoche. It was also the first to receive a Best Editing Oscar for a digitally edited film. Ralph Fiennes, playing the titular character, and Kristin Scott Thomas were Oscar-nominated for their performances. The film also won five BAFTA Awards and two Golden Globes. The British Film Institute ranked &quot;The English Patient&quot; the 55th-greatest British film of the 20th century. The American Film Institute ranked it the 56th-greatest love story of all time.

As of August 2021, another adaptation of the novel was in early development for a new BBC television series, co-produced by Miramax Television and Paramount Television Studios.

==Plot==
A British biplane, flying across the desert, is shot down by German gunners. The badly burned pilot is pulled from the wreckage and rescued by a group of Bedouin.

Hana, a French-Canadian WWII Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps combat nurse, discovers from a wounded soldier that her boyfriend has been killed. In October 1944 Italy, she is caring for a dying, severely burned English-accented patient who says he cannot remember his name. His only possession is a copy of Herodotus&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot;, with personal notes, pictures, and mementos stored inside.

When a nurse friend is killed in front of her, Hana decides she is a curse to her loved ones. She gains permission to settle in a bombed-out monastery with her patient, as he is suffering during their hospital unit&#x27;s relocation.

Lieutenant Kip, a Sikh sapper in the British Indian Army posted with Sergeant Hardy to clear German mines and booby traps, soon joins them. David Caravaggio, a Canadian Intelligence Corps operative who was tortured during a German interrogation, also arrives there. He questions the patient, who gradually reveals his past through a series of flashbacks. Over the days of the patient relating his story, Hana and Kip begin a shy love affair.

In the late 1930s, Hungarian cartographer László Almásy is exploring a region of the Sahara as part of a Royal Geographical Society archeological and surveying expedition group, which includes his good friend Englishman Peter Madox, and British couple Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who provide aerial surveys using their plane.

Almásy discovers through a Bedouin the location of the ancient Cave of Swimmers, containing cave paintings. As the group documents their findings, Almásy and Katharine fall in love. He writes about her in notes folded into his book, which she discovers when he awkwardly accepts two watercolours of the cave walls and asks her to paste them into the book.

Upon returning to Cairo, they begin an affair, while the group arranges for more detailed archaeological surveys of the cave and the surrounding area. Almásy buys her a silver thimble as a gift. Geoffrey secretly watches her from his car and realizes that she is cheating. Some months later, Katharine abruptly breaks things off, fearing the repercussions from Geoffrey. Shortly afterward the archaeological projects are halted due to the onset of the war. Madox leaves his Tiger Moth airplane at Kufra Oasis before his return to Britain.

Caravaggio now seeks revenge for his injuries, so far killing the German interrogator who cut off his thumbs and the spy who identified him, but now seeks whoever provided maps to the Germans, allowing them to infiltrate Cairo. He suspects Almásy, asking &quot;Did you kill the Cliftons?&quot;, to which Almásy concedes &quot;Maybe... I did&quot;.

Almásy tells Caravaggio, with Hana listening nearby, about packing camp in 1941 when Geoffrey arrives in the biplane. He aims at Almásy, who jumps out of the way, and crashes. Almásy finds Geoffrey dead at the controls and Katharine badly injured in the front seat. It was an attempted double murder-suicide, as he uncovered their affair. Almásy carries Katharine to the Cave of Swimmers. Seeing her wearing the thimble on a chain, she declares she has always loved him.

Leaving her there with provisions and his book, Almásy walks three days cross-desert. Arriving at British-held El Tag, he explains her desperate situation and asks for help, but a young officer detains him on suspicion of being a spy.

Transported away by train, Almásy escapes and eventually comes across a German army unit. They take him to the Kufra Oasis, where Madox has hidden his plane. Exchanging maps for fuel, Almásy flies to the cave, where he finds Katharine dead. Taking her on the plane, they are burned when shot down, connecting to the opening scene. After hearing the story, Caravaggio gives up his quest for revenge.

Kip is reposted once he has cleared the explosives; he and Hana agree they will meet again. Later, Almásy tells her he has had enough by pushing many vials of morphine towards her. Though distraught, Hana grants his wish, administering the lethal dose. As he drifts to sleep, she reads him Katharine&#x27;s final letter, written while alone in the cave. The next morning Hana goes with Caravaggio to Florence, holding Almásy&#x27;s book tightly as they ride away.

==Cast==

In addition, Torri Higginson plays Mary and Liisa Repo-Martell plays Jan, appearing briefly as Hana&#x27;s nursing corps colleagues.

==Production==
Saul Zaentz was interested in working with Anthony Minghella after he saw the director&#x27;s film &quot;Truly, Madly, Deeply&quot; (1990); Minghella brought this project to the producer&#x27;s attention. Michael Ondaatje, the Sri Lankan-born Canadian author of the novel, worked closely with the filmmakers. According to Minghella, during the development of the project with 20th Century Fox, the &quot;studio wanted the insurance policy of so-called bigger&quot; actors. Zaentz recalled, &quot;they&#x27;d look at you and say, &#x27;Could we cast Demi Moore in the role&#x27;?&quot; After months of disputes with Fox, the studio pulled out just three weeks before production was to begin and Harvey Weinstein came in and acquired worldwide rights for Miramax Films for $27.5 million. After Miramax became involved, the director&#x27;s preference for Scott Thomas in the role of Katharine was honored. To help the film get made, cast and crew agreed to salary deferrals totalling $10 million and Zaentz met the remainder of the production costs. Including the deferred costs, &quot;Variety&quot; reported the production costs at $43 million. The deferments were due to be paid after the film broke even, however, although the actors received a deferred payment of $5 million, after over three years after release, others were still waiting for their deferred salaries, subject to an audit of the figures. Zaentz sued Miramax Films in 2006 claiming $20 million but the case was still unresolved when Zaentz died in 2014.

The film was shot on location in Tunisia and Italy.

&quot;The Conversations: Walter Murch and the Art of Editing Film&quot; by Michael Ondaatje is based on the conversations between the author and film editor. Murch, with a career that already included such complex works as the Godfather trilogy, &quot;The Conversation,&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Now,&quot; dreaded the task of editing the film with multiple flashbacks and time frames. Once he began, the possibilities became apparent, some of which took him away from the order of the original script. A reel without sound was made so scene change visuals would be consistent with the quality of the aural aspect between the two. The final cut features over 40 temporal transitions. It was during this time that Murch met Ondaatje and they were able to exchange thoughts about editing the film.

In the film, two types of aircraft were used: a De Havilland D.H.82 Tiger Moth and a Boeing-Stearman Model 75. Both are biplanes. The camp crash scene was made with a -size scale model.

The Hungarian folk song, &quot;Szerelem, Szerelem&quot;, performed by Muzsikas featuring Márta Sebestyén, was featured in the film.

==Reception==
&quot;The English Patient&quot; received widespread critical acclaim, and emerged as a major commercial success at the box-office, and received nine Academy Awards, six BAFTA awards, and two Golden Globe Awards.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the movie &quot;a stunning feat of literary adaptation as well as a purely cinematic triumph&quot;. In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Anthony Lane argues that &quot;the triumph of the film lies not just in the force and the range of the performances—the crisp sweetness of Scott Thomas, say, versus the raw volatility of Binoche—but in Minghella&#x27;s creation of an intimate epic: vast landscapes mingle with the minute details of desire, and the combination is transfixing&quot;.

The film has a rating of 86% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 91 reviews, with an average of 7.90/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Though it suffers from excessive length and ambition, director Minghella&#x27;s adaptation of the Michael Ondaatje novel is complex, powerful, and moving.&quot; The film also has a rating of 87/100 on Metacritic, based on 31 critical reviews. &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert gave the film a four-star rating, saying &quot;it&#x27;s the kind of movie you can see twice – first for the questions, the second time for the answers&quot;. In his movie guide, Leonard Maltin rated the film out of 4, calling it &quot;a mesmerizing adaptation&quot; of Ondaatje&#x27;s novel, saying &quot;Fiennes and Scott Thomas are perfectly matched&quot;, and he concluded by calling the film &quot;an exceptional achievement all around&quot;. In 2021, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called the movie a &quot;masterpiece&quot; in a 25-year anniversary review.

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;A−&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

It became the highest-grossing film in the history of Miramax with a worldwide gross of $232 million.

The film is referred to in the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The English Patient&quot;, where the character Elaine is shunned by her friends and co-workers for disliking the film.

<text>Orthostatic hypotension, also known as postural hypotension, is a medical condition wherein a person&#x27;s blood pressure drops when they are standing up (orthostasis) or sitting down. Primary orthostatic hypotension is also often referred to as neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. The drop in blood pressure may be sudden (vasovagal orthostatic hypotension), within 3 minutes (classic orthostatic hypotension) or gradual (delayed orthostatic hypotension). It is defined as a fall in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg after 3 minutes of standing. It occurs predominantly by delayed (or absent) constriction of the lower body blood vessels, which is normally required to maintain adequate blood pressure when changing the position to standing. As a result, blood pools in the blood vessels of the legs for a longer period, and less is returned to the heart, thereby leading to a reduced cardiac output and inadequate blood flow to the brain.

Very mild occasional orthostatic hypotension is common and can occur briefly in anyone, although it is prevalent in particular among the elderly and those with known low blood pressure. Severe drops in blood pressure can lead to fainting, with a possibility of injury. Moderate drops in blood pressure can cause confusion/inattention, delirium, and episodes of ataxia. Chronic orthostatic hypotension is associated with cerebral hypoperfusion that may accelerate the pathophysiology of dementia. Whether it is a causative factor in dementia is unclear.

The numerous possible causes for orthostatic hypotension include certain medications (e.g. alpha blockers), autonomic neuropathy, decreased blood volume, multiple system atrophy, and age-related blood-vessel stiffness.

Apart from addressing the underlying cause, orthostatic hypotension may be treated with a recommendation to increase salt and water intake (to increase the blood volume), wearing compression stockings, and sometimes medication (fludrocortisone, midodrine, or others). Salt loading (dramatic increases in salt intake) must be supervised by a doctor, as this can cause severe neurological problems if done too aggressively.

==Anatomy and physiology==
To maintain sufficient blood pressure, the body has several compensatory mechanisms. Baroreceptors, a kind of mechanoreceptors, play a crucial role in conveying data about blood pressure in the autonomic nervous system. The data is conveyed to regulate the peripheral resistance and heart output, keeping blood pressure within an established normal limit. There are two kinds of baroreceptors: high-pressure arterial baroreceptors and low-pressure volume receptors, both activated by the stretching of vessel walls.
Arterial baroreceptors are situated in the carotid sinuses and the aortic arch, while the low-pressure volume receptors, known as cardiopulmonary receptors, are in the atria, ventricles, and pulmonary vasculature. Arterial baroreceptors detect changes in blood pressure and transmit this information to the brainstem, the nucleus of the solitary tract, which modulates the activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). This results in decreased blood pressure, which leads to an increase in heart rate. What&#x27;s more, the venoarteriolar axon reflex, which results in the constriction of arterial flow to muscles, skin, and adipose tissue also helps stabilize blood pressure.

==Signs and symptoms==
Orthostatic hypotension is characterized by symptoms that occur after standing (from lying or sitting), particularly when done rapidly. Many report lightheadedness (a feeling that one might be about to faint), sometimes severe, or even actual fainting with associated fall risk. With chronic orthostatic hypotension, the condition and its effects may worsen even as fainting and many other symptoms become less frequent. Generalized weakness or tiredness may also occur. Some also report difficulty concentrating, blurred vision, tremulousness, vertigo, anxiety, palpitations (awareness of the heartbeat), unsteadiness, feeling sweaty or clammy, and sometimes nausea. A person may look pale. Some people may experience severe orthostatic hypotension with the only symptoms being confusion or extreme fatigue. Chronic severe orthostatic hypotension may present as fluctuating cognition/delirium. Women who are pregnant are also susceptible to orthostatic hypotension.

===Associated diseases===
The disorder may be associated with Addison&#x27;s disease, atherosclerosis (build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries), diabetes, pheochromocytoma, porphyria, long COVID, and certain neurological disorders, including autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, multiple system atrophy, and other forms of dysautonomia. It is also associated with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome and anorexia nervosa. It is also present in many patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease or Lewy body dementias resulting from sympathetic denervation of the heart or as a side effect of dopaminomimetic therapy. This rarely leads to fainting unless the person has developed true autonomic failure or has an unrelated heart problem.

Another disease, dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency, also thought to be underdiagnosed, causes loss of sympathetic noradrenergic function and is characterized by low or extremely low levels of norepinephrine, but an excess of dopamine.

Quadriplegics and paraplegics also might experience these symptoms due to multiple systems&#x27; inability to maintain normal blood pressure and blood flow to the upper part of the body.

==Causes==
Some causes of orthostatic hypotension include neurodegenerative disorders, low blood volume (e.g. caused by dehydration, bleeding, or the use of diuretics), drugs that cause vasodilation, other types of drugs (notably, narcotics and marijuana), discontinuation of vasoconstrictors, prolonged bed rest (immobility), significant recent weight loss, anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, or recent bariatric surgery.

===Medication===
Orthostatic hypotension can be a side effect of certain antidepressants, such as tricyclics or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) Alcohol can potentiate orthostatic hypotension to the point of syncope. Orthostatic hypotension can also be a side effect of alpha-1 blockers (alpha1 adrenergic blocking agents). Alpha1 blockers inhibit vasoconstriction normally initiated by the baroreceptor reflex upon postural change and the subsequent drop in pressure. Other antihypertensive medications may also cause orthostatic hypotension, in addition to anticholinergics, dopaminergic drugs, opiates and psychoactive medications.

===Other factors===
Patients prone to orthostatic hypotension are the elderly, &quot;post partum&quot; mothers, and those having been on bed rest. People with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa often develop orthostatic hypotension as a common side effect. Consuming alcohol may also lead to orthostatic hypotension due to its dehydrating effects.

==Mechanism==
Orthostatic hypotension happens when gravity causes blood to pool in the lower extremities, which in turn compromises venous return, resulting in decreased cardiac output and subsequent lowering of arterial pressure. For example, changing from a lying position to standing loses about 700 ml of blood from the thorax, with a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The overall effect is insufficient blood perfusion in the upper part of the body.

Normally, a series of cardiac, vascular, neurologic, muscular, and neurohumoral responses occurs quickly so the blood pressure does not fall very much. One response is a vasoconstriction (baroreceptor reflex), pressing the blood up into the body again. (Often, this mechanism is exaggerated and is why diastolic blood pressure is a bit higher when a person is standing up, compared to a person in the horizontal position.) Therefore, some factor that inhibits one of these responses and causes a greater than normal fall in blood pressure is required. Such factors include low blood volume, diseases, and medications. 

==Diagnosis==
Orthostatic hypotension can be confirmed by measuring a person&#x27;s blood pressure after lying flat for 5 minutes, then 1 minute after standing, and 3 minutes after standing. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a fall in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or the diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg between the supine reading and the upright reading. Also, the heart rate should be measured for both positions. A significant increase in heart rate from supine to standing may indicate a compensatory effort by the heart to maintain cardiac output. A related syndrome, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), is diagnosed when at least a 30 bpm increase in heart rate occurs with little or no change in blood pressure. A tilt table test may also be performed.

===Definition===
Orthostatic hypotension (or postural hypotension) is a drop in blood pressure upon standing. One definition (AAFP) calls for a systolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure decrease of at least 10 mm Hg within 3 minutes of standing. A common first symptom is lightheadedness upon standing, possibly followed by more severe symptoms: narrowing or loss of vision, dizziness, weakness, and even syncope (fainting).

=== Subcategories ===
Orthostatic hypotension can be subcategorized into three groups – initial, classic, and delayed.

Initial orthostatic hypotension is frequently characterized by a systolic blood pressure decrease of ≥40 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure decrease of ≥20 mmHg within 15 seconds of standing. Blood pressure then spontaneously and rapidly returns to normal, so the period of hypotension and symptoms is short (&lt;30 s). Only continuous beat-to-beat BP measurement during an active standing-up maneuver can document this condition.

Classic orthostatic hypotension is frequently characterized by a systolic blood pressure decrease of ≥20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure decrease of ≥10 mmHg between 30 seconds and 3 min of standing.

Delayed orthostatic hypotension is frequently characterized by a sustained systolic blood pressure decrease of ≥20 mm Hg or a sustained diastolic blood pressure decrease ≥of 10 mm Hg beyond 3 minutes of standing or upright tilt table testing.

==Management==
===Lifestyle changes===
Apart from treating underlying reversible causes (e.g., stopping or reducing certain medications, treating autoimmune causes), several measures can improve the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension and prevent episodes of syncope (fainting). Even small increases in the blood pressure may be sufficient to maintain blood flow to the brain on standing.

In dysautonomic patients who do not have a diagnosis of high blood pressure, drinking 2–3 liters of fluid a day and taking 10 g of salt can improve symptoms, by maximizing the amount of fluid in the bloodstream. Another strategy is keeping the head of the bed slightly elevated. This reduces the return of fluid from the limbs to the kidneys at night, thereby reducing nighttime urine production and maintaining fluid in the circulation. Various measures can be used to improve the return of blood to the heart; the wearing of compression stockings and exercises (&quot;physical counterpressure maneuvers&quot; or PCMs) can be undertaken just before standing up (e.g., leg crossing and squatting), as muscular contraction helps return blood from the legs to the upper body.

===Medications===
The medication midodrine, an α1-adrenergic receptor agonist, can benefit people with orthostatic hypotension, The main side effect is piloerection (&quot;goose bumps&quot;). Fludrocortisone is also used, although based on more limited evidence.

Droxidopa, a norepinephrine prodrug and hence non-selective adrenergic receptor agonist, has been shown to be effective as well, with few, mostly mild side effects reported.

A number of other measures have slight evidence to support their use – indomethacin, fluoxetine, dopamine antagonists, metoclopramide, domperidone, monoamine oxidase inhibitors with tyramine (can produce severe hypertension), oxilofrine, potassium chloride, and yohimbine.

Ampreloxetine (TD-9855), a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is in late-stage development for treatment of the condition.

=== Other ===
Robotic devices, such as the Erigo medical device, have been proven to help orthostatic hypotension in some patients. These machines adjust a patient&#x27;s position from 0 degrees to 90 degrees in progressive increments, allowing the blood pressure to adjust more slowly.

==Prognosis==
Orthostatic hypotension may cause accidental falls. It is also linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and stroke. Also, observational data suggest that orthostatic hypotension in middle age increases the risk of eventual dementia and reduced cognitive function.

<text>Carbondale is a city in Jackson County, Illinois, United States, within the Southern Illinois region informally known as &quot;Little Egypt&quot;. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 25,083, making it the most populous city in Southern Illinois outside the Metro East region of Greater St. Louis.

Carbondale was established in 1853 and developed as a crossroads of the railroad industry. Today, the major roadways of Illinois Route 13 and U.S. Route 51 intersect in the city. The city is located southeast of St. Louis on the northern edge of the Shawnee National Forest. It is the home of the main campus of Southern Illinois University.

==History==
In August 1853, Daniel Harmon Brush, John Asgill Conner, and Dr. William Richart bought a parcel of land between two proposed railroad station sites (Makanda and De Soto) and two county seats (Murphysboro and Marion). Brush named Carbondale for the large deposit of coal in the area. The first train through Carbondale arrived on Independence Day 1854, traveling north on the main line from Cairo, Illinois. By the time of the American Civil War, Carbondale had developed as a regional center for transportation and business, surrounded by agricultural development. This part of Illinois was known as &quot;Little Egypt&quot; because of the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, where the town of Cairo is located.

The city has had a college since 1856 beginning with the Presbyterian-founded Carbondale College which was later converted to an elementary school. Carbondale also won the bid for the new state teacher training school for the region, and Southern Illinois Normal University opened in 1874. This gave the town new industry, new citizens, and a supplement to public schools. In 1947, the name was changed to Southern Illinois University (SIU). It has become the flagship of the Southern Illinois University system. This institution, now recognized as a national research university, has nearly 18,000 students enrolled (as of 2014) and offers a wide variety of undergraduate and graduate specialties.

On April 29, 1866, one of the first formal Memorial Day observations following the Civil War was held at the city&#x27;s Woodlawn Cemetery. Local resident, General John A. Logan, gave the principal address. Logan, as co-founder of the Civil War veteran&#x27;s group the &quot;Grand Army of the Republic&quot;, issued General Order #11 on March 3, 1868, calling for a national day of remembrance for Civil War dead. This order served as the basis for the creation of a formal Memorial Day. Logan called observance day &quot;Decoration Day&quot; and proposed it for May 30, to assure flowers would be in bloom nationwide.

In the early 20th century, Carbondale was known as the &quot;Athens of Egypt,&quot; due to the expansion of the college and university, and the region&#x27;s moniker of &quot;Little Egypt.&quot; The phrase dates to at least 1903, when it appeared in a local paper. By 1922, the &quot;Carbondale Free Press&quot; was using the phrase on its flag.

On November 12, 1970, a largescale shootout occurred between local police and members of the local chapter of the Black Panther Party who were meeting at a house in town. The event was later chronicled in the documentary &quot;778 Bullets&quot;, made by a professor at SIU.

An area near campus known as &quot;The Strip&quot; was also the site of several infamous riots on Halloween in the 1980s and 1990s. The last Halloween riot occurred in 2000, when students clashed with and were tear gassed by police. Property and trees in the area of The Strip were destroyed. After the 2000 riot, measures were taken to prevent violence on Halloween weekend. The campus and the bars along Southern Illinois Avenue were closed on Halloween in following years.

===Eclipse Crossroads of America===

The area was in totality during the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, with Giant City State Park, just south of the city, experiencing the longest period of totality during the eclipse (approximately 2 minutes and 40 seconds). It was also within the path of totality of the solar eclipse of April 8, 2024, making it one of only a handful of cities within the direct paths of both eclipses. The combination of these events earned it the nickname &quot;Eclipse Crossroads of America&quot;. In February 2017, the City of Carbondale spent $98,000 to rebrand itself with a new eclipse-themed logo, hiring the marketing consultation firm North Star Destination Strategies, Inc., based out of Colorado, to design the new logo. This rebranding effort aimed to capitalize on the prominence of these celestial events.

==Arts and culture==

In addition to Southern Illinois University, which presents regular concerts and theatrical productions, as well as art and history exhibits, the city has a variety of unique cultural institutions.

SIU has a teaching museum on campus, the University Museum, which has 60,000 artifacts in its collection and hosts traveling shows from known artists. In addition to the University Museum, there is the African American Museum and The Science Center. Theater-goers can see both professional and student-produced plays and performances at the university&#x27;s McLeod and Kleinau Theaters.

King, the Supremes, Ray Charles, and Judy Collins, along with orchestras and other musical productions. Carbondale is also home to Lost Cross, the longest running DIY punk venue in the country, which has hosted local and national acts.

Theater-goers can also attend off-campus productions by The Jackson County Stage Company (Stage Company). In 2007, the Stage Company and Carbondale Community Arts (CCA) partnered to purchase and renovate the Varsity Theater, which had been vacant since 2003, into the Varsity Center for the Arts (VCA). The VCA is now the performing home of the Stage Company and also supports a variety of other fine arts and performances through the CCA.
Civic action is encouraged by groups such as Carbondale Conversations for Community Action (the local implementation of Study Circles). There are several lodges and clubs, such as the Fraternal Order of Eagles, Elks, Rotary International, and the A.F.A.M (Freemasonry).

The Women&#x27;s Center, in continuous service since its founding in 1972, was one of the first domestic violence shelters in the United States.

Spirituality finds expression in Carbondale in churches of a variety of Christian denominations, a Unitarian Universalist fellowship, two mosques, a Jewish congregation, a Sufi community, and two Buddhist organizations – the Shawnee Dharma Group and the Sunyata Center. The first Hindu temple in Southern Illinois held its grand opening in Carbondale in June 2013. The Gaia House Interfaith Center provides space for intercultural exchange and personal growth. It is also an education center to help the community become more ecologically conscious, understand how to incorporate better practices into daily life, and set goals for the future.

Notable poets that reside in or near Carbondale include Rodney Jones, Judy Jordan, Allison Joseph, and the Transpoetic Playground collective.

Carbondale also has a growing stand-up comedy scene, notably including Hannibal Buress, who began his comedy career in the city.

Several bars and coffeehouses offer live music, poetry readings, and other entertainment. The Carbondale Chamber of Commerce offers information on local businesses in over 60 categories.

==Parks and recreation==

Carbondale has 18 public tennis courts. It is home to the Superblock, which is a sports multi-complex with baseball, softball, soccer, football, and track fields.

The Shawnee National Forest, close to Carbondale, is home to many wineries. The Shawnee Hills Wine Trail visits twelve vineyards in scenic settings, offering local wines and dining facilities. Several of the vineyards are bed-and-breakfasts or offer cabins for close accommodations.

The presence of Southern Illinois University also means that Carbondale area residents can attend Division I events of SIU&#x27;s &quot;Salukis&quot; sport teams. The mascot term &quot;Salukis&quot; is a reference to a dog breed from ancient Egypt, a nod to the fact that the Southern Illinois region is frequently referred to by the nickname &quot;Little Egypt.&quot;

==Activism==
Due to the presence of Southern Illinois University, Carbondale residents have a tradition of political activism. During the Vietnam War, and especially after the Kent State shootings, massive anti-war demonstrations took place on the SIU campus and on the streets of Carbondale. They resulted in the closure of SIU, more than $100,000 of property damage, more than 400 arrests, and the deployment of the National Guard to restore order.

In 2011, the Occupy Movement took up residence on the lawn of Quigley Hall at Southern Illinois University, occasionally clashing with local police and with university policy.

SIU&#x27;s Faculty Association went to the picket lines on November 3, 2011, after an agreement could not be reached between the Association and the administration concerning contracts. The other unions—the Non-Tenure Track Faculty Association, the Association of Civil Service Employees, and Graduate Assistants United—all settled with the administration within hours of the picketing action. The Faculty Association came to an agreement with the administration on November 10. The strike was the first ever in the school&#x27;s history.

Several local organizations are concerned with peace, justice and the environment, including the Peace Coalition of Southern Illinois/Fellowship of Reconciliation, the Shawnee Green Party, the Student Environmental Center, the Southern Illinois Center for a Sustainable Future, and local chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union, the Sierra Club, and the National Audubon Society.

In 2001, the city was the location for the national Green Party Congress.

==Government==
The city of Carbondale has a council-manager government. There are a total of seven elected city officials: a mayor and six city council members elected at-large for four-year staggered terms. The City Manager, a professional hired by the city council, appoints the department heads. The city provides services such as police, fire, development services, public works, and public library. Several boards and commissions allow for citizen participation, bringing more citizens into civic activities and helping to bridge the gap between the residents and the government. Carbondale is a zoned, home rule municipality. In 2010, the city approved a new comprehensive plan that lays out goals for the future and ways to accomplish these goals.
On April 5, 2011, Joel Fritzler was elected mayor for a four-year term, but on February 3, 2014, he resigned to accept a job in Arizona. The City Council chose Don Monty as acting mayor to finish Fritzler&#x27;s term. On April 7, 2015, John &quot;Mike&quot; Henry was elected mayor, and he took office in May 2015. On April 4, 2023, Carolin Harvey was elected mayor, the first African-American to hold the office; Harvey had been acting mayor since Henry took a leave of absence.

==Media==
PBS and NPR broadcasting stations (WSIU) are affiliated with the university. Carbondale also is home to WDBX Community Radio for Southern Illinois, and the Big Muddy Independent Media Center.

The area is served by a regional daily newspaper, &quot;The Southern Illinoisan&quot; and the university&#x27;s &quot;Daily Egyptian&quot;, as well as two weeklies, the &quot;Carbondale Times&quot; and the &quot;Nightlife.&quot;

Amtrak Train 58, the northbound &quot;City of New Orleans&quot;, departs Carbondale daily with service to Centralia, Effingham, Mattoon, Champaign-Urbana, Kankakee, Homewood, and Chicago.

Carbondale is also served by Amtrak Train 390/391, the &quot;Saluki&quot;, daily in the morning, and Amtrak Train 392/393, the &quot;Illini&quot;, daily in the afternoon/evening. Both the &quot;Saluki&quot; and the &quot;Illini&quot; operate to Chicago, originating and terminating in Carbondale.

Amtrak uses the tracks of the Canadian National Railway, which provides freight service to the city&#x27;s industrial park. The railroad runs along the original line of the Illinois Central Railroad that began service in 1854 in Carbondale.

===Air service===
The city is away from the Williamson County Regional Airport, where Contour Airlines provides passenger service to Chicago O’Hare.

The Southern Illinois Airport is located northwest of the city and offers private aviation services and is home to SIU&#x27;s aviation program. On April 2, 2010, state and university officials broke ground on a Transportation Education Center on the airport grounds.

===Public transit===
The Saluki Express provides bus service around the city. SIUC students, faculty, and staff, as well as the greater Carbondale community, are encouraged to use the service. This system offers eleven routes operating seven days a week while the university is in session, and a &quot;break route&quot; operating during semester breaks.

Local public transit is also provided by Jackson County Mass Transit District, which operates seven days a week, Rides Mass Transit District, which provides bi-hourly service between Carbondale and Marion six days a week, and South Central Transit, which operates a weekday regional service between Pinckneyville, Du Quion, and Carbondale.

==Healthcare==

Carbondale did not provide abortions from 1985 to 2022, but after the &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; court ruling in 2022 paved the way for many US states to prohibit abortion, Carbondale experienced a sharp rise in the number of abortion providers thanks to it being the closest town with legal abortion access to many southern U.S. states such as Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi, with the Choices abortion clinic moving there from Memphis, Tennessee.

Carbondale&#x27;s location in Southern Illinois, south of the Missouri River to the west and the Ohio River to the east, and north of the Mississippi River, makes it a central geographic area with close proximity to the Southern United States. Carbondale is along the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; train, whose route extends between Chicago and New Orleans.

<text>The was a militant communist organization active from 1971 to 2001. It was designated a terrorist organization by Japan and the United States. The JRA was founded by Fusako Shigenobu and Tsuyoshi Okudaira in February 1971, and was most active in the 1970s and 1980s, operating mostly out of Lebanon with PFLP collaboration and funding from Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s Libya, as well as Syria and North Korea.

After the Lod Airport massacre, it sometimes called itself the Arab-JRA. The group was also variously known as the Anti-Imperialist International Brigade (AIIB), the Holy War Brigade, and the Anti-War Democratic Front. The JRA&#x27;s stated goals were to overthrow the Japanese government and the monarchy, as well as to start a world revolution.

== History ==
Fusako Shigenobu had been a leading member in the in Japan, whose roots lay in the Communist League, part of the militant New Left in Japan. Advocating revolution through terrorism, they set up their own group, declaring war on the state in September 1969. The police quickly arrested many of them, including founder and intellectual leader Takaya Shiomi, who was in jail by 1970. The Red Army Faction lost about 200 members, and the remnants merged with the Maoist group Revolutionary Left Faction () to form the in July 1971. The United Red Army became notable during the Asama-Sanso incident, when it murdered fourteen of its members on Mount Haruna, before a week-long siege involving hundreds of police leaving a bystander and a police officer dead.

Fusako Shigenobu had left Japan with only a handful of dedicated people, but her group is said to have had about 40 members at its height and was, after the Lod Airport massacre, one of the best-known armed leftist groups in the world.

The JRA had close ties with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Wadie Haddad. It was dependent on the PFLP for financing, training, and weaponry.

In April 2001, Shigenobu issued a statement from detention declaring the JRA had disbanded, and that their battles should henceforth be done by legal means.

The National Police Agency publicly stated that a successor group was founded in 2001, called .

On February 15, 2022, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department renewed calls for arresting other ex-JRA terrorists who have not been arrested, including Kunio Bando and Kozo Okamoto.

== Activities ==

During the 1970s and 1980s, JRA carried out a series of attacks in Japan and around the world, including:

* May 30, 1972: the Lod Airport massacre; a gun and grenade attack at Israel&#x27;s Lod Airport in Tel Aviv, now Ben Gurion International Airport, killed 26 people; about 80 others were wounded. One of the three attackers then committed suicide with a grenade, another was shot in the crossfire. The only surviving attacker was Kōzō Okamoto. Many of the victims were Christian pilgrims.
* July 1973: Red Army members led the hijacking of Japan Air Lines Flight 404 over the Netherlands. The passengers and crew were released in Libya, where the hijackers blew up the aircraft.
* January 1974: the Laju incident; the JRA attacked a Shell facility in Singapore and took five hostages; simultaneously, the PFLP seized the Japanese embassy in Kuwait. The hostages were exchanged for a ransom and safe passage to South Yemen.
* September 13, 1974: the French Embassy in The Hague, Netherlands was stormed. The ambassador and ten other people were taken hostage and a Dutch policewoman, Joke Remmerswaal, was shot in the back, puncturing a lung. After lengthy negotiations, the hostages were freed in exchange for the release of a jailed Red Army member (Yatsuka Furuya), $300,000 and the use of an aircraft. The hostage-takers flew first to Aden, South Yemen, where they were not accepted and then to Syria. Syria did not consider hostage-taking for money revolutionary, and forced them to give up their ransom.
* August 1975: the Red Army took more than 50 hostages at the AIA building housing several embassies in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The hostages included the US consul and the Swedish chargé d&#x27;affaires. The gunmen won the release of five imprisoned comrades and flew with them to Libya.
* September 1977: The Red Army hijacked Japan Airlines Flight 472 over India and forced it to land in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The Japanese Government freed six imprisoned members of the group and allegedly paid a $6M ransom.
* December 1977: a suspected lone member of the Red Army hijacked Malaysian Airline System Flight 653. The flight was carrying the Cuban ambassador to Tokyo, Mario Garcia. The Boeing 737 crashed killing all 100 passengers and crew on board.
* May 1986: the Red Army fired mortar rounds at the embassies of Japan, Canada and the United States in Jakarta, Indonesia.
* November 1986: The New Peoples Army, a branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines, kidnapped Nobuyuki Wakaouji, the branch manager of Mitsui &amp; Co. in Manila, Philippines with a ransom of $10 million (1.2 billion yen) paid, although there were initial demands for a ransom of $8 million. According to CPP spokesman Gregorio Rosal, the kidnapping was condemned by the party. There is still speculation that the JRA helped in the abduction.
* June 1987: a similar attack was launched on the British and United States embassies in Rome, Italy.
* April 1988: Red Army members detonated a car bomb outside of a USO recreational facility in Naples, which killed 4 Italian civilians and 1 U.S. servicewoman, and injured 15 others.
* In the same month, JRA operative Yū Kikumura was arrested with explosives on the New Jersey Turnpike highway, apparently to coincide with the USO bombing. He was convicted of these charges and served time in a United States prison until his release in April 2007. Upon his return to Japan he was immediately arrested on suspicion of using fraudulent travel documents.

== Known members ==
* Fusako Shigenobu, co-founder and leader, arrested in Osaka, Japan, November 2000 and stood accused of orchestrating attacks, kidnappings and . A court in Tokyo sentenced her in February 2006 to serve 20 years in prison for attempted murder, kidnapping and confinement for her part in helping to plan the 1974 French Embassy attack in The Hague. Shigenobu was released on May 28, 2022.
* Tsuyoshi Okudaira, co-founder and leader, killed while carrying out the Lod Airport massacre.
* Osamu Maruoka, former leader and hijacker of two aircraft, was arrested in November 1987 in Tokyo after entering Japan on a forged passport. Given a life sentence, he died in prison on May 29, 2011.
* Haruo Wakō, former leader, arrested in Lebanon in February 1997 before being deported to Japan to be sentenced further.
* Masao Adachi, Kazuo Tohira, and Mariko Yamamoto were also imprisoned in Lebanon on charges of forgery yet were subsequently sent to Jordan before being handed over to Japan.
* Kuniya Akagi, a collaborator of the JRA, was arrested after returning to Osaka from Pyongyang via Beijing in order to be questioned over the kidnapping of three Japanese nationals in Europe by North Korean spies in the 1980s. He is linked to Shirō Akagi, who took part in the &quot;Yodo-go&quot; hijacking (See also: Japan Airlines Flight 351).
* Kunio Bando, one of the hijackers of Japan Airlines Flight 472, is still on Interpol&#x27;s wanted list. He may have taken refuge in the Philippines in 2000.
* Ayako Daidōji, a former member of East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front who joined the JRA in 1979, is on the wanted list and still at large.
* Yukiko Ekida, a former member of East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front who joined the JRA in 1979, was arrested in March 1995 in Romania and subsequently deported to Japan. She received a sentence of 20 years for attempted murder and violating the explosives law in a series of bombings targeting large companies in 1974 and 1975. The trial of Ekida was originally started in 1975 but was suspended when she was released from prison in 1977. Her release was part of a deal with the Japanese Red Army during the hijacking of a Japanese airliner to Bangladesh.
* Yatsuka Furuya (birth name: Yoshiaki Yamada) joined the JRA in 1973 and took part in the Laju ferry hijacking in Singapore in 1974. His arrest in Paris later that year precipitated the French Embassy attack to free Furuya, as the JRA was concerned he might reveal their organizational structure and plans to French police. Arrested again in 1986, he was imprisoned for a year, but was released after his sentence expired and is now free, albeit under constant police surveillance.
* Yū Kikumura was arrested with explosives on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1988 and served over 18 years of a 30‑year prison sentence in the United States. In April 2007, Kikumura was released from US incarceration and immediately arrested upon his return to Japan. He was released in October 2007.
* Hisashi Matsuda, one of the hostage takers at the AIA building siege in Kuala Lumpur, is on the wanted list and still at large.
* Akira Nihei, one of the hijackers of Japan Airlines Flight 472, is wanted and still at large.
* Jun Nishikawa – One of the attackers of the French Embassy at The Hague in 1974, was arrested in Stockholm before being released later that year as part of a deal with the Japanese government to free the hostages that JRA had taken in the AIA building siege in Kuala Lumpur. After 20 years in hiding, he was arrested in Bolivia and deported to Japan, where he was tried and sentenced to life in prison.
* Kōzō Okamoto is the only survivor of the group of three JRA terrorists (alongside Tsuyoshi Okudaira and Yasuyuki Yasuda) attacking Lod airport in 1972, now called Ben Gurion International Airport. He was jailed in Israel, but in May 1985, Okamoto was set free in an exchange of prisoners between Israeli and Palestinian forces. Subsequently, he was imprisoned in Lebanon for three years for forging visas and passports. The Lebanese authorities granted Okamoto political asylum in 1999 for having participated in attacks against Israel and being allegedly tortured while serving his prison sentence in Israel.
* Junzō Okudaira was one of the three Japanese Red Army (JRA) members who attacked the French embassy in The Hague in 1974 and was the person who detonated a car bomb in front of a USO club in Naples in 1988. As of 2022, he remains at large.
* Norio Sasaki, one of the hijackers of Japan Airlines Flight 472, is wanted and still at large.
* Hiroshi Sensui, a JRA militant living in the Philippines, was arrested by the Integrated National Police as part of anti-terrorist measures to prevent terrorist incidents from taking place in the Seoul Olympic games after being tipped off by the Japanese National Police Agency.
* Tsutomu Shirosaki, an alleged conspirator who fired two mortar shells towards the Embassy of Japan, United States and Canada from a room in President Hotel (now Pullman Hotel) in the Jakarta, Indonesia on May 14, 1986. Nobody was injured in the incident as the bombs did not explode. United States court sentenced Shirosaki to 30 years in prison in 1998 for attempted murder and other crimes in connection with the mortar attack. His prison sentence was shortened for good behaviour and he was released in January 2015. When Shirosaki returned to Japan the following month, Tokyo police arrested him for alleged arson and attempted murder in connection with the 1986 mortar attack. In November 2016, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison but he died in July 2024.
* Yoshimi Tanaka was arrested in Cambodia in 1996 and extradited to Japan. A Tokyo court sentenced him to 12 years in prison in 2002 for his involvement in the Yodo-go hijacking, in which a Japan Airlines plane was hijacked to North Korea. He died in 2007.
* Kazue Yoshimura, reported to have taken part in the hostage crisis in The Hague, was arrested by Peruvian DIRCOTE agents in Lima on May 25, 1996, after alleged contacts with members of the Maoist Shining Path (SP) insurgency (even possibly with then-head of the organization Comrade Feliciano). The trace to her arrest was established after the 1995 Bucharest capture of Yukiko Ekita with a false Peruvian passport. Yoshimura had first entered Peru in February 1993 with a Philippine passport and later returned with the name of Yoko Okuyama, supposedly intended on travelling to the coca-growing Huallaga Valley, the last stronghold of the diminished Peruvian Maoist insurgency as well as a drug-trafficking haven. According to Peruvian &quot;Caretas&quot; magazine, she was intending on helping establish a JRA presence in South America and may have even established contacts with Jun Nishikawa, another JRA operative later captured in Bolivia. Yoshimura was later deported to Japan by the government of Alberto Fujimori (a Japanese Peruvian), who stated that there was no proof against her despite the overwhelming intelligence data. The move was allegedly the result of pressure from the Japanese authorities. In December 1997, Yoshimura was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment for passport forgery.

<doc id="101965" wikidata="Q179945" url="?curid=101965" title="Psoriasis">
<text>Psoriasis is a long-lasting, noncontagious autoimmune disease characterized by patches of abnormal skin. These areas are red, pink, or purple, dry, itchy, and scaly. Psoriasis varies in severity from small localized patches to complete body coverage. Injury to the skin can trigger psoriatic skin changes at that spot, which is known as the Koebner phenomenon.

The five main types of psoriasis are plaque, guttate, inverse, pustular, and erythrodermic. Plaque psoriasis, also known as psoriasis vulgaris, makes up about 90% of cases. It typically presents as red patches with white scales on top. Areas of the body most commonly affected are the back of the forearms, shins, navel area, and scalp. Guttate psoriasis has drop-shaped lesions. Pustular psoriasis presents as small, noninfectious, pus-filled blisters. Inverse psoriasis forms red patches in skin folds. Erythrodermic psoriasis occurs when the rash becomes very widespread and can develop from any of the other types. Fingernails and toenails are affected in most people with psoriasis at some point in time. This may include pits in the nails or changes in nail color.

Psoriasis is generally thought to be a genetic disease that is triggered by environmental factors. If one twin has psoriasis, the other twin is three times more likely to be affected if the twins are identical than if they are nonidentical. This suggests that genetic factors predispose to psoriasis. Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications, such as beta blockers or NSAIDs. Infections and psychological stress can also play a role. The underlying mechanism involves the immune system reacting to skin cells. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.

There is no known cure for psoriasis, but various treatments can help control the symptoms. These treatments include steroid creams, vitamin D3 cream, ultraviolet light, immunosuppressive drugs, such as methotrexate, and biologic therapies targeting specific immunologic pathways. About 75% of skin involvement improves with creams alone. The disease affects 2–4% of the population. Men and women are affected with equal frequency. The disease may begin at any age, but typically starts in adulthood. Psoriasis is associated with an increased risk of psoriatic arthritis, lymphomas, cardiovascular disease, Crohn&#x27;s disease, and depression. Psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30% of individuals with psoriasis.

The word &quot;psoriasis&quot; is from Greek meaning or , from , and .

==Signs and symptoms==

===Plaque psoriasis===

Psoriasis vulgaris (also known as chronic stationary psoriasis or plaque-like psoriasis) is the most common form and affects 85–90% of people with psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis typically appears as raised areas of inflamed skin covered with silvery-white, scaly skin. These areas are called plaques and are most commonly found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and back.

=== Other forms ===
Additional types of psoriasis comprise about 10% of cases. They include pustular, inverse, napkin, guttate, oral, and seborrheic-like forms.

====Pustular psoriasis====

Pustular psoriasis appears as raised bumps filled with noninfectious pus (pustules). The skin under and surrounding the pustules is red and tender. Pustular psoriasis can either be localized or more widespread throughout the body. Two types of localized pustular psoriasis include psoriasis pustulosa palmoplantaris and acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau; both forms are localized to the hands and feet.

==== Inverse psoriasis ====
Inverse psoriasis (also known as flexural psoriasis) appears as smooth, inflamed patches of skin. The patches frequently affect skin folds, particularly around the genitals (between the thigh and groin), the armpits, in the skin folds of an overweight abdomen (known as panniculus), between the buttocks in the intergluteal cleft, and under the breasts in the inframammary fold. Heat, trauma, and infection are thought to play a role in the development of this atypical form of psoriasis.

==== Napkin psoriasis ====
Napkin psoriasis is a subtype of psoriasis common in infants under the age of two and is characterized by red papules with silver scales in the diaper area that may extend to the torso or limbs. Napkin psoriasis is often misdiagnosed as napkin dermatitis (diaper rash). It typically improves as children age and may later present in more common forms as plaque psoriasis or inverse psoriasis.

==== Guttate psoriasis ====

Guttate psoriasis is an inflammatory condition characterized by numerous small, scaly, red or pink, droplet-like lesions (papules). These numerous papules appear over large areas of the body, primarily the trunk, limbs, and scalp, but typically spare the palms and soles. Guttate psoriasis is often triggered by a streptococcal infection (oropharyngeal or perianal) and typically occurs 1–3 weeks post-infection. Guttate psoriasis is most commonly seen in children and young adults and diagnosis is typically made based on history and clinical exam findings. Skin biopsy can also be performed which typically shows a psoriasiform reaction pattern characterized by epidermal hyperplasia with elongation of the rete ridges.

There is no firm evidence regarding the best management for guttate psoriasis; however, first-line therapy for mild guttate psoriasis typically includes topical corticosteroids. Phototherapy can be used for moderate or severe guttate psoriasis. Biologic treatments have not been well studied in the treatment of guttate psoriasis.

Guttate psoriasis has a better prognosis than plaque psoriasis and typically resolves within 1–3 weeks; however, up to 40% of patients with guttate psoriasis eventually convert to plaque psoriasis.

==== Erythrodermic psoriasis ====
Psoriatic erythroderma (erythrodermic psoriasis) involves widespread inflammation and exfoliation of the skin over most of the body surface, often involving greater than 90% of the body surface area. It may be accompanied by severe dryness, itching, swelling, and pain. It can develop from any type of psoriasis. It is often the result of an exacerbation of unstable plaque psoriasis, particularly following the abrupt withdrawal of systemic glucocorticoids. This form of psoriasis can be fatal as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body&#x27;s ability to regulate temperature and perform barrier functions.

==== Mouth ====
Psoriasis in the mouth is very rare, in contrast to lichen planus, another common papulosquamous disorder that commonly involves both the skin and mouth. When psoriasis involves the oral mucosa (the lining of the mouth), it may be asymptomatic, but it may appear as white or grey-yellow plaques. Fissured tongue is the most common finding in those with oral psoriasis and has been reported to occur in 6.5–20% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin. The microscopic appearance of oral mucosa affected by geographic tongue (migratory stomatitis) is very similar to the appearance of psoriasis. A recent study found an association between the two conditions, and it suggests that geographic tongue might be a predictor to psoriasis.

==== Seborrheic-like psoriasis ====
Seborrheic-like psoriasis is a common form of psoriasis with clinical aspects of psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis, and it may be difficult to distinguish from the latter. This form of psoriasis typically manifests as red plaques with greasy scales in areas of higher sebum production such as the scalp, forehead, skin folds next to the nose, the skin surrounding the mouth, skin on the chest above the sternum, and in skin folds.

===Psoriatic arthritis===
Psoriatic arthritis is a form of chronic inflammatory arthritis that has a highly variable clinical presentation and frequently occurs in association with skin and nail psoriasis. It typically involves painful inflammation of the joints and surrounding connective tissue and can occur in any joint, but most commonly affects the joints of the fingers and toes. This can result in a sausage-shaped swelling of the fingers and toes known as dactylitis. Psoriatic arthritis can also affect the hips, knees, spine (spondylitis), and sacroiliac joint (sacroiliitis). About 30% of individuals with psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis. Skin manifestations of psoriasis tend to occur before arthritic manifestations in about 75% of cases.

===Nail changes===
Psoriasis can affect the nails and produces a variety of changes in the appearance of fingers and toenails. Nail psoriasis occurs in 40–45% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin, and has a lifetime incidence of 80–90% in those with psoriatic arthritis. These changes include pitting of the nails (pinhead-sized depressions in the nail is seen in 70% with nail psoriasis), whitening of the nail, small areas of bleeding from capillaries under the nail, yellow-reddish discoloration of the nails known as the oil drop or salmon spots, dryness, thickening of the skin under the nail (subungual hyperkeratosis), loosening and separation of the nail (onycholysis), and crumbling of the nail.

===Medical signs===
In addition to the appearance and distribution of the rash, specific medical signs may be used by medical practitioners to assist with diagnosis. These may include Auspitz&#x27;s sign (pinpoint bleeding when the scale is removed), Koebner phenomenon (psoriatic skin lesions induced by trauma to the skin), and itching and pain localized to papules and plaques.

==Causes==
The cause of psoriasis is not fully understood. Genetics, seasonal changes, skin damage, climate, immunocompromised state, specific infections, and the use of some medications have been connected with different types of psoriasis.

===Genetics===

Around one-third of people with psoriasis report a family history of the disease, and researchers have identified genetic loci associated with the condition. Identical twin studies suggest a 70% chance of a twin developing psoriasis if the other twin has the disorder. The risk is around 20% for fraternal twins. These findings suggest both a genetic susceptibility and an environmental response in developing psoriasis.

Psoriasis has a strong hereditary component, and many genes are associated with it, but how those genes work together is unclear. Most of the identified genes relate to the immune system, particularly the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and T cells. Genetic studies are valuable due to their ability to identify molecular mechanisms and pathways for further study and potential medication targets.

Classic genome-wide linkage analysis has identified nine loci on different chromosomes associated with psoriasis. They are called psoriasis susceptibility 1 through 9 (&quot;PSORS1&quot; through &quot;PSORS9&quot;). Within those loci are genes on pathways that lead to inflammation. Certain variations (mutations) of those genes are commonly found in psoriasis. Genome-wide association scans have identified other genes that are altered to characteristic variants in psoriasis. Some of these genes express inflammatory signal proteins, which affect cells in the immune system that are also involved in psoriasis. Some of these genes are also involved in other autoimmune diseases.

The major determinant is &quot;PSORS1&quot;, which probably accounts for 35–50% of psoriasis heritability. It controls genes that affect the immune system or encode skin proteins that are overabundant with psoriasis. &quot;PSORS1&quot; is located on chromosome 6 in the MHC, which controls important immune functions. Three genes in the &quot;PSORS1&quot; locus have a strong association with psoriasis vulgaris: &quot;HLA-C&quot; variant &quot;HLA-Cw6&quot;, which encodes an MHC class I protein; &quot;CCHCR1&quot;, variant WWC, which encodes a coiled coil protein overexpressed in psoriatic epidermis; and &quot;CDSN&quot;, variant allele 5, which encodes corneodesmosin, a protein expressed in the granular and cornified layers of the epidermis and upregulated in psoriasis.

Two major immune system genes under investigation are interleukin-12 subunit beta (&quot;IL12B&quot;) on chromosome 5q, which expresses interleukin-12B; and &quot;IL23R&quot; on chromosome 1p, which expresses the interleukin-23 receptor and is involved in T cell differentiation. Interleukin-23 receptor and &quot;IL12B&quot; have both been strongly linked with psoriasis. T cells are involved in the inflammatory process that leads to psoriasis. These genes are on the pathway that upregulates tumor necrosis factor-α and nuclear factor κB, two genes involved in inflammation. The first gene directly linked to psoriasis was identified as the &quot;CARD14 &quot;gene located in the &quot;PSORS2&quot; locus. A rare mutation in the gene encoding for the &quot;CARD14&quot;-regulated protein plus an environmental trigger was enough to cause plaque psoriasis (the most common form of psoriasis).

===Lifestyle===
Conditions reported as worsening the disease include chronic infections, stress, and changes in season and climate. Other factors that might worsen the condition include hot water, scratching psoriasis skin lesions, skin dryness, excessive alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and obesity. The effects of stopping cigarette smoking or alcohol misuse have yet to be studied as of 2019.

===HIV===
The rate of psoriasis in human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV) individuals is comparable to that of HIV-negative individuals, but psoriasis tends to be more severe in people infected with HIV. A much higher rate of psoriatic arthritis occurs in HIV-positive individuals with psoriasis than in those without the infection. The immune response in those infected with HIV is typically characterized by cellular signals from Th2 subset of CD4+ helper T cells, whereas the immune response in psoriasis vulgaris is characterized by a pattern of cellular signals typical of Th1 subset of CD4+ helper T cells and Th17 helper T cells. The diminished CD4+-T cell presence is thought to cause overactivation of CD8+-T cells, which are responsible for the exacerbation of psoriasis in HIV-positive people. Psoriasis in those with HIV/AIDS is often severe and may be untreatable with conventional therapy. In those with long-term, well-controlled psoriasis, new HIV infection can trigger a severe flare-up of psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis.

=== Microbes ===
Psoriasis has been described as occurring after strep throat, and may be worsened by skin or gut colonization with &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Malassezia&quot; spp., and &quot;Candida albicans&quot;. Guttate psoriasis often affects children and adolescents and can be triggered by a recent group A streptococcal infection (tonsillitis or pharyngitis).

===Medications===
Drug-induced psoriasis may occur with beta blockers, lithium, antimalarial medications, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, terbinafine, calcium channel blockers, captopril, glyburide, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukins, interferons, lipid-lowering medications, and paradoxically TNF inhibitors such as infliximab or adalimumab. Withdrawal of corticosteroids (topical steroid cream) can aggravate psoriasis due to the rebound effect.

==Pathophysiology==
Psoriasis is characterized by an abnormally excessive and rapid growth of the epidermal layer of the skin. Abnormal production of skin cells (especially during wound repair) and an overabundance of skin cells result from the sequence of pathological events in psoriasis. The sequence of pathological events in psoriasis is thought to start with an initiation phase in which an event (skin trauma, infection, or drugs) leads to activation of the immune system and then the maintenance phase consisting of chronic progression of the disease. Skin cells are replaced every 3–5 days in psoriasis rather than the usual 28–30 days. These changes are believed to stem from the premature maturation of keratinocytes induced by an inflammatory cascade in the dermis involving dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cells (three subtypes of immune cells). These immune cells move from the dermis to the epidermis and secrete inflammatory chemical signals (cytokines) such as interleukin-36γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and interleukin-22. These secreted inflammatory signals are believed to stimulate keratinocytes to proliferate. One hypothesis is that psoriasis involves a defect in regulatory T cells, and in the regulatory cytokine interleukin-10. The inflammatory cytokines found in psoriatic nails and joints (in the case of psoriatic arthritis) are similar to those of psoriatic skin lesions, suggesting a common inflammatory mechanism.

Gene mutations of proteins involved in the skin&#x27;s ability to function as a barrier have been identified as markers of susceptibility for the development of psoriasis.

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) released from dying cells acts as an inflammatory stimulus in psoriasis and stimulates the receptors on certain dendritic cells, which in turn produce the cytokine interferon-α. In response to these chemical messages from dendritic cells and T cells, keratinocytes also secrete cytokines such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α, which signal downstream inflammatory cells to arrive and stimulate additional inflammation.

Dendritic cells bridge the innate immune system and adaptive immune system. They are increased in psoriatic lesions and induce the proliferation of T cells and type 1 helper T cells (Th1). Targeted immunotherapy, as well as psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy, can reduce the number of dendritic cells and favors a TH2 cell cytokine secretion pattern over a Th1/Th17 cell cytokine profile. Psoriatic T cells move from the dermis into the epidermis and secrete interferon-γ and interleukin-17. Interleukin-23 is known to induce the production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22. Interleukin-22 works in combination with interleukin-17 to induce keratinocytes to secrete neutrophil-attracting cytokines.

==Diagnosis==

A diagnosis of psoriasis is usually based on the appearance of the skin. Skin characteristics typical for psoriasis are scaly, erythematous plaques, papules, or patches of skin that may be painful and itch. No special blood tests or diagnostic procedures are usually required to make the diagnosis.

The differential diagnosis of psoriasis includes dermatological conditions similar in appearance such as discoid eczema, seborrheic eczema, pityriasis rosea (may be confused with guttate psoriasis), nail fungus (may be confused with nail psoriasis) or cutaneous T cell lymphoma (50% of individuals with this cancer are initially misdiagnosed with psoriasis). Dermatologic manifestations of systemic illnesses such as the rash of secondary syphilis may also be confused with psoriasis.

If the clinical diagnosis is uncertain, a skin biopsy or scraping may be performed to rule out other disorders and to confirm the diagnosis. Skin from a biopsy shows clubbed epidermal projections that interdigitate with dermis on microscopy. Epidermal thickening is another characteristic histologic finding of psoriasis lesions. The stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis is often missing or significantly decreased in psoriatic lesions; the skin cells from the most superficial layer of skin are also abnormal as they never fully mature. Unlike their mature counterparts, these superficial cells keep their nuclei. Inflammatory infiltrates can typically be seen on microscopy when examining skin tissue or joint tissue affected by psoriasis. Epidermal skin tissue affected by psoriatic inflammation often has many CD8+ T cells, while a predominance of CD4+ T cells makes up the inflammatory infiltrates of the dermal layer of skin and joints.

===Classification===

====Morphological====
Psoriasis is classified as a papulosquamous disorder and is most commonly subdivided into different categories based on histological characteristics. Variants include plaque, pustular, guttate, and flexural psoriasis. Each form has a dedicated ICD-10 code. Psoriasis can also be classified into nonpustular and pustular types.

====Pathogenetic====
Another classification scheme considers genetic and demographic factors. Type 1 has a positive family history, starts before the age of 40, and is associated with the human leukocyte antigen, &quot;HLA-Cw6&quot;. Conversely, type 2 does not show a family history, presents after age 40, and is not associated with &quot;HLA-Cw6&quot;. Type 1 accounts for about 75% of persons with psoriasis.

The classification of psoriasis as an autoimmune disease has sparked considerable debate. Researchers have proposed differing descriptions of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; some authors have classified them as autoimmune diseases while others have classified them as distinct from autoimmune diseases and referred to them as immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

====Severity====

No consensus exists about how to classify the severity of psoriasis. Mild psoriasis has been defined as a percentage of body surface area (BSA)≤10, a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score ≤10, and a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score ≤10. Moderate to severe psoriasis was defined by the same group as BSA &gt;10 or PASI score &gt;10 and a DLQI score &gt;10.

The DLQI is a 10-question tool used to measure the impact of several dermatologic diseases on daily functioning. The DLQI score ranges from 0 (minimal impairment) to 30 (maximal impairment) and is calculated with each answer being assigned 0–3 points with higher scores indicating greater social or occupational impairment.

The PASI is the most widely used measurement tool for psoriasis. It assesses the severity of lesions and the area affected and combines these two factors into a single score from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). Nevertheless, the PASI can be too unwieldy to use outside of research settings, which has led to attempts to simplify the index for clinical use.

== Co-morbidities ==
Psoriasis is not just a skin disease. The symptoms of psoriasis can sometimes go beyond the skin and can have a negative impact on the quality of life of the affected individuals. Additionally, the co-morbidities increase the treatment and financial burden of psoriasis and should be considered when managing this condition.

=== Cardiovascular complications ===
There is 2.2 times increased risk of cardiovascular complications in people with psoriasis. Also, people with psoriasis are more susceptible to myocardial infarction (heart attack) and stroke. It has been speculated that there is systemic inflammation in psoriasis, which drives “psoriatic march” and can cause other inflammatory complications including cardiovascular complications. A study used fluorodeoxyglucose F-18 positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) to measure aortic vascular inflammation in psoriasis patients, and found increased coronary artery disease indices, including total plaque burden, luminal stenosis, and high-risk plaques in people with psoriasis. Similarly, it was found that there is an 11% reduction in aortic vascular inflammation when there is a 75% reduction in the PASI score.

=== Depression ===
Depression or depressive symptoms are present in 28–55% of people with psoriasis. People with psoriasis are often stigmatized due to visible disfigurement of the skin. Social stigmatization is a risk factor for depression, however, other immune system factors may also be related to this observed increased incidence of depression in people with psoriasis. There is some evidence that increased inflammatory signals in the body could also contribute to depression in people with chronic inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis.

=== Type 2 diabetes ===
People with psoriasis are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (~1.5 odds ratio). A genome-wide genetic study found that psoriasis and type 2 diabetes share four loci, namely, ACTR2, ERLIN1, TRMT112, and BECN1, which are connected via inflammatory NF-κB pathway.

==Management==

While no cure is available for psoriasis, many treatment options exist. Topical agents are typically used for mild disease, phototherapy for moderate disease, and systemic agents for severe disease. There is no evidence to support the effectiveness of conventional topical and systemic drugs, biological therapy, or phototherapy for acute guttate psoriasis or an acute guttate flare of chronic psoriasis.

===Topical agents===
Topical corticosteroid preparations are the most effective agents when used continuously for eight weeks; retinoids and coal tar were found to be of limited benefit and may be no better than placebo. Very potent topical corticosteroids may be helpful in some cases, however, it is suggested to only use them for four weeks at a time and only if other less potent topical treatment options are not working.

Vitamin D analogues (such as paricalcitol, calcipotriol, tacalcitol, and calcitriol) are superior to placebo. Combination therapy with vitamin D and a corticosteroid is superior to either treatment alone and vitamin D is superior to coal tar for chronic plaque psoriasis.

For psoriasis of the scalp, a 2016 review found dual therapy (vitamin D analogs and topical corticosteroids) or corticosteroid monotherapy to be more effective and safer than topical vitamin D analogs alone. Due to their similar safety profiles and minimal benefit of dual therapy over monotherapy, corticosteroid monotherapy appears to be an acceptable treatment for short-term treatment.

Moisturizers and emollients such as mineral oil, petroleum jelly, and decubal (an oil-in-water emollient) were found to increase the clearance of psoriatic plaques. Some emollients are even more effective at clearing psoriatic plaques when combined with phototherapy. Certain emollients, though, have no impact on psoriasis plaque clearance or may even decrease the clearance achieved with phototherapy, e.g. the emollient salicylic acid is structurally similar to para-aminobenzoic acid, commonly found in sunscreen, and is known to interfere with phototherapy in psoriasis. Coconut oil, when used as an emollient in psoriasis, has been found to decrease plaque clearance with phototherapy. Medicated creams and ointments applied directly to psoriatic plaques can help reduce inflammation, remove built-up scale, reduce skin turnover, and clear affected skin of plaques. Ointment and creams containing coal tar, dithranol, corticosteroids (i.e. desoximetasone), fluocinonide, vitamin D3 analogues (for example, calcipotriol), and retinoids are routinely used. (The use of the finger tip unit may be helpful in guiding how much topical treatment to use.)

Vitamin D analogs may be useful with steroids; steroids alone have a higher rate of side effects. Vitamin D analogs may allow lower doses of steroids to be used.

Another topical therapy used to treat psoriasis is a form of balneotherapy, which involves daily baths in saltwater, such as the Dead Sea, combined with sun exposure. This is usually done for four weeks in which exposure time is gradually increased. The primary benefit is attributed to sun exposure and specifically UVB light. This is cost-effective and it has been propagated as an effective way to treat psoriasis without medication. Decreases of PASI scores greater than 75% and remission for several months have commonly been observed. Side effects may be mild such as itchiness, folliculitis, sunburn, poikiloderma, and a theoretical risk of nonmelanoma cancer or melanoma has been suggested. Some studies indicate no increased risk of melanoma in the long term. Data are inconclusive concerning nonmelanoma skin cancer risk, but support the idea that the therapy is associated with an increased risk of benign forms of sun-induced skin damage such as, but not limited to, actinic elastosis or liver spots. Dead Sea balneotherapy is also effective for psoriatic arthritis. Tentative evidence indicates that balneophototherapy, a combination of salt bathes and exposure to ultraviolet B-light (UVB), in chronic plaque psoriasis is better than UVB alone. Glycerin is also an effective treatment for Psoriasis.

===UV phototherapy===
Phototherapy in the form of sunlight has long been used for psoriasis. UVB wavelengths of 311–313 nanometers are most common. These lamps have been developed for this treatment. The exposure time should be controlled to avoid overexposure and burning of the skin. The UVB lamps should have a timer that turns off the lamp when the time ends. The dose is increased in every treatment to let the skin get used to the light. Increased rates of cancer from treatment appear to be small. Narrowband UVB therapy has been demonstrated to have similar efficacy to psoralen and ultraviolet A phototherapy (PUVA). A 2013 meta-analysis found no difference in efficacy between NB-UVB and PUVA in the treatment of psoriasis, but NB-UVB is usually more convenient.
One of the problems with clinical phototherapy is the difficulty many people have gaining access to a facility. Indoor tanning resources are almost ubiquitous today and could be considered as a means for people to get UV exposure when dermatologist-provided phototherapy is not available. Indoor tanning is already used by many people as a treatment for psoriasis; one indoor facility reported that 50% of its clients were using the center for psoriasis treatment; another reported 36% were doing the same thing. However, a concern with the use of commercial tanning is that tanning beds that primarily emit UVA might not effectively treat psoriasis. One study found that plaque psoriasis is responsive to erythemogenic doses of either UVA or UVB, as exposure to either can cause dissipation of psoriatic plaques. It does require more energy to reach erythemogenic dosing with UVA.
UV light therapies all have risks; tanning beds are no exception, being listed by the World Health Organization as carcinogens. Exposure to UV light is known to increase the risks of melanoma and squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas; younger people with psoriasis, particularly those under age 35, are at increased risk from melanoma from UV light treatment. A review of studies recommends that people who are susceptible to skin cancers exercise caution when using UV light therapy as a treatment.

A major mechanism of NB-UVB is the induction of DNA damage in the form of pyrimidine dimers. This type of phototherapy is useful in the treatment of psoriasis because the formation of these dimers interferes with the cell cycle and stops it. The interruption of the cell cycle induced by NB-UVB opposes the characteristic rapid division of skin cells seen in psoriasis. The activity of many types of immune cells found in the skin is also effectively suppressed by NB-UVB phototherapy treatments. The most common short-term side effect of this form of phototherapy is redness of the skin; less common side effects of NB-UVB phototherapy are itching and blistering of the treated skin, irritation of the eyes in the form of conjunctival inflammation or inflammation of the cornea, or cold sores due to reactivation of the herpes simplex virus in the skin surrounding the lips. Eye protection is usually given during phototherapy treatments.

PUVA combines the oral or topical administration of psoralen with exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) light. The mechanism of action of PUVA is unknown but probably involves activation of psoralen by UVA light, which inhibits the abnormally rapid production of the cells in psoriatic skin. There are multiple mechanisms of action associated with PUVA, including effects on the skin&#x27;s immune system. PUVA is associated with nausea, headache, fatigue, burning, and itching. Long-term treatment is associated with squamous cell carcinoma (but not with melanoma). A combination therapy for moderate to severe psoriasis using PUVA plus acitretin resulted in benefit, but acitretin use has been associated with birth defects and liver damage.

===Systemic agents===

Psoriasis resistant to topical treatment and phototherapy may be treated with systemic therapies including medications by mouth or injectable treatments. People undergoing systemic treatment must have regular blood and liver function tests to check for medication toxicities. Pregnancy must be avoided for most of these treatments. The majority of people experience a recurrence of psoriasis after systemic treatment is discontinued.
Non-biologic systemic treatments frequently used for psoriasis include methotrexate, ciclosporin, hydroxycarbamide, fumarates such as dimethyl fumarate, and retinoids. Methotrexate and ciclosporin are medications that suppress the immune system; retinoids are synthetic forms of vitamin A. These agents are also regarded as first-line treatments for psoriatic erythroderma. Oral corticosteroids should not be used as they can severely flare psoriasis upon their discontinuation.
Biologics are manufactured proteins that interrupt the immune process involved in psoriasis. Unlike generalized immunosuppressive medical therapies such as methotrexate, biologics target specific aspects of the immune system contributing to psoriasis. These medications are generally well-tolerated, and limited long-term outcome data have demonstrated biologics to be safe for long-term use in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. However, due to their immunosuppressive actions, biologics have been associated with a small increase in the risk for infection.

Guidelines regard biologics as a third-line treatment for plaque psoriasis following inadequate response to topical treatment, phototherapy, and non-biologic systemic treatments. The safety of biologics during pregnancy has not been assessed. European guidelines recommend avoiding biologics if a pregnancy is planned; anti-TNF therapies such as infliximab are not recommended for use in chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus or individuals infected with HIV.
Several monoclonal antibodies target cytokines, the molecules that cells use to send inflammatory signals to each other. TNF-α is one of the main executor inflammatory cytokines. Four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol) and one recombinant TNF-α decoy receptor, etanercept, have been developed to inhibit TNF-α signaling. Additional monoclonal antibodies, such as ixekizumab, have been developed against pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibit the inflammatory pathway at a different point than the anti-TNF-α antibodies. IL-12 and IL-23 share a common domain, p40, which is the target of the FDA-approved ustekinumab. In 2017 the US FDA approved guselkumab for plaque psoriasis. There have been few studies of the efficacy of anti-TNF medications for psoriasis in children. One randomized control study suggested that 12 weeks of etanercept treatment reduced the extent of psoriasis in children with no lasting adverse effects.
Two medications that target T cells are efalizumab and alefacept. Efalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the CD11a subunit of LFA-1. It also blocks the adhesion molecules on the endothelial cells that line blood vessels, which attract T cells. Efalizumab was voluntarily withdrawn from the European market in February 2009, and from the U.S. market in June 2009, by the manufacturer due to the medication&#x27;s association with cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Alefacept also blocks the molecules that dendritic cells use to communicate with T cells and even causes natural killer cells to kill T cells as a way of controlling inflammation. Apremilast may also be used.

Individuals with psoriasis may develop neutralizing antibodies against monoclonal antibodies. Neutralization occurs when an antidrug antibody prevents a monoclonal antibody such as infliximab from binding antigen in a laboratory test. Specifically, neutralization occurs when the anti-drug antibody binds to infliximab&#x27;s antigen binding site instead of TNF-α. When infliximab no longer binds tumor necrosis factor alpha, it no longer decreases inflammation, and psoriasis may worsen. Neutralizing antibodies have not been reported against etanercept, a biologic medication that is a fusion protein composed of two TNF-α receptors. The lack of neutralizing antibodies against etanercept is probably secondary to the innate presence of the TNF-α receptor, and the development of immune tolerance.

There is strong evidence to indicate that infliximab, bimekizumab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab are the most effective biologics for treating moderate to severe cases of psoriasis. There is also some evidence to support use of secukinumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, certolizumab, and ustekinumab. In general, anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha biologics were found to be more effective than traditional systemic treatments. The immunologic pathways of psoriasis involve Th9, Th17, Th1 lymphocytes, and IL-22. The aforementioned biologic agents hinder different aspects of these pathways.

Another set of treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis are fumaric acid esters (FAE), which may be similar in effectiveness to methotrexate.

Apremilast (Otezla, Celgene) is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of the enzyme phosphodiesterase 4, which plays an important role in chronic inflammation associated with psoriasis.

It has been theorized that antistreptococcal medications may improve guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis; however, limited studies do not show that antibiotics are effective.

===Surgery===
Limited evidence suggests removal of the tonsils may benefit people with chronic plaque psoriasis, guttate psoriasis, and palmoplantar pustulosis.

===Diet===
Uncontrolled studies have suggested that individuals with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis may benefit from a diet supplemented with fish oil rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A low-calorie diet appears to reduce the severity of psoriasis. Diet recommendations include consumption of cold water fish (preferably wild fish, not farmed) such as salmon, herring, and mackerel; extra virgin olive oil; legumes; vegetables; fruits; and whole grains; and avoid consumption of alcohol, red meat, and dairy products (due to their saturated fat). The effect of caffeine consumption (including from coffee, black tea, mate, and dark chocolate) remains to be determined.

Many patients report improvements after consuming less tobacco, caffeine, sugar, nightshades (tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, paprika and white potatoes) and taking probiotics and oral Vitamin D.

There is a higher rate of celiac disease among people with psoriasis. When adopting a gluten-free diet, disease severity generally decreases in people with celiac disease and those with anti-gliadin antibodies.

==Prognosis==
Most people with psoriasis experience nothing more than mild skin lesions that can be treated effectively with topical therapies. Depending on the severity and location of outbreaks, people may experience significant physical discomfort and some disability, affecting the person&#x27;s quality of life. Itching and pain can interfere with basic functions, such as self-care and sleep. Participation in sporting activities, certain occupations, and caring for family members can become difficult activities for those with plaques located on their hands and feet. Plaques on the scalp can be particularly embarrassing, as flaky plaque in the hair can be mistaken for dandruff.
[[Women in the Philippines|Filipina]] with psoriasis
Individuals with psoriasis may feel self-conscious about their appearance and have a poor self-image that stems from fear of public rejection and psychosexual concerns. Psoriasis has been associated with low self-esteem and depression is more common among those with the condition. People with psoriasis often feel prejudiced against due to the commonly held incorrect belief that psoriasis is contagious. Psychological distress can lead to significant depression and social isolation; a high rate of thoughts about suicide has been associated with psoriasis. Many tools exist to measure the quality of life of people with psoriasis and other dermatological disorders. Clinical research has indicated individuals often experience a diminished quality of life. Children with psoriasis may encounter bullying.

Several conditions are associated with psoriasis including obesity, cardiovascular, and metabolic disturbances. These occur more frequently in older people. Nearly half of individuals with psoriasis over the age of 65 have at least three comorbidities (concurrent conditions), and two-thirds have at least two comorbidities.

===Cardiovascular disease===
Psoriasis has been associated with obesity and several other cardiovascular and metabolic disturbances. The number of new cases per year of diabetes is 27% higher in people affected by psoriasis than in those without the condition. Severe psoriasis may be even more strongly associated with the development of diabetes than mild psoriasis. Younger people with psoriasis may also be at increased risk for developing diabetes. Individuals with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis have a slightly higher risk of heart disease and heart attacks when compared to the general population. Cardiovascular disease risk appeared to be correlated with the severity of psoriasis and its duration. There is no strong evidence to suggest that psoriasis is associated with an increased risk of death from cardiovascular events. Methotrexate may provide a degree of protection for the heart.

The odds of having hypertension are 1.58 times higher in people with psoriasis than those without the condition; these odds are even higher with severe cases of psoriasis. A similar association was noted in people who have psoriatic arthritis—the odds of having hypertension were found to be 2.07 times greater when compared to odds of the general population. The link between psoriasis and hypertension is not currently understood. Mechanisms hypothesized to be involved in this relationship include the following: dysregulation of the renin–angiotensin system, elevated levels of endothelin 1 in the blood, and increased oxidative stress. The number of new cases of the heart rhythm abnormality atrial fibrillation is 1.31 times higher in people with mild psoriasis and 1.63 times higher in people with severe psoriasis. There may be a slightly increased risk of stroke associated with psoriasis, especially in severe cases. Treating high levels of cholesterol with statins has been associated with decreased psoriasis severity, as measured by PASI score, and has also been associated with improvements in other cardiovascular disease risk factors such as markers of inflammation. These cardioprotective effects are attributed to ability of statins to improve blood lipid profile and because of their anti-inflammatory effects. Statin use in those with psoriasis and hyperlipidemia was associated with decreased levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and TNFα as well as decreased activity of the immune protein LFA-1. Compared to individuals without psoriasis, those affected by psoriasis are more likely to satisfy the criteria for metabolic syndrome.

===Other diseases===
The rates of Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis are increased when compared with the general population, by a factor of 3.8 and 7.5 respectively. People with psoriasis also have a higher risk of celiac disease. Few studies have evaluated the association of multiple sclerosis with psoriasis, and the relationship has been questioned. Psoriasis has been associated with a 16% increase in overall relative risk for non-skin cancer, thought to be attributed to systemic therapy, particularly methotrexate. People treated with long-term systemic therapy for psoriasis have a 52% increased risk cancers of the lung and bronchus, a 205% increase in the risk of developing cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract, a 31% increase in the risk of developing cancers of the urinary tract, a 90% increase in the risk of developing liver cancer, and a 46% increase in the risk of developing pancreatic cancer. The risk for development of non-melanoma skin cancers is also increased. Psoriasis increases the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the skin by 431% and increases the risk of basal cell carcinoma by 100%. There is no increased risk of melanoma associated with psoriasis. People with psoriasis have a higher risk of developing cancer.

==Epidemiology==
Psoriasis is estimated to affect 2–4% of the population of the western world. The rate of psoriasis varies according to age, region and ethnicity; a combination of environmental and genetic factors is thought to be responsible for these differences. Psoriasis is about five times more common in people of European descent than in people of Asian descent, more common in countries farther from the equator, relatively uncommon in African Americans, and extremely uncommon in Native Americans. Psoriasis has been estimated to affect about 6.7million Americans.

Psoriasis can occur at any age, although it is more frequent in adults and commonly appears for the first time between the ages of 15 and 25 years. Approximately one-third of people with psoriasis report being diagnosed before age 20. Psoriasis affects both sexes equally.

People with inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn&#x27;s disease or ulcerative colitis are at an increased risk of developing psoriasis.

==History==
Scholars believe psoriasis to have been included among the various skin conditions called &quot;tzaraath&quot; (translated as leprosy) in the Hebrew Bible. The person was deemed &quot;impure&quot; (see tumah and taharah) during their affected phase and is ultimately treated by the kohen. However, it is more likely that this confusion arose from the use of the same Greek term for both conditions. The Greeks used the term () for scaly skin conditions. They used the term () to describe itchy skin conditions. It became known as &quot;Willan&#x27;s lepra&quot; in the late 18th century when English dermatologists Robert Willan and Thomas Bateman differentiated it from other skin diseases. Leprosy, they said, is distinguished by the regular, circular form of patches, while psoriasis is always irregular. Willan identified two categories: and .

Psoriasis is thought to have first been described in Ancient Rome by Cornelius Celsus. The British dermatologist Thomas Bateman described a possible link between psoriasis and arthritic symptoms in 1813. Admiral William Halsey missed out on the Battle of Midway because he contracted psoriasis while out at sea in the early months of American participation of World War II. Admiral Chester Nimitz medically ordered Halsey to recover at a hospital in Hawaii.

The history of psoriasis is littered with treatments of dubious effectiveness and high toxicity. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Fowler&#x27;s solution, which contains a poisonous and carcinogenic arsenic compound, was used by dermatologists as a treatment for psoriasis. Mercury was also used for psoriasis treatment during this time. Sulfur, iodine, and phenol were also commonly used treatments for psoriasis during this era when it was incorrectly believed that psoriasis was an infectious disease. Coal tars were widely used with ultraviolet light irradiation as a topical treatment approach in the early 1900s. During the same time, psoriatic arthritis cases were treated with intravenously administered gold preparations in the same manner as rheumatoid arthritis.

== Society and culture ==
The International Federation of Psoriasis Associations (IFPA) is the global umbrella organization for national and regional psoriasis associations and also gathers the leading experts in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis research for scientific conferences every three years. The Psoriasis International Network, a program of the Fondation René Touraine, gathers dermatologists, rheumatologists, and other caregivers involved in the management of psoriasis. Non-profit organizations like the National Psoriasis Foundation in the United States, the Psoriasis Association in the United Kingdom, and Psoriasis Australia offer advocacy and education about psoriasis in their respective countries.

===Cost===
The annual cost of treating psoriasis in the United States is estimated as high as $32.5billion, including $12.2billion in direct costs. Pharmacy costs are the main source of direct expense, with biologic therapy the most prevalent. These costs increase significantly when co-morbid conditions such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, lung disease, and psychiatric disorders are factored in. Expenses linked to co-morbidities are estimated at an additional $23,000 per person per year.

==Research==
The role of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of psoriasis is under investigation. Preliminary research has suggested that antioxidants such as polyphenols may have beneficial effects on the inflammation characteristic of psoriasis.

Many novel medications being researched during the 2010s target the Th17/IL-23 axis, particularly IL-23p19 inhibitors, as IL-23p19 is present in increased concentrations in psoriasis skin lesions while contributing less to protection against opportunistic infections. Other cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-22 also have been targets for inhibition as they play important roles in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Another avenue of research has focused on the use of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors to treat psoriasis. Oral agents being investigated during the 2010s as alternatives to medications administered by injection include Janus kinase inhibitors, protein kinase C inhibitors, mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors, and phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, all of which have proven effective in various phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. These agents have potentially severe side-effects due to their immunosuppressive mechanisms.

<text>Sixto Escobar (March 23, 1913 – November 17, 1979) was a Puerto Rican professional boxer. Competing in the bantamweight division, he became Puerto Rico&#x27;s first world champion.

Escobar was born in Barceloneta and raised in San Juan. There he received his primary education and took interest in boxing. After gathering a record of 21–1–1 as an amateur, Escobar debuted as a professional in 1931 defeating Luis &quot;Kid Dominican&quot; Pérez by knockout. Early in his career, he moved to Venezuela due to the lack of opponents in his division. There he received an opportunity for the Venezuelan Bantamweight championship, but lost by points to Enrique Chaffardet. Subsequently, he moved to New York and began boxing in other states, eventually capturing the Montreal Athletic Commission World Bantamweight Title. In 1936, he defeated Tony Marino to unify this championship with the one recognized by the International Boxing Union, in the process becoming the third Latin American undisputed world boxing champion. After retiring, he worked as a spokesperson for beer companies in New York, before returning to Puerto Rico in the 1960s, where he resided until his death. He received several posthumous recognitions and his name was used in several sports venues and buildings. In 2002, Escobar was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Early life and amateur career==
Escobar was born in La Boca in Barrio Palmas Altas, a sector of Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, to Jacinto Escobar and Adela Vargas. Early in his life, he moved to Tras Talleres in Santurce, a subsection of San Juan, Puerto Rico. There he received his elementary and secondary education, up until the seventh grade, when he decided to dedicate himself full-time to his sports career. In Tras Talleres, he began developing an interest in boxing and received instruction in said discipline. Although at this time, boxing was illegal in Puerto Rico; remote places such as a house&#x27;s backyard or rooftops were used to organize clandestine fights without attracting attention from the local police. In 1928, a Puerto Rican boxer named Ángel &quot;Sotito&quot; Soto moved from New York to a house near the Escobar family&#x27;s residence and established a gym in his backyard. There he gave boxing classes to Escobar and several other young athletes. After several months of instruction, Soto prepared a boxing card with included three-round fights, in which each round lasted two minutes. In this event, Escobar earned his first victory, defeating a pugilist identified as &quot;Gombar&quot; by knockout in the first round. After this match, Escobar continued fighting in clandestine gyms. He met and was received by Ignacio Peñagaricano, the owner of Victoria Gym. Escobar received his boxing license through Peñagaricano. On February 16, 1927, governor Horace Mann Towner legalized boxing and allowed the establishment of organized boxing matches. Professionals would fight Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays which, were considered the best days of the week, while amateurs could compete the remaining days of the week without limitations. As an amateur, he fought in 23 combats, gathering a record of 21 wins, one loss and a draw. His draw was against Ramón Rodríguez of San Lorenzo and his only loss was in the hands of Pedro Montañez from Cayey, in a fight that took place in March 1930.

==Professional career==
Escobar turned professional on September 1, 1930, in a fight card organized at the Victory Garden gym in San Juan. In this event, he defeated Luis &quot;Kid Dominican&quot; Pérez, who entered the fight as the Dominican Republic&#x27;s champion, by knockout in the third round. In Puerto Rico, Escobar fought in 15 contests, before moving to Venezuela after the popularity of professional boxing declined in his home country. This move was motivated by Roberto Andrade, who provided transportation to the country. In Venezuela, he fought in Caracas, competing against José Lugo, Sindulfo Díaz, Rafael &quot;Moralito&quot; Morales, Pica Pica and Simón Chávez among others. On November 11, 1931, Escobar competed against Enrique Chaffardet for the Venezuelan Bantamweight Title, but lost by decision. After 17 fights, he returned to Puerto Rico and competed in five cards. But professional boxing suffered another decline in interest, which forced Escobar to work as an accommodator in baseball games three days of the week, generally on weekends. In the meanwhile, Tony Rojas, a friend of his managers Gustavo Jiménez and Arturo Gigante, convinced them to release Escobar of the contract which bound them. Since Escobar turned professional while he was still legally a minor, his father had to sign the unbinding agreement. After succeeding in this task, Rojas presented Escobar with a steam boat ticket to New York, which covered his food, clothes and hotel expenses. Escobar reached New York in early 1934, intending to &quot;obtain fame and honor&quot; for &quot;[his] motherland&quot;, there he was received by Rojas and professional trainer Whitey Bimstein. His first fight in the United States took place at the Valley Arena in Holyoke, Massachusetts on May 7, 1934. In this contest he was paired against Canadian bantamweight titleholder Bobby Leitham, defeating him by technical knockout in the seventh round.

Escobar&#x27;s manager, Lou Brix and his trainer recognized that Escobar could be close to a championship fight once the incumbent, Panamian Alfonso Teófilo Brown, refused to defend the championship against the first contender, which led to it being stripped by the National Boxing Association (NBA). A rematch was then organized against Leitham. This was an eliminatory card organized by the Montreal Athletic Commission, which was to determine a contender for their vacant Bantamweight World Championship, against first contender Baby Casanova, who attended the card. After scoring three knockdowns in the fourth round, Escobar connected another punch that injured Leitham, after which Leitham&#x27;s manager surrendered the fight. This marked Leitham&#x27;s last fight. Following this result, the NBA immediately called for a fight between Escobar and Casanova. By this time he had gained a reputation as a quick and technical boxer, capable of gathering quick knockouts with body punches if confronted by an unprepared opponent. The fight took place on June 26, 1934, and it was organized in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Escobar scored a knockdown in the third round; the fight concluded in the ninth round when Casanova lost by knockout. With this win, Escobar won the Montreal Athletic Commission World Bantamweight Title, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican to win a world boxing championship title. This had a significant impact on Puerto Rico, where it was constantly discussed by the general public. Songs, decimas and poetry were written about this accomplishment. However, the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) and International Boxing Union (IBU) of France didn&#x27;t recognize the outcome of this fight, conserving Tony Marino and Brown as their recognized champions.

===Undisputed world bantamweight title===
On August 8, 1934, he defeated Eugene Hart by points in a non-title match organized in Canada. This was the first time in his career that Escobar completed a 15-round contest. After this event, he stayed in Montreal expecting to fight against the winner of a matchup between Louis Salica and Bobby Quintana, which was scheduled to take place on December of that year. However, Escobar was forced to cancel his plans after suffering a heel injury when he was hit by a car. He spent a month in inactivity while recovering, and in the winter he returned to Puerto Rico. The governor ordered to have all government buildings closed so that public employees could attend a welcoming ceremony. The event, which took place in Old San Juan&#x27;s dock, was followed by a parade. Upon arriving in Barceloneta, Escobar was recognized as a &quot;predilect son&quot; of that municipality by the city&#x27;s mayor, which was followed by a week of festivities in his name. Escobar pursued a fight with Brown, but his offers were refused while the Panamanian pugilist promoted a campaign protesting the removal of his recognition as champion, demanding to be reinstated.

On August 7, 1935, Escobar defeated Pete Sanstol—who once held, in 1931, the Canadian Boxing Federation and Montreal Athletic Commission (MAC) world bantamweight titles—by unanimous decision in 12 rounds. However, Escobar still wasn&#x27;t considered the division&#x27;s Undisputed Champion because Balthazar Sangchili had defeated Panama Al Brown and was recognized by the IBU. Due to this, Sanstol sent a letter to the NYSAC noting that the fight was of eliminatory nature, even though it was recognized as a titular contest by the NBA and MAC. Wanting to be recognized as such, Escobar pursued a title unification fight against Tony Marino, who had defeated Sangchili by knockout in his previous fight. He won the fight by knockout in the tenth round, receiving the &quot;undisputed world champion&quot; 
distinction. On November 13, 1935, Escobar became the first Puerto Rican to win a title fight in the first round, defeating &quot;Indian&quot; Quintana by knockout.

This outcome made it possible to organize a fight against Louis Salica, it was the first time that Escobar fought a title fight in Puerto Rico. The card was promoted by Arturo Gigante and Gustavo Jiménez Sicardó. Escobar won the fight by unanimous decision, while Jack Dempsey served as referee. He participated in Mike Jacobs&#x27;s &quot;Carnival of Champions&quot; on September 23, 1937 and lost the title to Harry Jeffra by unanimous decision. Shortly after, he recovered from this loss and he returned to the gym; he defeated Johnny Defoe in a preparatory contest. On February 20, 1938, Escobar faced Jeffra in a rematch organized at the &quot;El Escambrón&quot; baseball park in Puerta de Tierra. He won the contest by unanimous decision, scoring three knockdowns. This became an early example of fights that attracted the attention and criticism of boxing analysts, particularly those in New York. On April 2, 1939, Escobar defeated Kayo Morgan before a sold-out crowd of 15,000 at the &quot;Estadio Sixto Escobar&quot;, which had been inaugurated three years earlier. After this fight, he received &quot;The Ring&quot; Bantamweight Championship, which was presented by the magazine&#x27;s editor, Nat Fleischer. Later in 1939, Escobar received a draft notice from the United States Army, ordering him to take a physical exam for possible military service. He and his manager presented the issue to the Puerto Rico Boxing Commission, managing to receive a postponement of two months before surrendering his title. On April 6, 1940, Escobar fought Simón Chávez for ten rounds in what ended as a draw. Escobar then fought some short non-title fights, of which he lost four, all by points. On December 2, 1940, Escobar participated in his last professional fight, losing to a ten-round decision to Harry Jeffra. Throughout his career Escobar avoided being knocked down or out in any fight, all of his losses being by decision. In April 1941, he was drafted to the United States Army and participated in World War II.

==Retirement, death and legacy==

After his military service, Escobar confronted problems to meet the bantamweight&#x27;s limit and retired. He became a spokesman for a liquor brand and relocated to New York temporally, with his family. Subsequently, he returned to Puerto Rico where he worked selling liquor in bars. In May 1947, Escobar and Jiménez Sicardó co-promoted a fight with the intention of bringing fans back to boxing. In the main event, Diego Sosa was matched against Francisco Colón García. Escobar was inducted into the Madison Square Garden&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame in 1950. Escobar continued in his job as a liquor salesperson, during which it was common for liquor salesmen to drink a little bit of the product which they sold in front of potential customers. This contributed to the development of Escobar&#x27;s alcoholic tendencies. His alcoholism would later combine with his diabetes and contribute to his death when he was 66 years old. Weeks before his death, Escobar participated in his last ceremony, where Diego Suárez, president of V. Suárez &amp; Company. gave him a recognition.

After his death, the town of Barceloneta honored his memory by a statue. His remains are interred at Cementerio Municipal Viejo in Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, according to a memorial written to honor his life. Escobar became the first world boxing champion in history to have a statue in his honor. On June 9, 2002, Escobar was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. He became the fourth Puerto Rican to receive this distinction and the first to be included in the &quot;Old Timers&quot; section. In March 2005, a second statue of Estobar was unveiled at the Estadio Sixto Escobar in San Juan. Among the celebrities that attended the ceremony were former boxing world champions Julian Solís and Alfredo Escalera. This statue&#x27;s location served as a remembrance tribute during the 94th anniversary of Escobar&#x27;s birth, when a flower crown was placed at its feet. During this date, an activity was presented by Puerto Rico&#x27;s House of Boxing in the library of the &quot;Pabellón de la Fama del Deporte Puertorriqueño&quot;. Among those who attended the ceremony were Solís, Escalera and Iván Calderón. On this date, People Inc. presented a documentary covering his life, which was donated to the venue. Several buildings and streets were named after Escobar posthumously, including the &quot;Auditorio Sixto Escobar&quot;. The house where he lived was later turned into a library and museum bearing his name.

In 2019 Sixto Escobar was posthumously inducted to the Puerto Rico Veterans Hall of Fame.

<doc id="101970" wikidata="Q192309" url="?curid=101970" title="Tinnitus">
<text>Tinnitus is a condition when a person hears a ringing sound or a different variety of sound when no corresponding external sound is present and other people cannot hear it. Nearly everyone experiences faint &quot;normal tinnitus&quot; in a completely quiet room; but this is of concern only if it is bothersome, interferes with normal hearing, or is associated with other problems. The word &quot;tinnitus&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;&quot;, &quot;to ring&quot;. In some people, it interferes with concentration, and can be associated with anxiety and depression.


Tinnitus is usually associated with hearing loss and decreased comprehension of speech in noisy environments. It is common, affecting about 10–15% of people. Most tolerate it well, and it is a significant problem in only 1–2% of people. It can trigger a fight-or-flight response, as the brain may perceive it as dangerous and important.
Rather than a disease, tinnitus is a symptom that may result from a variety of underlying causes and may be generated at any level of the auditory system as well as outside that system. The most common causes are hearing damage, noise-induced hearing loss, or age-related hearing loss, known as presbycusis. Other causes include ear infections, disease of the heart or blood vessels, Ménière&#x27;s disease, brain tumors, acoustic neuromas (tumors on the auditory nerves of the ear), migraines, temporomandibular joint disorders, exposure to certain medications, a previous head injury, and earwax. It can suddenly emerge during a period of emotional stress. It is more common in those with depression.
The diagnosis of tinnitus is usually based on a patient&#x27;s description of the symptoms they are experiencing. Such a diagnosis is commonly supported by an audiogram, and an otolaryngological and neurological examination. How much tinnitus interferes with a person&#x27;s life may be quantified with questionnaires. If certain problems are found, medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be performed. Other tests are suitable when tinnitus occurs with the same rhythm as the heartbeat. Rarely, the sound may be heard by someone other than the patient by using a stethoscope, in which case it is known as &quot;objective tinnitus&quot;. Occasionally, spontaneous otoacoustic emissions, sounds produced normally by the inner ear, may result in tinnitus.
Measures to prevent tinnitus include avoiding chronic or extended exposure to loud noise, and limiting exposure to drugs and substances harmful to the ear (ototoxic). If there is an underlying cause, treating that cause may lead to improvements. Otherwise, typically, tinnitus management involves psychoeducation or counseling, such as talk therapy. Sound generators or hearing aids may help. No medication directly targets tinnitus.

==Signs and symptoms==

Tinnitus is often described as ringing, but it may also sound like clicking, buzzing, hissing, or roaring. It may be soft or loud, low- or high-pitched, and may seem to come from either one or both ears, or from the head itself. It may be intermittent or continuous. In some individuals, its intensity may be changed by shoulder, neck, head, tongue, jaw, or eye movements.

Due to variations in study designs, data on the course of tinnitus shows few consistent results. Generally, prevalence increases with age in adults, and the ratings of annoyance increase with persistence at follow up.

===Psychological effects===
Although it is an annoying condition to which most people adapt, persistent tinnitus may cause anxiety and depression in some people. Tinnitus annoyance is more strongly associated with the psychological condition of the person than the loudness or frequency range of the perceived sound. Psychological problems such as depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and concentration difficulties are common in those with strongly annoying tinnitus. 45% of people with tinnitus have an anxiety disorder at some time in their lives.

Psychological research has focused on the tinnitus distress reaction to account for differences in tinnitus severity. The research indicates that conditioning at the initial perception of tinnitus linked it with negative emotions, such as fear and anxiety.

==Types==
Commonly tinnitus is classified into &quot;subjective and objective tinnitus&quot;. Tinnitus is usually subjective, meaning that the sounds the person hears are not detectable by means currently available to physicians and hearing technicians. Subjective tinnitus has also been called &quot;tinnitus aurium&quot;, &quot;non-auditory&quot;, or &quot;non-vibratory&quot; tinnitus. In rare cases, tinnitus can be heard by someone else using a stethoscope. Even more rarely, in some cases it can be measured as a spontaneous otoacoustic emission (SOAE) in the ear canal. This is classified as objective tinnitus, also called &quot;pseudo-tinnitus&quot; or &quot;vibratory&quot; tinnitus.

===Subjective tinnitus===
Subjective tinnitus is the most frequent type. It can have many causes, but most commonly it results from hearing loss. When it is caused by disorders of the inner ear or auditory nerve, it can be called &quot;otic&quot; (from the Greek word for ear). These otological or neurological disorders include those triggered by infections, drugs, or trauma. A cause is traumatic noise exposure that damages hair cells in the inner ear. Some evidence suggests that long-term exposure to noise pollution from heavy traffic may increase the risk of developing tinnitus.

When there does not seem to be a connection with a disorder of the inner ear or auditory nerve, tinnitus can be called &quot;non-otic&quot;. In 30% of cases, tinnitus is influenced by the somatosensory system; for instance, people can increase or decrease their tinnitus by moving their face, head, jaw, or neck. This type is called somatic or craniocervical tinnitus, since it is only head or neck movements that have an effect.

Some tinnitus may be caused by neuroplastic changes in the central auditory pathway. In this theory, the disturbance of sensory input caused by hearing loss results in such changes as a homeostatic response of neurons in the central auditory system, causing tinnitus. When some frequencies of sound are lost to hearing loss, the auditory system compensates by amplifying those frequencies, eventually producing sound sensations at those frequencies constantly even when there is no corresponding external sound.

====Hearing loss====
The most common cause of tinnitus is hearing loss. Hearing loss may have many different causes, but among those with tinnitus, the major cause is cochlear injury.

In many cases no underlying cause is identified.

Ototoxic drugs also may cause subjective tinnitus, as they may cause hearing loss, or increase the damage done by exposure to loud noise. This damage may occur even at doses not considered ototoxic. More than 260 medications have been reported to cause tinnitus as a side effect.

Tinnitus can also occur from the discontinuation of therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines. It can sometimes be a protracted symptom of benzodiazepine withdrawal and may persist for many months. Medications such as bupropion may also cause tinnitus.

==== Associated factors ====
Factors associated with tinnitus include:
* Ear problems and hearing loss:
** Conductive hearing loss
*** Acoustic shock

*** Middle ear effusion
*** Otitis
*** Otosclerosis
*** Eustachian tube dysfunction
** Sensorineural hearing loss

*** 5-MeO-DET
*** Diisopropyltryptamine (DiPT)
** Benzodiazepine withdrawal
** Intracranial hyper or hypotension caused by, for example, encephalitis or a cerebrospinal fluid leak

===Objective tinnitus===
A specific type of tinnitus, &quot;objective tinnitus&quot;, is characterized by hearing the sounds of one&#x27;s own muscle contractions or pulse, typically a result of sounds that have been created by the movement of jaw muscles or sounds related to blood flow in the neck or face. It is sometimes caused by an involuntary twitching of a muscle or a group of muscles (myoclonus) or by a vascular condition. In some cases, tinnitus is generated by muscle spasms around the middle ear.

Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs)—faint high-frequency tones that are produced in the inner ear and can be measured in the ear canal with a sensitive microphone—may also cause tinnitus. About 8% of those with SOAEs and tinnitus have SOAE-linked tinnitus, while the percentage of all cases of tinnitus caused by SOAEs is estimated at 4%.

===Pediatric tinnitus===
Children may be subject to pulsatile or continuous tinnitus, involving anomalies and variants of the vascular parts affecting the middle/inner ear structures. CT scans may be used to check the integrity of the structures, and MR scans can evaluate nerves and potential masses or malformations. Early diagnosis can prevent long-term impairments to development.

=== Pulsatile tinnitus ===
Some people experience a sound that beats in time with their pulse, known as &quot;pulsatile tinnitus&quot; or &quot;vascular tinnitus&quot;. Pulsatile tinnitus is usually objective in nature, resulting from altered blood flow or increased blood turbulence near the ear, such as from atherosclerosis or venous hum, but it can also arise as a subjective phenomenon from an increased awareness of blood flow in the ear.

The differential diagnosis for pulsatile tinnitus is wide and includes vascular etiologies, tumors, disorders of the middle ear or inner ear, and other intracranial pathologies. Vascular causes of pulsatile tinnitus include venous causes (e.g., high riding or dehiscent jugular bulb, sigmoid sinus diverticulum), arterial causes (e.g., cervical atherosclerosis, potentially life-threatening conditions such as carotid artery aneurysm or carotid artery dissection), or dural arteriovenous fistula or arteriovenous malformations. 

Pulsatile tinnitus may also indicate vasculitis, or more specifically, giant cell arteritis. Pulsatile tinnitus may also be caused by tumors such as paragangliomas (e.g., glomus tympanicum, glomus jugulare) or hemangiomas (e.g., facial nerve or cavernous). Middle ear causes of pulsatile tinnitus include patulous eustachian tube, otosclerosis, or middle ear myoclonus (e.g., stapedial or tensor tympani myoclonus). The most common inner ear cause of pulsatile tinnitus is superior semicircular canal dehiscence. Pulsatile tinnitus may also indicate idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Pulsatile tinnitus can be a symptom of intracranial vascular abnormalities and should be evaluated for &quot;irregular noises of blood flow&quot; (bruits).

==Pathophysiology==
Tinnitus may be caused by increased neural activity in the auditory brainstem, where the brain processes sounds, causing some auditory nerve cells to become overexcited. The basis of this theory is that many with tinnitus also have hearing loss.

Three reviews in 2016 emphasized the large range and possible combinations of pathologies involved in tinnitus, which result in a great variety of symptoms and specifically adapted therapies.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnostic approach is based on a history of the condition and an examination of the head, neck, and neurological system. Typically an audiogram is done, and occasionally medical imaging or electronystagmography. Treatable conditions may include middle ear infection, acoustic neuroma,
concussion, and otosclerosis.

Evaluation of tinnitus can include a hearing test (audiogram), measurement of acoustic parameters of the tinnitus like pitch and loudness, and psychological assessment of comorbid conditions like depression, anxiety, and stress that are associated with severity of the tinnitus.

One definition of tinnitus, in contrast to normal ear noise experience, is that tinnitus lasts five minutes at least twice a week. However, people with tinnitus often experience the noise more frequently than this. Tinnitus can be present constantly or intermittently. Some people with constant tinnitus might not be aware of it all the time, but only, for example, during the night when there is less environmental noise to mask it. Chronic tinnitus can be defined as tinnitus with a duration of six months or more.

===Audiology===
Since most people with tinnitus also have hearing loss, a pure tone hearing test resulting in an audiogram may help diagnose a cause. An audiogram may also facilitate fitting of a hearing aid in those cases where hearing loss is significant. The pitch of tinnitus is often in the range of the hearing loss.

===Psychoacoustics===
Acoustic qualification of tinnitus includes measurement of several acoustic parameters like frequency in cases of monotone tinnitus or , loudness in dB above hearing threshold at the indicated frequency, , and minimum masking level. In most cases, tinnitus pitch or frequency range is between 5 kHz and 10 kHz, and loudness between 5 and 15 dB above the hearing threshold.

Another relevant parameter of tinnitus is residual inhibition: the temporary suppression or disappearance of tinnitus following a period of masking. The degree of residual inhibition may indicate how effective tinnitus maskers would be as treatment.

An assessment of hyperacusis, a frequent accompaniment of tinnitus, may also be made. Hyperacusis is related to negative reactions to sound and can take many forms. One parameter that can be measured is Loudness Discomfort Level (LDL) in dB, the subjective level of acute discomfort at specified frequencies over the frequency range of hearing. This defines a dynamic range between the hearing threshold at that frequency and the loudness discomfort level. A compressed dynamic range over a particular frequency range can be associated with hyperacusis. Normal hearing threshold is generally defined as 0–20 decibels (dB). Normal loudness discomfort levels are 85–90+ dB, with some authorities citing 100 dB. A dynamic range of 55 dB or less is indicative of hyperacusis.

===Severity===
Tinnitus is often rated on a scale from &quot;slight&quot; to &quot;severe&quot; according to the effects it has, such as interference with sleep, quiet activities, and normal daily activities.

Assessment of psychological processes related to tinnitus involves measurement of tinnitus severity and distress, as measured subjectively by validated self-report tinnitus questionnaires. Such questionnaires measure the degree of psychological distress and handicap associated with tinnitus, including effects on hearing, lifestyle, health, and emotional functioning. A broader assessment of general functioning, such as levels of anxiety, depression, stress, life stressors, and sleep difficulties, is also important in the assessment of tinnitus due to higher risk of negative well-being across these areas, which may be affected by or exacerbate the tinnitus symptoms. 

Current assessment measures aim to identify levels of distress and interference, coping responses, and perceptions of tinnitus to inform treatment and monitor progress. However, wide variability, inconsistencies, and lack of consensus regarding assessment methodology are evidenced in the literature, limiting comparison of treatment effectiveness. Developed to guide diagnosis or classify severity, most tinnitus questionnaires have been shown to be treatment-sensitive outcome measures.

===Pulsatile tinnitus===
If examination reveals a bruit (sound due to turbulent blood flow), imaging studies such as transcranial doppler (TCD) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) should be performed.

===Differential diagnosis===
Other potential sources of the sounds normally associated with tinnitus should be ruled out. For instance, two recognized sources of high-pitched sounds might be electromagnetic fields common in modern wiring and various sound signal transmissions. A common and often misdiagnosed condition that mimics tinnitus is radio frequency (RF) hearing, in which subjects hear objectively audible high-pitched transmission frequencies that sound similar to tinnitus.

==Prevention==

Prolonged exposure to loud sound or noise levels can lead to tinnitus. Custom made ear plugs or other measures can help with prevention. Employers may use hearing loss prevention programs to help educate and prevent dangerous levels of exposure to noise. Government organizations set regulations to ensure employees, if following the protocol, should have minimal risk to permanent damage to their hearing.

Certain groups are advised to wear ear plugs to avoid the risk of tinnitus, such as that caused by overexposure to loud noises like wind noise for motorcycle riders. This includes military personnel, musicians, DJs, agricultural workers, and construction workers as people in those occupations are at a greater risk compared to the general population.

Several medicines have ototoxic effects, which can have a cumulative effect that increases the damage done by noise. If ototoxic medications must be administered, close attention by the physician to prescription details, such as dose and dosage interval, can reduce the damage done.

==Management==
If a specific underlying cause is determined, treating it may lead to improvements. Otherwise, the primary treatment for tinnitus is talk therapy, sound therapy, or hearing aids. There are no effective drugs that treat tinnitus.

===Psychological===
The best-supported treatment for tinnitus is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). It decreases the stress those with tinnitus feel. This appears to be independent of any effect on depression or anxiety. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) also shows promise in the treatment of tinnitus. Relaxation techniques may also help. A clinical protocol called Progressive Tinnitus Management has been developed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

===Sound-based interventions===
The application of sound therapy by either hearing aids or tinnitus maskers may help the brain ignore the specific tinnitus frequency. Although these methods are poorly supported by evidence, there are no negative effects. There are several approaches for tinnitus sound therapy. The first is sound modification to compensate for the individual&#x27;s hearing loss. The second is tailored music therapy, notched at the tinnitus frequency, which may affect lateral inhibition of the notched neural region, suppressing tinnitus. 

There is some tentative evidence supporting tinnitus retraining therapy, which aims to reduce tinnitus-related neuronal activity. An alternative tinnitus treatment uses mobile applications that include various methods including masking, sound therapy, and relaxation exercises. Such applications can work as a separate device or as a hearing aid control system.

Neuromonics is another sound-based intervention. Its protocol follows the principle of systematic desensitization and involves a structured rehabilitation program lasting 12 months. Neuromonics therapy employs customized sound signals delivered through a device worn by the patient, which aims to target the specific frequency range associated with their tinnitus perception.

=== Physical therapy ===
Physical therapy for tinnitus focuses on relaxing jaw and neck muscles that may contribute to symptoms. Muscle tension, particularly in the jaw muscles like the masseter and medial pterygoid, can radiate to the ears, leading to somatic tinnitus. Specialized physical therapists use neuromuscular techniques to alleviate tension in these areas, which may reduce tinnitus intensity and associated pain in connected areas, such as the jaw, teeth, and ears.

===Medications===
 there were no medications effective for idiopathic tinnitus. There is not enough evidence to determine if antidepressants or acamprosate are useful. There are conflicting studies regarding the effectiveness of benzodiazepines for tinnitus. The usefulness of melatonin, as of 2015, is unclear. It is unclear if anticonvulsants are useful for treating tinnitus. Steroid injections into the middle ear also do not seem to be effective. There is no evidence to suggest that the use of betahistine to treat tinnitus is effective.

Botulinum toxin injection has succeeded in some of the rare cases of objective tinnitus from a palatal tremor.

Caroverine is used in a few countries to treat tinnitus. The evidence for its usefulness is very weak.

===Neuromodulation===
In 2020, information about clinical trials indicated that bimodal neuromodulation may reduce the symptoms of tinnitus. It is a noninvasive technique that involves applying an electrical stimulus to the tongue while also administering sounds. Equipment associated with the treatments is available through physicians. Studies with it and similar devices continue in several research centers.

In March 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Neuromod&#x27;s Lenire device as a treatment option for tinnitus. In June 2024, the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced it would begin offering the treatment to veterans with tinnitus, making it the first bimodal neuromodulation device to be awarded a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract from the US Government.

Some evidence supports neuromodulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and neurofeedback.

===Alternative medicine===
&quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; does not appear to be effective. The American Academy of Otolaryngology recommends against taking melatonin or zinc supplements to relieve symptoms of tinnitus, and reported that evidence for the efficacy of many dietary supplements (such as lipoflavonoids, garlic, traditional Chinese/Korean herbal medicine, honeybee larvae, and various other vitamins and minerals, as well as homeopathic preparations) did not exist. A 2016 Cochrane Review also concluded that evidence was not sufficient to support taking zinc supplements to reduce symptoms associated with tinnitus.

==Prognosis==
While there is no cure, most people with tinnitus get used to it over time; for a minority, it remains a significant problem.

==Epidemiology==
===Adults===
Tinnitus affects 1015% of people. About a third of North Americans over 55 experience it. It affects one third of adults at some time in their lives, whereas 10–15% are disturbed enough to seek medical evaluation.
70 million people in Europe are estimated to have tinnitus.

===Children===
Tinnitus is commonly thought of as a symptom of adulthood, and is often overlooked in children. Children with hearing loss have a high incidence of pediatric tinnitus, even though they do not express the condition or its effect on their lives. Children do not generally report tinnitus spontaneously and their complaints may not be taken seriously. Among those who do complain, there is an increased likelihood of associated otological or neurological pathology such as migraine, juvenile Meniere&#x27;s disease, or chronic suppurative otitis media. Its reported prevalence varies from 12 to 36% in children with normal hearing thresholds, and up to 66% in children with a hearing loss. Approximately 3–10% of children have been reported to be troubled by tinnitus.

<text>Andrew Goodman (November 23, 1943June 21, 1964) was an American civil rights activist. He was one of three Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) workers murdered in Philadelphia, Mississippi, by members of the Ku Klux Klan in 1964. Goodman and two fellow activists, James Chaney and Michael Schwerner, were volunteers for the Freedom Summer campaign that sought to register African-Americans to vote in Mississippi and to set up Freedom Schools for black Southerners.

==Early life and beginnings of activism==
Andrew Goodman was born on November 23, 1943, in New York City, the second of three boys born to Robert, a writer and civil engineer, and Carolyn Goodman, a psychologist and social activist. He grew up in the city&#x27;s Upper East Side. Goodman was Jewish, like fellow civil rights activist Michael Schwerner, alongside whom Goodman would be murdered. Goodman&#x27;s neighborhood was a racially-mixed community of white, black, and Hispanic families.

The Goodman family was involved in intellectual and socially progressive activism and were devoted to social justice. His mother Carolyn was a lifelong labor activist. In her youth, she helped farm workers to organize and was active in community efforts to support the Republican faction during the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s.

Andrew followed his parents&#x27; activist bent from a young age. At the age of 14, Goodman traveled to Washington, D.C., to participate in the 1958 Youth March for Integrated Schools. During the march, approximately 10,000 high school age students promoted the desegregation of American public schools after the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s Brown v. Board of Education landmark decision in 1954 struck down the constitutionality of racial segregation in public schools. The next year, Goodman and a friend went to West Virginia to live in a coal mining town and sought to advocate to the governor over the poor working conditions there. At 17, Goodman traveled to Western Europe to understand the impact of largescale agribusiness on small farmers. Goodman also participated in a 1960 protest at a New York Woolworth&#x27;s as part of the sit-in movement protesting the segregationist policies of the five-and-dime store.

In 1961, Goodman graduated high school from the progressive Walden School, where he had attended from the age of 3. At Walden, he was involved in the theater program. He also arranged for Brooklyn Dodger Jackie Robinson, a neighbor of his and the first African-American to play in Major League Baseball, to speak at the school. After Walden, Goodman enrolled the Honors Program at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and considered a drama major, but withdrew after one semester after falling ill with pneumonia. He returned to New York City to improve his health and was selected for a role in the Off-Broadway play &quot;The Chief Thing&quot; by Russian dramatist Nikolaí Evreninov.

Goodman then enrolled at Queens College, New York City, and majored in anthropology. At Queens, he was a friend and classmate of Paul Simon. He developed an interest in poetry. One of his poems, &quot;A Corollary to a Poem by A. E. Housman&quot;, was posthumously discovered by his college professor Mary Doyle Curran and published in the &quot;Massachusetts Review&quot; and the &quot;New York Times&quot;. With Goodman&#x27;s brief acting experience, he originally planned to study drama but switched to anthropology. Goodman&#x27;s growing interest in anthropology seemed to parallel his increasing political seriousness. Throughout college, Goodman acted with an Off-Broadway repertory company.

==Participation in Freedom Summer==

In the spring of 1964, his junior year at Queens College, Goodman attended a talk by Mississippi civil rights activists Aaron Henry, head of the state&#x27;s NAACP branch, and Fannie Lou Hamer. Henry and Hamer were recruiting students under the age of 21, who with the permission of their parents, would participate in the Freedom Summer project to help register African-Americans to vote in Mississippi and to set up Freedom Schools.

In June 1964, Goodman left New York to teach at a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) training session for Freedom Summer volunteers at the Western College for Women (now part of Miami University) in Oxford, Ohio. In Ohio, Goodman met fellow New Yorker 24 year old Michael Schwerner, an experienced volunteer with CORE, and 21 year old James Chaney, a CORE activist in Mississippi. The three trained hundreds of Freedom Summer volunteers, mostly students, how to navigate the racism and violence they would encounter in Mississippi. At the training, Schwerner learned that one of the Freedom Schools in Mississippi that he had helped to organize at the Mount Zion Methodist Church in Philadelphia had been burned down by the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). To investigate, the three men left Ohio for Mississippi by car on June 20.

===Arrest and murder===

On June 21, their first full day in the state, the trio drove from their home base of Meridian for Philadelphia, a community about an hour from Meridian, to visit the church ruins and meet with church members. When they were driving back to Meridian, they were pulled over by Neshoba County, Mississippi Deputy Sheriff Cecil Price (a KKK member), for allegedly driving 65 miles-per-hour in a 30-mile-per-hour speed limit zone. Price arrested the three men and took them to the Neshoba County jail, where Chaney was booked for speeding, while Schwerner and Goodman were booked &quot;for investigation&quot;. Chaney was charged a $20 fine and the three men were released around 10:30pm on and instructed to leave the county. However, while Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman were in custody, Price contacted local KKK leader and minister Edgar Ray Killen and informed him of the three activists in custody. According to a subsequent U.S. Department of Justice investigation, Killen then gathered other KKK members and devised a plot to attack the three as they left the jail.

Price followed them in his patrol car. At 10:25, Price sped to catch up with the station wagon before it crossed the border into the relative safety of Lauderdale County. Price ordered the three out of their car and into his. He drove them to a deserted area on Rock Cut Road while followed by two cars filled with other Klansmen. Price turned the trio over to the Klansmen who, after beating Chaney, shot and killed Schwerner, Goodman, and Chaney. An autopsy of Goodman, showing fragments of red clay in his lungs and grasped in his fists, suggests he was probably buried alive alongside the already dead Chaney and Schwerner.

The Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission was strongly opposed to integration and civil rights. It paid spies to identify citizens suspected of activism, especially people from the North and West who entered the state. The records opened by court order in 1998 also revealed the state&#x27;s deep complicity in the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner, because its investigator A. L. Hopkins passed on to the Commission information about the workers, including the car license number of a new civil rights worker. Records showed the Commission, in turn, passed the information on to the Neshoba County Sheriff, who was implicated in the murders.

===Investigation and trial===
The murders changed the course of the Civil Rights Movement:

Willie Blue, a surviving participant in the Freedom Summer movement said: &quot;Goodman&#x27;s richer than whipped cream. He wasn&#x27;t supposed to die in Vietnam; he sure wasn&#x27;t supposed to die in Mississippi. When America&#x27;s brightest are murdered for doing something fundamentally American, suddenly the world knows about Mississippi. It was another nail in the segregated coffin.&quot; The FBI entered the case after the men disappeared. They helped find them buried in an earthen dam. The US government prosecuted the case under the Enforcement Act of 1870. The Neshoba County deputy sheriff and six conspirators were convicted by Federal prosecutors of civil rights violations but were not convicted of murder. Two defendants were acquitted because the jury deadlocked.

==Reinvestigation==

Journalist Jerry Mitchell, an award-winning investigative reporter for the &quot;Jackson Clarion-Ledger&quot;, had written extensively about the case for many years. Mitchell, who had already earned fame for helping secure convictions in several other high-profile civil rights era murder cases, including the assassination of Medgar Evers in Jackson, Mississippi, the Birmingham, Alabama 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, and the murder of Vernon Dahmer in Mississippi, developed new evidence, found new witnesses and pressured the state to take action. Barry Bradford, an Illinois high-school teacher later famous for helping clear the name of civil rights martyr Clyde Kennard, and three students, Allison Nichols, Sarah Siegel, and Brittany Saltiel, joined Mitchell&#x27;s efforts.

Bradford and his students&#x27; documentary, produced for the National History Day contest, presented important new evidence and compelling reasons for reopening the Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner case. They also obtained an interview with Edgar Ray Killen, which helped persuade the state to open the case for investigation. Mitchell was able to determine the identity of &quot;Mr. X&quot;, the mystery informer who had helped the FBI discover the bodies and smash the conspiracy of the Klan in 1964, in part using evidence developed by Bradford and the students.

On January 7, 2005, Edgar Ray Killen was arrested. He was found guilty of three counts of manslaughternot murderon June 21, 2005, exactly 41 years to the day after the murders. He was sentenced to sixty years in prison—twenty years for each count, to be served consecutively. He appealed the verdict, but the sentence was upheld on April 12, 2007, by the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He died in prison on January 11, 2018, at age 93.

On June 20, 2016, just one day ahead of the 52nd anniversary of the murders, Attorney General Hood announced an end to the federal and state investigations into the &#x27;Mississippi Murders&#x27;, officially closing the case.

==Legacy and honors==
In 1966, Andrew&#x27;s parents, Robert and Carolyn Goodman started The Andrew Goodman Foundation to carry on the spirit and purpose of their son&#x27;s life. After the death of Robert Goodman in 1969, Carolyn continued the work of the Foundation, focusing on projects like a reverse march to Mississippi and a 25th Anniversary Memorial. The memorial, which took place at St. John The Divine Church in NYC, was attended by 10,000 people and was presided by Governor Mario Cuomo, Maya Angelou, Pete Seeger, Aaron Henry, Harry Belafonte, and others closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement. After Carolyn&#x27;s death in August 2007, David Goodman, Andrew&#x27;s younger brother, and Sylvia Golbin Goodman, David&#x27;s wife, took up the work of the Foundation.

For nearly 50 years, the organization was a private foundation acting in the public interest. With their eyes set on the future, the Board of Trustees of The Andrew Goodman Foundation elected to turn the organization into a public charity in 2012. In 2014, on the fiftieth anniversary of the murders, the Foundation officially launched Vote Everywhere program designed to support college students who are continuing the work of Freedom Summer.

<text>The Lac de Guiers or Lake Guiers is a lake in northern Senegal, south of the city of Richard-Toll and in the Louga and Saint-Louis regions. It is a chief source of fresh water for the city of Dakar, hundreds of kilometers to the south-west, through underground pipes.

It is about 35 kilometers long and 8 kilometers wide, and is supplied by the Ferlo or Bounoum River, which flows north into its southern end, from Fouta in the rainy season. Water flows out to the Senegal River north through the , which has been straightened and canalized as it passes through Richard-Toll. A dam was built in 1916 to prevent saltwater flowing in.

The shores are mostly fertile. The north shore and surrounding area have been converted to a large sugar-growing region irrigated with water from the lake.

Lac de Guiers is designated an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International; the key species are lesser flamingo (&quot;Phoeniconaias minor&quot;), glossy ibis (&quot;Plegadis falcinellus&quot;), Eurasian spoonbill (&quot;Platalea leucorodia&quot;), African spoonbill (&quot;Platalea alba&quot;), white-winged tern (&quot;Chlidonias leucopterus&quot;) and river prinia (&quot;Prinia fluviatilis&quot;).

The lake has a complicated history involving the kingdoms of Tekrur and Waalo and the Empire of Jolof (Diolof). Notably, the settlement of N&#x27;Der, the third and final capital of the former Kingdom of Waalo, was located on the west shores of the Lake. The royal compound or &quot;keur&quot; is still there. Previously Lac de Guiers was called Lac du Panier Foule or Pania Fuli, referring to the Fula people.

<text>The City of Shoalhaven is a local government area in the South Coast region of New South Wales, Australia. The area is about south of Sydney. The Princes Highway passes through the area, and the South Coast railway line traverses the northern section, terminating at Bomaderry. At the , the population was 108,531.

The City was established on 1 July 1948 as the Shoalhaven Shire, following the amalgamation of the Municipalities of Nowra, Berry, Broughton&#x27;s Vale, Ulladulla, South Shoalhaven, and the shires of Cambewarra and Clyde. The Governor of NSW on 13 July 1979 proclaimed Shoalhaven as a city. The Shire was converted and constituted on 1 August 1979 simultaneously as a municipality and city.

==History==
Modern-day groupings of the Illawarra and South Coast Aboriginal peoples are based on information compiled by white anthropologists from the late 1870s. Two divisions were initially presented (refer Ridley, 1878), using geographical location and language, though these criteria are now expanded into five divisions and given Aboriginal names, as follows (after C.Sefton, 1983):

* Dharawal – general name for the Aboriginal people of the area on the east coast of New South Wales from Botany Bay to Shoalhaven, and west to Berrima and Camden.
* Wodiwodi (or Wadi-Wadi) – a subdivision of Thuruwal, includes the Aboriginal people of the coast from Wollongong to Shoalhaven.
* Gurandada and Tharumba (or Dharumba) – those people living around the Shoalhaven River.

The Jerrinja people record their traditional lands as stretching from Crooked River in the north to Clyde River in the south, from the mountains to the sea at Roseby Park.

George Bass explored the area in 1797, following Seven Mile Beach. He crossed the shoals at the entrance to the river, calling it &quot;Shoals Haven&quot; due to the shallowness of the river mouth. This river is now known as the Crookhaven, but the name was adopted for the Shoalhaven area and the Shoalhaven River.

==Towns and localities in the local government area==

Shoalhaven, although designated a city, is a dispersed region spread over of coastline, with the vast majority of its population located in the north-east around Nowra, Jervis Bay and Sussex Inlet.

It includes the following towns, suburbs and localities:

The Shoalhaven can be reached from Sydney by car via the Princes Highway and by rail via the South Coast railway line which terminates just north of Nowra at Bomaderry. The Shoalhaven is adjacent to the Jervis Bay Territory. The area is approximately long along the coastline, including 109 beaches, which allegedly possesses the whitest sand in the world, as well as pristine natural Australian bushland. The Shoalhaven area is home to numerous species of native Australian flora and fauna.

The area is well known for its strong commitment to the arts and music, featuring the See Change and See Celebrations festivals in the Jervis Bay and St Georges Basin areas, as well as the EscapeArtfest festival and Blessing of the Fleet in the Ulladulla area.

Tourists to Shoalhaven can enjoy a wealth of cultural and nature-based activities and experiences, including whale-watching, kayaking, visiting beaches and tastings at wineries.

<doc id="101984" wikidata="Q355438" url="?curid=101984" title="Patrick O'Brian">
<text>Patrick O&#x27;Brian (12 December 1914 – 2 January 2000), born Richard Patrick Russ, was an English novelist and translator, best known for his Aubrey–Maturin series. These sea novels are set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars and centre on the friendship of the English naval captain Jack Aubrey and the Irish–Catalan physician Stephen Maturin. The 20-novel series, the first of which is &quot;Master and Commander&quot;, is known for its well-researched and highly detailed portrayal of early 19th-century life, as well as its authentic and evocative language. A partially finished 21st novel in the series was published posthumously containing facing pages of handwriting and typescript.

O&#x27;Brian wrote a number of other novels and short stories, most of which were published before he achieved success with the Aubrey–Maturin series. He also translated works from French to English, and wrote biographies of Joseph Banks and Picasso.

His major success as a writer came late in life, when the Aubrey–Maturin series caught the eye of an American publisher. The series drew more readers and favourable reviews when the author was in his seventies. Near the end of his life, and in the same year that he lost his wife, British media revealed details of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s early life, first marriage, and post-war change of name, causing distress to the very private author and to many of his readers at that time.

==Personal life and privacy==

===Childhood, early career and marriages===
O&#x27;Brian was christened as Richard Patrick Russ, in Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, a son of Charles Russ, an English physician of German descent, and Jessie Russ (née Goddard), an English woman of Irish descent. The eighth of nine children, O&#x27;Brian lost his mother at the age of four, and his biographers describe a fairly isolated childhood, limited by poverty, with sporadic schooling, at St Marylebone Grammar School from 1924 to 1926, while living in Putney, and then at Lewes Grammar School, from September 1926 to July 1929, after the family moved to Lewes, East Sussex, but with intervals at home with his father and stepmother Zoe Center.

His literary career began in his childhood, with the publication of his earliest works, including several short stories. The book &quot;Hussein, An Entertainment&quot; published by Oxford University Press in 1938, and the short-story collection &quot;Beasts Royal&quot; brought considerable critical praise, especially considering his youth. He published his first novel at age 15, &quot;Caesar: The Life Story of a Panda Leopard&quot;, with help from his father.

In 1927 he applied unsuccessfully to enter the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. In 1934, he underwent a brief period of pilot training with the Royal Air Force, but that was not successful and he left the RAF. Prior to that, his application to join the Royal Navy had been rejected on health grounds. In 1935, he was living in London, where he married his first wife, Elizabeth Jones, in 1936. They had two children. The second was a daughter who suffered from spina bifida, and died in 1942, aged three, in a country village in Sussex. When the child died, O&#x27;Brian had already returned to London, where he worked throughout the war.

The details of his employment during the Second World War are murky. He worked as an ambulance driver, and he stated that he worked in intelligence in the Political Intelligence Department (PID). Dean King has said O&#x27;Brian was actively involved in intelligence work and perhaps special operations overseas during the war. Indeed, despite his usual extreme reticence about his past, O&#x27;Brian wrote in an essay, &quot;Black, Choleric and Married?&quot;, included in the book &quot;Patrick O&#x27;Brian: Critical Appreciations and a Bibliography&quot; (1994) that: &quot;Some time after the blitz had died away I joined one of those intelligence organisations that flourished during the War, perpetually changing their initials and competing with one another. Our work had to do with France, and more than that I shall not say, since disclosing methods and stratagems that have deceived the enemy once and that may deceive him again seems to me foolish. After the war we retired to Wales (I say we because my wife and I had driven ambulances and served in intelligence together) where we lived for a while in a high Welsh-speaking valley...&quot; which confirms in first person the intelligence connection, as well as introducing his wife Mary Tolstoy, née Wicksteed, as a co-worker and fellow intelligence operative.

Nikolai Tolstoy, stepson through O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s marriage to Mary, disputes that account, confirming only that O&#x27;Brian worked as a volunteer ambulance driver during the Blitz when he met Mary, the separated wife of Russian-born nobleman and lawyer Count Dimitri Tolstoy. They lived together through the latter part of the war and, after both were divorced from their previous spouses, they married in July 1945. The following month he changed his name by deed poll to Patrick O&#x27;Brian.

=== Sailing experience ===
As background to his later sea-going novels, O&#x27;Brian did claim to have had limited experience on a square-rigged sailing vessel, as described within his previously-quoted 1994 essay:

However, in 1995, venture capitalist Thomas Perkins offered O&#x27;Brian a two-week cruise aboard his then sailing yacht, a ketch. In an article about the experience written after O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s death, Perkins commented that &quot;... his knowledge of the practical aspects of sailing seemed, amazingly, almost nil&quot; and &quot;... he seemed to have no feeling for the wind and the course, and frequently I had to intervene to prevent a full standing gybe. I began to suspect that his autobiographical references to his months at sea as a youth were fanciful.&quot;

===Life after the Second World War===
Between 1946 and 1949 the O&#x27;Brians lived in Cwm Croesor, a remote valley in north Wales, where they initially rented a cottage from Clough Williams-Ellis. O&#x27;Brian pursued his interest in natural history; he fished, went birdwatching, and followed the local hunt. During this time they lived on Mary O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s small income and the limited earnings from O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s writings.

In 1949 O&#x27;Brian and Mary moved to Collioure, a Catalan town in southern France. He and Mary remained together in Collioure until her death in 1998. Mary&#x27;s love and support were critical to O&#x27;Brian throughout his career. She worked with him in the British Library in the 1940s as he collected source material for his anthology &quot;A Book of Voyages&quot;, which became the first book to bear his new name – the book was among his favourites, because of this close collaboration. The death of his wife in March 1998 was a tremendous blow to O&#x27;Brian. In the last two years of his life, particularly once the details of his early life were revealed to the world, he was a &quot;lonely, tortured, and at the last possibly paranoid figure.&quot;

===Media exposure and controversy in his final years===
O&#x27;Brian protected his privacy fiercely and was usually reluctant to reveal any details about his private life or past, preferring to include no biographical details on his book jackets and supplying only a minimum of personal information when pressed to do so. For many years reviewers and journalists presumed he was Irish, and he took no steps to correct the impression. One interviewer, Mark Horowitz, described the man in his late seventies as &quot;a compact, austere gentleman. ... his pale, watchful eyes are clear and alert.&quot; He is polite, formal, and erudite in conversation, an erudition that Horowitz said could be intimidating. He learned from those who worked with O&#x27;Brian that the erudition did not go unnoticed, while they remained friends.

Richard Ollard, a naval historian, calls this particular habit &quot;blowing people out of the game.&quot; Ollard, who edited the early Aubrey–Maturin novels, urged O&#x27;Brian to tone down the most obscure allusions, though the books remain crammed with Latin tags, antiquated medical terminology and an endless stream of marvellous-sounding but impenetrable naval jargon. &quot;Like many who have struggled themselves&quot;, Ollard said of his friend, &quot;he thought others should struggle, too.&quot; One longtime acquaintance put it more bluntly: &quot;Patrick can be a bit of a snob, socially and intellectually.&quot;

In 1998, a BBC documentary and an exposé in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; made public the facts of his ancestry, original name and first marriage, provoking considerable critical media comment. In his biography of O&#x27;Brian, Nikolai Tolstoy claims to give a more accurate and balanced account of his late stepfather&#x27;s character, actions and motives, particularly in respect of his first marriage and family.

John Lanchester in reviewing Tolstoy&#x27;s book, says &quot;The last few years have been disheartening for Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s many fans.&quot; He does not find the arguments altogether persuasive, and with access to documents that Dean King never saw, Tolstoy &quot;gives a portrait of a man who is cold, bullying, isolated, snobbish and super-sensitive.&quot; Lanchester closes by saying &quot;Let&#x27;s agree, we O&#x27;Brianists, to read the novels and forget everything else.&quot; Veale, in reviewing King&#x27;s book, says that &quot;however judicious and well-grounded his [King&#x27;s] speculation, he fails to crack his subject&#x27;s protective shell. In the end, Aubrey and Maturin will have to thrive on their own—which is how the willfully enigmatic O&#x27;Brian most likely intended it.&quot;

Horowitz interviewed O&#x27;Brian at his home in France in 1994: &quot;Until recently, he refused all interviews. Those authors we know the least about, he says, are the ones we get in their purest form, like Homer. In &quot;Clarissa Oakes&quot; (published as &quot;The Truelove&quot; in the US), Stephen warns would-be interviewers that &quot;question and answer is not a civilised form of conversation.&quot; O&#x27;Brian deflects direct inquiries about his private life, and when asked why he moved to the south of France after World War II, he stops and fixes his interrogator with a cold stare. &quot;That seems to be getting rather close to a personal question,&quot; he says softly, walking on.&quot;

At his death, many obituaries were published evaluating his work, particularly in the Aubrey–Maturin series, and the revelations of his biography prior to his marriage to Mary Wicksteed Tolstoy. Playwright David Mamet wrote an appreciation. His American publisher, W. W. Norton, wrote an appreciation, mentioning their story with O&#x27;Brian, how pleased they were the three times he came to the US, in 1993, 1995 and in November 1999 only weeks before his death, and noting sales in the US alone of over three million copies.

==Death==
He continued to work on his naval novels until his death and spent the winter of 1998–1999 at Trinity College Dublin. He died there on 2 January 2000. His body was returned to Collioure, where he is buried next to his wife.

The &quot;Amis de Patrick O&#x27;Brian&quot; association, (friends of Patrick O&#x27;Brian), which is located in Collioure, was bequeathed O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s desk and various of his writing artefacts and research materials.

==Literary career==

===As Patrick Russ===
O&#x27;Brian published two novels, a collection of stories and several uncollected stories under his original name, Richard Patrick Russ. His first novel, &quot;Caesar: The Life Story of a Panda-Leopard&quot;, was written at the age of 12 and published three years later in 1930. It was a critical success, with a recommendation in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and positive reviews in publications including the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Saturday Review of Literature&quot;. Other stories followed, published in boys&#x27; magazines and annuals and incorporating themes of natural history and adventure, and a collection of these and other animal stories was published in 1934 under the title &quot;Beasts Royal&quot;, with illustrations by the noted artist Charles Tunnicliffe, illustrator of &quot;Tarka the Otter&quot;.

&quot;Hussein: An entertainment&quot;, set in India, was published in 1938, when O&#x27;Brian was 23. It was notable for being the first book of contemporary fiction ever published by the Oxford University Press, to whose annuals for boys he had been a regular contributor for some years. O&#x27;Brian published very little under his original name of Russ during World War II, and nothing after 1940. His change of surname in 1945 necessarily meant abandoning the literary reputation he had built up as R P Russ.

===As Patrick O&#x27;Brian===
O&#x27;Brian returned to writing after the war when he moved to rural Wales. His non-fiction anthology &quot;A Book of Voyages&quot; (1947) attracted little attention. A collection of short stories, &quot;The Last Pool&quot;, was published in 1950 and was more widely and favourably reviewed, although sales were low. The countryside and people around his village in Wales provided inspiration for many of his short stories of the period, and also his novel &quot;Testimonies&quot; (1952), which is set in a thinly disguised Cwm Croesor, and which was well received by Delmore Schwartz in &quot;Partisan Review&quot; in 1952. His next novel was &quot;The Catalans&quot;, published in 1953. The review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s accomplishments in &quot;Testimonies&quot;; &quot;The Catalans&quot; was viewed as a series of well-written scenes by an observant author, but the reviewer did not think it held together as a novel.

In the 1950s, O&#x27;Brian wrote three books aimed at a younger age group, &quot;The Road to Samarcand&quot;, &quot;The Golden Ocean&quot;, and &quot;The Unknown Shore&quot;. Although written many years before the Aubrey–Maturin series, the two naval novels reveal literary antecedents of Aubrey and Maturin. In &quot;The Golden Ocean&quot; and &quot;The Unknown Shore&quot;, based on events of George Anson&#x27;s voyage around the world from 1740 to 1744, they can be clearly seen in the characters of Jack Byron and Tobias Barrow in the latter novel.

Over four decades he worked on his own writings, his British literary reputation growing slowly. He became an established translator of French works into English. His early novels and several of the translations were published by Rupert Hart-Davis from 1953 to 1974. O&#x27;Brian wrote the first of the Aubrey–Maturin series in 1969 at the suggestion of American publisher J B Lippincott, following the 1966 death of C. S. Forester, a writer of popular nautical novels. The Aubrey–Maturin books were quietly popular in Britain; after the first four volumes, they were not published in the United States.

In the early 1990s, the series was successfully relaunched into the American market by the interest of Starling Lawrence of W. W. Norton publishers, attracting critical acclaim and dramatically increasing O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s sales and public profile in the UK and America. Paul D. Colford notes that when O&#x27;Brian &quot;visited the United States a few weeks ago [in December 1993], fans waiting to meet, lunch and have tea with him included Walter Cronkite, Sen. Dirk Kempthorne (R-Idaho) and Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who invited O&#x27;Brian to attend a session of the high court. Hollywood also wants a piece of the press-shy storyteller.&quot;

The novels sold over three million copies in 20 languages. In its review of &quot;21: The Final Unfinished Voyage of Jack Aubrey&quot; (published in 2004), &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said that over six million copies had been sold. Thus O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s greatest success in writing, gaining him fame, a following, and invitations to events and interviews came late in his life, when he was well into his seventies and accustomed to his privacy.

Shortly before his last completed novel was published in October 1999, O&#x27;Brian wrote an article for a series of the best in the millennium ending, titled &quot;Full Nelson&quot;, choosing for his topic Admiral Nelson&#x27;s victory in the Battle of the Nile in 1798.

===Aubrey–Maturin series===

Beginning in 1969, O&#x27;Brian began writing what turned into the 20-volume Aubrey–Maturin series of novels. The books are set in the early 19th century and describe the lives and careers of Captain Jack Aubrey of the Royal Navy and his friend, naval physician and naturalist Dr Stephen Maturin, a man of Irish and Catalan parents. The books are distinguished by O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s deliberate use and adaptation of actual historical events, either integrating his protagonists in the action without changing the outcome, or using adapted historical events as templates. In addition to this trait and to O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s distinctive literary style, his sense of humour is prominent (see Humour in main article, &quot;Aubrey–Maturin series&quot;).

The series employs technical sailing terminology throughout. Some critics consider the books a roman fleuve, which can be read as one long story; the books follow Aubrey and Maturin&#x27;s professional and domestic lives continuously.

===Other works===
As well as his historical novels, O&#x27;Brian wrote three adult mainstream novels, six short-story collections, and a history of the Royal Navy aimed at young readers. He was also a respected translator, responsible for more than 30 translations from the French into English, including Henri Charrière&#x27;s &quot;Papillon&quot; (UK) and &quot;Banco: The further adventures of Papillon&quot;, Jean Lacouture&#x27;s biography of Charles de Gaulle, as well as many of Simone de Beauvoir&#x27;s later works.

O&#x27;Brian wrote detailed biographies of Sir Joseph Banks, an English naturalist who took part in Cook&#x27;s first voyage (and who appears briefly in O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Aubrey-Maturin series), and Pablo Picasso. His biography of Picasso is a massive and comprehensive study of the artist. Picasso and O&#x27;Brian both lived in the French village of Collioure and became acquainted there.

Peter Weir&#x27;s 2003 film, &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; is loosely based on the novel &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot; from the Aubrey–Maturin series for its plot, but draws on a number of the novels for incidents within the film. The character of Jack Aubrey is drawn from the character in the novels.

===Awards, honours and recognition===
In 1995 he was awarded the inaugural Heywood Hill Literary Prize, in the amount of £10,000 for his lifetime&#x27;s writings. In his acceptance speech in July 1995, O&#x27;Brian, then age 80, said it was the first literary prize of his adult life. He received an honorary doctorate from Trinity College Dublin, and a CBE on June 17, 1997.

On 21–23 September 2001, the National Museum of the Royal Navy, Portsmouth, organised a &quot;The Patrick O&#x27;Brian Weekend&quot; to celebrate O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s achievement in depicting Nelson&#x27;s Navy in his novels. The weekend featured lectures by some of Britain&#x27;s leading naval historians on &quot;how the novels closely reflect the insights of modern scholarship&quot;. There was a concert of contemporary music and readings from his books. The weekend concluded with a tour of Nelson&#x27;s flagship HMS &quot;Victory&quot; followed by a dinner on her lower gundeck. The event was repeated one year later at the same venue.

==Original manuscripts==
O&#x27;Brian claimed that he wrote &quot;like a Christian, with ink and quill&quot;; Mary was his first reader and typed his manuscripts &quot;pretty&quot; for the publisher. O&#x27;Brian handwrote all his books and stories, shunning both typewriter and word processor. The handwritten manuscripts for 18 Aubrey-Maturin novels have been acquired by the Lilly Library at Indiana University. Only two, &quot;The Letter of Marque&quot; and &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot;, owned by Stuart Bennet, remain in private hands. Bennet donated his correspondence from O&#x27;Brian to the Lilly Library; one letter recommends to Bennet that he donate the two manuscripts he holds to Indiana University, where the rest of the manuscripts reside. The O&#x27;Brian manuscript collection at the Lilly Library also includes the manuscripts for &quot;Picasso&quot; and &quot;Joseph Banks&quot; and detailed notes for six Aubrey/Maturin novels. The 2011 exhibit Blue at the Mizzen suggests that the manuscript was donated.

Nikolai Tolstoy also has an extensive collection of O&#x27;Brian manuscript material, including the second half of &quot;Hussein&quot;, several short stories, much of the reportedly &quot;lost&quot; book on Bestiaries, letters, diaries, journals, notes, poems, book reviews, and several unpublished short stories.

==Published biographies of O&#x27;Brian==
Since O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s death, two biographies have been published, though the first was well advanced when he died. The second is by O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s stepson Nikolai Tolstoy.

Dean King&#x27;s &quot;Patrick O&#x27;Brian: A Life Revealed&quot; was the first biography to document O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s early life under his original name.

Tolstoy&#x27;s two-volume biography, &quot;Patrick O&#x27;Brian: The Making of the Novelist&quot; (2004) and &quot;Patrick O&#x27;Brian: A Very Private Life&quot; (2019) make use of material from the Russ and Tolstoy families and sources, including O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s personal papers and library which Tolstoy inherited on O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s death.

<text>The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser (; lit. &quot;Every Man for Himself and God Against All&quot;) is a 1974 West German drama film written and directed by Werner Herzog and starring Bruno S. and Walter Ladengast. The film closely follows the real story of foundling Kaspar Hauser, using the text of actual letters found with Hauser.

==Plot==
The film follows Kaspar Hauser, who has lived the first seventeen years of his life chained in a tiny cellar with only a toy horse to occupy his time, devoid of all human contact except for a man wearing a black overcoat and top hat, who fed him.

One day, in 1828, the same man takes Hauser out of his cell, teaches him a few phrases, and how to walk, before leaving him in the town of Nuremberg. Hauser becomes the subject of much curiosity, and is exhibited in a circus before being rescued by Professor Georg Friedrich Daumer, who patiently attempts to transform him.

Hauser soon learns to read and write, and develops unorthodox approaches to logic and religion; but music is what pleases him most. He attracts the attention of academics, clergy and nobility. He is then physically attacked by the same unknown man who brought him to Nuremberg. The attack leaves him unconscious with a bleeding head. He recovers, but is again mysteriously attacked; this time, stabbed in the chest.

Hauser rests in bed describing visions he has had of nomadic Berbers in the Sahara, and then dies. An autopsy reveals an enlarged liver and cerebellum.

==Production==
===Writing===
Herzog has been quoted as saying that the title for the film () was inspired by a sentence in the novel &quot;Macunaíma&quot; by Brazilian writer Mário de Andrade.

The film follows the real story of Kaspar Hauser quite closely, using the text of actual letters found with Hauser, and following many details in the opening sequence of Hauser&#x27;s confinement and release. The characters of Professor Daumer and of Lord Stanhope are also based on historical figures, Georg Friedrich Daumer and Philip Henry Stanhope, 4th Earl Stanhope, respectively.

An English-language translation of the screenplay was published in 1980 by Tanam Press.

===Casting and crew===
Herzog discovered the lead actor, Bruno Schleinstein, in a documentary about street musicians &quot;Bruno der Schwarze, es blies ein Jäger wohl in sein Horn&quot; (lit. &quot;Bruno the Black One, A Hunter Blows his Horn&quot;). Fascinated, Herzog cast him as the lead for &quot;The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser&quot; despite the fact that he had no training as an actor. Further, the historical Hauser was 17 when he was discovered in Nuremberg and the film implies this. Schleinstein was 41 years old at the time of filming, although his character is treated and described throughout as a youth. Schleinstein&#x27;s own life bore some similarities to Kaspar Hauser&#x27;s, and his own unbalanced personality was often expressed on set. In Herzog&#x27;s commentary for the English language DVD release, he recalls that Schleinstein remained in costume for the entire duration of the production, even after shooting was done for the day. Herzog once visited him in his hotel room, to find him sleeping on the floor by the door, in his costume. Schleinstein was credited only as &quot;Bruno S.&quot; in the film. Herzog subsequently wrote Schleinstein into the screenplay for a second film, &quot;Stroszek&quot; (1977).

The production designer for the film was Henning von Gierke; the costume designers were Ann Poppel and Gisela Storch.

===Filming locations===
The outdoor scenes were filmed in the town of Dinkelsbühl and on a nearby mountain called Hesselberg.
* Croagh Patrick, Westport, Mayo, Ireland (archive footage)
* Dinkelsbühl, Bavaria, West Germany 
* Western Sahara

===Music===
The music includes pieces by a number of notable composers:
*Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart – &quot;Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd schön&quot; (1791) (from the opera &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;) – sung by Heinrich Knote (1911)
*Johann Pachelbel – Canon in D Major (1700)
*Orlando di Lasso – Requiem à 5
*Tomaso Albinoni – Adagio – arrangement: Remo Giazotto (ca 1945)

==Reception==
===Critical response===
In 2005, critic Walter Chaw summed up the film as &quot;a strange, brave performance housed in an anti-linear film stuffed with obscure images and silent passages of profound, frightening insight&quot;, adding &quot;That the director identifies so deeply with a foundling in 19th century Germany who appeared in the middle of a town square having spent his whole life chained to a floor in a basement dungeon speaks volumes to Herzog&#x27;s feeling of detachment in intellectual, artistic, and social environments.&quot; In 2007, the critic Roger Ebert wrote a retrospective review of the film, which he had included in his list of &quot;Great Movies&quot;, saying &quot;In Herzog the line between fact and fiction is a shifting one. He cares not for accuracy but for effect, for a transcendent ecstasy.&quot;

Writing in 2001, Maria Racheva said &quot;.. Herzog, the director, unlike François Truffaut in &quot;The Wild Child&quot;, is not interested in showing the painful process of adaptation to civilized surroundings; Kaspar has a special consciousness in which the laws of nature have a central place and in which the conventions and norms of civilized behavior are as artificial and inconvenient to him as the black dinner jacket he is forced to wear. His difficulties in communication are not the result of any linguistic inadequacies; simply, he is &quot;different&quot; from other men. That is why Herzog seems to wish to persuade us that, despite being gratuitous, both the early isolation and the surprising death of his hero are somehow logical. ... This summary of plot sounds like a fairy tale—and it is. Most of Herzog&#x27;s films recall fables, and that is surely one of the reasons for their success.&quot;

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 92% score based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 8.7/10.

In 2017 David Fear and Peter Travers, in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, said: &quot;Based on the true story of a young man who spent the first 17 years of his life never leaving his tiny room – and then became a public sensation when he finally ventured out into society – Herzog&#x27;s cracked biopic would have felt offbeat and intriguing enough on its own. Still, the director thought he&#x27;d make things even more interesting by casting a 41-year-old street musician credited as &quot;Bruno S.&quot; who had spent decades in and out of mental institutions and had never acted before. The result is one of the more odd and affecting performances in Herzog&#x27;s movies – part guileless, part gimmicky and all genuinely WTF. A bold experiment that paid off in a big way.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film was invited for the 1975 Cannes Film Festival. It won the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury, which is the second prize for films &quot;in competition&quot; at the festival; the first is the Palme d&#x27;Or. In addition, it won the FIPRESCI Prize and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. The film won two German Film Awards: to Beate Mainka-Jellinghaus for editing, and to Henning von Gierke for scene design. Herzog won the second prize (&quot;Filmband in Silber&quot;) in the category &quot;Feature Film Direction&quot; (&quot;programmfüllender Spielfilm&quot; (&quot;Gestaltung&quot;)), which came with a substantial cash prize. The film was selected as the West German entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 48th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nomination.

==Home media==
&quot;The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser&quot; was released to region 1 DVD in 2002. The film is included in a Blu-ray (region-A) collection of Herzog&#x27;s films that was published in the US in 2014 by Shout Factory. It was also included in a region-B collection published in the United Kingdom in 2014 by the BFI. It had been released in 1993 as a VHS tape with the English language title &quot;The Mystery of Kaspar Hauser&quot;.

<doc id="102000" wikidata="Q1142219" url="?curid=102000" title="Jorge Chávez International Airport">
<text>Jorge Chávez International Airport is the main international airport serving Lima, the capital of Peru. It is located in Callao, northwest of Lima Center, the nation&#x27;s capital city and from the district of Miraflores. In 2023, the airport served 22,876,785 passengers. Historically, the airport was the hub for Compañía de Aviación Faucett and Aeroperú. Now it serves as a hub for many aviation companies. The airport was named after Peruvian aviator Jorge Chávez (1887–1910). It is among the busiest and largest airports in South America.

Comparatively, it is the South American airport best connected to North America in terms of international flights, even surpassing others that have a greater volume of passengers. It is also one of the fastest growing airports in the region, having registered a 13% growth in passenger traffic during 2012. The recent free trade agreements signed by Peru with different Asian countries open the possibility of connecting to the airport with terminals in Asia and Oceania in the near future, that is, in late 2024 when the New Terminal begins operations, also foreseeing a greater number of connections with new cities.

In 2022 it entered the list of the 50 most important air hubs worldwide, occupying position number 47 after having been in position 58 in 2019 according to the international air statistics consultancy OAG.

On April 3, 2023, a second runway and a new control tower came into operation that will facilitate the growth of air movement. By March 2025, a new passenger terminal, currently under construction, will be inaugurated to absorb the increase in people in transit to and from South American cities.

== History ==

=== Construction ===

The airport was conceived in 1960 to replace the old Limatambo International Airport, which was located in the San Isidro District, because it had been surrounded by the new residential areas in the east of the city of Lima. Without the modern facilities built later, the first international flight was carried out on June 22, 1960; and four months later, on October 29, 1960, President Manuel Prado Ugarteche inaugurated it with the name Lima International Airport. Its later name is due to the young aviation pioneer, the Peruvian aviator Jorge Chávez.

Lima&#x27;s first airport was the Limatambo Airport in San Isidro. It ceased operations in 1960 due to a lack of space and capacity, and was replaced by the Lima-Callao International Airport, which was inaugurated by President Manuel Prado Ugarteche on 29 October of the same year. In June 1965, the Lima-Callao airport was renamed the &quot;Aeropuerto Internacional Jorge Chávez&quot; after the famous Peruvian aviator, Jorge Chávez Dartnell. In December 1965, the terminal building was officially opened by President Fernando Belaúnde after 11 months of reconstruction. The airport did not receive any renovation or change in infrastructure for 35 years.

After winning a competition to design the plans by the architects Carlos Arana, Antenor Orrego, Juan Torres, Miguel Bao and Luis Vásquez, and 11 months of reconstruction, it was officially reopened on December 30, 1965, by President Fernando Belaúnde. It was considered in its time as one of the most modern airports in Latin America due above all to the very advanced and award-winning architecture of the passenger terminal. The airport did not receive any major changes to its infrastructure for the next 35 years, except for isolated remodeling and expansions in different sectors of the terminal.

When it was in operation, Compañía de Aviación Faucett had its corporate headquarters on the airport premises. Aerolíneas Peruanas was founded in 1956 as Peru&#x27;s first flag carrier airline but would cease operations in 1971, being replaced by Aeroperú. For a long time, Aeroperú was the largest airline in Peru, and also one of the largest in South America. It would be declared bankrupt in 1999 after the Aeroperú Flight 603 accident, in which a Boeing 757 leaving the airport to Santiago, crashed in the Pacific Ocean, killing all 70 people on board. Along with Aeroperú, Faucett Perú and other large airlines would also cease operations. LATAM Peru, then known as LAN Peru, would become the largest airline in Peru, controlling most of the domestic market.

=== Projects and expansion ===
By decision of the Government of Peru, in 2001, it was awarded a concession to the company Lima Airport Partners (LAP), a German-American consortium of Fraport, with the purpose of undertaking its expansion and comprehensive remodeling. As part of the process, the Peruvian congressional commission held talks with LAP. These conversations resulted in an agreement in which LAP committed to remodeling the airport facilities.The air traffic control is managed by the Peruvian Corporation of Airports and Commercial Aviation (CORPAC). The Peruvian government engaged Jaime Malagón, Jerome Jakubik, Paul Slocomb, and Víctor M. Marroquín of Baker and McKenzie international law firm, to oversee the changes.

In February 2005, the first phase of remodeling of the terminal was completed, which included the total renovation of the existing infrastructure, the construction of the Peru Plaza Shopping Center and the new concourse with 18 boarding gates, 7 of which have boarding bridges . In June 2007, a four-star hotel, Ramada Costa del Sol, opened at the airport, whose building is directly connected to the passenger terminal by an elevated pedestrian bridge.

In January 2009, the second phase of the terminal expansion was commenced. The terminal has 28 gates, 19 with boarding bridges. In August 2009, the LAP announced that in 2010, the airport would have a new category III instrument landing system to help with landing in foggy conditions. Arquitectonica, a Miami-based architectural office, and Lima Airport Partners planned a second terminal and expansion of the main terminal.

=== New terminal ===
On October 24, 2018, the Peruvian state delivered all the land for the expansion and modernization of the Jorge Chavez airport to the airport operator &quot;Lima Airport Partners&quot;.
The estimated investment of US$1,200 million includes the construction of a new runway, a control tower and a passenger terminal in addition to the existing one. On the other hand, the state will build a new bridge and highway on the current Santa Rosa Avenue that will connect directly with the &quot;Costa Verde&quot; highway, benefiting a lot of tourists and entrepreneurs who are only going to visit Miraflores and the south. Works was to be completed in 4 years, by the beginning of the year 2023, and will allow the transit of 40 million passengers per year by 2030. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, work was delayed but continued in 2021. The new terminal will be completed on 30 March 2025.

==Facilities==

=== Hotels ===

The airport hosts the Wyndham Costa del Sol hotel, which is located adjacent to the control tower and the arrivals exit. The hotel is built with noise canceling panels. The hotel was inauguration on 12 June 2007. 

The Peru Plaza Shopping Center is located near the passenger terminal in the Grand Concourse area. The food court is located near the entrance of the passenger terminal on the second floor and is always open. There is also an ice cream vendor selling some special Peruvian flavours such as chirimoya and lucuma.

=== VIP Lounges ===
The airport has numerous premium lounges in the departures terminal, such as VIP Peru. For passengers in first class, there is an exclusive salon near the gates, the VIP Club. Some lounges include, Salón VIP Perú, Salón VIP Club and Salón Sumaq VIP Lounge.

In 2010, for the second consecutive year, the Sumaq VIP Lounge, part of the international Priority Pass lounge chain, was named Lounge of the Year worldwide, based on a vote made by the chain&#x27;s users.

=== Tourist information ===
For tourist information, Iperú modules are available, located at national and international arrivals and national and international departures. There, free information material is distributed as well as information about the main tourist destinations in Peru.

=== Cargo ===
As part of the Jorge Chávez International Airport Master Plan, Lima Airport Partners inaugurated the new Air Cargo and Mail Center facilities in 2007. Additionally, the company Frío Aéreo inaugurated a refrigerated cargo warehouse, which handles perishable exports. Later, the complex called Lima Cargo City was built and annexed, an important new logistics center adjacent to the airport, which required an investment of 35 million dollars and was designed to house the main air cargo operators. On 12 May 2009 Lima Cargo City was opened.

==Transport==

Transportation between the airport and the city is provided by taxis, tour buses and vans. Airport Express Lima is the official bus of Jorge Chávez Airport. Line 2 and Line 4 of the Lima Metro are currently under construction. Some companies of taxis and buses offer services to visit the city, some of them transit through the avenues: Faucett, Linea Amarilla, Tomás Valle, De La Marina, Colonial and Costa Verde. Some go north, east, to the historic center and the Financial Center; and others towards Miraflores and the south area like Pachacamac and Surco.

For safety reasons, it is advisable to only take taxis from companies that are located in the national or international arrivals area. You can also request taxi service via smartphone applications, which are secure and have standard rates. There is also the possibility of renting cars, contacting companies also located at international arrivals. They commonly travel through Elmer Faucett Avenues, La Marina Avenue (connects with the districts of southern Lima and those with high hotel offerings such as San Isidro and Miraflores), Tomás Valle (connects with Lima Norte, Lima Este, Rimac and with the Historic Center), Javier Prado, Pan-American Highway North, South, Vía de Evitamiento and Yellow Line.

Connections to the new airport remain unbuilt despite its planned opening in March 2025. The government did not build bridges across the Rímac River, leaving dead-end roads near where a proposed highway is supposed to connect in another three years. Temporary bridges allow access to private cars, but there is no pedestrian access or scheduled bus service as of February 2025. The new Line 4 of the Lima and Callao Metro, expected to open in 2028, will have a station near the old terminal but there are not plans to connect the new airport; the Airport station will be renamed to prevent confusion.

==Accidents and incidents==
* November 27, 1962: Varig Flight 810, a Boeing 707-441 registration PP-VJB flying from Rio de Janeiro to Jorge Chávez International Airport, after initiating an overshoot procedure at the suggestion of the control tower because it was too high, proceeded to start another approach when it crashed into La Cruz peak, from the airport. Possibly there was a misinterpretation of navigation instruments. All 97 passengers and crew aboard died.
* May 8, 1964: an Argentine Air Force Douglas C-54 registration T-47 flying from Buenos Aires to Jorge Chávez International Airport crashed into a sand dune during approach in poor visibility conditions, killing 46 of the 49 people on board.
* August 6, 1986: an explosion of unknown origin occurred at a restroom in the domestic terminal.
* December 8, 1987: a Peruvian Navy Fokker 27-400M registration AE-560 flying from Pucallpa to Jorge Chávez International Airport chartered by the Alianza Lima football team crashed into the Pacific Ocean shortly before landing. A malfunctioning cockpit indicator made the crew believe that the landing gear was not properly deployed and locked, so they requested the control tower to allow the plane to make a low pass for a visual check by ground personnel. After receiving the confirmation that the landing gear was down, the aircraft circled the airport for another attempt to land, but plunged into the ocean instead, killing all on board except the pilot.
* March 10, 1989: an Aero Condor Britten-Norman BN-2A Islander registration OB-1271 flying from Nazca to Jorge Chavez International Airport crashed into a building during approach killing all on board, apparently due to fuel exhaustion.
* January 25, 1991: a car bomb placed by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) killed two Peruvians and wounded ten people. The attack occurred in a context of condemnation, by left-wing armed groups and political movements, of Operation Desert Storm; minutes after the attack, the US Embassy in Lima was attacked with an RPG and small arms fire by the MRTA.
* July 24, 1992: five American Airlines employees, charged with cleaning and baggage loading duties, were wounded by a bomb. This happened during the weekend in which Shining Path enforced a 48-hour nationwide &quot;armed strike&quot; that aimed at paralyzing, among other services, public transportation. 
* January 22, 1993: three bullets hit the right side of the fuselage of American Airlines Flight 917 (inbound from Miami) while either landing or taxiing on the runway after landing. There were no casualties and damage to the plane was minimal. Despite Shining Path (SP) claiming responsibility for the attack, a subsequent investigation failed to identify the actual assailants. Airport authorities reportedly stated that the source of the shots was accidental, originating in a security guard working in the perimeter. The incident, occurring in the context of a decade-long leftist insurgency against the Peruvian state, happened in the midst of a surge of terrorist attacks and assassinations during that month, which also targeted US interests and businesses.
* April 15, 1995: an Imperial Air Tupolev Tu-134A-3 registration OB-1553 flying from Cusco to Jorge Chavez International Airport suffered a tire failure after departure. The crew decided to continue the flight to Lima, but the left main landing gear did not extend during landing. There were no fatalities, but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
* October 2, 1996: Flight 603, an Aeroperú Boeing 757-23A registration N52AW flying the Miami–Lima–Santiago route crashed into the Pacific Ocean some minutes after its takeoff from Jorge Chávez International Airport, killing all on board. The accident investigation found that masking tape was accidentally left over the static ports during maintenance, rendering the airspeed indicator, altimeter and vertical speed indicator unreliable.
* On December 13, 2003, at 22:48 local time, Aero Continente Flight 341, a Boeing 737-200 (registered OB-1544-P) operating from Caracas to Lima, belly-landed at the runway because the pilots had forgotten about lowering the landing gear since they had to cope with a problem concerning the flaps. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair, but all 94 passengers and six crew on board survived the accident.
* On October 11, 2013, an Airbus A320 (registration N492TA) from TACA Airlines, made an emergency landing at 8:20 am Local Time. The pilot declared an emergency due to smoke in the cockpit. The aircraft was en route from Jorge Chávez International Airport to El Salvador International Airport, San Salvador, El Salvador. There were 31 passengers plus crew on board. The aircraft landed safely.
* On November 18, 2022, a LATAM Peru A320neo taking off as Flight 2213 to Juliaca collided with a fire engine that was crossing the runway, killing two firefighters and injuring a third. All 102 passengers and 6 crew aboard the plane escaped unharmed.

<doc id="102001" wikidata="Q812025" url="?curid=102001" title="Baw Baw National Park">
<text>The Baw Baw National Park () is a national park located on the boundary between the Victorian Alps and Gippsland regions of Victoria, Australia. The national park is situated approximately east of Melbourne and north of the Latrobe Valley. The park contains the forest covered Baw-Baw Plateau and surrounds the Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort.

The Baw-Baw Plateau has a number of peaks, that includes Mount Baw Baw, Mount St Gwinear, Mount St Phillack, Mount Erica and Mount Whitelaw; all largely subalpine terrane outcrops of weathered granite boulders rising from the plateau, which is covered by a forest of snow-gums, punctuated by meadows. Mount St Phillack, a granite hill on the Baw-Baw plateau standing at above sea level is the park&#x27;s highest peak as the slightly higher Mt Baw Baw peak is part of the ski resort area. The slopes of the plateau within the national park form the catchment areas for the Thomson River and the Thomson Reservoir, and the Tanjil and Tyers rivers.

==History==
The traditional custodians of the land surrounding Baw Baw National Park are the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation. Through their cultural traditions, the Gunaikurnai people identify the Baw Baw National Park as their traditional country.

The area was first explored by Europeans in 1860 by botanist Ferdinand von Mueller, and he named the peaks Mount Mueller and Mount Erica after himself. Mueller also used this trip as a way to clarify his theories about the similarities and differences in vegetation in Tasmania and Victoria. The area was settled in the 1880s and 1890s, after the discovery of gold in the area. Baw Baw National Park was declared in April 1979. On 7 November 2008 the park was added to the Australian National Heritage List as one of eleven areas constituting the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves. The Baw Baw National Park represents the southerly extent of the sub-alpine environment on mainland Australia.

== Geography ==
Baw Baw typically consists of regions with low lying grasses, snow gums, and heathlands .The Australian Alps also have a magnitude of mushroom rock, as well as giant granite towering over the forest.

==Flora and fauna==

The typical vegetation in the park is low-lying grasses, heathlands and snow gums, this is typically described as sub-alpine. Fauna abounds on the foothills to Baw Baw Plateau, including Leadbeater&#x27;s possum, which is now critically endangered as of 2015, due to the &quot;Saturday Bushfires&quot; impact on their population and habitat. The Leadbeater&#x27;s possum is also Victoria&#x27;s state fauna emblem. The critically endangered Baw Baw frog (&quot;Philoria frosti&quot;), listed on the IUCN Red List, population has started to disappear from its earlier range, and is now limited to a small range on the Mount Baw Baw Plateau.

The deciduous Baw Baw berry (&quot;Wittsteinia vacciniacea&quot;) may be found on the plateau. It is a red and yellow flower species, and is the only species of Wittsteinia in Australia. It is also one of four genera in the Alseuosmiaceae family. The berry is scattered throughout the mountainous region of Victoria, and its population within these regions vary.

The Epracis breviflora, or drumstick heaths flowering time is from November to January. This flower is native to the Baw Baw Plateau, and also occasionally found in moist crevices in rocks on the mountain as well. 
== Climate ==
The overnight temperature minimums fall between 6 and 13 degrees celsius on average. The mean annual rainfall in this region is 606-2344 mm, with a monthly average minimum of 44-126 mm, and a monthly average maximum of 63-295 mm 

==Etymology==
The national park draws its name from Mount Baw Baw. In the Australian Aboriginal Woiwurrung language the name for the mountain was thought to be variously &quot;bo-ye&quot;, meaning &quot;ghost&quot;; or &quot;bo-bo&quot;, meaning bandicoot. In the Bunurong language, the mountain was thought to be named &quot;Bore Bore&quot; and in the Gunai language, &quot;Bo Bo&quot;, both meaning &quot;echo&quot;.

==Activities==
The major uses of the park are skiing in winter and bushwalking in summer. It is popular for cross country skiing, downhill skiing, summer bushwalking, rafting and canoeing, fishing, scenic drives and picnics. The Australian Alps Walking Track traverses its entire length, starting at Walhalla and continuing north towards the Alpine National Park. The Baw Baw section takes a bit less than three days to walk with plenty to see for those interested in botany or geology.

There is popular ski touring along the Baw Baw Plateau between Mount Baw Baw, past Mount St Phillack to Mount St Gwinear. There is a volunteer ski patrol group who run on weekends and patrol around the St Gwinear portion of the national park. They access the park from the opposite side of the plateau to the ski resort at Mount Baw Baw. Other popular skiing is Nordic skiing at Mount Baw Baw, introduced in 1972 including championship races and a ski school.

<doc id="102002" wikidata="Q310775" url="?curid=102002" title="Jean-Claude Duvalier">
<text>Jean-Claude Duvalier (; 3 July 19514 October 2014), nicknamed &quot;Baby Doc&quot; (, ), was a Haitian dictator who inherited the President of Haiti from 1971 until he was overthrown by a popular uprising in February 1986. He succeeded his father François &quot;Papa Doc&quot; Duvalier as the ruler of Haiti after his death in 1971. After assuming power, he introduced cosmetic changes to his father&#x27;s regime and delegated much authority to his advisors. Thousands of Haitians were tortured and killed, and hundreds of thousands fled the country during his presidency. He maintained a notoriously lavish lifestyle (including a state-sponsored US$2million wedding in 1980) while poverty among his people remained the most widespread of any country in the Western Hemisphere.

Relations with the United States improved after Duvalier&#x27;s ascension to the presidency, and later deteriorated under the Carter administration, only to normalize under Ronald Reagan due to the strong anti-communist stance of the Duvaliers. Rebellion against the Duvalier regime broke out in 1985, and Duvalier fled to France in 1986 on a U.S. Air Force flight.

Duvalier unexpectedly returned to Haiti on 16 January 2011, after two decades in self-imposed exile in France. The following day, he was arrested by Haitian police, facing possible charges for embezzlement. On 18 January, Duvalier was charged with corruption. On 28 February 2013, Duvalier pleaded not guilty to charges of corruption and human rights abuse. He died of a heart attack on 4 October 2014, at the age of 63.

Transparency International determined that the money embezzled by Duvalier was the sixth most embezzled by a sitting head of government between 1984 and 2004.

==Early life==
The son of Simone Ovide, a Mulatto-Haitian woman, and François Duvalier, a black nationalist anti-mulatto leader who became dictator of Haiti, Duvalier was born in Port-au-Prince and was brought up in an isolated environment. He attended Nouveau College Bird and Institution Saint-Louis de Gonzague. Later, he studied law at the University of Haiti under the direction of several professors, including Maître Gérard Gourgue.

==President of Haiti==
In April 1971, he assumed the presidency of Haiti at the age of 19 upon the death of his father, François Duvalier (nicknamed &quot;Papa Doc&quot;), becoming the world&#x27;s youngest president, as well as the only non-royal state leader under the age of 20. Initially, Jean-Claude Duvalier resisted the dynastic arrangement that had made him Haiti&#x27;s leader, having preferred that the presidency go to his older sister Marie-Denise Duvalier. He was content to leave substantive and administrative matters in the hands of his mother, Simone Ovide Duvalier, and a committee led by Luckner Cambronne, his father&#x27;s Interior Minister, while he attended ceremonial functions and lived as a playboy.

Duvalier was invested with absolute power by the constitution. He took some steps to reform the regime, by releasing some political prisoners and easing press censorship. However, there were no substantive changes to the regime&#x27;s basic character. Opposition was not tolerated, and the legislature remained a rubber stamp.

Much of the Duvaliers&#x27; wealth came from the Régie du Tabac (Tobacco Administration). Duvalier used this &quot;non-fiscal account&quot;, established decades earlier, as a tobacco monopoly, but he later expanded it to include the proceeds from other government enterprises and used it as a slush fund for which no balance sheets were ever kept.

By neglecting his role in government, Duvalier squandered considerable domestic and foreign goodwill and facilitated the dominance of Haitian affairs by a clique of hardline Duvalierist cronies, the so-called &quot;dinosaurs&quot;. Foreign officials and observers also seemed tolerant toward Duvalier in areas such as human rights monitoring and foreign countries were more generous to him with economic assistance. The Nixon administration restored the United States aid program for Haiti in 1971.

===Marriage===
On 27 May 1980, Duvalier married divorcee Michèle Bennett in a wedding that cost US$2million. The extravagance of the couple&#x27;s wedding was criticized both by Haitian dissidents and the international press; though &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; reported that &quot;the event... was enthusiastically received by a majority of Haitians&quot;. Discontent among the business community and elite intensified in response to increased corruption among the Duvaliers and the Bennett family&#x27;s dealings, which included selling Haitian cadavers to foreign medical schools and trafficking in narcotics. Increased political repression added to the volatility of the situation.

The marriage also estranged the old-line Duvalierists in the government from the younger technocrats whom Duvalier had appointed, including Jean-Marie Chanoine, Frantz Merceron, Frantz-Robert Estime and Theo Achille. The Duvalierists&#x27; spiritual leader, Duvalier&#x27;s mother, Simone Ovide Duvalier, was eventually expelled from Haiti, reportedly at the request of Michèle. With his wife Duvalier had two children, François Nicolas and Anya.
Over time, Michèle grew to become a power in her own right. For example, she dressed down ministers at cabinet meetings while her husband dozed.

===Destabilisation===
In response to an outbreak of African swine fever virus on the island in 1978, U.S. agricultural authorities insisted upon total eradication of Haiti&#x27;s pig population in 1982. The Program for the Eradication of Porcine Swine Fever and for the Development of Pig Raising (PEPPADEP) spread already-serious economic devastation among the peasant population, who bred pigs as an investment.

In addition, reports that HIV/AIDS was becoming a major problem in Haiti caused tourism to decline dramatically in the early 1980s. By the mid-1980s, most Haitians expressed hopelessness and despair, as economic conditions further worsened and hunger and malnutrition spread.

Widespread discontent began manifesting further in March 1983, when Pope John Paul II visited Haiti. The pontiff declared that &quot;things must change in Haiti&quot;, and he called on &quot;all those who have power, riches and culture so that they can understand the serious and urgent responsibility to help their brothers and sisters&quot;. He called for a more equitable distribution of income, a more egalitarian social structure, and increased popular participation in public life. This message revitalized both laymen and clergy, contributed to increased popular mobilization and expanded political and social activism.

A revolt began in the provinces in 1985. The city of Gonaïves was the first to have street demonstrations and raids on food-distribution warehouses. From October 1985 to January 1986, the protests spread to six other cities, including Cap-Haïtien. By the end of that month, Haitians in the south had revolted. The most significant rioting there broke out in Les Cayes.

Duvalier responded with a 10 percent cut in staple food prices, the closing of independent radio stations, a cabinet reshuffle, and a crackdown by police and army units, but these moves failed to dampen the momentum of the popular uprising against the dynastic dictatorship. Duvalier&#x27;s wife and advisers, intent on maintaining their grip on power, urged him to put down the rebellion and remain in office.

===Departure===

In January 1986, the Reagan administration began to pressure Duvalier to renounce his rule and to leave Haiti. Representatives appointed by Jamaican prime minister Edward Seaga served as intermediaries who carried out the negotiations. At this point a number of Duvalierists and business leaders met with the Duvaliers and pressed for their departure. The United States rejected a request to provide asylum for Duvalier, but offered to assist with their departure. On 30 January 1986, Duvalier had initially accepted, and President Reagan actually announced his departure based on a report from the Haitian CIA Station Chief who saw Duvalier&#x27;s car head for the airport. Duvalier&#x27;s party returned to the palace unnoticed by the U.S. intelligence team due to their motorcade being blocked by a gun battle. Duvalier declared &quot;we are as firm as a monkey tail&quot; and decided against abdication. However, the Duvaliers made another attempt to depart on 7 February 1986, this time succeeding, flying to France in a U.S. Air Force aircraft.

==Exile==
The Duvaliers settled in France. For a time they lived a luxurious life, but eventually separated on 19 June 1990. Although he formally applied for political asylum, his request was denied by French authorities. Duvalier lost most of his wealth with his 1993 divorce from his wife.

In his years of exile, Duvalier made no known attempts to find employment or gain self-employment, nor did he ever try to get a book written about his experience. &quot;All I know about is politics&quot;, he was quoted when asked about the lack of effort. Duvalier did take some courses at a university in France in an effort to sharpen his leadership skills.

A private citizen, named Jacques Samyn, unsuccessfully sued to expel Duvalier as an illegal immigrant (the Duvaliers were never officially granted asylum in France). In 1998, a Haitian-born photographer, Gérald Bloncourt, formed a committee in Paris to bring Duvalier to trial. At the time, the French Ministry of the Interior said that it could not verify whether Duvalier still remained in the country due to the recently enacted Schengen Agreement, which had abolished systematic border controls between France and the other participating countries. However, Duvalier&#x27;s lawyer Sauveur Vaisse said that his client was still in France and denied that the exiled leader had fallen on hard times.

The 2004 &quot;Global Corruption Report&quot; listed Duvalier as the sixth-most corrupt world leaderbetween Slobodan Milošević and Alberto Fujimorihaving amassed between US$300million and US$800million.

Following the ousting of president Jean-Bertrand Aristide in February 2004, Duvalier announced his intention to return to Haiti to run for president in the 2006 elections for the National Unity Party; however, he did not become a candidate.

While apparently living modestly in exile, Duvalier did have supporters, who founded the François Duvalier Foundation in 2006 to highlight positive aspects of the Duvalier presidency, including the creation of most of Haiti&#x27;s state institutions and improved access to education for the country&#x27;s black majority.

On 22–23 September 2007, an address by Duvalier to Haitians was broadcast by radio. Although he said exile had &quot;broken&quot; him, he also said that what he described as the improving fortunes of the National Unity Party had &quot;reinvigorated&quot; him, and he urged readiness among his supporters, without saying whether he intended to return to Haiti. President René Préval rejected Duvalier&#x27;s apology and, on 28 September, he said that, while Duvalier was constitutionally free to return to Haiti, he would face trial if he did so. Duvalier&#x27;s radio broadcast address was given in French and not Haitian Creole, the language spoken by the majority of Haitians.

In February 2010, a Swiss court agreed to release more than US$4million to Duvalier, although the Swiss Foreign Ministry said it would continue to block the release of the money.

Duvalier lived in Paris with Véronique Roy, his longtime companion, until his return to Haiti in late January 2011.

==Return and death==
On 16 January 2011, during the presidential election campaign, Duvalier returned to Haiti after 25 years. Accompanied by Roy, he flew in from Paris, indicating that he wanted to help: &quot;I&#x27;m not here for politics. I&#x27;m here for the reconstruction of Haiti&quot;, he said. However, many argued that Duvalier returned to Haiti to gain access to the US$4million frozen in his Swiss bank account. Haiti also claimed this money, arguing that the assets were of a &quot;criminal origin&quot; and should not be returned to Duvalier. Under Swiss law, however, states claiming money in Switzerland have to demonstrate that they have started criminal investigations against offenders holding money in the country. According to an article by Ginger Thompson in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;if Mr. Duvalier had been able to slip into the country and then quietly leave without incident... he may have been able to argue that Haiti was no longer interested in prosecuting him—and that the money should be his.&quot; According to Mac McClelland of &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine:

The former dictator was greeted at the Port-au-Prince airport with cheering and celebratory chanting ... The word from Duvalier is that he&#x27;s come to help his country. According to everyone on the street and on the radio, the Americans and the French conspired to bring him here to upset current president René Préval, who&#x27;s been accused of fixing his country&#x27;s recent elections.

On 18 January 2011, he was taken into custody at his hotel by Haitian authorities. He was charged with corruption, theft, and misappropriation of funds committed during his 15-year presidency. He was released but was subject to recall by the court.

By 22 September 2011, legal procedures against him appeared to have stalled. He was reported to be living under poorly enforced house arrest, enjoying a life of luxury in a suburb of Port-au-Prince. By 30 January 2012, it was announced that the former president would face charges of corruption, but not of human rights abuses.

After the former president failed to appear for three previously scheduled court hearings, a Haitian judge issued a warrant ordering him to appear before the court 28 February 2013. Duvalier did so and for the first time pleaded not guilty to charges of corruption and human rights abuse.

On 4 October 2014, Duvalier died of a heart attack at the age of 63.

<text>The Brisbane Ranges National Park is a national park in the Barwon South West region of Victoria, Australia, The national park is situated approximately west of Melbourne near the town of and is managed by Parks Victoria. The park covers part of the Brisbane Ranges, an area of hills of moderate elevation.

==Features==
The park features a number of walking tracks, of which the walk through Anakie Gorge is the most popular. Other attractions include the Ted Errey Nature Circuit and Wadawurrung walk. Relatively flat and suitable for those of moderate fitness, the walk features views of the Gorge itself and the presence of koalas and wallabies in their wild state. Some of the resident wallabies are relatively unafraid of tourists and may often study the passing visitors.

In January 2006, lightning sparked a bushfire in the Steiglitz historical area which soon spread throughout the Brisbane Ranges. Despite lengthy efforts to control the fire from Department of Sustainability and Environment, Parks Victoria and the Country Fire Authority fire fighters, the blaze incinerated of parkland and destroyed two houses without loss of human life. A subsequent bushfire one year later also threatened much of the national park.

<doc id="102007" wikidata="Q1073037" url="?curid=102007" title="Chiltern-Mt Pilot National Park">
<text>The Chiltern-Mt Pilot National Park is a national park that is located in the Hume region of Victoria, Australia. The national park is situated approximately northeast of Melbourne, and extends west from Beechworth across the Hume Freeway and the Albury-Melbourne railway line to the west of Chiltern.

The park was established under the to protect a diverse range of threatened species and ecosystems. The distinctive features of the park include the Woolshed Falls, picturesque Mt Pilot summit, culturally significant Aboriginal rock art at Yeddonba and historical relics of the goldmining era scattered throughout. The park is used for a number of recreational activities including bushwalking, hiking, trail riding, rock climbing, picnicking, camping, bird watching and prospecting.

== Background ==

=== History ===

At the time of European settlement, box-ironbark forests covered approximately or 13% of Victoria. As a result of settlement, nearly 80% of these forests were cleared and the remaining areas were badly degraded by grazing. The forests of the Chiltern-Mt Pilot National Park are living testament to these claims with some of its natural systems deteriorated as a result of grazing, clearing, logging and mining.

When gold was discovered in the area during the mid-1800s, extensive alluvial and reef mining, quartz mining and gravel quarrying began. Fossicking, prospecting and gem hunting are still permitted within the park today. Evidence of these activities including disturbed ground, mullock heaps, dams and old mineshafts may be found scattered throughout the park.

Pastoralists driving cattle through Chiltern, known at the time as Black Dog Creek, discovered the forests of box and ironbark during the 1930s. The species were renowned for their strong durable timber and soon felled for fencing, construction and firewood. In fact, firewood collection continued until 2002 when the National Park was formed. A landscape that was originally dominated by large, mature trees and grassy forest floors quickly deteriorated into closely packed stands of multi-stemmed coppice regrowth.

The clearing of land for agriculture and grazing impacted negatively on this landscape. Grazing continued through the Chiltern section of the park until the 1980s and the Mt Pilot section until the 1990s. Common problems associated with these activities including the introduction of pest species, soil compaction and erosion, increased salinity and habitat fragmentation were all reported as a result.

=== Park establishment ===

The Chiltern-Mt Pilot National Park is an amalgamation of two separate parks, each with distinct geological, historical and ecological profiles.

The Chiltern Regional Park, first known as the Chiltern State Park, was a Box-ironbark forest that was reserved in 1980 following the 1977 Land Conservation Council (LCC) recommendations. The Mt Pilot Multipurpose Park was also established under the 1977 LCC recommendations. The Environment Conservation Council (ECC) replaced the LCC in 1997 and gave rise to the Chiltern Box-ironbark National Park of .

When the Victorian State parliament gave assent to the it initiated the creation of a highly protected system of parks and reserves. The Chiltern Box-ironbark National Park and the Mt Pilot Multipurpose Park, in addition to Woolshed falls and surrounding land, were brought together to form Chiltern-Mt Pilot National Park as it is known today.

== Ecology ==

The Chiltern-Mt Pilot National Park falls within the Victorian Riverina and Northern Inland Slopes sub-bioregions. The Chiltern section of the park comprises low-lying hills formed from Ordovician sedimentary rock which are distinctly contrast to the rugged Devonian granite of the Mt Pilot section. The park protects a total 18 ecological vegetation classes (EVCs) of which four are threatened: Box-Ironbark, Spring-soak Woodland, Gilgai Plain Woodland/Wetland Mosaic and the Valley Grassy Forest. The park supports over 600 native species of flora and has the most intact assemblage of fauna with more birds, mammals and reptiles recorded than any other Box-ironbark forest. Most notably, the Chiltern-Mt Pilot National Park provides a critical habitat for the recovery of the barking owl (&quot;Ninox connivens&quot;) and brush-tailed phascogale (&quot;Phascogale tapoatafa&quot;). It is part of the Warby–Chiltern Box–Ironbark region Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for the conservation of Box–Ironbark forest ecosystems and several species of threatened woodland birds dependent on them.

=== Fauna ===

The park supports a diverse range of native fauna with 276 different species of mammals, birds and reptiles being reported. As well as common species including the grey kangaroo (&quot;Macropus giganteus&quot;), koala (&quot;Phascolarctos cinereus&quot;) and laughing kookaburra (&quot;Dacelo novaeguineae&quot;), the park is home to 43 fauna species listed as threatened; 21 one of which are listed under the &quot;Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988&quot;. Some significant species are described in more detail below.

====Squirrel glider====
The squirrel glider (&quot;Petaurus norfolcensis&quot;) is a small to medium-sized arboreal marsupial that occupies a vast range of habitats throughout Eastern Australia. It is listed as a threatened species under the &quot;FFG Act 1988&quot;. The gliders have highly specific feeding and nesting requirements and use trees to move through the landscape. Consequently, they are highly susceptible to changes in forest conditions. Squirrel gliders have a reported home range size of approximately in northeast Victoria. This size can vary greatly and is strongly influenced by the availability of food and the quality of the forest habitat. The glider&#x27;s diet consists of arthropods, nectars and insect exudates with foraging accounting for a high proportion of their nocturnal activity. Most of their time is spent in living eucalypt trees with a strong preference for large, mature trees in flower. Gliders use dead trees to shelter in and facilitate movement through the forest.

====Brush-tail phascogale====
Brush-tail phascogales (&quot;Phascogale tapoatafa&quot;) are small carnivorous, arboreal marsupials that are solitary by nature. They breed once per year with all males dying at the end of each breeding season. These mammals are widely distributed across Australia but habitat loss and degradation following European settlement in Victoria has meant this species is now listed as threatened. The average home range size for females is and for males it often exceeds .

Phascogales are regarded as foraging generalists with invertebrates comprising the bulk of their diet. Foraging in trees accounts for up to 90% of their nocturnal activity with larger trees offering greater surface areas for phascogales to forage on. Large remnant trees also contain more hollows and potential nest sites than smaller trees. Phascogales typically occupy living trees of large diameter and it is not uncommon for them to maintain multiple nests across the majority of their home range. For these reasons, sites that offer mature, evenly spaced trees and well connected patches are considered the most suitable habitats.

====Barking owl====
The barking owl (&quot;Ninox connivens&quot;) is listed as threatened under the &quot;Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act&quot;. It is one of the largest native predators remaining in southern Australia and renowned for its unique prey holding behaviour. As a predator, the owls have comparatively low abundance and require a constant source of high-energy food which makes them particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation and degradation. This highly territorial species has an average home range of approximately and requires large trees to maintain diurnal roosts. With one of the largest body sizes of any hollow-depended species in Australia, mature trees are essential to provide cavities big enough for nesting. A combination of drought and brushfire over the past ten years has led to a significant reduction in the number of breeding pairs residing in the Mt Pilot area. The Chiltern-Mt Pilot National Park is now a critical habitat for the recovery of this species.

====Regent honeyeater====
Populations of regent honeyeaters (&quot;Xanthomyza phrygia&quot;) were historically concentrated in three locations around Adelaide, northeast Victoria and central-east New South Wales, but are now locally extinct in South Australia. They are considered to be nationally endangered with a population of approximately 1500 individuals remaining. The honeyeater typically inhabits eucalypt woodland and dry open forests. Their diets consist principally of insects and nectar and are occasionally supplemented with fruits. Honeyeaters observed in northeast Victoria demonstrate a preference for box-ironbark forest, particularly the nectar from yellow gum (&quot;Eucalyptus leucoxylon&quot;) and winter flowering red ironbark (&quot;Eucalyptus tricarpa&quot;).

====Other species====
In addition to the species described above, the Chiltern-Mt Pilot National Park is home to a number of other significant fauna species. These include the painted honeyeater (&quot;Grantiella picta&quot;), swift parrot (&quot;Lathamus discolor&quot;), turquoise parrot (&quot;Neophema pulchella&quot;), square-tailed kite &quot;(Lophoictinia isura&quot;), spot-tailed quoll (&quot;Cinclosoma punctatum&quot;), bandy bandy (&quot;Vermicella annulata&quot;), woodland blind snake (&quot;Ramphotyphlops proximus&quot;) and brown toadlet (&quot;Pseudophryne bibronii&quot;).

=== Flora ===

The Chiltern-Mt Pilot National Park protects 42 threatened species of flora of which ten are listed under the . This includes a range of species such as the crimson spider orchid (&quot;Caladenia concolor&quot;), yellow hyacinth-orchid (&quot;Dipodium hamiltonianum&quot;), sturdy leek orchid (&quot;Prasophyllum validum&quot;), Warby swamp gum (&quot;Eucalyptus cadens&quot;), mountain swainson-pea (&quot;Swainsona recta&quot;) and the narrow goodenia (&quot;Goodenia macbarronii&quot;) that are listed as endangered or vulnerable in Victoria. Other significant flora species found within the park are described below.

====Red ironbark====
Red ironbark (&quot;Eucalyptus sideroxylon&quot;), also known as mugga ironbark, grows to a height of in open forests along the inland slopes of the Great Dividing Range in Victoria, New South Wales and southern Queensland. Flowering occurs throughout the year with seven small flower buds in umbels appearing in the axils of mature leaves. Small fruits measuring appear approximately one month after flowering. Leaf size is known to vary in response to environmental factors including water availability and soil composition. Both the swift parrot and regent honeyeater visit the park during winter to take advantage of the red ironbark&#x27;s peak flowering period.

====Black cypress pine====
The park has the largest reserved population of black cypress pine (&quot;Callitris endlicheri&quot;) in Victoria. The native conifer is commonly found in the hilly areas of southeast Australia where the climates are relatively warm and dry. The monoecious species is wind pollinated and described as having mostly erect branches, tough furrowed bark and dark green foliage. The species exhibits strong drought tolerance and an ability to survive in densely crowded strands though the rate of maturation can be slowed under these conditions. The pine is vulnerable to changes in rainfall and grazing pressure from rabbits and deer. The pine is highly susceptible to fire and mortality usually follows exposure. The Chiltern-Mt Pilot pine population was severely affected by the 2003 Eldorado fire. This places the species at greater risk of local extinction from future fires, particularly if two fires were to occur in close succession.

====Mt Pilot spider orchid====
The Mt Pilot spider orchid (&quot;Caladenia pilotensis&quot;) is a rare orchid species currently listed as threatened under the and endangered by the Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE). The species is described as having a hairy stem that grows to approximately in height, a single basal leaf and light green to yellow coloured flower with pale red shading. The deciduous herb originates from a population of approximately 100 individuals located inside a radius in the Mt-Pilot section of the park. It can be found in four small groups on the well-drained soils of the open grassy forest floor. Little is known about the ecology of this orchid but it is reported that pollination is severely restricted or absent in small populations. This problem is exacerbated by a decline in the rate of flowering as the eucalyptus forests recover from the 2003 bushfires. The risk of local extinction is high owing to the small population size and the threat of animal grazing, soil disturbance and weed invasion.

====Blakely’s red gum====
Blakely&#x27;s red gum (&quot;Eucalyptus blakelyi&quot;) is a common native Australian eucalypt found on the inland slopes of the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales and Victoria. The evergreen tree grows to a height of and flowers predominantly between November and December on a two to three-year cycle depending on environmental conditions. Seedling establishment is affected by common factors including temperature, light, litter accumulation, grazing, fire, frost and insect predation.

== Environmental threats ==

Northeast Victoria is susceptible to periodic natural disasters including fire, flood and drought. Major bushfires have occurred in the Chiltern-Mt Pilot National Park in 1899, 1912, 1927, 1940 and 2003. Bushfires in National Parks are likely to lead to the loss of conservation areas, significant species and communities and park infrastructure including toilet blocks, picnic areas, lookouts, car parks, signage and tracks. While some species benefit from burns through heat activated germination, others like the isolated populations of black cypress pine or Mount Pilot spider orchids may face local extinction.

Flood events and heavy rains have the potential to result in severe erosion given the park&#x27;s duplex soils and steep inclines. During flood events, contaminants such as mercury can be mobilised and transformed into chemicals that jeopardize the health of the park&#x27;s aquatic systems. It is likely that past mining practices have led to heavy metal contamination in the park&#x27;s waterways and sediments.

Pest plants including Blackberry (&quot;Rubus fruticosus&quot;), bridal creeper (&quot;Asparagus asparagoides&quot;), furze (&quot;Ulex europaeus&quot;) and paterson&#x27;s curse (&quot;Echium plantagineum&quot;) have been identified as problematic weeds within the park that pose a threat to native flora populations. St John&#x27;s Wort (&quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot;) and prickly pear &quot;(Opuntia ficus-indica&quot;) occurring in the Mt Pilot Range have been brought under control but continued management is required. Pest animals known to occur within the park include the red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), European rabbit &quot;(Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;) and feral cat (&quot;Felis catus&quot;). Foxes and cats pose serious predation risks to native fauna while rabbits impact on native flora and are notorious for the degree of soil disturbance caused by burrowing.

== Park management ==

=== Approach ===

The Chiltern Mt-Pilot National Park Management Plan was prepared in October 2008 in accordance with the . The plan outlines the park&#x27;s values and attractions and sets the basis and future direction for its long term management and protection. Key elements of the plan include the protection of threatened species and ecological communities, protection of Indigenous culture and history, invasive species management, sustainable recreation, tourism and support for community based management and participation.

The management plan was prepared by Parks Victoria using evidence from existing reports and studies of the area, a best practise approach and community consultation. The plan clearly articulates the park&#x27;s significance and values in terms of natural resources, culture, history, tourism and recreation as well as providing an extensive list of legislative requirements and ECC recommendations with which it complies. As a model for the management of landscape diversity, there is significant emphasis placed on conservation and protection through zoning. Zoning is said to reflect the park&#x27;s management priorities by assisting with the protection of sensitive and fragile environments and minimising the impact of potentially harmful activities.

=== Outcomes ===

A community based approach to natural resource management is reflected through collaborative partnerships with groups including Friends, Landcare and other volunteers who play an active role in monitoring and research activities. The Friends of Chiltern-Mt Pilot National Park Inc. report that a range of activities have been undertaken since 2009 including removal of weeds, tree planting, site maintenance, sign posting, monitoring of nesting boxes, release of captive bred species and counting of significant species.

<text>The Churchill National Park is a national park located in the Greater Melbourne region of Victoria, Australia. The national park is situated southeast of Melbourne adjacent to the suburb of , which lies between Rowville and Endeavour Hills in the far north of the City of Casey. The national park is near the Monash Freeway and Stud Road. When combined with the adjacent Lysterfield Park, the two parks comprise in the Dandenong Valley and the Dandenong Ranges that are a haven for native birds, mammals and reptiles, and provide recreational opportunities.

Established on 12 February 1941 as the Dandenong National Park, the park was renamed in 1944 in honour of Sir Winston Churchill.

Churchill National Park is about one and a half hours from Melbourne, Victoria.

==Features==

There are tracks throughout the Churchill National Park for walking, cycling and jogging. One recommended walking track for a very peaceful walk is Channel Track, surrounded by thick woodland and it runs beside the old aqueduct. The eastern boundary track is particularly good for cycling and jogging. Bird watching is spectacular within the park especially by the dam along the northern boundary track.

The picnic ground has gas barbecues, a unisex toilet and a shelter. Picnic grounds are provided on the end of the access road.

Churchill National Park is famous for its 173 different species of birds, such as the Australian wood duck and the Pacific black duck. Most mammals are only active at night, so if you arrive early or leave late, you might be lucky enough to see one, such as echidnas, wallabies and kangaroos. Echidnas are also active during the day, searching for ants and grubs in the ground.

==History==
The park that is now Churchill National Park was once the police corps headquarters for blacktrackers and provided grazing land for the police horses. Many years later it was known as the Dandenong Police Paddocks. In the 1920s, metropolitan development brought some change to the parklands, which was still known as Police Paddocks. Local stone was dug up for road metal and building material, a water supply channel was cut to Dandenong, and the State Electricity Commission obtained a power line easement. Fire and the clearing of the area took place. In 1939 the area was set aside as the Dandenong National Park, gazetted in February 1941, and later renamed Churchill National Park in 1944.

An old quarry is located in the northwest corner of the park, where remains of the associated tramway and crusher foundations are still visible. The tramway was known as the Scoresby Tramway. Constructed by the Dandenong Shire Council in 1912, it was used to transport crushed rock from the quarry. The wagons travelled by gravity for most of the distance; when the topography leveled out, horses were used to draw them. The quarry operated for approximately three years. The tramway was removed after the cessation of quarrying.

<text>The Croajingolong National Park is a coastal national park located in the East Gippsland region of the Australian state of Victoria. The national park is situated approximately east of Melbourne and south of Sydney.

The name &quot;Croajingolong&quot; derives from the Australian Aboriginal Krauatungalung words &quot;galung&quot;, meaning &quot;belonging to&quot; and &quot;kraua&quot;, meaning &quot;east&quot;.

==Location and features==
The park is linear in shape and bordered on the southern side by the Tasman Sea of the South Pacific Ocean, the western side by Bemm River and the eastern side by the township of Mallacoota. Its northern boundary consists of dense bushland and low hills. The dimensions of the park are approximately by , with an area of . The Wilderness Coast Walk stretches the entire length of the park along beaches, through heathland and round rocky headlands.

Croajingolong National Park, with the adjoining Nadgee Nature Reserve in New South Wales, forms one of only twelve World Biosphere areas in Australia. It contains ecosystems, habitats and gene pools that are managed sustainably. The park encloses the Sandpatch Wilderness Area and is contiguous with the Cape Howe Wilderness Area, the Nadgee Nature Reserve and the Cape Howe Marine National Park.

===Important Bird Area===
The eastern section of the park lies within the Nadgee to Mallacoota Inlet Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International because it supports populations of eastern bristlebirds and pilotbirds as well as other significant fauna.

==Visitor attractions==
Croajingolong&#x27;s landscapes are so spectacular and environmentally significant that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) nominated it a World Biosphere Reserve in 1977. The park houses impressive biodiversity, including almost 1,000 native plant species and 315 animal species.

The diverse coastal landscapes feature rocky outcrops, large stretches of sandy beaches, coastal dunes and freshwater rivers, making the park a popular destination for hiking and walking, swimming, diving, snorkelling and sea kayaking.

A popular way to explore the remote wilderness and diverse flora and fauna of the national park is on the Wilderness Coast Walk, which extends 45 kilometres from Thurra River camping area to Shipwreck Creek.

Popular destinations within the park include:
* Point Hicks and its lighthouse
* Tamboon Inlet resort town 
* Spectacular sand dunes at Thurra River
* Lake Elusive near Wingan Inlet
* Mount Everard
* Rame Head

Camping spots exist at Wingan Inlet, Shipwreck Creek and Peachtree Creek and are all accessible by car. The camp sites at Mueller Inlet and Thurra River are privately managed. Most campgrounds are equipped with picnic facilities and fireplaces.

Nearby towns are Mallacoota, Genoa, Cann River, Bemm River and Orbost.

<text>The Errinundra National Park is a national park located in the Gippsland region of Victoria, Australia. The national park is situated east of Melbourne via the Princes Highway and is centred on the Errinundra Plateau, a southwards extension of the Monaro Tablelands of New South Wales.

==Features==

The Errinundra National Park preserves the largest remaining cool temperate rainforest in Victoria and supports some of south eastern Australia&#x27;s most spectacular old growth forests. There are also many rare and threatened species of flora and fauna, including powerful owls, tiger quolls and long-footed potoroos.

Cool and warm temperate rainforest, wet open forest, montane forests and woodlands are the dominant vegetation communities. There is also a sub-alpine wetland.

The majority of the park is accessible only in the drier months. In winter, rain and snow generally make the unsealed roads impassable.

There has been extensive logging of all forest types surrounding the park including Brown Mountain forest and there have been some instances of logging within the national park&#x27;s boundaries due to administrative errors. In addition, logging occurred in many areas before the national park was established.

<text>French Island (Boonwurrung: &quot;Bellarmarin, Woone,&quot; or &quot;Jouap&quot;) sits within a tectonic depression known as the Western Port sunkland, and is the largest coastal island of Victoria, Australia.

In 1997, about 70% of the island was declared the French Island National Park, administered by Parks Victoria, and was listed in the former Register of the National Estate in 1984. The island is an unincorporated area under the direct administration of the government of Victoria, and is a declared locality of Victoria having its own postcode. Community issues are dealt with by the French Island Community Association. The island is otherwise administered by the Department of Transport and Planning. The population of the island in 2011 was around 116 people, of which about 60 were permanent residents. By 2021 the population on census night was recorded as 139 with a median age of 52 years.

Compared with Philip Island and areas on the surrounding mainland, French Island is isolated and undeveloped. There are no water mains, electricity mains, or medical services on the island. There is one small general store and post office located on Tankerton Road about from Tankerton Jetty. Many of the locals actively promote environmental tourism. Visitor accommodation includes camping, bed and breakfast, guesthouse and farmstay.

==History==
According to the French Island Community Association, prior to British colonisation, French Island was a hunting ground of the Bunurong people. They lived on the mainland and travelled to French Island to collect shellfish and swan eggs. There are several registered sites on the island that consist of shell middens and stone scatters they left behind.

In April 1802, a French expedition ship &quot;Naturaliste&quot; under Jacques Hamelin, part of the Baudin expedition to Australia, explored the area. Hamelin named the island Île de Françoise (Island of Francoise), which was corrupted as French Island.

The first recorded settlers on the island were William and John Gardiner in 1847, who had the first pastoral lease and grazed 8,000 sheep. The first land subdivision was in 1867 when were divided into 14 allotments. The first land sales took place in 1873 with the minimum price £1 per acre. In the 1880s, koalas were introduced to the island.

During the 1890s depression, the government encouraged settlement of the area and established seven village settlements on French Island under the Village Settlement Scheme. These were called Energy, Star of Hope, Callanan&#x27;s, Perseverance, Industrial, Kiernan&#x27;s and Grant Homestead Association. Altogether about 200 people made up these settlements. Tankerton Post Office opened on 3 September 1890 and remained open until 1994. It reopened in 2001 under the name French Island. A Fairhaven post office was also open from 1911 until 1957. Four schools were built of which the Perseverance Primary School, established in 1896, is the only one remaining and now caters for only a small number of primary school children.

John Ratford introduced chicory to the island, after he spent a season learning about it on Phillip Island in 1895. The Chicory industry became the main source of income on the island for over 70 years with extensive chicory planting and some 30 chicory kilns established. The last chicory crop was harvested in the 1980s. The Bayview chicory kiln, the second and now the oldest remaining on the island, was built in 1896-97 and is a cafe and museum.

McLeod prison farm opened on 17 July 1916 and occupied 222 hectares and operated as a self-sustaining farm. Timber cabins housed the prisoners until 1946 when concrete cells were built. The prison closed in 1975 and was used as a holiday camp facility until 1995. Later it operated as an eco-village until it was bought in 2017 for $4 million by a Chinese-based company with plans to turn it into a major tourism operation.

In 1967, at the request of state Premier Henry Bolte, the State Electricity Commission of Victoria proposed the island as the site of the first nuclear power plant in Australia; these plans were ultimately abandoned. During the 1960s and 1970s BHP, Hooker Rex and the State Electricity Commission paid inflated prices for land, inducing land owners to sell up and move off the island.

In July 1997, , about 70%, of the island was declared French Island National Park, and in May 2002 the waters directly north of French Island were declared the French Island Marine National Park.

==Access and transport==
===Ferry===
The main access to the island is the Western Port Ferries passenger ferry running several services daily from Stony Point pier to Tankerton Jetty and Cowes on Phillip Island. Metro Trains run a service to Stony Point railway station via Frankston railway station. Most trains arriving at Stony Point connect with the ferry service to both French Island and Phillip Island throughout the day. The ferry does not carry vehicles but car parking is provided on the Stony Point foreshore. The crossing takes about 15 minutes.

The French Island Barge Company operates a vehicular ferry from Corinella on the eastern side of Western Port to the barge landing on French Island. It accommodates two standard size cars or a larger truck. All supplies to the island come by the Barge, which runs every day of the year, depending on tide and appointments.

===Air===
There is no airport on the island, although a few properties have private landing strips.

===Road===
There are more than 40 km of unsealed gravel roads and tracks on the island, which are quiet and ideal for mountain bikes. They are affected by rain and can become dangerous for the inexperienced. The island is generally flat or mildly undulating with the highest point being Mount Wellington (96 m above sea level). Bicycles and cars can be hired from the general store. There is an abundance of walking tracks. Active pursuits include bushwalking, bird watching, horse riding, geocaching and cycling.

==Geography==
French Island has a few notable landforms, including:

* Mount Wellington – highest point on the island at about 96 m
* The Pinnacles – 66 m
* Harrop Hill
* Tortoise Head
* Spit Point

Watercourses on the island include:

* Tankerton Creek
* Redbill Creek
* Mosquito Creek
* Brella Creek

As the only community on the island, Tankerton is the only place on the island where necessities like food and cars can be obtained.

==Population==
At the 2021 census the French Island population consisted of 139 people, 49% of which were male and 51% of which were female. The median age was 52.

The island has a Primary School, on The Centre Way. In 2003 ten students were enrolled at the Perseverance Primary School.
In 2009 five students were enrolled at the primary school. According to ACARA, in 2011 there were nine enrolments In 2018, Perseverance Primary had seven students taught by one teacher and a teacher&#x27;s aide.

==Natural environment==
Habitats range from coastal mangroves, swamps, heath, grasslands and blue gum forests. Most koala populations on the mainland of Australia are affected by the chlamydia disease; however French Island provides the world&#x27;s densest and most disease-free population of koalas, with regular transfer of excess koalas to repopulate diseased areas on the mainland. Shelter is provided for more than 100 species of bush orchids, and 260 species of birds. Significant species on the island include: king quail, the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot, fairy tern, white-bellied sea eagle, swamp skink, long-nosed potoroo.

The island is one of only two places in Victoria where the invasive red fox is not present, which has enabled the island to maintain a variety of indigenous species which have been devastated by the predator elsewhere including Phillip Island. However rabbits, feral cats, feral goats, feral pigs, Indian mynahs and starlings pose a threat to the island&#x27;s biodiversity.

The Ross River virus has been identified on French Island.

==Camping==
There is one free camping site on French Island. It is located in the National Park at Fairhaven, 5 km up the coast road from Tankerton Jetty (where the ferry arrives from Stony Point). The campground is set among trees near the beach, with three public toilets and a water tank. While the site is free, advance booking is required. Other camping is available at &quot;private sites&quot; at French Island Eco Inn and through the local French Island tour operator.

==Proposed nuclear power plant site==
In mid 1967, the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) applied to the Lands Department for the reservation of of French Island for future construction of a nuclear power plant. The plant was speculated to have 350-500MW generator capacity and would likely have been built during the 1970s. Other plants around Australia were also envisioned after the construction of a successful, fully operational plant in Victoria. If the SECV did decide to construct a nuclear power station, it would have continued to construct brown coal power stations as well for some considerable time.

Due to the low cost of brown coal in Victoria and mounting pressure from the anti-nuclear movement, the SEC subsequently decided against commissioning a nuclear plant and instead continued the commissioning of brown coal plants. These included the Hazelwood Power Station, which was completed in 1971. Nuclear plants were not constructed in NSW as access to black coal allowed for bigger generators. The declaration of various areas of many Australian states as nuclear free zones was a key factor in the selection of coal plants over nuclear plants.

In 1982, the Cain Labor government in Victoria legislated to ban the building of nuclear power plants in the state. In 1985, the SECV announced that its land at Red Bluff would be transferred to the National Parks service. This took place at a time when ferry services to the island had become unreliable, with the two small vessels (King Fisher and Port Hunter) breaking down regularly. Because of the unreliability of access, land in the area was sold in 60 and 90 acre allotments for just $1,000 per acre.

<text>The Hattah-Kulkyne National Park is a national park in the Mallee district of Victoria, Australia. The national park is situated adjacent to the Murray River, approximately northwest of Melbourne with the nearest regional centre being Mildura. The Hattah Lakes National Park was proclaimed on , later being greatly expanded in 1980 and becoming the Hattah-Kulkyne National Park. It is a popular destination for bushwalkers and school camping trips.

==History==
In 1915, a sanctuary was formed to protect the beauty of the Hattah lakes. In 1949, ornithologist Les Chandler and the Reverend Clarrie Lang formed the Sunraysia Field Naturalists&#x27; Club (later the Sunraysia Naturalists&#x27; Research Trust). Les Chandler was variously its president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer and editor. They agitated to have the Hattah-Kulkyne area declared a national park, which was partially achieved in 1960, with the Hattah Lakes area becoming the Hattah Lakes National Park. The Kulkyne State Forest was added to the national park in 1980, resulting in the creation of the Hattah-Kulkyne National Park.

==Description==
The park is in the Mallee district, famous for its red dirt and mallee eucalypts. There are several lakes in the area, the largest of which is Lake Hattah. During the dry season most of the lakes and their streams dry out completely. Although there are limited road and tracks, there are several major high tension power and telegraph lines that run through or near the park, around which large areas are cleared. For management purposes, the Hattah-Kulkyne National Park is managed with the Murray-Sunset National Park, Wyperfeld National Park, Lake Albacutya Park and Murray-Kulkyne Park as part of the Victorian Mallee Parks.

==Important Bird Area==
Over 200 bird species have been recorded in the park, which is overlapped by the Murray-Sunset, Hattah and Annuello Important Bird Area (IBA), so identified by BirdLife International because it contains mallee habitat supporting a suite of threatened mallee bird, including the malleefowl, black-eared miner and mallee emu-wren.

<text>The Kinglake National Park is a national park in Central Victoria, Australia. The national park is situated northeast of Melbourne and includes tracks (some with wheelchair access), and camping facilities.

The national park includes Masons Falls, a picnic area with falls and natural flora. Layered sediment forms the valley, containing fossils from when the area was once covered by the sea. Natural fauna includes wallaby, kangaroo, wombat, possum and echidna. It also includes varieties of birds including cockatoos (sulphur-crested, black and red-headed), king parrots, the rosella and the lyrebird.

Prior to the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, the park was renowned for being home to the tallest tree in Victoria. The specimen of &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; (mountain ash) stood tall in 2002 and was suspected to have originated after the 1851 Black Thursday bushfires. It was located in the Wallaby Creek closed catchment area in the north-west regions of the park.

==History==
The area was logged in the early part of the 20th century, and some remnants of logging remain (such as scars on some trees and a sawdust dump).

In January 2006, parts of the park to the north of the township were devastated by a bushfire started by lightning during a severe thunderstorm. The blaze threatened to engulf the town, advancing to within a few hundred metres of the northern fringe. The town was saved by further thunderstorms, along with Country Fire Authority volunteers. In 2009 98% of the national park was severely burnt by the devastating Black Saturday bushfires. Much of the town of Kinglake was destroyed and nearly a hundred people died. As of 2010, rehabilitation work is continuing and sections of the park are gradually being reopened.

<text>The Lake Eildon National Park is a national park in the Central Highlands region of Victoria, Australia. The national park is set in the northern foothills of the Central Highlands, approximately northeast of Melbourne and abuts the shores of Lake Eildon.

==History==

The Goulburn River Valley supported a population of hundreds of members of the Aboriginal Australian group known as the Taungurung people. Cultural sites belonging to these people would have been flooded with the creation of Lake Eildon.

The park includes a number of mine shafts related to Victoria&#x27;s gold rush of the 1860s. The park also contains relics from early pastoral use.

In the 1950s, the Victorian Government purchased farming properties along the Goulburn and Delatite rivers for the construction of Lake Eildon to provide irrigation water for the Goulburn Valley. An area of that wasn&#x27;t flooded was declared Fraser National Park in 1957. An area of of state forest adjacent to the lake was reserved as Eildon State Park in 1980 to protect the catchment of Lake Eildon. In 1997, the two parks were combined to create Lake Eildon National Park.

==Geology==
The park is mountainous, with peaks up to , and includes the edge of the Cerberean Caldera, a Supervolcano around across which was active around 380 million years ago. The caldera is evident in a few places as granite outcrops. It is thought that the Cerberean Caldera underwent a super eruption 374 Mya, which in turn would have contributed to the Late Devonian extinction event.

==Gold Mining==

The national park contains many shallow gold diggings, shafts and adits.

The most notable in the Fraser block are those of Italian Gully, originally worked in the 1870&#x27;s and then again in the 1930&#x27;s.



==Flora and Fauna==

The park&#x27;s vegetation is generally dry, open eucalypt forest with areas of riparian forest and montane forest. Main eucalypt species are stringybarks, peppermints, Red Box and Candlebark with areas of Mountain Ash and Blue Gum.

The park&#x27;s known native fauna includes 34 species of mammals, 89 birds, 17 reptiles, 10 amphibians, and three freshwater fish. Threatened fauna recorded in the park include the Brush-tailed Phascogale and Spotted Tree-Frog. Eastern Grey Kangaroos are very common in the park&#x27;s camping places

After being hunted to extinction for their skins, in 1967 25 Koalas were reintroduced to the park from Phillip Island and released in the Devils Cove area.

Sambar Deer are also found throughout the park.

== Cultural Sites ==

There are numerous cultural sites in the National Park, demonstrating the areas past use for grazing and mining.

One of these is Stone&#x27;s Outstation, located on Station Creek near Aird Inlet.

==Location==
Lake Eildon National Park is non-contiguous and consists of five &#x27;blocks&#x27; merged together in June 1997 to create a single national park. They are:

From the former Eildon State Park:
* Enterprise - located in the centre of Lake Eildon itself.
* Jamieson - located on the eastern side of the national park adjacent to the township of Jamieson. 
* Jerusalem - located on the southern of the national park, named for Jerusalem Creek. It contains Jerusalem Creek camping area with pit toilets as well as O’Toole Flat and Taylors Creek which are nominally designated for deer hunters.
From the former Fraser National Park:
* Fraser - located on the western side of the national park, named for the former park. It is the most developed and contains three camping areas; Lakeside, Candlebark and Devil Cove, all of which feature flushing toilets, hot showers, drinking water and gas BBQs.
* Wappan - located on the north west side. It is the least developed with no public vehicle access.

==Visitors==
Most visitors use the park as a base for water-based activities on Lake Eildon, such as power boating and water ski-ing. Deer hunting is permitted in season in some sections of the park.

Mountaineer Inlet Boat Camp has no vehicle access and is for use for boaters and hikers only.

<doc id="102021" wikidata="Q1127201" url="?curid=102021" title="Mitchell River National Park (Victoria)">
<text>The Mitchell River National Park is a national park located in the Gippsland region of Victoria, Australia. The national park is situated approximately east of Melbourne via the Princes Highway, and approximately northwest of Bairnsdale. The northern portion of the park may be accessed via .

==Mitchell River==
The park&#x27;s central feature is the Mitchell River, which is the largest unregulated river in Victoria and provides a unique example of riparian ecology.

According to a Land Conservation Council Rivers &amp; Streams Special Investigation completed in 1990, &quot;It is an important example of the large-scale biological systems that were once widespread in south-eastern Australia.&quot; In 1992 the Mitchell River was listed as a Heritage River.

==The park==
The national park surrounds the spectacular Mitchell River where it has cut its way through rock strata creating high cliffs and several gorges. The park originated as the &quot;Glenaladale National Park&quot; in 1963 following a donation of of land from Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd. An addition of was made in 1986 at which time the name was changed to the Mitchell River National Park. The park was further extended in 2003 by to bring the total area to .

In some of the gorges are found remnants of warm-temperate rainforest, the southernmost occurrence of this type of forest in the world. It can survive here as the steep walls of the gorges protect it from the annual drying summer winds and the bushfires that occasionally rage through the area.

There are recorded sightings of more than 150 bird species and 25 mammal species in the park. Vegetation in the park includes papery-barked kanooka trees, lilly-pillys, muttonwoods, ferns, mosses, vines, and lianas. In the drier areas, typical Australian species such as wattle and eucalypt dominate.

The Mitchell River was an important location to the Gunai/Kurnai nation, especially the Brabuwooloong and the Brayakuloong people of central Gippsland. One of the features of the park is the &quot;Den of Nargun&quot; mentioned in Aboriginal legends.

Gold was discovered in the area in 1857. Alluvial fields along the Mitchell River and its tributaries were worked into the early twentieth century, while there was also some reef mining from the 1860s. Later use by Europeans mainly involved timber and farming.

===Den of Nargun===
According to Gunai tribal legends, the Nargun is a fierce half-human half-stone creature that lived in the den, a cave under a rock overhang behind a small waterfall. The Den of Nargun is found on Woolshed Creek, a small tributary of the Mitchell River, about upstream from where the creek joins the river. In the legend the Nargun would abduct children who visited the rockpool. It was said the Nargun could not be harmed with boomerangs or spears, as they would be reflected back to the thrower.

The Den of Nargun was considered a special place for women of the Gunai tribe, being used for women&#x27;s initiation and learning ceremonies. Thus the stories would have served the purpose of keeping children away from the sacred area, as well as keeping them near the campsite. The den was once rimmed with stalactites, but unfortunately these have been broken off as souvenirs by visitors over the years. A similar, though less well known site, called Deadcock Den is situated on Woolshed Creek downstream from the Den of Nargun, only about from where it joins the Mitchell River. This site was also of great cultural significance to the Gunai people, in particular the women.

<doc id="102022" wikidata="Q1534934" url="?curid=102022" title="Mornington Peninsula National Park">
<text>The Mornington Peninsula National Park is a national park located in the Greater Melbourne region of Victoria, Australia. The national park is situated approximately south of Melbourne on the Mornington Peninsula.

Together with the adjacent Arthurs Seat State Park, the national park was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate, in recognition of their outstanding values and their importance as part
of the protected area&#x27;s heritage.

==Features==
The Coast Walk, a two-day walking track from Cape Schanck to London Bridge takes in almost the entire coastline of the national park. The walk features a network of cliff top tracks with spectacular ocean views and dense coastal vegetation, as well as sections of long beach walks which pass by sculpted sand dunes and tidal rock pools. The Farnsworth Track links Portsea Surf Beach with London Bridge and is in length. The Coppins Track is a return walking track from Sorrento Ocean Beach to Diamond Bay. The Cape Schanck Lighthouse and associated buildings were constructed from 1859 and are excellent example of the architecture of the day.

Situated between Arthurs Seat and Cape Schanck on the Mornington Peninsula, Greens Bush is the largest remnant of bushland on the Peninsula. Surrounded by farmland, the area contains a variety of vegetation communities, making it a wildlife haven and excellent place for nature walking.

Horse riding is a popular activity in parts of the national park, with access from the national park entrance station near Gunnamatta and also near . Dog walking is also permitted in certain parts of beachland within the park, within certain hours; with dogs required to be kept on a leash.

<text>The Morwell National Park is a national park located in the western Gippsland region of Victoria, Australia. The national park is situated approximately east of Melbourne via the Princes Highway and south of Morwell in the Strzelecki Ranges. The park preserves a remnant of previously widespread wet sclerophyll forests and some rainforest remnants restricted to deep creek gullies. 320 plant species have been recorded for this park, including five rare or threatened species and 44 orchid species. 129 native fauna species have been recorded, including 19 mammals, 96 birds, 11 reptiles and three amphibians.

Weeds and pest animals represent a threat to the park, particularly because of its small size.

The park was created by a 1967 Act of Parliament, in response to lobbying from members of the Latrobe Valley Field Naturalists Club. Club members had recognised the ecological significance of the land in the early 1950s after finding butterfly orchid (&quot;Sarcochilus australis),&quot; as well as other notable species of flora and fauna&quot;.&quot;

The national park is protected by the local conservation society, the Friends of Morwell National Park.
