<text>Donald Arthur Mattingly (born April 20, 1961) is an American professional baseball coach, and former first baseman and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). He is the bench coach for the Toronto Blue Jays of MLB. Nicknamed &quot;the Hit Man&quot; and &quot;Donnie Baseball&quot;, he spent his entire 14-year MLB playing career with the New York Yankees and later managed the Los Angeles Dodgers for five years and the Miami Marlins for seven years.

Mattingly graduated from Reitz Memorial High School in Evansville, Indiana, and was selected by the Yankees in the 1979 amateur draft. Debuting with the Yankees in 1982 after four seasons in Minor League Baseball, he emerged as the Yankees&#x27; starting first baseman after a successful rookie season in 1983. Mattingly was named to the American League (AL) All-Star team six times. He won nine Gold Glove Awards (an AL record for a first baseman), three Silver Slugger Awards, the 1984 AL batting title, and was the 1985 AL Most Valuable Player. He served as captain of the Yankees from 1991 through 1995, when he retired as a player. The Yankees later retired Mattingly&#x27;s uniform number (23), making him the only Yankee to have his number retired without having won a World Series with the team.

Returning to the Yankees as a coach in 2004 for manager Joe Torre, he followed Torre to the Dodgers in 2008, and succeeded him as the Dodgers&#x27; manager in 2011. The Dodgers and Mattingly mutually parted ways after the 2015 season, and he became manager of the Miami Marlins in 2016. He remained with the Marlins until after the 2022 season.

==Early life==
Donald Arthur Mattingly was born on April 20, 1961, in Evansville, Indiana. Mattingly is ambidextrous. He pitched in Little League Baseball and was also a first baseman, throwing both right-handed and left-handed, and was a member of the 1973 Great Scot Little League championship team in Evansville, Indiana, under the coaching of Pete Studer and Earl Hobbs. In American Legion baseball for Funkhouser Post #8, Mattingly played at second base, throwing right-handed.

Playing for Reitz Memorial High School&#x27;s baseball team, the Tigers, Mattingly led the school to a state record 59 straight victories through the 1978–79 season, losing to the Logansport Berries. The Tigers won the state championship in 1978 and finished as the runner-up in 1979. Mattingly was the L.V. Phillips Mental Attitude recipient in 1979. He was All-City, All-Southern Indiana Athletic Conference (SIAC), and All-State in 1978 and 1979. During the four years he played in high school, Mattingly batted .463, leading the Tigers to a 94–9–1 win–loss record. He still holds Reitz Memorial records for hits (152), doubles (29), triples (25), runs batted in (RBIs) (140), and runs scored (99). His 25 triples are also an Indiana state record. A multisport athlete (basketball, football and baseball), Mattingly was selected to the SIAC all-conference basketball team in 1978.

Following his high school career, Mattingly accepted a scholarship to play baseball for the Indiana State Sycamores.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor Leagues===

Mattingly lasted in the 1979 Major League Baseball draft until the 19th round, when he was selected by the New York Yankees. His father, Bill, informed Major League Baseball (MLB) teams that his son intended to honor his college commitment and would not sign a professional contract. Don Mattingly was not interested in attending college, so he chose to sign with the Yankees, receiving a $23,000 signing bonus.

Mattingly began his professional career in Minor League Baseball with the Oneonta Yankees of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League in 1979. He hoped to bat .500 for Oneonta and was disappointed with his .349 batting average, which never went lower than .340. He batted a league-leading .358 in 1980 for the Greensboro Hornets of the Class A South Atlantic League in addition to recording a league-best 177 hits. He won the league MVP award and was named to the postseason All-Star team. With the Double-A Nashville Sounds in 1981, he hit .316 and led the Southern League with 35 doubles. He was selected to play in the Southern League All-Star Game and named to its postseason All-Star team.

Despite Mattingly&#x27;s hitting ability, concerns existed about his lack of speed and power. Bob Schaefer, his manager at Greensboro, said that the organization considered moving him to second base, from which he would throw right-handed. Mattingly was batting .325 for the Columbus Clippers of the Triple-A International League when he made it to the majors late in the 1982 season. He was named to the league&#x27;s postseason All-Star team and finished third in the voting for the International League MVP Award.

===New York Yankees (1982–1995)===
Mattingly made his Major League debut on September 8, 1982, as a late-inning defensive replacement against the Baltimore Orioles. He recorded his first at-bat on September 11 against the Milwaukee Brewers, popping out to third base in the seventh inning. His first career major-league hit occurred in the bottom of the 11th inning against the Boston Red Sox on October 1, a single to right field off Steve Crawford. He only had two hits in 12 at-bats that season.

Mattingly spent his rookie season of 1983 as a part-time first baseman and outfielder. He hit .283 in 279 at-bats. He hit his first home run on June 24 against John Tudor of the Red Sox.

Mattingly became the Yankees&#x27; full-time first baseman in 1984. With a batting average of .339, he was selected as a reserve for the 1984 All-Star Game. Heading into the final game of the season, Mattingly and teammate Dave Winfield were competing for the American League batting title, with Mattingly trailing Winfield by .002. On the final day of the season, Mattingly went 4-for-5, while Winfield batted 1-for-4. Mattingly won the batting title with a .343 average, while Winfield finished second with a .340 average. Mattingly also led the league with 207 hits. He hit a league-leading 44 doubles to go with 23 home runs. He was second in the league in slugging percentage (.537) and at-bats per strikeout (18.3), fourth in total bases (324), fifth in RBIs (110), sixth in sacrifice flies (9), and 10th in on-base percentage (.381).
Mattingly followed up his breakout season with a spectacular 1985, winning the MVP award in the American League. He batted .324 (third in the league) with 35 home runs (fourth), 48 doubles (first), and 145 RBIs (first), then the most RBIs in a season by a left-handed major league batter since Ted Williams drove in 159 in 1949. His 21 RBI margin over second place in that category was the largest in the American League since Al Rosen&#x27;s 30 RBIs in 1953. He led the league in sacrifice flies (15), total bases (370), and extra-base hits (86), and was second in the AL in hits (211) and slugging percentage (.567), third in intentional walks (13) and at bats per strikeout (13.9), sixth in runs (107), and ninth in at-bats per home run (18.6). He batted .354 with two out and runners in scoring position.

Mattingly was also recognized in 1985 for his defense, winning his first of nine Gold Glove Awards. He was considered such an asset defensively that Yankees management assigned him to play games at second base and third base early in his career, though he was a left-handed thrower. Mattingly appeared as a left-handed throwing second baseman for one-third of one inning, during the resumption of the George Brett &quot;Pine Tar Incident&quot; game in 1983. He also played three games at third base during a five-game series against the Seattle Mariners in 1986.

Mattingly had a better year in 1986, leading the league with 238 hits and 53 doubles, and breaking the single-season franchise records set by Earle Combs (231 hits) and Lou Gehrig (52 doubles); both records had been set in 1927. He also recorded 388 total bases and a .573 slugging percentage. He batted .352 (second in the league), hit 31 home runs (sixth) and drove in 113 runs (third). He was beaten in the American League MVP voting, though, by pitcher Roger Clemens, who also won the Cy Young Award that year. Mattingly also became the last left-handed player to field a ball at third base during an MLB game.

In 1987, Mattingly tied Dale Long&#x27;s major-league record by hitting home runs in eight consecutive games, from 8–18 July (the All-Star game occurred in the middle of the streak; Mattingly, starting at first base, was 0 for 3). This record was later tied again by Ken Griffey Jr., of Seattle in 1993. Mattingly also set a record by recording an extra-base hit in 10 consecutive games. Mattingly had a record 10 home runs during this streak (Long and Griffey had eight during their streaks). Also that season, Mattingly set a major-league record by hitting six grand slams in a season (two during his July home-run streak), a record matched by Travis Hafner during the 2006 season. Mattingly&#x27;s grand slams in 1987 were also the only grand slams of his career.

In June 1987, Mattingly reportedly injured his back during some clubhouse horseplay with pitcher Bob Shirley, though both denied this. Nevertheless, he finished with a .327 batting average, 30 home runs, and 115 RBIs, his fourth straight year with at least 110 RBIs. Between 1985 and 1987, Mattingly hit 96 home runs with just 114 strikeouts.
Mattingly hit 18 home runs and recorded 88 RBIs in 1988, but still was in the top 10 in the league in batting average at a .311 average. He rebounded in 1989 to 113 RBIs, but his average dipped to .303. Mattingly&#x27;s five runs scored on April 30, 1988, marked the 12th time it has been done by a Yankee.

Mattingly&#x27;s back problems flared up anew in 1990; after struggling with the bat, he had to go on the disabled list in July, only returning late in the season for an ineffective finish. His statistics line—a .256 average, five home runs, and 42 RBIs in almost 400 at-bats—came as a shock. Mattingly underwent extensive therapy in the offseason, but his hitting ability was never quite the same. Though he averaged .290 over his final five seasons, he became more of a slap hitter, hitting just 53 home runs over that time. He did see a brief resurgence in power in 1993, hitting 17 home runs and driving in 86 runs in 134 games, as the Yankees finished second in the division behind Toronto. In the strike-shortened 1994 season, he posted a .304 average, the first time since 1989 that he hit over .300. Mattingly&#x27;s defense remained stellar, but he was not always physically able to play.

Mattingly made his major-league debut in 1982, the year after the Yankees lost the World Series. The team did not reach the postseason in any of Mattingly&#x27;s first 13 years, although they arguably would have made the playoffs in 1994, when the players&#x27; strike ended the season prematurely with the Yankees having the best record in the American League.

In 1995, Mattingly finally reached the playoffs when the Yankees won the AL wild card on the next-to-last day of the season. In the only postseason series of his career, facing the Seattle Mariners, Mattingly batted .417 with six RBIs and a memorable go-ahead home run in game two, his final game at Yankee Stadium. In the final game of the series (and of his career), Mattingly again broke a tie with a two-run double. The New York bullpen faltered and Seattle won in the 11th inning of the decisive game five.

The Yankees acquired Tino Martinez to succeed Mattingly after the 1995 season. Unsigned for the 1996 season, Mattingly decided to sit out for the year, and rebuffed an inquiry by the Baltimore Orioles, which tried to sign him at midseason. Mattingly officially announced his retirement in January 1997.

For his career, Mattingly never appeared in the World Series, and his tenure with the Yankees marks the team&#x27;s largest drought without a World Series appearance. The Yankees made the series in both (the year prior to Mattingly&#x27;s rookie year) and their championship season (the year after his last with the club).

==Coaching career==

===New York Yankees (2004–2007)===
After retiring as a player, Mattingly spent seven seasons as a special instructor during Yankees&#x27; spring training in Tampa, Florida, from 1997 through 2003. Following the 2003 season, the Yankees named Mattingly the hitting coach. He spent three seasons in that role, receiving much praise from the Yankees organization and his players. Under Mattingly, the Yankees set an all-time franchise record with 242 home runs in 2004. After the 2006 season, Mattingly shifted to bench coach, replacing Lee Mazzilli.

After the 2007 season, when Joe Torre declined a one-year contract extension, Mattingly was a finalist for the Yankees&#x27; manager position, along with Joe Girardi and Tony Peña. The Yankees offered the managerial position to Girardi, who accepted.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2008–2010)===
After not being offered the position of manager for the Yankees, Mattingly joined Torre with the Los Angeles Dodgers as the team&#x27;s hitting coach. On January 22, 2008, Mattingly was replaced as hitting coach, citing family reasons, instead serving as major-league special-assignment coach for the Dodgers in 2008. Mattingly succeeded Mike Easler as Dodgers&#x27; hitting coach that July. The Dodgers were the National League runners-up in 2008 and 2009 (losing to the Philadelphia Phillies in both National League championship series), largely behind the bat of midseason acquisition Manny Ramirez.
In the 2009–10 offseason, Mattingly was a finalist for the managerial position with the Cleveland Indians, for which Manny Acta was eventually hired.

===Toronto Blue Jays (2023–present)===
On November 30, 2022, the Toronto Blue Jays announced that Mattingly would join the team as its bench coach. Ahead of the 2024 season, Mattingly was given the additional title of offensive coordinator, overseeing the team&#x27;s hitting coaches and video coordinator. Following the 2024 season, Mattingly&#x27;s role was reverted to that of a traditional bench coach.

==Managerial career==
===Los Angeles Dodgers (2010–2015)===
When Torre decided to retire at the end of the 2010 season, Mattingly was announced as his replacement. To acquire some managerial experience, Mattingly managed the Phoenix Desert Dogs of the Arizona Fall League in 2010.

Mattingly made his managerial debut on March 31, 2011, by defeating in-state rival and defending champion San Francisco Giants 2–1 at Dodger Stadium. Despite the background of a bitter divorce battle between Dodgers&#x27; owner Frank McCourt and his wife that put the fiscal health of the Dodgers into jeopardy, Mattingly managed to take the Dodgers to a winning record that season due to his mentorship of many young players such as MVP candidate Matt Kemp and Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw:

&quot;He&#x27;s so positive&quot;, Kershaw said. &quot;All he asks of us is just go out there and play the way we&#x27;re supposed to. Do things the right way on the field, and he&#x27;s happy with you. When it&#x27;s simple like that, it&#x27;s easy to play for, and it&#x27;s fun to play for.&quot; 

In 2013, Mattingly and the Dodgers got off to a rough start due to various injuries, and were in last place in May, leading to much media speculation that he would soon be fired. Once players got healthy, though, the team went on a tear and managed to win the NL West and beat the Atlanta Braves in the 2013 National League Division Series (NLDS) in four games. They then lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS in six games. After the season, Mattingly called out Dodger management for its perceived lack of support of him during the season and said that he wanted a multiyear contract in place to return in 2014. Mattingly finished second in the voting for National League Manager of the Year.

Mattingly stated that one of his managerial idols was Tony La Russa. Mattingly admired La Russa from his playing days with the Yankees in the late 1980s. LaRussa had managed the dominant Oakland Athletics teams of the era. Mattingly recalled that despite the A&#x27;s superiority to the Yankees, they still played intensely.

On January 7, 2014, Mattingly and the Dodgers agreed on a three-year contract extension for him to remain as manager of the Dodgers.The Dodgers lost in five games to the New York Mets in the NLDS.

On October 22, 2015, the Dodgers and Mattingly mutually agreed to part ways, and he stepped down from his position with one year left on his contract. He had a 446–363 record with the Dodgers, with a winning percentage of .551, which was second-best in Los Angeles Dodgers history. He finished with a postseason record of eight wins and 11 losses and was the first manager in franchise history to guide the team to three straight postseason appearances.

===Miami Marlins (2016–2022)===

In fall of 2015, Mattingly signed a four-year contract to manage the Miami Marlins. Mattingly led the Marlins to win 79 games in his first year (the most wins for the team since winning 80 in 2010), which had him place fifth in the final voting for NL Manager of the Year. In 2020, Mattingly led the Marlins to the NL Wild Card, leading them to the playoffs for the first time since 2003. He also won the NL Manager of the Year award. On July 8, 2021, Mattingly&#x27;s mutual option for the 2022 season was picked up by both the Marlins and him. On September 25, 2022, Mattingly stated that the Marlins and he mutually agreed that he would finish the season as manager, and not return to the role in 2023.

==International career==
Mattingly managed the MLB All-Star Team at the 2018 MLB Japan All-Star Series.

==Managerial record==


==Legacy==
Mattingly finished his career with 2,153 hits, 222 home runs, 1,007 runs scored, 1,099 RBIs, and a .307 lifetime batting average. He is commonly cited as the best Yankee player to have never played in a World Series. His career had bad timing, as the Yankees lost the World Series the year before he broke into the big leagues and they ended up winning the World Series in the first year of Mattingly&#x27;s retirement, not to mention the Yankees had the best record in the American League in 1994 before the strike. This World Series drought (1982–1995) was the longest in Yankees history since the start of the Babe Ruth era, and it was worsened by the strike, which ended a promising chance for a World Series title.

Buck Showalter, Mattingly&#x27;s last manager during his playing days and a former teammate in the minor leagues, attributed Mattingly&#x27;s calmness to the controversies he was subjected to as manager of the Dodgers to Mattingly&#x27;s regularly having to deal with even more craziness during his time with the Yankees.

The Yankees retired Mattingly&#x27;s number 23 and dedicated his plaque for Monument Park at Yankee Stadium on August 31, 1997. The plaque calls him, &quot;A humble man of grace and dignity, a captain who led by example, proud of the pinstripe tradition and dedicated to the pursuit of excellence, a Yankee forever.&quot; Additionally, his uniform number with the Double-A Nashville Sounds (18) was retired by the team in a ceremony at Herschel Greer Stadium attended by Mattingly on August 12, 1999.

===National Hall of Fame consideration===
Mattingly was on the Hall of Fame ballot from 2001 to 2015, never getting enough votes for induction. In his first year, he received 145 votes (28.2%), but this steadily declined; by 2009, only 12% of voters still put him on their ballots. In 2015, Mattingly&#x27;s eligibility expired after fifteen attempts. He had been grandfathered onto the ballot after the committee restricted eligibility to ten years. Mattingly is now eligible to be inducted into the Hall of Fame via the Contemporary Baseball Era Players Committee. He was shortlisted for the 2018, 2020, and 2022 ballots, but did not receive enough votes for induction.

Mattingly has been honored by two minor-league halls of fame. He was inducted in the South Atlantic League Hall of Fame in 1994 and the New York–Penn League Hall of Fame in 2015.

In 2001, Mattingly was inducted into the Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame; his plaque displays his phenomenal high school and professional careers. In 1987, he was named the American Legion Graduate of the Year, for his success in the major leagues following his American Legion baseball career.

==Personal life==

Mattingly married Kim Sexton on September 8, 1979; they divorced after his playing career ended, amid reports of Kim&#x27;s issues with alcoholism. Mattingly and Kim share three sons: Taylor, Preston, and Jordon. Taylor was drafted in the 42nd round (1,262nd overall) of the 2003 Major League Baseball draft by the New York Yankees, and played in 24 games for the Gulf Coast Yankees in the rookie league before an injury cut short his season. After sitting out all of 2004 and 2005, Taylor retired from baseball in 2005 after only 58 professional at-bats. Preston is the general manager for the Philadelphia Phillies.

Mattingly remarried on December 10, 2010, in his hometown of Evansville, Indiana. The wedding, and his managing the Phoenix Desert Dogs of the Arizona Fall League, prevented him from attending the 2010 winter meetings. In 2014, he had another son, Louis.

Mattingly&#x27;s older brother, Randy Mattingly, played quarterback at the University of Evansville and was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the fourth round of the 1973 NFL draft before playing in the Canadian Football League.

==Business ventures==
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Don Mattingly was the owner of a restaurant in Evansville, Indiana, called &quot;Mattingly&#x27;s 23&quot;, after the uniform number he wore for most of his career.

In 2005, Mattingly launched Mattingly Sports, a baseball and softball equipment company, based primarily around the patented V-Grip baseball and softball bats.

Mattingly is the founder of Mattingly Charities, a nonprofit organization that serves underprivileged youth by supporting programs that promote baseball and softball participation in conjunction with other developmentally related activities.

==In popular culture==
Mattingly appeared in a baseball-themed episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot;, which originally aired on February 20, 1992. In the episode, team manager Mr. Burns repeatedly demands that Mattingly trim his sideburns, leading Mattingly to protest that he had no sideburns, and to eventually shave much of his head. Burns, irate, cuts him from the team for defying his orders. As he departs, the exasperated Mattingly says to himself, &quot;I still like him better than Steinbrenner.&quot; In 1991, before the episode aired, but after it was produced, then-Yankees manager Stump Merrill told him that until he cut his hair, he would not play. This was in accord with Yankee owner George Steinbrenner&#x27;s appearance policy requiring his players to maintain well-kept head and facial hair. Mattingly was sporting a longish or mullet-like hair style, and when he refused to cut it, he was benched.

Mattingly has also appeared in public-service announcements airing on the Spike TV network advocating fathers spending time with their children as part of the &quot;True Dads&quot; campaign to encourage men to take an active role in their children&#x27;s lives.

Mattingly is referred to by name in several episodes of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. In one episode, his uniform pants split because they were made of 100% cotton at the behest of George Costanza.

Mattingly appeared as a guest artist on Christian recording artist Matt Felts&#x27; album, &quot;Based on a True Story&quot;. Mattingly lends his voice on a song entitled &quot;The First Baseball Game&quot;.

<doc id="102830" wikidata="Q361366" url="?curid=102830" title="Robert Lansing">
<text>Robert Lansing (; October 17, 1864 – October 30, 1928) was an American lawyer and diplomat who served as the 42nd United States Secretary of State under President Woodrow Wilson from 1915 to 1920. As Counselor to the State Department and then as Secretary of State, he was a leading advocate for American involvement in World War I.

Lansing was born and raised in Watertown, New York, where he joined his father&#x27;s law firm after graduating from Amherst College. After developing expertise in international law and marrying the daughter of Secretary of State John W. Foster, he served as associate counsel to the United States delegations to the Bering Sea Arbitration and Bering Sea Claims, before arguing the United States case before the Alaska Boundary Tribunal in 1903.

As a conservative, pro-business voice in the Democratic Party, Lansing was appointed by Woodrow Wilson as Counselor to the State Department under Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan. When Bryan resigned on June 8, 1915 over Wilson&#x27;s policy toward Germany, Lansing was elevated to succeed him.

As Secretary of State, Lansing was a strong advocate for the United States&#x27; role in establishing international law and an avowed critic of German autocracy and Russian Bolshevism. Before U.S. involvement in the war, Lansing vigorously advocated freedom of the seas and the rights of neutral nations. He later advocated U.S. participation in World War I, negotiated the Lansing–Ishii Agreement with Japan in 1917 and was a member of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace at Paris in 1919. However, Wilson made Colonel House his chief foreign policy advisor because Lansing privately opposed much of the Treaty of Versailles and was skeptical of the Wilsonian principle of self-determination.

==Career==
Robert Lansing was born in Watertown, New York, the son of John Lansing (1832–1907) and Maria Lay (Dodge) Lansing. He graduated from Amherst College in 1886, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1889.

From then to 1907, he was a member of the law firm of Lansing &amp; Lansing at Watertown. An authority on international law, he served as associate counsel for the United States, during the Bering Sea Arbitration from 1892–1893, as counsel for the United States Bering Sea Claims Commission in 1896–1897, as the government&#x27;s lawyer before the Alaskan Boundary Tribunal in 1903, as counsel for the North Atlantic Fisheries in the Arbitration at The Hague in 1909–1910, and as agent of the United States in the American and British Arbitration in 1912–1914. In 1914 Lansing was appointed counselor to the State Department by President Woodrow Wilson. Lansing, who had argued cases before Judge Nicholas D. Yost in Watertown, was responsible for encouraging the judge&#x27;s son, future Ambassador Charles W. Yost, to join the Foreign Service. He was a founding member of the American Society of International Law and helped establish the American Journal of International Law.

===World War I===
Lansing initially advocated for the United States to adopt a position of &quot;benevolent neutrality&quot; after the outbreak of World War I and opposed the blockade of Germany by the Allied powers.

Following the sinking of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; on 7 May 1915 by the German submarine , Lansing backed Woodrow Wilson in issuing three notes of protest to the German government. William Jennings Bryan resigned as Secretary of State following Wilson&#x27;s second note, which Bryan considered too belligerent. Consulting Colonel House, Wilson was advised to select Lansing as replacement secretary because he did not have &quot;too many ideas of his own&quot;. Unlike Bryan he lacked a political base, though he had technical knowledge of international law and diplomatic procedure. Wilson told Colonel House that as president he would practically be his own Secretary of State, and &quot;Lansing would not be troublesome by uprooting or injecting his own views.&quot;

According to John Milton Cooper, appointing Lansing and then &quot;treating him like a clerk&quot; would be one of Wilson&#x27;s worst mistakes as president. While Wilson set foreign policy directions almost entirely on his own, Lansing resented this treatment, and attempted to undermine the president in various ways. As Lansing said in his memoirs, following the &quot;Lusitania&quot; tragedy he had the &quot;conviction that we would ultimately become the ally of Britain&quot;. According to Lester H. Woolsey, Lansing expressed his views by manipulating the work of the State Department to minimize conflict with Britain and maximize public awareness of Germany&#x27;s faults. 

Woolsey states:Although the President cherished the hope that the United States would not be drawn into the war, and while this was the belief of many officials, Mr. Lansing early in July, 1915, came to the conclusion that the German ambition for world domination was the real menace of the war, particularly to democratic institutions. In order to block this German ambition, he believed that the progress of the war would eventually disclose to the American people the purposes of the German Government; that German activities in the United States and in Latin America should be carefully investigated and frustrated; that the American republics to the south should be weaned from the German influences; that friendly relations with Mexico should be maintained even to the extent of recognizing the Carranza faction; that the Danish West Indies should be acquired in order to remove the possibility of Germany&#x27;s obtaining a foothold in the Caribbean by conquest of Denmark or otherwise; that the United States should enter the war if it should appear that Germany would become the victor; and that American public opinion must be awakened in preparation for this contingency. This outline of Mr. Lansing&#x27;s views explains why the Lusitania dispute was not brought to the point of a break. It also explains why, though Americans were incensed at the British interference with commerce, the controversy was kept within the arena of debate.

German historian Gerhard Ritter wrote of Lansing in this period: &quot;Lansing had the coolest head among all of Wilson&#x27;s advisers. His power politics were least inhibited by moral considerations and pacifist impulses.&quot;

In 1916, Lansing hired a handful of men who became the State Department&#x27;s first special agents in the new Bureau of Secret Intelligence. The agents were initially used to observe the activities of the Central Powers in America and later to watch over interned German diplomats. The small group of agents hired by Lansing would eventually become the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS).

===Later life===
In 1919, Lansing became the nominal head of the US Commission to the Paris Peace Conference. Because he did not regard the League of Nations as essential to the peace treaty, Lansing began to fall out of favor with Wilson, who considered participation in the League of Nations to be a primary goal. During Wilson&#x27;s stroke and illness, Lansing called the cabinet together for consultations on several occasions. In addition, he was the first cabinet member to suggest for Vice President Thomas R. Marshall to assume the powers of the presidency. Displeased by Lansing&#x27;s independence, Edith Wilson requested Lansing&#x27;s resignation. Lansing stepped down from his post on February 12, 1920.

After leaving office, Lansing resumed practicing law. He died in New York City on October 30, 1928 at the age of 64, and was buried at Brookside Cemetery in Watertown, New York.

==Personal life and family==

Through his father Lansing was descended from Thomas Dudley, John Allin, Samuel Appleton and Thomas Mayhew. Through his mother he was descended from Miles Morgan, John Mason, Roger Williams, Anne Hutchinson and John Cutt. In 1890, Lansing married Eleanor Foster, the daughter of Secretary of State John W. Foster. Eleanor&#x27;s older sister Edith was the mother of John Foster Dulles, who also became Secretary of State, Allen Welsh Dulles who served as Director of Central Intelligence, and Eleanor Lansing Dulles, an economist and high level policy analyst and advisor for the State Department.

New York State Senator Robert Lansing (1799–1878) was his grandfather; Chancellor John Lansing Jr. and State Treasurer Abraham G. Lansing were his great-granduncles.

==Authorship==
Lansing was associate editor of the &quot;American Journal of International Law&quot;, and with Gary M. Jones was the author of &quot;Government: Its Origin, Growth, and Form in the United States&quot; (1902). He also wrote: &quot;The Big Four and Others at the Peace Conference&quot;, Boston (1921) and &quot;The Peace Negotiations: A Personal Narrative&quot;, Boston/New York (1921).

Lansing kept a voluminous archive of US government communications during WWI, which are a key resource on US thinking and decision making in this period. 


==Legacy and honors==
During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, and named in his honor.

<doc id="102836" wikidata="Q5027702" url="?curid=102836" title="Camp X-Ray">
<text>Camp X-Ray was a temporary detention facility at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp of Joint Task Force 160 on board the United States Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.
The first twenty detainees arrived at Guantanamo on 11 January 2002.
It was named &quot;Camp X-Ray&quot; because various temporary camps used to house Cuban and Haitian migrants in the 80s and 90s on board the station were named using NATO phonetic alphabet. The legal status of detainees at the camp, as well as government processes for trying their cases, has been a significant source of controversy; several landmark cases have been determined by the United States Supreme Court.

As of 29 April 2002, Camp X-Ray was closed and all prisoners were transferred to Camp Delta.

==Background==

Camp X-Ray was originally built during Operation Sea Signal to house &quot;excludables&quot; in the mid-1990s when Fidel Castro allowed any Cuban wishing to do so, to cross through the Cuban-operated minefields and enter the base. Excludables were held in Camp X-ray near Post 37 before being sent back to Cuba. Excludables included troublemakers from the regular camps, where the United States was processing Cuban Asylum Seekers (CAS) for emigration to the United States. The US government was at the time allowed access to Cuban records to process these people. Over 100,000 CAS were processed in the mid-1990s and allowed to enter the United States.During the War on terror, beginning in the fall of 2001 after the 9/11 attacks, the US reestablished the camp for housing captured combatants. To get the camp up and operational Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133 sent a detachment that had been working at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. The supervision and care of these detainees at Camp X-Ray was handled by Joint Task Force 160 (JTF-160), while interrogations were conducted by Joint Task Force 170 (JTF-170). JTF-160 was under the command of Marine Brigadier General Michael R. Lehnert until March 2002, when he was replaced by Brigadier General Rick Baccus. Since Camp X-Ray&#x27;s closure and the subsequent opening of Camp Delta, JTF-160 and 170 have been combined into Joint Task Force Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO).

In accordance with U.S. military and Geneva Convention doctrine on prisoner treatment, soldiers guarding the detainees were housed in tents with living conditions &quot;not markedly different&quot; from that of the prisoners while the permanent facilities at Camp Delta were under construction. This camp was one of several locations managed by the United States where prisoners had suffered torture by US soldiers and agents in relation to interrogation.

Dick Cheney, as the then Vice President in 2002, said:

Prisoners could be detained until the end of the natural conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan.

==Forensic examination==

According to Carol Rosenberg, writing for the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, Camp X-Ray was visited by a court-ordered forensic FBI team in November 2009. The team spent a week photographing the camp and searching for evidence of abuse of prisoners.

==Brandon Neely==
Camp X-Ray guard Brandon Neely later admitted throwing prisoners to the ground. In 2009, he tracked two inmates down and apologized for his treatment of them, saying that he still felt guilty. Neely also became involved with the organization Iraq Veterans Against the War.

<doc id="102847" wikidata="Q715396" url="?curid=102847" title="Solid-state physics">
<text>Solid-state physics is the study of rigid matter, or solids, through methods such as solid-state chemistry, quantum mechanics, crystallography, electromagnetism, and metallurgy. It is the largest branch of condensed matter physics. Solid-state physics studies how the large-scale properties of solid materials result from their atomic-scale properties. Thus, solid-state physics forms a theoretical basis of materials science. Along with solid-state chemistry, it also has direct applications in the technology of transistors and semiconductors.

==Background==
Solid materials are formed from densely packed atoms, which interact intensely. These interactions produce the mechanical (e.g. hardness and elasticity), thermal, electrical, magnetic and optical properties of solids. Depending on the material involved and the conditions in which it was formed, the atoms may be arranged in a regular, geometric pattern (crystalline solids, which include metals and ordinary water ice) or irregularly (an amorphous solid such as common window glass).

The bulk of solid-state physics, as a general theory, is focused on crystals. Primarily, this is because the periodicity of atoms in a crystal — its defining characteristic — facilitates mathematical modeling. Likewise, crystalline materials often have electrical, magnetic, optical, or mechanical properties that can be exploited for engineering purposes.

The forces between the atoms in a crystal can take a variety of forms. For example, in a crystal of sodium chloride (common salt), the crystal is made up of ionic sodium and chlorine, and held together with ionic bonds. In others, the atoms share electrons and form covalent bonds. In metals, electrons are shared amongst the whole crystal in metallic bonding. Finally, the noble gases do not undergo any of these types of bonding. In solid form, the noble gases are held together with van der Waals forces resulting from the polarisation of the electronic charge cloud on each atom. The differences between the types of solid result from the differences between their bonding.

==History==

The physical properties of solids have been common subjects of scientific inquiry for centuries, but a separate field going by the name of solid-state physics did not emerge until the 1940s, in particular with the establishment of the Division of Solid State Physics (DSSP) within the American Physical Society. The DSSP catered to industrial physicists, and solid-state physics became associated with the technological applications made possible by research on solids. By the early 1960s, the DSSP was the largest division of the American Physical Society.

Large communities of solid state physicists also emerged in Europe after World War II, in particular in England, Germany, and the Soviet Union. In the United States and Europe, solid state became a prominent field through its investigations into semiconductors, superconductivity, nuclear magnetic resonance, and diverse other phenomena. During the early Cold War, research in solid state physics was often not restricted to solids, which led some physicists in the 1970s and 1980s to found the field of condensed matter physics, which organized around common techniques used to investigate solids, liquids, plasmas, and other complex matter. Today, solid-state physics is broadly considered to be the subfield of condensed matter physics, often referred to as hard condensed matter, that focuses on the properties of solids with regular crystal lattices.

==Crystal structure and properties==

Many properties of materials are affected by their crystal structure. This structure can be investigated using a range of crystallographic techniques, including X-ray crystallography, neutron diffraction and electron diffraction.

The sizes of the individual crystals in a crystalline solid material vary depending on the material involved and the conditions when it was formed. Most crystalline materials encountered in everyday life are polycrystalline, with the individual crystals being microscopic in scale, but macroscopic single crystals can be produced either naturally (e.g. diamonds) or artificially.

Real crystals feature defects or irregularities in the ideal arrangements, and it is these defects that critically determine many of the electrical and mechanical properties of real materials.

==Electronic properties==
Properties of materials such as electrical conduction and heat capacity are investigated by solid state physics. An early model of electrical conduction was the Drude model, which applied kinetic theory to the electrons in a solid. By assuming that the material contains immobile positive ions and an &quot;electron gas&quot; of classical, non-interacting electrons, the Drude model was able to explain electrical and thermal conductivity and the Hall effect in metals, although it greatly overestimated the electronic heat capacity.

Arnold Sommerfeld combined the classical Drude model with quantum mechanics in the free electron model (or Drude-Sommerfeld model). Here, the electrons are modelled as a Fermi gas, a gas of particles which obey the quantum mechanical Fermi–Dirac statistics. The free electron model gave improved predictions for the heat capacity of metals, however, it was unable to explain the existence of insulators.

The nearly free electron model is a modification of the free electron model which includes a weak periodic perturbation meant to model the interaction between the conduction electrons and the ions in a crystalline solid. By introducing the idea of electronic bands, the theory explains the existence of conductors, semiconductors and insulators.

The nearly free electron model rewrites the Schrödinger equation for the case of a periodic potential. The solutions in this case are known as Bloch states. Since Bloch&#x27;s theorem applies only to periodic potentials, and since unceasing random movements of atoms in a crystal disrupt periodicity, this use of Bloch&#x27;s theorem is only an approximation, but it has proven to be a tremendously valuable approximation, without which most solid-state physics analysis would be intractable. Deviations from periodicity are treated by quantum mechanical perturbation theory.

<text>The White Ship (; Medieval Latin: &quot;Candida navis&quot;) was a vessel transporting many nobles, including the heir to the English throne, that sank in the English Channel near the Normandy coast off Barfleur during a trip from France to England on 25 November 1120. Only one of approximately 300 people aboard, a butcher from Rouen, survived.

Those who drowned included William Adelin, the only legitimate son and heir of Henry I of England; his half-siblings Matilda FitzRoy and Richard of Lincoln; Richard d&#x27;Avranches, Earl of Chester; and Geoffrey Ridel. With William Adelin&#x27;s death, the king had no obvious successor, and his own death 15 years later set off a succession crisis and a period of civil war in England known as the Anarchy (1135–1153).

== Shipwreck ==

The &quot;White Ship&quot; was a newly refitted vessel captained by Thomas FitzStephen (&quot;Thomas filz Estienne&quot;), whose father Stephen FitzAirard (&quot;Estienne filz Airard&quot;) had been captain of the ship &quot;Mora&quot; for William the Conqueror during the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Thomas offered his ship to Henry I of England to return to England from Barfleur in Normandy. Henry had already made other arrangements, but allowed many in his retinue to take the &quot;White Ship&quot;, including his heir, William Adelin, his illegitimate children Richard of Lincoln and Matilda FitzRoy, Countess of Perche, and many other nobles. 

According to chronicler Orderic Vitalis, the crew asked William Adelin for wine and he supplied it to them in great abundance. By the time the ship was ready to leave there were about 300 people on board, although some, including the future king Stephen of Blois, had disembarked due to the excessive drinking before the ship sailed.

The ship&#x27;s captain, Thomas FitzStephen, was ordered by the revellers to overtake the king&#x27;s ship, which had already sailed. The &quot;White Ship&quot; was fast, of the best construction and had recently been fitted with new materials, which made the captain and crew confident they could reach England first. However, when it set forth in the dark, its port side struck the submerged Quilleboeuf Rock, and the ship quickly capsized. 

William Adelin got into a small boat and could have escaped but turned back to try to rescue his half-sister, Matilda, when he heard her cries for help. His boat was swamped by others trying to save themselves, and William drowned along with them. According to Orderic Vitalis, Berold (Beroldus or Berout), a butcher from Rouen, became the sole survivor of the shipwreck by clinging to the rock. The chronicler further wrote that when Thomas FitzStephen came to the surface after the sinking and learned that William Adelin had not survived, he let himself drown rather than face the king.

One legend holds that the ship was doomed because priests were not allowed to board it and bless it with holy water in the customary manner. For a complete list of those who did or did not travel on the &quot;White Ship&quot;, see Victims of the &quot;White Ship&quot; disaster.

==Repercussions==
A direct result of William Adelin&#x27;s death was the period known as the Anarchy. The &quot;White Ship&quot; disaster had left Henry I with only one legitimate child, a second daughter named Matilda. Although Henry I had forced his barons to swear an oath to support Matilda as his heir on several occasions, a woman had never ruled in England in her own right. Matilda was also unpopular because she was married to Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou, a traditional enemy of England&#x27;s Norman nobles. Upon Henry&#x27;s death in 1135, the English barons were reluctant to accept Matilda as queen regnant.

One of Henry I&#x27;s male relatives, Stephen of Blois, the king&#x27;s nephew by his sister Adela, usurped Matilda as well as his older brothers William and Theobald to become king. Stephen had allegedly planned to travel on the &quot;White Ship&quot; but had disembarked just before it sailed; Orderic Vitalis attributes this to a sudden bout of diarrhoea. 

After Henry I&#x27;s death, Matilda and her husband Geoffrey of Anjou, the founder of the Plantagenet dynasty, launched a long war against Stephen and his allies for control of the English throne. The Anarchy lasted from 1138 to 1153 with devastating effect, especially in southern England.

Contemporary historian William of Malmesbury wrote: 
==Historical fiction==
* Reference to the sinking of the &quot;White Ship&quot; is made in Ken Follett&#x27;s novel &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot; (1989) and its later game adaptation. The ship&#x27;s sinking sets the stage for the entire background of the story, which is based on the subsequent civil war between Matilda (referred to as Maud in the novel) and Stephen. In Follett&#x27;s novel, it is implied that the ship may have been sabotaged; this implication is seen in the TV adaptation – even going so far as to show William Adelin assassinated while on a lifeboat – and the video game adaptation.
* Ellen Jones, &quot;The Fatal Crown&quot; (1991)
* Sharon Kay Penman describes the sinking in detail in her historical novel &quot;When Christ and His Saints Slept&quot; (1994).
* The sinking of the &quot;White Ship&quot; is briefly referenced in Glenn Cooper&#x27;s novel &quot;The Tenth Chamber&quot; (2010).
* The &quot;White Ship&quot; sets the stage for the 2009 novel &quot;&quot; (The Brothers of Job) by the German author Rebecca Gablé, which details the rise of Henry II of England, son of Empress Matilda.
* The long conflict between Stephen and Matilda is important in the &quot;Brother Cadfael&quot; series. This 20-book set of mysteries, by Ellis Peters, has a 12th-century Benedictine monk as its protagonist. Depending on the book, the conflict is either very important or serves as a backdrop to the plots. The sinking directly affects the outcome of the short story &quot;A Light on the Road to Woodstock&quot;.

<text>Lindsey Davis (born 1949) is an English historical novelist, best known as the author of the Falco series of historical crime stories set in ancient Rome and its empire. She is a recipient of the Cartier Diamond Dagger award.

==Life and career==
Davis was born in Birmingham and after taking a degree in English literature at Oxford University (Lady Margaret Hall), she became a civil servant for 13 years. When a romantic novel she had written was runner up for the 1985 &quot;Georgette Heyer Historical Novel Prize&quot;, she decided to become a writer, at first writing romantic serials for the UK women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Woman&#x27;s Realm&quot;. One of these, &quot;The Bride from Bithynia&quot;, was published in her 2023 collection &quot;Voices of Rome&quot;. 

Her dedication of the book &quot;Rebels and Traitors&quot; (2009) reads: &quot;For Richard / dearest and closest of friends / your favourite book / in memory&quot;, and the author&#x27;s website relates: &quot;I am still getting used to life without my dear Richard. For those of you who haven&#x27;t seen this before, he died in October [2008].&quot; The author says in her publisher&#x27;s newsletter: &quot;The greatest recommendation I can give is that Richard, its first reader, thought it wonderful. He devoured chunks, demanding ‘Bring more story!’ even when he was in hospital. One of the last things I was ever able to tell him was that &quot;Rebels and Traitors&quot; was to be published by Random House, so I would be working with dear friends for his favourite book.&quot;

Davis suffered from the eye condition keratoconus from childhood, and in adulthood had a corneal transplant, about which she has said: &quot;A stranger&#x27;s generosity freed me from years of pain and anxiety&quot; and urges her readers to carry a donor card.

==Writing==
Davis&#x27;s interest in history and archaeology led to her writing a historical novel about Vespasian and his lover Antonia Caenis (&quot;The Course of Honour&quot;), for which she could not find a publisher. She tried again, and her first novel featuring the Roman &quot;detective&quot;, Marcus Didius Falco, &quot;The Silver Pigs&quot; (1989), set in the same time period, was the start of her runaway success as a writer of historical whodunnits. A further 19 Falco novels have followed, as well as &quot;The Course of Honour&quot;, which was published in 1997. She published &quot;&quot; in June 2010.

&quot;Rebels and Traitors&quot;, set in the period of the English Civil War, was published in September 2009.

&quot;Master and God&quot;, published in March 2012, is set in ancient Rome and concerns the emperor Domitian.

In 2012, Davis and her publishers, Hodder &amp; Stoughton in the UK and St. Martin&#x27;s Press in the US, announced that she was writing a new series of books centred on Flavia Albia, Falco&#x27;s British-born adopted daughter and &quot;an established female investigator&quot;. The first title, &quot;The Ides of April&quot; was published on 11 April 2013 in the UK, and its sequel, &quot;Enemies at Home&quot;, was published in 2014, followed by annual additions. In an interview in 2019 Davis discussed her plan to write an Albia novel set on each of the seven hills of Rome, starting with the Aventine Hill in the book &quot;The Ides of April&quot; and culminating with the Capitoline Hill in the book &quot;A Capitol Death&quot;. By 2022 she had published three more Albia books, set in particular locations just outside the wall of Rome. After two further books in and around Rome, her 13th Flavia Alba book will be set near Pompeii, ten years after the eruption of Vesuvius.

Davis has won many literary awards, including, in 2011, the Cartier Diamond Dagger of the Crime Writers&#x27; Association given to authors who have made an outstanding lifetime contribution to the genre. She was honorary president of the Classical Association from 1997 to 1998, and is a life member of the Council of the Society of Authors.

<doc id="102853" wikidata="Q3273537" url="?curid=102853" title="Pazyryk burials">
<text>The Pazyryk burials are a number of Scythian (Saka) Iron Age tombs found in the Pazyryk Valley and the Ukok plateau in the Altai Mountains, Siberia, south of the modern city of Novosibirsk, Russia; the site is close to the borders with China, Kazakhstan and Mongolia.

Numerous comparable burials have been found in neighbouring western Mongolia.

The tombs are Scythian-type kurgans, barrow-like tomb mounds containing wooden chambers covered over by large cairns of boulders and stones, dated to the 4th–3rd centuries BCE. The spectacular burials at Pazyryk are responsible for the introduction of the term &quot;kurgan&quot;, a Russian word, into general usage to describe these tombs. The region of the Pazyryk kurgans is considered the type site of the wider Pazyryk culture. The site is included in the Golden Mountains of Altai UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The bearers of the Pazyryk culture were horse-riding pastoral nomads of the steppe, and some may have accumulated great wealth through horse trading with merchants in Persia, India and China. This wealth is evident in the wide array of finds from the Pazyryk tombs, which include many rare examples of organic objects such as felt hangings, Chinese silk, the earliest known pile carpet, horses decked out in elaborate trappings, and wooden furniture and other household goods. These finds were preserved when water seeped into the tombs in antiquity and froze, encasing the burial goods in ice, which remained frozen in the permafrost until the time of their excavation.

Because of a freak climatic freeze, some of the Altai-Sayan burials, notably those of the 5th century BCE at Pazyryk and neighbouring sites, such as Katanda, Shibe, and Tuekta, were isolated from external climatic variations by a protective layer of ice that conserved the organic substances buried in them.
Certain geometric designs and sun symbols, such as the circle and rosette, recur at Pazyryk but are completely outnumbered by animal motifs. Such specifically Scythian features as zoomorphic junctures, i.e. the addition of a part of one animal to the body of another, are rarer in the Altaic region than in southern Russia. The stag and its relatives, however, figure as prominently in Altai-Sayan as in Scythian art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Central-Asian-arts/Visual-arts&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;At Pazyryk too are found bearded mascarons (masks) of well-defined Greco-Roman origin, which were doubtless inspired by the Hellenistic kingdoms of the Cimmerian Bosporus.&quot;

==Pazyryk culture==

Rudenko initially assigned the neutral label Pazyryk culture for these nomads and dated them to the 5th century BCE; the dating has been revised for barrows 1-5 at Pazyryk, which are now considered to date to the 4th–3rd centuries BCE. The Pazyryk culture has since been connected to the Scythians whose similar tombs have been found across the steppes. The Siberian animal style tattooing is characteristic of the Scythians. The artifacts show that these ancient Altai nomads had cultural and trading links to Central Asia, China and the Near East. There is evidence that Pazyryk trade routes were vast and connected with large areas of Asia including India, perhaps Pazyryk merchants largely trading in high quality horses.

== Discoveries ==

The first tomb at Pazyryk, barrow 1, was excavated by the archaeologist M. P. Griaznov in 1929; barrows 2–5 were excavated by Sergei Ivanovich Rudenko in 1947–1949. While many of the tombs had already been looted in earlier times, the excavators unearthed buried horses, and with them immaculately preserved cloth saddles, felt and woven rugs including the world&#x27;s oldest pile carpet, a 3-metre-high four-wheel funeral chariot from the 5th century BCE and other splendid objects that had escaped the ravages of time. These finds are now exhibited at the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.

Cranial measurements from the Pazyryk burials performed in the 1960s suggested that the interred were largely of European ancestry with some admixture of Northeast Asian ancestry. But genetically, the Pazyryk population was actually fairly balanced between western and eastern Eurasian ancestry: it was modeled to derive between c. 50% from the Khövsgöl_LBA source, c. 36% from Western Steppe Herders (Steppe_MLBA), and c. 14% from a BMAC-like source. One outlier specimen (Pazyryk_Berel_50BCE) could be modeled as c. 18% Pazyryk_IA and c. 82% additional Northeast Asian admixture, suggesting that this individual represents a migrant who arrived from further East.

===Pazyryk-1===
Tomb number 1 at Pazyryk has numerous artifacts, including horses wearing deer antlers masks, or harnesses with human figures. The tomb is dated to the 4th century BCE. Its main content was looted, but the area with horse sacrifices remained intact. It was excavated by Griaznov in the 1930s.
===Pazyryk-2 chief===

Rudenko&#x27;s most striking discovery in 1947 was the body of a tattooed Pazyryk chief in burial mound 2: a thick-set, powerfully built man, 176cm tall, who had died when he was between 55 and 60. His tomb was monumental and lavishly equipped. He died violently, and was killed with a Scythian-type battle axe, and scalped. He was carefully embalmed, and his body was covered in animal style tattoos, but not his face. Parts of the body had deteriorated, but much of the tattooing was still clearly visible (see image). Subsequent investigation using reflected infrared photography revealed that all five bodies discovered in the Pazyryk kurgans were tattooed. No instruments specifically designed for tattooing were found, but the Pazyryks had extremely fine needles with which they did miniature embroidery, and these were probably used for tattooing.

The chief was elaborately decorated with an interlocking series of striking designs representing a variety of fantastic beasts. The best preserved tattoos were images of a donkey, a mountain ram, two highly stylized deer with long antlers and an imaginary carnivore on the right arm. Two monsters resembling griffins decorate the chest, and on the left arm are three partially obliterated images which seem to represent two deer and a mountain goat. On the front of the right leg a fish extends from the foot to the knee. A monster crawls over the right foot, and on the inside of the shin is a series of four running rams which touch each other to form a single design. The left leg also bears tattoos, but these designs could not be clearly distinguished. In addition, the chief&#x27;s back is tattooed with a series of small circles in line with the vertebral column. 

His embalmed head, now in the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, suggests a rather &quot;Mongoloïd type&quot;. He was crowned with a gilded copper tiara decorated with six winged, horned and hoofed lions (&quot;lion griffins&quot;). The lion griffins were made of wood, but were originally covered in gold foil before the foils were looted by tomb robbers. A false beard, made of hair, sinew thread and leather, was also discovered next to him in his tomb. Its significance remaining conjectural, as all mummies recovered from Pazyryk were clean-shaven. An extraordinary male headgear, a carved wooden crest representing a bird of prey with a deer head in its beak, was also found at the head of the coffin, and is thought to be the headgear of the chieftain.

===Pazyryk-5===

Pazyryk barrow 5 also contained the remains of a Saka chief. It was excavated by S.I. Rudenko in 1949. 

The grave was formed of an inner and an outer log sarcophagus, covered with five layers of logs and a layer of boulders. The tomb was looted in antiquity, but still contained the enbalmed remains of a man and a women, together with some artifacts, nine horses, either harnessed to chariot or back riding, a disassembled wagon with four large wheels on spokes, and various carpets.
===Ice Maiden===
The most famous undisturbed Pazyryk burial so far recovered is the Ice Maiden or &quot;Altai Lady&quot; found by archaeologist Natalia Polosmak in 1993 at Ukok, near the Chinese border. The find was a rare example of a single woman given a full ceremonial burial in a wooden chamber tomb in the fifth century BCE, accompanied by six horses.
She had been buried over 2,400 years ago in a casket fashioned from the hollowed-out trunk of a Siberian larch tree. On the outside of the casket were stylized images of deer and snow leopards carved in leather. Shortly after burial the grave had apparently been flooded by freezing rain, and the entire contents of the burial chamber had remained frozen in permafrost. Six horses wearing elaborate harnesses had been sacrificed and lay to the north of the chamber. 
The maiden&#x27;s well-preserved body, carefully embalmed with peat and bark, was arranged to lie on her side as if asleep. She was young, and her hair had been shaved off but she was wearing a wig and tall hat; she had been tall. Even the animal style tattoos were preserved on her pale skin: creatures with horns that develop into flowered forms. Her coffin was made large enough to accommodate the high felt headdress she was wearing, which was decorated with swans and gold-covered carved cats. She was clad in a long crimson and white striped woolen skirt and white felt stockings. Her yellow blouse was originally thought to be made of wild &quot;tussah&quot; silk but closer examination of the fibers indicate the material is not Chinese but was a wild silk which came from somewhere else, perhaps India. Near her coffin was a vessel made of yak horn, and dishes containing gifts of coriander seeds: all of which suggest that the Pazyryk trade routes stretched across vast areas of Iran. Similar dishes in other tombs were thought to have held &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot;, confirming a practice described by Herodotus but after tests the mixture was found to be coriander seeds, probably used to disguise the smell of the body.

Two years after the discovery of the &quot;Ice Maiden&quot; Dr. Polosmak&#x27;s husband, Vyacheslav Molodin, found a frozen man, elaborately tattooed with an elk, with two long braids that reached to his waist, buried with his weapons.

Dr Anicua also noted that her blouse was a bit stained, indicating that the material was not a new garment, made for the burial.

===Pazyryk rug===

One of the most famous finds at Pazyryk is the Pazyryk rug, which is probably the oldest surviving pile carpet in the world. According to some sources, it was manufactured in Ancient Armenia, using the Armenian double knot and Armenian cochineal for the red color. According to another source, it is an imported Persian work because of its decoration. It measures and has a knot density of approximately 360,000 knots per square meter, which is higher than most modern carpets. The middle of the rug consists of a ribbon motif, while in the border there is a procession with elk or deer, and in another border warriors on horses. When it was found it had been deeply frozen in a block of ice, which is why it is so well-preserved. The rug can be seen at the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

===Other findings===
In a corner of one grave chamber of the Pazyryk cemetery was a fur bag containing coriander seed, a censer filled with stones, and the hexapod frame of an inhalation tent – these are believed to have been utilized at the end of the funerary ritual for purification.

Other undisturbed kurgans have been found to contain remarkably well-preserved remains, comparable to the earlier Tarim mummies of Xinjiang. Bodies were preserved using mummification techniques and were also naturally frozen in solid ice from water seeping into the tombs. They were encased in coffins made from hollowed trunks of larch (which may have had sacral significance) and sometimes accompanied by sacrificed concubines and horses. The clustering of tombs in a single area implies that it had particular ritual significance for these people, who were likely to have been willing to transport their deceased leaders great distances for burial.

As recently as the summer of 2012, tombs have been discovered at various locations. In January 2007 a timber tomb of a blond chieftain warrior was unearthed in the permafrost of the Altai mountains region close to the Mongolian border. The body of the presumed Pazyryk chieftain is tattooed; his sable coat is well preserved, as are some other objects, including what looks like scissors. A local archaeologist, Aleksei Tishkin, complained that the indigenous population of the region strongly disapproves of archaeological digs, prompting the scientists to move their activities across the border to Mongolia.

<text>In biology, cell theory is a scientific theory first formulated in the mid-nineteenth century, that living organisms are made up of cells, that they are the basic structural/organizational unit of all organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells. Cells are the basic unit of structure in all living organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction.

Cell theory has traditionally been accepted as the governing theory of all life, but some biologists consider non-cellular entities such as viruses living organisms and thus disagree with the universal application of cell theory to all forms of life.

==History==

With continual improvements made to microscopes over time, magnification technology became advanced enough to discover cells. This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke, and began the scientific study of cells, known as cell biology. When observing a piece of cork under the scope, he was able to see pores. This was shocking at the time as it was believed no one else had seen these. To further support his theory, Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann both also studied cells of both animal and plants. What they discovered were significant differences between the two types of cells. This put forth the idea that cells were not only fundamental to plants, but animals as well.

== Microscopes==

The discovery of the cell was made possible through the invention of the microscope. In the first century BC, Romans were able to make glass. They discovered that objects appeared to be larger under the glass. The expanded use of lenses in eyeglasses in the 13th century probably led to wider spread use of simple microscopes (magnifying glasses) with limited magnification. Compound microscopes, which combine an objective lens with an eyepiece to view a real image achieving much higher magnification, first appeared in Europe around 1620. In 1665, Robert Hooke used a microscope about six inches long with two convex lenses inside and examined specimens under reflected light for the observations in his book &quot;Micrographia&quot;. Hooke also used a simpler microscope with a single lens for examining specimens with directly transmitted light, because this allowed for a clearer image.

An extensive microscopic study was done by Anton van Leeuwenhoek, a draper who took the interest in microscopes after seeing one while on an apprenticeship in Amsterdam in 1648. At some point in his life before 1668, he was able to learn how to grind lenses. This eventually led to Leeuwenhoek making his own unique microscope. He made one with a single lens. He was able to use a single lens that was a small glass sphere but allowed for a magnification of 270x. This was a large progression since the magnification before was only a maximum of 50x. After Leeuwenhoek, there was not much progress in microscope technology until the 1850s, two hundred years later. Carl Zeiss, a German engineer who manufactured microscopes, began to make changes to the lenses used. But the optical quality did not improve until the 1880s when he hired Otto Schott and eventually Ernst Abbe.

Optical microscopes can focus on objects the size of a wavelength or larger, giving restrictions still to advancement in discoveries with objects smaller than the wavelengths of visible light. The development of the electron microscope in the 1920s made it possible to view objects that are smaller than optical wavelengths, once again opening up new possibilities in science.

== Discovery of cells ==

The cell was first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665, which can be found to be described in his book &quot;Micrographia&quot;. In this book, he gave 60 observations in detail of various objects under a coarse, compound microscope. One observation was from very thin slices of bottle cork. Hooke discovered a multitude of tiny pores that he named &quot;cells&quot;. This came from the Latin word &quot;Cella&quot;, meaning ‘a small room’ like monks lived in, and also &quot;Cellulae&quot;, which meant the six-sided cell of a honeycomb. However, Hooke did not know their real structure or function. What Hooke had thought were cells, were actually empty cell walls of plant tissues. With microscopes during this time having a low magnification, Hooke was unable to see that there were other internal components to the cells he was observing. Therefore, he did not think the &quot;cellulae&quot; were alive. His cell observations gave no indication of the nucleus and other organelles found in most living cells. In &quot;Micrographia&quot;, Hooke also observed mould, bluish in color, found on leather. After studying it under his microscope, he was unable to observe &quot;seeds&quot; that would have indicated how the mould was multiplying in quantity. This led to Hooke suggesting that spontaneous generation, from either natural or artificial heat, was the cause. Since this was an old Aristotelian theory still accepted at the time, others did not reject it and was not disproved until Leeuwenhoek later discovered that generation was achieved otherwise.

Anton van Leeuwenhoek is another scientist who saw these cells soon after Hooke did. He made use of a microscope containing improved lenses that could magnify objects 270-fold. Under these microscopes, Leeuwenhoek found motile objects. In a letter to The Royal Society on October 9, 1676, he states that motility is a quality of life therefore these were living organisms. Over time, he wrote many more papers which described many specific forms of microorganisms. Leeuwenhoek named these &quot;animalcules,&quot; which included protozoa and other unicellular organisms, like bacteria. Though he did not have much formal education, he was able to identify the first accurate description of red blood cells and discovered bacteria after gaining interest in the sense of taste that resulted in Leeuwenhoek to observe the tongue of an ox, then leading him to study &quot;pepper water&quot; in 1676. He also found for the first time the sperm cells of animals and humans. Once discovering these types of cells, Leeuwenhoek saw that the fertilization process requires the sperm cell to enter the egg cell. This put an end to the previous theory of spontaneous generation. After reading letters by Leeuwenhoek, Hooke was the first to confirm his observations that were thought to be unlikely by other contemporaries.

Cells in animal tissues were observed later than those in plants because their tissues are fragile and difficult to study. Biologists believed that there was a fundamental unit to life, but until Henri Dutrochet were unclear what it was. Besides stating “the cell is the fundamental element of organization”, Dutrochet claimed that cells were also a physiological unit.

In 1804, Karl Rudolphi and J. H. F. Link were awarded the prize for &quot;solving the problem of the nature of cells&quot;, meaning they were the first to prove that cells had independent cell walls by the Königliche Societät der Wissenschaft (Royal Society of Science), Göttingen. Before, it had been thought that cells shared walls and the fluid passed between them this way.

== Cell theory ==

Credit for developing cell theory is usually given to two scientists: Theodor Schwann and Matthias Jakob Schleiden. While Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory, he is not as credited for his attributions toward it. In 1839, Schleiden suggested that every structural part of a plant was made up of cells or the result of cells. He also suggested that cells were made by a crystallization process either within other cells or from the outside. However, this was not an original idea of Schleiden. He claimed this theory as his own, though Barthelemy Dumortier had stated it years before him. This crystallization process is no longer accepted with modern cell theory. In 1839, Theodor Schwann states that along with plants, animals are composed of cells or the product of cells in their structures. This was a major advance in the field of biology since little was known about animal structure up to this point compared to plants. From these conclusions about plants and animals, two of the three tenets of cell theory were postulated.

:1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells
:2. The cell is the most basic unit of life

Schleiden&#x27;s theory of free cell formation through crystallization was refuted in the 1850s by Robert Remak, Rudolf Virchow, and Albert Kolliker. In 1855, Rudolf Virchow added the third tenet to cell theory. In Latin, this tenet states &quot;Omnis cellula e cellula&quot;. This translated to:

:3. All cells arise only from pre-existing cells

However, the idea that all cells come from pre-existing cells had already been proposed by Robert Remak; it has been suggested that Virchow plagiarized Remak. Remak published observations in 1852 on cell division, claiming Schleiden and Schawnn were incorrect about generation schemes. He instead said that binary fission, which was first introduced by Dumortier, was how reproduction of new animal cells were made. Once this tenet was added, classical cell theory was complete.

== Modern interpretation ==

The generally accepted parts of modern cell theory include:

# All known living things are made up of one or more cells
# All living cells arise from pre-existing cells by division. 
# The cell is the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms.
# The activity of an organism depends on the total activity of independent cells.
# Energy flow (metabolism and biochemistry) occurs within cells.
# Cells contain DNA which is found specifically in the chromosome and RNA found in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm.
# All cells are basically the same in chemical composition in organisms of similar species.

== Opposing concepts ==

The cell was first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665 using a microscope. The first cell theory is credited to the work of Theodor Schwann and Matthias Jakob Schleiden in the 1830s. In this theory the internal contents of cells were called protoplasm and described as a jelly-like substance, sometimes called living jelly. At about the same time, colloidal chemistry began its development, and the concepts of bound water emerged. A colloid being something between a solution and a suspension, where Brownian motion is sufficient to prevent sedimentation.
The idea of a semipermeable membrane, a barrier that is permeable to solvent but impermeable to solute molecules was developed at about the same time. The term osmosis originated in 1827 and its importance to physiological phenomena realized, but it wasn’t until 1877, when the botanist Pfeffer proposed the membrane theory of cell physiology. In this view, the cell was seen to be enclosed by a thin surface, the plasma membrane, and cell water and solutes such as a potassium ion existed in a physical state like that of a dilute solution. In 1889 Hamburger used hemolysis of erythrocytes to determine the permeability of various solutes. By measuring the time required for the cells to swell past their elastic limit, the rate at which solutes entered the cells could be estimated by the accompanying change in cell volume. He also found that there was an apparent nonsolvent volume of about 50% in red blood cells and later showed that this includes water of hydration in addition to the protein and other nonsolvent components of the cells.

=== Membrane and bulk phase theories ===

Two opposing concepts developed within the context of studies on osmosis, permeability, and electrical properties of cells. The first held that these properties all belonged to the plasma membrane whereas the other predominant view was that the protoplasm was responsible for these properties. The membrane theory developed as a succession of ad-hoc additions and changes to the theory to overcome experimental hurdles. Overton (a distant cousin of Charles Darwin) first proposed the concept of a lipid (oil) plasma membrane in 1899. The major weakness of the lipid membrane was the lack of an explanation of the high permeability to water, so Nathansohn (1904) proposed the mosaic theory. In this view, the membrane is not a pure lipid layer, but a mosaic of areas with lipid and areas with semipermeable gel. Ruhland refined the mosaic theory to include pores to allow additional passage of small molecules. Since membranes are generally less permeable to anions, Leonor Michaelis concluded that ions are adsorbed to the walls of the pores, changing the permeability of the pores to ions by electrostatic repulsion. Michaelis demonstrated the membrane potential (1926) and proposed that it was related to the distribution of ions across the membrane.

Harvey and Danielli (1939) proposed a lipid bilayer membrane covered on each side with a layer of protein to account for measurements of surface tension. In 1941 Boyle and Conway showed that the membrane of frog muscle was permeable to both and , but apparently not to , so the idea of electrical charges in the pores was unnecessary since a single critical pore size would explain the permeability to , , and as well as the impermeability to , , and .
Over the same time period, it was shown (Procter and Wilson, 1916) that gels, which do not have a semipermeable membrane, would swell in dilute solutions.

Jacques Loeb (1920) also studied gelatin extensively, with and without a membrane, showing that more of the properties attributed to the plasma membrane could be duplicated in gels without a membrane. In particular, he found that an electrical potential difference between the gelatin and the outside medium could be developed, based on the concentration. Some criticisms of the membrane theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations such as the ability of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties). Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties.

In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined form—the protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and water—and demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and fibrin gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.
By the 1940s, the bulk phase theories were not as well developed as the membrane theories. In 1941, Brooks and Brooks published a monograph, &quot;The Permeability of Living Cells&quot;, which rejects the bulk phase theories.

===Steady-state membrane pump concept ===

With the development of radioactive tracers, it was shown that cells are not impermeable to . This was difficult to explain with the membrane barrier theory, so the sodium pump was proposed to continually remove as it permeates cells. This drove the concept that cells are in a state of dynamic equilibrium, constantly using energy to maintain ion gradients. In 1935, discovered ATP and its role as a source of energy for cells, so the concept of a metabolically-driven sodium pump was proposed.
The success of Hodgkin, Huxley, and Katz in the development of the membrane theory of cellular membrane potentials, with differential equations that modeled the phenomena correctly, provided further support for the membrane pump hypothesis.
The modern view of the plasma membrane is of a fluid lipid bilayer that has protein components embedded within it. The structure of the membrane is now known in great detail, including 3D models of many of the hundreds of different proteins that are bound to the membrane.
These major developments in cell physiology placed the membrane theory in a position of dominance and stimulated the imagination of most physiologists, who now apparently accept the theory as fact—there are, however, a few dissenters.

=== Reemergence of bulk phase theories ===

In 1956, Afanasy S. Troshin published a book, &quot;The Problems of Cell Permeability&quot;, in Russian, in which he showed that permeability was of secondary importance in determining the patterns of equilibrium between the cell and its environment. Troshin showed that cell water decreased in solutions of galactose or urea although these compounds did slowly permeate cells. Since the membrane theory requires an impermanent solute to sustain cell shrinkage, these experiments cast doubt on the theory. Others questioned whether the cell has enough energy to sustain the sodium/potassium pump. Such questions became even more urgent as dozens of new metabolic pumps were added as new chemical gradients were discovered.

In 1962, Gilbert Ling became the champion of the bulk phase theories and proposed his association-induction hypothesis of living cells.

<text>The Evolution Control Committee (The ECC) is an experimental music band based in Columbus, Ohio. The ECC was founded by Mark Gunderson (a.k.a. TradeMark G.) in Columbus in 1986. They create music that falls within the borders of the sound collage genre, typically using uncleared and illegal samples from various sources as a form of protest against copyright law. The ECC also produces numerous audio experiments that goes outside regular composition methods, including the disfiguring of compact discs in a live performance known as &quot;CDestruction&quot;. They have produced a few video works as well, ranging from re-edited 50&#x27;s corporate shorts to Teddy Ruxpin reciting the works of William S. Burroughs. Other activities include culture jamming.

They are one of the pioneers of the mash-up or bootleg, where two or more songs are mixed together into a new track. According to Neil Strauss in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;...many musical observers trace the official beginnings of the British bootleg scene to The Evolution Control Committee, which in 1993 mixed a Public Enemy a cappella with music by Herb Alpert.&quot; These are the now-classic &quot;Public Enemy/Whipped Cream Mixes&quot; containing Public Enemy&#x27;s inflammatory raps titled &quot;By the Time I Get To Arizona&quot; and &quot;Rebel Without a Pause&quot; overdubbed onto instrumentals by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass.

The ECC wrote &quot;Rocked by Rape,&quot; consisting of samples of Dan Rather&#x27;s deadpan delivery describing various atrocities over looped riffs from AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Back in Black.&quot; This work brought legal threats against The ECC by CBS, but by 2003, CBS appeared to have dropped the issue. &quot;Rocked by Rape&quot; was nationally broadcast on NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; in 2000. It was even played at a roast for Rather, later broadcast on C-SPAN.

Since 2000, Gunderson has performed his works on stage through an electronic instrument of his own invention: &quot;The Thimbletron.&quot; It is made of a pair of gloves with ten thimbles attached at the ends of the fingers that are then wired to a laptop computer. As the thimbles are touched together, the laptop in turn plays a different sound sample. Gunderson claims that the device uses &quot;thimbletronium energy&quot; and warns that &quot;thimbletronic radiation can leak unexpectedly due to a mishap during a live performance. The audience is advised to attend Thimbletron performances at their own risk.&quot; Gunderson has also modified a bread toaster in a similar fashion, with each depression of a lever playing a sample.

The Thimbletron has been largely retired in public performances in favor of the Wheel of Mashup in which audience members come up on stage and spin a wheel to randomly select the music and vocals to be combined. These are then mashed together in real time using the VidiMasher 3000, a large rear-projected touch screen used to control Ableton Live. VidiMasher 3000 (Video Mashup Screen) Demo

<text>The Universities of Wisconsin (officially the University of Wisconsin System and sometimes referred to as the UW System) is a university system of public universities in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. It is one of the largest public higher-education systems in the country, enrolling more than 160,000 students each year and employing approximately 41,000 faculty and staff statewide. The system is headquartered in the state capital of Madison.

The UW System comprises two major doctoral research universities, eleven other comprehensive universities, and twelve two-year branch campuses.

== History ==

The present-day University of Wisconsin System was created on October 11, 1971, by Chapter 100, Laws of 1971, which combined the former University of Wisconsin and Wisconsin State Universities systems into an enlarged University of Wisconsin System. The final legislation passed in May 1974, combining two chapters of the Wisconsin statutes. The merger took effect July 9, 1974.

=== Former University of Wisconsin ===
The University of Wisconsin was created by the state constitution in 1848, and held its first classes in Madison in 1849.

In 1956, pressed by the growing demand for a large public university that offered graduate programs in Milwaukee, Wisconsin&#x27;s largest city, Wisconsin lawmakers merged Wisconsin State College of Milwaukee (WSCM) and the University of Wisconsin–Extension&#x27;s Milwaukee division as the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. The new campus comprised the WSCM campus near the lakefront and the UW extension in downtown Milwaukee.

Starting in the 1940s, freshman-sophomore centers were opened across the state. In 1968, the Green Bay center was upgraded to a full-fledged four-year institution as the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay, while the Kenosha and Racine centers were merged as the University of Wisconsin–Parkside. By 1971, the University of Wisconsin system had campuses at Madison, Milwaukee, Green Bay and Kenosha/Somers, together with 10 freshman-sophomore centers and the statewide University of Wisconsin–Extension. The total enrollment of the University of Wisconsin system at that time was 69,554. The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin system comprise ten members, nine of whom were appointed by the governor and confirmed by the senate for nine-year terms. The tenth was the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, who served &quot;ex officio&quot; on both the University of Wisconsin and Wisconsin State University boards.

=== Former Wisconsin State Universities ===
In 1866, the state legislature established a normal school at Platteville—the first of eight teacher-training schools across the state. In 1911, the legislature permitted the normal schools to offer two years of post-high school work in art, liberal arts and sciences, pre-law, and pre-medicine. The broadened curriculum proved popular and soon accounted for over one-third of the normal schools&#x27; enrollment. In 1920, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching issued a report on &quot;The Professional Education of Teachers of American Public Schools&quot;, which attacked such programs, arguing that normal schools should not deviate from their purpose as trainers of teachers. When the Milwaukee Normal School (MNS) persisted with its popular enhanced curriculum, the regents of the Normal School system, the legislature, and the governor all became involved. MNS President Carroll G. Pearse was forced to resign in 1923, and the regents ordered the discontinuation of non-teacher-education programs. The issue was not settled, though; public pressure for expanded offerings at normal schools continued to grow, and education professionals asserted that traditional two-year curricula in teacher training were inadequate.

In 1926, the regents repurposed the Normal Schools as &quot;State Teachers Colleges&quot;, offering a four-year course of study leading to a Bachelor of Education degree that incorporated significant general education at all levels. The thousands of returning World War II veterans in Wisconsin needed more college choices for their studies under the G.I. Bill, and popular demand pushed the State Teachers College system Regents to once again allow the teacher training institutions to offer bachelor&#x27;s degrees in liberal arts and fine arts. In 1951 the state teachers colleges were redesignated as &quot;Wisconsin State Colleges,&quot; offering a full four-year liberal arts curriculum. In 1955, the Stout Institute in Menomonie, which had been founded as a private engineering school in 1891 and was sold to the state in 1911, was merged into the Wisconsin State Colleges system; it had previously been governed by a separate state board of regents.

The state colleges were all granted university status as &quot;Wisconsin State Universities&quot; in 1964 (with the exception of Wisconsin State College-Milwaukee, which had become part of the University of Wisconsin in 1956).

As of 1971, the Wisconsin State Universities comprised nine public universities (Platteville, Whitewater, Oshkosh, River Falls, Stout (in Menomonie), Superior, Stevens Point, La Crosse, and Eau Claire) and four freshman-sophomore branch campuses, with a total enrollment of 64,148. The board was made up of 14 members, 13 of whom were appointed by the governor and confirmed by the senate for five-year terms. The 14th was the State Superintendent of Public Instruction.

=== Merger ===
The University of Wisconsin system merged with the Wisconsin State University system in 1971 to create today&#x27;s University of Wisconsin System. The 1971 merger law approved by the State Senate combined the two higher education systems in Wisconsin under a single Board of Regents, creating a system with 13 universities, 14 freshman-sophomore centers (as University of Wisconsin Colleges), and a statewide extension with offices in all 72 counties. Each university is named &quot;University of Wisconsin–&quot; followed by the location or name. Each two-year college was named &quot;University of Wisconsin–&quot; followed by the city and/or county in which it is located. The move, intended to enhance the University of Wisconsin&#x27;s prestige and influence, was resisted by some parties concerned with a possible brand dilution.

The Board of the University of Wisconsin System includes 18 members, 16 of whom are appointed by the Governor and approved by the Senate. Of these 16 members, 14 serve staggered, seven-year terms. The remaining two are two-year positions filled by current UW System students. The two &quot;ex officio&quot; members are the State Superintendent of Public Instruction and the president or a designee of the Wisconsin Technical College System Board.

=== 2018 restructuring ===
In October 2017, UW System president Ray Cross publicly proposed restructuring the University of Wisconsin System to bring the UW Colleges under the control of their nearest comprehensive university, creating regional two-year campuses within the system. The proposal also included splitting UW-Extension between UW-Madison and UW System administration. UW Colleges Online, which was operating as an additional campus of UW Colleges, would be relocated under UW System administration. Cross announced this proposal without consulting shared governance groups or administrators. System administration argued that the merger would save money. Critics said the merger was being rushed without input from the campuses and that the system was buckling to political pressure from the state. The proposal was approved by the UW Board of Regents in their November 2017 meeting, and implementation began July 1, 2018.

== Branding ==
Since the 1971 union of the universities and colleges under the University of Wisconsin System name, there has been a controversy over the arrangement. The name &quot;University of Wisconsin&quot; is often used to refer to the Madison campus, which has made it difficult for other institutions to make names for themselves. Conversely, many who are connected to UW–Madison have claimed that having so many institutions share the &quot;University of Wisconsin&quot; title has caused a form of brand dilution.

In 2006 and 2009, the students at UW–Milwaukee (UWM) voted on whether the school should change its name to something that did not carry the UW name (such as Wisconsin State University or University of Milwaukee). In both cases, a plurality of students voted to retain the name &quot;University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee,&quot; but over 50% were in favor of a different name. Since 2004, the UWM athletic department has simply referred to the school&#x27;s athletic teams as the Milwaukee Panthers. UW–Green Bay has since done the same and are officially the Green Bay Phoenix. Most other UW system programs are commonly referred to by just the city name as they all play in the same conference, the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WIAC), making the &quot;UW&quot; redundant. The exceptions are UW–Parkside, who plays in the Division II Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference and is most often referred to as simply &quot;Parkside&quot;, and UW-Superior, who plays most athletics in the Upper Midwest Athletic Conference, who go by UWS or Wisconsin–Superior.

In October 2023, system president Jay Rothman announced that the system would be rebranded as &quot;Universities of Wisconsin&quot;, adopting a new logo and color scheme. The legal name of the system would remain unchanged.

<doc id="102864" wikidata="Q1462707" url="?curid=102864" title="Shazam (wizard)">
<text>Shazam (), also known as The Wizard or Wizard Shazam, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Fawcett Comics and DC Comics, first appearing in &quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #2 (February, 1940) created by C.C. Beck and Bill Parker. A major supporting character in &quot;Shazam!&quot; comic book titles, he often serves as a wise old man archetype. 

The original version of the character was Jebediah, a young boy who of Egyptian and Canaanite origin who served as the Champion, gaining his power through Canaanite gods. In his later years, he forgoes their powers and learned wizardry before seeking a successor to empower. A revised version of the character is introduced after the New 52. At first introduced as a Kahndaq native who ascended to godhood, this origin was retconned and he is revealed to be Mamaragan, a figure based upon the deity in Kunwinjku culture. This version served as a adjudicator on Earth&#x27;s supernatural matters as leader of a cabal of six other wizards, making up the Council of Eternity until a betrayal forces him to seek a successor to both his power and the fallen Council. Although the character&#x27;s motivations and background history differ, they&#x27;re intended to be incarnations of the same character. 

The core of the character serves as an ancient sorcerer who battled the forces of evils for centuries until the betrayal of Black Adam, one of his earliest champion and proposed successors, forced him to seal him away and seek another champion to take his place. This would eventually come in the form of Billy Batson, who becomes the hero known as Captain Marvel/Shazam, and the rest of the Marvel Family (currently known as the Shazam Family). He often serves as a mentor to the group and is a notable member of the Quintessence, a powerful group of beings who watch over events unfolding in the universe.

The Shazam character has been featured in various media and adaptations relating DC Comics series. The original Golden Age incarnation has appeared in live television serial such as the &quot;Adventures of Captain Marvel&quot;, portrayed by Nigel De Brulier. He also appeared in animated features such as &quot;Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam&quot;, voiced by James Garner. Notably, Djimon Hounsou portrayed the character in DC Extended Universe films &quot;Shazam!&quot; (2019), &quot;Black Adam&quot; (2022), and &quot;Shazam! Fury of the Gods&quot; (2023) whose appearance and portrayal is inspired by the New 52&#x27;s earlier version of the character.

==Publication history==
Created in the 1940s by Bill Parker and C. C. Beck for Fawcett Comics, he is an ancient wizard (&quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #2 gives his age as 3,000 years) who gives young Billy Batson the power to transform into Captain Marvel. Despite the new comic&#x27;s popularity and theatrical success, Captain Marvel was similar enough to Superman that a court ruled against Fawcett in 1952. Two decades after gaining the rights to Captain Marvel, DC Comics began publishing new stories under the title &quot;Shazam!&quot;. This became a problem for DC&#x27;s lawyers, as the company had abandoned any rights to the Captain Marvel name, and it was now owned by rival Marvel Comics.

While not part of the first wave of DC&#x27;s The New 52 2011 line wide relaunch, it was announced at New York Comic Con on October 15, 2011, that Billy Batson would be featured in a backup story, &quot;The Curse of Shazam!&quot; beginning in &quot;Justice League&quot; (vol. 2) #7 in March 2012. It was confirmed by Geoff Johns, DC Comics&#x27; chief creative officer and the author of the story, that Billy Batson&#x27;s alter ego would be called &quot;Shazam&quot; rather than &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; from now on. In DC&#x27;s, 2012 Free Comic Book Day offering called &quot;The New 52 FCBD Special&quot; #1, it was revealed that seven wizards representing seven different mythologies occupied the Rock of Eternity at the dawn of time in The New 52. They harnessed the power of magic to cast out a &quot;Trinity of Sin&quot;, which acted as a precursor to the 2013 &quot;Trinity War&quot; crossover event. A younger version of the Wizard is part of this group of wizards.

Both the wizard and his champion shared the name &quot;Shazam&quot; in the comic book stories published from then until June 2013, but the Wizard later revealed that &quot;Shazam&quot; is an adopted name, and that his original name is Mamaragan.

==Fictional character biography==

=== Golden Age ===

==== Fawcett Comics history ====
Originally, the wizard&#x27;s name was Shazamo, the last letter standing for the hero of magic Oggar. However, Oggar became corrupt and tried to take power from Shazamo. The wizard defeated Oggar and cursed him to live in the world of mortals. He was given cloven hooves as a sign of his inner evil, and could cast each magic spell only once. Shazamo then dropped the last letter of his name.

Shazam informs Billy that he is an ancient Egyptian wizard who has been using his powers for many centuries to fight the forces of evil, but that he is now old and not long for this world. He therefore passes along part of his power to Billy, who shouts his name– &quot;SHAZAM!&quot;– to transform into Captain Marvel/Shazam. He also then explains to Billy that his name: is an acronym for six ancient heroes. Each letter empowers him with certain attributes:

:S The wisdom of Solomon;
:H The strength of Hercules;
:A The stamina of Atlas;
:Z The power of Zeus;
:A The courage of Achilles;
:M The speed of Mercury.
Although Shazam is killed, as prophesied, by a giant granite block falling on him, Billy/Captain Marvel/Shazam can summon the ghost of Shazam for guidance by lighting a special brazier in Shazam&#x27;s lair (the Rock of Eternity). More superheroes soon joined the superhero Shazam in carrying on the legacy of the wizard Shazam, including Shazam Family members Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr. Shazam tells that once, 5,000 years before, he gave powers to Black Adam, but Black Adam was killed while turning back to his regular self. He died due to his advanced age. +In the Marvel Family series, he was shown in some early issues carving the Marvel Family adventures into the Rock of Eternity.

==== Post-Crisis origin and early history ====

In a story written by E. Nelson Bridwell for &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #262 (cover date April/May 1980), his gave him a backstory in which he was a young shepherd who becomes the Champion, one of the world&#x27;s first superheroes in ancient Canaan, over 5,000 years ago. By speaking the magic word &quot;VLAREM!&quot; (an anagram of &quot;Marvel&quot;). This background is later explored further in the &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; series, in which detailed during his tenure as a Champion, At one point, the Champion is seduced by a demoness disguised as a beautiful woman, and the two of them conceive two half-demon offspring, Blaze and Satanus, much to the displeasure of the gods. The Champion later creates the Rock of Eternity from two large rock formations – one from Heaven and one from Hell – to hold the Three Faces of Evil, a dragon-like demon whose mother is the same demoness as the one who bore his children, captive. Shazam also later trapped demons of the Seven Deadly Sins in statues of themselves and imprisoned them at the Rock of Eternity.

Many centuries later, the Champion, now going by the name of &quot;Shazam&quot;, feels the need to pass along his powers to a successor. He selects the pharaoh&#x27;s son Teth-Adam to receive the power to become the superpowered Mighty Adam by speaking the word &quot;SHAZAM!&quot; However, Blaze interferes with this succession and Adam is given powers from the Egyptian deities instead. As her mother did, Shazam&#x27;s daughter Blaze takes on the form of a beautiful woman and seduces Adam, convincing him to kill the pharaoh and take over the kingdom. An angry Shazam draws Mighty-Adam&#x27;s powers out of him and into a large jeweled scarab, thereby killing Adam as he ages to death. Shazam then seals his remains and the amulet in a tomb. A wicked reincarnation of Teth-Adam named Theo Adam would steal the scarab many centuries later and use the power of Shazam to become Black Adam. Shazam was upset by this and did not consider passing on his powers for millennia.
The wizard resurfaces as an aide on the 1940 Malcolm Expedition, one of many archaeological expeditions into the tombs and pyramids of ancient Egypt. The sarcophagi of Ibis the Invincible and his mate Princess Taia are uncovered and brought to the United States. Shazam follows the sarcophagi. Once they are on display at the Fawcett City Museum, Shazam uses ancient spells to resurrect Ibis. Ibis then joins Bulletman, Spy Smasher, Minute-Man, and others to fight evil during the World War II era. In 1955, a thug knocks a weakened Shazam across the head with a crowbar and causes him to lose his memory. A clueless Shazam wanders around Fawcett for the next forty years until C.C. Batson, a young man Shazam had met on the Malcolm Expedition, recognizes the old man and brings him to the museum to restore his memory. Shazam feels that he has truly found his successor in the upstanding Batson, but before he can act on this, a possessed Theo Adam murders Batson and his wife Marilyn for the magic amulet. He therefore decides to enlist C.C. Batson&#x27;s young son, Billy, as the successor to his power.

==== &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot; ====
In &quot;Superman&quot; (vol. 2) #216, Shazam calls upon the Spectre to free Superman from being controlled by the demon Eclipso. This action breaks a covenant between Eclipso and the Spectre and sets Eclipso permanently at odds with the wizard. Possessing the body of Jean Loring, the Atom&#x27;s ex-wife, Eclipso corrupts the confused Spectre into joining forces with her, and begins a war against all magic-powered beings in the DC Universe.

Because of his previous action, Shazam is one of the duo&#x27;s primary targets. In the &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot; mini-series, Shazam enlists Captain Marvel to keep the Spectre at bay while the wizard gathers all of his power to battle him. With the assistance of the newly formed Shadowpact, a band of magic-based heroes, Captain Marvel fights the Spectre nearly to a standstill, but the Spectre escapes and makes his way to the Rock of Eternity to confront Shazam directly. While Shazam is preparing for his bout with the Spectre, he is confronted by Mordru who has just escaped the Rock of Eternity. Mordru and the wizard fight for a short time while the Spectre begins to approach, despite being delayed by fighting Captain Marvel. More concerned with escaping and staying out of the Spectre&#x27;s way, Mordru leaves a slightly wounded and tired Shazam to fight the Spectre, who is already more powerful than him at full power. The Spectre overpowers the wizard, absorbs his magics, and kills him. As a result, the Rock of Eternity disintegrates above Gotham City into &quot;a billion pieces&quot; and explodes, freeing the Seven Deadly Sins along with many other demons and sending a depowered Billy Batson falling into the city.

In &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #1, Billy finds he is still able to transform into the Captain before he strikes the ground by saying the wizard&#x27;s name as usual. It is also revealed that the entire affair was orchestrated by Alexander Luthor Jr. and the Psycho-Pirate to reduce magic to its raw form, the death of Shazam turning his name into a tether for the rest of the raw magic that Alexander could harness to power his tower by acquiring one of Shazam&#x27;s champions, eventually forcibly &#x27;enlisting&#x27; Black Adam for that purpose after failing to capture any of the other Marvels.

In &quot;Day of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special&quot;, the Shadowpact teams up with the majority of the DC Universe&#x27;s surviving magical characters to rebuild the Rock of Eternity and reseal the Seven Deadly Sins. The final piece of the reconstruction, revealed by Zatanna, is that a new wizard has to be appointed to guard the Rock. Billy, as the only real candidate, is chosen to succeed Shazam as the Rock&#x27;s new caretaker.

In the comic series &quot;52&quot;, Captain Marvel is revealed to be currently headquartered at the Rock of Eternity, acting in Shazam&#x27;s stead. He has already imprisoned the Sins again, although he claims they cause trouble at the full moon.

=== Post-Flashpoint ===
The Shazam character is late reintroduced within the New 52 onward, having several origins. The earliest origin cast Shazam as a Kahndaqi-born sorcerer who ascended to godhood and leads the Council of Eternity, a group of wizards overseeing mystic matters on Earth, and was a keeper of magic. An alternate origin was retroactiely introduced later, revealing himself to be the Kunwinjku deity Mamaragan. This retcon instead explains that the character&#x27;s songlines guided him to a seat on the Council of Eternity, where he adopted the title of &quot;Wizard&quot; and the name Shazam. One sources suggest both origins are known but the latter is the true one while another suggests he was a Kahndaqi-born wizard who became powerful enough to ascend to godhood early in his life, granting him both Kahndaqi and Aboriginal ties.

As leader of the Council, the character would be responsible for numerous incidents such as being the one to punish Phantom Stranger, an interpretation of Judas Iscariot, for his betrayal of Jesus Christ on behalf of the Presence and Pandora, based on Greek mythology, by granting her immortality and scars that constantly burn as a consequence of unleashing the Seven Deadly Sins upon humanity. In the latter case, he later believed his and the Council&#x27;s punishment was too harsh. He was also responsible for empowering the young Amun as his champion, who shared his with his uncle, Teth-Adam. Teth later killed his nephew to consolidate his power and became the Wizard&#x27;s primary champion. Teth eventually betrays the Council and kills them off save Shazam, who seals him away.

The &quot;Shazam!&quot; backup in the &quot;Justice League&quot; comic book title shows an elderly Shazam in the modern era later apologizing to Pandora for giving her a harsh punishment as his demise nears and Black Adam is resurrected by Dr. Sivanna and like past stories, he bestows his powers onto Billy Batson, whom is more abrasive and ill-mannered than previous incarnations but sees potential goodness in him. Unlike previous depictions, he explains to Billy he must say the word &quot;Shazam!&quot; with intent to transform, as the word itself won&#x27;t do so before seemingly passing on. 

He later appears in the &quot;Darkseid War&quot; crossover title, where he replaces Billy&#x27;s collection of god following Darkseid&#x27;s supposed death, which disrupted his connections to his old gods. Both Mamaragan and Billy come into conflict with Yuga Khan (known as Zonzu) when he wishes to usurp the Powers of Shazam. After his defeat, the wizard makes him part of Billy&#x27;s pantheon as pentice for his crimes and reveals his aboriginal ties and being among Billy&#x27;s new set of empowered gods. 

==== DC Rebirth onward ====
During DC Rebirth, he is also a member of the Council of Immortals. He also plays a significant role in the 2018 &quot;Shazam! and the Seven Magiclands&quot;&quot;&quot; storyline, revealing himself to the Shazam Family as they explore the titular Seven Magiclands. This set into motions of events plotted by Mister Mind and his Monster Society of Evil, manipulating events for the family to choose Billy&#x27;s biological father, C.C. Batson, as the seventh champion to gain access to their magic as his secret host while pitting the family against him. After he, the society, and surprise adversary Superboy Prime is defeated, Mamaragan becomes aware of a potential future with a redeemed Black Adam as the eventual seventh champion.

Mind disrupts the Wizard&#x27;s efforts to unearthing the threat and manipulates him and Billy into a clash which results in him being sealed away. Mamaragan watches the family battle the society and later a returned Superboy Prime, who was previously imprisoned with magic generating Red Sun energies. Remorseful of not trusting Billy, he comes to believe in his decision and witnesses a potential future where he helps redeems Black Adam and the Shazam Family becomes the spiritual successors of the Council of Eternity. Mamaragan is also referenced in the &quot;2021 Shazam!&quot; limited series, his presence disrupted when his future counterpart is killed by the Unkindness, a future version of Raven, as well as the Rock of Eternity being displaced, causing all of the Shazam Family&#x27;s power to be disrupted and unreliable. These references also restores his connections with Blaze and Satanus, with Billy referencing events connected to the past &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; comics and merging aspects of the Golden Age incarnation. 

In Infinite Frontier, Shazam is shown as a member of a reintroduced incarnation of the Quintessence and appears alongside other members shortly after the defeat of the Batman Who Laughs at the hands of Wonder Woman, whom is invited as a member. The heroine rejects it and shortly after taking her leave, the group is seemingly an empowered Darkseid. Later, it was revealed that the Quintessence was under the control of the Great Darkness (namely Pariah&#x27;s manipulation of a fraction of its power), eventually leading to the seemingly death of the core members of the Justice League. At the end of the event, after Pariah&#x27;s defeat and restoration of the Justice League members, the Quintessence, including the Wizard, was revived by the Spectre.

In the &quot;Black Adam&quot; limited ongoing series. The &quot;&quot;East of Egyp&quot;t&quot; storyline includes the Wizard in flashbacks set thousands of years before the present day, in which the events depicted are an altered version of the flashbacks depicted in &quot;Marvel Family #1&quot; (December, 1945). These flashbacks also explore Black Adam&#x27;s history as Mamaragan&#x27;s champion, Mighty Adam, with several changes made to previous accounts expressed earlier in the New 52 and DC Rebirth, including the methodology of how Black Adam was sealed away. After killing his nephew Aman, Black Adam deceived the Wizard and kept the truth hidden although he remained suspicious. He later betrayed the Council of Eternity, eliminating the others but sedates Mamaragan through magical potions. As pharaoh under the name &quot;Userkare,&quot; Black Adam was confronted by his vizier, Mereruka, who employed Ibac to force him to step down. Black Adam prevailed, but Ibac freed the Wizard and he banished Black Adam from Earth after a confrontation over Aman&#x27;s fate, sent among the stars.

In the &quot;Lazarus Planet&quot; crossover, the Wizard is unexpectedly ousted from his role as Keeper of the Rock of Eternity and believes Billy to be responsible. He aligns himself with Hera, who plans to depose Zeus and seek revenge on mortals. Billy and Yara Flor unite to stop Hera, but are surprised to find the Wizard on her side and Billy is subsequently depowered and captured. The Wizard is later summoned by Hera to enhance her powers against Wonder Woman, but when Hera&#x27;s agenda becomes unpopular, he doubts and abandons her. Billy later calls upon the Wizard through the Rock of Eternity, where it is revealed that the Wizard initially believed Billy had betrayed him. However, witnessing Mary sacrifice her powers to aid Wonder Woman, the Wizard realizes his mistake and deems Mary worthy to be the Champion. Despite his intention to empower both Billy and Mary, Hippolyta intervenes and chooses to bless Mary&#x27;s powers through her and seven other gods. Both Billy and Mary regain their powers, with Mary&#x27;s connection maintained through the blessings of the seven goddesses instead of the Wizard&#x27;s magic, despite still utilizing the &quot;SHAZAM&quot; method.

In the &quot;Shazam!&quot; 2023 comic book series, the Wizard makes a brief appearance and is mentioned by Billy Batson as he recalls his transformation into Shazam. The series reaffirms Billy&#x27;s previous origin of falling asleep in a subway, but with some subtle changes. These changes include acknowledging Billy&#x27;s status as a foster child from his New 52 origin and expressing reluctance regarding the Wizard&#x27;s intentions. It is revealed that the character eventually entrusts Billy with the Rock of Eternity, hoping that he will treat it with reverence.

== Characterization ==
The character is depicted as an ancient wizard who bestows powers upon several champions and a staunch defender against evil. In both incarnations of the character, he often seeks a worthy successor to his power and is unable to engage in active combat himself due to his advanced aging. In more recent stories, the character is also depicted to be more jaded and fickle due to the betrayal of Black Adam overtime, causing him to constantly question the worthiness of his chosen champions. This is a reoccurring conflict for the character in various storylines. 

Throughout the character&#x27;s history, the Wizard is depicted as a member of the Quintessence, a council of influential beings within the DC Multiverse. The Quintessence is renowned and considered among the most formidable entities in the universe, capable of slaying Darkseid individually. As such, the Wizard stands as a peer to other notable beings within the council such as the Phantom Stranger and the Spectre. 

=== Significant relationships ===

==== Billy Batson ====
One of the most significant relationships depicted in the &quot;Shazam!&quot; comic book series with Shazam is with Billy Batson. He often assumes the role of a mentor to Billy and provides assistance in the form of a ghost when needed, utilizing his supernatural knowledge to aid the young hero. In the &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; comic book title, the Golden Age version of the character extensively explores his connection with Billy. Alongside his mentorship, the character also expresses his thoughts on Billy&#x27;s worthiness of his power and even acts as his guardian, assuming the identity of &quot;Jebediah O&#x27;Keenan,&quot; posing as Billy Batson&#x27;s grandfather. In the modern version, the Wizard&#x27;s relationship with Billy Batson differs from previous iterations. Reluctantly, the Wizard grants Billy the power, considering his selfish tendencies resulting from a difficult upbringing. However, recognizing Billy&#x27;s potential for goodness and influenced by specific circumstances, the Wizard chooses him as his champion. 

Writer Steve Orlando, discussing their relationship in &quot;Darkseid War&quot;, described it as initially antagonistic but evolving into a &quot;pseudo father-and-son relationship.&quot; This makes the Wizard another parental figure in Billy&#x27;s life, alongside the Vasquez family.

==== Teth-Adam ====
The character Black Adam also serves to be significant to the Wizard, being the champion before Billy who was initially good but betrays him, influencing the character&#x27;s actions throughout the centuries as he searches for his replacement. This aspect is explored more extensively within the current version, where it depicts Teth Adam (then known as White Adam) as the secondary champion who ascended by killing Aman, the original chosen champion and his nephew. Unaware of what transpired, Shazam learns centuries later of his fate and seals Teth in return and renames him Black Adam. Although he despises Shazam, he also refers to him as a fatherly figure.

== Powers and abilities ==
The character is often depicted as a sorcerer with vast godly-level magical abilities, reality alteration powers, and immortality at his peak. In a diminished state, he is only capable of utilizing thunderbolts offensively and advising the Shazam/Marvel Family.

=== Powers of Shazam ===
The character&#x27;s most reoccurring power is the Powers of Shazam, a set of superpowers acquired from aspects of different divine entities and notable figure, either from mythology or original creations within the DC Universe, whose names align with the &quot;SHAZAM&quot; acronym. They have the ability to grant power to a chosen champion, whether willingly or under the coercion of the Wizard. When a champion is empowered, the associated divine entities are bound by specific parameters and rules that govern their connection to the champion. Following the New 52, the Powers of Shazam are retroactively associated with the Living Lightning, which is channeled through the distilled essence of six divine entities.
=== Golden Age version ===

==== Powers of VLAREM! ====
The Golden Age version of the character uses a predated version of the Powers of Shazam, in which instead used the acronym &quot;VLAREM&quot;, in which the combination aligns within that specific acronym derived from Cannanite gods. 
=== Modern version ===
Within the modern depictions of the character, he is described as a sorcerer transcending conventional notions of space-time, allowing for the simultaneous existence of different versions of him across the multiverse as a singular being and was potent enough to be one of the few characters to break Wonder Woman&#x27;s Lasso of Truth.

==== Living Lightning ====
The Living Lightning refers to the unique form of magic in the DC Universe often portrayed to be intrinsically tied to the Mamaragan, lineages of the Marvel Family, and the Rock of Eternity. Debuting in 2011 the New 52, the Rock of Eternity acts as a conduit of the magic and is connected to his life, as his death would result in the and disruption or cessation of these powers for any chosen empowered champion lest he has chosen a new heir to bear the power. The Living Lightning can take the form of a lightning bolt or lightning itself and possesses a wide array of magical abilities. These include spell-casting, enhancing specific powers, and more. It also has safeguards in place that deter usurpation, resulting in the slow demise of the usurper, even with the enhanced stamina provided by the Powers of Shazam.
In the New 52, the power associated with the Champion&#x27;s ability to share their power was retroactively attributed to a sharing spell. Selected champions have the ability to share their powers with their chosen family, and the power level depends on the number of individuals transformed at a given time. All champions draw from the same power pool. The strength of the power is influenced by the emotional connection between the champion and those they empower. The champions&#x27; powers can be disrupted by emotional distress related to these relationships. The Wizard Shazam bestows power upon a chosen champion, and once granted, it cannot be revoked. However, the Wizard can depower individuals who were included in the sharing spell. This limitation is established before the events of &quot;Lazarus Plane&quot;t.

=== Equipment and resources ===
*Staff of the Living Lightinng: Mamaragan possesses a mystical staff that acts as a focal point for his powers, although he is not reliant upon it.
* The Wizard&#x27;s Dagger: Mamaragan crafted a magical dagger that contains a portion of his magical power. Over time, the dagger has been in the possession of various individuals, including Batman and Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, but it has since been reclaimed by the Wizard. The power of the dagger grants him the capability to defeat powerful gods, as exemplified by his use of it to fulfill Hera&#x27;s request to slay Zeus.

==Other versions==

* In the &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; reality, Shazam is a member of the Quintessence and has been displeased that Billy Batson has been corrupted by Lex Luthor&#x27;s influence.
* In the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; timeline, the power of the six Elders is divided up between six children who say Shazam together to transform into Captain Thunder, similar to the Lieutenant Marvels. They claim to have gotten on the subway car to Shazam&#x27;s lair.

=== Marvel (Billy Batson) ===
After the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Billy assumes the role of the wizard Shazam, now known as Marvel, while Freddy Freeman, without powers, attempts to prove himself worthy of the Shazam powers and becomes the new Captain Marvel. Mary loses her powers and falls into a coma but later accepts power from Black Adam. In this new incarnation, Shazam resembles the original Captain Marvel, with only having long, white hair.

During the &quot;Trials of Shazam!&quot;, Sabina gains some Powers of Shazam with the help of the Council of Merlin. She kills Atlas, leading Freddy and Marvel to temporarily shoulder Atlas&#x27;s burden. Freddy convinces Apollo to take on Atlas&#x27;s burden, but Apollo shares his powers with Freddy and Sabina out of bitterness. Sabina and the Council of Merlin plot to assault New York City to disrupt the magical balance. The Justice League intervenes, and Freddy battles Sabina. Freddy sacrifices himself and is deemed the most worthy by Zeus, who grants him the full power of Shazam. Sabina is killed, and the demons disappear.

Later, Black Adam, Isis, and the corrupted Mary Marvel take control of the Rock of Eternity. Billy and Mary&#x27;s father recruits Jay Garrick to retrieve Shazam&#x27;s spirit from the Rock of Finality. Shazam is restored, removes powers from Isis and the Marvels, and turns Black Adam and Adrianna to stone. Shazam cuts off Billy and Mary&#x27;s access to his power, returns Stargirl to Earth, and mentions dealing with Freddy before closing the Rock of Eternity.

<text>Mölln () is a town in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is surrounded by several small lakes (Stadtsee, Schulsee, Ziegelsee, Hegesee, Schmalsee, Lütauer See, Drüsensee, and Pinnsee). The Elbe-Lübeck Canal flows through the town. Mölln belongs to the district of Herzogtum Lauenburg.

== History ==
The town was founded in the 12th century. It rapidly became an important town, due to the Old Salt Route, through which the salt produced in the salt mines of Lüneburg (Lower-Saxony) was shipped to the Baltic harbour of Lübeck, and the Stecknitz Canal, which was a precursor of today&#x27;s Elbe-Lübeck Canal. Although situated in the midst of the medieval duchy of Lauenburg, the town was mortgaged to the Hanseatic town of Lübeck, which ruled Mölln from 1359 to 1683. Back from this time dates the Möllner Schützengilde von 1407 e.V. which was founded over 600 years ago and still exists today with almost 300 members.

Mölln calls itself the Eulenspiegel town, because of Till Eulenspiegel, a legendary trickster known for exposing vices and provoking thought. Eulenspiegel is said to have lived in Braunschweig (&quot;Brunswick&quot;), but his last year of life he allegedly resided in Mölln. He died from the plague in 1350. Although his existence is not proven, there are several monuments to him in Mölln.

In 1992, right-wing extremists set fire to Turkish-inhabited houses, killing three girls.

<text>Gay bashing is an attack, abuse, or assault committed against a person who is perceived by the aggressor to be gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or queer (LGBTQ+). It includes both violence against LGBTQ people and LGBTQ bullying. The term covers violence against and bullying of people who are LGBTQ, as well as non-LGBTQ people whom the attacker perceives to be LGBTQ. 

Physical gay bashings sometimes involve extreme violence or murder; the perpetrators’s actions being based on their perceptions or assumptions of the victim&#x27;s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

LGBTQ youth are more likely to report bullying than non-LGBTQ youth, particularly in schools. Victims of LGBTQ bullying may feel unsafe, resulting in depression and anxiety, including increased rates of suicide and attempted suicide. LGBTQ students may try to pass as heterosexual to escape the bullying, leading to further stress and isolation from available supports. Support organizations exist in many countries to prevent LGBTQ bullying and support victims. Some jurisdictions have passed legislation against LGBTQ bullying and harassment.

== Violence ==

LGBTQ people frequently experience violence directed toward their sexuality, gender identity, or gender expression. This violence may be enacted by the state, as in laws prescribing punishment for homosexual acts, or by individuals. It may be motivated by biphobia, gayphobia, homophobia, lesbophobia, and transphobia. Influencing factors may be cultural, religious, or political mores and biases.

== Bullying ==

Bullying of LGBTQ people, particularly LGBTQ youth, involves intentional actions toward the victim, repeated negative actions by one or more people against another person, and an imbalance of physical or psychological power.

LGBTQ youth are more likely to report bullying than non-LGBTQ youth. In one study, boys who were bullied with taunts of being gay suffered more bullying and more negative effects compared with boys who were bullied with other categories of taunting. Some researchers suggest including youth questioning their sexuality in any research on LGBTQ bullying because they may be as susceptible to its effects as LGBTQ students.

<text>The digit ratio is the ratio taken of the lengths of different digits or fingers on a hand.

The most commonly studied digit ratio is that of the 2nd (index finger) and 4th (ring finger), also referred to as the 2D:4D ratio, measured on the palm side. It is proposed that the 2D:4D ratio indicates the degree to which an individual has been exposed to androgens during key stages of fetal development. A lower ratio has been associated with higher androgen exposure, which would be the physiological norm for males but may also occur in some exceptional circumstances in females. The latter include developmental disorders such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia. 

The 2D:4D ratio has been postulated to correlate with a range of physical and cognitive traits in childhood and adulthood, including personality traits such as assertiveness in women, aggressiveness in men, and cognitive abilities such as numerical skills. It has also been shown to vary considerably between racial groups with males having, on average, lower 2D:4D ratio than females.

Studies in this field have drawn criticism over questionable statistical significance and difficulties in reproducing their findings as well as lack of high quality research protocols.

==Measurement==
The 2D:4D ratio is calculated by dividing the length of the index finger by the length of the ring finger of the same hand. Other digit ratios are also calculated similarly in the same hand.

The digit length is typically measured on the palmar (ventral, &quot;palm-side&quot;) hand, from the midpoint of the bottom crease to the tip of the finger. Measurement of the digits on the dorsal (&quot;back-side&quot;) hand, from the tip of the finger to the proximal phalange-bone protrusion (which occurs when digits are bent at 90 degrees to the palm) has also recently gained acceptance. A study has shown that, compared to the palmar digit ratio, the dorsal digit ratio is a better indicator of bone digit ratio. Furthermore, the palmar digit ratio is affected by the differential positioning of flexion creases.

It has been alleged that, because academics have accepted a variety of techniques and equipment (such as calipers, radiography and photocopy), researchers record multiple measurements and report only those which have significant findings, a form of reporting bias.

==History of research==
Various reports in the scientific literature of the late 1800s noted that a greater proportion of men have shorter index fingers than ring fingers as compared to women. By 1930, statistically significant sex differences in digit ratio were established in a sample of 201 men and 109 women, after which time the sex difference appears to have been largely forgotten or ignored.

In 1983, Glenn Wilson of King&#x27;s College London published a study examining the correlation between assertiveness in women and their digit ratio, which found that women with a lower 2D:4D ratio reported greater assertiveness. This was the first study to examine the correlation between digit ratio and a psychological trait within members of the same sex. Wilson proposed that skeletal structure and personality were simultaneously affected by sex hormone levels in utero.

In 1998, John T. Manning and colleagues reported the sex difference in digit ratios was present in two-year-old children and further developed the idea that the index was a marker of prenatal sex hormones. Since then, research on the topic has burgeoned around the world.

2D:4D digit ratios have been used alongside other methods in an attempt to understand Palaeolithic hand stencils found in prehistoric European and Indonesian cave painting.

==Sexual dimorphism and age==
Studies measuring the 2D:4D of fetuses have found the ratio to be sexually dimorphic, being lower in males than females.

However, when examining the extent of sexual dimorphism evident after birth, adults were found to demonstrate more dimorphism than children, who show the same extent of dimorphism as fetuses. This has led the authors to suggest that digit ratio is also affected by postnatal development. Similarly, a study of people from Poland found statistically significant variation in 2D:4D between age groups (children, young adults and adults) for both males and females in the left hand, but only for women with the right hand.

Sexual dimorphism is strongest in digit ratios involving digit 2 with palmar measurements. However, when measured dorsally, digit ratios involving digit 5 showed strongest dimorphism, with women having shorter fifth digits on average. Overall, dorsal digit ratios demonstrate stronger sexual dimorphism than palmar digit ratios, including the palmar 2D:4D ratio that has been the basis of most study. Moreover, compared to palmar digit ratio, dorsal digit ratio is a better indicator of bone digit ratio. Thus, while most of the earlier research has focused on palmar 2D:4D ratio, study of other digit ratios is also promising.

A 2009 study in &quot;Biology Letters&quot; argues: &quot;Sexual differences in 2D:4D are mainly caused by the shift along the common allometric line with non-zero intercept, which means 2D:4D necessarily decreases with increasing finger length, and the fact that men have longer fingers than women&quot;, which the authors claim may be the basis for the sex differences in 2D:4D and/or any putative hormonal influence on the ratios.

There has been no reliable correlation reported between 2D:4D and sex hormone levels in adulthood. Marta Kowal has suggested that testosterone levels are correlated with other factors (such as smoking, body weight and diet) that would impact the relationship between 2D:4D and an adult&#x27;s testosterone level.

==Effect of prenatal hormones==
It has been proposed that 2D:4D ratio is affected by fetal exposure to sex hormones, in particular to testosterone and other androgens. Lower 2D:4D is found to correlate with higher prenatal androgen exposure. Therefore digit ratio could be considered a proxy variable (indirect measure) for prenatal androgen exposure. Various studies suggest that 2D:4D is also influenced by prenatal estrogen exposure, and that it correlates negatively, not with prenatal testosterone alone, but with the testosterone-to-estrogen ratio.

Prenatal hormone exposure can be measured via amniocentesis (usually performed between 14th and 20th weeks of pregnancy), maternal serum sampling and umbilical cord sampling at birth, the latter being a measure of exposure in late gestation. A 2024 meta-analysis has suggested that digit ratio may be related to amniotic fluid testosterone levels, but not umbilical cord levels, requiring further validation. 

A 2011 paper by Zhengui Zheng and Martin J. Cohn reports that &quot;the 2D:4D ratio in mice is controlled by the balance of androgen to estrogen signaling during a narrow window of digit development&quot;. The formation of the digits in humans, in utero, is thought to occur by 13 weeks, and the bone-to-bone ratio is consistent from this point into an individual&#x27;s adulthood. If, during this period, the fetus is exposed to androgens (levels of which are usually far higher in male than female fetuses) the growth rate of the 4th digit is increased. In a 2006 study, digit ratio analysis of opposite-sex dizygotic twins found that the females in these pairings were born with significantly lower 2D:4D ratio, postulated to occur from exposure to excess androgens from their brothers in utero (the hormone-transfer theory). However, an attempt to replicate these findings with a larger sample of dizygotic twins (867 individuals) found no differences in the variance or co-variance of same-sex and opposite-sex pairings to support the theory, though it did confirm female 2D:4D to be significantly higher than male as expected.

Researchers have raised concerns that, although the general trend points towards a correlation between digit ratio and early androgen exposure, many results have not been statistically significant.

Various findings have also challenged the general trend. One study of 66 children that attempted to replicate the findings of a frequently cited paper on the topic found no association between prenatal testosterone and estrogen levels and 2D:4D in childhood. Another paper also found no relationship between 2D:4D ratios and umbilical cord androgen and estrogen levels. A large meta-analysis studying genomic correlations was unable to find evidence for 2D:4D being a marker for prenatal androgen exposure, but did not exclude the possibility given constraints in genomic knowledge (with 3.8% of the variance in 2D:4D ratio accounted for genetically).

===Developmental disorders===
Women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), who have elevated androgen levels before birth, have lower (more masculine) 2D:4D on average along with other possible physiological effects such as an enlarged clitoris and shallow vagina. Males with CAH also express lower digit ratios than controls. Amniocentesis samples in males with CAH show that prenatal levels of testosterone are in the high-normal range and levels of the weaker androgen androstenedione are several fold higher than in controls, indicating that males with CAH are exposed to greater prenatal concentrations of total androgens.

A greater (more feminine) digit ratio occurs for men with Klinefelter&#x27;s syndrome, who have reduced testosterone secretion throughout life compared to their fathers or to controls.

Digit ratio in men may correlate with genetic variation in the androgen receptor gene. Men with genes that produce androgen receptors that are less sensitive to testosterone (because they have more CAG repeats) have greater digit ratios, though there have also been reports of failure in replicating this finding. Men with less sensitive androgen receptors may compensate for this by secreting more testosterone via reduced inhibitory feedback on gonadotropins. Thus, it is not clear that 2D:4D would be expected to correlate with CAG repeats, even if it accurately reflects prenatal androgen.

XY individuals with androgen insensitivity syndrome due to a dysfunctional gene for the androgen receptor present as women and have greater digit ratios on average, as would be predicted if androgenic hormones affect digit ratios. This finding suggests that the sex difference in digit ratios may be unrelated to the Y chromosome per se.

==Geographic and ethnic variation==
Several studies have presented evidence that digit ratios are heritable.

Manning and colleagues have reported that 2D:4D ratios vary greatly between different ethnic groups. In a study of Han, Berber, Uygur and Jamaican children, Manning &quot;et al.&quot; found that Han children had the highest mean values of 2D:4D (0.954±0.032). They were followed by the Berbers (0.950±0.033), then the Uygurs (0.946±0.037) and the Jamaican children had the lowest mean 2D:4D (0.935±0.035). This variation is far larger than the differences between sexes; in Manning&#x27;s words, &quot;There&#x27;s more difference between a Pole and a Finn, than a man and a woman.&quot;

In 2007, Manning &quot;et al.&quot; reported further evidence of ethnic variation in mean 2D:4D, with higher ratios for Whites, non-Chinese Asians and Middle-Easterners, and lower ratios in Chinese and Black samples. A 2008 study by Lu &quot;et al.&quot; found that the mean values of 2D:4D of the Hui and the Han in Ningxia were lower than those in European countries like Britain.

Two studies explored the question of whether geographical differences in 2D:4D ratios were caused by gene pool differences or whether some environmental variable associated with latitude might be involved (e.g., exposure to sunlight or different day-length patterns). The conclusions were that geographical differences in 2D:4D ratio were caused by genetic pool differences, not by geographical latitude.

Consanguineous parentage (inbreeding) has been found to lower the 2D:4D ratio in offspring, which may account for some of the geographical and ethnic variation in 2D:4D ratios, as consanguinity rates depend on, among others, religion, culture, and geography.

==Cognitive and physical traits==
The 2D:4D ratio has been associated with a variety of traits including academic ability, personality as well as physical attributes such as health outcomes. Lower (masculinized) 2D:4D ratios have been associated with higher mathematical ability as well as personality traits such as aggressiveness (in males), assertiveness (in females) and reduced agreeableness. Males with higher (feminized) ratios are reported to be more at risk of low sperm counts, heart disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome and depression than those with lower ratios. Females with higher ratios are more at risk of eating disorders, anxiety and depression.

Prenatal androgen exposure has been implicated as a determinant in left-handedness, though contradictory and inconclusive findings have been reported concerning an association between 2D:4D and left-hand dominance. Kumar &quot;et al.&quot; have reported that hand preference is most strongly associated with 3D:4D digit ratios and that the effect is reversed between children and adults.

Fink &quot;et al.&quot; (2004) found that men with low 2D:4D ratios (indicating high testosterone) and women with high 2D:4D ratios (indicating high estrogen) express greater levels of facial symmetry. The prenatal sex hormone ratio (indicated by 2D:4D) was associated with similar alterations to both male and female face shapes in utero, though the effect was three times more pronounced in males than in females.

In a non-clinical sample of women, digit ratio correlated with anogenital distance in the expected direction. In other words, women with a greater anogenital distance, indicating greater prenatal androgen exposure, had a smaller digit ratio. Ronalds &quot;et al.&quot; (2002) showed that men who had an above average placental weight and a shorter neonatal crown-heel length had higher 2D:4D ratios in adult life.

In 2020, a paper by John T Manning and Bernhard Fink reported that at the national level, high mean male 2D:4D was associated with high case fatality rates with COVID-19, and suggested that this may be used to &quot;identify for whom it would be advisable to exercise social distancing.&quot; Subsequent researchers failed to replicate their findings, and criticised Manning and Fink for publishing papers that fail under scrutiny despite the urgent need for high quality science during the pandemic that informs medical decisions.

==Explanation of the digit ratio effect==
The mechanisms by which prenatal hormones influence digit ratio are not clearly understood. Traits such as otoacoustic emissions and arm-to-trunk length ratio are also influenced by prenatal hormones, and it is postulated that Hox genes responsible for both digit and penis development play an important role in affecting these multiple traits (pleiotropy). Direct effects of sex hormones on bone growth might be responsible, either by regulation of Hox genes in digit development or independently of such genes.

Though it is unclear why the digit ratio on the right hand should be more sensitive to prenatal hormones than that on the left hand, as indicated by the greater sex difference on the right than the left, these differences are not evident in dorsal measurements nor bone digit ratios, and it is possible that right-left differences in palmar 2D:4D may be attributed to differential placing of flexion creases.

==Criticism==
The credibility of research into the relationship between digit ratios and traits has been subject to criticism for various reasons.

# Weaknesses in the statistical significance of numerous findings.
# Irreproducibility of findings in many instances, with some studies reporting contradictory results.
# Lack of a clear cause-and-effect relationship between digit ratio and traits.

Concerning the evidence for causal relationships, the reliability of digit ratio as a proxy variable has come under scrutiny. Some studies that investigate the relationship between a trait and an unobservable variable fail to consider possible confounding variables. This is especially problematic in cases where the relationship is likely to be weak, such as with prenatal testosterone. Furthermore, critics have pointed out that controlling for confounding variables is an impossible task due to the expanding list of confounding variables, including ethnicity, sex, and physical, medical or behavioral conditions.

A 2021 paper by James Smoliga, titled &quot;Giving science the finger—is the second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) a biomarker of good luck? A cross sectional study&quot; followed similar research methodologies adopted by others in the field and came to conclude that low digit ratio is associated with good luck. This result is attributed to chance and presented as an illustration of the reproducibility crisis. Smoliga would later go on to label the field as pseudoscience. In a response, John T. Manning criticized the researchers for not controlling for ethnicity.

Researcher Marta Kowal states: &quot;One of the general limitations of studies on the digit ratios is the high number of degrees of freedom within the 2D:4D (the right, left, and right minus left 2D:4D). Running many analyses with different predictors increases the chances of finding allegedly significant results.&quot;

* Alžbeta Talarovičová and collaborators found in rats that elevated testosterone during the prenatal period can influence 4D length, the 2D:4D ratio, and open field motor activity.
* Peter L. Hurd, Theodore Garland Jr., and their students have examined hindlimb 2D:4D in lines of mice selectively bred for high voluntary wheel-running behavior (see experimental evolution). These high-runner mice exhibit increased 2D:4D in contradiction to the correlation between digit ratio and physical fitness in human beings, suggesting that 2D:4D may not be a clear proxy for prenatal androgen exposure in mice. The authors suggest that 2D:4D may more accurately reflect the effect of glucocorticoids or other factors that regulate any of various genes.
* In pheasants, the ratio of the 2nd to 4th digit of the foot has been shown to be influenced by manipulations of testosterone in the egg.
* Studies in mice indicate that prenatal androgen influences 2D:4D primarily by promoting growth of the fourth digit.

<text>Brandon Teena (December 12, 1972 – December 31, 1993) was an American transgender man who was raped and later, along with Phillip DeVine and Lisa Lambert, murdered in Humboldt, Nebraska, by John Lotter and Tom Nissen. His life and death are the subject of the films &quot;The Brandon Teena Story&quot; and &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;. Teena&#x27;s murder, along with that of Matthew Shepard nearly five years later, led to increased lobbying for hate crime laws in the United States.

==Life==
Teena was born on December 12, 1972, in Lincoln, Nebraska, to JoAnn Brandon. His father died in a car accident in Lancaster County eight months before he was born, and he was raised by his mother. Teena and his older sister Tammy lived with their maternal grandmother in Lincoln, before they were reclaimed by their mother when Teena was three years old and Tammy was six. The family resided in the Pine Acre Mobile Home Park in northeast Lincoln. JoAnn received disability checks and worked as a clerk in a women&#x27;s retail store in Lincoln to support the family. As young children, Teena and Tammy were sexually abused by their uncle for several years, and Teena sought counseling for this in 1991. JoAnn remarried in 1975, divorcing in 1980. Teena&#x27;s family described him as being a tomboy since early childhood; Teena began identifying as male during adolescence and dated a female student during this period. His mother rejected his male identity and continued referring to him as her daughter. On several occasions, Teena claimed to be intersex.

Teena and his sister attended St. Mary&#x27;s Elementary School and Pius X High School in Lincoln, where some remembered Teena as being socially awkward. During his second year, Teena rejected Christianity after he protested to a priest at Pius X regarding Christian views on abstinence and homosexuality. He also began rebelling at school by violating the school dress-code policy to dress in a more masculine fashion. During the first semester of his senior year, a U.S. Army recruiter visited the high school, encouraging students to enlist in the armed forces. Teena enlisted in the United States Army shortly after his eighteenth birthday and hoped to serve a tour of duty in Operation Desert Shield. However, he failed the written entrance exam by listing his sex as male.

In December 1990, Teena went to Holiday Skate Park with his friends, binding his chest to pass as male. In the months nearing his high school graduation, Teena became unusually outgoing and was remembered by classmates as a &quot;class clown.&quot; Teena also began skipping school and receiving failing grades. He was expelled from Pius X High School in June 1991, three days before graduation.

In mid-1991, Teena began his first serious relationship, with a girl named Heather. Shortly after, Teena secured employment as a gas station attendant in an attempt to secure funds to purchase a trailer home for himself and his girlfriend. However, his mother disapproved of the relationship and convinced her daughter Tammy to follow Teena to determine whether Teena&#x27;s relationship with Heather was platonic or sexual.

In January 1992, Teena underwent a psychiatric evaluation, which concluded that Teena had a severe &quot;sexual identity crisis&quot;. He was later taken to the Lancaster County Crisis Center to ensure that he was not suicidal. He was released from the center three days later and began attending therapy sessions, sometimes accompanied by his mother or sister. He was reluctant to discuss his sexuality during these sessions but revealed that he had been raped. The sessions ended after two weeks.

In 1993, after some legal trouble, Teena moved to the Falls City region of Richardson County, Nebraska, where he presented as a man. He became friends with several residents. After moving into the home of Lisa Lambert, Teena began dating Lambert&#x27;s friend, 19-year-old Lana Tisdel, and began associating with ex-convicts John L. Lotter (born May 31, 1971) and Marvin Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Nissen (born October 22, 1971).

On December 19, 1993, Teena was arrested for forging checks; Tisdel used money from her father to pay Teena&#x27;s bail. Because Teena was in the female section of the jail, Tisdel learned that he was transgender. When Tisdel later questioned Teena about his gender, he told her he was a hermaphrodite pursuing a sex change operation, and they continued dating. In a lawsuit regarding the film adaptation &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, this was disputed by Tisdel. Teena&#x27;s arrest was posted in the local paper under his birth name and thereupon his acquaintances learned that he was assigned female at birth.

==Rape and murder==
During a Christmas Eve party, Nissen and Lotter grabbed Teena and forced him to remove his pants, proving to Tisdel that Teena had a vulva. Tisdel looked only when forced to and said nothing. Lotter and Nissen later assaulted Teena and forced him into a car. They drove to an area by a meat-packing plant in Richardson County, where they assaulted and gang-raped him. They then returned to Nissen&#x27;s home, where Teena was ordered to take a shower. Teena escaped from Nissen&#x27;s bathroom by climbing out the window and going to Tisdel&#x27;s house. He was convinced by Tisdel to file a police report, though Nissen and Lotter had warned Teena to &quot;keep her mouth shut or they&#x27;d permanently shut it for her.&quot; Teena also went to the emergency room, where a standard rape kit was assembled but later lost. Sheriff Charles B. Laux questioned Teena about the rape. Reportedly, he seemed especially interested in Teena&#x27;s transgender status, to the point that Teena found his questions rude and unnecessary and refused to answer. Nissen and Lotter were taken in for police questioning. Despite ample evidence, Laux neglected to arrest and charge Nissen and Lotter, and Laux told them both a rape had been reported. Laux declined to have them arrested because, &quot;What kind of a person was she? The first few times we arrested her, she was putting herself off as a guy.&quot; Teena&#x27;s mother later filed a wrongful death suit, where the Nebraska Supreme Court found Laux&#x27;s inaction resulted in Teena&#x27;s death (&quot;see for more information&quot;).

Around 1:00 a.m. on December 31, 1993, Nissen and Lotter drove to Lambert&#x27;s house and broke in. They found Lambert in bed and demanded to know where Teena was. Lambert refused to tell them. Nissen searched and found Teena hiding under a blanket at the foot of the bed. The men asked Lambert if there was anyone else in the house, and she replied that Phillip DeVine, who at the time was dating Tisdel&#x27;s sister, was staying with her. The duo then shot Teena in the stomach. Nissen testified in court that he had noticed that Teena was twitching, and asked Lotter for a knife, with which Nissen stabbed Teena in the chest, to ensure that he was dead. Nissen later testified that he shot Lambert in the stomach. After leaving the room to find DeVine, and then returning with him, Nissen shot Lambert a second time. The two men then took DeVine into the living room, sat him on the couch, and shot him twice. Nissen then returned to the bedroom where he shot Lambert a few more times. The two men then left, threw their weapons and gloves onto a frozen river, and returned to Falls City. They were arrested that afternoon, after which Nissen told deputies that he had witnessed John Lotter shoot three people to death in Humboldt. Police went to the river, where they retrieved the gloves and weapons, including the knife&#x27;s sheath marked with Lotter&#x27;s name, tying them to the crime.

Teena is buried in Lincoln Memorial Cemetery in Lincoln, Nebraska. His headstone is inscribed with his deadname and the epitaph &quot;daughter, sister, &amp; friend&quot;.

Nissen accused Lotter of committing the murders. In exchange for a reduced sentence, Nissen admitted to being an accessory to the rape and murder. Nissen testified against Lotter and was sentenced to life in prison. Lotter denied the veracity of Nissen&#x27;s testimony, and his testimony was discredited. The jury found Lotter guilty of murder and sentenced him to death. Lotter and Nissen both appealed their convictions. In September 2007, Nissen recanted his testimony against Lotter. He claimed that he was the only one to shoot Teena and that Lotter had not committed the murders. In 2009, Lotter&#x27;s appeal, using Nissen&#x27;s new testimony to assert a claim of innocence, was rejected by the Nebraska Supreme Court, which held that since—even under Nissen&#x27;s revised testimony—both Lotter and Nissen were involved in the murder, the specific identity of the shooter was legally irrelevant. In August 2011, a three-judge panel of the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected John Lotter&#x27;s appeal in a split decision. In October 2011, the Eighth Circuit rejected Lotter&#x27;s request for a rehearing by the panel or the full Eighth Circuit &quot;en banc&quot;. Lotter next petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States for a review of his case. The Supreme Court declined to review Lotter&#x27;s case, denying his petition for writ of certiorari on March 19, 2012, and a further petition for rehearing on April 23, 2012, leaving his conviction to stand. On January 22, 2018, Lotter was denied a third appeal by the U.S. Supreme Court.

==Cultural and legal legacy==
Because Teena had neither commenced hormone replacement therapy nor had gender confirmation surgery, he has sometimes mistakenly been identified as a lesbian by media reporters. However, some reported Teena&#x27;s plans to have sex reassignment surgery.

Following Lotter&#x27;s sentencing in February 1996, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; aired a segment in which comedian Norm Macdonald joked: The comments were met with sharp criticism from trans and queer communities and organizations including The Transexual Menace, who threatened to picket &quot;SNL&quot; in the absence of an apology. Upon reviewing the show, NBC agreed the line was inappropriate and should not have aired, and said it would ensure that similar incidents would not happen in the future.

JoAnn Brandon sued Richardson County and Sheriff Laux for failing to prevent Teena&#x27;s death and being an indirect cause. She won the case, which was heard in September 1999 in Falls City, and was awarded $80,000. District court judge Orville Coady reduced the amount by 85 percent based on the responsibility of Nissen and Lotter and by one percent for Brandon&#x27;s alleged contributory negligence. This led to a remaining judgment of responsibility against Richardson County and Laux of $17,360.97. In 2001, the Nebraska Supreme Court reversed the reductions of the earlier award reinstating the full $80,000 award for &quot;mental suffering&quot;, plus $6,223.20 for funeral costs. In October 2001, the same judge awarded the plaintiff an additional $12,000: $5,000 for wrongful death, and $7,000 for the intentional infliction of emotional distress. Laux was also criticized after the murder for his attitude toward Teena – at one point, Laux referred to Brandon as &quot;it.&quot; After the case was over, Laux served as commissioner of Richardson County and later as part of his community&#x27;s council before retiring as a school bus driver. He refused to speak about his actions in the case and called one reporter who contacted him for a story on the murder&#x27;s twentieth anniversary &quot;a pain in the ass.&quot;

In 1999, Teena became the subject of a biographical film entitled &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, directed by Kimberly Peirce and starring Hilary Swank as Teena and Chloë Sevigny as Tisdel. For their performances, Swank won, and Sevigny was nominated for an Academy Award. Tisdel sued the film&#x27;s producers for unauthorized use of her name and likeness before the film&#x27;s release. She claimed the film depicted her as &quot;lazy, white trash, and a skanky snake&quot;. Tisdel also claimed that the film falsely portrayed that she continued the relationship with Teena after discovering that he was transgender. She eventually settled her lawsuit against the movie&#x27;s distributor for an undisclosed sum.

JoAnn Brandon publicly objected to the media referring to her child as &quot;he&quot; and &quot;Brandon.&quot; Following Hilary Swank&#x27;s Oscar acceptance speech, JoAnn Brandon took offense at Swank for thanking &quot;Brandon Teena&quot; and referring to him as a man. &quot;That set me off,&quot; said JoAnn Brandon. &quot;She should not stand up there and thank my child. I get tired of people taking credit for what they don&#x27;t know.&quot; However, in 2013, JoAnn told a reporter that she accepted Teena being referred to as transgender in the media. Although she was unhappy with how &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; portrayed the situation, she said about the film, &quot;It gave them [gay and transgender advocates] a platform to voice their opinions, and I&#x27;m glad. There were a lot of people who didn&#x27;t understand what it was [Teena] was going through. We&#x27;ve come a long way.&quot; When asked how the murder affects her life today, JoAnn replied, &quot;I wonder how my life would be different if she was still with me. She would be such a joy to have around. She was always such a happy kid. I imagine her being a happy adult. And if being happy meant [Teena] living as a man, I would be fine with that.&quot;

&quot;Brandon&quot;, an interactive web artwork created in 1998 by Shu Lea Cheang, was named for Brandon Teena. The artwork was commissioned by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Much of the site&#x27;s content relates to Brandon&#x27;s story.

The British duo Pet Shop Boys released a song titled &quot;Girls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (a bonus track on UK issue of &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot;) about Teena in 2006. Vancouver-based pop-punk band Hotel Mira released the song &quot;Brandon&quot;, off their debut 2014 album &quot;Circulation&quot;, in memory of Brandon Teena.

In 2018, Donna Minkowitz, the journalist whose reporting on Teena&#x27;s murder first brought the story to a wider audience, wrote a piece for the &quot;Village Voice&quot; in which she expressed her regret for not understanding transgender people when she wrote her original report.

<doc id="102871" wikidata="Q912751" url="?curid=102871" title="Cellular respiration">
<text>Cellular respiration is the process of oxidizing biological fuels using an inorganic electron acceptor, such as oxygen, to drive production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which contains energy. Cellular respiration may be described as a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to transfer chemical energy from nutrients to ATP, and then release waste products.

Cellular respiration is a vital process that occurs in the cells of all plants and some bacteria
. Respiration can be either aerobic, requiring oxygen, or anaerobic; some organisms can switch between aerobic and anaerobic respiration.

The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, producing large amounts of energy (ATP). Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are redox reactions. Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it is an unusual one because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions.

Nutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar, amino acids and fatty acids, and the most common oxidizing agent is molecular oxygen (O2). The chemical energy stored in ATP (the bond of its third phosphate group to the rest of the molecule can be broken allowing more stable products to form, thereby releasing energy for use by the cell) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy, including biosynthesis, locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes.

== Aerobic respiration ==

Aerobic respiration requires oxygen (O2) in order to create ATP. Although carbohydrates, fats and proteins are consumed as reactants, aerobic respiration is the preferred method of pyruvate production in glycolysis, and requires pyruvate be transported the mitochondria in order to be oxidized by the citric acid cycle. The products of this process are carbon dioxide and water, and the energy transferred is used to make bonds between ADP and a third phosphate group to form ATP (adenosine triphosphate), by substrate-level phosphorylation, NADH and FADH2.
The negative ΔG indicates that the reaction is exothermic (exergonic) and can occur spontaneously.

The potential of NADH and FADH2 is converted to more ATP through an electron transport chain with oxygen and protons (hydrogen ions) as the &quot;terminal electron acceptors&quot;. Most of the ATP produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation. The energy released is used to create a chemiosmotic potential by pumping protons across a membrane. This potential is then used to drive ATP synthase and produce ATP from ADP and a phosphate group. Biology textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules can be made per oxidized glucose molecule during cellular respiration (2 from glycolysis, 2 from the Krebs cycle, and about 34 from the electron transport system). However, this maximum yield is never quite reached because of losses due to leaky membranes as well as the cost of moving pyruvate and ADP into the mitochondrial matrix, and current estimates range around 29 to 30 ATP per glucose.

Aerobic metabolism is up to 15 times more efficient than anaerobic metabolism (which yields 2 molecules of ATP per 1 molecule of glucose). However, some anaerobic organisms, such as methanogens are able to continue with anaerobic respiration, yielding more ATP by using inorganic molecules other than oxygen as final electron acceptors in the electron transport chain. They share the initial pathway of glycolysis but aerobic metabolism continues with the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. The post-glycolytic reactions take place in the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells, and in the cytoplasm in prokaryotic cells.

Although plants are net consumers of carbon dioxide and producers of oxygen via photosynthesis, plant respiration accounts for about half of the CO2 generated annually by terrestrial ecosystems.

===Glycolysis===
Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that takes place in the cytosol of cells in all living organisms. Glycolysis can be literally translated as &quot;sugar splitting&quot;, and occurs regardless of oxygen&#x27;s presence or absence. The process converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate (pyruvic acid), generating energy in the form of two net molecules of ATP. Four molecules of ATP per glucose are actually produced, but two are consumed as part of the preparatory phase. The initial phosphorylation of glucose is required to increase the reactivity (decrease its stability) in order for the molecule to be cleaved into two pyruvate molecules by the enzyme aldolase. During the pay-off phase of glycolysis, four phosphate groups are transferred to four ADP by substrate-level phosphorylation to make four ATP, and two NADH are also produced during the pay-off phase. The overall reaction can be expressed this way:

:Glucose + 2 NAD+ + 2 Pi + 2 ADP → 2 pyruvate + 2 NADH + 2 ATP + 2 H+ + 2 H2O + energy

Starting with glucose, 1 ATP is used to donate a phosphate to glucose to produce glucose 6-phosphate. Glycogen can be converted into glucose 6-phosphate as well with the help of glycogen phosphorylase. During energy metabolism, glucose 6-phosphate becomes fructose 6-phosphate. An additional ATP is used to phosphorylate fructose 6-phosphate into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate by the help of phosphofructokinase. Fructose 1,6-biphosphate then splits into two phosphorylated molecules with three carbon chains which later degrades into pyruvate.

===Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate===

Pyruvate is oxidized to acetyl-CoA and CO2 by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). The PDC contains multiple copies of three enzymes and is located in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and in the cytosol of prokaryotes. In the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, one molecule of NADH and one molecule of CO2 is formed.

===Citric acid cycle===

The citric acid cycle is also called the &quot;Krebs cycle&quot; or the &quot;tricarboxylic acid cycle&quot;. When oxygen is present, acetyl-CoA is produced from the pyruvate molecules created from glycolysis. Once acetyl-CoA is formed, aerobic or anaerobic respiration can occur. When oxygen is present, the mitochondria will undergo aerobic respiration which leads to the Krebs cycle. However, if oxygen is not present, fermentation of the pyruvate molecule will occur. In the presence of oxygen, when acetyl-CoA is produced, the molecule then enters the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) inside the mitochondrial matrix, and is oxidized to CO2 while at the same time reducing NAD to NADH. NADH can be used by the electron transport chain to create further ATP as part of oxidative phosphorylation. To fully oxidize the equivalent of one glucose molecule, two acetyl-CoA must be metabolized by the Krebs cycle. Two low-energy waste products, H2O and CO2, are created during this cycle.

The citric acid cycle is an 8-step process involving 18 different enzymes and co-enzymes. During the cycle, acetyl-CoA (2 carbons) + oxaloacetate (4 carbons) yields citrate (6 carbons), which is rearranged to a more reactive form called isocitrate (6 carbons). Isocitrate is modified to become α-ketoglutarate (5 carbons), succinyl-CoA, succinate, fumarate, malate and, finally, oxaloacetate.

The net gain from one cycle is 3 NADH and 1 FADH2 as hydrogen (proton plus electron) carrying compounds and 1 high-energy GTP, which may subsequently be used to produce ATP. Thus, the total yield from 1 glucose molecule (2 pyruvate molecules) is 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, and 2 ATP.

===Oxidative phosphorylation===

In eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the mitochondrial cristae. It comprises the electron transport chain that establishes a proton gradient (chemiosmotic potential) across the boundary of the inner membrane by oxidizing the NADH produced from the Krebs cycle. ATP is synthesized by the ATP synthase enzyme when the chemiosmotic gradient is used to drive the phosphorylation of ADP. The electrons are finally transferred to exogenous oxygen and, with the addition of two protons, water is formed.

==Efficiency of ATP production==
The table below describes the reactions involved when one glucose molecule is fully oxidized into carbon dioxide. It is assumed that all the reduced coenzymes are oxidized by the electron transport chain and used for oxidative phosphorylation.

Although there is a theoretical yield of 38 ATP molecules per glucose during cellular respiration, such conditions are generally not realized because of losses such as the cost of moving pyruvate (from glycolysis), phosphate, and ADP (substrates for ATP synthesis) into the mitochondria. All are actively transported using carriers that utilize the stored energy in the proton electrochemical gradient.
* Pyruvate is taken up by a specific, low &quot;K&quot;m transporter to bring it into the mitochondrial matrix for oxidation by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
* The phosphate carrier (PiC) mediates the electroneutral exchange (antiport) of phosphate (; Pi) for OH− or symport of phosphate and protons (H+) across the inner membrane, and the driving force for moving phosphate ions into the mitochondria is the proton motive force.
* The ATP-ADP translocase (also called adenine nucleotide translocase, ANT) is an antiporter and exchanges ADP and ATP across the inner membrane. The driving force is due to the ATP (−4) having a more negative charge than the ADP (−3), and thus it dissipates some of the electrical component of the proton electrochemical gradient.

The outcome of these transport processes using the proton electrochemical gradient is that more than 3 H+ are needed to make 1 ATP. Obviously, this reduces the theoretical efficiency of the whole process and the likely maximum is closer to 28–30 ATP molecules. In practice the efficiency may be even lower because the inner membrane of the mitochondria is slightly leaky to protons. Other factors may also dissipate the proton gradient creating an apparently leaky mitochondria. An uncoupling protein known as thermogenin is expressed in some cell types and is a channel that can transport protons. When this protein is active in the inner membrane it short circuits the coupling between the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis. The potential energy from the proton gradient is not used to make ATP but generates heat. This is particularly important in brown fat thermogenesis of newborn and hibernating mammals.
According to some newer sources, the ATP yield during aerobic respiration is not 36–38, but only about 30–32 ATP molecules / 1 molecule of glucose , because:
* ATP : NADH+H+ and ATP : FADH2 ratios during the oxidative phosphorylation appear to be not 3 and 2, but 2.5 and 1.5 respectively. Unlike in the substrate-level phosphorylation, the stoichiometry here is difficult to establish.
** ATP synthase produces 1 ATP / 3 H+. However the exchange of matrix ATP for cytosolic ADP and Pi (antiport with OH− or symport with H+) mediated by ATP–ADP translocase and phosphate carrier consumes 1 H+ / 1 ATP as a result of regeneration of the transmembrane potential changed during this transfer, so the net ratio is 1 ATP : 4 H+.
** The mitochondrial electron transport chain proton pump transfers across the inner membrane 10 H+ / 1 NADH+H+ (4 + 2 + 4) or 6 H+ / 1 FADH2 (2 + 4).
:So the final stoichiometry is
:1 NADH+H+ : 10 H+ : 10/4 ATP = 1 NADH+H+ : 2.5 ATP
:1 FADH2 : 6 H+ : 6/4 ATP = 1 FADH2 : 1.5 ATP
* ATP : NADH+H+ coming from glycolysis ratio during the oxidative phosphorylation is
** 1.5, as for FADH2, if hydrogen atoms (2H++2e−) are transferred from cytosolic NADH+H+ to mitochondrial FAD by the glycerol phosphate shuttle located in the inner mitochondrial membrane.
** 2.5 in case of malate-aspartate shuttle transferring hydrogen atoms from cytosolic NADH+H+ to mitochondrial NAD+

So finally we have, per molecule of glucose
* Substrate-level phosphorylation: 2 ATP from glycolysis + 2 ATP (directly GTP) from Krebs cycle
* Oxidative phosphorylation
** 2 NADH+H+ from glycolysis: 2 × 1.5 ATP (if glycerol phosphate shuttle transfers hydrogen atoms) or 2 × 2.5 ATP (malate-aspartate shuttle)
** 2 NADH+H+ from the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and 6 from Krebs cycle: 8 × 2.5 ATP
** 2 FADH2 from the Krebs cycle: 2 × 1.5 ATP
Altogether this gives 4 + 3 (or 5) + 20 + 3 = 30 (or 32) ATP per molecule of glucose

These figures may still require further tweaking as new structural details become available. The above value of 3 H+ / ATP for the synthase assumes that the synthase translocates 9 protons, and produces 3 ATP, per rotation. The number of protons depends on the number of c subunits in the Fo c-ring, and it is now known that this is 10 in yeast Fo and 8 for vertebrates. Including one H+ for the transport reactions, this means that synthesis of one ATP requires protons in yeast and in vertebrates. This would imply that in human mitochondria the 10 protons from oxidizing NADH would produce 2.72 ATP (instead of 2.5) and the 6 protons from oxidizing succinate or ubiquinol would produce 1.64 ATP (instead of 1.5). This is consistent with experimental results within the margin of error described in a recent review.

The total ATP yield in ethanol or lactic acid fermentation is only 2 molecules coming from glycolysis, because pyruvate is not transferred to the mitochondrion and finally oxidized to the carbon dioxide (CO2), but reduced to ethanol or lactic acid in the cytoplasm.

==Fermentation==

Without oxygen, pyruvate (pyruvic acid) is not metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of fermentation. The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion but remains in the cytoplasm, where it is converted to waste products that may be removed from the cell. This serves the purpose of oxidizing the electron carriers so that they can perform glycolysis again and removing the excess pyruvate. Fermentation oxidizes NADH to NAD+ so it can be re-used in glycolysis. In the absence of oxygen, fermentation prevents the buildup of NADH in the cytoplasm and provides NAD+ for glycolysis. This waste product varies depending on the organism. In skeletal muscles, the waste product is lactic acid. This type of fermentation is called lactic acid fermentation. In strenuous exercise, when energy demands exceed energy supply, the respiratory chain cannot process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by NADH. During anaerobic glycolysis, NAD+ regenerates when pairs of hydrogen combine with pyruvate to form lactate. Lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction. Lactate can also be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen. During recovery, when oxygen becomes available, NAD+ attaches to hydrogen from lactate to form ATP. In yeast, the waste products are ethanol and carbon dioxide. This type of fermentation is known as alcoholic or ethanol fermentation. The ATP generated in this process is made by substrate-level phosphorylation, which does not require oxygen.

Fermentation is less efficient at using the energy from glucose: only 2 ATP are produced per glucose, compared to the 38 ATP per glucose nominally produced by aerobic respiration. Glycolytic ATP, however, is produced more quickly. For prokaryotes to continue a rapid growth rate when they are shifted from an aerobic environment to an anaerobic environment, they must increase the rate of the glycolytic reactions. For multicellular organisms, during short bursts of strenuous activity, muscle cells use fermentation to supplement the ATP production from the slower aerobic respiration, so fermentation may be used by a cell even before the oxygen levels are depleted, as is the case in sports that do not require athletes to pace themselves, such as sprinting.

==Anaerobic respiration==

Cellular respiration is the process by which biological fuels are oxidised in the presence of an inorganic electron acceptor, such as oxygen, to produce large amounts of energy and drive the bulk production of ATP.

Anaerobic respiration is used by microorganisms, either bacteria or archaea, in which neither oxygen (aerobic respiration) nor pyruvate derivatives (fermentation) is the final electron acceptor. Rather, an inorganic acceptor such as sulfate (), nitrate (), or sulfur (S) is used. Such organisms could be found in unusual places such as underwater caves or near hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean., as well as in anoxic soils or sediment in wetland ecosystems.

In July 2019, a scientific study of Kidd Mine in Canada discovered sulfur-breathing organisms which live below the surface. These organisms are also remarkable because they consume minerals such as pyrite as their food source.

<text>Incus Records is a British record company and label founded by Derek Bailey, Tony Oxley, Evan Parker and Michael Walters that specializes in free jazz and improvised music.

The first release on the label was Incus Number 0 (zero), a 7 “ record with AMM LIVE, after that came Incus Number 1, &quot;The Topography of the Lungs&quot;, recorded by Bailey, Parker, and percussionist Han Bennink in 1970. Walters and Oxley left the label shortly after its founding, after which it continued as a partnership between Bailey and Parker until a falling-out between the two men in the mid-1980s. Parker left in 1987. Bailey continued the label with Karen Brookman until his death in 2005. Its first CD release was &quot;CYRO&quot;, a duo recording of Bailey and percussionist Cyro Baptista. In later years the label has issued videos and limited-edition CDRs intended largely for friends and faithful collectors. It relaunched with a new website and a full catalogue in early 2009.

Aside from recordings by Bailey and Parker (who also produced), the Incus catalogue includes the work of Barry Guy, Howard Riley, Kenny Wheeler, Steve Lacy, and John Zorn.

At various times since 1985, Incus Records sponsored festivals of improvised music in London.

<doc id="102880" wikidata="Q5437603" url="?curid=102880" title="Father Guido Sarducci">
<text>Father Guido Sarducci is a fictional character created by American comedian Don Novello. Sarducci is a chain-smoking priest with tinted glasses, who works in the United States as gossip columnist and rock critic for the Vatican newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; (sometimes mentioned as &quot;The Vatican Enquirer&quot;, a take-off of the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; tabloid).

== Description ==
Novello created the character in 1973, after he purchased the outfit (consisting of big floppy black hat, white clerical collar, and a long, red-trimmed black coat with cape) for $7.50 at a St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Store. The character was featured in 1970s cartoons by the underground cartoonists Dave Sheridan and Fred Schrier, appearing in person in the early 1970s on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; and later in the 1975 &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;. His most prominent appearances were on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the late 1970s, during which time Novello was also a writer for the show. In the late 1970s, Father Guido Sarducci was featured on radio commercials for &quot;High Times&quot; magazine, where he offered to perform blessings for a fee.

== Broadcast history ==
On his first appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, a sketch called &quot;How to Pay for Your Sins&quot; on a 1978 episode hosted by Richard Dreyfuss, he was on crutches from an injury suffered during a dress rehearsal sketch about hockey players. Most of his appearances on &quot;SNL&quot; have been on &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, including one where he reported that &quot;The take at the shrines in Italy has gone down&quot;, which he suggested correcting by creating &quot;Shrinemobiles&quot; and thus taking the shrines to where the people were, and another where he is sent to London to try to wake up Paul McCartney at 4:30 in the morning (11:30 in New York) by throwing coins, obnoxiously singing The Beatles and Wings songs, and finally, throwing a rock at the window—he says it works every time.

=== &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; ===
Sarducci appeared in four cold opens in the 1979–1980 season (on episodes hosted by Steve Martin, Teri Garr, Elliott Gould, and Rodney Dangerfield), two commercial parodies (&quot;MX-5 Tampons&quot; on the 1981–1982 Christmas episode hosted by Bill Murray and &quot;Bocce Ball My Way&quot; on the last episode of the 1985–1986 season hosted by Anjelica Huston and Billy Martin), and two monologues on the 1985–86 season (the first hosted by Madonna in a pretaped sketch showing Madonna&#x27;s wedding to Sean Penn (played by Robert Downey, Jr.) and the second on the Christmas episode of the 1985–86 season hosted by Garr as Sarducci&#x27;s alter ego, Pope Maurice).

Sarducci also hosted two &quot;SNL&quot; episodes during the 1983–1984 season (when Dick Ebersol was executive producer) and cameoed during two 1990s episodes, most notably on a &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment where he reports on Pope John Paul II&#x27;s missing wallet. Father Guido Sarducci has 31 appearances on &quot;SNL&quot;, the most of any of the recurring characters.

=== Vatican visit ===
In 1981 Novello made newspaper headlines when he visited Vatican City wearing the Father Guido Sarducci costume to do a photo shoot for &quot;Time&quot; magazine. After taking pictures in an area where photography was prohibited, he and his photographer, Paul Solomon, were arrested by the Papal Swiss Guards and Novello was charged with &quot;impersonating a priest&quot;. Although the guards attempted to confiscate the film from the shoot, Solomon managed to hand them the wrong film. The charges were later dropped. In the early 1980s, Novello was featured in advertisements promoting candidates for the priesthood. He listed one advantage of being a priest as getting first pick at the annual parish garage sale.

=== Other media appearances ===
During the 1980s and 1990s Sarducci appeared on other television shows, including &quot;Fridays&quot;, &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Unhappily Ever After&quot;, &quot;Blossom&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;, the &quot;Tales of the City&quot; miniseries, and &quot;Square Pegs&quot;. In 1980, Sarducci appeared in &quot;Gilda Live&quot;, a film and an album recording based on Gilda Radner&#x27;s successful one-woman show that had been playing on Broadway. In 1983, he appeared in a music video for the Rodney Dangerfield song &quot;Rappin&#x27; Rodney&quot;, where he gave Rodney his last rites on death row, and helped himself to Rodney&#x27;s french fries from his last meal. In 1984, he appeared in a music video for the Jefferson Starship song &quot;No Way Out&quot;. In 1995, he appeared as a priest trying to perform an exorcism in the movie &quot;Casper&quot;. The same movie featured a cameo by his fellow &quot;SNL&quot; alumnus Dan Aykroyd as the Ghostbuster Ray Stantz.

=== Albums ===
He appeared on the 2002 album &quot;A Classic Rock Christmas&quot; performing the song &quot;Santa&#x27;s Lament&quot; featuring Joe Walsh and Joe Vitale.

The character also appeared on the Handsome Boy Modeling School albums &quot;So... How&#x27;s Your Girl?&quot; and &quot;White People&quot;, telling biographical stories of the life of a professional male model in the latter. Novello also released two comedy albums as Sarducci: &quot;Breakfast in Heaven&quot; and &quot;Live at St. Douglas Convent.&quot;

=== Additional appearances ===
He also appeared on the MSNBC show &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; on March 19, 2005, discussing &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; and his DaVinci Code Decoder Ring.

In the 2001 Disney animated film &quot;&quot;, Novello uses the voice and speech style of Father Sarducci to portray the character of demolitions expert Vinny Santorini.

Sarducci was present at the First Annual &quot;Geno Roast&quot; at the Aqua Turf in Southington, Connecticut. He gave the prayer of invocation and roasted the UConn Huskies women&#x27;s basketball coach Geno Auriemma. He also made a guest appearance on the April 30, 2005, broadcast of NPR and Chicago Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; news quiz show, commenting on the ascension of Pope Benedict XVI.

He appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on June 23, 2010, claiming to have conducted an interview with Glenn Beck while visiting the Vatican.

=== Benediction ===
He delivered the benediction at the Stewart/Colbert Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear from the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on October 30, 2010. He was wearing his classic white clerical collar, a long red-trimmed black coat with cape, zebra vest/jacket and black beret.

<doc id="102882" wikidata="Q5139962" url="?curid=102882" title="Coddling">
<text>In cooking, to coddle food is to heat it in water kept just below the boiling point. In the past, recipes called for coddling fruit, but in recent times the term is usually only applied to coddled eggs. Coddling differs from poaching in that the coddled ingredient is not placed directly in hot water, but instead in a small dish placed in a hot water bath. The process is either done in a regular pan or pot filled with water, either on the stovetop or placed in the oven, or through the use of a special device such as an &quot;egg coddler&quot; (originally known as a &quot;pipkin&quot;). The oven technique is similar to the preparation of baked eggs, the difference being that the preparation of baked eggs does not have to employ a water bath.

The word &quot;coddle&quot; evolved from the name of a warm drink, &quot;caudle&quot;, and ultimately deriving from the Latin word for warm drink, &quot;calidium&quot;.
Comparing the coddling cooking technique to boiling when it comes to whole eggs, the process of coddling takes a longer time due to the use of a lower cooking temperature, but it produces a more tender egg.

<doc id="102883" wikidata="Q34394" url="?curid=102883" title="Belief">
<text>A belief is a subjective attitude that something is true or a state of affairs is the case. A subjective attitude is a mental state of having some stance, take, or opinion about something. In epistemology, philosophers use the term &quot;belief&quot; to refer to attitudes about the world which can be either true or false. To believe something is to take it to be true; for instance, to believe that snow is white is comparable to accepting the truth of the proposition &quot;snow is white&quot;. However, holding a belief does not require active introspection. For example, few individuals carefully consider whether or not the sun will rise tomorrow, simply assuming that it will. Moreover, beliefs need not be &quot;occurrent&quot; (e.g. a person actively thinking &quot;snow is white&quot;), but can instead be &quot;dispositional&quot; (e.g. a person who if asked about the color of snow would assert &quot;snow is white&quot;).

There are various ways that contemporary philosophers have tried to describe beliefs, including as representations of ways that the world could be (Jerry Fodor), as dispositions to act as if certain things are true (Roderick Chisholm), as interpretive schemes for making sense of someone&#x27;s actions (Daniel Dennett and Donald Davidson), or as mental states that fill a particular function (Hilary Putnam). Some have also attempted to offer significant revisions to our notion of belief, including eliminativists about belief who argue that there is no phenomenon in the natural world which corresponds to our folk psychological concept of belief (Paul Churchland) and formal epistemologists who aim to replace our bivalent notion of belief (&quot;either we have a belief or we don&#x27;t have a belief&quot;) with the more permissive, probabilistic notion of credence (&quot;there is an entire spectrum of degrees of belief, not a simple dichotomy between belief and non-belief&quot;).

Beliefs are the subject of various important philosophical debates. Notable examples include: &quot;What is the rational way to revise one&#x27;s beliefs when presented with various sorts of evidence?&quot;, &quot;Is the content of our beliefs entirely determined by our mental states, or do the relevant facts have any bearing on our beliefs (e.g. if I believe that I&#x27;m holding a glass of water, is the non-mental fact that water is H2O part of the content of that belief)?&quot;, &quot;How fine-grained or coarse-grained are our beliefs?&quot;, and &quot;Must it be possible for a belief to be expressible in language, or are there non-linguistic beliefs?&quot;

== Conceptions ==
Various conceptions of the essential features of beliefs have been proposed, but there is no consensus as to which is the right one. &quot;Representationalism&quot; is the traditionally dominant position. Its most popular version maintains that attitudes toward representations, which are typically associated with propositions, are mental attitudes that constitute beliefs. These attitudes are part of the internal constitution of the mind holding the attitude. This view contrasts with &quot;functionalism&quot;, which defines beliefs not in terms of the internal constitution of the mind but in terms of the function or the causal role played by beliefs. According to &quot;dispositionalism&quot;, beliefs are identified with dispositions to behave in certain ways. This view can be seen as a form of functionalism, defining beliefs in terms of the behavior they tend to cause. &quot;Interpretationism&quot; constitutes another conception, which has gained popularity in contemporary philosophy. It holds that the beliefs of an entity are in some sense dependent on or relative to someone&#x27;s interpretation of this entity. &quot;Representationalism&quot; tends to be associated with mind-body-dualism. &quot;Naturalist&quot; considerations against this dualism are among the motivations for choosing one of the alternative conceptions.

=== Representationalism ===
Representationalism characterizes beliefs in terms of mental representations. Representations are usually defined as objects with semantic propertieslike having content, referring to something, or being true or false. Beliefs form a special class of mental representations since they do not involve sensory qualities in order to represent something, unlike perceptions or episodic memories. Because of this, it seems natural to construe beliefs as attitudes towards propositions, which also constitute non-sensory representations, i.e. as propositional attitudes. As mental attitudes, beliefs are characterized by both their content and their mode. The content of an attitude is what this attitude is directed at: its object. Propositional attitudes are directed at propositions. Beliefs are usually distinguished from other propositional attitudes, like desires, by their mode or the way in which they are directed at propositions. The mode of beliefs has a mind-to-world direction of fit: beliefs try to represent the world as it is; they do not, unlike desires, involve an intention to change it. For example, if Rahul believes that it will be sunny today, then he has a mental attitude towards the proposition &quot;It will be sunny today&quot; which affirms that this proposition is true. This is different from Sofía&#x27;s desire that it will be sunny today, despite the fact that both Rahul and Sofía have attitudes toward the same proposition. The mind-to-world direction of fit of beliefs is sometimes expressed by saying that beliefs aim at truth. This aim is also reflected in the tendency to revise one&#x27;s belief upon receiving new evidence that an existing belief is false. Upon hearing a forecast of bad weather, Rahul is likely to change his mental attitude but Sofía is not.

There are different ways of conceiving how mental representations are realized in the mind. One form of this is the &quot;language of thought hypothesis&quot;, which claims that mental representations have a language-like structure, sometimes referred to as &quot;mentalese&quot;. Just like regular language, this involves simple elements that are combined in various ways according to syntactic rules to form more complex elements that act as bearers of meaning. On this conception, holding a belief would involve storing such a complex element in one&#x27;s mind. Different beliefs are separated from each other in that they correspond to different elements stored in the mind. A more holistic alternative to the &quot;language of thought hypothesis&quot; is the &quot;map-conception&quot;, which uses an analogy of maps to elucidate the nature of beliefs. According to this view, the belief system of a mind should be conceived of not as a set of many individual sentences but as a map encoding the information contained in these sentences. For example, the fact that Brussels is halfway between Paris and Amsterdam can be expressed both linguistically as a sentence and in a map through its internal geometrical relations.

=== Functionalism ===
Functionalism contrasts with representationalism in that it defines beliefs not in terms of the internal constitution of the mind but in terms of the function or the causal role played by them. This view is often combined with the idea that the same belief can be realized in various ways and that it does not matter how it is realized as long as it plays the causal role characteristic to it. As an analogy, a hard drive is defined in a functionalist manner: it performs the function of storing and retrieving digital data. This function can be realized in many different ways: being made of plastic or steel, or using magnetism or laser. Functionalists hold that something similar is true for beliefs (or mental states in general). Among the roles relevant to beliefs is their relation to perceptions and to actions: perceptions usually cause beliefs and beliefs cause actions. For example, seeing that a traffic light has switched to red is usually associated with a belief that the light is red, which in turn causes the driver to bring the car to a halt. Functionalists use such characteristics to define beliefs: whatever is caused by perceptions in a certain way and also causes behavior in a certain way is called a belief. This is not just true for humans but may include animals, hypothetical aliens or even computers. From this perspective, it would make sense to ascribe the belief that a traffic light is red to a self-driving car behaving just like a human driver.

Dispositionalism is sometimes seen as a specific form of functionalism. It defines beliefs only concerning their role as causes of behavior or as dispositions to behave in a certain way. For example, a belief that there is a pie in the pantry is associated with the disposition to affirm this when asked and to go to the pantry when hungry. While it is uncontroversial that beliefs shape our behavior, the thesis that beliefs can be defined exclusively through their role in producing behavior has been contested. The problem arises because the mechanisms shaping our behavior seem to be too complex to single out the general contribution of one particular belief for any possible situation. For example, one may decide not to affirm that there is a pie in the pantry when asked because one wants to keep it secret. Or one might not eat the pie despite being hungry, because one also believes that it is poisoned. Due to this complexity, we are unable to define even a belief as simple as this one in terms of the behavioral dispositions for which it could be responsible.

=== Interpretationism ===
According to interpretationism, the beliefs of an entity are in some sense dependent on, or relative to, someone&#x27;s interpretation of this entity. Daniel Dennett is an important defender of such a position. He holds that we ascribe beliefs to entities in order to predict how they will behave. Entities with simple behavioral patterns can be described using physical laws or in terms of their function. Dennett refers to these forms of explanation as the &quot;physical stance&quot; and the &quot;design stance&quot;. These stances are contrasted with the intentional stance, which is applied to entities with a more complex behavior by ascribing beliefs and desires to these entities. For example, we can predict that a chess player will move her queen to f7 if we ascribe to her the desire to win the game and the belief that this move will achieve that. The same procedure can also be applied to predicting how a chess computer will behave. The entity has the belief in question if this belief can be used to predict its behavior. Having a belief is relative to an interpretation since there may be different equally good ways of ascribing beliefs to predict behavior. So there may be another interpretation that predicts the move of the queen to f7 that does not involve the belief that this move will win the game. Another version of interpretationism is due to Donald Davidson, who uses the thought experiment of radical interpretation, in which the goal is to make sense of the behavior and language of another person from scratch without any knowledge of this person&#x27;s language. This process involves ascribing beliefs and desires to the speaker. The speaker really has these beliefs if this project can be successful in principle.

Interpretationism can be combined with eliminativism and instrumentalism about beliefs. Eliminativists hold that, strictly speaking, there are no beliefs. Instrumentalists agree with eliminativists but add that belief-ascriptions are useful nonetheless. This usefulness can be explained in terms of interpretationism: belief-ascriptions help us in predicting how entities will behave. It has been argued that interpretationism can also be understood in a more realistic sense: that entities really have the beliefs ascribed to them and that these beliefs participate in the causal network. But, for this to be possible, it may be necessary to define interpretationism as a methodology and not as an ontological outlook on beliefs.

=== Origins ===
Biologist Lewis Wolpert discusses the importance of causal beliefs and associates the making and use of tools with the origin of human beliefs.

=== Historical ===
In the context of Ancient Greek thought, three related concepts were identified regarding the concept of belief: &quot;pistis,&quot; &quot;doxa,&quot; and &quot;dogma.&quot; Simplified, &quot;Pistis&quot; refers to &quot;trust&quot; and &quot;confidence,&quot; &quot;doxa&quot; refers to &quot;opinion&quot; and &quot;acceptance,&quot; and &quot;dogma&quot; refers to the positions of a philosopher or of a philosophical school such as Stoicism.

== Types ==
Beliefs can be categorized into various types depending on their ontological status, their degree, their object or their semantic properties.

=== Occurrent and dispositional ===
Having an occurrent belief that the Grand Canyon is in Arizona involves entertaining the representation associated with this belieffor example, by actively thinking about it. But the great majority of our beliefs are not active most of the time: they are merely dispositional. They usually become activated or occurrent when needed or relevant in some way and then fall back into their dispositional state afterwards. For example, the belief that 57 is greater than 14 was probably dispositional to the reader before reading this sentence, has become occurrent while reading it and may soon become dispositional again as the mind focuses elsewhere. The distinction between occurrent and dispositional beliefs is sometimes identified with the distinction between conscious and unconscious beliefs. But it has been argued that, despite overlapping, the two distinctions do not match. The reason for this is that beliefs can shape one&#x27;s behaviour and be involved in one&#x27;s reasoning even if the subject is not conscious of them. Such beliefs are cases of unconscious occurrent mental states. On this view, being occurrent corresponds to being active, either consciously or unconsciously.

A dispositional belief is not the same as a disposition to believe. We have various dispositions to believe given the right perceptions; for example, to believe that it is raining given a perception of rain. Without this perception, there is still a disposition to believe but no actual dispositional belief. On a dispositionalist conception of belief, there are no occurrent beliefs, since all beliefs are defined in terms of dispositions.

=== Full and partial ===
An important dispute in formal epistemology concerns the question of whether beliefs should be conceptualized as &quot;full&quot; beliefs or as &quot;partial&quot; beliefs. Full beliefs are all-or-nothing attitudes: either one has a belief in a proposition or one does not. This conception is sufficient to understand many belief ascriptions found in everyday language: for example, Pedro&#x27;s belief that the Earth is bigger than the Moon. But some cases involving comparisons between beliefs are not easily captured through full beliefs alone: for example, that Pedro&#x27;s belief that the Earth is bigger than the Moon is more certain than his belief that the Earth is bigger than Venus. Such cases are most naturally analyzed in terms of partial beliefs involving degrees of belief, so-called &quot;credences&quot;. The higher the degree of a belief, the more certain the believer is that the believed proposition is true. This is usually formalized by numbers between 0 and 1: a degree of 1 represents an absolutely certain belief, a belief of 0 corresponds to an absolutely certain disbelief and all the numbers in between correspond to intermediate degrees of certainty. In the Bayesian approach, these degrees are interpreted as subjective probabilities: e.g. a belief of degree 0.9 that it will rain tomorrow means that the agent thinks that the probability of rain tomorrow is 90%. Bayesianism uses this relation between beliefs and probability to define the norms of rationality in terms of the laws of probability. This includes both synchronic laws about what one should believe at any moment and diachronic laws about how one should revise one&#x27;s beliefs upon receiving new evidence.

The central question in the dispute between full and partial beliefs is whether these two types are really distinct types or whether one type can be explained in terms of the other. One answer to this question is called the &quot;Lockean thesis&quot;. It states that partial beliefs are basic and that full beliefs are to be conceived as partial beliefs above a certain threshold: for example, every belief above 0.9 is a full belief. Defenders of a primitive notion of full belief, on the other hand, have tried to explain partial beliefs as full beliefs about probabilities. On this view, having a partial belief of degree 0.9 that it will rain tomorrow is the same as having a full belief that the probability of rain tomorrow is 90%. Another approach circumvents the notion of probability altogether and replaces degrees of belief with degrees of disposition to revise one&#x27;s full belief. From this perspective, both a belief of degree 0.6 and a belief of degree 0.9 may be seen as full beliefs. The difference between them is that the former belief can readily be changed upon receiving new evidence while the latter is more stable.

=== Belief-in and belief-that ===
Traditionally, philosophers have mainly focused in their inquiries concerning belief on the notion of &quot;belief-that&quot;. Belief-that can be characterized as a propositional attitude to a claim which is either true or false. &quot;Belief-in&quot;, on the other hand, is more closely related to notions like trust or faith in that it refers usually to an attitude to persons. &quot;Belief-in&quot; plays a central role in many religious traditions in which &quot;belief in God&quot; is one of the central virtues of their followers. The difference between belief-in and belief-that is sometimes blurry since various expressions using the term &quot;belief in&quot; seem to be translatable into corresponding expressions using the term &quot;belief that&quot; instead. For example, a &quot;belief in&quot; fairies may be said to be a &quot;belief that&quot; fairies exist. In this sense, belief-in is often used when the entity is not real, or its existence is in doubt. Typical examples would include: &quot;he believes in witches and ghosts&quot; or &quot;many children believe in Santa Claus&quot; or &quot;I believe in a deity&quot;. Not all usages of belief-in concern the existence of something: some are &quot;commendatory&quot; in that they express a positive attitude towards their object. It has been suggested that these cases can also be accounted for in terms of belief-that. For example, a &quot;belief in&quot; marriage could be translated as a &quot;belief that&quot; marriage is good. Belief-in is used in a similar sense when expressing self-confidence or faith in one&#x27;s self or one&#x27;s abilities.

Defenders of a reductive account of belief-in have used this line of thought to argue that &quot;belief in God&quot; can be analyzed in a similar way: e.g. that it amounts to a belief that God exists with his characteristic attributes, like omniscience and omnipotence. Opponents of this account often concede that belief-in may entail various forms of belief-that, but that there are additional aspects to belief-in that are not reducible to belief-that. For example, a &quot;belief in&quot; an ideal may involve the &quot;belief that&quot; this ideal is something good, but it additionally involves a positive evaluative attitude toward this ideal that goes beyond a mere propositional attitude. Applied to the &quot;belief in&quot; God, opponents of the reductive approach may hold that a &quot;belief that&quot; God exists may be a necessary pre-condition for &quot;belief in&quot; God, but that it is not sufficient.

=== &quot;De dicto&quot; and &quot;de re&quot; ===

The difference between &quot;de dicto&quot; and &quot;de re&quot; beliefs or the corresponding ascriptions concerns the contributions singular terms like names and other referential devices make to the semantic properties of the belief or its ascription. In regular contexts, the truth-value of a sentence does not change upon substitution of co-referring terms. For example, since the names &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Clark Kent&quot; refer to the same person, we can replace one with the other in the sentence &quot;Superman is strong&quot; without changing its truth-value; this issue is more complicated in case of belief ascriptions. For example, Lois believes that Superman is strong but she does not believe that Clark Kent is strong. This difficulty arises due to the fact that she does not know that the two names refer to the same entity. Beliefs or belief ascriptions for which this substitution does not generally work are &quot;de dicto&quot;, otherwise, they are &quot;de re&quot;. In a &quot;de re&quot; sense, Lois does believe that Clark Kent is strong, while in a &quot;de dicto&quot; sense she does not. The contexts corresponding to &quot;de dicto&quot; ascriptions are known as referentially opaque contexts while &quot;de re&quot; ascriptions are referentially transparent.

===Collective belief===
A collective belief is referred to when people speak of what &quot;we&quot; believe when this is not simply elliptical for what &quot;we all&quot; believe.
Sociologist Émile Durkheim wrote of collective beliefs and proposed that they, like all &quot;social facts&quot;, &quot;inhered in&quot; social groups as opposed to individual persons. Jonathan Dancy states that &quot;Durkheim&#x27;s discussion of collective belief, though suggestive, is relatively obscure&quot;.
Margaret Gilbert has offered a related account in terms of the joint commitment of a number of persons as a body to accept a certain belief. According to this account, individuals who together collectively believe something need not personally believe it individually. Gilbert&#x27;s work on the topic has stimulated a developing literature among philosophers. One question that has arisen is whether and how philosophical accounts of belief in general need to be sensitive to the possibility of collective belief.

Collective belief can play a role in social control
and serve as a touchstone for identifying and purging heresies,
deviancy
or political deviationism.

== Contents ==
As mental representations, beliefs have contents, which is what the belief is about or what it represents. Within philosophy, there are various disputes about how the contents of beliefs are to be understood. Holists and molecularists hold that the content of one particular belief depends on or is determined by other beliefs belonging to the same subject, which is denied by atomists. The question of dependence or determination also plays a central role in the internalism-externalism- debate. Internalism states that the contents of someone&#x27;s beliefs depend only on what is internal to that person and are determined entirely by things going on inside this person&#x27;s head. Externalism, on the other hand, holds that the relations to one&#x27;s environment also have a role to play in this.

=== Atomism, molecularism and holism ===
The disagreement between &quot;atomism, molecularism and holism&quot; concerns the question of how the content of one belief depends on the contents of other beliefs held by the same subject. Atomists deny such dependence relations, molecularists restrict them to only a few closely related beliefs while holists hold that they may obtain between any two beliefs, however unrelated they seem. For example, assume that Mei and Benjamin both affirm that Jupiter is a planet. The most straightforward explanation, given by the atomists, would be that they have the same belief, i.e. that they hold the same content to be true. But now assume that Mei also believes that Pluto is a planet, which is denied by Benjamin. This indicates that they have different concepts of planet, which would mean that they were affirming different contents when they both agreed that Jupiter is a planet. This reasoning leads to molecularism or holism because the content of the Jupiter-belief depends on the Pluto-belief in this example.

An important motivation for this position comes from W. V. Quine&#x27;s confirmational holism, which holds that, because of this interconnectedness, we cannot confirm or disconfirm individual hypotheses, that confirmation happens on the level of the theory as a whole. Another motivation is due to considerations of the nature of learning: it is often not possible to understand one concept, like force in Newtonian physics, without understanding other concepts, like mass or kinetic energy. One problem for holism is that genuine disagreements seem to be impossible or very rare: disputants would usually talk past each other since they never share exactly the same web of beliefs needed to determine the content of the source of the disagreement.

=== Internalism and externalism ===
&quot;Internalism and externalism&quot; disagree about whether the contents of our beliefs are determined only by what&#x27;s happening in our head or also by other factors. Internalists deny such a dependence on external factors. They hold that a person and a molecule-by-molecule copy would have exactly the same beliefs. Hilary Putnam objects to this position by way of his twin Earth thought experiment. He imagines a twin Earth in another part of the universe that is exactly like ours, except that their water has a different chemical composition despite behaving just like ours. According to Putnam, the reader&#x27;s thought that water is wet is about &quot;our water&quot; while the reader&#x27;s twin&#x27;s thought on twin Earth that water is wet is about &quot;their water&quot;. This is the case despite the fact that the two readers have the same molecular composition. So it seems necessary to include external factors in order to explain the difference. One problem with this position is that this difference in content does not bring any causal difference with it: the two readers act in exactly the same way. This casts doubt on the thesis that there is any genuine difference in need of explanation between the contents of the two beliefs.

==Epistemology==
Epistemology is concerned with delineating the boundary between justified belief and opinion, and involved generally with a theoretical philosophical study of knowledge. The primary problem in epistemology is to understand what is needed to have knowledge. In a notion derived from Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Theaetetus&quot;, where the epistemology of Socrates most clearly departs from that of the sophists, who appear to have defined knowledge as &quot;justified true belief&quot;. The tendency to base knowledge (&quot;episteme&quot;) on common opinion (&quot;doxa&quot;) Socrates dismisses, results from failing to distinguish a dispositive belief (&quot;doxa&quot;) from knowledge (&quot;episteme&quot;) when the opinion is regarded correct (n.b., &quot;orthé&quot; not &quot;alethia&quot;), in terms of right, and juristically so (according to the premises of the dialogue), which was the task of the rhetors to prove. Plato dismisses this possibility of an affirmative relation between opinion and knowledge even when the one who opines grounds his belief on the rule and is able to add justification (&quot;logos&quot;: reasonable and necessarily plausible assertions/evidence/guidance) to it. A belief can be based fully or partially on intuition.

Plato has been credited for the &quot;justified true belief&quot; theory of knowledge, even though Plato in the &quot;Theaetetus&quot; elegantly dismisses it, and even posits this argument of Socrates as a cause for his death penalty. The epistemologists, Gettier and Goldman, have questioned the &quot;justified true belief&quot; definition.

===Justified true belief===

Justified true belief is a definition of knowledge that gained approval during the Enlightenment, &quot;justified&quot; standing in contrast to &quot;revealed&quot;. There have been attempts to trace it back to Plato and his dialogues, more specifically in the &quot;Theaetetus,&quot; and the &quot;Meno&quot;. The concept of justified true belief states that in order to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition but also have justification for doing so. In more formal terms, an agent formula_1 knows that a proposition formula_2 is true if and only if:
* formula_2 is true
* formula_1 believes that formula_2 is true, and
* formula_1 is justified in believing that formula_2 is true

That theory of knowledge suffered a significant setback with the discovery of Gettier problems, situations in which the above conditions were seemingly met but where many philosophers deny that anything is known. Robert Nozick suggested a clarification of &quot;justification&quot; which he believed eliminates the problem: the justification has to be such that were the justification false, the knowledge would be false. Bernecker and Dretske (2000) argue that &quot;no epistemologist since Gettier has seriously and successfully defended the traditional view.&quot; On the other hand, Paul Boghossian argues that the justified true belief account is the &quot;standard, widely accepted&quot; definition of knowledge.

===Belief systems===
A belief system comprises a set of mutually supportive beliefs. The beliefs of any such system can be religious, philosophical, political, ideological, or a combination of these.

====Glover&#x27;s view====
The British philosopher Jonathan Glover, following Meadows (2008), says that beliefs are always part of a belief system, and that tenanted belief systems are difficult for the tenants to completely revise or reject. He suggests that beliefs have to be considered holistically, and that no belief exists in isolation in the mind of the believer. Each belief always implicates and relates to other beliefs. Glover provides the example of a patient with an illness who returns to a doctor, but the doctor says that the prescribed medicine is not working. At that point, the patient has a great deal of flexibility in choosing what beliefs to keep or reject: the patient could believe that the doctor is incompetent, that the doctor&#x27;s assistants made a mistake, that the patient&#x27;s own body is unique in some unexpected way, that Western medicine is ineffective, or even that Western science is entirely unable to discover truths about ailments.

This insight has relevance for inquisitors, missionaries, agitprop groups and . The British philosopher Stephen Law has described some belief systems (including belief in homeopathy, psychic powers, and alien abduction) as and says that such belief-systems can &quot;draw people in and hold them captive so they become willing slaves of claptrap ... if you get sucked in, it can be extremely difficult to think your way clear again&quot;.

==Religion==


Religion is a personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices; the service or worship of God or the supernatural. Religious belief is distinct from religious practice and from religious behaviours—with some believers not practicing religion and some practitioners not believing religion. &quot;Belief&quot; is no less of a theoretical term than is &quot;religion&quot;. Religious beliefs often relate to the existence, characteristics and worship of a deity or deities, to the idea of divine intervention in the universe and in human life, or to the deontological explanations for the values and practices centered on the teachings of a spiritual leader or community. In contrast to other belief systems, religious beliefs are usually codified.

===Forms===
A popular view holds that different religions each have identifiable and exclusive sets of beliefs or creeds, but surveys of religious belief have often found that the official doctrine and descriptions of the beliefs offered by religious authorities do not always agree with the privately held beliefs of those who identify as members of a particular religion. For a broad classification of the kinds of religious belief, see below.

====Fundamentalism====

First self-applied as a term to the conservative doctrine outlined by anti-modernist Protestants in the United States, &quot;fundamentalism&quot; in religious terms denotes strict adherence to an interpretation of scriptures that are generally associated with theologically conservative positions or traditional understandings of the text and are distrustful of innovative readings, new revelation, or alternative interpretations. Religious fundamentalism has been identified in the media as being associated with fanatical or zealous political movements around the world that have used a strict adherence to a particular religious doctrine as a means to establish political identity and to enforce societal norms.

====Orthodoxy====

First used in the context of Early Christianity, the term &quot;orthodoxy&quot; relates to religious belief that closely follows the edicts, apologies, and hermeneutics of a prevailing religious authority. In the case of Early Christianity, this authority was the communion of bishops, and is often referred to by the term &quot;Magisterium&quot;. The term &quot;orthodox&quot; was applied almost as an epithet to a group of Jewish believers who held to pre-Enlightenment understanding of Judaism—now known as Orthodox Judaism. The Eastern Orthodox Church of Christianity and the Catholic Church each consider themselves to be the true heir to Early Christian belief and practice. The antonym of &quot;orthodox&quot; is &quot;heterodox&quot;, and those adhering to orthodoxy often accuse the heterodox of apostasy, schism, or heresy.

====Modernism/reform====
The Renaissance and later the Enlightenment in Europe exhibited varying degrees of religious tolerance and intolerance towards new and old religious ideas. The &quot;philosophes&quot; took particular exception to many of the more fantastical claims of religions and directly challenged religious authority and the prevailing beliefs associated with the established churches. In response to the liberalizing political and social movements, some religious groups attempted to integrate Enlightenment ideals of rationality, equality, and individual liberty into their belief systems, especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Reform Judaism and Liberal Christianity offer two examples of such religious associations.

=== Attitudes to other religions ===
Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions or by other religious denominations in a variety of ways.

====Exclusivism====

People with exclusivist beliefs typically explain other beliefs either as in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. This approach is a fairly consistent feature among smaller new religious movements that often rely on doctrine that claims a unique revelation by the founders or leaders, and considers it a matter of faith that the &quot;correct&quot; religion has a monopoly on truth. All three major Abrahamic monotheistic religions have passages in their holy scriptures that attest to the primacy of the scriptural testimony, and indeed monotheism itself is often vouched as an innovation characterized specifically by its explicit rejection of earlier polytheistic faiths.

Some exclusivist faiths incorporate a specific element of proselytization. This is a strongly-held belief in the Christian tradition which follows the doctrine of the Great Commission, and is less emphasized by the Islamic faith where the Quranic edict &quot;There shall be no compulsion in religion&quot; (2:256) is often quoted as a justification for toleration of alternative beliefs. The Jewish tradition does not actively seek out converts.

Exclusivism correlates with conservative, fundamentalist, and orthodox approaches of many religions, while pluralistic and syncretist approaches either explicitly downplay or reject the exclusivist tendencies within a religion.

====Inclusivism====
People with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences. This attitude is sometimes associated with Interfaith dialogue or with the Christian Ecumenical movement, though in principle such attempts at pluralism are not necessarily inclusivist and many actors in such interactions (for example, the Roman Catholic Church) still hold to exclusivist dogma while participating in inter-religious organizations. Explicitly inclusivist religions include many that are associated with the New Age movement, as well as modern reinterpretations of Hinduism and Buddhism. The Baháʼí Faith considers it doctrine that there is truth in all faith systems.

Pluralism and syncretism are two closely related concepts. People with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. People with syncretic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experiences and contexts (eclecticism). Unitarian Universalism exemplifies a syncretic faith.

===Adherence===

Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:
* Some see belief in a deity as necessary for moral behavior.
* Some regard religious practices as serene, beautiful, and conducive to religious experiences, which in turn support religious beliefs.
* Organized religions promote a sense of community among their followers, and the moral and cultural common ground of these communities makes them attractive to people with similar values. Indeed, while religious beliefs and practices are usually connected, some individuals with substantially secular beliefs still participate in religious practices for cultural reasons.
* Each religion asserts that it is a means by which its adherents may come into closer contact with the Divine, with Truth, and with spiritual power. They all promise to free adherents from spiritual bondage, and to bring them into spiritual freedom. It naturally follows that a religion which can free its adherents from deception, sin, and spiritual death will have significant mental-health benefits. Abraham Maslow&#x27;s research after World War II showed that Holocaust survivors tended to be those who held strong religious beliefs (not necessarily temple attendance, etc.), suggesting that belief helped people cope in extreme circumstances. Humanistic psychology went on to investigate how religious or spiritual identity may have correlations with longer lifespan and better health. The study found that humans may particularly need religious ideas to serve various emotional needs such as the need to feel loved, the need to belong to homogeneous groups, the need for understandable explanations and the need for a guarantee of ultimate justice. Other factors may involve sense of purpose, sense of identity, or a sense of contact with the divine. See also &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot;, by Viktor Frankl, detailing his experience with the importance of religion in surviving the Holocaust. Critics assert that the very fact that religion was the primary selector for research subjects may have introduced a bias, and that the fact that all subjects were Holocaust survivors may also have had an effect. According to Larson et al. (2000), &quot;[m]ore longitudinal research with better multidimensional measures will help further clarify the roles of these [religious] factors and whether they are beneficial or harmful.&quot;

Psychologist James Alcock also summarizes a number of apparent benefits which reinforce religious belief. These include prayer appearing to account for successful resolution of problems, &quot;a bulwark against existential anxiety and fear of annihilation,&quot; an increased sense of control, companionship with one&#x27;s deity, a source of self-significance, and group identity.

===Apostasy===
Typical reasons for rejection of religion include:
* Some people regard certain fundamental doctrines of some religions as illogical, contrary to experience, or unsupported by sufficient evidence; such people may reject one or more religions for those reasons. Even some believers may have difficulty accepting particular religious assertions or doctrines. Some people believe the body of evidence available to humans to be insufficient to justify certain religious beliefs. They may thus disagree with religious interpretations of ethics and human purpose, or with various creation myths. This reason has perhaps been aggravated by the protestations and emphases of some fundamentalist Christians.
* Some religions include beliefs that certain groups of people are inferior or sinful and deserve contempt, persecution, or even death, and that non-believers will be punished for their unbelief in an after-life. Adherents to a religion may feel antipathy to unbelievers. Numerous examples exist of people of one religion or sect using religion as an excuse to murder people with different religious beliefs. To mention just a few examples:
** the slaughter of the Huguenots by French Catholics in the sixteenth century
** Hindus and Muslims killing each other when Pakistan separated from India in 1947
** the persecution and killing of Shiite Muslims by Sunni Muslims in Iraq
** the murder of Protestants by Catholics and vice versa in Ireland (both of these examples in the late twentieth century)
** the Israeli–Palestinian conflict that continues – According to some critics of religion, such beliefs can encourage completely unnecessary conflicts and in some cases even wars. Many atheists believe that, because of this, religion is incompatible with world peace, freedom, civil rights, equality, and good government. On the other hand, most religions perceive atheism as a threat and will vigorously and even violently defend themselves against religious sterilization, making the attempt to remove public religious practices a source of strife.
* Some people may be unable to accept the values that a specific religion promotes and will therefore not join that religion. They may also be unable to accept the proposition that those who do not believe will go to hell or be damned, especially if said nonbelievers are close to the person.

==Psychology==

Mainstream psychology and related disciplines have traditionally treated belief as if it were the simplest form of mental representation and therefore one of the building blocks of conscious thought. Philosophers have tended to be more abstract in their analysis, and much of the work examining the viability of the belief concept stems from philosophical analysis.

The concept of belief presumes a subject (the believer) and an object of belief (the proposition). Like other propositional attitudes, belief implies the existence of mental states and intentionality, both of which are hotly debated topics in the philosophy of mind, whose foundations and relation to brain states are still controversial.

Beliefs are sometimes divided into core beliefs (that are actively thought about) and dispositional beliefs (that may be ascribed to someone who has not thought about the issue). For example, if asked &quot;do you believe tigers wear pink pajamas?&quot; a person might answer that they do not, despite the fact they may never have thought about this situation before.

Philosopher Lynne Rudder Baker has outlined four main contemporary approaches to belief in her book &quot;Saving Belief&quot;:
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is correct – Sometimes called the &quot;mental sentence theory,&quot; in this conception, beliefs exist as coherent entities, and the way we talk about them in everyday life is a valid basis for scientific endeavor. Jerry Fodor was one of the principal defenders of this point of view.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief may not be entirely correct, but it is close enough to make some useful predictions – This view argues that we will eventually reject the idea of belief as we know it now, but that there may be a correlation between what we take to be a belief when someone says &quot;I believe that snow is white&quot; and how a future theory of psychology will explain this behavior. Philosopher Stephen Stich has argued for this particular understanding of belief.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong and will be completely superseded by a radically different theory that will have no use for the concept of belief as we know it – Known as eliminativism, this view (most notably proposed by Paul and Patricia Churchland) argues that the concept of belief is like obsolete theories of times past such as the four humours theory of medicine, or the phlogiston theory of combustion. In these cases science has not provided us with a more detailed account of these theories, but completely rejected them as valid scientific concepts to be replaced by entirely different accounts. The Churchland argue that our common-sense concept of belief is similar in that as we discover more about neuroscience and the brain, the inevitable conclusion will be to reject the belief hypothesis in its entirety.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong; however, treating people, animals, and even computers as if they had beliefs is often a successful strategy – The major proponents of this view, Daniel Dennett and Lynne Rudder Baker, are both eliminativists in that they hold that beliefs are not a scientifically valid concept, but they do not go as far as rejecting the concept of belief as a predictive device. Dennett gives the example of playing a computer at chess. While few people would agree that the computer held beliefs, treating the computer as if it did (e.g. that the computer believes that taking the opposition&#x27;s queen will give it a considerable advantage) is likely to be a successful and predictive strategy. In this understanding of belief, named by Dennett &quot;the intentional stance&quot;, belief-based explanations of mind and behaviour are at a different level of explanation and are not reducible to those based on fundamental neuroscience, although both may be explanatory at their own level.
Strategic approaches make a distinction between rules, norms and beliefs as follows:
* Rules. Explicit regulative processes such as policies, laws, inspection routines, or incentives. Rules function as a coercive regulator of behavior and are dependent upon the imposing entity&#x27;s ability to enforce them.
* Norms. Regulative mechanisms accepted by the social collective. Norms are enforced by normative mechanisms within the organization and are not strictly dependent upon law or regulation.
* Beliefs. The collective perception of fundamental truths governing behavior. The adherence to accepted and shared beliefs by members of a social system will likely persist and be difficult to change over time. Strong beliefs about determinant factors (i.e., security, survival, or honor) are likely to cause a social entity or group to accept rules and norms.

===Belief formation and revision===

Belief revision is a term commonly used to refer to the modification of beliefs. An extensive amount of scientific research and philosophical discussion exists around belief revision. Generally speaking, the process of belief revision entails the believer weighing the set of truths and/or evidence, and the dominance of a set of truths or evidence on an alternative to a held belief can lead to revision. One process of belief revision is Bayesian updating (or Bayesian inference) and is often referenced for its mathematical basis and conceptual simplicity. However, such a process may not be representative for individuals whose beliefs are not easily characterized as probabilistic.

There are several techniques for individuals or groups to change the beliefs of others; these methods generally fall under the umbrella of persuasion. Persuasion can take on more specific forms such as consciousness raising when considered in an activist or political context. Belief modification may also occur as a result of the experience of outcomes. Because goals are based, in part on beliefs, the success or failure at a particular goal may contribute to modification of beliefs that supported the original goal.

Whether or not belief modification actually occurs is dependent not only on the extent of truths or evidence for the alternative belief, but also characteristics outside the specific truths or evidence. This includes, but is not limited to: the source characteristics of the message, such as credibility; social pressures; the anticipated consequences of a modification; or the ability of the individual or group to act on the modification. Therefore, individuals seeking to achieve belief modification in themselves or others need to consider all possible forms of resistance to belief revision.

Glover maintains that any person can continue to hold any belief if they would really like to (for example, with help from &quot;ad hoc&quot; hypotheses). One belief can be held fixed, and other beliefs will be altered around it. Glover warns that some beliefs may not be entirely explicitly believed (for example, some people may not realize they have racist belief-systems adopted from their environment as a child). Glover believes that people tend to first realize that beliefs can change, and may be contingent on their upbringing, around age 12 or 15.

 Glover emphasizes that beliefs are difficult to change. He says that one may try to rebuild one&#x27;s beliefs on more secure foundations (axioms), like building a new house, but warns that this may not be possible. Glover offers the example of René Descartes, saying: &quot;[Descartes] starts off with the characteristic beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman; he then junks the lot, he rebuilds the system, and somehow it looks a lot like the beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman.&quot; To Glover, belief systems are not like houses but are instead like boats. As Glover puts it: &quot;Maybe the whole thing needs rebuilding, but inevitably at any point you have to keep enough of it intact to keep floating.&quot;

====Models of belief formation====

Psychologists study belief formation and the relationship between beliefs and actions. Three types of &quot;models of belief formation&quot; and change have been proposed: conditional inference process models, linear models and information processing models.

Conditional inference process models emphasize the role of inference for belief formation. When asked to estimate the likelihood that a statement is true, people allegedly search their memory for information that has implications for the validity of this statement. Once this information has been identified, they estimate the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were true, and the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were false. If their estimates for these two probabilities differ, people average them, weighting each by the likelihood that the information is true and false. Thus, information bears directly on beliefs of another, related statement.

Unlike the previous model, linear models take into consideration the possibility of multiple factors influencing belief formation. Using regression procedures, these models predict belief formation on the basis of several different pieces of information, with weights assigned to each piece on the basis of their relative importance.

Information processing models address the fact that the responses people have to belief-relevant information is unlikely to be predicted from the objective basis of the information that they can recall at the time their beliefs are reported. Instead, these responses reflect the number and meaning of the thoughts that people have about the message at the time that they encounter it.

Some influences on people&#x27;s belief formation include:
* Internalization of beliefs during childhood, which can form and shape humans&#x27; beliefs in different domains. Albert Einstein is often quoted as having said that &quot;Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.&quot; Political beliefs depend most strongly on the political beliefs most common in the community where one lives. Most individuals believe the religion they were taught in childhood.
* Charismatic leaders can form or modify beliefs (even if those beliefs fly in the face of all previous beliefs). Rational individuals need to reconcile their direct reality with any said belief; therefore, if belief is not present or possible, it reflects the fact that contradictions were necessarily overcome using cognitive dissonance.
* Advertising can form or change beliefs through repetition, shock, or association with images of sex, love, beauty, and other strong positive emotions. Contrary to intuition, a delay, known as the sleeper effect, instead of immediate succession may increase an advertisement&#x27;s ability to persuade viewer&#x27;s beliefs if a discounting cue is present.
* Physical trauma, especially to the head, can radically alter a person&#x27;s beliefs.

However, even educated people, well aware of the process by which beliefs form, still strongly cling to their beliefs, and act on those beliefs even against their own self-interest. In her book &quot;Leadership Therapy&quot;, Anna Rowley states: &quot;You want your beliefs to change. It&#x27;s proof that you are keeping your eyes open, living fully, and welcoming everything that the world and people around you can teach you.&quot; This view implies that peoples&#x27; beliefs may evolve as they gain new experiences.

===Prediction===
Different psychological models have tried to predict people&#x27;s beliefs and some of them try to estimate the exact probabilities of beliefs. For example, Robert Wyer developed a model of subjective probabilities. When people rate the likelihood of a certain statement (e.g., &quot;It will rain tomorrow&quot;), this rating can be seen as a subjective probability value. The subjective probability model posits that these subjective probabilities follow the same rules as objective probabilities. For example, the law of total probability might be applied to predict a subjective probability value. Wyer found that this model produces relatively accurate predictions for probabilities of single events and for changes in these probabilities, but that the probabilities of several beliefs linked by &quot;and&quot; or &quot;or&quot; do not follow the model as well.

===Delusion===
In the DSM-5, delusions are defined as fixed false beliefs that are not changed even when confronted with conflicting evidence.

=== Belief studies ===
There is research investigating specific beliefs, types of beliefs and patterns of beliefs. For example, a study estimated contemporary prevalence and associations with belief in witchcraft around the world, which (in its data) varied between 9% and 90% between nations and is still a widespread element in worldviews globally. It also shows associations such as with lower &quot;innovative activity&quot;, higher levels of anxiety, lower life expectancy, and higher religiosity.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1371/journal.pone.0276872&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other research is investigating beliefs in misinformation and their resistance to correction, including with respect to misinformation countermeasures. It describes cognitive, social and affective processes that leave people vulnerable to the formation of false beliefs. A study introduced the concept of &quot;false social reality&quot; which refers to widespread perceptions of public opinion that are shown to be false, such as underestimated general public support in the U.S. for climate change mitigation policies. Studies also suggested some uses of psychedelics can shift beliefs in some humans in certain ways, such as increasing attribution of consciousness to various entities (including plants and inanimate objects) and towards panpsychism and fatalism.

=== Emotion and beliefs ===

Research has indicated that emotion and cognition act in conjunction to produce beliefs, and more specifically emotion plays a vital role in the formation and maintenance of beliefs.

<text>The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra (SPCO) is an American chamber orchestra based in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Its principal concert venue is the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts. In collaboration with five artistic partners, the orchestra&#x27;s musicians present more than 130 concerts and educational programs each year in several venues throughout the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. The SPCO is regularly heard on American Public Media&#x27;s nationally syndicated radio programs &quot;Performance Today&quot; and SymphonyCast. 

==History==
Leopold Sipe was the SPCO&#x27;s first music director, from 1959 to 1971. Dennis Russell Davies succeeded Sipe from 1972 to 1980. During Davies&#x27;s tenure, the SPCO recorded Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot; at Sound 80 studios, one of the earliest digital audio recordings to see commercial release.

In 1995, during Hugh Wolff&#x27;s tenure as music director (1992–2000), the SPCO began its CONNECT education program. It reached 6,000 students annually in 16 Minneapolis and Saint Paul Public Schools.

The last music director of the SPCO was Andreas Delfs, from 2001 to 2004. Beginning with the 2004–05 season, the SPCO adopted a new artistic model that eliminated the position of music director and created positions for several &quot;Artistic Partners&quot;, prominent established musicians. Under this model the SPCO musicians have a much higher degree of artistic control.

In 2018, the SPCO and its Artistic Partner Patricia Kopatchinskaja won the Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance, recognizing a recording of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;.

===2012-2013 lockout===
In October 2012, after months of negotiations between musicians and management, the SPCO locked out its union musicians. Six months later, musicians approved a three-year labor agreement that cut their pay by $15,000 per year, reduced the SPCO from 34 players to 28, and offered buyouts to musicians 55 years and older.

<text>Neil Mullane Finn (born 27 May 1958) is a New Zealand singer-songwriter and musician. He is best known for being a principal member of Split Enz, of which he shared lead duties with his brother Tim, and the lead singer, guitarist, and a founding member of Crowded House. He was also a member of Fleetwood Mac from 2018 until 2022. Ed O&#x27;Brien of Radiohead has hailed Finn as popular music&#x27;s &quot;most prolific writer of great songs&quot;.

Finn joined Split Enz in 1977 after the departure of founding member Phil Judd and facilitated the band&#x27;s shift away from art rock towards new wave pop. Gradually rising in creative prominence within the band, he wrote the majority of the band&#x27;s hits in the 1980s, including &quot;I Got You&quot;, &quot;One Step Ahead&quot;, &quot;History Never Repeats&quot;, and &quot;Message to My Girl&quot;. After Split Enz broke up in 1984, Finn helped form Crowded House with Split Enz&#x27;s final drummer Paul Hester and served as the band&#x27;s lead singer and principal songwriter. Crowded House achieved international success in 1987 when they released the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot;, written by Finn.

After Crowded House disbanded in 1996, Finn and his brother released two albums as the Finn Brothers, before reforming Crowded House in 2006. In April 2018, Finn joined Fleetwood Mac for their tour that year and was a member of the band until they disbanded in 2022. Finn has also recorded several successful solo albums, assembled diverse musicians for the 7 Worlds Collide project, and contributed to several film and television soundtracks.

==Early life==
Neil Mullane Finn was born on 27 May 1958, the youngest of four children, to Dick and Mary Finn in Te Awamutu, New Zealand. His mother, a devout Catholic who moved to New Zealand from Ireland at the age of two, maintained a religious influence over the family. Speaking of Catholicism, Finn stated &quot;It&#x27;s a great fertile ground for pulling lyrics out. [There&#x27;s] lots of good stuff going on in there, good rituals and imagery and lots of guilt. It&#x27;s a very potent combination. I think you&#x27;re blessed, really, to be brought up with some kind of weird dogma like that.&quot; His father, the son of a farmer from Waikato, served in the army in Italy and became an accountant during World War II. His parents instilled an &quot;inspiring admiration of music&quot; in young Finn; the family would often engage in sing-alongs around the family piano. In addition to music, Finn also enjoyed sports, particularly swimming, rugby, tennis, and biking.

As a child, Finn would often perform at family gatherings with his older brother Tim. Finn recalled, &quot;We&#x27;d sing all night. It was very much part of our upbringing... That was the first inkling of the seduction of live performance.&quot; He idolised his brother and wished to imitate his actions, learning to play guitar and piano at the same time Tim did. Tim was more public about his musical aspirations, and won ten shillings in his annual talent contest at school shortly after enrolling. When Tim left to study at Sacred Heart College, a boarding school in Auckland, eight-year-old Neil started playing a guitar that his older brother left behind. A natural performer, Finn was nicknamed &#x27;The Ant&#x27; by his family due to his determined and ambitious nature.

Finn attended Sacred Heart boarding school in Auckland and Te Awamutu College in Te Awamutu, Waikato. He decided to become a musician at the age of 12 and throughout his school years performed in prisons and hospitals, as well as at home gatherings.

==Career==
===1977–1984: Split Enz===

In 1976, Finn formed the group After Hours, with Mark Hough, Geoff Chunn, and Alan Brown. Not long after the band&#x27;s debut performance, Finn&#x27;s brother Tim invited him to join Split Enz in London, replacing original singer-songwriter Phil Judd. By 1980, he was sharing lead singer duties and wrote their first international hit, &quot;I Got You&quot;. Finn contributed significantly to the band&#x27;s later albums, and even briefly assumed leadership in the band&#x27;s final days when Tim Finn left in 1984.

===1985–1996: Crowded House===

After the breakup of Split Enz in 1984, Finn formed a new band called The Mullanes (Mullane being both his middle name and his mother&#x27;s maiden name) with Split Enz drummer Paul Hester, guitarist Craig Hooper (of The Reels), and bassist Nick Seymour (younger brother of Hunters &amp; Collectors leader Mark Seymour) who Finn met on the final Split Enz tour. Hooper left just before they recorded their first album, at which time the band was renamed Crowded House, inspired by the rental home they shared while recording in Los Angeles.

Crowded House went on to enjoy worldwide acclaim; particularly, with its two major hits &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot; (1987: US No. 2; Canada and New Zealand No. 1) and &quot;Weather With You&quot; (1992: UK No. 7). Both Neil and his brother Tim were appointed as Officers of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to music in the 1993 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. After releasing four albums—&quot;Crowded House&quot;, &quot;Temple of Low Men&quot;, &quot;Woodface&quot;, and &quot;Together Alone&quot;, the group broke up in 1996 and soon after released their greatest hits album &quot;Recurring Dream&quot;.
===1997–2006: Solo work===
Following the breakup of Crowded House, Finn embarked on a solo career. The album &quot;Afterglow&quot; was released in 1999, which contained previously unreleased Crowded House recordings. Finn appeared as part of the BBC Four&#x27;s &quot;Songwriters&#x27; Circle&quot; series in 1999, and explained that &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot; and &quot;Better Be Home Soon&quot; were both written quickly, with all of the elements of each song—such as lyrics and verses—emerging at the same time. Finn also sang the opening lines of The Verve song &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; to the opening chords of the latter song. Finn penned a theme song for the All Blacks&#x27; participation in the 1999 Rugby World Cup, &quot;Can You Hear Us?&quot;, that made it to the top of the New Zealand charts in October.

Finn has recorded four solo albums, &quot;Try Whistling This&quot; (1998), &quot;One Nil&quot; (2001), &quot;Dizzy Heights&quot; (2014), and &quot;Out of Silence&quot; (2017). &quot;One Nil&quot; was released in the US and Canada in a remixed version with two new tracks, one track deleted and reordering, and was renamed &quot;One All&quot; (2002). Neil and Tim Finn also collaborated on a Finn Brothers album, &quot;Finn&quot;, that was released in 1995.

In 2001, Finn released a live album/DVD (&quot;7 Worlds Collide&quot;) consisting of songs recorded at St James Theatre in Auckland with several other artists. Finn was also heavily involved in creating the 2001 soundtrack for the motion picture &quot;Rain&quot;. &quot;Everyone Is Here&quot;, a second Finn Brothers album, was released in 2004.

===2006–present: Reformation of Crowded House, family collaborations and Fleetwood Mac===
In January 2007, Crowded House reformed with Finn, Nick Seymour, Mark Hart, and new drummer Matt Sherrod, as Paul Hester had died in 2005. The group&#x27;s new album &quot;Time on Earth&quot; was released in June 2007. In the pre-release build up, they headlined a show at Coachella in April 2007. The band then commenced a world tour.

Finn appeared on fellow musician Missy Higgins&#x27; CD, &quot;On a Clear Night&quot; (2007).

Finn and his wife Sharon began a side project called Pajama Club in 2011. After Finn&#x27;s children, Liam and Elroy, left the family home to pursue their own musical careers, the two wondered what to do to fill the time left open by their children&#x27;s absence. The two decided to repair the music room in their Auckland home and begin making music of their own: &quot;We&#x27;ve had a bit more time on our hands since the boys left home, and we just decided to make a record. It was as simple as that. We called the group Pajama Club, because we were dressed in our pyjamas when we started.&quot; Sharon began to play the bass guitar and Neil sat behind the drum set, despite the fact that neither had played either instrument before.

On 23 October 2011, Finn performed with Ryan Adams and Janis Ian on BBC Four&#x27;s Series 2 Episode 4 of the series, &quot;Songwriters&#x27; Circle&quot;. The night resulted in controversy, ending with an awkward exchange between the performers when there seemingly was confusion between them about who was to perform and join in on each other&#x27;s songs.

During February and March 2013, Finn and Paul Kelly undertook their collaborative Goin&#x27; Your Way Tour of Australia. One of their performances at the Sydney Opera House was recorded for the live album, &quot;Goin&#x27; Your Way&quot; (8 November 2013). It was issued as a double CD, which peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It was also issued as a DVD, which peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Music DVD Chart.

Finn&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Dizzy Heights&quot;, was released in Australia and New Zealand on 7 February 2014 via Kobalt Label Services. His sons and his wife also play on the album. &quot;Dizzy Heights&quot; is his third solo album. 

On 15 April 2018, Fleetwood Mac announced that Finn had joined the band along with Heartbreakers&#x27; lead guitarist Mike Campbell. Both Finn and Campbell toured with Fleetwood Mac in the concert tour An Evening with Fleetwood Mac from October 2018 to November 2019.

In August 2018, Finn released the album &quot;Lightsleeper&quot; as a collaboration with his son Liam.

===Charity work===
In 1986, Finn performed with The Rock Party, a charity project initiated by the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) that included many Australasian musicians such as Reg Mombassa from Mental As Anything, Tim Finn, and Nick Seymour and Paul Hester of Crowded House. The Rock Party released a 12&quot; single entitled &quot;Everything To Live For&quot;.

In December 2008, several of the &quot;7 Worlds Collide&quot; lineup reconvened in Auckland, New Zealand to record &quot;The Sun Came Out&quot;, a charity album for Oxfam.

In March 2009, Neil Finn, with his son Liam, joined Tim Finn on stage at Melbourne&#x27;s charity Sound Relief concert at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, in support of the 2009 Victorian bushfires. Liam Finn played drums on a rendition of the Crowded House song &quot;Weather With You&quot;.

===Film and television===
Finn has contributed solo music to various film and TV soundtracks including &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, &quot;Boston Public&quot;, &quot;The Waiting Game&quot;, &quot;Antz&quot;, and &quot;Sports Night&quot;. In 2012, Finn recorded the song &quot;Song of the Lonely Mountain&quot;, which was featured in the end credits of Peter Jackson&#x27;s film adaptation &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot;.

Finn had a cameo acting role on the BBC Radio series &quot;Flight of the Conchords&quot;.

In 2023, Finn provided a voice cameo for the Australian children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Bluey&quot; in the third season.

==Personal life==
Finn married Sharon Dawn Johnson in February 1982. Finn and his wife have two sons, Liam Finn and Elroy Finn. Both are musicians.

<text>Lorne Michaels (born Lorne David Lipowitz; November 17, 1944) is a Canadian and American television writer and film producer. He created and produced &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1975–1980, 1985–present) and produced the &quot;Late Night&quot; series (since 1993), &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; (from 1989 to 1995), and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; (since 2014).

He has received 21 Primetime Emmy Awards from 106 nominations, holding the record as the most nominated individual in the award show&#x27;s history.

==Early life==
Lorne David Lipowitz was born to a Jewish family in Toronto, Ontario, on November 17, 1944, to Florence (née Becker) (1915-2001) and Abraham Lipowitz (1908-1959), who worked as a furrier.

Several sources incorrectly state that he was born on a kibbutz in the then-British mandate of Palestine, and that his Jewish family immigrated to Toronto, Ontario when he was an infant.

Michaels and his two younger siblings were raised in Toronto; he graduated from Forest Hill Collegiate Institute before attending University College at the University of Toronto, earning a Bachelor of Arts in English in 1966.

==Career==
===Early career===
Michaels began his career as a writer and broadcaster for CBC Radio, working with partner Hart Pomerantz. He and Pomerantz moved to Los Angeles from Toronto in 1968 to work as writers for &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; and &quot;The Beautiful Phyllis Diller Show&quot;. They returned to Canada to star in &quot;The Hart and Lorne Terrific Hour&quot;, a series of comedy specials that ran on CBC in the early 1970s.

Michaels returned to the United States in 1973 to write for &quot;The Burns and Shreiber Comedy Hour&quot;. This brought him to the attention of Lily Tomlin who hired him to produce a series of specials, the first of which won an Emmy. Michaels credits his work with Tomlin for giving him the credibility needed for NBC to hire him to create &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===

In 1975, Michaels created (with fellow NBC employee Dick Ebersol and president of the network Herb Schlosser) the TV show &quot;NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot;, which in 1977 changed its name to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (initially there was a name conflict with an ABC show titled &quot;Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell&quot;, which debuted September 20, 1975, and was cancelled on January 17, 1976). The show, which is performed live in front of a studio audience, immediately established a reputation for being cutting-edge and unpredictable. It became a vehicle for launching the careers of some of the most successful comedians in the United States.

Originally the producer of the show, Michaels was also a writer and later became executive producer. He occasionally appears on-screen as well, where he is known for his deadpan humor. Throughout the show&#x27;s history, &quot;SNL&quot; has been nominated for more than 156 Emmy Awards and has won 36. It has consistently been one of the highest-rated late-night television programs. Michaels has been with &quot;SNL&quot; for all seasons except for his hiatus in the early 1980s (seasons 6–10).

Michaels appeared in the show during the first season, where he offered The Beatles to reunite on the show. He later increased his offer to , but the money was never claimed. According to an interview with John Lennon in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, Lennon and Paul McCartney were in New York City that night and wanted to see the show. They decided against it though, as it was too late to get there in time, and they were both tired. This near-reunion was the basis for the TV movie &quot;Two of Us&quot;. On the episode airing November 20, 1976, musical guest George Harrison appeared, but Michaels told him the offer was conditional on all four members of the group showing up.

===Other work===
During the 1978-1979 season of &quot;SNL&quot;, Michaels was offered a deal to produce nine features from Paramount, but he turned it down to take a three-picture deal from Warner Brothers. The Warner Brothers deal didn&#x27;t net any produced movies. In the early 80s, he subsequently had a deal to produce movies for MGM and was developing a Father Guido Sarducci movie written by Don Novello, a spoof of &quot;1984&quot; called &quot;1985&quot; that was set in the future and written by Al Franken, Tom Davis, and Jim Downey, and an adaptation of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; Michaels himself was co-writing with friend John Head. The only movie to be produced from Michaels&#x27;s MGM deal was &quot;Nothing Lasts Forever&quot;, a black-and-white surreal sci-fi comedy written and directed by longtime resident &quot;SNL&quot; filmmaker Tom Schiller. The movie featured appearances from Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, but the studio opted to never release it.

In 1979, Michaels founded the production company Broadway Video, which has produced &quot;SNL&quot; since 1981 as well as other shows such as Canadian sketch-comedy&quot; The Kids in the Hall&quot; which began airing in 1988 on CBC in Canada, debuting in the U.S. market in 1989 on cable television network HBO until moving to CBS in 1993.

Whilst on his &quot;SNL&quot; hiatus, Michaels created another sketch show titled &quot;The New Show&quot;, which debuted on Friday nights in prime time on NBC in January 1984. The show failed to garner the same enthusiasm as &quot;SNL&quot; and was cancelled after 9 episodes.

In the 1980s, Michaels appeared in an HBO mockumentary titled &quot;The Canadian Conspiracy&quot; about the supposed subversion of the United States by Canadian-born media personalities, with Lorne Greene as the leader of the conspiracy. Michaels was identified as the anointed successor to Greene.

Michaels is also the executive producer of the NBC show &quot;Late Night,&quot; and was the executive producer of &quot;30 Rock&quot; and &quot;Up All Night&quot; during their runs.

On April 3, 2013, it was announced that Michaels would be taking over as the executive producer for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Consequently, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; moved to New York in early 2014 as &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;.

==Personal life==
Michaels has three children, Henry, Eddie, and Sophie and has been married three times. During the early 1960s, he began a relationship with Rosie Shuster, daughter of his comedy mentor Frank Shuster of the Wayne and Shuster comedy team, who later worked with him on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a writer. Michaels and Shuster were married in 1967 and divorced in 1980. He married model Susan Forristal in 1981, a marriage that ended in divorce in 1987. Michaels is married to Alice Barry, his former assistant. The pair wed in 1991. 

Michaels became a U.S. citizen in 1987 and was inducted into the Order of Canada in 2002.

In 2025, Michaels donated his archives to the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The Lorne Michaels Collection is scheduled to become available for research in January 2026.

==In popular culture==
In The Kids in the Hall movie &quot;Brain Candy&quot;, the character of Don Roritor was based heavily on actor Mark McKinney’s impersonation of Lorne Michaels.

The character Dr. Evil, the antagonist of Austin Powers in three films, has mannerisms and a speaking style based on Lorne Michaels. Dr. Evil was created and portrayed by &quot;SNL&quot; alumnus Mike Myers, who was at least partially influenced by fellow &quot;SNL&quot; performer Dana Carvey&#x27;s impression of Michaels.

In a 2008 interview with &quot;Playboy&quot;, as well in various other interviews, Tina Fey admitted that Alec Baldwin&#x27;s character Jack Donaghy on &quot;30 Rock&quot; is inspired by Michaels. In a different interview, on NPR&#x27;s radio show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;, Baldwin stated that some of his inspiration for Donaghy was drawn from Michaels.

Gabriel LaBelle plays Michaels in the 2024 film &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, a dramatization of behind-the-scenes events leading up to the first episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

==Honors==

In 1999, Michaels was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame and was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Also in 1999, Michaels received an honorary degree from Ryerson University.

In 2003, he received a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

In 2004, he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor by the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Speaking at the awards ceremony, original &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member Dan Aykroyd described the show as &quot;the primary satirical voice of the country&quot;.

Michaels received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement in 2006, Canada&#x27;s highest honor in the performing arts.

In 2008, Michaels was awarded the Webby for Film &amp; Video Lifetime Achievement. With the allotted five words allowed to each recipient, his acceptance speech was &quot;Five words is not enough&quot;.

In 2012, Michaels was awarded a rare Personal Peabody Award. He accepted at a ceremony in New York City at the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel.

In December 2021, Michaels was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors, along with Justino Diaz, Berry Gordy, Bette Midler, and Joni Mitchell.

In 2022, Michaels received a Peabody Award for his work as an executive producer of the Spanish-language comedy series &quot;Los Espookys&quot;. He was nominated for a second Peabody Award for his work producing &quot;Documentary Now!&quot;.

<text>The River Bure is a river in the county of Norfolk, England, most of it in the Broads. The Bure rises near Melton Constable, upstream of Aylsham, which was the original head of navigation. Nowadays, the head of navigation is downstream at Coltishall Bridge.
After Aylsham Lock and Burgh Bridge, the Bure passes through Buxton Lammas, Coltishall, Belaugh, Wroxham, Horning, past St. Benet&#x27;s Abbey, through Oby, Acle, Stokesby, along the northern border of the Halvergate Marshes, through Runham and Great Yarmouth where it meets Breydon Water and flows into the sea at Gorleston.

It has two major tributaries, the River Thurne and the River Ant. There is also Muck Fleet which connects the Trinity Broads (Ormesby, Rollesby and Filby Broad) to the main network. Other minor tributaries include the River Hor, which joins the Bure just upstream of Hoveton, The Mermaid which merges at Burgh-next-Aylsham and Scarrow Beck which meets the main river close to the village of Ingworth.

==History==
The River Bure has been navigable for some as far as Horstead Mill, near Coltishall, since at least 1685, when cargoes of coal, corn and timber were carried to within of Meyton Manor House. It was stated at the time that the river could be improved to enable boats to reach the house. Vessels could not travel beyond Coltishall, and so Aylsham was served by carts, either loaded from wherries at Coltishall and carried north, or loaded from boats at Cromer and carried south.

Plans to extend the limit of navigation were drawn up in 1773. An Act of Parliament was obtained on 7 April 1773, authorising improvements from Coltishall to Aylsham, which John Adey estimated would cost £6,000. Some £1,500 had already been raised or promised, and the balance was to be funded by subscriptions. Adey acted as clerk to the Bure Commissioners, while John Smith was appointed as engineer. Work began on 29 June 1774, and the lock and cut at Coltishall were completed by 16 March 1775, when the first boat used the lock. Progress after that was slow, for in October 1777 Smith announced that he had spent £3,600 so far, but estimated that a further £2,951 would be required to complete the work. It appears that the money had run out, but Smith was persuaded to carry on after 18 traders and landowners provided loans of between £50 and £150. John Green of Wroxham was appointed as joint engineer in March 1779, and the new waterway finally opened in October 1779.

Five locks were provided, at Aylsham, Burgh-near-Aylsham Mill, Oxnead Mill, Buxton Mill at Oxnead Lamas and Coltishall. Within a month, the Commissioners found that silting of the river bed had occurred, reducing the navigable depth, and dredging of the river bed using a scoop, known locally as a didle, was a regular activity. Small wherries, capable of carrying 13 tons, were used for the carriage of flour, agricultural produce, coal and timber. A brickyard at Oxnead was also served by the boats, while below Coltishall, marl was carried away from pits which were served by a system of navigable dikes on the estate of Horstead Hall. The marl trade continued until 1870, but the dikes remain, in an area called Little Switzerland.

At each of the mills, cuts were made to accommodate the locks, but at Aylsham a longer cut of about was made, ending at a basin where warehouses were constructed. Boats could also get from there to Aylsham Mill Pool, which enabled them to deliver grain and carry flour away. The navigation was reasonably successful until 1880, when railway competition arrived, in the form of the East Norfolk Railway, which followed the Bure valley. The East Norfolk later became part of the Great Eastern Railway. Further competition arrived in 1883, when the Eastern and Midlands Railway opened a railway station near the terminal basin on its line from Melton Constable to North Walsham. Despite this, wherries were using the navigation until 1912, when a disastrous flood damaged the locks. Assessment of the damage suggested that repairs would cost £4,500, which the Commissioners could not find, and so the navigation was abandoned. This act was formalised in 1928, when it was officially abandoned. Oxnead Lamas Lock was filled in, in 1933, but the other structures remain, although the lock gates have been replaced by sluices.

<text>In computing, a system call (commonly abbreviated to syscall) is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the operating system on which it is executed. This may include hardware-related services (for example, accessing a hard disk drive or accessing the device&#x27;s camera), creation and execution of new processes, and communication with integral kernel services such as process scheduling. System calls provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system.

In most systems, system calls can only be made from userspace processes, while in some systems, OS/360 and successors for example, privileged system code also issues system calls.

For embedded systems, system calls typically do not change the privilege mode of the CPU.

== Privileges ==
The architecture of most modern processors, with the exception of some embedded systems, involves a security model. For example, the &quot;rings&quot; model specifies multiple privilege levels under which software may be executed: a program is usually limited to its own address space so that it cannot access or modify other running programs or the operating system itself, and is usually prevented from directly manipulating hardware devices (e.g. the frame buffer or network devices).

However, many applications need access to these components, so system calls are made available by the operating system to provide well-defined, safe implementations for such operations. The operating system executes at the highest level of privilege, and allows applications to request services via system calls, which are often initiated via interrupts. An interrupt automatically puts the CPU into some elevated privilege level and then passes control to the kernel, which determines whether the calling program should be granted the requested service. If the service is granted, the kernel executes a specific set of instructions over which the calling program has no direct control, returns the privilege level to that of the calling program, and then returns control to the calling program.

== The library as an intermediary ==
Generally, systems provide a library or API that sits between normal programs and the operating system. On Unix-like systems, that API is usually part of an implementation of the C library (libc), such as glibc, that provides wrapper functions for the system calls, often named the same as the system calls they invoke. On Windows NT, that API is part of the Native API, in the library; this is an undocumented API used by implementations of the regular Windows API and directly used by some system programs on Windows. The library&#x27;s wrapper functions expose an ordinary function calling convention (a subroutine call on the assembly level) for using the system call, as well as making the system call more modular. Here, the primary function of the wrapper is to place all the arguments to be passed to the system call in the appropriate processor registers (and maybe on the call stack as well), and also setting a unique system call number for the kernel to call. In this way the library, which exists between the OS and the application, increases portability.

The call to the library function itself does not cause a switch to kernel mode and is usually a normal subroutine call (using, for example, a &quot;CALL&quot; assembly instruction in some Instruction set architectures (ISAs)). The actual system call does transfer control to the kernel (and is more implementation-dependent and platform-dependent than the library call abstracting it). For example, in Unix-like systems, codice_1 and codice_2 are C library functions that in turn execute instructions that invoke the codice_1 and codice_4 system calls. Making the system call directly in the application code is more complicated and may require embedded assembly code to be used (in C and C++), as well as requiring knowledge of the low-level binary interface for the system call operation, which may be subject to change over time and thus not be part of the application binary interface; the library functions are meant to abstract this away.

On exokernel based systems, the library is especially important as an intermediary. On exokernels, libraries shield user applications from the very low level kernel API, and provide abstractions and resource management.

IBM&#x27;s OS/360, DOS/360 and TSS/360 implement most system calls through a library of assembly language macros, although there are a few services with a call linkage. This reflects their origin at a time when programming in assembly language was more common than high-level language usage. IBM system calls were therefore not directly executable by high-level language programs, but required a callable assembly language wrapper subroutine. Since then, IBM has added many services that can be called from high level languages in, e.g., z/OS and z/VSE. In more recent release of MVS/SP and in all later MVS versions, some system call macros generate Program Call (PC).

== Examples and tools ==
On Unix, Unix-like and other POSIX-compliant operating systems, popular system calls are codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, and codice_13. Many modern operating systems have hundreds of system calls. For example, Linux and OpenBSD each have over 300 different calls, NetBSD has close to 500, FreeBSD has over 500, Windows has close to 2000, divided between win32k (graphical) and ntdll (core) system calls while Plan 9 has 54.

Tools such as strace, ftrace and truss allow a process to execute from start and report all system calls the process invokes, or can attach to an already running process and intercept any system call made by the said process if the operation does not violate the permissions of the user. This special ability of the program is usually also implemented with system calls such as ptrace or system calls on files in procfs.

== Typical implementations ==
Implementing system calls requires a transfer of control from user space to kernel space, which involves some sort of architecture-specific feature. A typical way to implement this is to use a software interrupt or trap. Interrupts transfer control to the operating system kernel, so software simply needs to set up some register with the system call number needed, and execute the software interrupt.

This is the only technique provided for many RISC processors, but CISC architectures such as x86 support additional techniques. For example, the x86 instruction set contains the instructions codice_14/codice_15 and codice_16/codice_17 (these two mechanisms were independently created by AMD and Intel, respectively, but in essence they do the same thing). These are &quot;fast&quot; control transfer instructions that are designed to quickly transfer control to the kernel for a system call without the overhead of an interrupt. Linux 2.5 began using this on the x86, where available; formerly it used the codice_18 instruction, where the system call number was placed in the codice_19 register before interrupt 0x80 was executed.

An older mechanism is the call gate; originally used in Multics and later, for example, see call gate on the Intel x86. It allows a program to call a kernel function directly using a safe control transfer mechanism, which the operating system sets up in advance. This approach has been unpopular on x86, presumably due to the requirement of a far call (a call to a procedure located in a different segment than the current code segment) which uses x86 memory segmentation and the resulting lack of portability it causes, and the existence of the faster instructions mentioned above.

For IA-64 architecture, codice_20 (Enter Privileged Code) instruction is used. The first eight system call arguments are passed in registers, and the rest are passed on the stack.

In the IBM System/360 mainframe family, and its successors, a Supervisor Call instruction (), with the number in the instruction rather than in a register, implements a system call for legacy facilities in most of IBM&#x27;s own operating systems, and for all system calls in Linux. In later versions of MVS, IBM uses the Program Call (PC) instruction for many newer facilities. In particular, PC is used when the caller might be in Service Request Block (SRB) mode.
The PDP-11 minicomputer used the , and instructions, which, similar to the IBM System/360 and x86 , put the code in the instruction; they generate interrupts to specific addresses, transferring control to the operating system. The VAX 32-bit successor to the PDP-11 series used the , , and instructions to make system calls to privileged code at various levels; the code is an argument to the instruction.

==Categories of system calls==
System calls can be grouped roughly into six major categories:

# Process control
#* create process (for example, codice_21 on Unix-like systems, or codice_22 in the Windows NT Native API)
#*terminate process
#*load, execute
#* get/set process attributes
#*wait for time, wait event, signal event
#*allocate and free memory
# File management
#* create file, delete file
#* open, close
#* read, write, reposition
#* get/set file attributes
# Device management
#* request device, release device
#* read, write, reposition
#* get/set device attributes
#* logically attach or detach devices
# Information maintenance
#* get/set total system information (including time, date, computer name, enterprise etc.)
#* get/set process, file, or device metadata (including author, opener, creation time and date, etc.)
# Communication
#* create, delete communication connection
#* send, receive messages
#* transfer status information
#* attach or detach remote devices
#Protection
#*get/set file permissions

== Processor mode and context switching ==
System calls in most Unix-like systems are processed in kernel mode, which is accomplished by changing the processor execution mode to a more privileged one, but no &quot;process&quot; context switch is necessary although a &quot;privilege&quot; context switch does occur. The hardware sees the world in terms of the execution mode according to the processor status register, and processes are an abstraction provided by the operating system. A system call does not generally require a context switch to another process; instead, it is processed in the context of whichever process invoked it.

In a multithreaded process, system calls can be made from multiple threads. The handling of such calls is dependent on the design of the specific operating system kernel and the application runtime environment. The following list shows typical models followed by operating systems:

* &quot;Many-to-one&quot; model: All system calls from any user thread in a process are handled by a single kernel-level thread. This model has a serious drawback any blocking system call (like awaiting input from the user) can freeze all the other threads. Also, since only one thread can access the kernel at a time, this model cannot utilize multiple cores of processors.
* &quot;One-to-one&quot; model: Every user thread gets attached to a distinct kernel-level thread during a system call. This model solves the above problem of blocking system calls. It is found in all major Linux distributions, macOS, iOS, recent Windows and Solaris versions.
* &quot;Many-to-many&quot; model: In this model, a pool of user threads is mapped to a pool of kernel threads. All system calls from a user thread pool are handled by the threads in their corresponding kernel thread pool.
* &quot;Hybrid&quot; model: This model implements both many to many and one to one models depending upon the choice made by the kernel. This is found in old versions of IRIX, HP-UX and Solaris.

<text>Stephen Glenn Martin (born August 14, 1945) is an American comedian, actor, writer, producer, and musician. Known for his work in comedy films, television, and recording, he has received many accolades, including five Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Honorary Academy Award, in addition to nominations for two Tony Awards. He also received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2005, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2007, and an AFI Life Achievement Award in 2015. In 2004, Comedy Central ranked Martin at sixth place in a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics. &quot;The Guardian&quot; named him one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.

Martin first came to public notice as a writer for &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, for which he won a Primetime Emmy Award in 1969, and later as a frequent host on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. He became one of the most popular American stand-up comedians during the 1970s, performing his brand of offbeat, absurdist comedy routines before sold-out theaters on national tours. He then starred in films such as &quot;The Jerk&quot; (1979), &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid&quot; (1982), &quot;The Man with Two Brains&quot; (1983), &quot;All of Me&quot; (1984), &quot;¡Three Amigos!&quot; (1986), &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot; (1987), &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; (1988), &quot;L.A. Story&quot; (1991), &quot;Bowfinger&quot; (1999) and &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; (2003). He played family patriarchs in &quot;Parenthood&quot; (1989), the &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; films (1991–1995), &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; (2003), and the &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; films (2003–2005).

Since 2015, Martin has embarked on several national comedy tours with fellow comedian Martin Short. In 2018, they released their Netflix special &quot;An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life&quot; which received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations. In 2021, he co-created and starred in his first television show, the Hulu comedy series &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot;, alongside Short and Selena Gomez, for which he earned three Primetime Emmy Award nominations, two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, a Golden Globe Award nomination, and a 2021 Peabody Award nomination. In 2022, Martin and Short co-hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; together with Gomez making an appearance.

Martin is also known for writing the books to the musical &quot;Bright Star&quot; (2016) and to the comedy &quot;Meteor Shower&quot; (2017), both of which premiered on Broadway; he co-wrote the music to the former. Martin has played banjo since an early age and has included music in his comedy routines from the beginning of his professional career. He has released several music albums and has performed with various bluegrass acts, including Earl Scruggs. He has won three Grammy Awards for his music.

==Early life and education==

Stephen Glenn Martin was born on August 14, 1945, in Waco, Texas, the son of Mary Lee (née Stewart; 1911–2002) and Glenn Vernon Martin (1914–1997), a real estate salesman and aspiring actor. He has an older sister, Melinda.

Martin is of English, Scottish, Welsh, Scots-Irish, German, and French descent. He and his sister grew up in a Baptist family in Inglewood, California, and later in Garden Grove in Orange County; he was a cheerleader at Garden Grove High School. One of Martin&#x27;s earliest memories is seeing his father as an extra serving drinks onstage at the Callboard Theater on Melrose Place in West Hollywood. During World War II in Britain, his father appeared in a production of &quot;Our Town&quot; with Raymond Massey. Expressing his affection through gifts like cars and bikes, Steve&#x27;s father was stern and not emotionally open to his son. He was proud but critical, with Steve later recalling that in his teens his feelings for his father were mostly of hatred.

Steve Martin&#x27;s first job was at newly opened Disneyland, selling guidebooks on weekends and full-time during summer break. The work lasted for three years (1955–1958). During his free time, he frequented the Main Street Magic shop, where tricks were demonstrated to patrons. While working at Disneyland, he was captured in the background of the home movie that was made into the short-subject film &quot;Disneyland Dream&quot;, incidentally becoming his first film appearance. By 1960, he had mastered several magic tricks and illusions and took a paying job at the Magic shop in Fantasyland in August. There he perfected his talents for magic, juggling, and creating balloon animals in the manner of mentor Wally Boag, frequently performing for tips.

In his authorized biography, close friend Morris Walker suggests that Martin could &quot;be described most accurately as an agnostic ... he rarely went to church and was never involved in organized religion of his own volition&quot;. In his early 20s, Martin dated Melissa Trumbo, daughter of novelist and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo.

After high school, Martin attended Santa Ana College, taking classes in drama and English poetry. In his free time, he teamed up with friend and high school classmate Kathy Westmoreland to participate in comedies and other productions at the Bird Cage Theatre. He joined a comedy troupe at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm. Later, he met budding actress Stormie Sherk, and they developed comedy routines and became romantically involved. Sherk&#x27;s influence led Martin to apply to the California State University, Long Beach, for enrollment with a major in philosophy. Sherk enrolled at UCLA, about an hour&#x27;s drive north, and the distance eventually caused them to lead separate lives.

Inspired by his philosophy classes, Martin considered becoming a professor instead of an actor-comedian. Being at college changed his life. Martin recalls reading a treatise on comedy that led him to think: Martin periodically spoofed his philosophy studies in his 1970s stand-up act, comparing philosophy with studying geology. 

In 1967, Martin transferred to UCLA and switched his major to theater. While attending college, he appeared in an episode of &quot;The Dating Game&quot;, winning a date with Deana Martin. Martin began working local clubs at night, to mixed notices, and at twenty-one, he dropped out of college.

==Career==

===Stand-up comedy ===
==== Late night ====
In 1967, his former girlfriend Nina Goldblatt, a dancer on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, helped Martin land a writing job with the show by submitting his work to head writer Mason Williams. Williams initially paid Martin out of his own pocket. Along with the other writers for the show, Martin won an Emmy Award in 1969 at the age of twenty-three. He wrote for &quot;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour&quot; and &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour.&quot; Martin&#x27;s first national television appearance was on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; in 1968. He says: During these years his roommates included Gary Mule Deer and Michael Johnson. Gary Mule Deer supplied the first joke Martin submitted to Tommy Smothers for use on the &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; show. Martin opened for groups such as The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (who returned the favor by appearing in his 1980 television special &quot;All Commercials&quot;), The Carpenters, and Toto. He appeared at The Boarding House, among other venues. He continued to write, earning an Emmy nomination for his work on &quot;Van Dyke and Company&quot; in 1976.
In the mid-1970s, Martin made frequent appearances as a stand-up comedian on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, and on &quot;The Gong Show&quot;, HBO&#x27;s &quot;On Location&quot;, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;). &quot;SNL&quot; audience jumped by a million viewers when he made guest appearances, and he was one of the show&#x27;s most successful hosts. Martin has appeared on twenty-seven &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; shows and guest-hosted sixteen times, second only to Alec Baldwin, who has hosted seventeen times . On the show, Martin popularized the air quotes gesture. While on the show, Martin grew close to several cast members, including Gilda Radner. On the night she died of ovarian cancer, a visibly shaken Martin hosted &quot;SNL&quot; and featured footage of himself and Radner together in a 1978 sketch.

==== Comedy albums ====

In the 1970s, his television appearances led to the release of comedy albums that went platinum. The track &quot;Excuse Me&quot; on his first album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Small&quot; (1977), helped establish a national catch phrase. His next album, &quot;A Wild and Crazy Guy&quot; (1978), was an even bigger success, reaching the No. 2 spot on the U.S. sales chart, selling over a million copies. &quot;Just a wild and crazy guy&quot; became another of Martin&#x27;s known catchphrases. The album featured a character based on a series of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketches in which Martin and Dan Aykroyd played the Festrunk Brothers; Yortuk and Georgi were bumbling Czechoslovak would-be playboys. The album ends with the song &quot;King Tut&quot;, written and sung by Martin and backed by the &quot;Toot Uncommons&quot;, members of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. It was later released as a single, reaching No. 17 on the U.S. charts in 1978 and selling over a million copies. The song came out during the King Tut craze that accompanied the popular traveling exhibit of the Egyptian king&#x27;s tomb artifacts. Both albums won Grammys for Best Comedy Recording in 1977 and 1978, respectively. Martin performed &quot;King Tut&quot; on the April 22, 1978, &quot;SNL&quot; program.

Decades later, in 2012, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; described Martin&#x27;s unique style and its effect on audiences:
On his comedy albums, Martin&#x27;s stand-up is self-referential and sometimes self-mocking. It mixes philosophical riffs with sudden spurts of &quot;happy feet&quot;, banjo playing with balloon depictions of concepts like venereal disease, and the &quot;controversial&quot; kitten juggling (he is a master juggler; the &quot;kittens&quot; were stuffed animal toys). His style is off-kilter and ironic and sometimes pokes fun at stand-up comedy traditions, such as Martin opening his act (from &quot;A Wild and Crazy Guy&quot;) by saying: Or: &quot;Hello, I&#x27;m Steve Martin, and I&#x27;ll be out here in a minute.&quot; In one comedy routine, used on the &quot;Comedy Is Not Pretty!&quot; album, Martin claimed that his real name was &quot;Gern Blanston&quot;. The riff took on a life of its own. There is a Gern Blanston website, and for a time a rock band took the moniker as its name.

Martin&#x27;s show soon required full-sized stadiums for the audiences he was drawing. Concerned about his visibility in venues on such a scale, Martin began to wear a distinctive three-piece white suit that became a trademark for his act. Martin stopped doing stand-up comedy in 1981 to concentrate on movies and did not return for thirty-five years. About the decision, he said, &quot;My act was conceptual. Once the concept was stated, and everybody understood it, it was done... It was about coming to the end of the road. There was no way to live on in that persona. I had to take that fabulous luck of not being remembered as that, exclusively. You know, I didn&#x27;t announce that I was stopping. I just stopped.&quot;

==== Return to standup ====
In 2016, Martin made a low-key comeback to live comedy, opening for Jerry Seinfeld. He performed a ten-minute stand-up routine before turning the stage over to Seinfeld. Also in 2016 he staged a national tour with Martin Short and the Steep Canyon Rangers, which yielded a 2018 Netflix comedy special, &quot;Steve Martin and Martin Short: An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life&quot;. The special received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations with Martin receiving two nominations for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special and Outstanding Music and Lyrics for &quot;The Buddy Song&quot;.

=== Acting career===
==== 1970s ====
By the end of the 1970s, Martin had acquired the kind of following normally reserved for rock stars, with his tour appearances typically occurring at sold-out arenas filled with tens of thousands of screaming fans. But unknown to his audience, stand-up comedy was &quot;just an accident&quot; for him; his real goal was to get into film.

Martin had a small role in the 1972 film &quot;Another Nice Mess&quot;. In 1974, he starred in the Canadian travelogue production &quot;The Funnier Side of Eastern Canada&quot;, created to promote tourism in Montreal and Toronto, which also included standup segments filmed at the Ice House in Pasadena, California. His first substantial film appearance was in a short titled &quot;The Absent-Minded Waiter&quot; (1977). The seven-minute-long film, also featuring Buck Henry and Teri Garr, was written by and starred Martin. The film was nominated for an Academy Award as &quot;Best Short Film, Live Action&quot;. He made his first substantial feature film appearance in the musical &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, where he sang The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s Silver Hammer&quot;.

In 1979, Martin starred in the comedy film &quot;The Jerk&quot;, directed by Carl Reiner, and written by Martin, Michael Elias, and Carl Gottlieb. The film was a huge success, grossing over $100 million on a budget of approximately $4 million.

Stanley Kubrick met with him to discuss the possibility of Martin starring in a screwball comedy version of &quot;Traumnovelle&quot; (Kubrick later changed his approach to the material, the result of which was 1999&#x27;s &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;). Martin was executive producer for &quot;Domestic Life&quot;, a prime-time television series starring friend Martin Mull, and a late-night series called &quot;Twilight Theater&quot;. It emboldened Martin to try his hand at his first serious film, &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; (1981), based on the 1978 BBC serial by Dennis Potter. He was anxious to perform in the movie because of his desire to avoid being typecast. To prepare for that film, Martin took acting lessons from director Herbert Ross and spent months learning how to tap dance. The film was a financial failure; Martin&#x27;s comment at the time was &quot;I don&#x27;t know what to blame, other than it&#x27;s me and not a comedy.&quot;

==== 1980s ====
Martin was in three more Reiner-directed comedies after &quot;The Jerk&quot;: &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid&quot; in 1982, &quot;The Man with Two Brains&quot; in 1983 and &quot;All of Me&quot; in 1984, his most critically acclaimed performance up to that point. Martin was by now requesting almost $3 million per film, but &quot;Plaid&quot; and &quot;Two Brains&quot; both failed at the box office like &quot;Pennies&quot;, endangering his young career. In 1986, Martin joined fellow &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; veterans Martin Short and Chevy Chase in &quot;¡Three Amigos!&quot;, directed by John Landis, and written by Martin, Lorne Michaels, and singer-songwriter Randy Newman. It was originally entitled &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; and Martin was to be teamed with Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. In 1986, Martin was in the movie musical film version of the hit Off-Broadway play &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (based on a famous B-movie), playing the sadistic dentist, Orin Scrivello. The film was the first of three films teaming Martin with Rick Moranis. In 1987, Martin joined comedian John Candy in the John Hughes movie &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles.&quot; That same year, Martin starred in &quot;Roxanne&quot;, the film adaptation of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, which he co-wrote and won him a Writers Guild of America Award. It also garnered recognition from Hollywood and the public that he was more than a comedian. In 1988, he performed in the Frank Oz film &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot;, a remake of &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, alongside Michael Caine. Also in 1988, he appeared at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center in a revival of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; directed by Mike Nichols. He played Vladimir, with Robin Williams as Estragon and Bill Irwin as Lucky. Martin starred in the Ron Howard film &quot;Parenthood&quot; with Rick Moranis in 1989.

==== 1990s ====
He later re-teamed with Moranis in the Mafia comedy &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot; (1990). In 1991, Martin starred in and wrote &quot;L.A. Story&quot;, a romantic comedy, in which the female lead was played by his then-wife Victoria Tennant. Martin also appeared in Lawrence Kasdan&#x27;s &quot;Grand Canyon&quot;, in which he played the tightly wound Hollywood film producer, Davis, who was recovering from a traumatic robbery that left him injured, which was a more serious role for him. Martin also starred in a remake of the comedy &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; in 1991 (followed by a sequel in 1995) and in the 1992 comedy &quot;Housesitter&quot;, with Goldie Hawn and Dana Delany. In 1994, he starred in &quot;A Simple Twist of Fate&quot;; a film adaptation of &quot;Silas Marner&quot;.

In David Mamet&#x27;s 1997 thriller &quot;The Spanish Prisoner&quot;, Martin played a darker role as a wealthy stranger who takes a suspicious interest in the work of a young businessman (Campbell Scott). In 1998, Martin guest starred with U2 in the 200th episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; titled &quot;Trash of the Titans&quot;, providing the voice for sanitation commissioner Ray Patterson, and also voiced Hotep in the animated film &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;. 

In 1999, Martin and Hawn starred in a remake of the 1970 Neil Simon comedy, &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot;, and Martin went on to star with Eddie Murphy in the comedy &quot;Bowfinger,&quot; which he also wrote. He also appeared in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; to introduce the segment &quot;Pines of Rome&quot;, along with Itzhak Perlman. 

==== 2000s ====
By 2003, Martin ranked fourth on the box office stars list, after starring in &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; (2003) and &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; (2003), each of which earned over $130 million at U.S. theaters. That same year, he also played the villainous Mr. Chairman in the animation/live action blend, &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;. In 2005, Martin wrote and starred in &quot;Shopgirl&quot;, based on his own novella (2000), and starred in &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen 2&quot;. In 2006, he starred in the box office hit &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, as the bumbling Inspector Clouseau. He reprised the role in 2009&#x27;s &quot;The Pink Panther 2&quot;. When combined, the two films grossed over $230 million at the box office.

In the comedy &quot;Baby Mama&quot; (2008), starring Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, Martin played the founder of a health food company. Martin also appeared as a guest star in &quot;30 Rock&quot; as Gavin Volure in the episode Gavin Volure. He was nominated for an Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. The following year he starred in Nancy Meyers&#x27; romantic comedy &quot;It&#x27;s Complicated&quot; (2009), opposite Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin. In 2009, an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; listed Martin as one of the best actors never to receive an Oscar nomination.

==== 2010s ====

During the 2010s, Martin sparsely appeared in film and television. In 2011, he appeared with Jack Black, Owen Wilson, and JoBeth Williams in the birdwatching comedy &quot;The Big Year&quot; directed by David Frankel. The film was criticized for its lightweight story and was a box office bomb. After a three-year hiatus, Martin returned in 2015 when he voiced a role in the DreamWorks animated film &quot;Home&quot; alongside Jim Parsons and Rihanna. The film received mixed critical reception but was a financial success. In 2016, he played a supporting role in Ang Lee&#x27;s war drama &quot;Billy Lynn&#x27;s Long Halftime Walk&quot;. He also appeared as himself in Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s Netflix series &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot; in 2016. He also appeared in the taped version of &quot;Oh, Hello on Broadway&quot; (2017) as the guest. He also starred in the Netflix comedy special &quot;An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life&quot; with Martin Short in 2018.

==== 2020s ====
In 2020, Martin reprised his role as George Banks in the short &quot;Father of the Bride, Part 3(ish)&quot;. Martin is an executive producer of &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot;, a Hulu comedy series in which he stars with Martin Short and Selena Gomez, and which he created alongside John Hoffman. In August 2022, Martin revealed that the series will likely be his final role, as he does not intend to seek out roles or cameos for other shows or films once the series ends.

===Writing===
==== Books====
Martin&#x27;s first book was &quot;Cruel Shoes&quot;, a collection of comedic short stories and essays. It was published in 1979 by G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons after a limited release of a truncated version in 1977.

Throughout the 1990s, Martin wrote various pieces for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. In 2002, he adapted the Carl Sternheim play &quot;The Underpants&quot;, which ran Off Broadway at Classic Stage Company, and in 2008 co-wrote and produced &quot;Traitor&quot;, starring Don Cheadle. He has also written the novellas &quot;Shopgirl&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Pleasure of My Company&quot; (2003), both more wry in tone than raucous. A story of a 28-year-old woman behind the glove counter at the Saks Fifth Avenue department store in Beverly Hills, &quot;Shopgirl&quot; was made into a film starring Martin and Claire Danes. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2005 and was featured at the Chicago International Film Festival and the Austin Film Festival before going into limited release in the US. In 2007, he published a memoir, &quot;Born Standing Up&quot;, which &quot;Time&quot; magazine named as one of the Top 10 Nonfiction Books of 2007, ranking it at 6, and praising it as &quot;a funny, moving, surprisingly frank memoir.&quot; In 2010, he published the novel &quot;An Object of Beauty.&quot;

Beginning in 2019, Martin has collaborated with cartoonist Harry Bliss as a writer for the syndicated single-panel comic &quot;Bliss&quot;. Together, they published the cartoon collection &quot;A Wealth of Pigeons&quot;. In 2022, they collaborated again for Martin&#x27;s illustrated autobiography, &quot;Number One is Walking&quot;.

==== Plays ====

In 1993, Martin wrote his first full-length play, &quot;Picasso at the Lapin Agile&quot;. The first reading of the play took place in Beverly Hills, California at his home, with Tom Hanks reading the role of Pablo Picasso and Chris Sarandon reading the role of Albert Einstein. Following this, the play opened at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago, and played from October 1993 to May 1994, then went on to run successfully in Los Angeles, New York City, and several other US cities. In 2009, the school board in La Grande, Oregon, refused to allow the play to be performed after several parents complained about the content. In an open letter in the local &quot;Observer&quot; newspaper, Martin wrote: 

==== Broadway ====
Inspired by &quot;Love has Come for You&quot;, Martin and Edie Brickell collaborated on his first musical, &quot;Bright Star&quot;. It is set in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina in 1945–46, with flashbacks to 1923. The musical debuted on Broadway on March 24, 2016. Charles Isherwood of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised its score by Martin and Brickell writing, &quot;The shining achievement of the musical is its winsome country and bluegrass score, with music by Mr. Martin and Ms. Brickell, and lyrics by Ms. Brickell...the songs — yearning ballads and square-dance romps rich with fiddle, piano, and banjo, beautifully played by a nine-person band — provide a buoyancy that keeps the momentum from stalling.&quot; The musical went on to receive five Tony Award nominations including Best Musical. Martin himself received Tony nominations for Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score and received the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Music and the Outstanding Critics Circle Award for Best New Score. He also received a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album.

Martin&#x27;s next work as a playwright was the comic play &quot;Meteor Shower&quot; which opened at San Diego&#x27;s Old Globe Theatre in August 2016, and went on to Connecticut&#x27;s Long Wharf Theatre later the same year. The play opened on Broadway at the Booth Theater on November 29, 2017. The cast features Amy Schumer, Laura Benanti, Jeremy Shamos and Keegan-Michael Key, with direction by Jerry Zaks. Critic Allison Adaot of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Meteor Shower&quot; is a very funny play. Keening-like-a-howler-monkey funny. Design-a-new-cry-laughing-emoji funny...In the confident hands of writer and comedy maestro Steve Martin, the premise is polished to sparkling.&quot;

===Hosting===
Martin hosted the Academy Awards solo in 2001 and 2003, and with Alec Baldwin in 2010. In 2020, Martin opened the 92nd Academy Awards alongside Chris Rock with comedy material. They were not previously announced as that year&#x27;s hosts, and joked after their opening monolog, &quot;Well we&#x27;ve had a great time not hosting tonight&quot;.

In 2005, Martin co-hosted &quot;&quot;, marking the park&#x27;s anniversary. Disney continued to run the show until March 2009, which now plays in the lobby of &quot;Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln&quot;.

A fan of Monty Python, in 1989 Martin hosted the television special, &quot;Parrot Sketch Not Included – 20 Years of Monty Python&quot;.

===Music career===
====Banjo music====

Martin first picked up the banjo when he was around 17 years of age. Martin has stated in several interviews and in his memoir, &quot;Born Standing Up&quot;, that he used to take 33 rpm bluegrass records and slow them down to 16 rpm and tune his banjo down, so the notes would sound the same. Martin was able to pick out each note and perfect his playing. Martin learned how to play the banjo with help from John McEuen, who later joined the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. McEuen&#x27;s brother later managed Martin as well as the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Martin did his stand-up routine opening for the band in the early 1970s. He had the band play on his hit song &quot;King Tut&quot;, being credited as &quot;The Toot Uncommons&quot; (as in Tutankhamun). The banjo was a staple of Martin&#x27;s 1970s stand-up career, and he periodically poked fun at his love for the instrument. On the &quot;Comedy Is Not Pretty!&quot; album, he included an all-instrumental jam, titled &quot;Drop Thumb Medley&quot;, and played the track on his 1979 concert tour. His final comedy album, &quot;The Steve Martin Brothers&quot; (1981), featured one side of Martin&#x27;s typical stand-up material, with the other side featuring live performances of Steve playing banjo with a bluegrass band.

In 2001, he played banjo on Earl Scruggs&#x27;s remake of &quot;Foggy Mountain Breakdown&quot;. The recording was the winner of the Best Country Instrumental Performance category at the Grammy Awards of 2002. In 2008, Martin appeared with the band, In the Minds of the Living, during a show in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. In 2009, Martin released his first all-music album, &quot;The Crow: New Songs for the 5-String Banjo&quot; with appearances from stars such as Dolly Parton. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album in 2010. Nitty Gritty Dirt Band member John McEuen produced the album. Martin made his first appearance on The Grand Ole Opry on May 30, 2009. In the &quot;American Idol&quot; season eight finals, he performed alongside Michael Sarver and Megan Joy in the song &quot;Pretty Flowers&quot;. Martin is featured playing banjo on &quot;I Hate Love&quot; from Kelly Clarkson&#x27;s tenth studio album &quot;Chemistry &quot;. It was released as a promotional single on June 2, 2023.

Alison Brown co-wrote &quot;Foggy Morning Breaking&quot; with Martin in 2023, and &quot;Wall Guitar&quot; in 2024.

==== Steep Canyon Rangers ====
 In June 2009, Martin played banjo along with the Steep Canyon Rangers on &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; and began a two-month U.S. tour with the Rangers in September, including appearances at the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival, Carnegie Hall and Benaroya Hall in Seattle. In November, they went on to play at the Royal Festival Hall in London with support from Mary Black. In 2010, Steve Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers appeared at the New Orleans Jazzfest, Merlefest Bluegrass Festival in Wilkesboro, North Carolina, at Bonnaroo Music Festival, at the ROMP Bluegrass Festival in Owensboro, Kentucky, at the Red Butte Garden Concert series, and on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;. Martin performed &quot;Jubilation Day&quot; with the Steep Canyon Rangers on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on March 21, 2011, on &quot;Conan&quot; on May 3, 2011, and on BBC&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot; on July 6, 2011. Martin performed a song he wrote called &quot;Me and Paul Revere&quot; in addition to two other songs on the lawn of the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., at the &quot;Capitol Fourth Celebration&quot; on July 4, 2011. While on tour, Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers occasionally performed Martin&#x27;s 1978 novelty hit song &quot;King Tut&quot; live in a bluegrass arrangement. One of these performances was released on the 2011 album &quot;Rare Bird Alert&quot;. In 2011, Martin also narrated and appeared in the PBS documentary &quot;Give Me The Banjo&quot; chronicling the history of the banjo in America.

&quot;Love Has Come for You&quot;, a collaboration album with Edie Brickell, was released in April 2013. The two made musical guest appearances on talk shows, such as &quot;The View&quot; and &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, to promote the album.
The title track won the Grammy Award for Best American Roots Song.
Starting in May 2013, he began a tour with the Steep Canyon Rangers and Edie Brickell throughout the United States. In 2015, Brickell and Martin released &quot;So Familiar&quot; as the second installment of their partnership. In 2017, Martin and Brickell appeared in the multi-award-winning documentary film &quot;The American Epic Sessions&quot; directed by Bernard MacMahon. Recording live direct-to-disc on the first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s, they performed a version of &quot;The Coo Coo Bird&quot; a traditional song that Martin learned from the 1960s folk music group The Holy Modal Rounders. The song was featured on the film soundtrack, &quot;Music from The American Epic Sessions&quot; released on June 9, 2017.

In 2010, Martin created the Steve Martin Prize for Excellence in Banjo and Bluegrass, an award established to reward artistry and bring greater visibility to bluegrass performers. The prize includes a US$50,000 cash award, a bronze sculpture created by the artist Eric Fischl, and a chance to perform with Martin on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. Recipients include Noam Pikelny of the Punch Brothers band (2010), Sammy Shelor of Lonesome River Band (2011), Mark Johnson (2012), Jens Kruger (2013), Eddie Adcock (2014), Danny Barnes (2015), Rhiannon Giddens (2016), Scott Vestal (2017), Kristin Scott Benson (2018), and Victor Furtado (2019).

==Personal life==
At the beginning of his career in comedy, Martin dated writer and artist Eve Babitz, who suggested he dress in what became his trademark white suit. From 1977 to 1980, Martin was in a relationship with Bernadette Peters, with whom he co-starred in &quot;The Jerk&quot; and &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot;. He also dated Karen Carpenter, Mary Tyler Moore and Anne Heche, who wrote about their relationship in her memoir. On November 20, 1986, Martin married actress Victoria Tennant, with whom he co-starred in &quot;All of Me&quot; and &quot;L.A. Story&quot;. They divorced in 1994.

Martin went on a USO Tour to Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm from October 14 to 21, 1990. He met with military service men and women all over the region signing thousands of autographs and posing for pictures. &quot;Everybody coming out here, giving up part of their lives for this effort. I had some time off, and I felt kind of bad just sitting there,&quot; Martin said, &quot;so I came.&quot;

On July 28, 2007, Martin married writer and former &quot;New Yorker&quot; staff member Anne Stringfield. Bob Kerrey presided over the ceremony at Martin&#x27;s Los Angeles home. Lorne Michaels served as best man. The nuptials came as a surprise to several guests, who had been told they were coming for a party. In December 2012, Martin became a father when Stringfield gave birth to their daughter.

Martin has been an avid art collector since 1968, when he bought a print by Ed Ruscha. In 2001, the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art presented a five-month exhibit of twenty-eight items from Martin&#x27;s collection, including works by Roy Lichtenstein, Pablo Picasso, David Hockney, and Edward Hopper. In 2006, he sold Hopper&#x27;s &quot;Hotel Window&quot; (1955) at Sotheby&#x27;s for $26.8 million. In 2015, working with two other curators, he organized an exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and several other locations called, &quot;The Idea of North: The Paintings of Lawren Harris,&quot; featuring the works of Canadian painter and Group of Seven co-founder Lawren Harris.

In July 2004, Martin purchased what he believed to be &quot;Landschaft mit Pferden&quot; (&quot;Landscape with Horses&quot;), a 1915 work by Heinrich Campendonk, from a Paris gallery for approximately €700,000. Fifteen months later, he sold the painting at a Christie&#x27;s auction to a Swiss businesswoman for €500,000. The painting was later discovered to be a forgery. Police believe the fake Campendonk originated from a collection devised by a German forgery ring led by Wolfgang Beltracchi, pieces from which had been sold to French galleries. Martin only discovered the fact that the painting had been fake many years after it had been sold at the auction. Concerning the experience, Martin said that the Beltracchis &quot;were quite clever in that they gave it a long provenance and they faked labels, and it came out of a collection that mingled legitimate pictures with faked pictures.&quot;

Martin was on the Los Angeles County Museum of Art board of trustees from 1984 to 2004. Martin assisted in launching the National Endowment for Indigenous Visual Arts (NEIVA), a fund to support Australian Indigenous artists in 2021. Martin has supported Indigenous Australian painting previously. He organized an exhibition in 2019 with Gagosian Gallery titled &quot;Desert Painters of Australia&quot;, which featured art by George Tjungurrayi and Emily Kame Kngwarreye.

Martin has tinnitus; the condition was first attributed to filming a pistol shooting scene for &quot;Three Amigos&quot; in 1986, but Martin later clarified that the tinnitus was actually from years of listening to loud music and performing in front of noisy crowds.

==Influences==

Martin has said that his comedy influences include Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Jack Benny, Jerry Lewis, and Woody Allen.

On &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, he mentioned that Jerry Seinfeld is one of his &quot;retro heroes&quot;, &quot;a guy who came up behind me and is better than I am. I think he&#x27;s fantastic, I love to listen to him, he almost puts me at peace. I love to listen to him talk&quot;.

Martin&#x27;s offbeat, ironic, and deconstructive style of humor has influenced many comedians during his career including Tina Fey, Steve Carell, Conan O&#x27;Brien, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Robert Smigel, Bo Burnham, and Jordan Peele. Singer and composer Mike Patton cited Steve Martin as being an early influence saying that he identifies with Martin.

<text>In economics and business decision-making, a sunk cost (also known as retrospective cost) is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. Sunk costs are contrasted with &quot;prospective costs&quot;, which are future costs that may be avoided if action is taken. In other words, a sunk cost is a sum paid in the past that is no longer relevant to decisions about the future. Even though economists argue that sunk costs are no longer relevant to future rational decision-making, people in everyday life often take previous expenditures in situations, such as repairing a car or house, into their future decisions regarding those properties.

== Bygones principle ==

According to classical economics and standard microeconomic theory, only prospective (future) costs are relevant to a rational decision. At any moment in time, the best thing to do depends only on &quot;current&quot; alternatives. The only things that matter are the &quot;future&quot; consequences. Past mistakes are irrelevant. Any costs incurred prior to making the decision have already been incurred no matter what decision is made. They may be described as &quot;water under the bridge&quot;, and making decisions on their basis may be described as &quot;crying over spilt milk&quot;. In other words, people should not let sunk costs influence their decisions; sunk costs are irrelevant to rational decisions. Thus, if a new factory was originally projected to cost $100 million, and yield $120 million in value, and after $30 million is spent on it the value projection falls to $65 million, the company should abandon the project rather than spending an additional $70 million to complete it. Conversely, if the value projection falls to $75 million, the company, as a rational actor, should continue the project. This is known as the &quot;bygones principle&quot; or the &quot;marginal principle&quot;.

The bygones principle is grounded in the branch of normative decision theory known as &quot;rational choice theory&quot;, particularly in expected utility hypothesis. Expected utility theory relies on a property known as &quot;cancellation&quot;, which says that it is rational in decision-making to disregard (cancel) any state of the world that yields the same outcome regardless of one&#x27;s choice. Past decisions—including sunk costs—meet that criterion.

The bygones principle can also be formalised as the notion of &quot;separability&quot;. Separability requires agents to take decisions by comparing the available options in eventualities that can still occur, uninfluenced by how the current situation was reached or by eventualities that are precluded by that history. In the language of decision trees, it requires the agent&#x27;s choice at a particular choice node to be independent of unreachable parts of the tree. This formulation makes clear how central the principle is to standard economic theory by, for example, founding the folding-back algorithm for individual sequential decisions and game-theoretical concepts such as sub-game perfection.

Until a decision-maker irreversibly commits resources, the prospective cost is an avoidable future cost and is properly included in any decision-making process. For instance, if someone is considering pre-ordering movie tickets, but has not actually purchased them yet, the cost remains avoidable.

Both retrospective and prospective costs could be either fixed costs (continuous for as long as the business is operating and unaffected by output volume) or variable costs (dependent on volume). However, many economists consider it a mistake to classify sunk costs as &quot;fixed&quot; or &quot;variable&quot;. For example, if a firm sinks $400 million on an enterprise software installation, that cost is &quot;sunk&quot; because it was a one-time expense and cannot be recovered once spent. A &quot;fixed&quot; cost would be monthly payments made as part of a service contract or licensing deal with the company that set up the software. The upfront irretrievable payment for the installation should &quot;not&quot; be deemed a &quot;fixed&quot; cost, with its cost spread out over time. Sunk costs should be kept separate. The &quot;variable costs&quot; for this project might include data centre power usage, for example.

There are cases in which taking sunk costs into account in decision-making, violating the bygones principle, is rational. For example, for a manager who wishes to be perceived as persevering in the face of adversity, or to avoid blame for earlier mistakes, it may be rational to persist with a project for personal reasons even if it is not the benefit of their company. Or, if they hold private information about the undesirability of abandoning a project, it is fully rational to persist with a project that outsiders think displays the fallacy of sunk cost.

== Fallacy effect ==

The bygones principle does not always accord with real-world behavior. Sunk costs often influence people&#x27;s decisions, with people believing that investments (i.e., sunk costs) justify further expenditures. People demonstrate &quot;a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made&quot;. This is the sunk cost fallacy, and such behavior may be described as &quot;throwing good money after bad&quot;, while refusing to succumb to what may be described as &quot;cutting one&#x27;s losses&quot;. People can remain in failing relationships because they &quot;have already invested too much to leave&quot;. Other people are swayed by arguments that a war must continue because lives will have been sacrificed in vain unless victory is achieved. Individuals caught up in psychologically manipulative scams will continue investing time, money and emotional energy into the project, despite doubts or suspicions that something is not right. These types of behaviour do not seem to accord with rational choice theory and are often classified as behavioural errors.

Rego, Arantes, and Magalhães point out that the sunk cost effect exists in committed relationships. They devised two experiments, one of which showed that people in a relationship which they had invested money and effort in were more likely to keep that relationship going than end it; and in the second experiment, while people are in a relationship which they had invested enough time in, they tended to devote more time to the relationship. It also means people fall into the sunk cost fallacy. Although people should ignore sunk costs and make rational decisions when planning for the future, time, money, and effort often make people continue to maintain this relationship, which is equivalent to continuing to invest in failed projects.

According to evidence reported by De Bondt and Makhija (1988), managers of many utility companies in the United States have been overly reluctant to terminate economically unviable nuclear plant projects. In the 1960s, the nuclear power industry promised &quot;energy too cheap to meter&quot;. Nuclear power lost public support in the 1970s and 1980s, when public service commissions around the nation ordered prudency reviews. From these reviews, De Bondt and Makhija find evidence that the commissions denied many utility companies even partial recovery of nuclear construction costs on the grounds that they had been mismanaging the nuclear construction projects in ways consistent with throwing good money after bad.
There is also evidence of government representatives failing to ignore sunk costs. The term &quot;Concorde fallacy&quot; derives from the fact that the British and French governments continued to fund the joint development of the costly Concorde supersonic airplane even after it became apparent that there was no longer an economic case for the aircraft. The British government privately regarded the project as a commercial disaster that should never have been started. Political and legal issues made it impossible for either government to pull out.

The idea of sunk costs is often employed when analyzing business decisions. A common example of a sunk cost for a business is the promotion of a brand name. This type of marketing incurs costs that cannot normally be recovered. It is not typically possible to later &quot;demote&quot; one&#x27;s brand names in exchange for cash. A second example is research and development (R&amp;D) costs. Once spent, such costs are sunk and should have no effect on future pricing decisions. A pharmaceutical company&#x27;s attempt to justify high prices because of the need to recoup R&amp;D expenses would be fallacious. The company would charge a high price whether R&amp;D cost one dollar or one million. R&amp;D costs and the ability to recoup those costs are a factor in deciding whether to spend the money on R&amp;D in the first place.

Dijkstra and Hong proposed that part of a person&#x27;s behavior is influenced by a person&#x27;s current emotions. Their experiments showed that emotional responses benefit from the sunk cost fallacy. Negative influences lead to the sunk cost fallacy. For example, anxious people face the stress brought about by the sunk cost fallacy. When stressed, they are more motivated to invest in failed projects rather than take additional approaches. Their report shows that the sunk cost fallacy will have a greater impact on people under high load conditions and people&#x27;s psychological state and external environment will be the key influencing factors.

The sunk cost effect may cause cost overrun. In business, an example of sunk costs may be an investment into a factory or research that now has a lower value or none. For example, $20 million has been spent on building a power plant; the value now is zero because it is incomplete (and no sale or recovery is feasible). The plant can be completed for an additional $10 million or abandoned and a different but equally valuable facility built for $5 million. Abandonment and construction of the alternative facility is the more rational decision, even though it represents a total loss of the original expenditure—the original sum invested is a sunk cost. If decision-makers are irrational or have the &quot;wrong&quot; (different) incentives, the completion of the project may be chosen. For example, politicians or managers may have more incentive to avoid the appearance of a total loss. In practice, there is considerable ambiguity and uncertainty in such cases, and decisions may in retrospect appear irrational that were, at the time, reasonable to the economic actors involved and in the context of their incentives. A decision-maker might make rational decisions according to their incentives, outside of efficiency or profitability. This is considered to be an &quot;incentive problem&quot; and is distinct from a sunk cost problem. Some research has also noted circumstances where the &quot;sunk cost effect&quot; is reversed; that is, where individuals appear irrationally eager to write off earlier investments in order to take up a new endeavor.

=== Plan continuation bias ===
A related phenomenon is plan continuation bias, which is recognised as a subtle cognitive bias that tends to force the continuation of a plan or course of action even in the face of changing conditions. In the field of aerospace it has been recognised as a significant causal factor in accidents, with a 2004 NASA study finding that in 9 out of the 19 accidents studied, aircrew exhibited this behavioural bias.

This is a hazard for ships&#x27; captains or aircraft pilots who may stick to a planned course even when it is leading to fatal disaster and they should abort instead. A famous example is the Torrey Canyon oil spill in which a tanker ran aground when its captain persisted with a risky course rather than accepting a delay. It has been a factor in numerous air crashes and an analysis of 279 approach and landing accidents (ALAs) found that it was the fourth most common cause, occurring in 11% of cases. Another analysis of 76 accidents found that it was a contributory factor in 42% of cases.

There are also two predominant factors that characterise the bias. The first is an overly optimistic estimate of probability of success, possibly to reduce cognitive dissonance having made a decision. The second is that of personal responsibility: when you are personally accountable, it is difficult for you to admit that you were wrong.

Projects often suffer cost overruns and delays due to the planning fallacy and related factors including excessive optimism, an unwillingness to admit failure, groupthink and aversion to loss of sunk costs.

== Psychological factors ==

Evidence from behavioral economics suggests that there are at least four specific psychological factors underlying the sunk cost effect:

* Framing effects, a cognitive bias where people decide on options based on whether the options are presented with positive or negative connotations; e.g. as a loss or as a gain. People tend to avoid risk when a positive frame is presented but seek risks when a negative frame is presented.
* An overoptimistic probability bias, whereby after an investment the evaluation of one&#x27;s investment-reaping dividends is increased.
* The requisite of personal responsibility. Sunk cost appears to operate chiefly in those who feel a personal responsibility for the investments that are to be viewed as a sunk cost.
*The desire not to appear wasteful—&quot;One reason why people may wish to throw good money after bad is that to stop investing would constitute an admission that the prior money was wasted.&quot;

Taken together, these results suggest that the sunk cost effect may reflect non-standard measures of utility, which is ultimately subjective and unique to the individual.

=== Framing effect ===
The framing effect which underlies the sunk cost effect builds upon the concept of extensionality where the outcome is the same regardless of how the information is framed. This is in contradiction to the concept of intentionality, which is concerned with whether the presentation of information changes the situation in question.

Take two mathematical functions:
# 

While these functions are framed differently, regardless of the input &#x27;x&#x27;, the outcome is analytically equivalent. Therefore, if a rational decision maker were to choose between these two functions, the likelihood of each function being chosen should be the same. However, a framing effect places unequal biases towards preferences that are otherwise equal.

The most common type of framing effect was theorised in Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979 in the form of valence framing effects. This form of framing signifies types of framing. The first type can be considered positive where the &#x27;sure thing&#x27; option highlights the positivity whereas if it is negative, the &#x27;sure thing&#x27; option highlights the negativity, while both being analytically identical. For example, saving 200 people from a sinking ship of 600 is equivalent to letting 400 people drown. The former framing type is positive and the latter is negative.

Ellingsen, Johannesson, Möllerström and Munkammar have categorised framing effects in a social and economic orientation into three broad classes of theories. Firstly, the framing of options presented can affect internalised social norms or social preferences - this is called variable sociality hypothesis. Secondly, the social image hypothesis suggests that the frame in which the options are presented will affect the way the decision maker is viewed and will in turn affect their behaviour. Lastly, the frame may affect the expectations that people have about each other&#x27;s behaviour and will in turn affect their own behaviour.

=== Overoptimistic probability bias ===

In 1968, Knox and Inkster approached 141 horse bettors: 72 of the people had just finished placing a $2.00 bet within the past 30 seconds, and 69 people were about to place a $2.00 bet in the next 30 seconds. Their hypothesis was that people who had just committed themselves to a course of action (betting $2.00) would reduce post-decision dissonance by believing more strongly than ever that they had picked a winner. Knox and Inkster asked the bettors to rate their horse&#x27;s chances of winning on a 7-point scale. What they found was that people who were about to place a bet rated the chance that their horse would win at an average of 3.48 which corresponded to a &quot;fair chance of winning&quot; whereas people who had just finished betting gave an average rating of 4.81 which corresponded to a &quot;good chance of winning&quot;. Their hypothesis was confirmed: after making a $2.00 commitment, people became more confident their bet would pay off. Knox and Inkster performed an ancillary test on the patrons of the horses themselves and managed (after normalization) to repeat their finding almost identically. Other researchers have also found evidence of inflated probability estimations.

=== Sense of personal responsibility ===

In a study of 96 business students, Staw and Fox gave the subjects a choice between making an R&amp;D investment either in an underperforming company department, or in other sections of the hypothetical company. Staw and Fox divided the participants into two groups: a low responsibility condition and a high responsibility condition. In the high responsibility condition, the participants were told that they, as manager, had made an earlier, disappointing R&amp;D investment. In the low responsibility condition, subjects were told that a former manager had made a previous R&amp;D investment in the underperforming division and were given the same profit data as the other group. In both cases, subjects were then asked to make a new $20 million investment. There was a significant interaction between assumed responsibility and average investment, with the high responsibility condition averaging $12.97 million and the low condition averaging $9.43 million. Similar results have been obtained in other studies.

=== Desire not to appear wasteful ===

A ticket buyer who purchases a ticket in advance to an event they eventually turn out not to enjoy makes a semi-public commitment to watching it. To leave early is to make this lapse of judgment manifest to strangers, an appearance they might otherwise choose to avoid. As well, the person may not want to leave the event because they have already paid, so they may feel that leaving would waste their expenditure. Alternatively, they may take a sense of pride in having recognised the opportunity cost of the alternative use of time.

<text>John Whiteside Parsons (born Marvel Whiteside Parsons; October 2, 1914 – June 17, 1952) was an American rocket engineer, chemist, and Thelemite occultist. Parsons was one of the principal founders of both the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the Aerojet Engineering Corporation. He invented the first rocket engine to use a castable, composite rocket propellant, and pioneered the advancement of both liquid-fuel and solid-fuel rockets.

Parsons was raised in Pasadena, California. He began amateur rocket experiments with school friend Edward Forman in 1928. Parsons was admitted to Stanford University but left before graduating due to financial hardship during the Great Depression. In 1934, Parsons, Forman, and Frank Malina formed the Caltech-affiliated Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory (GALCIT) Rocket Research Group, with support by GALCIT chairman Theodore von Kármán. The group worked on Jet-Assisted Take Off (JATO) for the U.S. military, and founded Aerojet in 1942 to develop and sell JATO technology during World War 2. The GALCIT Rocket Research Group became JPL in 1943.

In 1939, Parsons converted to Thelema, a religious movement founded by English occultist Aleister Crowley. Parsons and his first wife, Helen Northrup, joined the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO); he became the California OTO branch leader in 1942. Historians of Western esotericism cite him as a prominent figure in propagating Thelema in North America. Parsons was dismissed from JPL and Aerojet in 1944, due to his involvement with OTO and his hazardous laboratory practices. In 1945, he and his wife divorced. In 1946, he married Marjorie Cameron. Shortly afterward, L. Ron Hubbard defrauded Parsons of his life savings. 

Parsons worked as an explosives expert during the late 1940s, but his career in rocketry ended due to accusations of espionage and the increasing trend of McCarthyism. Parsons died at the age of 37 in a home laboratory explosion in 1952; his death was officially ruled an accident but many of his associates suspected suicide or murder. Although publicly unknown during his lifetime, Parsons is now recognized for his innovations in rocket engineering, advocacy of space exploration and human spaceflight, and as an important figure in the history of the U.S. space program. He has been the subject of several biographies and fictionalized portrayals.

==Biography==
=== Early life: 1914–1934 ===
Marvel Whiteside Parsons was born on October 2, 1914, at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles. His parents, Ruth Virginia Whiteside (&quot;c.&quot; 1893–1952) and Marvel H. Parsons (&quot;c.&quot; 1894–1947), had moved to California from Massachusetts the previous year, purchasing a house on Scarff Street in downtown Los Angeles. Their son was his father&#x27;s namesake, but was known in the household as Jack. The marriage broke down soon after Jack&#x27;s birth, when Ruth discovered that her husband was sexually involved with a prostitute. Ruth filed for divorce in March 1915. Jack&#x27;s father returned to Massachusetts after being exposed as an adulterer, with Ruth forbidding him from having any contact with his infant son. Marvel Parsons later joined the U.S. Armed Forces, reaching the rank of major, and married a woman with whom he had a son, Charles, a half-brother Jack only met once. Although she retained her ex-husband&#x27;s surname, Ruth started calling her son John, but many friends throughout his life knew him as Jack.

Ruth&#x27;s parents—Walter and Carrie Whiteside—moved to California to be with Jack and their daughter, purchasing an upscale house on Orange Grove Boulevard in Pasadena—known locally as &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Mile&quot;—where they could live together. Jack was surrounded by domestic servants. Having few friends, he lived a solitary childhood and spent much time reading; he took a particular interest in works of mythology, Arthurian legend, and the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;. Through the works of Jules Verne he became interested in science fiction and a keen reader of pulp magazines like &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, which led to his early interest in rocketry.

At age 12, Parsons began attending Washington Junior High School, where he performed poorly—which biographer George Pendle attributed to undiagnosed dyslexia—and was bullied for his upper-class status and perceived effeminacy. Although unpopular, he formed a strong friendship with Edward Forman, a boy from a poor working-class family who defended him from bullies and shared his interest in science fiction and rocketry. In 1928 the pair—adopting the Latin motto &quot;per aspera ad astra&quot; (&quot;through hardship to the stars&quot;)—began engaging in homemade gunpowder-based rocket experiments in the nearby Arroyo Seco canyon, as well as the Parsons family&#x27;s back garden, which left it pockmarked with craters from explosive test failures. They incorporated commonly available fireworks such as cherry bombs into their rockets, and Parsons suggested using glue as a binding agent to increase the rocket fuel&#x27;s stability. This research became more complex when they began using materials such as aluminium foil to make the gunpowder easier to cast. Parsons had also begun to investigate occultism, and performed a ritual intended to invoke the Devil into his bedroom; he worried that the invocation was successful and was frightened into ceasing these activities. In 1929, he began attending John Muir High School, where he maintained an insular friendship with Forman and was a keen participant in fencing and archery. After he received poor school results, Parsons&#x27;s mother sent him away to study at the Brown Military Academy for Boys, a private boarding school in San Diego, but he was expelled for blowing up the toilets.

The Parsons family spent mid-1929 touring Europe before returning to Pasadena, where they moved into a house on San Rafael Avenue. With the onset of the Great Depression their fortune began to dwindle, and in July 1931 Jack&#x27;s grandfather Walter died. Parsons began studying at the privately run University School, a liberal institution that took an unconventional approach to teaching. He flourished academically, becoming editor of the school newspaper, &quot;El Universitano&quot;, and winning an award for literary excellence; teachers who had trained at the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech) guided his attention to the study of chemistry. With the family&#x27;s financial difficulties deepening, Parsons began working on weekends and school holidays at the Hercules Powder Company, where he learned more about explosives and their potential use in rocket propulsion. He and Forman continued to independently explore the subject in their spare time, building and testing different rockets, sometimes with materials that Parsons had stolen from work. Parsons soon constructed a solid-fuel rocket engine.

Parsons graduated from University School in 1933, and moved with his mother and grandmother to a more modest house on St. John Avenue, where he continued to pursue his interests in literature and poetry. He enrolled in Pasadena Junior College with the hope of earning an associate degree in physics and chemistry, but dropped out after one term because of his financial situation and took up permanent employment at the Hercules Powder Company. His employers then sent him to work at their manufacturing plant in Hercules, California on the San Francisco Bay, where he earned a relatively high monthly wage of $100; he was plagued by headaches caused by exposure to nitroglycerin. He saved money in hopes of continuing his academic studies and began a degree in chemistry at Stanford University, but found the tuition unaffordable and returned to Pasadena.

===GALCIT Rocket Research Group and the Kynette trial: 1934–1938===
In hopes of gaining access to the state-of-the-art resources of Caltech for their rocketry research, Parsons and Forman attended a lecture on the work of Austrian rocket engineer Eugen Sänger and hypothetical above-stratospheric aircraft by the institute&#x27;s William Bollay—a PhD student specializing in rocket-powered aircraft—and approached him to express their interest in designing a liquid-fuel rocket motor. Bollay redirected them to another PhD student, Frank Malina, a mathematician and mechanical engineer writing a thesis on rocket propulsion who shared their interests and soon befriended them. Parsons, Forman, and Malina applied for funding from Caltech together; they did not mention that their ultimate objective was to develop rockets for space exploration, realizing that most of the scientific establishment then considered such ideas science fiction. Caltech&#x27;s Clark Blanchard Millikan immediately rebuffed them, but Malina&#x27;s doctoral advisor Theodore von Kármán saw more promise in their proposal and agreed to allow them to operate under the auspices of the university&#x27;s Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory (GALCIT). Naming themselves the GALCIT Rocket Research Group, they gained access to Caltech&#x27;s specialist equipment, though the economics of the Great Depression left von Kármán unable to finance them.

The trio focused their distinct skills on collaborative rocket development; Parsons was the chemist, Forman the machinist, and Malina the technical theoretician. Malina wrote in 1968 that the self-educated Parsons &quot;lacked the discipline of a formal higher education, [but] had an uninhibited and fruitful imagination.&quot; Parsons and Forman who, as described by Geoffrey A. Landis, &quot;were eager to try whatever idea happened to spring to mind&quot;, contrasted with Malina, who insisted on scientific discipline as informed by von Kármán. Landis writes that their creativity &quot;kept Malina focused toward building actual rocket engines, not just solving equations on paper&quot;. Sharing socialist values, they operated on an egalitarian basis; Malina taught the others about scientific procedure and they taught him about the practical elements of rocketry. They often socialized, smoking marijuana and drinking, while Malina and Parsons set about writing a semiautobiographical science fiction screenplay they planned to pitch to Hollywood with strong anti-capitalist and pacifist themes.

Parsons met Helen Northrup at a local church dance and proposed marriage in July 1934. She accepted and they were married in April 1935 at the Little Church of the Flowers in Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, before undertaking a brief honeymoon in San Diego. They moved into a house on South Terrace Drive, Pasadena, while Parsons got a job at the explosives manufacturer Halifax Powder Company&#x27;s facility in Saugus. Much to Helen&#x27;s dismay, Parsons spent most of his wages funding the GALCIT Rocket Research Group. For extra money, he manufactured nitroglycerin in their home, constructing a laboratory on their front porch. At one point, he pawned Helen&#x27;s engagement ring, and he often asked her family for loans.

Malina recounted that &quot;Parsons and Forman were not too pleased with an austere program that did not include at least the launching of model rockets&quot;, but the Group reached the consensus of developing a working static rocket motor before embarking on more complex research. They contacted liquid-fuel rocket pioneer Robert H. Goddard and he invited Malina to his facility in Roswell, New Mexico, but he was not interested in cooperating—reticent about sharing his research and having been subjected to widespread derision for his work in rocketry. They were instead joined by Caltech graduate students Apollo M. O. &quot;Amo&quot; Smith, Carlos C. Wood, Mark Muir Mills, Fred S. Miller, William C. Rockefeller, and Rudolph Schott; Schott&#x27;s pickup truck transported their equipment. Their first liquid-fuel motor test took place near the Devil&#x27;s Gate Dam in the Arroyo Seco on Halloween 1936. Parsons&#x27;s biographer John Carter described the layout of the contraption as showing

Three attempts to fire the rocket failed; on the fourth the oxygen line accidentally ignited and perilously billowed fire at the Group, but they viewed this experience as formative. They continued their experiments throughout the last quarter of 1936; after the final test was successfully completed in January 1937 von Kármán agreed that they could perform future experiments at an exclusive rocket testing facility on campus.
In April 1937, Caltech mathematician Qian Xuesen joined the Group. Several months later, Weld Arnold, a Caltech laboratory assistant who worked as the Group&#x27;s official photographer, also joined. The main reason for Arnold&#x27;s appointment to this position was his provision of a donation to the Group on behalf of an anonymous benefactor. They became well known on campus as the &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; for the dangerous nature of some of their experiments and attracted attention from the local press. Parsons himself gained further media publicity when he appeared as an expert explosives witness in the trial of Captain Earl Kynette, the head of police intelligence in Los Angeles who was accused of conspiring to set a car bomb in the attempted murder of private investigator Harry Raymond, a former LAPD detective who was fired after whistleblowing against police corruption. When Kynette was convicted largely on Parsons&#x27; testimony, which included his forensic reconstruction of the car bomb and its explosion, his identity as an expert scientist in the public eye was established despite his lack of a university education. While working at Caltech, Parsons was admitted to evening courses in chemistry at the University of Southern California (USC), but distracted by his GALCIT workload he attended sporadically and received unexceptional grades.

By early 1938, the Group had made their static rocket motor, which originally burned for three seconds, run for over a minute. In May that year, Parsons was invited by Forrest J Ackerman to lecture on his rocketry work at Chapter Number 4 of the Los Angeles Science Fiction League (LASFL). Although he never joined the society, he occasionally attended their talks, on one occasion conversing with a teenage Ray Bradbury. Another scientist to become involved in the GALCIT project was Sidney Weinbaum, a Jewish refugee from Europe who was a vocal Marxist; he led Parsons, Malina, and Qian in their creation of a largely secretive communist discussion group at Caltech, which became known as Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party. Although Parsons subscribed to the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily World&quot; and joined the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), he refused to join the American Communist Party, causing a break in his and Weinbaum&#x27;s friendship. This, coupled with the need to focus on paid employment, led to the disintegration of much of the Rocket Research Group, leaving only its three founding members by late 1938.

===Embracing Thelema; advancing JATO and foundation of Aerojet: 1939–1942===

In January 1939, John and Frances Baxter, a brother and sister who had befriended Jack and Helen Parsons, took Jack to the Church of Thelema on Winona Boulevard, Hollywood, where he witnessed the performance of The Gnostic Mass. Celebrants of the church had included Hollywood actor John Carradine and gay rights activist Harry Hay. Parsons was intrigued, having already heard of Thelema&#x27;s founder and Outer Head of Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), Aleister Crowley, after reading a copy of Crowley&#x27;s text &quot;Konx om Pax&quot; (1907).

Parsons was introduced to leading members Regina Kahl, Jane Wolfe, and Wilfred Talbot Smith at the mass. Feeling both &quot;repulsion and attraction&quot; for Smith, Parsons continued to sporadically attend the Church&#x27;s events for a year. He continued to read Crowley&#x27;s works, which increasingly interested him, and encouraged Helen to read them. Parsons came to believe in the reality of Thelemic magick as a force that could be explained through quantum physics. He tried to interest his friends and acquaintances in Thelema, taking science fiction writers Jack Williamson and Cleve Cartmill to a performance of The Gnostic Mass. Although they were unimpressed, Parsons was more successful with Grady Louis McMurtry, a young Caltech student he had befriended, as well as McMurtry&#x27;s fiancée Claire Palmer, and Helen&#x27;s sister Sara &quot;Betty&quot; Northrup.

Jack and Helen were initiated into the Agape Lodge, the renamed Church of Thelema, in February 1941. Parsons adopted the Thelemic motto of &quot;Thelema Obtenteum Proedero Amoris Nuptiae&quot;, a Latin mistranslation of &quot;The establishment of Thelema through the rituals of love&quot;. The initials of this motto spelled out T.O.P.A.N., also serving as the declaration &quot;To Pan&quot;. Commenting on Parsons&#x27; errors of translation, in jest Crowley said that &quot;the motto which you mention is couched in a language beyond my powers of understanding&quot;. Parsons also adopted the Thelemic title &quot;Frater T.O.P.A.N&quot;—with &quot;T.O.P.A.N&quot; represented in Kabbalistic numerology as &quot;210&quot;the name with which he frequently signed letters to occult associates—while Helen became known as &quot;Soror Grimaud&quot;. Smith wrote to Crowley saying that Parsons was &quot;a really excellent man ... He has an excellent mind and much better intellect than myself ... JP is going to be very valuable&quot;. Wolfe wrote to German O.T.O. representative Karl Germer that Parsons was &quot;an A1 man ... Crowleyesque in attainment as a matter of fact&quot;, and mooted Parsons as a potential successor to Crowley as Outer Head of the Order. Crowley concurred with such assessments, informing Smith that Parsons &quot;is the most valued member of the whole Order, with no exception!&quot;

At von Kármán&#x27;s suggestion, Frank Malina approached the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee on Army Air Corps Research to request funding for research into what they referred to as &quot;jet propulsion&quot;, a term chosen to avoid the stigma attached to rocketry. The military were interested in jet propulsion as a means of getting aircraft quickly airborne where there was insufficient room for a full-length runway, and gave the Rocket Research Group $1,000 to put together a proposal on the feasibility of Jet-Assisted Take Off (JATO) by June 1939, making Parsons et al. the first U.S. government-sanctioned rocket research group. Since their formation in 1934, they had also performed experiments involving model, black powder motor-propelled multistage rockets. In a research paper submitted to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), Parsons reported these rockets reaching exhaust velocities of 4,875 miles per hour, thereby demonstrating the potential of solid fuels to be more effective than the liquid types primarily preferred by researchers such as Goddard. In light of this progress, Caltech and the GALCIT Group received an additional $10,000 rocketry research grant from the AIAA.

Although a quarter of their funding went to repairing damage to Caltech buildings caused by their experiments, in June 1940 they submitted a report to the NAS in which they showed the feasibility of the project for the development of JATO and requested $100,000 to continue; they received $22,000. Now known as GALCIT Project Number 1, they continued to be ostracized by other Caltech scientists who grew increasingly irritated by their accidents and noise pollution, and were forced to relocate their experiments back to the Arroyo Seco, at a site with unventilated, corrugated iron sheds that served as both research facilities and administrative offices. It was here that JPL would be founded. Parsons and Forman&#x27;s rocket experiments were the cover story of the August 1940 edition of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, in which the pair discussed the prospect of rockets being able to ascend above Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and orbit around it for research purposes, as well as reaching the Moon.

For the JATO project, they were joined by Caltech mathematician Martin Summerfield and 18 workers supplied by the Works Progress Administration. Former colleagues like Qian were prevented from returning to the project by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), who ensured the secrecy of the operation and restricted the involvement of foreign nationals and political extremists. The FBI was satisfied that Parsons was not a Marxist but were concerned when Thelemite friend Paul Seckler used Parsons&#x27; gun in a drunken car hijacking, for which Seckler was imprisoned in San Quentin State Prison for two years. Englishman George Emerson replaced Arnold as the Group&#x27;s official photographer.

The Group&#x27;s aim was to find a replacement for black-powder rocket motors—units consisting of charcoal, sulfur and potassium nitrate with a binding agent. The mixture was unstable and there were frequent explosions damaging military aircraft. The solid JATO fuel invented by Parsons consisted of amide, corn starch, and ammonium nitrate bound together in the JATO unit with glue and blotting paper. It was codenamed GALCIT-27, implying the previous invention of 26 new fuels. The first JATO tests using an ERCO Ercoupe plane took place in late July 1941; though they aided propulsion, the units frequently exploded and damaged the aircraft. Parsons theorized that this was because the ammonium nitrate became dangerously combustible following overnight storage, during which temperature and consistency changes had resulted in a chemical imbalance. Parsons and Malina accordingly devised a method in which they would fill the JATOs with the fuel in the early mornings shortly before the tests, enduring sleep deprivation to do so. On August 21, 1941, Navy Captain Homer J. Boushey, Jr.—watched by Clark Millikan and William F. Durand—piloted the JATO-equipped Ercoupe at March Air Force Base in Moreno Valley, California. It proved a success and reduced takeoff distance by 30%, but one of the JATOs partially exploded. Over the following weeks 62 further tests took place, and the NAS increased their grant to $125,000. During a series of static experiments, an exploding JATO did significant damage to the rear fuselage of an Ercoupe; one observer optimistically noted that &quot;at least it wasn&#x27;t a big hole&quot;, but necessary repairs delayed their efforts.

The military ordered a flight test using liquid rather than solid fuel in early 1942. Upon the United States&#x27; entry into the Second World War in December 1941, the Group realized they could be drafted directly into military service if they failed to provide viable JATO technology for the military. Informed by their left-wing politics, aiding the war effort against Nazi Germany and the Axis powers was as much of a moral vocation to Parsons, Forman and Malina as it was a practical one. Parsons, Summerfield and the GALCIT workers focused on the task and found success with a combination of gasoline with red fuming nitric acid as its oxidizer; the latter, suggested by Parsons, was an effective substitute for liquid oxygen. The testing of this fuel resulted in another calamity, when the testing rocket motor exploded; the fire, containing iron shed fragments and shrapnel, inexplicably left the experimenters unscathed. Malina solved the problem by replacing the gasoline with aniline, resulting in a successful test launch of a JATO-equipped A-20A plane at the Muroc Auxiliary Air Field in the Mojave Desert. It provided five times more thrust than GALCIT-27, and again reduced takeoff distance by 30%; Malina wrote to his parents that &quot;We now have something that really works and we should be able to help give the Fascists hell!&quot;


The Group then agreed to produce and sell 60 JATO engines to the United States Army Air Corps. To do so they formed the Aerojet Engineering Corporation in March 1942, in which Parsons, Forman, Malina, von Kármán, and Summerfield each invested $250, opening their offices on Colorado Boulevard and bringing in Amo Smith as their engineer. Andrew G. Haley was recruited by von Kármán as their lawyer and treasurer. Although Aerojet was a for-profit operation that provided technology for military means, the founders&#x27; mentality was rooted in the ideal of using rockets for peaceful space exploration. As Haley recounted von Kármán requesting: &quot;we will make the rockets—you must make the corporation and obtain the money. Later on you will have to see that we all behave well in outer space.&quot;

Despite these successes, Parsons, the project engineer of Aerojet&#x27;s Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated to address the malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust and did not have the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27&#x27;s stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former&#x27;s ammonium nitrate with guanidine nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel&#x27;s binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid asphalt as an appropriate binding agent with potassium perchlorate as oxidizer.

Malina recounted that Parsons was inspired to use asphalt by the ancient incendiary weapon Greek fire; in a 1982 talk for the International Association of Astronomical Artists Captain Boushey stated that Parsons experienced an epiphany after watching workers using molten asphalt to fix tiles onto a roof. Known as GALCIT-53, this fuel proved to be significantly more stable than the Group&#x27;s earlier concoctions, fulfilling Parsons&#x27; aim of creating a restricted-burn rocket fuel inside a castable container, and providing a thrust 427% more powerful than that of GALCIT-27. This set a precedent which according to his biographer John Carter &quot;changed the future of rocket technology&quot;: the thermoplastic asphalt casting was durable in all climates, allowing for mass production and indefinite storage and transforming solid-fuel agents into a safe and viable form of rocket propulsion. Plasticized variants of Parsons&#x27; solid-fuel design invented by JPL&#x27;s Charles Bartley were later used by NASA in Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters and by the Strategic Air Command in Polaris, Poseidon and Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles.

===Foundation of JPL and leading the Agape Lodge: 1942–1944===

Aerojet&#x27;s first two contracts were from the U.S. Navy; the Bureau of Aeronautics requested a solid-fuel JATO and Wilbur Wright Field requested a liquid-fuel unit. The Air Corps had requested two thousand JATOs from Aerojet by late 1943, committing $256,000 toward Parsons&#x27; solid-fuel type. Despite this drastically increased turnover, the company continued to operate informally and remained intertwined with the GALCIT project. Caltech astronomer Fritz Zwicky was brought in as head of the company&#x27;s research department. Haley replaced von Kármán as Aerojet chairman and imposed payroll cuts instead of reducing JATO output; the alternative was to cut staff numbers while maintaining more generous salaries, but Haley&#x27;s priority was Aerojet&#x27;s contribution to the war effort. Company heads including Parsons were exempted from this austerity, drawing the ire of many personnel.

Parsons&#x27; newfound credentials and financial security gave him the opportunity to travel more widely throughout the U.S. as an ambassador for Aerojet, meeting with other rocket enthusiasts. In New York he met with Karl Germer, the head of the O.T.O. in North America and in Washington, D.C. he met Poet Laureate Joseph Auslander, donating some of Crowley&#x27;s poetry books to the Library of Congress. He also became a regular at the Mañana Literary Society, which met in Laurel Canyon at the home of Parsons&#x27; friend Robert A. Heinlein and included science fiction writers including Cleve Cartmill, Jack Williamson, and Anthony Boucher. Among Parsons&#x27; favorite works of fiction was Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Darker Than You Think&quot;, a novelette published in the fantasy magazine &quot;Unknown&quot; in 1940, which inspired his later occult workings. Boucher used Parsons as a partial basis for the character of Hugo Chantrelle in his murder mystery &quot;Rocket to the Morgue&quot; (1942).

Helen went away for a period in June 1941, during which Parsons, encouraged to do so by the sexually permissive attitude of the O.T.O., began a sexual relationship with her 17-year-old sister, Sara. Upon Helen&#x27;s return, Sara asserted that she was Parsons&#x27; new wife, and Parsons himself admitted that he found Sara more sexually attractive than Helen. Conflicted in her feelings, Helen sought comfort in Wilfred Talbot Smith and began a relationship with him that lasted for the rest of his life; the four remained friends. The two couples, along with a number of other Thelemites (some of whom with their children), moved to 1003 South Orange Grove Boulevard, an American Craftsman-style mansion. They all contributed to the rent of $100 a month and lived communally in what replaced Winona Boulevard as the new base of the Agape Lodge, maintaining an allotment and slaughtering their own livestock for meat as well as blood rituals. Parsons decorated his new room with a copy of the Stele of Revealing, a statue of Pan, and his collection of swords and daggers. He converted the garage and laundry room into a chemical laboratory and often held science fiction discussion meetings in the kitchen, and entertained the children with hunts for fairies in the 25-acre garden.

Although there were arguments among the commune members, Parsons remained dedicated to Thelema. He gave almost all of his salary to the O.T.O. while actively seeking out new membersincluding Formanand financially supported Crowley in London through Germer. Parsons&#x27; enthusiasm for the Lodge quickly began to impact on his professional life. He frequently appeared at Aerojet hungover and sleep-deprived from late nights of Lodge activities, and invited many of his colleagues to them, drawing the ire of staff who previously tolerated Parsons&#x27; occultism as harmless eccentricity; known to von Kármán as a &quot;delightful screwball&quot;, he was frequently observed reciting Crowley&#x27;s poem &quot;Hymn to Pan&quot; in an ecstatic manner compared to the preaching of Billy Graham during rocket testsand on request at parties to their great amusement. They disapproved of his hesitancy to separate his vocations; Parsons became more rigorously engaged in Aerojet&#x27;s day-to-day business in an effort to resolve this weariness, but the Agape Lodge soon came under investigation by both the Pasadena Police Department and the FBI. Both had received allegations of a &quot;black magic cult&quot; involved in sexual orgies; one complainant was a 16-year-old boy who said that he was raped by lodge members, while neighbors reported a ritual involving a naked pregnant woman jumping through fire. After Parsons explained that the Lodge was simply &quot;an organization dedicated to religious and philosophical speculation&quot;, neither agency found evidence of illegal activity and came to the conclusion that the Lodge constituted no threat to national security. Having been a long-term heavy user of alcohol and marijuana, Parsons now habitually used cocaine, amphetamines, peyote, mescaline, and opiates as well. He continued to have sexual relations with multiple women, including McMurtry&#x27;s fiancée Claire. When Parsons paid for her to have an abortion, McMurtry was angered and their friendship broke down.
Crowley and Germer wanted to see Smith removed as head of the Agape Lodge, believing that he had become a bad influence on its members. Parsons and Helen wrote to them to defend their mentor but Germer ordered him to stand down; Parsons was appointed as temporary head of the Lodge. Some veteran Lodge members disliked Parsons&#x27; influence, concerned that it encouraged excessive sexual polyandry that was religiously detrimental, but his charismatic orations at Lodge meetings assured his popularity among the majority of followers. Parsons soon created the Thelemite journal &quot;Oriflamme&quot;, in which he published his own poetry, but Crowley was unimpressedparticularly due to Parsons&#x27; descriptions of drug useand the project was soon shelved. Helen gave birth to Smith&#x27;s son in April; the child was named Kwen Lanval Parsons. Smith and Helen left with Kwen for a two-room cabin in Rainbow Valley in May. Concurrently in England, Crowley undertook an astrological analysis of Smith&#x27;s birth chart and came to the conclusion that Smith was the incarnation of a god, greatly altering his estimation of him. Smith remained skeptical as Crowley&#x27;s analysis was seemingly deliberately devised in Parsons&#x27; favor, encouraging Smith to step down from his role in the Agape Lodge and instructing him to take a meditative retreat. Refusing to take orders from Germer any more, Smith resigned from the O.T.O. Parsons—who remained sympathetic and friendly to Smith during the conflict and was weary of Crowley&#x27;s &quot;appalling egotism, bad taste, bad judgement, and pedanticism&quot;—ceased lodge activities and resigned as its head, but withdrew his resignation after receiving a pacifying letter from Crowley.
By mid-1943, Aerojet was operating on a budget of $650,000. The same year Parsons and von Kármán traveled to Norfolk, Virginia on the invitation of Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox to consult on a new JATO contract for the U.S. Navy. Though JATOs were being mass-produced for military applications, JATO-propelled aircraft could not &quot;keep up&quot; with larger, bomber planes taking off from long aircraft carrier runways—which made Aerojet&#x27;s industry at risk of becoming defunct. Parsons demonstrated the efficacy of the newer JATOs to solve this issue by equipping a Grumman plane with solid-fuel units; its assisted takeoff from the USS &quot;Charger&quot; was successful, but produced smoke containing a noxious, yellow-colored residue. The Navy guaranteed Parsons a contract on the condition that this residue was removed; this led to the invention of &quot;Aeroplex&quot;, a technology for smokeless vapor trails developed at Aerojet by Parsons.

As the U.S. became aware that Nazi Germany had developed the V-2 rocket, the military—following recommendations from von Kármán based upon research using British intelligence—placed a renewed impetus on its own rocket research, reinstating Qian to the GALCIT project. They gave the Group a $3 million grant to develop rocket-based weapons, and the Group was expanded and renamed the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). By this point the Navy were ordering 20,000 JATOs a month from Aerojet, and in December 1944 Haley negotiated for the company to sell 51% of its stock to the General Tire and Rubber Company to cope with the increased demand. Aerojet&#x27;s Caltech-linked employees—including Zwicky, Malina and Summerfield—would only agree to the sale on the condition that Parsons and Forman were removed from the company, viewing their occult activities as disreputable. JPL historian Erik M. Conway also attributes Parsons&#x27; expulsion to more practical concerns: he &quot;still wanted to work in the same way as he&#x27;d done in his backyard, instinctive and without regard for safety&quot;. Parsons and Forman were unfazed, informing Haley of their prediction that the rocket industry would become obsolete in the postwar age and seeing more financial incentive in starting a chain of laundromats. Haley persuaded them to sell their stock, resulting in Parsons leaving the company with $11,000. With this money he bought the lease to 1003, which had come to be known as &quot;the Parsonage&quot; after him.

===L. Ron Hubbard and the Babalon Working: 1945–1946===
Now disassociated from JPL and Aerojet, Parsons and Forman founded the Ad Astra Engineering Company, under which Parsons founded the chemical manufacturing Vulcan Powder Company. Ad Astra was subject to an FBI investigation under suspicion of espionage when security agents from the Manhattan Project discovered that Parsons and Forman had procured a chemical used in a top secret project for a material known only as &quot;x-metal&quot;, but they were later acquitted of any wrongdoing.

Parsons continued to financially support Smith and Helen, although he asked for a divorce from her and ignored Crowley&#x27;s commands by welcoming Smith back to the Parsonage when his retreat was finished. Parsons continued to hold O.T.O. activities at the Parsonage but began renting rooms at the house to non-Thelemites, including journalist Nieson Himmel, Manhattan Project physicist Robert Cornog, and science fiction artist Louis Goldstone. Parsons attracted controversy in Pasadena for his preferred clientele. As Parsonage resident Alva Rogers recalled: &quot;In the ads placed in the local paper Jack specified that only bohemians, artists, musicians, atheists, anarchists, or any other exotic types need to apply for rooms—any mundane soul would be unceremoniously rejected&quot;.

Science fiction writer and U.S. Navy officer L. Ron Hubbard soon moved into the Parsonage; he and Parsons became close friends. Parsons wrote to Crowley that although Hubbard had &quot;no formal training in Magick he has an extraordinary amount of experience and understanding in the field. From some of his experiences I deduce he is in direct touch with some higher intelligence, possibly his Guardian Angel. ... He is the most Thelemic person I have ever met and is in complete accord with our own principles.&quot;

Parsons and Sara were in an open relationship encouraged by the O.T.O.&#x27;s polyamorous sexual ethics, and she became enamored with Hubbard; Parsons, despite attempting to repress his passions, became intensely jealous. Motivated to find a new partner through occult means, Parsons began to devote his energies to conducting black magic, causing concern among fellow O.T.O. members who believed that he was invoking troublesome spirits into the Parsonage; Jane Wolfe wrote to Crowley that &quot;our own Jack is enamored with Witchcraft, the houmfort, voodoo. From the start he always wanted to evoke something—no matter what, I am inclined to think, as long as he got a result.&quot; He told the residents that he was imbuing statues in the house with a magical energy in order to sell them to fellow occultists.

Parsons reported paranormal events in the house resulting from the rituals; including poltergeist activity, sightings of orbs and ghostly apparitions, alchemical (sylphic) effect on the weather, and disembodied voices. Pendle suggested that Parsons was particularly susceptible to these interpretations and attributed the voices to a prank by Hubbard and Sara. One ritual allegedly brought screaming banshees to the windows of the Parsonage, an incident that disturbed Forman for the rest of his life. In December 1945, Parsons began a series of rituals based on Enochian magic during which he masturbated onto magical tablets, accompanied by Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s Second Violin Concerto. Describing this magical operation as the Babalon Working, he hoped to bring about the incarnation of Thelemite goddess Babalon onto Earth. He allowed Hubbard to take part as his &quot;scribe&quot;, believing that he was particularly sensitive to detecting magical phenomena. As described by Richard Metzger, &quot;Parsons jerked off in the name of spiritual advancement&quot; while Hubbard &quot;scanned the astral plane for signs and visions.&quot;

Their final ritual took place in the Mojave Desert in late February 1946, during which Parsons abruptly decided that his undertaking was complete. On returning to the Parsonage, he discovered that Marjorie Cameron—an unemployed illustrator and former Navy WAVE—had come to visit. Believing her to be the &quot;elemental&quot; woman and manifestation of Babalon that he had invoked, in early March Parsons began performing sex magic rituals with Cameron, who acted as his &quot;Scarlet Woman&quot;, while Hubbard continued to participate as the amanuensis. Unlike the rest of the household, Cameron knew nothing at first of Parsons&#x27; magical intentions: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know anything about the O.T.O., I didn&#x27;t know that they had invoked me, I didn&#x27;t know anything, but the whole house knew it. Everybody was watching to see what was going on.&quot; Despite this ignorance and her skepticism about Parsons&#x27; magic, Cameron reported her sighting of a UFO to Parsons, who secretly recorded the sighting as a materialization of Babalon.

Inspired by Crowley&#x27;s novel &quot;Moonchild&quot; (1917), Parsons and Hubbard aimed to magically fertilize a &quot;magical child&quot; through Immaculate Conception, which when born to a woman somewhere on Earth nine months following the working&#x27;s completion would become the Thelemic messiah embodying Babalon. To quote Metzger, the purpose of the Babalon Working was &quot;a daring attempt to shatter the boundaries of space and time&quot; facilitating, according to Parsons, the emergence of Thelema&#x27;s Æon of Horus. When Cameron departed for a trip to New York, Parsons retreated to the desert, where he believed that a preternatural entity psychographically provided him with &quot;Liber 49&quot;, which represented a fourth part of Crowley&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;, the primary sacred text of Thelema, as well as part of a new sacred text he called the &quot;Book of Babalon&quot;. Crowley was bewildered and concerned by the endeavor, complaining to Germer of being &quot;fairly frantic when I contemplate the idiocy of these louts!&quot; Believing the Babalon Working was accomplished, Parsons sold the Parsonage to developers for $25,000 under the condition that he and Cameron could continue to live in the coach house, and he appointed Roy Leffingwell to head the Agape Lodge, which would now have to meet elsewhere for its rituals.

Parsons co-founded a company called Allied Enterprises with Hubbard and Sara, into which Parsons invested his life savings of $20,970. Hubbard suggested that with this money they travel to Miami to purchase three yachts, which they would then sail through the Panama Canal to the West Coast, where they could sell them on for a profit. Parsons agreed, but many of his friends thought it was a bad idea. Hubbard had secretly requested permission from the U.S. Navy to sail to China and South and Central America on a mission to &quot;collect writing material&quot;; his real plans were for a world cruise. Left &quot;flat broke&quot; by this defrauding, Parsons was incensed when he discovered that Hubbard and Sara had left for Miami with $10,000 of the money; he suspected a scam but was placated by a telephone call from Hubbard and agreed to remain business partners.

When Crowley, in a telegram to Germer, dismissed Parsons as a &quot;weak fool&quot; and victim to Hubbard and Sara&#x27;s obvious confidence trick, Parsons changed his mind, flew to Miami and placed a temporary injunction and restraining order on them. Upon tracking them down to a harbor in County Causeway, Parsons discovered that the couple had purchased three yachts as planned; they tried to flee aboard one but hit a squall and were forced to return to port. Parsons was convinced that he had brought them to shore through a lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram containing an astrological, geomantic invocation of Bartzabela vengeful spirit of Mars. Allied Enterprises was dissolved and in a court settlement Hubbard was required to promise to reimburse Parsons. Parsons was discouraged from taking further action by Sara, who threatened to report him for statutory rape since their sexual relationship took place when she was under California&#x27;s age of consent of 18. Parsons was ultimately compensated with only $2,900. Hubbard, already married to Margaret Grubb, bigamously married Sara and went on to found Dianetics and Scientology.

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; published an article about Hubbard&#x27;s involvement with the O.T.O. and Parsons&#x27; occult activities in December 1969. In response, the Church of Scientology released an unsubstantiated press statement which said that Hubbard had been sent as an undercover agent by the U.S. Navy to intercept and destroy Parsons&#x27; &quot;black magic cult&quot;, and save Sara from its influence. The Church also stated that Robert A. Heinlein was the clandestine Navy operative who &quot;sent in&quot; Hubbard to undertake this operation. Returning to California, Parsons completed the sale of the Parsonage, which was then demolished, and resigned from the O.T.O. He wrote in his letter to Crowley that he did not believe that &quot;as an autocratic organization, [the O.T.O.] constitutes a true and proper medium for the expression and attainment&quot; of Thelema.

===Loss of FBI clearance, Red Scare Marxist and espionage accusations and acquittal: 1946–1952===
Parsons was employed by North American Aviation at Inglewood, where he worked on the Navaho Missile Program. He and Cameron moved into a house in Manhattan Beach, where he instructed her in occultism and esotericism. When Cameron developed catalepsy, Parsons referred her to Sylvan Muldoon&#x27;s books on astral projection, suggesting that she could manipulate her seizures to accomplish it. They were married on October 19, 1946, four days after his divorce from Helen was finalized, with Forman as their witness. Parsons continued to be seen as a specialist in rocketry; he acted as an expert consultant in numerous industrial tribunals and police and Army Ordnance investigations regarding explosions. In May 1947, Parsons gave a talk at the Pacific Rocket Society in which he predicted that rockets would take humans to the Moon. Although he had become distant from the now largely defunct O.T.O. and had sold much of his Crowleyan library, he continued to correspond with Crowley until the latter&#x27;s death in December 1947.

At the emergence of the Cold War, a Red Scare developed in the U.S. as the Congressional House Un-American Activities Committee began investigating and obstructing the careers of people with perceived communist sympathies. Many of Parsons&#x27; former colleagues lost their security clearances and jobs as a result, and eventually the FBI stripped Parsons of his clearance because of his &quot;subversive&quot; character, including his involvement in and advocacy of &quot;sexual perversion&quot; in the O.T.O. He speculated in a June 1949 letter to Germer that his clearance was revoked in response to his public dissemination of Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Liber OZ&quot;, a 1941 tract summarizing the individualist moral principles of Thelema. Declassified FBI documents later revealed that the FBI&#x27;s primary concern was Parsons&#x27; former connections to Marxists at Caltech and his membership of the also &quot;subversive&quot; ACLU. When they interviewed Parsons, he denied communist sympathies but informed them of Sidney Weinbaum&#x27;s &quot;extreme communist views&quot; and Frank Malina&#x27;s involvement in Weinbaum&#x27;s communist cell at Caltech, which resulted in Weinbaum&#x27;s arrest for perjury since he had lied under oath by denying any involvement in communist groups. Malina&#x27;s security clearance was withdrawn as well. In reaction to this hostile treatment, Parsons sought work in the rocket industry abroad. He sought advice to do so in correspondence with von Kármán; whose advice he followed by enrolling in an evening course in advanced mathematics at USC to bolster his employability in the field—but again he neglected attendance and failed the course. Parsons again resorted to bootlegging nitroglycerin for money, and managed to earn a wage as a car mechanic, a manual laborer at a gas station, and a hospital orderly; for two years he was also a faculty member at the USC Department of Pharmacology. Relations between Parsons and Cameron became strained; they agreed to a temporary separation and she moved to Mexico to join an artists&#x27; commune in San Miguel de Allende.

Unable to pursue his scientific career, without his wife and devoid of friendship, Parsons decided to return to occultism and embarked on sexually based magical operations with prostitutes. He was intent, informally following the ritualistic practice of Thelemite organization the A∴A∴, on performing &quot;the Crossing of the Abyss&quot;, attaining union with the universal consciousness, or &quot;All&quot; as understood in the context of the Great Work, and becoming the &quot;Master of the Temple&quot;. Following his apparent success in doing so, Parsons recounted having an out-of-body experience invoked by Babalon, who astrally transported him to the biblical City of Chorazin, an experience he referred to as a &quot;Black Pilgrimage&quot;. Accompanying Parsons&#x27; &quot;Oath of the Abyss&quot; was his own &quot;Oath of the AntiChrist&quot;, which was witnessed by Wilfred Talbot Smith. In this oath, Parsons professed to embody an entity named &quot;Belarion Armillus Al Dajjal&quot;, the Antichrist &quot;who am come to fulfill the law of the Beast 666 [Aleister Crowley]&quot;. Viewing these oaths as the completion of the Babalon Working, Parsons wrote an illeist autobiography titled &quot;Analysis by a Master of the Temple&quot; and an occult text titled &quot;The Book of AntiChrist&quot;. In the latter work, Parsons (writing as &quot;Belarion&quot;) prophesied that within nine years Babalon would manifest on Earth and supersede the dominance of the Abrahamic religions.

During this period, Parsons also wrote an essay on his individualist philosophy and politics—which he described as standing for &quot;liberalism and liberal principles&quot;—titled &quot;Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword&quot;, in which he condemned the authoritarianism, censorship, corruption, antisexualism and racism he saw as prevalent in American society. None of these works were published in his lifetime. Through Heinlein, Parsons received a visit from writer L. Sprague de Camp, with whom he discussed magic and science fiction, and disclosed that Hubbard had sent a letter offering him Sara back. De Camp later referred to Parsons as &quot;An authentic mad genius if I ever met one&quot;, and based the character Courtney James on him in his time travel short story &quot;A Gun for Dinosaur&quot; (1956). Parsons was also visited by Jane Wolfe, who unsuccessfully appealed for him to rejoin the dilapidated O.T.O. He entered a brief relationship with an Irishwoman named Gladis Gohan; they moved to a house in Redondo Beach, a building known by them as the &quot;Concrete Castle&quot;. Cameron returned to Redondo Beach from San Miguel de Allende and violently argued with Parsons upon discovering his infidelity, before she again left for Mexico. Parsons responded by initiating divorce proceedings against her on the grounds of &quot;extreme cruelty&quot;.
Parsons testified to a closed federal court that the moral philosophy of Thelema was both anti-fascist and anti-communist, emphasizing his belief in individualism. This along with references from his scientific colleagues resulted in his security clearance being reinstated by the Industrial Employment Review Board, which ruled that there was insufficient evidence that he had ever had communist sympathies. This allowed Parsons to obtain a contract in designing and constructing a chemical plant for the Hughes Aircraft Company in Culver City. Von Kármán put Parsons in touch with Herbert T. Rosenfeld, President of the Southern Californian chapter of the American Technion Societya Zionist group dedicated to supporting the newly created State of Israel. Rosenfeld offered Parsons a job with the Israeli rocket program and hired him to produce technical reports for them. In November 1950, as the Red Scare intensified, Parsons decided to migrate to Israel to pursue Rosenfeld&#x27;s offer, but a Hughes secretary whom Parsons had asked to type up a portfolio of technical documents reported him to the FBI. She accused Parsons of espionage and attempted theft of classified company documents on the basis of some of the reports that he had sought to submit to the Technion Society.

Parsons was immediately fired from Hughes; the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for the Israeli government. Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated; he insisted that his intentions were peaceful and that he had suffered an error of judgment in procuring the documents. Some of Parsons&#x27; scientific colleagues rallied to his defense, but the case against him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult and sexually permissive activities at the Parsonage came to light. In October 1951, the U.S. attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was not guilty of espionage.

The Review Board still considered Parsons a liability because of his historical Marxist affiliations and investigations by the FBI, and in January 1952 they permanently reinstated their ban on his working for classified projects, effectively prohibiting him from working in rocketry. To make a living he founded the Parsons Chemical Manufacturing Company, which was based in North Hollywood and created pyrotechnics and explosives such as fog effects and imitation gunshot wounds for the film industry, and he also returned to chemical manufacturing at the Bermite Powder Company in Saugus.
Parsons reconciled with Cameron, and they resumed their relationship and moved into a former coach house on Orange Grove Boulevard. Parsons converted its large, first-floor laundry room into a home laboratory to work on his chemical and pyrotechnic projects, homebrew absinthe and stockpile his materials. They let out the upstairs bedrooms and began holding parties that were attended largely by bohemians and members of the Beat Generation, along with old friends including Forman, Malina and Cornog. They also congregated at the home of Andrew Haley, who lived on the same street. Though Parsons in his mid-thirties was a &quot;prewar relic&quot; to the younger attendees, the raucous socials often lasted until dawn and frequently attracted police attention. Parsons also founded a new Thelemite group known as &quot;the Witchcraft&quot;, whose beliefs revolved around a simplified version of Crowley&#x27;s Thelema and Parsons&#x27; own Babalon prophecies. He offered a course in its teachings for a ten-dollar fee, which included a new Thelemic belief system called &quot;the Gnosis&quot;, a version of Christian Gnosticism with Sophia as its godhead and the Christian God as its demiurge. He also collaborated with Cameron on &quot;Songs for the Witch Woman&quot;, a collection of poems which she illustrated that was published in 2014.

===Death: 1952===
Parsons and Cameron decided to travel to Mexico for a few months, both for a vacation and for Parsons to take up a job opportunity establishing an explosives factory for the Mexican government. They hoped that this would facilitate a move to Israel, where they could start a family, and where Parsons could bypass the U.S. government to recommence his rocketry career. He was particularly disturbed by the presence of the FBI, convinced that they were spying on him.

On June 17, 1952, a day before their planned departure, Parsons received a rush order of explosives for a film set and began to work on it in his home laboratory. An explosion destroyed the lower part of the building, during which Parsons sustained mortal wounds. His right forearm was severed, his legs and left arm were broken, and a hole was torn in the right side of his face. Despite these critical injuries, Parsons was found conscious by the upstairs lodgers. He tried to communicate with the arriving ambulance workers, who rushed him to the Huntington Memorial Hospital, where he was declared dead approximately thirty-seven minutes after the explosion. When his mother, Ruth, learned of his death, she immediately took a fatal overdose of barbiturates.

Pasadena Police Department criminologist Don Harding led the official investigation; he concluded that Parsons had been mixing fulminate of mercury in a coffee can when he dropped it on the floor, causing an initial explosion that triggered a larger blast among other chemicals in the room. Forman considered this likely, stating that Parsons often had sweaty hands and could easily have dropped the can. Some of Parsons&#x27; colleagues rejected this explanation, saying that he was very attentive about safety. Two colleagues from the Bermite Powder Company described Parsons&#x27; work habits as &quot;scrupulously neat&quot; and &quot;exceptionally cautious&quot;. The latter statement—from chemical engineer George Santymers—insisted that the explosion must have come from beneath the floorboards, implying an organized plot to kill Parsons. Harding accepted that these inconsistencies were &quot;incongruous&quot; but described the manner in which Parsons had stored his chemicals as &quot;criminally negligent&quot;, and noted that Parsons had previously been investigated by the police for illegally storing chemicals at the Parsonage. He also found a morphine-filled syringe at the scene, suggesting that Parsons had been under the influence of narcotics. The police saw insufficient evidence to continue the investigation and closed the case as an accidental death.

Both Wolfe and Smith suggested that Parsons&#x27; death had been suicide, stating that he had suffered from depression for some time. Others theorized that the explosion was an assassination planned by Howard Hughes in response to Parsons&#x27; suspected theft of Hughes Aircraft Company documents. Cameron became convinced that Parsons had been murdered either by police officers seeking vengeance for his role in the conviction of Earl Kynette or by anti-Zionists opposed to his work for Israel. One of Cameron&#x27;s friends, the artist Renate Druks, later stated her belief that Parsons had died in a rite designed to create a homunculus. His death has never been definitively explained.

The immediate aftermath of the explosion attracted the interest of the U.S. media, making headline news in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. These initial reports focused on Parsons&#x27; prominence in rocketry but neglected to mention his occult interests. When asked for comment, Aerojet secretary-treasurer T.E. Beehan said that Parsons &quot;liked to wander, but he was one of the top men in the field&quot;. Within a few days, journalists had discovered his involvement in Thelema and emphasized this in their reports.

A private prayer service was held for Parsons at the funeral home where his body was cremated. Cameron scattered his ashes in the Mojave Desert, before burning most of his possessions. She later tried to perform astral projection to commune with him. The O.T.O. also held a memorial service—with attendees including Helen and Sara—at which Smith led the Gnostic Mass.

==Personal life==
===Personality===
Parsons was considered effeminate as a child; in adult life he exhibited an attitude of machismo. Jane Wolfe described him as &quot;potentially bisexual&quot; and he once expressed experiencing a latent homosexuality. The actor Paul Mathison said he had had a gay relationship with Parsons in the 1950s, though this was disputed by others who knew him and Cameron. Parsons had the reputation of being a womanizer, and was notorious for frequently flirting and having sexual liaisons with female staff members at JPL and Aerojet. He was also known for personal eccentricity such as greeting house guests with a large pet snake around his neck, driving to work in a rundown Pontiac, and using a mannequin dressed in a tuxedo with a bucket labelled &quot;The Resident&quot; as his mailbox.

As well as a fencing and archery enthusiast, Parsons was also a keen shooter; he often hunted jack rabbits and cotton tails in the desert, and was amused by mock dueling with Forman while on test sites with rifles and shotguns. Upon proposing to his first wife Helen, he gave her a pistol. Parsons enjoyed playing pranks on his colleagues, often through detonating explosives such as firecrackers and smoke bombs, and was known to spend hours at a time in the bathtub playing with toy boats while living at the Parsonage.

As well as intense bursts of creativity, Parsons suffered from what he described as &quot;manic hysteria and depressing melancholy&quot;. His father Marvel, after suffering a near-fatal heart attack, died in 1947 as a psychiatric patient at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C., diagnosed with severe clinical depression, a condition Pendle suggested the younger Parsons inherited.

===Professional associations===
Parsons&#x27; obituary listed him as a member of the Army Ordnance Association, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the American Chemical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, anddespite his lack of an academic degreethe Sigma Xi fraternity. It also stated that he had turned down several honorary degrees.

==Philosophy==
===Religious beliefs===
Parsons adhered to the occult philosophy of Thelema, which had been founded in 1904 by the English occultist Aleister Crowley following a spiritual revelation that he had in Cairo, Egypt, when—according to Crowley&#x27;s accounts—a spirit being known as Aiwass dictated to him a prophetic text known as &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;. Prior to becoming aware of Thelema and Crowley, Parsons&#x27; interest in esotericism was developed through his reading of &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; (1890), a work in comparative mythology by Scottish social anthropologist James George Frazer. Parsons had also attended lectures on Theosophy by philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti with his first wife Helen, but disliked the belief system&#x27;s sentiment of &quot;the good and the true&quot;. During rocket tests, Parsons often recited Crowley&#x27;s poem &quot;Hymn to Pan&quot; as a good luck charm. He took to addressing Crowley as his &quot;Most Beloved Father&quot; and signed off to him as &quot;thy son, John&quot;.

In July 1945, Parsons gave a speech to the Agape Lodge, in which he attempted to explain how he felt that &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; could be made relevant to &quot;modern life&quot;. In this speech, which was subsequently published under the title of &quot;Doing Your Will&quot;, he examined the Thelemite concept of True Will, writing that:

Parsons identified four obstacles that prevented humans from achieving and performing their True Will, all of which he connected with fear: the fear of incompetence, the fear of the opinion of others, the fear of hurting others, and the fear of insecurity. He insisted that these must be overcome, writing that &quot;The Will must be freed of its fetters. The ruthless examination and destruction of taboos, complexes, frustrations, dislikes, fears and disgusts hostile to the Will is essential to progress.&quot;

Though Parsons was a lifelong devotee to Thelema, he grew weary of and eventually left Ordo Templi Orientis—the religious organization that began propagating Thelema under Crowley&#x27;s leadership from the 1910s—which Parsons viewed, despite the disagreement of Crowley himself, as excessively hierarchical and impeding upon the rigorous spiritual and philosophical practice of True Will, describing the O.T.O. as &quot;an excellent training school for adepts, but hardly an appropriate Order for the manifestation of Thelema&quot;. In this sense Parsons was described by Carter as an &quot;almost fundamentalist&quot; Thelemite who placed &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;″s dogma above all other doctrine.

===Politics===
From early on in his career, Parsons took an interest in socialism and communism, views that he shared with his friend Frank Malina. Under the influence of another friend, Sidney Weinbaum, the two joined a communist group in the late 1930s, with Parsons reading Marxist literature, but he remained unconvinced and refused to join the American Communist Party. Malina asserted that this was because Parsons was a &quot;political romantic&quot;, whose attitude was more anti-authoritarian than anti-capitalist. Parsons later became critical of the Marxist–Leninist government of the Soviet Union led by Joseph Stalin, sarcastically commenting that

During the era of McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare in the early 1950s, Parsons was questioned regarding his former links to the communist movement, by which time he denied any connection to it, instead describing himself as &quot;an individualist&quot; who was both anti-communist and anti-fascist. In reaction to the McCarthyite red-baiting of scientists, he expressed disdain that

Parsons was politically influenced by Thelema, which holds to the ethical code of &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot;. In his essay, &quot;Freedom is a Lonely Star&quot;, Parsons equated this principle to the libertarian views of a number of the Founding Fathers of the United States. By his own time, he wrote, these values &quot;sold out by America, and for that reason the heart of America is sick and the soul of America is dead.&quot; He proceeded to criticize many aspects of contemporary U.S. society, particularly the police force (&quot;[t]he police mind is usually of a sadistic and homicidal trend&quot;) and note they carried out the &quot;ruthless punishment of symbolic scapegoats&quot; such as African-Americans, prostitutes, alcoholics, homeless people and sociopolitical radicals, under the pretense of a country that upheld &quot;liberty and justice for all.&quot;

To bring about a freer future, Parsons believed in liberalizing attitudes to sexual morality stating that, in his belief, the publication of the Kinsey Reports and development of the psychonautical sciences had as significant an influence on Western society as the creation of the atomic bomb and the development of nuclear physics. He believed that in the future the restrictions on sexual morality within society should be abolished in order to bring about greater freedom and individuality. Parsons concluded that

Jack Cashill, American studies professor at Purdue University, argues that &quot;Although his literary career never got much beyond pamphleteering and an untitled anti-war, anti-capitalist manuscript&quot;, Parsons played a significant role—greater than that of Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey—in shaping the Californian counterculture of the 1960s and beyond through his influence on contemporaries such as Hubbard and Heinlein. Hugh Urban, religious studies professor at Ohio State University, cites Parsons&#x27; Witchcraft group as precipitating the neopagan revival of the 1950s.

Robert Anton Wilson, a cult writer and occultist known for his works of nonfiction and science fiction, described Parsons&#x27; political writings as exemplifying an &quot;ultra-individualist&quot; who exhibited a &quot;genuine sympathy for working people&quot;, strongly empathized with feminism and held an antipathy toward patriarchy comparable to that of John Stuart Mill. Wilson argued in this context that Parsons was an influence on the American libertarian and anarchist movements of the 20th century.

Parsons was also supportive of the creation of the State of Israel. He made plans to emigrate there when his military security clearance was revoked.

==Legacy and influence==

In the decades following his death, Parsons was well-remembered among the Western esoteric community; his scientific recognition frequently amounted to a footnote. For instance, English Thelemite Kenneth Grant suggested that Parsons&#x27; Babalon Working marked the start of the appearance of flying saucers in the skies, leading to phenomena such as the Roswell UFO incident and Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting. Cameron postulated that the 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident was a spiritual reaction to Parsons&#x27; death. In 1954 she portrayed Babalon in American Thelemite Kenneth Anger&#x27;s short film &quot;Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome&quot;, viewing this cinematic depiction of a Thelemic ritual as aiding the literal invocation of Babalon begun by Parsons&#x27; working, and later said that his &quot;Book of the AntiChrist&quot; prophecies were fulfilled through the manifestation of Babalon in her person.

In December 1958, JPL was integrated into the newly established National Aeronautics and Space Administration, having built the &quot;Explorer 1&quot; satellite that commenced America&#x27;s Space Race with the Soviet Union. Aerojet was contracted by NASA to build the main engine of the Apollo Command/Service Module, and the Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System. In a letter to Frank Malina, von Kármán ranked Parsons first in a list of figures he viewed as most important to modern rocketry and the foundation of the American space program. According to Richard Metzger, Wernher von Braun—who was nicknamed &quot;The Father of Rocket Science&quot;—once argued that Parsons was more worthy of this moniker. In October 1968, Malina, a pioneer in sounding rocketry, gave a speech at JPL in which he highlighted Parsons&#x27; contribution to the U.S. rocket project, and lamented how it had come to be neglected, crediting him for making &quot;key contributions to the development of storable propellants and of long duration solid propellant agents that play such an important role in American and European space technology.&quot;

The same month, JPL held an open access event to mark the 32nd anniversary of its foundation—which featured a &quot;nativity scene&quot; of mannequins reconstructing the November 1936 photograph of the GALCIT Group—and erected a monument commemorating their first rocket test on Halloween 1936. Among the aerospace industry, JPL was nicknamed as standing for &quot;Jack Parsons&#x27; Laboratory&quot; or &quot;Jack Parsons Lives&quot;. The International Astronomical Union decided to name a crater on the far side of the Moon Parsons after him in 1972. JPL later credited him for making &quot;distinctive technical innovations that advanced early efforts&quot; in rocket engineering, with aerospace journalist Craig Covault stating that the work of Parsons, Qian Xuesen and the GALCIT Group &quot;planted the seeds for JPL to become preeminent in space and rocketry.&quot;

Many of Parsons&#x27; writings were posthumously published as &quot;Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword&quot; in 1989, a compilation co-edited by Cameron and O.T.O. leader Hymenaeus Beta, which incited a resurgence of interest in Parsons within occult and countercultural circles. For example, comic book artist and occultist Alan Moore noted Parsons as a creative influence in a 1998 interview with Clifford Meth. The Cameron-Parsons Foundation was founded as an incorporated company in 2006, with the intention of conserving and promoting Parsons&#x27; writings and Cameron&#x27;s artwork, and in 2014 Fulger Esoterica published &quot;Songs for the Witch Woman&quot;—a limited edition book of poems by Parsons with illustrations by Cameron, released to coincide with his centenary. An exhibition of the same name was held at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.

In 1999, Feral House published the biography &quot;Sex and Rockets: The Occult World of Jack Parsons&quot; by John Carter, who opined that Parsons had accomplished more in under five years of research than Robert H. Goddard had in his lifetime, and said that his role in the development of rocket technology had been neglected by historians of science; Carter thought that Parsons&#x27; abilities and accomplishments as an occultist had been overestimated and exaggerated among Western esotericists, emphasizing his disowning by Crowley for practicing magic beyond his grade. Feral House republished the work as a new edition in 2004, accompanied with an introduction by Robert Anton Wilson. Wilson believed that Parsons was &quot;the one single individual who contributed the most to rocket science&quot;, describing him as being &quot;very strange, very brilliant, very funny, [and] very tormented&quot;, and considering it noteworthy that the day of Parsons&#x27; birth was the predicted beginning of the apocalypse advocated by Charles Taze Russell, the founder of the Bible Student movement.

In 2005, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson published &quot;Strange Angel: The Otherworldly Life of Rocket Scientist John Whiteside Parsons&quot; by George Pendle, who described Parsons as &quot;the Che Guevara of occultism&quot;. Pendle said that although Parsons &quot;would not live to see his dream of space travel come true, he was essential to making it a reality.&quot; Pendle considered that the cultural stigma attached to Parsons&#x27; occultism was the primary cause of his low public profile, noting that &quot;Like many scientific mavericks, Parsons was eventually discarded by the establishment once he had served his purpose.&quot; It was this unorthodox mindset, creatively facilitated by his science fiction fandom and &quot;willingness to believe in magic&#x27;s efficacy&quot;, Pendle argued, &quot;that allowed him to break scientific barriers previously thought to be indestructible&quot;—commenting that Parsons &quot;saw both space and magic as ways of exploring these new frontiers—one breaking free from Earth literally and metaphysically.&quot;

L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s role in Parsons&#x27; Agape Lodge and the ensuing yacht scam were explored in Russell Miller&#x27;s 1987 Hubbard biography &quot;Bare-faced Messiah&quot;. Parsons&#x27; involvement in the Agape Lodge was also discussed by Martin P. Starr in his history of the American Thelemite movement, &quot;The Unknown God: W.T. Smith and the Thelemites&quot;, published by Teitan Press in 2003. &quot;The QI Book of the Dead&quot; (2004), based on the BBC game show, included a Parsons obituary. Parsons&#x27; occult partnership with Hubbard was also mentioned in Alex Gibney&#x27;s 2015 documentary film &quot;Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief&quot;, produced by HBO.

Before his death, Parsons appeared in science fiction writer Anthony Boucher&#x27;s murder-mystery novel &quot;Rocket to the Morgue&quot; (1942) under the guise of mad scientist character Hugo Chantrelle. Another fictional character based on Parsons was Courtney James, a wealthy socialite who features in L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s 1956 short time travel story &quot;A Gun for Dinosaur&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Pasadena Babalon&quot;, a stage play about Parsons written by George D. Morgan and directed by Brian Brophy, premiered at Caltech as a production by its theater Arts Group in 2010, the same year Cellar Door Publishing released Richard Carbonneau and Robin Simon Ng&#x27;s graphic novel, &quot;The Marvel: A Biography of Jack Parsons&quot;.

Parsons&#x27; mythology was incorporated into the narrative of David Lynch&#x27;s mystery-horror television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. In 2014, AMC Networks announced plans for a serial television dramatization of Parsons&#x27; life, but in 2016 it was reported that the series &quot;will not be going forward.&quot; In 2017, the project was adopted as a web television series by CBS All Access. &quot;Strange Angel&quot;, produced by Mark Heyman and starring Irish actor Jack Reynor as Parsons, premiered in June 2018 and ran for two seasons. Parsons appears as a side character in China Miéville&#x27;s 2016 fantastical novella, The Last Days of New Paris. In 2018, Parsons was featured in an episode of the Amazon series &quot;Lore&quot;.

Parsons is the subject of musical tributes by Johan Johannson (&quot;Fordlandia&quot;, 2008), Six Organs of Admittance (&quot;Parsons&#x27; Blues&quot;, 2012), The Claypool Lennon Delirium (&quot;South of Reality&quot;, 2019), and Luke Haines and Peter Buck (&quot;Beat Poetry for Survivalists&quot;, 2020).
