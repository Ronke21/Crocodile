<text>Sir Samuel Cunard, 1st Baronet (21 November 1787 – 28 April 1865), was a British-Canadian shipping magnate, born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who founded the Cunard Line, establishing the first scheduled steamship connection with North America. He was the son of a master carpenter and timber merchant who had fled the American Revolution and settled in Halifax.

==Family and early life==

Samuel Cunard was the second son of Abraham Cunard (1756–1824), a Quaker and Margaret Murphy (1758–1821), a Roman Catholic. The Cunards were a Quaker family that originally came from Worcestershire, in Britain, but were forced to flee to Germany in the 17th century due to religious persecution, where they took the name Kunder. Samuel Cunard&#x27;s great-great-grandfather had been a dyer in Crefeld there, but emigrated to Pennsylvania in 1683. In America they adopted the name Cunard. Later some of his descendants, including his grandfather, Samuel, changed their name to Cunard. Abraham Cunard was a Loyalist to the British Crown and moved to Halifax in 1783, after the American Revolution. He married Margaret Murphy, another Loyalist émigrée that year. Margaret&#x27;s family were originally from Ireland and came to Halifax from South Carolina. Abraham and Margaret had nine children, two girls and seven boys (William 1789–1823, Samuel 1787–1865, Edward 1798–1851, Joseph 1799–1865, John, Thomas and Henry).

Abraham Cunard was a master carpenter who worked for the British garrison in Halifax and became a wealthy landowner and timber merchant. Margaret Cunard&#x27;s alcoholism spurred Samuel Cunard to assume responsibilities at an early age. Samuel Cunard&#x27;s own business skills were evident early in his teens: he was managing his own general store from stock he obtained in broken lots at wharf auction. He later joined his father in the family timber business, which expanded into investments in shipping.

==Adulthood and career==
During the War of 1812, Cunard volunteered for service in the 2nd Battalion of the Halifax Regiment militia and rose to the rank of captain. He held many public offices, such as volunteer fireman and lighthouse commissioner, and maintained a reputation as not only a shrewd businessman, but also an honest and generous citizen.

Cunard was a highly successful entrepreneur in Halifax shipping and one of a group of twelve individuals who dominated the affairs of Nova Scotia. He secured mail packet contracts and provided a fisheries patrol vessel for the province. Cunard diversified his family&#x27;s timber and shipping business with investments in whaling, tea imports and coal mining, as well as the Halifax Banking Company and the Shubenacadie Canal. The whaling ships, sent far into the Southern Atlantic, seldom if ever turned a profit. He purchased large amounts of land in Prince Edward Island, at one point owning a seventh of the province, which involved him in the protracted disputes between tenants on the island and the absentee landlords who owned most of it.

===Steamships===

Cunard experimented with steam, cautiously at first, becoming a founding director of the Halifax Steamboat Company, which built the first steamship in Nova Scotia in 1830, the long-serving and successful SS &quot;Sir Charles Ogle&quot; for the Halifax–Dartmouth Ferry Service. The first steam boat had already been built by Aaron Manby in 1822. Cunard became president of the company in 1836 and arranged for steam power for their second ferry, &quot;Boxer&quot; in 1838. Cunard led Halifax investors to combine with Quebec business in 1831 to build the pioneering ocean steamship to run between Quebec and Halifax. Although &quot;Royal William&quot; ran into problems after losing an entire season due to cholera quarantines, Cunard learned valuable lessons about steamship operation. He commissioned a coastal steamship named &quot;Pochohontas&quot; in 1832 for mail service to Prince Edward Island and later purchased a larger steamship &quot;Cape Breton&quot; to expand the service.

Cunard&#x27;s experience in steamship operation, with observations of the growing railway network in England, encouraged him to explore the creation of a Transatlantic fleet of steamships, which would cross the ocean as regularly as trains crossed land. He went to the United Kingdom seeking investors in 1837. He set up a company with several other businessmen to bid for the rights to run a transatlantic mail service between the UK and North America. It was successful in its bid, the company later becoming Cunard Steamships Limited. 
In 1840 the company&#x27;s first steamship, the , sailed from Liverpool to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and on to Boston, Massachusetts, with Cunard and 63 other passengers on board, marking the beginning of regular passenger and cargo service. Establishing a long unblemished reputation for speed and safety, Cunard&#x27;s company made ocean liners a success, in the face of many potential rivals who lost ships and fortunes. Cunard&#x27;s ships proved successful, but their high costs saddled Cunard with heavy debts by 1842, and he had to flee to England from creditors in Halifax. However, by 1843, Cunard ships were earning enough to pay off his debts and begin issuing modest but growing dividends. Cunard divided his time between Nova Scotia and England but increasingly left his Nova Scotian operations in the hands of his sons Edward and William, as business drew him to spend more time in London.

Cunard made a special trip to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in 1850, when his brother Joseph Cunard&#x27;s timber and shipping businesses in New Brunswick collapsed in a bankruptcy that threw as many as 1000 people out of work. Cunard took out loans and personally guaranteed all of his brother&#x27;s debts in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Boston. Joseph Cunard moved to Liverpool, England where Samuel helped him re-establish his shipping interests.

===Personal views===
Cunard throughout his personal life was not a religious man and was considered by many to be agnostic. On his deathbed, Cunard declined last rites and declared he &quot;did not feel and admit and believe.&quot; His views on slavery in the 19th century were not known, but his statements regarding Frederick Douglass&#x27;s segregated passage arranged by a Cunard Agent in Liverpool on one of his ocean liners in 1845 strongly suggests he was against any form of racial prejudice. &quot;No one can regret more than I do the unpleasant circumstances surrounding Mr. Douglass&#x27;s passage from Liverpool, but I can assure you that nothing of the kind will again take place on the steamships in which I am connected.&quot; His views on race reflected those of Britons of the time, who regarded mistreatment of black people as a moral wrong, even though they still considered them to be socially and intellectually inferior to white people.

==Later life==

Cunard owned a number of companies in Canada. After his death and changes to the British mail contract, his partners in England dropped his Canadian service and it was 50 years before his ships returned to Canada. His coal company in Nova Scotia, which he bought to fuel his liners, remained the family&#x27;s major investment in Nova Scotia and continued into the 20th century as Cunard Fuels, later bought out by the Irving Family of New Brunswick.

In 1859 Cunard was made a baronet by Queen Victoria.

Sir Samuel Cunard died at Kensington in London on 28 April 1865. He is buried at Brompton Cemetery in London. He lies against the eastern wall.

==Legacy==

At the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, a substantial portion of the second floor is dedicated to his life, the Cunard Line and its famous ships. A large bronze statue of Samuel Cunard was erected in October 2006 on the Halifax waterfront, beside the Ocean Terminal Wharves long used by Cunard&#x27;s liners. A stamp of Cunard&#x27;s likeness was issued by Canada Post in 2004.

Despite challenges from competing companies and changes in technology, the prosperous company grew, eventually absorbed many others such as the Canadian Northern Steamships Limited, and in 1934 its principal competition, the White Star Line, owners of the successful and former owners of the ill-fated . After that, Cunard dominated the Atlantic passenger trade with some of the world&#x27;s most famous liners such as the and . His name lives on today in the Cunard Line, now a prestigious branch of the Carnival Line cruise empire.

==Family==

Samuel Cunard was married to Susan, daughter of William Duffus, a dry goods merchant, on 4 February 1815, by whom he had nine children, two sons (Edward 1816–1869 and William 1825–1906) and seven daughters (Mary 1817–1885, Susan 1819–, Margaret Ann 1820–1901, Sarah Jane 1821–1902, Ann Elizabeth 1823–1862, Isabella 1827–1894 and Elizabeth 1828–1889. On 28 February 1828, Susan Cunard died due to complications after Elizabeth&#x27;s birth. Cunard never remarried, confiding on his deathbed to his sons that he had &quot;been dreaming about your dear mother...and what a good woman she was.&quot;

Sir Samuel Cunard was succeeded in both the business and the baronetcy by his oldest son, Sir Edward Cunard, 2nd baronet, who married Mary Bache McEvers (daughter of Bache McEvers), and through whom the baronetcy was passed down. Their son, Bache Edward Cunard, 3rd baronet married the society hostess Emerald, Lady Cunard (1872–1948). They in turn had one daughter, Nancy Cunard (1896–1965), writer, heiress and political activist.

William Cunard, second son of Sir Samuel Cunard, married Laura Charlotte Haliburton, daughter of author and politician Thomas Chandler Haliburton. The couple had three sons and one daughter. William built the Halifax School for the Deaf. Samuel Cunard&#x27;s daughter Margaret married William Leigh Mellish (1813–1864), soldier, landowner and cricketer.

<doc id="95410" wikidata="Q299073" url="?curid=95410" title="Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan">
<text>Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan (, ; born Pervez Fateh Ali Khan; 13 October 1948 – 16 August 1997), also known by his initials NFAK, was a Pakistani singer, songwriter, and music director. Ustad was primarily a singer of qawwali, a form of Sufi devotional music. Often referred to as the &quot;Shahenshah-e-Qawwali&quot; (the King of Kings of Qawwali), he has been recognized as one of the 50 Great Voices by NPR and 200 Greatest Singers of All Time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; named Khan the greatest qawwali singer of his generation. Credited with introducing Qawwali music to international audiences, he was known for his vocal abilities and could perform at a high level of intensity for several hours.

Born in Lyallpur, West Punjab, Khan had his first public performance at the age of 15 at his father&#x27;s &quot;chelum&quot;. He became the head of the family qawwali party in 1971 and brought his unique style of sargam, khayal, and rhythm to his family&#x27;s legacy. He was signed by Oriental Star Agencies, Birmingham, England, in the early 1980s. Khan went on to release movie scores and albums in Europe, India, Japan, Pakistan, and the U.S. He engaged in collaborations and experiments with Western artists, becoming a well-known world music artist. He toured extensively, performing in over 40 countries. In addition to popularising qawwali music, he also had a profound impact on contemporary South Asian popular music, including Pakistani pop, Indian pop, and Bollywood music. He was also a master of Hindustani classical music.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===

Khan was born into a Punjabi Muslim family in Lyallpur (present-day Faisalabad) in West Punjab in 1948. Khan&#x27;s family belonged to Jalandhar; his ancestors had emigrated to Basti Sheikh Darvesh in Jalandhar at the end of the 12th century. His ancestors learned music and singing there and adopted it as a profession. He was the fifth child and first son of Fateh Ali Khan, a musicologist, vocalist, instrumentalist, and qawwal. Khan&#x27;s family, which included four older sisters and a younger brother, Farrukh Fateh Ali Khan, grew up in central Faisalabad. The tradition of qawwali in the family has been passed down through successive generations for almost 600 years. Initially, his father did not want Khan to follow the family&#x27;s vocation. He had his heart set on Nusrat choosing a much more respectable career path and becoming a doctor or engineer because he felt qawwali artists had low social status. However, Khan showed such an aptitude for and interest in qawwali, that his father finally relented.

=== Early career ===

A young Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan joined his father’s qawwali party initially as a tabla player whilst continuing to learn the intricacies of singing. In 1964, after the death of his father Fateh Ali Khan, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan became the lead singer of the qawwali party alongside his uncle Mubarak Ali Khan. The party also included Mujahid Mubarak Ali Khan, the son of Mubarak Ali Khan and the cousin of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. After the death of Mubarak Ali Khan in 1971, the party became known as &quot;Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Mujahid Mubarak Ali Khan &amp; Party.&quot; As Nusrat’s prominence grew, the party eventually becoming recognized as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan &amp; Party. One of Khan&#x27;s earliest public performances as leader of the family qawwali group was in March 1965, at a studio recording broadcast as part of an annual music festival organized by Radio Pakistan, known as &quot;Jashn-e-Baharan&quot;. The 1965 &quot;Jashn-e-Baharan&quot; performance drew praise from legends such as Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Ustad Umid Ali Khan, Roshan Ara Begum, and Ustad Amanat Ali Khan. Khan sang mainly in Urdu and Punjabi and occasionally in Persian, Braj Bhasha, and Hindi. Among Khan’s first major hits in Pakistan was the punjabi qawwali ‘&quot;Ni Main Jana Jogi De Naal’&quot; which he composed and first performed live in 1971, with a studio version subsequently recorded in 1973. The lyrics to &quot;Ni Main Jana Jogi De Naal’&quot; were written by Bulleh Shah, a 17th century Sufi poet. Another of Khan&#x27;s early hits in Pakistan was the qawaali &#x27;&quot;Haq Ali Ali&quot;&#x27; which featured restrained use of his sargam improvisations.

===1980s===

In the summer of 1985, Khan performed at the World of Music, Arts and Dance (WOMAD) festival in London. He performed in Paris in 1985 and 1988. He first visited Japan in 1987 at the invitation of the Japan Foundation. He performed at the 5th Asian Traditional Performing Art Festival in Japan. He also performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, in 1989, earning him admiration from the American audience.

In 1988, Khan teamed up with Peter Gabriel on the soundtrack to &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;, which led to Khan being signed to Gabriel&#x27;s Real World label.

In 1989, commissioned by Oriental Star Agencies Ltd in Birmingham, UK, Khan collaborated at Zella Recording Studios with composer Andrew Kristy and producer Johnny Haynes on a series of &#x27;fusion&#x27; tracks that propelled Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Party into the Channel 4 Christmas Special of &quot;Big World Café.&quot; While in the UK in 1989, Khan and his party performed Sikh devotional music at a Sikh Gurdwara in Slough, continuing a tradition of Muslims performing hymns at Sikh temples.

=== 1990s ===

Following this, in 1990, the BBC devoted a programme of its series &quot;Network East&quot; to this collaboration, and Big World Café invited Khan, Andrew Kristy, and violinist Nigel Kennedy to perform Allah Hoo live on the show. A UK tour performing these new fusion tracks happened in 1990.

In the 1992 -1993 academic year, Khan was a visiting artist in the Ethnomusicology department at the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States.

Khan released five albums of traditional qawwali through Real World, along with the more experimental albums &quot;Mustt Mustt&quot; (1990), &quot;Night Song&quot; (1996), and the posthumous remix album &quot;Star Rise&quot; (1997). Khan&#x27;s experimental work for Real World, which featured his collaborations with the Canadian guitarist Michael Brook, led to several further collaborations with other Western composers and rock musicians. One of these collaborations occurred in 1995, when Khan teamed up with Pearl Jam&#x27;s lead singer Eddie Vedder on two songs for the soundtrack to &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;. Khan also provided vocals for &quot;The Prayer Cycle&quot;, which was put together by Jonathan Elias, but died before the tracks could be completed. Alanis Morissette was brought in to sing alongside his unfinished vocals. In 2002, Gabriel included Khan&#x27;s vocals on the track &quot;Signal to Noise&quot; on his album &quot;Up&quot;.

Khan was the main performer at Imran Khan&#x27;s charity appeal concert at the InterContinental London Park Lane Hotel on December 3, 1992 to raise funds for Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, a cancer hospital built in Imran&#x27;s mother&#x27;s name which provides free services. The audience included Peter Gabriel, Elizabeth Hurley, Mick Jagger, and Amitabh Bachchan.

Khan&#x27;s album &quot;Intoxicated Spirit&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album in 1997. That same year, his album &quot;Night Song&quot; was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best World Music Album.

Khan contributed the song &quot;Gurus of Peace&quot; to the 1997 album &quot;Vande Mataram&quot;, composed by A. R. Rahman, and released to celebrate the 50th anniversary of India&#x27;s independence. As a posthumous tribute, Rahman later released an album titled &quot;Gurus of Peace&quot; which included &quot;Allah Hoo&quot; by Khan. Rahman&#x27;s 2007 song &quot;Tere Bina&quot; for the film &quot;Guru&quot; was also composed as a tribute to Khan.

Khan contributed songs to, and performed in, several Pakistani films. Shortly before his death, he composed music for three Bollywood films, which include the film &quot;Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya&quot;, in which he also sang &quot;Koi Jaane Koi Na Jaane&quot; on-screen with the lead pair, and &quot;Zindagi Jhoom Kar.&quot; He also composed music for &quot;Kartoos&quot;, where he sang for &quot;Ishq Da Rutba&quot; and &quot;Bahaa Na Aansoo&quot; alongside Udit Narayan. He died shortly before the movie&#x27;s release. His final music composition for Bollywood was for the movie &quot;Kachche Dhaage&quot;, where he sang &quot;Iss Shaan-E-Karam Ka Kya Kehna.&quot; The movie was released in 1999, two years after his death. Asha Bhosle and Lata Mangeshkar performed the songs he composed in his brief stint in Bollywood. He also sang &quot;Saya Bhi Saath Jab Chhod Jaye&quot; for Sunny Deol&#x27;s movie &quot;Dillagi&quot;. The song was released in 1999, two years after Khan&#x27;s death. He also sang &quot;Dulhe Ka Sehra&quot; from the Bollywood movie &quot;Dhadkan&quot; ,which was released in 2000.

==Death==

Khan had been seriously ill for several months, according to a spokesperson at his U.S. label, American Recordings. After traveling to London for treatment for liver and kidney problems, he was rushed from the airport to the Cromwell Hospital, where he died of a sudden cardiac arrest on 16 August 1997, aged 48. His body was repatriated to Faisalabad, and his funeral was a public affair. His wife, Naheed Nusrat, moved to Canada after the death of her husband, where she died on 13 September 2013 in Mississauga, Ontario. Khan&#x27;s musical legacy is now carried forward by his nephews, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and Rizwan-Muazzam.

==Awards and titles==

Khan is widely considered to be the most important qawwal in history. In 1987, he received the President of Pakistan&#x27;s Award for Pride of Performance for his contribution to Pakistani music. In 1995, he received the UNESCO Music Prize. In 1996 he was awarded Grand Prix des Amériques at Montreal World Film Festival for exceptional contribution to the art of cinema. In the same year, Khan received the Arts and Culture Prize of the Fukuoka Asian Culture Prizes. In Japan, he was also remembered as the Budai or &quot;Singing Buddha.&quot;

In 1997, he was nominated for two Grammy Awards, for Best Traditional Folk Album and Best World Music Album. In 1998, he was awarded PTV Life Time Achievement Award. As of 2001, he held the Guinness World Record for the &quot;Most Qawwali Recordings&quot;, having recorded over 125 qawwali albums before his death. In 2005, Khan posthumously received the &quot;Legends&quot; award at the UK Asian Music Awards. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s issue of 6 November 2006, &quot;60 Years of Asian Heroes&quot;, lists him as one of the top 12 artists and thinkers in the last 60 years. He also appeared on NPR&#x27;s 50 great voices list in 2010. In August 2010 he was included in CNN&#x27;s list of the twenty most iconic musicians from the past fifty years. In 2008, Khan was listed in 14th position in UGO&#x27;s list of the best singers of all time.

Many honorary titles were bestowed upon Khan during his 25-year music career. He was given the title of Ustad (the master) after performing classical music at a function in Lahore on the anniversary of his father&#x27;s death.

Khan was listed at position 91 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 200 Best Singers Of All Time list, which was published on 1 January 2023.

He was called the ‘Singing Buddha&#x27; in Tokyo, ‘The Voice of Paradise&#x27; in Los Angeles, ‘Quintessence of the Human Voice&#x27; in Tunis, ‘The Spirit of Islam&#x27; in London, ‘Pavarotti of the East&#x27; in Paris, ‘Emperor of Qawwali&#x27; (Shahenshah - e - Qawwali) in Lahore.

==Tributes, legacy and influence==

Khan is often credited as one of the progenitors of &quot;world music.&quot; Widely acclaimed for his spiritual charisma and distinctive exuberance, he was one of the first and most important artists to popularize qawwali, then considered an &quot;arcane religious tradition&quot;, to Western audiences. His powerful vocal presentations, which could last up to 10 hours, brought forth a craze for his music all over Europe. Alexandra A. Seno of &quot;Asiaweek&quot; wrote:

Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan&#x27;s voice was otherworldly. For 25 years, his mystical songs transfixed millions. It was not long enough ... He performed qawwali, which means wise or philosophical utterance, as nobody else of his generation did. His vocal range, talent for improvisation and sheer intensity were unsurpassed.

Jeff Buckley cited Khan as a major influence, saying of him &quot;He&#x27;s my Elvis&quot;, and performing the first few minutes of Khan&#x27;s &quot;Yeh Jo Halka Halka Suroor Hai&quot; (including vocals) at live concerts. Many other artists have also cited Khan as an influence, such as Nadia Ali, Zayn Malik, Malay, Peter Gabriel, A. R. Rahman, Sheila Chandra, Alim Qasimov, Eddie Vedder, and Joan Osborne, among others. His music was also appreciated by singers such as Mick Jagger, socialites such as Parmeshwar Godrej, actors such as Amitabh Bachchan, Trudie Styler, Sean Penn, Susan Sarandon, and Tim Robbins, and authors such as Sam Harris, who cited Khan as one of his favourite musicians.

Paul Williams picked a concert performance by Khan for inclusion in his 2000 book &quot;The 20th Century&#x27;s Greatest Hits: a &#x27;top-40&#x27; list&quot;, in which he devotes a chapter each to what he considers the top 40 artistic achievements of the 20th century in any field (including art, movies, music, fiction, non-fiction, science-fiction). The Derek Trucks Band covers Khan&#x27;s songs on two of their studio albums. Their 2002 album &quot;Joyful Noise&quot; includes a cover of &quot;Maki Madni&quot;, which features a guest performance by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Khan&#x27;s nephew. 2005&#x27;s &quot;Songlines&quot; includes a medley of two of Khan&#x27;s songs, &quot;Sahib Teri Bandi&quot; and &quot;Maki Madni.&quot; This medley first appeared on the band&#x27;s live album &quot;Live at Georgia Theatre&quot; (2004).

In 2004, a tribute band called Brooklyn Qawwali Party (formerly Brook&#x27;s Qawwali Party) was formed in New York City by percussionist Brook Martinez to perform the music of Khan. The 13-piece group still performs mostly instrumental jazz versions of Khan&#x27;s qawwalis, using the instruments conventionally associated with jazz rather than those associated with qawwali.

In 2007, electronic music producer and performer Gaudi, after being granted access to back catalogue recordings from Rehmat Gramophone House (Khan&#x27;s former label in Pakistan), released an album of entirely new songs composed around existing vocals. The album, &quot;Dub Qawwali&quot;, was released by Six Degrees Records. It reached no. 2 in the iTunes US Chart, no. 4 in the UK and was the no. 1 seller in Amazon.com&#x27;s Electronic Music section for a period. It also earned Gaudi a nomination for the BBC&#x27;s World Music Awards 2008.

On 13 October 2015, Google celebrated Khan&#x27;s 67th birthday with a doodle on its homepage in six countries, including India, Pakistan, Japan, Sweden, Ghana, and Kenya, calling him the person &quot;who opened the world&#x27;s ears to the rich, hypnotic sounds of the Sufis.&quot; &quot;Thanks to his legendary voice, Khan helped bring &#x27;world music&#x27; to the world,&quot; said Google.

In February 2016, a rough mix of a song recorded by Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1998 called &quot;Circle of the Noose&quot; was leaked to the internet. Guitarist Dave Navarro described the song saying, &quot;It&#x27;s pop in the sense of verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, hook. I really love it and we use a loop of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. It&#x27;s really nice. The best way I can describe it is it&#x27;s like pepped- up &#x27;60s folk with &#x27;90s ideals, but I would hate to label it as folk because it&#x27;s not, it moves.&quot;

The 2018 book &quot;The Displaced Children of Displaced Children&quot; (Eyewear Publishing) by Pakistani American poet Faisal Mohyuddin includes the poem &quot;Faisalabad&quot;, a tribute to Khan and to the city of Khan&#x27;s birth. &quot;Faisalabad&quot; includes a number or references to Khan, including the excerpt, &quot;There are no better cures for homesickness / than Nusrat&#x27;s qawwalis, / except when you&#x27;re a mother / and you find comfort in the unfolding / hours of a child&#x27;s existence.&quot; The poem was first published by &quot;Narrative Magazine&quot; in Spring 2017.

===Popular culture===

One of Khan&#x27;s famous qawwali songs, &quot;Tere Bin Nahin Lagda&quot; (&quot;I am restless without you&quot;), appeared on two of his 1996 albums, &quot;Sorrows Vol. 69&quot; and &quot;Sangam&quot; (as &quot;Tere Bin Nahin Lagda Dil&quot;), the latter a collaborative album with Indian lyricist Javed Akhtar; &quot;Sangam&quot; sold over 1million copies in India. Lata Mangeshkar recorded a cover version called &quot;Tere Bin Nahin Jeena&quot; for &quot;Kachche Dhaage&quot;, starring Ajay Devgn, Saif Ali Khan and Manisha Koirala. Composed by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, the &quot;Kachche Dhaage&quot; soundtrack album sold 3million units in India. British-Indian producer Bally Sagoo released a remix of &quot;Tere Bin Nahin Lagda&quot;, which was later featured in the 2002 British film &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot;, starring Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley. A cover version called &quot;Tere Bin&quot; was recorded by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan with Asees Kaur for the 2018 Bollywood film &quot;Simmba&quot;, starring Ranveer Singh and Sara Ali Khan.

Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan&#x27;s music had a big impact on Bollywood music, inspiring numerous Indian musicians working in Bollywood since the late 1980s. For example, he inspired A. R. Rahman and Javed Akhtar, both of whom he collaborated with. However, there were many hit filmi songs from other Indian music directors that plagiarised Khan&#x27;s music. For example, Viju Shah&#x27;s hit song &quot;Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast Mast&quot; in &quot;Mohra&quot; (1994) was plagiarised from Khan&#x27;s popular qawwali song &quot;Dam Mast Qalandar.&quot;

Despite the significant number of hit Bollywood songs plagiarised from his music, he was reportedly tolerant towards the plagiarism. In one interview, he jokingly gave &quot;Best Copy&quot; awards to Viju Shah and Anu Malik. In his defense, Malik claimed that he loved Khan&#x27;s music and was actually showing admiration by using his tunes. However, Khan was reportedly aggrieved when Malik turned his spiritual &quot;Allah Hoo, Allah Hoo&quot; into &quot;I Love You, I Love You&quot; in &quot;Auzaar&quot;. Khan said &quot;he has taken my devotional song &quot;Allahu&quot; and converted it into &quot;I love you&quot;. He should at least respect my religious songs.&quot;

His music also appears on soundtracks for Hollywood films such as &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988), &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; (1994), and &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; (1995).

<text>Gnocchi ( , ; ; : gnocco) are a varied family of dumplings in Italian cuisine. They are made of small rolls of dough, such as those composed of a simple combination of wheat flour, potato, egg, and salt. Variations of the dish supplement the simple recipe with flavour additives, such as semolina flour, cheese, breadcrumbs, cornmeal or similar ingredients, and possibly including herbs, vegetables, and other ingredients. Base ingredients may be substituted with alternatives such as sweet potatoes for potatoes or rice flour for wheat flour. Such variations are often considered to be non-traditional.
Gnocchi are commonly cooked in salted boiling water and then dressed with various sauces. They are usually eaten as a first course () as an alternative to soups () or pasta, but they can also be served as a contorno (side dish) to some main courses. Common accompaniments of gnocchi include melted butter with sage, pesto, and various sauces. Gnocchi may be homemade, made by specialty stores, or produced industrially and distributed refrigerated, dried, or frozen. Small soup gnocchi are sometimes made by pressing the dough through a coarse sieve or a perforated spoon.

==Origin==

The word may be derived from the Italian word , meaning &#x27;a knot in wood&#x27;, or from , meaning &#x27;knuckle&#x27;. It has been a traditional Italian dish since Roman times. It was introduced by the Roman legions during the expansion of the empire into the countries of the European continent. One ancient Roman recipe consists of a semolina porridge-like dough mixed with eggs; similar modern dishes include the baked and Sardinian , which do not contain eggs.

After potatoes were introduced to Europe, they were eventually incorporated into gnocchi recipes. Potato gnocchi are particularly popular in Lombardy, Abruzzo, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Veneto, and Lazio.

==Ingredients and preparation==
Ingredients typically include wheat flour, potato, egg, and salt. Variations of the dish supplement the simple recipe with flavour additives, such as semolina flour, cheese, breadcrumbs, cornmeal or similar ingredients, and possibly including herbs, vegetables, and other ingredients.

The dough for gnocchi is often rolled out before it is cut into small pieces about the size of a wine cork or smaller. The dumplings may be pressed with a textured object, such as a fork or a cheese grater, to make ridges or cut into little lumps. Professional tools exist for this purpose, known as gnocchi or boards.

Gnocchi that are homemade are usually consumed the same day they are made. However, they can be cut into bite-sized dumplings, spread evenly on a baking sheet, frozen, then packaged in an air-tight bag and back into the freezer for later consumption. This method can allow the gnocchi to last two months in the freezer.

Commercial gnocchi are often sold under modified atmospheric packaging and may achieve a shelf life of two weeks or more under refrigeration. Some are sold in vacuum packaging that is shelf-stable, only needing refrigeration once it is opened.

==Varieties==
Gnocchi vary in recipe and name across different regions.

===Regional===
Lombard and Tuscan () are made with ricotta, flour, and spinach, as well as the addition of various other herbs if required. Tuscan distinctively contains less flour; but some varieties are flour-based, such as the Campanian , the Apulian , the Sardinian , and so on. Certain kinds are made of cooked polenta or semolina, which is spread out to dry, layered with cheese and butter, and baked.

 (), derived from the , is made from breadcrumbs and is popular in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Veneto, and Trentino-Alto Adige. Another variety from the latter region is spinach gnocchi.

===International===

====Austria====
In Austria, gnocchi are a common main or side dish, known by the original name and Austrian variant, &quot;nockerl&quot; (: &quot;nockerln&quot;). As a side dish, they may accompany main dishes such as goulash.

====Croatia====
Gnocchi are very popular and often served as a dish in coastal Croatia, typically being served as a first course or a side dish with &quot;dalmatinska pašticada&quot;. The Croatian name for gnocchi is &quot;njoki&quot;.

====Slovenia====

A specialty of Nice, or are made with potatoes, wheat flour, and eggs. Another version including (Swiss chard) is called ().

In Provence, potato gnocchi can be made in a longer shape called .

====South America====
Due to the significant number of Italian immigrants who arrived in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, gnocchi, &quot;ñoqui&quot; (), or (), is a popular dish, even in areas with few Italian immigrants. In Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina, there is a tradition of eating gnocchi on the 29th of each month, with some people putting money beneath their plates to bring prosperity. Indeed, in Argentina and Uruguay &quot;ñoqui&quot; is slang for a bogus employee (according to corrupt accountancy practices or, in the public sector, the distribution of political patronage), who only turns up at the end of the month to receive their salary.

<text>The Neckar () is a river in Germany, mainly flowing through the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg, with a short section through Hesse. The Neckar is a major right tributary of the Rhine. Rising in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis near Schwenningen in the &quot;Schwenninger Moos&quot; conservation area at a height of above sea level, it passes through Rottweil, Rottenburg am Neckar, Kilchberg, Tübingen, Wernau, Nürtingen, Plochingen, Esslingen, Stuttgart, Ludwigsburg, Marbach, Heilbronn and Heidelberg, before discharging on average of water into the Rhine at Mannheim, at above sea level, making the Neckar its 4th largest tributary, and the 10th largest river in Germany. Since 1968, the Neckar has been navigable for cargo ships via 27 locks for about upstream from Mannheim to the river port of Plochingen, at the confluence with the Fils.

From Plochingen to Stuttgart, the Neckar valley is densely populated and heavily industrialised, with several well-known companies. Between Stuttgart and Lauffen, the Neckar cuts a scenic, meandering, and in many places steep-sided, valley into fossiliferous Triassic limestones and Pleistocene travertine. Along the Neckar&#x27;s valley in the Odenwald hills many castles can be found, including Hornberg Castle and in Haßmersheim; the now-mothballed Obrigheim Nuclear Power Plant and the active Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant are also located there.


Traditionally the fertile plains have been intensively used for agriculture and its steep valley sides as vineyards.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Neckar&quot; may be derived from &quot;Nicarus&quot; and &quot;Neccarus&quot; from Celtic &quot;Nikros&quot;, meaning &quot;wild water&quot; or &quot;wild fellow&quot;. The grammatical gender of the name in German is masculine (der Neckar).

== Geography ==

=== River course ===
Drainage area
==== Sources ====
The headwater region of the Neckar lies in the Schwenninger Moos between Schwenningen and Bad Dürrheim. The traditionally marked spring of the river lies in the city park Möglingshöhe in Schwenningen.

Prior to the Landesgartenschau Villingen-Schwenningen 2010, the Neckar flowed in the city center of Schwenningen mostly underground. In order to protect the city better from the more frequent flooding through overflow of the duct, the river received more space through a new, mostly open riverbed. This riverbed runs largely on the newly constructed horticultural show ground, which was used as the occasion for the remodeling.

Headwaters

Up to shortly before Rottweil the Neckar is only a small rivulet on the Baar plateau. In Deißlingen-Lauffen it has its only, high, waterfall which is drained today. Afterward, the Neckar joins with the Eschach coming from the eastern slopes of the Black Forest which is much more water bearing. Its main tributary Glasbach, which originates at the Brogen, is hydrographically seen as the main river of the Neckar river system.

With this junction above Rottweil the Neckar enters a narrow, wooded valley and for the next 80 km it bores its way towards north between the ranges of the Black Forest and the Swabian Jura. It has created two cut-off meander spurs at the Neckarburg which is spanned by the Neckarburgbrücke. Further down the river lies high above the river the old town of Oberndorf on a Calcareous sinter terrace, which fills one of the bowl-like side valleys. At Horb it turns from the Gäu Plateau towards north east and then follows the western side of the Swabian Jura (Albtrauf). Near Weitingen the valley is traversed by the 127 m high Neckar Viaduct of the A 81. At Rottenburg it enters the wider valley of Tübingen. After Tübingen the valley narrows again. From here onwards, the surrounding elevated grounds are considerably more densely populated.

At Plochingen the Neckar turns sharply north west at the &quot;Neckarknie&quot; (knee of the Neckar), the mouth of the Fils coming down from the east, from the Swabian Jura. Beginning from here the river has been expanded into a canalised waterway. It lies up to Stuttgart in a wide, urbanized meadow, which has been built over with industry and is cut through by transportation structures. Only around the Cannstatter valley bend for a short distance it is interspersed by large park areas. Here again the valley sides show limestone-sinter.
Between Stuttgart and Lauffen the Neckar cuts a scenic, meandering, and in many places steep-sided, valley into fossiliferous Triassic limestones and Pleistocene travertine. 
After Stuttgart it turns again towards the general northern direction. In a winding and narrow valley section through the Ludwigsburg (district) the Rems enters from the right at Remseck and then again from the right north of Marbach the Murr. After passing the Hessigheimer Felsengärten the water-rich Enz enters from the left at Besigheim. The former rapid at the Lauffener avulsion of the meander is today under water due to the canalization. In the Lowlands around Heilbronn the Neckar runs again through a wide meadow an open landscape. At Bad Friedrichshall it takes up within only two kilometers the other two of its large tributaries: First its water-richest tributary, the Kocher and then the officially longest, the Jagst, in total roughly doubling its discharge.

Lower reaches

Between Bad Wimpfen with its Stauferpfalz and Mosbach, the Neckar enters the Odenwald, where, again in a gorge-like valley, high, elevated, forested slopes line its riverside and especially on the right side, deeply cut valleys enter. At the last of his distinctive knees at Eberbach it turns west, enters at Hirschhorn for a short distance Hessian territory and is then up to Neckarsteinach on long parts the border between Baden-Württemberg and Hessen. At Neckargemünd the Elsenz enters from the left, its lower reaches using a part of the Neckars former Maurer river loop which extended far south. At the city of Heidelberg, which borders in the north the Odenwald and at the south the Königstuhl (Odenwald), the Neckarvalley is cut in the deepest by over 400m through mountains. After passing the Heidelberger historic city, the river enters the wide Upper Rhine Plain and after further about 25 kilometers in Mannheim roughly at its middle it enters the Rhine from the right.

=== Tributaries ===
The largest tributaries of the Neckar are the Enz with the largest drainage area, the Kocher with the highest average water drainage and the longest one, the Jagst. The Kocher tributary Lein is at its end not only longer than the Kocher, but also more water-abundant. Therefore, according to hydrographic convention, the Lein would have to be regarded as the main river of the Kocher water system, making it with then 201 kilometers the longest tributary of the Neckar.

== River history ==

The primal Neckar started off as an escarpment riverlet due to the slow rise of the Black Forest and the connected slow erosive retraction of the South German Scarplands.
For a long time it flowed on the high plains of the different Gäu Plateaus created through the hard chalks of the Muschelkalk. At Horb the river was redirected to the northeast due to the rift structure of the so-called &quot;Swabian Lineament&quot;, which lies roughly parallel to the escarpment of the Swabian Jura. Following that the Neckar cut into the Muschelkalk plateau between Rottweil and Rottenburg as well as the younger Keuper and Jura layers in the northeast, and created narrow water gaps in the area of the morphologically hard chalks and sandstones. 

The river deepening was also caused by the further rise of the Black Forest as well as the retracting erosion of the attacking younger Neckar route. This younger Neckar route tapped the primal Neckar system at Plochingen (hence the &quot;Neckarknie&quot;), which flowed through the primal lone to the primal Danube. Another influence on this river area was the Schurwald, a dissected cuesta of the filder rift, working as a river guideline.

Today&#x27;s lower reaches used to be those of the primal Enz. Until, through the erosive retraction of a tributary of the primal Enz near Besigheim, the Neckar river network was tapped. That is how the Enz became a tributary of the Neckar. Another trace of the former north western extent of the Danube river network is the Eschach running from north west to south east, hence towards the primal Danube. With the retraction of the escarpment, it was tapped by a Neckar tributary and redirected by about 90° to the east. Considering river history, it was never a headstream of the Neckar.

Until 2000 years ago the Neckar flowed through a pastureland in the Oberrheinische Tiefebene in a tangle of meanders, slings, old waters and cut of arms between the Rhine in the west and the foot of the Odenwald in the east until it finally entered the Rhine only north of Darmstadt at Trebur; roughly 50 km north of today&#x27;s confluence in Mannheim. On large stretches you can still see it on aerial photos.

In the 13th century, the confluence was south of Mannheim. A great flood changed the course of the Neckar in around 1275. Since then it enters the Rhine north of the city. The last change here took place in connection with the straightening of the Rhine by the Friesenheimer breakthrough west of today&#x27;s Friesenheimer Island. Previously the Neckar entered the Rhine in the area of today&#x27;s industrial port of Mannheim. Its new riverbed was also the reason for the relocation of the Neckar. After the old Neckar was cut off in early 1869, it followed the path of the new Neckar breakthrough, which was finished by 1880.

== River landscape ==
=== Natural landscape ===
Narrow and widening valleys alternate along the Neckar&#x27;s course. The narrows are mostly deepenings into the Muschelkalk plateau and the Buntsandstein below. Widenings developed in the area of morphologically soft clay and marl. Wide valley meadows also developed through the strong backfilling with Aue clay since the start of settlement in the Neolithic and the accompanying deforestation and soil erosion. In the area of the narrows the meander and cut-off meander spurs stand out. The meanders were formed through the primal Neckar, which sluggishly flowed through the almost even Muschelkalk plateau, forming the basic structures during the deepening phases and cutting into the hard Muschelkalk. The best known cut-off meander spur is the one at Lauffen; it cut through in historical times and created a waterfall (historic: &quot;Laufen&quot;). At the cutbanks one can find rocks, formed by the limestone of the upper Muschelkalk. For example, the rock gardens at Hessigheim. They lie on the marls and clays of the middle Muschelkalks and can sag in whole stone packages, so-called &quot;Schollen&quot;, down towards the Neckar. In the Odenwald narrow ravines and gorges lead into the Neckar from both sides, as for example, the Wolfschlucht and the Margarethenschlucht.

=== Cultural landscape ===

Due to the risk of flooding the valley plains remained unsettled for a long time, but the nutritious and, due to its good structure, very arable land was intensively used for agriculture, and to a large degree the valley plains are still used agriculturally today. The fertile soil allows the cultivation of lucrative specialty crops like vegetables or hops, for example, between Rottenburg and Tübingen.

Gravel pit quarrying in the valley plains takes away agricultural land, but created large lakes, nowadays used for recreational purposes. These borrow pits also became habitat for birds, amphibians and aquatic creatures. Such large borrow pits can be found for example near Kirchentellinsfurt and between Freiberg am Neckar and Pleidelsheim. The gravel bodies of the Neckar have an additional role as water reservoir and are in many places used for drinking water production. The paths usually went over the heights and only crossed the valleys where there were fords over the Neckar.

This changed with the onset of industrialisation in the 19th century. It brought fundamental conflicts regarding the land usage of the flat valley plain. Large even spaces became sought after for industrial sites. The Neckar was mostly straightened in order to prevent flooding and to gain areas for industrial buildings. The river itself was expanded over the course of centuries. With the development into a heavy shipping lane in the early 20th century, the last freely flowing parts between Plochingen and the mouth disappeared and the whole river in this part nowadays is characterized by dam areas. In the strongly textured Neckar area the valley became the only possibility for modern transportation infrastructure. Construction of railway lines and avenues in the valley plains changed the Neckar valley from a cultural to an industrial landscape.

One example is the densely populated and industrialised Neckar valley between Plochingen and Bad Cannstatt, which harbors large companies such as Daimler AG (the maker of Mercedes Benz cars) and Mahle GmbH and recreational facilities with large area consumption like the MHPArena, the Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-Halle or the Cannstatter Wasen, the second-largest fair of Germany. The term &quot;Wasen&quot; gives a clue, that there used to be a floodplain on which the fair was held. Distinctive points in the industrial landscape of the Neckar valley are the high chimneys of the coal-fired power station Altbach/Deizisau and Heilbronn as well as the assembly halls of the Daimler-engine plant in Untertürkheim and the Audi plant in Neckarsulm.

Along the Neckar&#x27;s valley in the Odenwald hills many castles can be found, including Hornberg Castle and Guttenberg Castle in Haßmersheim; the now-mothballed Obrigheim Nuclear Power Plant and the active Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant are also located there.

In contrast to the plains, the mostly steep slopes are often forested and in forestry use. The sun-exposed south-facing sites are frequently used for vineyards and are terraced with dry walls. There the local red wine grapes Trollinger, Schwarzriesling and Lemberger are cultivated, which are also traditionally mostly drunk in Württemberg. Especially the middle Neckar around Besigheim and Lauffen is characterized by in parts extremely steep vineyards, which can be cultivated only by hand.

The vine terrasses at the Neckar together with the drainage area of the tributaries deliver the largest part of the cultivation area of the Württemberg wine region. The vineyards at the lower reaches from Heinsheim to Heidelberg are part of the Baden wine region. Until the end of the 19th century, vineyard cultivation was more extensive in the Neckar valley including unfavorable sites. Today these have been abandoned and gone fallow, reclaimed by wildlife. One example is the southern slopes of the Spitzberg above the Neckar near Tübingen.

The river&#x27;s course provides a popular route for cyclists, especially during the summer months. The slopes of the Neckar are preferred areas for high-level residential areas because they allow wide, unobstructed views.

=== Renaturation ===
The diverse usage of raw water and waterway, as well for the production of hydropower brought with it substantial interventions into the ecological structure of the river. Multiple initiatives are advocated for the land restoration the Neckar, the ecological enhancement of the river network, the improvement of the water quality, improved flood control and the creation of attractive local recreational areas alongside the river. Only recently within the frame of the nationwide campaign lively rivers and the initiative &quot;Lebendiger Neckar&quot; (German: lively Neckar), it was begun to free it from its partly-existing concrete corset. The river has in parts been redeveloped as a local recreational area and habitat for animals and plants. It still remains a symbol of endangered nature with the highest power plant density in Germany. At an oxygen content of below 4 mg/L power plant owners have to run specially designed turbines to inject air into the water. As of 2003, no mass die-off of fish due to lack of oxygen had occurred for 20 years.

== Climate ==
The Neckar valley functions as a cold air basin, which means that under cloudless skies the heavier, cold, night air which develops on the sparsely vegetated plateaus and hills, flows into the basin and concentrates there. Especially during the cold season, such &quot;cold lakes&quot; can contribute to the creation of fog while all around on the plateaus the sun shines. The orography of the Neckar valley facilitates such inversive weather conditions.

The Neckar valley is known for its wine cultivation climate and the cultivation of Trollinger, Lemberger, Kerner, Müller-Thurgau amongst other locally grown grape varieties. Wine cultivation has receded over the 20th century and cultivation of the &quot;Württemberger Wein&quot; is mostly restricted to the south-facing slopes with high radiation gain in the Neckar valley and its side valleys, as wine cultivation is labor-intensive and in Württemberg competitive only in the best sites.

== Navigation ==
Various excavations of harbor installations and findings lead to the conclusion that the Neckar navigation already existed during the Roman Age in the first century. Especially on the lower Neckar. Main purpose was probably the transportation of construction material for the Limes and provisions. Later the Neckar navigation was probably restarted by the Franks.

=== Historical Development ===
==== Timber floating from 1100 ====
Starting from 1100 the usage of the Neckar as a waterway with line boats and rafts has been attested. The river was already blocked by weirs in the surroundings of several cities during the High Middle Ages. In Heilbronn a harbour was mentioned for the first time in 1146. The Neckar privilege granted by Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV in 1333 allowed the free imperial city the construction of a weir. After its construction, the continuous traffic on the river was for several centuries blocked. An annoyance for the neighbours. The permission of passage for raftsman therefore had to be determined contractually. In 1342 Württemberg, the Markgrafschaft Baden and the free imperial city signed an agreement for the opening of the Neckar for rafts between Besigheim and Heilbronn. A treaty from 1476 between the free imperial city Esslingen, Württemberg and Austria fixed free rafting trade as well. The last raft went through Tübingen down the Neckar river on October 26, 1899.

The wood from the eastern Northern Black Forest was shipped through the Neckar and then Rhine up to Holland. Because of the developing seafaring the shipbuilding had a large demand for wood. The firewood from the Schurwald was combined to up to 260 Meter long rafts in Plochingen.

==== Navigation from the 16th century onward ====
The Neckar gained importance as a waterway in the middle of the 16th century due to the beginning upper German trade. Despite many interventions in the river course in order to improve navigation, the river which had a towpath, was because of dangerous rapids and shallows only navigable for smaller barges and this mostly only up to Heilbronn.

Making the upper Neckar navigable was then pushed ahead by Christoph, Duke of Württemberg who got the necessary permission from Emperor Karl V. in 1553. The city of Heilbronn still insisted on its rights so that the river was blocked at Heilbronn which meant that the upper Neckar and therefore Württemberg remained cut off from the navigation coming from the Rhine. All shipped goods were subject to Heilbronner staple right. In the late 16th century, Duke of Württemberg, Frederick I had plans for the navigation passage but discarded those in 1598 and instead planned to construct a württembergian trade port in Kochendorf. – which was as unsuccessful as his successors plans to build one in Untereisesheim. During the times of need in the 17th century, the navigation was insignificant.

Immediately above Mannheim interventions were necessary due to regular floods. After 1622, smaller corrections were made at the back then-existing Neckar loops between Mannheims Feudenheim and today&#x27;s Friedrich-Ebert-Bridge. Floods still occurred and threatened the city, lastly in 1784 and 1789. The situation was then relaxed through the straightening of the river bed by means of for breakthroughs in combination with the lowering of the river bed as well as fortifications and dams.

After consolidation of the situation in the 18th century, electoral palatinate market ships regularly travelled on the lower Neckar river. On the upper Neckar boats regularly travelled between Heilbronn and Cannstatt for several years around 1720; the expansion of the navigation to the Württembergian Plochingen further up the river failed due to the free imperial city of Esslingen. While the electoral palatinate shipping on the lower Neckar was quite successful, the shipping on the upper Neckar was soon stopped again as the river was not suitably enough expanded for a navigation and moreover no funding was available for the further upgrading. Württemberg and the Electoral Palatinate signed a trade agreement in order to start up the Neckar navigation between Mannheim and Cannstatt during a time of economical rise in the late 18th century. In 1782 the previous two and the free imperial city of Heilbronn agreed upon facilitations in the Neckar trade but which were only of administrative nature. The Neckar still remained blocked at the weir in Heilbronn.

The Napoleonic times around 1800 brought a downfall to the Neckar navigation. On the one hand – because most parts of the lower Neckar area had fallen to Baden and the free imperial cities of Heilbronn and Esslingen to Württemberg – the many disputes and obstructions of the former small states did not hamper the trade anymore. But during the Continental System the navigation was restricted and ships and material were confiscated. The introduction of the Mannheimer Stapels (&quot;Mannheim stable&quot;) in 1808 meant that the merchants of Mannheim gained control over almost all Neckar trade. During the German Campaign of 1813 only small ships travelled on the Neckar, mainly military transports. The Congress of Vienna demanded the freedom of traffic on the Neckar and Rhine rivers in 1814/1815.

==== Continuous navigability with the Wilhelmskanal in 1821 ====

The 550-meter-long Wilhelmskanal (&quot;Wilhelms canal&quot;) was constructed in Heilbronn from 1819 to 1821. The reason was the bypassing of the entire weir area and many mills. After further river construction measures, the Neckar became navigable all the way between the Rhine and Cannstatt. A lock gate at the upper end of the canal could turn it during floods into a port of refuge which was, already in 1829, expanded into a port of transshipment. In 1827 the Mannheimer Stapel was lifted through which the Neckar navigators gained back free access to the Rhine river. The Rheinschiffahrtsakte (&quot;Mannheim Act&quot;) from 1831 and in consequence of it the (&quot;Neckar navigation regulations&quot;) from 1832 brought, through simplified regulations and tariffs a significant rise for the navigation. But because of its shallows and rapids the river was considered one of the most dangerous in Germany. In 1836 the (&quot;Neckar shipping guild&quot;) was dissolved, which had since 1810 tried to gain a monopoly on the Neckar trade. With the ratification of the in 1842 all Guilds were dissolved and thereby economic freedom created.

From 1841/42 onwards the Heilbronn-based Neckar-Dampfschifffahrt introduced a regular passenger and general cargo transport from Heilbronn to Mannheim. Despite the usage of modern steam ships, horses still pulled the heavy barges on the towpath upriver. The reason was that the steam ships were not yet strong enough herefore.

The competition of rail transport made steam ships as well as towing barges gradually uneconomic in the second half of the 19th century. Rafting on the other hand kept its importance, but adapted to the age of the railroad. Because trunks from the Black forest did more and more go by train to Heilbronn and only from there continued their trip on the water, a new rafting harbour was constructed in Heilbronn in 1875. Above Esslingen the rafting was only of little importance. The last raft passed the city on 28. Oktober 1899.

A new recovery for the Neckar navigation came with the chain boat navigation begun in 1878. Despite the construction of a railroad line along the Neckar. Between Mannheim and Heilbronn steam towboats with attached barges were now able to pull themselves upriver on a 115 km long chain which had been put into the river. Through that, the trip between Mannheim and Heilbronn was shortened to two to three days. On the horse drawn ships it had previously taken five to eight days. But often the water depth was not deep enough. The vernacular name for the chain boats was Neckaresel (&quot;Neckar donkey&quot;). The last chain boat navigation was still done 1933 – 1935 between Neckargerach and the barrage Kochendorf.

The world&#x27;s first motorboat made during the summer of 1886 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach was named &quot;Neckar&quot; when their &quot;Standuhr&quot; (grandfather clock) petrol engine was tested on the river near Bad Cannstatt.

The motorized cargo navigation began on the Neckar in 1925. The first motor cargo ship on the river was ordered by the brothers Ludwig (1887–1955) and Jakob Götz (1890–1977) already in 1924 at the Anderssen Werft (&quot;Anderssen shipyard&quot;). It was put into service in 1925 and christened &quot;Gebrüder Götz&quot;. The motor cargo ship was operated by the shipping company drove for the shipping company Ludwig und Jakob Götz, founded in 1920. One of the best known shipping companies on the Neckar, which was also involved in the upgrading of the river to a heavy shipping waterway.

In 1946 the first transportation order for coal after the Second World War on the Neckar was awarded and shipped by Johann Friedrich Boßler with his motor cargo ship Elisabeth.

==== Upgrading to a heavy shipping waterway between 1921 and 1968 ====

In order to provide the rising industrial area around Stuttgart a waterway connection for fully rigged ships, first plannings for channelling of the Neckar between Mannheim and Plochingen began already in 1904. The goal was to be mostly independent from natural impacts as for example low waters or floating ice. With the Württembergian side Otto Konz (1875–1965) was assigned who remained connected to the Neckar upgrading the rest of his life. A memorandum from 1910 allowed for ships up to 1000 tons, according to plans from 1919 the transportation was planned for the 1200-t-ship.

Because the Neckar was earmarked as a Reichswasserstraße (literally:&quot;realm waterway&quot;) in the Weimar Constitution in 1919 (officially from 1. April 1921), Neckarbaudirektion (literally: &quot;Neckar construction department&quot;) was introduced in 1920 whose head Otto Konz became. The department was directly subordinated to the German Reich (often called &quot;Weimar Republic&quot;). In 1921 the German Reich, the Neckar adjoining states Württemberg, Baden and Hessen agreed in a state treaty the upgrading of the Neckar to a heavy shipping waterway. In order to finance the construction project they founded the Neckar AG with a construction loan from the German Reich, the three States and several municipalities in the same year. As compensation the AG received the right to use the simultaneously expanded hydropower until 2034 and to redeem the construction loan with the profits; this right transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany. As chairman of the Neckar AG were elected Otto Hirsch from the Württembergian ministry of internal affairs and Otto Konz. In consideration of the world famous cityscape of Heidelberg and in order to bring the further barrages in unison with nature and landscape, the architect Paul Bonatz worked for the project (1877–1956).

Construction began immediately along the entire distance in 1921. Along a stretch of 113 km length the first eleven barrages between Mannheim and the new canal harbour in Heilbronn were finished in 1935. This canal harbour became later through the further expansion the barrage channel Heilbronn.
The expansion of the Neckar to a heavy shipping waterway lead to a shipbuilding industry exclusively for the passenger traffic on the river. Already in 1926 the brothers Georg (1881–1946) and Andreas Boßler (1884–1961) founded the Personenschiffahrt Gebr. Bossler, which makes the Gebrüder Bossler pioneers for passenger navigation on the Neckar.

While the river was upgraded and the barrages constructed, the Neckar-Enz-Stellung, a defensive fortification against enemies approaching from the West was constructed between 1935 and 1938. It was based between Eberbach and Besigheim on the natural obstacle of the Neckar river and from thereon followed the Enz upriver up to Enzweihingen.

Upgrading works were begun near Plochingen at the upper end of the intended waterway and plans existed to make the Fils between Plochingen and Göppingen navigable. The area for a harbour in Göppingen remained reserved in spatial planning until 1978. The construction chairman Konz also ordered the planning of a tunnel through the Swabian Jura for a waterway Ulm at the Danube in order to create a waterway between upper Rhine and upper Danube, as the State treaty from 1921 had planned. But those plans were dropped from 1968 onwards.

After 1935 the upgrading slowed down. Until 1943 only six barrages above Heilbronn were constructed, but without locks. Hirsch was forced out of office and murdered in the KZ Mauthausen in 1941. Konz went into provisional retirement because of national socialist repressions. The constructions were mostly stopped during the second world war. Only in 1948 the barrage construction above Heilbronn was continued, until 1952 again led by Otto Konz. The section up to Stuttgart was finished in 1958 and Stuttgart harbour was opened by the president Theodor Heuß together with Otto Konz. With the opening of the Plochingen harbour in 1968 the expansion goal for the Neckar was reached after 47 years of construction. The river was dammed up at 27 locks and thereby had become a heavy shipping waterway from Mannheim to Plochingen.

Every barrage consists of a weir with two to six openings and different gates, a double lock and a remote-controlled hydropower plant next to each other. At seven barrages, where a larger damming up was not possible due to the landscape, a parallel barrage and hydropower canal varying in length from 1.5 to 7.5 km has been constructed. At two further barrages a breakthrough exists which cuts of a river bend. In total only 17% of the entire distance from the Rhine up to the mouth of the Rems lie in an artificial waterbed, which means the river character dominates. On the last 32 km of the waterway in the area of the less water carrying upper river which is at the same time heavily used economically, almost the entire river bed had to be constructed artificially.

Neckar at Stuttgart-Untertürkheim through heavily industrialized area
The Neckar (Ne) is being administered after taking over step-by-step from the Neckar AG since 1970 from Mannheim to Plochingen as a Bundeswasserstraße (literally &quot;federal waterway&quot;) by the water- and navigation offices Stuttgart and Heidelberg. The Federal Republic is owner of the waterway. Sport boats including paddle and rowing boats are subject to the Binnenschifffahrtsstraßen-Ordnung, valid on the Neckar which for example defines the need of identification and the rules for the right of way. 159 water abstraction points and 628 water intakes show the heavy water economical usage.

On the Neckar, which is nowadays classified as a &quot;Wasserstraße des Typs Va&quot; (waterway Type Va) from km 201.5 at Plochingen to its mouth (km 0), 7332 river boats transported in 2012 7.5 million tons. The largest parts of these tons were made up of construction material (1,9 Millionen t) and coal (1,6 Millionen t) as well as salt (1,3 Millionen t). 21.000 TEU Containers were transported. Leisure ships run by various companies travel on the river for tourists. On the upper Neckar the passenger navigation is handled by the company Neckar-Käpt&#x27;n.

On December 8, 1954, the &quot;Neckarhafen Plochingen GmbH&quot; was founded. From 1960 until 1963 the last barrage was constructed near Deizisau. The construction of the &quot;Neckarhafen Plochingen&quot; started on April 29, 1964. The first ship landed in Plochingen on July 12, 1968, after it had been blessed with the name &quot;Plochingen&quot; by Gertrud Hartung, the mayor&#x27;s wife. In the harbour 15 companies generated an annual revenue of about 500 to 600 Million Euro in 2004.

==== Stuttgart harbour ====
The Neckarhafen Stuttgart was constructed in two steps, from 1954 until 1958 and from 1966 until 1968. The harbour area covers a total area of 100 ha. The three basins including the federal waterway have a water surface of 30,7 ha.

==== Cannstatt harbour ====
The first Cannstatter &quot;Hafen am Mühlgrün&quot; was inaugurated by duke Eberhard Louis in 1713. It remained insignificant.

==== Heilbronn harbour ====
The Heilbronn harbour with a total factory area of 78 ha and a quay length of 7,2 km based on the turnover the 7th largest inland harbour in Germany (2010) and the largest of the Neckar. Over 50% of the Neckar turnover is done here. In total about 4 million tons per year. About 60% of the turnover are domestic trade, the rest are international goods and commodities. Additionally to commodities and construction material (coal, Salt) grain, iron, steel and timber are loaded.

==== Mannheim harbour ====
The Mannheim harbour is one of the most important inland harbours in Europe and the second-largest in Germany. The harbour has a total water surface of 267,9 ha, additionally there is 863,5 ha land area. About 500 companies with 20.000 employees have settled in the harbour area. In 1968 the first Container-Terminal in an inland harbour was opened here. Furthermore, a RoRo-facility and since 1991 a combined transport terminal. On the water side 7.64 million tons of goods were turned over in 2010. The largest stakes have bituminous coal 2.2 million t, food- and fodder with 0.92 million t and chemical goods with 1.59 million t. At the container terminal on the water side 120.568 units were turned over.

The harbour basin spreads out around the mouth of the Neckar along the Rhine and Neckar. The overall complex includes the Ludwigshafener Rheinhafen, which is situated directly on the opposite side of the Rhine river.

=== Barrages ===

The maximum size of the river boats driving on the Neckar is limited by the locks of the 27 barrages. Those are in general 110 m long and 12 m wide; the allowed dimensions are therefore 105 m x 11.45 m. Since 1952 almost every Barrage got a second lock. 23 of those locks use almost 50% of the water of one chamber to fill the other empty chamber in order to save water (so-called twin locks). In order to prevent jams at the mouth of the Neckar, the first barrage Feudenheim received a further lock in 1973 (190 m × 12 m). The barrages have an average distance of 7 km between each other (between 0.9 and 13.7 km, see table) and are used to cover the difference in altitude of 160.70 m to the Rhine at low water. The waterway depth is since 2000 continuously 3.80 m. This means that the Stuttgart harbour can be reached by the large motor ships of the Rhine, which have a draft of 2.6 m and a loading capacity of 2200 t. In the coming years it is planned to refurbish the locks and partly extend them. In total the federal government invests 575 Million Euro for this project. For its execution, the Amt für Neckarausbau Heidelberg was founded in 2007. In order to make the Neckar navigable for 135 m long ships, one of each dual lock chamber is going to be lengthened. Furthermore, the old chambers are going to be refurbished and certain sections and turn around spots expanded. The barrages between Mannheim and Heilbronn are supposed to be lengthened until 2026. The Gundelsheim lock received the title &quot;most water sport friendly lock&quot; in 2012.

In contrast to other waterways as for example the Mosel or Main there are no boat locks except for Bad Cannstatt. Therefore, yachts and sailing boats are normally locked in the river boat locks. The rails installed at the other 26 barrages to pull boats from one side to the other are often in a bad condition or even unusable. In some places canoes can, if allowed by the locks staff, use the lock as well. This is especially used on group trips.

Since 2004 the remote control center in Stuttgart-Obertürkheim (Fernbedienzentrale, FBZ) controls all locks from Deizisau to Stuttgart-Hofen on the upper Neckar.

=== Stream gauge and flood ===
Crucial for the professional and recreational navigation on the Neckar are its stream gauges. According to the Hochwassermeldeordnung (HMO, flood report regulation) of the State Baden-Württemberg the following Hochwassermeldehöhen are valid at the stream gauge:

Gauge Plochingen

The gauge in Plochingen (since 1905) was the only gauge at the waterway that lay in free descent. In 1962 the moveable barrage in Deizisau was constructed. In order to keep water level differences caused by the barrage, a ridge was constructed about 100 m below the Plochingen street bridge and moved the gauge there. The large flood in February 1970 destroyed the ridge made of stones. Because the costs for a new ridge made out of concrete seemed to be too high, a more economic solution was found. Out of the stream gauges and discharge of the gauges in Wendlingen (Neckar-km 206,5 – for the upper Neckar) and Reichenbach (Fils-km 2,5 – for the Fils) water gauges and discharges are algorithmically calculated and published.

Flood

* 1824: The most serious flood in the Neckar area happened in October 1824. Estimates conclude for a HQ4000, that means a return period of 4000 years.
A study has been done to clustering simultaneous occurrences of the Extreme Floods in the Neckar Catchment and the results shows the Neckar catchment has been divided into three major clusters. The first cluster mainly covers the western part and is bounded by the Black Forest and Swabian Alps. The second cluster is mostly located in the eastern part of the upper Neckar. The third cluster contains the remaining lowland areas of the Neckar basin 

=== Freeze up ===
* 1709: From January 18 until January 28 and from January 31 until February 13 as well as shortly after February 13 until March 23 the Neckar was frozen up.

== Structures ==

=== Mills ===

The hydropower of the Neckar drove numerous mills, of which some are surviving to today:
* In Rottweil a powder mill existed since the 15th century which merged to the Powder factory Rottweil in 1863.
* In Gundelsheim the building of the &quot;Alten Neckarmühle&quot; (old Neckar mill) dates back to 1604. The milling was stopped following the Neckar regulation. The last miller was Meister Batz around 1935/36. There is no equipment in place anymore, for a time it was used gastronomically. Worth seeing are a large stone with a coat of arms and old inscriptions.

=== Power stations ===
At least since the early 20th century, power stations replaced the historical mills. Since then the Neckar has been used for commercial electricity production through hydroelectric power. Several transregionally known hydro plants can be found at the Neckar: 

* In Horb the construction of a hydroelectric plant was begun at the island front at the level of the Schillerstraße in February 2010. It started producing electricity on April 13, 2011. The hydroelectric plant is expected to produce 2.3 kWh yearly in the future – enough in order to supply about 600 four-person households with electricity. Together with the already existing, refurbished facilities it has an average total power of 437 kW. The total investments were about 5.5 million Euro.
* In Rottenburgs district Bad Niedernau the Wasserkraftwerk Bad Niedernau can be found.
* In Rottenburg am Neckar the two power plants Beim Preußischen and Tübinger Straße.

* In Kiebingen the Rottenburger clock factory Junghans did run since 1903 their own power plant, which still produces electricity today. For the clock factory the plant run by water and steam was over-dimensioned, therefore the overproduction was sold. Today the historic powerhouse is under monumental protection. Despite its age, the power plant is a very modern plant with three characteristics: The turbines have an innovative scoop shape which has been developed with computer simulations, special Thordon-Turbine bearings and inflatable rubber dam. A fish pass recreates since the modernization the pervasiveness for the fish migration at the weir.
* The hydroelectric plant Tübingen-Hirschau is located between Hirschau and Tübingen as well as the &quot;Wasserkraftwerk Rappenberghalde&quot; which was constructed in 1930. It was refurbished in 1999 and today the two Kaplan turbines produce together with the residual water turbine at the weir upstream in Hirschau 7 million kWh electricity per year. Per second more than 22 cubic metres of water flow through a 1.7 km long supply canal to the plant. The plant uses the incline of the Neckar of 7.5 meters.
* The Wasserkraftwerk Neckarwerk in Tübingen was constructed together with the weir within the frame of the Neckar regulation as one of the first roller dams in Germany in 1910/1911. It is used for electricity generation as well as control of the river. Through the weir the water level of the Neckar in Tübingen center is managed. Before the construction of the weir the Neckar was full of gravel banks and hat a very flat waterfront. This can be seen on many photographs and drawings prior to the construction. Moreover, floods, which now and then flooded the back then only few buildings in Wöhrd and sometimes threatened the Neckar bridge have been eliminated with this weir and the other weirs (e.g. in Rottenburg). For fish a fish ladder has been constructed later on. The pedestrian bridge over the weir is an important connection of the two waterfronts between Lustnau and the central Eberhards or Neckar bridge. It also provides a nice view of Neckar, historic city center, abbey church and castle.
* The Kraftwerk Oberesslingen is a run-of-the-river hydroelectricity plant between two Neckar islands at river kilometer 195.6 in Oberesslingen. The plant was constructed in 1929 in the frame of the upgrading to a heavy waterway according to a design made by the architect Paul Bonatz. It has a capacity of 2.1 MW and delivers per year about 12.3 GWh energy. The average flow ist 45 cubic meter per second.
* In Esslingen a new run-of-the-river hydroelectricity plant has been constructed on the Hechtkopf. With a power of 1.25 MW and a yearly electricity production of 7.1 GWh 4000 people can be supplied with electricity. With the construction of this new power plant the last of the barrages on the Neckar has been equipped with turbines. It is framed by a weir in the Neckar on one side and the historical bridge house over the Hammerkanal (hammer canal) on the other side.
* The Drehstromübertragung Lauffen–Frankfurt was on August 25, 1891, the worldwide first transmission of electric energy with high voltage alternating three-phase current. On the occasion of the International Electrotechnical Exhibition 1891 the electricity generated by the hydropower plant at the Mühlgraben in Lauffen am Neckar was upvolted to 15 kV and transported over 175 km to Frankfurt am Main where it did run an artificial waterfall. The power plant was moved up river during the upgrading of the Neckar. The original generator is now located in the Deutschen Museum (German Museum) in Munich.
* The hydropower plant Heilbronn lies on the old Neckar in the city center and not on the canal. Therefore, no lock exists here.
* At the Heidelberger Karlstor is another barrage with lock; the corresponding power plant is the only underwater hydropower plant at the Neckar. The construction permission the Neckar AG 1994 received for it in 1994 had a number of requirements. Neither were visible changes at the weir which is under monumental protection, nor should the new power plant change the historic cityscape of Heidelberg. The technical solution was a power plant embbeded invisibly under the riverbed.
* At the weir in Heidelberg the weir bridge connects the city districts Wieblingen and Neuenheim.

Additionally, the Neckar is and has been a cooling water supply for coal and nuclear power plants. Near Esslingen-Zell the Neckar cools the Altbach Power Station, one of the most modern bituminous coal power plants in Europe. It consists of two blocks and is located on the area of the two municipalities Altbach and Deizisau. It can including its gas turbines and the combination block 4 produce a maximum of about 1270 MW of electrical power.

The Heizkraftwerk Stuttgart-Gaisburg, the incineration facility of the Kraftwerks Stuttgart-Münster, the Kraftwerk Marbach, the Kraftwerk Walheim, the Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Station, the Kraftwerk Heilbronn and the mothballed Obrigheim Nuclear Power Plant source their cooling or evaporation water from the Neckar as well.

=== Bridges ===
Famous bridges include the Neckar Valley Bridge Weitingen, near the town Horb am Neckar and the Old Bridge, in Heidelberg.

The ladder is amongst the best known historic bridges. It already existed in the High Middle Ages and was erected in today&#x27;s form in 1788. Further historic Neckar bridges are the Neckarbrücke in Lauffen am Neckar, in the core dating back to 1532, the Neckar bridge in Sulz constructed in 1742, the Pliensaubrücke, the Alte Agnesbrücke (old Agnes bridge) and the Ulrichsbrücke in Köngen. The oldest still remaining Neckar bridge is the Innere Brücke in Esslingen. The 230 meter long construction was built in the 13th century and consists of eleven stone arches.

The Neckartalbrücke Heilbronn is with 1348 meter the longest Neckarbridge. The prestressed concrete construction built in 1967 is ailing and since early 2018 being replaced by a new bridge.

In Neckargröningen the 85-meter longest free spanning wooden pedestrian bridge was created in 1990. The unusual structure has a triangle profile. Die älteste Spannbeton-Eisenbahnbrücke Deutschlands – erbaut 1957 – steht in Heilbronn.

In the year 1905, there were already 119 bridges over the Neckar, of which, with a total length of 230 meters, the longest was the Neckargartacher Neckarbrücke built between 1903 and 1905. In 1985 the heavy waterway was crossed by 159 railroad-, street- and pedestrian-bridges and also by 126 overhead power lines and 67 Düker. In total there are today about 400 Neckar bridges of various sizes, half of it on the upper and half of it on the middle and lower reaches. &lt;!—counted on the OpenStreetMap-Map --&gt;

=== Castles and palaces ===
From Mannheim over Heidelberg, Eberbach, Mosbach up to Heilbronn the Castle Road runs almost parallel to the Neckar and passes on this about 100 km long section of the lower Neckar numerous castles and palaces. Most notably the Heidelberg Castle. Among the Neckar castles are also the four castles in Neckarsteinach, Dilsberg Castle, Burg Eberbach, Burg Hirschhorn, Zwingenberg Castle, Burg Stolzeneck, the Minneburg, Burg Dauchstein, Schloss Neuburg (Baden), the Hornberg Castle (the castle of Götz von Berlichingen) and the Guttenberg Castle (Deutsche Greifenwarte), Horneck Castle, and Burg Ehrenberg.

In the further course upriver to Stuttgart and continuing on, on the upper Neckar stand the Burg Horkheim and the Neippergsche Schloss Klingenberg, Schloss Lichtenegg, the Esslinger Burg, Burg Remseck, Schloss Liebenstein, the Weiler Burg, the Ruine Herrenzimmern, the Schloss Hohentübingen, the Schloss Weitenburg, the Ruine Albeck near Sulz am Neckar as well as the ruins Wehrstein and Neckarburg.

== The Neckar in literature ==
* Der Neckar poem by Friedrich Hölderlin 
*Friedrich Hölderlin wrote a poem entitled &quot;Der Neckar&quot;.
*The Neckar is mentioned prominently in Gustav Mahler&#x27;s 1893 &quot;Rheinlegendchen&quot; (&#x27;Little Rhine Legend&#x27;), first published in 1899 in a cycle of 12 songs under the title &quot;Humoresken&quot; (&#x27;Humoresques&#x27;), today known as one of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Songs from Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot; (Songs from &quot;The Youth&#x27;s Magic Horn&quot;).

<text>Fairview Cemetery is a cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is perhaps best known as the final resting place for over one hundred victims of the sinking of the Titanic. Officially known as Fairview Lawn Cemetery, the non-denominational cemetery is run by the Parks Department of the Halifax Regional Municipality.

== Location ==
Fairview Lawn Cemetery is located in the North End of Halifax at the Northern End of Windsor Street. It is bordered by the Saint John Anglican cemetery on one side and the Baron de Hirsch Cemetery on another.

== History ==
A blockhouse was built at the site in the 1750s to protect Halifax from attacks by the Mi&#x27;kmaq people. The land was subsequently developed as small farms. In 1893, the land was acquired by a private company, the Fairview Lawn Cemetery Limited, for a non-denominational cemetery because the Camp Hill Cemetery in the centre of the city was running out of room. The city of Halifax took over the cemetery in 1944. Fairview contains a cross section of Halifax&#x27;s 20th century residents including a Greek section and a Chinese section as well as a mass grave of victims from the Halifax Explosion and many other graves.

== &quot;Titanic&quot; victims ==

Fairview was selected by city coroner/registrar John Henry Barnstead as the site where the Titanic victims should be buried.

One hundred and twenty-one victims of the sinking are interred at Fairview, more than any other cemetery in the world. Most of them are memorialized with small gray granite markers with the name and date of death. Some families paid for larger markers with more inscriptions. The occupants of a third of the graves, however, have never been identified and their markers contain just the date of death and marker number. Surveyor E. W. Christie laid out three long lines of graves in gentle curves following the contours of the sloping site. By co-incidence, the curved shape suggests the outline of the bow of a ship. A complete listing of those victims buried in Fairview can be found here.

One of the better-known &quot;Titanic&quot; markers is for an unidentified child victim, known for decades as The Unknown Child. No one claimed the body, so he was buried with funds provided by sailors of , the cable ship that recovered his body. The marker bears the inscription &#x27;Erected to the memory of an unknown child whose remains were recovered after the disaster of the &quot;Titanic&quot; April 15, 1912&#x27;. In November 2002, the child was initially identified as 13-month-old Eino Viljami Panula of Finland. Eino, his mother, and four brothers all died in the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster. After additional forensic testing, the unknown child was re-identified as 19-month-old Sidney Leslie Goodwin, an English child who perished with his entire family.

A grave marked &quot;J. Dawson&quot; gained fame following the release of the 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot;, since the name of Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s character in the film is Jack Dawson. Many filmgoers, moved by the story, left flowers and ticket stubs at Dawson&#x27;s grave when the film was first released, and flowers continue to be left today. Film director James Cameron has said the character&#x27;s name was not in fact inspired by the grave. More recent research has revealed that the grave actually belongs to Joseph Dawson, an Irishman who worked in &quot;Titanic&quot;″s boiler room as a coal trimmer.

The Fairview &quot;Titanic&quot; graves also include the burial place and marker of William Denton Cox, a heroic steward who died while escorting third class passengers to the lifeboats. Six of the previously unknown &quot;Titanic&quot; victims were identified in 1991 with the help of the Titanic International Society. Newly-inscribed headstones bearing their names were unveiled on September 23, 1991, at ceremonies attended by then-Halifax Mayor Ronald Wallace, &quot;Titanic&quot; survivor Louise Pope, and more than 50 members of the Society. 

Twenty-nine other &quot;Titanic&quot; victims are buried elsewhere in Halifax; nineteen in the Roman Catholic Mount Olivet Cemetery and ten in the Jewish Baron de Hirsch Cemetery.

==War Graves==
The cemetery also contains 29 war graves of Commonwealth service personnel, 20 from World War I and 9 from World War II.

<doc id="95429" wikidata="Q43746" url="?curid=95429" title="Bonaventure">
<text>Bonaventure ( ; ; ; born Giovanni di Fidanza; 1221 – 15 July 1274) was an Italian Catholic Franciscan bishop, cardinal, scholastic theologian and philosopher.

The seventh Minister General of the Order of Friars Minor, he also served for a time as Bishop of Albano. He was canonised on 14 April 1482 by Pope Sixtus IV and declared a Doctor of the Church in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V, becoming known as the &quot;Seraphic Doctor&quot; (). His feast day is 15 July.

Many writings from the Middle Ages once attributed to him have been subsequently re-classified under the name &quot;Pseudo-Bonaventure&quot;.

==Life==
He was born at Civita di Bagnoregio, not far from Viterbo, then part of the Papal States. Almost nothing is known of his childhood, other than the names of his parents, Giovanni di Fidanza and Maria di Ritella. Bonaventure reports that in his youth he was saved from an untimely death by the prayers of Francis of Assisi, which is the primary motivation for Bonaventure&#x27;s writing the &quot;vita&quot;.

He entered the Franciscan Order in 1243 and studied at the University of Paris, possibly under Alexander of Hales, and certainly under Alexander&#x27;s successor, John of Rochelle. In 1253 he held the Franciscan chair at Paris. A dispute between seculars and mendicants delayed his reception as Master until 1257, where his degree was taken in company with Thomas Aquinas. Three years earlier his fame had earned him the position of lecturer on &quot;The Four Books of Sentences&quot;—a book of theology written by Peter Lombard in the twelfth century—and in 1255 he received the degree of master, the medieval equivalent of doctor.

After having successfully defended his order against the reproaches of the anti-mendicant party, he was elected Minister General of the Franciscan Order. On 24 November 1265, he was selected for the post of Archbishop of York; however, he was never consecrated and resigned the appointment in October 1266.

During his tenure, the General Chapter of Narbonne, held in 1260, promulgated a decree prohibiting the publication of any work out of the order without permission from superiors. This prohibition has induced modern writers to pass severe judgment upon Roger Bacon&#x27;s superiors, who were assumed to be envious of Bacon&#x27;s abilities. However, the prohibition enjoined on Bacon was a general one, which extended to the whole order. Its promulgation was not directed against him, but rather against Gerard of Borgo San Donnino. In 1254 Gerard had published without permission a work, &quot;Introductorius in Evangelium æternum&quot; (&quot;An Introduction to the Eternal Gospel&quot;) that was judged heretical within a year. Thereupon the General Chapter of Narbonne promulgated their decree, identical with the &quot;constitutio gravis in contrarium&quot; Bacon speaks of. The prohibition was rescinded in Roger&#x27;s favor unexpectedly in 1266.

Bonaventure was instrumental in procuring the election of Pope Gregory X, who rewarded him with the title of Cardinal Bishop of Albano, and insisted on his presence at the great Second Council of Lyon in 1274. There, after his significant contributions led to a union of the Greek and Latin churches, Bonaventure died suddenly and under suspicious circumstances. The 1913 edition of the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; has citations that suggest he was poisoned, but no mention is made of this in the 2003 second edition of the New Catholic Encyclopedia.

He steered the Franciscans on a moderate and intellectual course that made them the most prominent order in the Catholic Church until the coming of the Jesuits. His theology was marked by an attempt completely to integrate faith and reason. He thought of Christ as the &quot;one true master&quot; who offers humans knowledge that begins in faith, is developed through rational understanding, and is perfected by mystical union with God.

===Relics===
In the year 1434, 160 years after his death, his body was moved to a new church that was considered more fitting. Upon doing so, the head was found to be entirely incorrupt. &quot;The hair, lips, teeth, and tongue were perfectly preserved and retained their natural colour. The people of Lyon were profoundly affected by this miracle, and they chose Bonaventure for the patron of their city. The movement, already afoot, to obtain his canonization received thereby a new and powerful impetus.&quot; However, a century later in 1562, the city of Lyon was captured by Huguenots, who burned Bonaventure&#x27;s body in the public square. In the 19th century, during the &quot;dechristianization of France&quot; during the French Revolution, the urn containing the incorrupt head was hidden, after which the church was razed to the ground. The urn has never been recovered. The only extant relic of Bonaventure is the arm and hand with which he wrote his &quot;Commentary on the Sentences&quot;, which is now conserved at Bagnoregio, in the parish church of St. Nicholas.

==Theology and works==
===Writings===
Bonaventure was formally canonised in 1482 by the Franciscan Pope Sixtus IV, and ranked along with Thomas Aquinas as the greatest of the Doctors of the Church by another Franciscan, Pope Sixtus V, in 1587. Bonaventure was regarded as one of the greatest philosophers of the Middle Ages. His works, as arranged in the most recent Critical Edition by the Quaracchi Fathers (Collegio S. Bonaventura), consist of a &quot;Commentary on the Sentences of Lombard&quot;, in four volumes, and eight other volumes, including a &quot;Commentary on the Gospel of St Luke&quot; and a number of smaller works; the most famous of which are &quot;The Mind&#x27;s Road to God&quot; (&quot;Itinerarium mentis in Deum&quot;), an outline of his theology or &quot;Brief Reading&quot; (&quot;Breviloquium&quot;), &quot;Reduction of the Arts to Theology&quot; (&quot;De reductione artium ad theologiam&quot;), and Soliloquy on the Four Spiritual Exercises (&quot;Soliloquium de quatuor mentalibus exercitiis&quot;), &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; (&quot;Lignum vitae&quot;), and &quot;The Triple Way&quot; (&quot;De Triplici via&quot;), the latter three written for the spiritual direction of his fellow Franciscans.

The German philosopher Dieter Hattrup denies that &quot;Reduction of the Arts to Theology&quot; was written by Bonaventure, claiming that the style of thinking does not match Bonaventure&#x27;s original style. His position is no longer tenable given recent research: the text remains &quot;indubitably authentic&quot;.

A work that for many years was falsely attributed to Bonaventure, &quot;De septem itineribus aeternitatis&quot;, was actually written by Rudolf von Biberach ( – 1329).

For Isabelle of France, the sister of King Louis IX of France, and her monastery of Poor Clares at Longchamps, Bonaventure wrote the treatise &quot;Concerning the Perfection of Life&quot;.

The &quot;Commentary on the&quot; &quot;Sentences&quot;, written at the command of his superiors when he was twenty-seven, is Bonaventure&#x27;s major work and most of his other theological and philosophical writings are in some way dependent on it. However, some of Bonaventure&#x27;s later works, such as the &quot;Lectures on the Six Days of Creation&quot;, show substantial developments beyond the &quot;Sentences&quot;.

===Philosophy===

Bonaventure wrote on almost every subject treated by the Scholastics (see Scholasticism) and his writings are substantial. A great number of them deal with faith in Christ, God and theology. No work of Bonaventure&#x27;s is exclusively philosophical, a striking illustration of the mutual interpenetration of philosophy and theology that is a distinguishing mark of the Scholastic period.

Much of Bonaventure&#x27;s philosophical thought shows a considerable influence by Augustine of Hippo, so much so that De Wulf considers him the best medieval representative of Augustinianism. Bonaventure adds Aristotelian principles to the Augustinian doctrine, especially in connection with the illumination of the intellect and the composition of human beings and other living creatures in terms of matter and form. Augustine, who had introduced into the west many of the doctrines that would define scholastic philosophy, was a critically important source of Bonaventure&#x27;s Platonism. The mystic pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite was another notable influence.

In philosophy, Bonaventure presents a marked contrast to his contemporaries, Roger Bacon, Albert the Great, and Thomas Aquinas. While these may be taken as representing, respectively, physical science yet in its infancy, and Aristotelian scholasticism in its most perfect form, Bonaventure presents the mystical and Platonizing mode of speculation that had already, to some extent, found expression in Hugo and Richard of St. Victor, Alexander of Hales, and in Bernard of Clairvaux. To him, the purely intellectual element, though never absent, is of inferior interest when compared with the living power of the affections or the heart.

Like Thomas Aquinas, with whom he shared numerous profound agreements in matters theological and philosophical, he combated the Aristotelian notion of the eternity of the world vigorously (though he disagreed with Aquinas about the abstract possibility of an eternal universe). Bonaventure accepts the general Christian Neoplatonic doctrine, found in Augustine and pseudo-Dionysius, that &quot;forms&quot; do not exist as subsistent entities, but as ideals, predefinitions, archetypes, or in Bonaventure&#x27;s words: &quot;exemplars&quot;, in the mind of God, according to which actual things were formed. This conception has no slight influence upon his philosophy. Physicist and philosopher Max Bernhard Weinstein described Bonaventure as a &quot;half-mystic&quot; and wrote that he showed &quot;strong pandeistic inclinations&quot;.

===Theology===
Emanationism, exemplarism, and consummation are explicitly listed by Bonaventure as the core principles of theology, all of which are heavily Platonic themes and carry equally Platonic subtopics and discussions but yet are all rooted in the second Person of the Trinity, the Son, incarnate as Jesus Christ, who is the &#x27;principio&#x27; of divine exemplars, from which creation emanates and by which creation is made intelligible and which creation finds as its goal. Creation is two-fold, expressing the divine truth, the divine exemplar in the Word of God; it &quot;speaks&quot; of that which it is the likeness and subsists in itself and in the Son. Bonaventure&#x27;s mature work, the Collationes in Hexaemeron, takes exemplarism, drawn out from his transformation of Platonic Realism, as the basis for vital points of Christian theological dogma: God&#x27;s love of creation, God&#x27;s foreknowledge, providence and divine governance, the unconstrained but perfect will of God, divine justice and the devil, the immortality of and uniqueness of human soul, and the goodness and beauty of creation. This also serves as his repudiation of Arab peripatetic necessitarianism and pure Aristotelian identified by the Greek Fathers, if left uncorrected by Plato and Revelation which teach the same thing under different modes.Upon [rejection of exemplarism], there follows another [error], that is, that God has neither foreknowledge nor providence, since He does not have within Himself a rational justification of things by which He could know them. They also say that there are no truths concerning the future except that of necessary things. And from this it follows that all things come about either by chance or by necessity. And since it is impossible that things come about by chance, the Arabs conclude to absolute necessity, that is, that these substances that move the globe are the necessary causes of all things. From this it follows that truth is hidden, that is, the truth of government of worldly things in terms of pain and glory. If, indeed, these substances are inerrant movers, nothing is supposed concerning hell or the existence of the devil: neither did Aristotle ever suppose the existence of the devil, nor happiness after this life, as it appears. Here, then, there is a threefold error: a concealment of exemplarity, of divine providence and of world government.Like all the great scholastic doctors, Bonaventure starts with the discussion of the relations between reason and faith. All the sciences are but the handmaids of theology; reason can discover some of the moral truths that form the groundwork of the Christian system, but other truths can only be received and apprehended through divine illumination. To obtain this illumination, the soul must employ the proper means, which are prayer; the exercise of the virtues, whereby it is rendered fit to accept the divine light; and meditation that may rise even to ecstatic union with God. The supreme end of life is a union in contemplation or intellect or intense absorbing love; but it cannot be entirely reached in this life, and remains as a hope for the future.

Like Aquinas and other notable thirteenth-century philosophers and theologians, Bonaventure believed that it is possible to logically prove the existence of God and the immortality of the soul. In fact, unlike Aquinas, Bonaventure holds that reason can demonstrate the beginning of the world. He offers several arguments for the existence of God, including versions of Anselm of Canterbury&#x27;s ontological argument and Augustine&#x27;s argument from eternal truths. His main argument for the immortality of the soul appeals to humans&#x27; natural desire for perfect happiness, and is reflected in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s argument from desire. Contrary to Aquinas, Bonaventure did not believe that philosophy was an autonomous discipline that could be pursued successfully independently of theology. Any philosopher is bound to fall into serious error, he believed, who lacks the light of faith.

A master of the memorable phrase, Bonaventure held that philosophy opens the mind to at least three different routes humans can take on their journey to God. Non-intellectual material creatures he conceived as shadows and vestiges (literally, footprints) of God, understood as the ultimate cause of a world that philosophical reason can prove was created at a first moment in time. Intellectual creatures he conceived of as images and likenesses of God, the workings of the human mind and will leading us to God understood as illuminator of knowledge and donor of grace and virtue. The final route to God is the route of being, in which Bonaventure brought Anselm&#x27;s argument together with Aristotelian and Neoplatonic metaphysics to view God as the absolutely perfect being whose essence entails its existence, an absolutely simple being that causes all other, composite beings to exist.

Bonaventure&#x27;s thoughts on our ability to see the Trinity in creation, lost or hampered in the Fall, are recorded and praised by Pope Francis in his encyclical letter, &quot;Laudato si&#x27;&quot;:

Bonaventure, however, is not only a meditative thinker, whose works may form good manuals of devotion; he is a dogmatic theologian of high rank, and on all the disputed questions of scholastic thought, such as universals, matter, seminal reasons, the principle of individuation, or the intellectus agens, he gives weighty and well-reasoned decisions. He agrees with Albert the Great in regarding theology as a practical science; its truths, according to his view, are peculiarly adapted to influence the affections. He discusses very carefully the nature and meaning of the divine attributes; considers universals to be the ideal forms pre-existing in the divine mind according to which things were shaped; holds matter to be pure potentiality that receives individual being and determinateness from the formative power of God, acting according to the ideas; and finally maintains that the agent intellect has no separate existence. On these and on many other points of scholastic philosophy the &quot;Seraphic Doctor&quot; exhibits a combination of subtlety and moderation, which makes his works particularly valuable.

In form and intent the work of Bonaventure is always the work of a theologian; he writes as one for whom the only angle of vision and the proximate criterion of truth is the Christian faith. This fact affects his importance as a philosopher; when coupled with his style, it makes Bonaventure perhaps the least accessible of the major figures of the thirteenth century. This is true because philosophy interests him largely as a &quot;praeparatio evangelica&quot;, as something to be interpreted as a foreshadow of or deviation from what God has revealed.

==Canonisation==
Bonaventure&#x27;s feast day was included in the General Roman Calendar immediately upon his canonisation in 1482. It was at first celebrated on the second Sunday in July, but was moved in 1568 to 14 July, since 15 July, the anniversary of his death, was at that time taken up with the feast of Saint Henry. It remained on that date, with the rank of &quot;double&quot;, until 1960, when it was reclassified as a feast of the third class. In 1969 it was classified as an obligatory memorial and assigned to the date of his death, 15 July.

He is the patron saint of bowel disorders.

Bonaventure is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 15 July.

<text>Clermont County, popularly called Clermont ( ), is a county in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 208,601. Ordinanced in 1800 as part of the Virginia Military District, Clermont is Ohio&#x27;s eighth oldest county, the furthest county west in Appalachian Ohio, and the eleventh oldest county of the former Northwest Territory. Clermont County is part of the Cincinnati, OH-KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area. 
The county is named from the French &quot;clear hills or mountain.&quot;
Its county seat is Batavia, while its largest city is Milford.

==History==
Clermont&#x27;s name is borrowed from a prefecture in France notable as the home of Celtic leader Vercingetorix who led the unified Gallic resistance to Roman invasion. Clermont connotes &quot;clear mountain,&quot; which describes the hills when viewed through the thick Ohio River fog. During the Age of Discovery, the French became the first recorded Europeans to see this land from the Ohio River, though Clermont&#x27;s population dates to the Paleoindian, Adena, Hopewell, and Fort Ancient cultures. The Gatch Site and other sites provide glimpses into what life was like for these people. The Shawnee, Miami, Lenape, Mingo, Odawa, Cherokee, and Wyandot each have or had a presence in Clermont.

At its ordinance in 1800 by the Commonwealth of Virginia to reward Virginian military veterans with land bounties, Clermont encompassed twenty-three current Ohio counties and over 4.2 million acres of dense old-growth forest. The first deed was issued on February 20, 1796. George Washington owned three parcels of land in Clermont County, whose first capital was Williamsburg, founded by William Lytle, and like Milford, was founded in 1796. A stone dairy house, constructed in 1800, is thought to be the oldest standing building in Clermont. The edifice is located beside Harmony Hill on South Third Street in Williamsburg. Harmony Hill, one of the area&#x27;s first farms, was built by William Lytle. The last American Indian village was located two miles south of Marathon in Jackson Township, along the mouth of Grassy Run on the East Fork of the Little Miami River. The site saw the largest frontier battle in Clermont, the Battle of Grassy Run, during which pioneer Simon Kenton clashed with chief Tecumseh on April 10, 1792. The Wyandot lived at this site until 1811. The Bullskin Trail, once a major American Indian trail, runs north and south through Clermont along Ohio Route 133, and was used by frontiersmen Kenton and Daniel Boone on hunting and warfare expeditions. In 1823, New Richmond became the seat, and in 1824, the seat moved to Batavia, the county&#x27;s current seat. Clermont&#x27;s Moscow became the exiled home of French royalty during the early 1800s, including future King of France Louis-Philippe in 1815 and the Marquis de Lafayette in 1825. Point Pleasant was birthplace and boyhood home of military hero, Union general, and President Ulysses S. Grant, born on April 27, 1822.

During the 1800s, antislavery sentiment remained strong. Bethel was the residence of Democratic United States Senator Thomas Morris who also served three terms in the Ohio House of Representatives, as Ohio Supreme Court Justice, and four terms in the Ohio Senate. His U.S. Senate career lasted from 1833 to 1839, and in 1844, Morris was the vice presidential candidate for a third party with the goal of abolishing slavery—approximately sixteen years before the first antislavery Republican president. 

Also in 1844, America&#x27;s first anarchist, philosopher, and inventor Josiah Warren made Clermont the site of Utopia, an egalitarian haven of Puritans who espoused the doctrines of François Marie Charles Fourier. The primitive socialist life at Utopia was later made into a musical at the Carnegie Center of Columbia Tusculum. In 1847, future Ohio Governor John M. Pattison was born near Owensville. Grant became commander-in-chief of the U.S. Army in the Civil War, during which John Hunt Morgan and his Confederate raiders invaded Clermont in 1863. Grant was elected the eighteenth president in 1868.

Clermont&#x27;s last-standing covered bridge was built in 1878 on Stonelick Williams Corner Road, near US Route 50; it was renovated in 2014. The Grant birthplace, originally a one-room cabin, continues to welcome visitors and in 1890 was removed from its original location, travelling by boat to be viewed by citizens along various waterways. It was also taken to the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair before returning to Clermont.

Pattison became the first Clermont Countian elected Governor of Ohio in 1905, Ohio&#x27;s first Democratic governor of the twentieth century. Pattison lived in Milford, and at a time before the influence of Columbus, governed from his home called the Promont, which was used as the official governor&#x27;s residence. The mansion, completed in 1865, today is a museum that houses a library and other historical memorabilia. It is located at 906 Main Street, Milford. Democrat Hugh Llewellyn Nichols of Batavia served as 32nd Lieutenant Governor of Ohio and became the first Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court in 1914. Orpha Gatch of Milford, the first woman elected to its school board, locally sponsored the county LWV, and is the namesake for the club&#x27;s award given annually at its suffragist brunch honoring the recognized volunteerism and leadership qualities. Clermont&#x27;s progressivism created a climate of political independence. Despite recent Republican prevalence in its offices, heavy nonpartisan and union influences exist. Clermont&#x27;s growing population as well as environmentalism have contributed to this climate.

Starting with the 1940 election, it has become more Republican-leaning, with Lyndon B. Johnson being the lone Democrat to win since. Clermont has been visited by recent national ticket candidates from Republicans and Democrats.
















==Communities==
Ohio recognizes municipalities (villages and cities) and townships. 

Each municipality has an elected-nonpartisan council with a designated mayor. Mayors sometimes preside during mayor&#x27;s court and have various other roles. These mayor-council arrangements pass municipal ordinances.

In 1991, the state legislature and George Voinovich adopted &quot;Limited Home Rule Townships&quot; as a schism from the Ohio Constitution&#x27;s Municipal Home Rule established in 1912. The alteration devolved townships which chose limited home rule government to be similar to municipalities but without full home rule, a city code, comprehensive zoning, among a host of other traits. The result is many developed townships which would have sought shared municipal incorporation with cities or villages have not maximized property value and do not have basic support for services and infrastructure, relying exclusively on reduced state funding—much of which comes from federal investments for roadwork. The autonomy which was sought has effectively been unable to reserve responsibility for the community and instead outsourced that responsibility to state intervention.

<doc id="95437" wikidata="Q31091" url="?curid=95437" title="Glacier County, Montana">
<text>Glacier County is located in the U.S. state of Montana. As of the 2020 census, the population was 13,778. The county is located in northwestern Montana between the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains, known to the Blackfeet as the &quot;Backbone of the World&quot;. The county is geographically and culturally diverse and includes the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, Glacier National Park, and Lewis and Clark National Forest. The county is bordered by 75 miles of international boundary with two ports of entry (Piegan and Del Bonita) open year-round and one seasonal (Chief Mountain) international border crossing into Alberta, Canada.

==Settlements==
Several small unincorporated communities, one incorporated town, and one incorporated city are located within the county.

Cut Bank, the county seat with a population of around 3,000, is located in eastern Glacier County, on the edge of the Great Plains. Cut Bank arose from the railway and agricultural needs of the surrounding area, and was fostered by an oil boom in the 1920s. The town&#x27;s diverse population is a result of this settlement. Town resources and services include a hospital and clinic, an historic airport (with regional and international connections), a nine-hole golf course, and a municipal swimming pool. Nearby historical sites from the Lewis and Clark expedition, among other historic and prehistoric locations, can be visited. The Glacier County Museum has a collection of archaeological artifacts, historic buildings, community memorabilia, and a comprehensive archive of early area history and individuals, including a large collection of data on Blackfeet history.

Browning is the home and government seat of the Blackfeet Tribe. The incorporated portion of Browning, at 1,400 residents, does not reflect the total population of around 7,000 in the wider community, largely representative of the Blackfeet Tribe on a part of their ancestral homeland, which dates back over 400 years. Town businesses and resources include a federal building, community college, Native American Museum and Heritage Center, casino, fairgrounds, racetrack, and Native American camp area that hosts an annual Native American celebration and powwow. Many events are held in this area during the summer months. Blackfeet tribal fishing, hunting and recreational permits, along with guide and tour services to blue-ribbon trout fishing (and other recreational opportunities), can be found there.

Babb is a small, unincorporated farming and ranching community on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. The community experiences a large influx of tourists in the summer months, as it is the gateway to the Many Glacier area of Glacier National Park. Community infrastructure includes one school, a US post office, a fire station, and a general store as well as a motel, gas station, several restaurants, and two churches. Nearby attractions include the aforementioned Glacier National Park, the historic Many Glacier Hotel, the St. Mary River and Irrigation Canal, and Chief Mountain, as well as the Piegan and Chief Mountain border crossings with Alberta, Canada.

East Glacier Park Village, a small winter community, grows in the summertime with many visitors and the summer workforce, hailing from all parts of the globe to meet the needs of the larger population. It is the site of the largest of Glacier Park&#x27;s historic hotels and its fleet of &quot;red buses&quot;. It has a nine-hole golf course, campgrounds, trail rides, boat rides, and native interpretive tours.

St. Mary is an unincorporated community on the western border of the Blackfeet Native American Reservation, located adjacent to Glacier National Park. The village is the eastern terminus of the Going-to-the-Sun Road which bisects the park east-to-west at a length of . Fewer than 50 people reside in the village year-round; however, the population increases tenfold on a busy summer evening. It has several lodges, restaurants and cafés, a small grocery store, two gas stations and campgrounds. A large housing area for National Park Service personnel is located adjacent to the village, within the park. U.S. Route 89 passes through the village, which lies between Saint Mary Lake in Glacier National Park and Lower St. Mary Lake on the Blackfeet Native American Reservation.

Starr School is a census-designated place (CDP) in Glacier County. The population was 252 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.3%) is water. About 71% of the county&#x27;s land area lies within the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. Another 21% lies within Glacier National Park in western Glacier County.

* Flathead County - west
* Pondera County - south
* Toole County - east
* Cardston County, Alberta - north
* Improvement District No. 4, Alberta (Waterton Lakes National Park) - northwest
* County of Warner No. 5, Alberta - northeast
===National protected areas===
* Glacier National Park (part)
* Lewis and Clark National Forest (part)

==Politics==
Owing largely to its majority Native American population, Glacier County generally votes strongly Democratic, in contrast with most other rural Montana counties, which trend Republican. Democratic strength lies in the western and central portions of the county in the Blackfeet Reservation, including the city of Browning. However, the eastern portion of the county, including Cut Bank, votes strongly Republican. In most recent elections, Glacier has been the most Democratic county in the state. 

In the 2024 election, Glacier county saw a shift toward the Republican party, the strongest such shift of all Montana counties. This mirrored other counties in Montana with high Native American populations, such as Blaine, Roosevelt and Big Horn, which all flipped or leaned more Republican after 2020. While Kamala Harris still easily won the county, this was the first time that Glacier County voted to the right of Missoula County since 1980.

<doc id="95440" wikidata="Q496607" url="?curid=95440" title="Flathead County, Montana">
<text>Flathead County is a county located in the U.S. state of Montana. At the 2020 census, its population was 104,357, making it the state&#x27;s fourth most populous county. Its county seat is Kalispell. Its numerical designation (used in the issuance of license plates) is 7. Its northern border is on the state&#x27;s north border, making it contiguous with the Canada–US border, facing British Columbia.

Flathead County comprises the Kalispell, Montana Micropolitan Statistical Area, with neighboring Lake County following soon after.

==History==
Flathead County was founded in 1893. Some sources cite the supposed practice of the Salish tribe flattening infants&#x27; heads as the origin of the name Flathead, but there is no record of Salish Indians ever having that appearance.

==Geography==
The county includes much of Flathead Lake, the Flathead Valley, and the Flathead River. These natural treasures were created by glacial activity which ended approximately 10,000 years ago. The Flathead Valley is the southern extension of a prominent valley called the Rocky Mountain Trench, which runs from the Yukon Territory in Canada as far south as Flathead Lake. The Trench in northwestern Montana was created by subsidence along a major extensional fault, which continues today. After the valley formed, glaciers flowing down the Trench from British Columbia, and into it from the surrounding mountain ranges left a flat valley floor and dammed the Flathead River drainage to create Flathead Lake. Several tribes have long used the Flathead Lake, and the Bitterroot Salish, Kootenai, and Pend d&#x27;Oreilles tribes are represented on the Flathead Reservation. The western part of Glacier National Park is located in the county.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.2%) is water. It is the third-largest county in Montana by land area and second-largest by total area.

===Ecology===
Wildlife includes bobcats, black bears, coyotes, deer, elk, grizzly bears, lynx, mountain lions, and wolves.

==Government and politics==
Along with neighboring Silver Bow county, Anaconda-Deer Lodge has been a consolidated city-county since 1977, the only two in Montana. The incumbent chief executive officer of Anaconda-Deer Lodge is Bill Everett, who was elected in 2017. 

Deer Lodge County is the most consistently Democratic county in Montana when it comes to presidential elections. It has not supported a Republican candidate since Calvin Coolidge in 1924. In 2016, Hillary Clinton failed to garner a majority of the votes, becoming the first Democrat not to obtain a majority since 1924. In 2020, the county once again gave the Democratic candidate (Joe Biden) the majority, when he won 52% of the vote. However, in 2024, Kamala Harris carried the county by only 47 votes, or less than 1%, winning a plurality of 48.79%. This was an even narrower edge than in 2016; Donald Trump&#x27;s performance in this election was the best by a Republican in the county since 1956. In gubernatorial elections the most recent Republican to carry the county was Marc Racicot in the 1996 election. In that election the original Democratic nominee, Chet Blaylock, died and Marc Racicot carried every county.

Deer Lodge County is currently in the 39th district of the Montana Senate along with Granite County and portions of Powell and Silver Bow counties. It has been represented by Republican Terry Vermeire since 2023, having flipped the traditionally Democratic seat by a 752 vote margin. Vermeire defeated Democrat Jesse Mullen, executive of the Mullen Newspaper Company from Deer Lodge (city) in the 2022 special election. Jessica Wicks, Democratic incumbent appointed to fulfill Mark Sweeney&#x27;s term following his May 2022 death, did not win appointment from the local Democratic Party to be their November nominee.

In the Montana House of Representatives, most of the county is in the 77th district and has been represented by Republican John Fitzpatrick since 2023, who won an upset against incumbent Democrat Sara Novak by a margin of 47. This marks the first time since 1945 that Anaconda has been represented by a Republican in the state House of Representatives. Part of the county is also in the 78th district, represented by Republican Gregory Frazer.

From 2024 to 2033, Deer Lodge County will be in House District 71 (along with Walkerville) and Senate District 36 (along with Walkerville and part of Butte). These districts are expected to be more Democratic than the current districts used since 2014.

<text>Dawson County is a county located in the U.S. state of Montana. As of the 2020 census, the population was 8,940. Its county seat is Glendive.

==History==
Dawson County was the tenth county organized in Montana Territory. It was created January 15, 1869, four and a half years after Montana Territory was organized. Before the formation of Dawson county, the area was the northern half of the original Big Horn County. Dawson takes its name from Major Andrew Dawson, manager of the Fort Benton Trading Post for the American Fur Company from 1856 to 1864.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water.

Dawson County is located in the extreme eastern portion of Montana, about fifteen to twenty miles west of the Dakota line.

Dawson County contains part of Montana&#x27;s badlands. Makoshika State Park is an example of that area&#x27;s unusual rock formations. Dawson County&#x27;s principal water sources are the Yellowstone River, which bisects its southeastern section, and the Redwater River in its northwest corner. Numerous creeks are tributary to these streams, furnishing abundant and accessible facilities watering livestock and for small irrigation enterprises and water conservation projects. In the upper bench lands, artesian well irrigation has received considerable attention.

The largest Triceratops skull ever found was discovered in 1992 and excavated in 2003 in Dawson County, Montana, in the famous Hell Creek Formation. It is a 65-million-year-old male Triceratops skull, 9.2 feet long, 5.2 feet high and 4.6 feet wide and weighing over 600 kg. It has been dubbed &#x27;Dragon King&#x27; and is understood to be the most expensive skull to ever trade privately.

Parts of Dawson County were taken to form Valley County in 1893, Richland County and part of Wibaux County in 1914, part of Prairie County in 1915, and Garfield County and part of McCone County in 1919.

==Politics==












==Economy==
Dawson County is known for its dryland grain, coal mines and gas and oil wells. There are 522 current farms and ranches, and 296 commercial businesses.

Lying in the heart of the western third of the Fort Union region, Dawson County is plentifully supplied with lignite coal. Local natural gas has supplied Glendive since at least 1920. Excellent clays for pottery and brick-making are also found in the county.

From early days, Dawson County was known as a splendid stock county, because of the native cover of a heavy and nutritious grass. Unlike some other parts of the state, the livestock industry did not die out. In the early 20th century, the county was known for pure-bred stock raising, dairying, and the production of hogs and poultry.

While there is some broken land around the Sheep Bluffs, in the northwestern part of the county, and east of the Yellowstone, smooth prairies and rolling land predominated in the county, making conditions excellent for farming purposes. The dark sandy loam soil, with a heavy clay subsoil, was a big producer.

The principal crops in the early years of the 20th century were barley, oats and wheat. Sixty per cent of the land was tillable, and the remainder afforded good grazing. As of 1920, the headgates of the Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Project, which irrigated approximately 90,000 acres, were located at Intake, in Dawson County, and further irrigation was planned. Unirrigated land was also producing excellent crops, with up to 400 bushels of potatoes in one acre of unirrigated land. In 1915, Dawson County won first and second prizes on Northwestern Dent corn at the St. Paul Corn Show, and in December of the following year, at the First National Corn Show, held at the same city, took first and second prizes and three third prizes. In 1920, it was estimated that the acreage planted in corn in Dawson County alone was as great as the corn acreage for the entire state in 1910.

<text>Cascade County (&quot;cascade&quot; means &quot;waterfall&quot; in French) is a county located in the U.S. state of Montana. As of the 2020 census, the population was 84,414, making it the fifth-most populous county in Montana. Its county seat is Great Falls.

Cascade County comprises the Great Falls, MT Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
At the time of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Cascade County was the territory of the Blackfeet. The county was named for the falls on the Missouri River.

The United States Army once had Fort Shaw as an outpost in the northwest part of the county. Only a small settlement, a CDP, remains by that name.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water. The Missouri River and the Sun River flow through the county, and meet at the city of Great Falls. A portion of the Adel Mountains Volcanic Field is in the county&#x27;s southwest corner. The Rocky Mountains are in the western part of the county, with the Little Belt and Highwood Mountains in the southeast.

===Adjacent counties===

* Teton County - northwest
* Chouteau County - northeast
* Judith Basin County - east
* Meagher County - south
* Lewis and Clark County - west
===National protected areas===
* Benton Lake National Wildlife Refuge
* Lewis and Clark National Forest (part)

==Demographics==
===2020 census===
As of the 2020 census, 84,414 people were living in the county.

===2010 census===
As of the 2010 census, 81,327 people, 33,809 households, and 21,403 families in the county. The population density was . There were 37,276 housing units at an average density of . The county&#x27;s racial makeup was 89.2% white, 4.3% American Indian, 1.2% black or African American, 0.8% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.6% other races, and 3.6% from two or more races. Those of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 3.3% of the population. In terms of ancestry, 28.5% were German, 17.1% were Irish, 12.3% were English, 10.3% were Norwegian, and 4.5% were American.

Of the 33,809 households, 29.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.4% were married couples living together, 10.2% had a female householder with no husband present, 36.7% were non-families, and 30.5% of all households were made up of individuals. The average household size was 2.33 and the average family size was 2.90. The median age was 38.9 years.

The median income for a household in the county was $42,389, and the median income for a family was $53,540. Males had a median income of $37,904 versus $27,944 for females. The per capita income for the county was $22,963. About 10.9% of families and 13.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 20.4% of those under age 18 and 8.8% of those age 65 or over.

==Politics==
Like Lewis &amp; Clark County to the west, Cascade County leans Republican but has voted for Democrats four times since Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s landslide in 1964. Hubert Humphrey easily won this county in 1968, one of nine counties he won. Barack Obama carried Cascade in 2008 but lost to Mitt Romney in 2012 by 9%. Since 2012, the county has voted Republican by comfortable margins. In 2020, Donald Trump won the county with over 58% of the vote, the best performance by a Republican since 1920. The county continued this trend in 2024, when Trump won nearly 60% of the vote.

In statewide races, Cascade County often acts as a bellwether county. It has been friendlier to Democrats - Senator Max Baucus carried the county in all of his elections, and Governors Brian Schweitzer and Steve Bullock carried it in all four elections in 2004–2016. Since at least 1984, no Democrat has won in Montana without winning Cascade County, however, Republicans have occasionally won statewide without carrying the county, such as former Senator Conrad Burns in 1988 and 2000, Governors Marc Racicot in 1992 and Judy Martz in 2000, Secretaries of State Bob Brown in 2000 and Brad Johnson in 2004, and Attorney General Tim Fox in 2012.

The racial makeup of the county was 49.4% American Indian, 48.2% white, 0.1% black or African American, 0.1% Asian, 0.2% from other races, and 2.0% from two or more races. Those of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 1.8% of the population. In terms of ancestry, 23.0% were German, 9.2% were Norwegian, 6.6% were Irish, 5.7% were English, and 2.0% were American.

==Politics==
Blaine County is the nation&#x27;s most consistent long-term bellwether county, having voted for the winning presidential candidate in all but two elections held in its history. After backing Theodore Roosevelt against Woodrow Wilson in the county&#x27;s inaugural 1912 election, Blaine County has been won by the winner of the presidential election in every election except that of 1988, held during the aftermath of a major drought and farm crisis; Michael Dukakis won the county by 58 votes. During two other drought years on the Great Plains, Adlai Stevenson II in 1956 and Gerald Ford in 1976 also came close to breaking the county&#x27;s streak, losing by even smaller vote margins than George H. W. Bush. The county&#x27;s swing status comes from the fact that it contains the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, which trends Democratic, with the rest of the county voting strongly Republican. Since 2016, the trends on the Reservation have been a heavy factor in the county&#x27;s leaning. The strongest Democratic shift in the county in 2020 and in turn the strongest Republican shift in 2024 each occurred on the Reservation, while the rest of the county simply shifted slightly more Republican in both. This pushed the county majority to go to Biden in 2020 and to Trump in 2024.











==Economy==
The main industry in Blaine County is agriculture. The main employers on the Reservation are the Gros Ventre and Assiniboine tribes.

==Education==
Aaniiih Nakoda College (formerly Fort Belknap College) is located on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. Public high schools in the county include Harlem High School in Harlem, Chinook High School in Chinook, and Turner High School in Turner.

<text>In Māori mythology the primal couple Rangi and Papa (or Ranginui and Papatūānuku) appear in a creation myth explaining the origin of the world and the Māori people (though there are many different versions). In some South Island dialects, Rangi is called Raki or Rakinui.

==Union and separation==
Ranginui first married Poharua Te Po where they bore 3 offspring including Aorangi (or Aoraki as given in South Island). He later married Papatūānuku together becoming the primordial sky father and earth mother bearing over 500 children of male and female including Tāwhirimātea, Tāne and Tangaroa. Both Ranginui and Papatūānuku lie locked together in a tight embrace, and their sons forced to live in the cramped darkness between them.

These children grow and discuss among themselves what it would be like to live in the light. Tūmatauenga, the fiercest of the children, proposes that the best solution to their predicament is to kill their parents. But his brother Tāne disagrees, suggesting that it is better to push them apart, to let Ranginui be as a stranger to them in the sky above while Papatūānuku will remain below to nurture them. The others put their plans into action—Rongo, the god of cultivated food, tries to push his parents apart, then Tangaroa, the god of the sea, and his sibling Haumia-tiketike, the god of wild food, join him. In spite of their joint efforts Rangi and Papa remain close together in their loving embrace.

After many attempts Tāne, god of forests and birds, forces his parents apart. Instead of standing upright and pushing with his hands as his brothers have done, he lies on his back and pushes with his strong legs. Stretching every sinew Tāne pushes and pushes until, with cries of grief and surprise, Ranginui and Papatūānuku were pried apart. Traditions of the Taranaki region, however, assign this separating role to Tangaroa, god of the sea.

==War in heaven and earth==
And so the children of Ranginui and Papatūanuku see light and have space to move for the first time. While the other children have agreed to the separation, Tāwhirimātea, the god of storms and winds, is angered that the parents have been torn apart. He cannot bear to hear the cries of his parents nor see the tears of Ranginui as they are parted, he promises his siblings that from henceforth they will have to deal with his anger. He flies off to join Rangi and there carefully fosters his own many offspring who include the winds, one of whom is sent to each quarter of the compass. To fight his brothers, Tāwhirimātea gathers an army of his children —winds and clouds of different kinds, including fierce squalls, whirlwinds, gloomy thick clouds, fiery clouds, hurricane clouds and thunderstorm clouds, and rain, mists and fog. As these winds show their might the dust flies and the great forest trees of Tāne are smashed under the attack and fall to the ground, food for decay and for insects.
Then Tāwhirimātea attacks the oceans and huge waves rise, whirlpools form, and Tangaroa, the god of the sea, flees in panic. Punga, a son of Tangaroa, has two children, Ikatere father of fish, and Tū-te-wehiwehi (or Tu-te-wanawana) the ancestor of reptiles. Terrified by Tāwhirimātea&#x27;s onslaught the fish seek shelter in the sea and the reptiles in the forests. Ever since Tangaroa has been angry with Tāne for giving refuge to his runaway children. So it is that Tāne supplies the descendants of Tūmatauenga with canoes, fishhooks and nets to catch the descendants of Tangaroa. Tangaroa retaliates by swamping canoes and sweeping away houses, land and trees that are washed out to sea in floods.

Tāwhirimātea next attacks his brothers Rongo and Haumia-tiketike, the gods of cultivated and uncultivated foods. Rongo and Haumia are in great fear of Tāwhirimātea but, as he attacks them, Papatūānuku determines to keep these for her other children and hides them so well that Tāwhirimātea cannot find them. So Tāwhirimātea turns on his brother Tūmatauenga. He uses all his strength but Tūmatauenga stands fast and Tāwhirimatea cannot prevail against him. Tū (or human kind) stands fast and, at last, the anger of the gods subsided and peace prevailed.

Tū thought about the actions of Tāne in separating their parents and made snares to catch the birds, the children of Tāne who could no longer fly free. He then made nets from forest plants and casts them in the sea so that the children of Tangaroa soon lie in heaps on the shore. He made hoes to dig the ground, capturing his brothers Rongo and Haumia-tiketike where they have hidden from Tāwhirimātea in the bosom of the earth mother and, recognising them by their long hair that remains above the surface of the earth, he drags them forth and heaps them into baskets to be eaten. So Tūmatauenga eats all of his brothers to repay them for their cowardice; the only brother that Tūmatauenga does not subdue is Tāwhirimātea, whose storms and hurricanes attack humankind to this day.

There was one more child of Ranginui and Papatūānuku who was never born and still lives inside Papatūanuku. Whenever this child is kicking the earth shakes and it causes an earthquake. Rūaumoko is his name and he is the god of earthquakes and volcanoes. 

==Yearning==
Tāne searched for heavenly bodies as lights so that his father would be appropriately dressed. He obtained the stars and threw them up, along with the moon and the sun. At last Ranginui looked handsome. Ranginui and Papatūanuku continue to grieve for each other to this day. Ranginui&#x27;s tears fall towards Papatūanuku to show how much he loves her. Sometimes Papatūanuku heaves and strains and almost breaks herself apart to reach her beloved partner again but it is to no avail. When mist rises from the forests, these are Papatūānuku&#x27;s sighs as the warmth of her body yearns for Ranginui and continues to nurture mankind.

<text>In Māori mythology, Tāne (also called Tāne-mahuta, Tāne-nui-a-Rangi, Tāne-te-waiora and several other names) is the god of forests and of birds, and the son of Ranginui and Papatūānuku, the sky father and the earth mother, who used to lie in a tight embrace where their many children lived in the darkness between them (Grey 1956:2).

On Tahiti, Tane was the god of peace and beauty.

==Separates his parents==

The children of Rangi and Papa grew frustrated at their confinement in the cramped space between their parents. Tū, future god of war, proposes that they should kill their parents. But Tāne (or Tāne-mahuta) disagrees, suggesting that it is better to separate them, sending Rangi into the sky and leaving Papa below to care for them. Tāne&#x27;s brothers Rongo, then Tangaroa, Haumia-tiketike and Tū all try in vain to separate the parents. After many tries, Tāne lies on his back and pushes with his strong legs, and finally forces his parents apart, and Rangi rises high into the heavens (Grey 1956:2-3). Then Tāne searched for heavenly bodies as lights so that his father would be appropriately dressed. He obtained the stars and threw them up, along with the Moon and the Sun. At last Rangi looked handsome (Orbell 1998:145).

Tāwhirimātea, the god of storms and winds, is angry that the parents have been torn apart. He joins his father in the sky and punishes the earth and sea with violent storms (Grey 1956:3-6, Tregear 1891:54). Tāwhirimātea attacks the forests of Tāne, snapping the trunks of the trees, shattering the trees to the ground, leaving them as food for decay and insects. Then he attacks the oceans, and Tangaroa, the god of the sea, flees. Two of Tangaroa&#x27;s descendants, Ikatere, father of fish and Tu-te-wehiwehi (or Tu-te-wanawana), the ancestor of reptiles, are terrified by Tāwhirimātea&#x27;s fury. The fish flee into the sea, and the reptiles into the forests. Ever since, Tangaroa has resented Tāne for hiding his runaway children. So it is that Tāne supplies the descendants of Tūmatauenga with canoes, fishhooks, and nets to catch the descendants of Tangaroa. Tangaroa retaliates by overturning canoes and sending floods that sweep away houses, land and trees (Grey 1971:5-6).

==Progenitor of humankind==
Some legends say that Tāne made the first man, named Tiki. More widely known is a tradition that Tāne was trying to find himself a wife, but at first he found only non-human females and fathered insects, birds, and plants. One such was Rangahore, who gave birth to a stone and was abandoned by Tāne. Then he made a woman by moulding her from the soil (Orbell 1998:145).

In some stories, Tāne marries his daughter Hine-tītama without her knowing who he is. Upon discovering that she has married her father, she flees to the underworld, and becomes the goddess of death, Hine-nui-te-pō. Tāne follows her and begs her to return. She tells him to return to the world and raise their children, while she will wait below to receive them when they die (Orbell 1998:38).

Other traditions tell of the three baskets of knowledge that Tāne brought down from the heavens (Orbell 1998:145).

<text>In Māori mythology, Rehua is a very sacred personage, who lives in Te Putahi-nui-o-Rehua in Rangi-tuarea, the tenth and highest of the heavens in some versions of Māori lore. Rehua is identified with certain stars. To the Tūhoe people of the North Island he is Antares. Others say he is Betelgeuse, or Sirius. Because he lives in the highest of the skies, Rehua is untouched by death, and has the power to cure blindness, revive the dead, and heal any disease (Orbell 1998:119-120). He is a son of Rangi and Papa, and the father of Rūhi-te-rangi
(mythology)|Kaitangata]], as well as the ancestor of Māui (Tregear 1891:381). A Ngāi Tahu legend from the South Island speaks of Rehua as the eldest son of Rangi and Papa, who first manifested as lightning, but assumed a human shape when he travelled into the skies. Later his brother Tāne went to pay him a visit, Rehua had birds in his hair, feeding on his lice. Rehua had his servants cook and prepare the birds as a meal for Tāne, who was shocked and declined to eat them because the birds had eaten the lice from Rehua&#x27;s head, which was extremely tapu (sacred). However Rehua gave him birds to bring down to this world, and showed him how to snare them. Tāne also brought with him the fruit trees that the birds fed on, and so it is that there are forests and birds on the earth (Orbell 1998:119).

In Tahiti, Rehua was a star-god, the star of the New Year, who produced the Twins as well as the Pleiades, and was considered the lord of the year.

<text>In cell biology, the centrosome (Latin centrum &#x27;center&#x27; + Greek sōma &#x27;body&#x27;) (archaically cytocentre) is an organelle that serves as the main microtubule organizing center (MTOC) of the animal cell, as well as a regulator of cell-cycle progression. The centrosome provides structure for the cell. The centrosome is thought to have evolved only in the metazoan lineage of eukaryotic cells. Fungi and plants lack centrosomes and therefore use other structures to organize their microtubules. Although the centrosome has a key role in efficient mitosis in animal cells, it is not essential in certain fly and flatworm species.

Centrosomes are composed of two centrioles arranged at right angles to each other, and surrounded by a dense, highly structured mass of protein termed the pericentriolar material (PCM). The PCM contains proteins responsible for microtubule nucleation and anchoring — including γ-tubulin, pericentrin and ninein. In general, each centriole of the centrosome is based on a nine-triplet microtubule assembled in a cartwheel structure, and contains centrin, cenexin and tektin.
In many cell types, the centrosome is replaced by a cilium during cellular differentiation. However, once the cell starts to divide, the cilium is replaced again by the centrosome.

==History==
The centrosome was discovered jointly by Walther Flemming in 1875 and Edouard Van Beneden in 1876, and later described and named in 1888 by Theodor Boveri.

==Functions==
 
Centrosomes are associated with the nuclear membrane during the prophase stage of the cell cycle. During mitosis, the nuclear membrane breaks down, and the centrosome-nucleated microtubules can interact with the chromosomes to build the mitotic spindle.

The mother centriole, the older of the two in the centriole pair, also has a central role in making cilia and flagella.

The centrosome is copied only once per cell cycle, so that each daughter cell inherits one centrosome, containing two structures called centrioles. The centrosome replicates during the S phase of the cell cycle. During the prophase in the process of cell division called mitosis, the centrosomes migrate to opposite poles of the cell. The mitotic spindle then forms between the two centrosomes. Upon division, each daughter cell receives one centrosome. Aberrant numbers of centrosomes in a cell have been associated with cancer. Doubling of a centrosome is similar to DNA replication in two respects: the semiconservative nature of the process and the action of CDK2 as a regulator of the process. But the processes are essentially different in that centrosome doubling does not occur by template reading and assembly. The mother centriole just aids in the accumulation of materials required for the assembly of the daughter centriole.

Centrioles, however, are not required for the progression of mitosis. When the centrioles are irradiated by a laser, mitosis proceeds normally with a morphologically normal spindle. Moreover, development of the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila&quot; is largely normal when centrioles are absent due to a mutation in a gene required for their duplication. In the absence of the centrioles, the microtubules of the spindle are focused by motors, allowing the formation of a bipolar spindle. Many cells can completely undergo interphase without centrioles.

Unlike centrioles, centrosomes are required for survival of the organism. Cells without centrosomes lack radial arrays of astral microtubules. They are also defective in spindle positioning and in the ability to establish a central localization site in cytokinesis. The function of centrosomes in this context is hypothesized to ensure the fidelity of cell division, because it greatly increases the efficacy. Some cell types arrest in the following cell cycle when centrosomes are absent. This is not a universal phenomenon.

When the nematode &quot;C. elegans&quot; egg is fertilized, the sperm delivers a pair of centrioles. These centrioles will form the centrosomes, which will direct the first cell division of the zygote, and this will determine its polarity. It&#x27;s not yet clear whether the role of the centrosome in polarity determination is microtubule-dependent or independent.

In human reproduction, the sperm supplies the centriole that creates the centrosome and microtubule system of the zygote.

== Centrosome alterations in cancer cells ==

Theodor Boveri, in 1914, described centrosome aberrations in cancer cells. This initial observation was subsequently extended to many types of human tumors. Centrosome alterations in cancer can be divided in two subgroups — i.e., structural or numeric aberrations — yet both can be found simultaneously in a tumor.

=== Structural aberrations ===
Usually, structural aberrations appear due to uncontrolled expression of centrosome components, or due to post-translational modifications (such as phosphorylations) that are not adequate for the components. These modifications may produce variations in centrosome size (usually too large, due to an excess of pericentriolar material). In addition, because centrosomal proteins have a tendency to form aggregates, centrosome-related bodies (CRBs) are often observed in ectopic places. Both enlarged centrosomes and CRBs are similar to the centrosomal structures observed in tumors. Even more, these structures can be induced in culture cells by overexpression of specific centrosomal proteins, such as CNap-1 or Nlp. These structures may look very similar, yet detailed studies reveal that they may present very different properties, depending on their proteic composition. For instance, their capacity to incorporate γ-TuRC complexes (see also: γ-tubulin) can be very variable, and so their capacity to nucleate microtubules therefore affects the shape, polarity and motility of implicated tumor cells in different ways.

=== Numeric aberrations ===
The presence of an inadequate number of centrosomes is very often linked to the appearance of genome instability and the loss of tissue differentiation. However, the method to count the centrosome number (with two centrioles to each centrosome) is often not very precise, because it is frequently assessed using fluorescence microscopy, which does not have high enough optical resolution to resolve centrioles that are very close to each other. Nevertheless, it is clear that the presence of an excess of centrosomes is a common event in human tumors. It has been observed that loss of the tumor-suppressor p53 produces superfluous centrosomes, as well as deregulating other proteins implicated in cancer formation in humans, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. (For references, see .) An excess of centrosomes can be generated by very different mechanisms: specific reduplication of the centrosome, cytokinesis failure during cell division (generating an increase in chromosome number), cell fusion (such as in cases of infection by specific viruses) or &quot;de novo&quot; generation of centrosomes. At this point, there is insufficient information to know how prevalent these mechanisms are &quot;in vivo&quot;, but it is possible that the increase in centrosome numbers due to a failure during cell division might be more frequent than appreciated, because many &quot;primary&quot; defects in one cell (deregulation of the cell cycle, defective DNA or chromatin metabolism, failure in the spindle checkpoint, etc.) would generate a failure in cell division, an increase in ploidy and an increase in centrosome numbers as a &quot;secondary&quot; effect.

==Evolution==
The evolutionary history of the centrosome and the centriole has been traced for some of the signature genes — e.g., the centrins. Centrins participate in calcium signaling and are required for centriole duplication. There exist two main subfamilies of centrins, both of which are present in the early-branching eukaryote &quot;Giardia intestinalis&quot;. Centrins have therefore been present in the common ancestor of eukaryotes. Conversely, they have no recognizable homologs in archea and bacteria and are thus part of the &quot;eukaryotic signature genes&quot;. Although there are studies on the evolution of the centrins and centrioles, no studies have been published on the evolution of the pericentriolar material.

It is evident that some parts of the centrosome are highly diverged in the model species &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; and &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;. For example, both species have lost one of the centrin subfamilies that are usually associated with centriole duplication. &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; mutants that lack centrosomes can even develop to morphologically normal adult flies, which then die shortly after birth because their sensory neurons lack cilia. Thus, these flies have evolved functionally redundant machinery, which is independent of the centrosomes.

==Associated nucleotides==

Research in 2006 indicated that centrosomes from Atlantic surf clam eggs contain RNA sequences. The sequences identified were found in &quot;few to no&quot; other places in the cell, and do not appear in existing genome databases. One identified RNA sequence contains a putative RNA polymerase, leading to the hypothesis of an RNA-based genome within the centrosome. However, subsequent research has shown that centrosome do not contain their own DNA-based genomes. While it was confirmed that RNA molecules associate with centrosomes, the sequences have still been found within the nucleus. Furthermore, centrosomes can form &quot;de novo&quot; after having been removed (e.g., by laser irradiation) from normal cells.

<text>In mathematics, Stirling numbers arise in a variety of analytic and combinatorial problems. They are named after James Stirling, who introduced them in a purely algebraic setting in his book &quot;Methodus differentialis&quot; (1730). They were rediscovered and given a combinatorial meaning by Masanobu Saka in his 1782 &quot;Sanpō-Gakkai&quot; &quot;(The Sea of Learning on Mathematics)&quot;.

Two different sets of numbers bear this name: the Stirling numbers of the first kind and the Stirling numbers of the second kind. Additionally, Lah numbers are sometimes referred to as Stirling numbers of the third kind. Each kind is detailed in its respective article, this one serving as a description of relations between them.

A common property of all three kinds is that they describe coefficients relating three different sequences of polynomials that frequently arise in combinatorics. Moreover, all three can be defined as the number of partitions of &quot;n&quot; elements into &quot;k&quot; non-empty subsets, where each subset is endowed with a certain kind of order (no order, cyclical, or linear).

==Notation==

Several different notations for Stirling numbers are in use. Ordinary (signed) Stirling numbers of the first kind are commonly denoted:

: formula_1
Unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind, which count the number of permutations of &quot;n&quot; elements with &quot;k&quot; disjoint cycles, are denoted:

: formula_2
Stirling numbers of the second kind, which count the number of ways to partition a set of &quot;n&quot; elements into &quot;k&quot; nonempty subsets:

: formula_3 for the falling factorial and formula_4 for the rising factorial are also often used. (Confusingly, the Pochhammer symbol that many use for &quot;falling&quot; factorials is used in special functions for &quot;rising&quot; factorials.)

Similarly, the rising factorial, defined as formula_5 is a polynomial in of degree whose expansion is

:formula_6

with unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind as coefficients.
One of these expansions can be derived from the other by observing that formula_7 

Stirling numbers of the second kind express the reverse relations:

:formula_8

and

:formula_9

==As change of basis coefficients==
Considering the set of polynomials in the (indeterminate) variable &quot;x&quot; as a vector space,
each of the three sequences
:formula_10
is a basis.
That is, every polynomial in &quot;x&quot; can be written as a sum formula_11 for some unique coefficients formula_12 (similarly for the other two bases).
The above relations then express the change of basis between them, as summarized in the following commutative diagram:
The coefficients for the two bottom changes are described by the Lah numbers below.
Since coefficients in any basis are unique, one can define Stirling numbers this way, as the coefficients expressing polynomials of one basis in terms of another, that is, the unique numbers relating formula_13 with falling and rising factorials as above.

Falling factorials define, up to scaling, the same polynomials as binomial coefficients: formula_14. The changes between the standard basis formula_15 and the basis formula_16 are thus described by similar formulas:
: formula_17

This can be proved by induction.

For example, the sum of fourth powers of integers up to &quot;n&quot; (this time with &quot;n&quot; included), is:

:formula_18

Here the Stirling numbers can be computed from their definition as the number of partitions of 4 elements into &quot;k&quot; non-empty unlabeled subsets.

In contrast, the sum formula_19 in the standard basis is given by Faulhaber&#x27;s formula, which in general is more complicated.

==As inverse matrices==
The Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds can be considered inverses of one another:

:formula_20

and

:formula_21

where formula_22 is the Kronecker delta. These two relationships may be understood to be matrix inverse relationships. That is, let &quot;s&quot; be the lower triangular matrix of Stirling numbers of the first kind, whose matrix elements
formula_23
The inverse of this matrix is &quot;S&quot;, the lower triangular matrix of Stirling numbers of the second kind, whose entries are formula_24 Symbolically, this is written

:formula_25

Although &quot;s&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are infinite, so calculating a product entry involves an infinite sum, the matrix multiplications work because these matrices are lower triangular, so only a finite number of terms in the sum are nonzero.

==Lah numbers==
{{main|Lah numbers}}

The Lah numbers formula_26 are sometimes called Stirling numbers of the third kind.
By convention, formula_27 and formula_28 if formula_29 or formula_30.

These numbers are coefficients expressing falling factorials in terms of rising factorials and vice versa:
:formula_31 and formula_32

As above, this means they express the change of basis between the bases formula_33 and formula_34, completing the diagram.
In particular, one formula is the inverse of the other, thus:

: formula_35

Similarly, composing the change of basis from formula_36 to formula_13 with the change of basis from formula_13 to formula_39 gives the change of basis directly from formula_36 to formula_39:

:formula_42

and similarly for other compositions. In terms of matrices, if formula_43 denotes the matrix with entries formula_44 and formula_45 denotes the matrix with entries formula_46, then one is the inverse of the other: formula_47.
Composing the matrix of unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind with the matrix of Stirling numbers of the second kind gives the Lah numbers: formula_48.

Enumeratively, formula_49 can be defined as the number of partitions of &quot;n&quot; elements into &quot;k&quot; non-empty unlabeled subsets, where each subset is endowed with no order, a cyclic order, or a linear order, respectively. In particular, this implies the inequalities:
: formula_50

==Inversion relations and the Stirling transform==

For any pair of sequences, formula_51 and formula_52, related by a finite sum Stirling number formula given by

:formula_53

for all integers formula_54, we have a corresponding inversion formula for formula_55 given by

:formula_56

The lower indices could be any integer between formula_57 and formula_58.

These inversion relations between the two sequences translate into functional equations between the sequence exponential generating functions given by the Stirling (generating function) transform as

:formula_59

and

:formula_60

For formula_61, the differential operators formula_62 and formula_63 are related by the following formulas for all integers formula_54:

:formula_65

Another pair of &quot;inversion&quot; relations involving the Stirling numbers relate the forward differences and the ordinary formula_66 derivatives of a function, formula_67, which is analytic for all formula_68 by the formulas

:formula_69

:formula_70

== Similar properties ==

See the specific articles for details.

==Symmetric formulae==

Abramowitz and Stegun give the following symmetric formulae that relate the Stirling numbers of the first and second kind.

:formula_71

and

:formula_72

==Stirling numbers with negative integral values==
The Stirling numbers can be extended to negative integral values, but not all authors do so in the same way. Regardless of the approach taken, it is worth noting that Stirling numbers of first and second kind are connected by the relations:

: formula_73

when &quot;n&quot; and &quot;k&quot; are nonnegative integers. So we have the following table for formula_74:
Donald Knuth defined the more general Stirling numbers by extending a recurrence relation to all integers. In this approach, formula_75 and formula_76 are zero if &quot;n&quot; is negative and &quot;k&quot; is nonnegative, or if &quot;n&quot; is nonnegative and &quot;k&quot; is negative, and so we have, for &quot;any&quot; integers &quot;n&quot; and &quot;k&quot;,
: formula_77

On the other hand, for positive integers &quot;n&quot; and &quot;k&quot;, David Branson defined formula_78 formula_79 formula_80 and formula_81 (but not formula_82 or formula_83). In this approach, one has the following extension of the recurrence relation of the Stirling numbers of the first kind:

:formula_84,

For example, formula_85 This leads to the following table of values of formula_86 for negative integral &quot;n&quot;.
In this case formula_87 where formula_88 is a Bell number, and so one may define the negative Bell numbers by formula_89.

For example, this produces formula_90, generally formula_91.

<text>Tangaroa (Takaroa in South Island Māori dialect; cognate with Tagaloa in Sāmoan) is the great of the sea, lakes, rivers, and creatures that live within them, especially fish, in Māori mythology. As Tangaroa-whakamau-tai he exercises control over the tides. He is sometimes depicted as a whale.

In some of the Cook Islands he has similar roles, though in Manihiki he is the fire deity that Māui steals from, which in Māori mythology is instead Mahuika, a goddess of fire.

== Māori traditions ==
Tangaroa is son of Ranginui and Papatūānuku, Sky and Earth. After joining his brothers Rongo, Tū, Haumia, and Tāne in the forcible separation of their parents, he is attacked by his brother Tāwhirimātea, the of storms, and forced to hide in the sea.

Tangaroa is the father of many sea creatures. Tangaroa&#x27;s son, Punga, has two children, Ikatere, the ancestor of fish, and Tū-te-wehiwehi (or Tū-te-wanawana), the ancestor of reptiles. Terrified by Tāwhirimātea&#x27;s onslaught, the fish seek shelter in the sea, and the reptiles in the forests. Ever since, Tangaroa has held a grudge with Tāne Mahuta, the of forests, because he offers refuge to his runaway children.
The contention between Tangaroa and Tāne Mahuta, the father of birds, trees, and humans, is an indication that the Māori thought of the ocean and the land as opposed realms. When people go out to sea to fish or to travel, they are in effect representatives of Tāne Mahuta, entering the realm of Tāne Mahuta&#x27;s enemy. For this reason, it was important that offerings were made to Tangaroa before any such expedition.

The Kāi Tahu version of the origin of Takaroa maintains that he is the son of Temoretu, and that Papatūānuku is his wife. Papatūānuku commits adultery with Rakinui while Takaroa is away, and in the resulting battle on the beach Takaroa&#x27;s spear pierces Rakinui through both his thighs. Papatūānuku then marries Rakinui.
In another legend, Tangaroa marries Te Anu-matao (chilling cold). They are the parents of the ‘of the fish class’, including Te Whata-uira-a-Tangawa, Te Whatukura, Poutini, and Te Pounamu. In some versions, Tangaroa has a son, Tinirau, and nine daughters.

== Cook Islands ==
*In Rarotonga, Tangaroa is the god of the sea and fertility. He is the most important of all the departmental gods. Carved figures made from wood carvings are very popular on the island today.
*In Mangaia, Tangaroa is a child of Vatea (daylight) and Papa (foundation) and the younger twin brother of Rongo. Rongo and Tangaroa share food and fish: Tangaroa&#x27;s share is everything that is red (the red taro, red fish and so on). Tangaroa is said to have yellow hair and when Mangaians first saw Europeans they thought they must be Tangaroa&#x27;s children.
*In Manihiki, Tangaroa is the origin of fire. Māui goes to him to obtain fire for humankind. Advised to reach Tangaroa&#x27;s abode by taking the common path, he takes the forbidden path of death infuriating Tangaroa who tries to kick him to death. Māui manages to prevent that and insists that Tangaroa give him fire. Māui kills Tangaroa. When his parents are horrified, Māui uses incantations to bring him back to life.

== Elsewhere ==
Tangaloa is one of the oldest Polynesian deities and in western Polynesia (for example, Samoa and Tonga) traditions has the status of &quot;supreme creator god&quot;. In eastern Polynesian cultures Tangaroa is usually considered of equal status to Tāne and thus not supreme.

*In Rapa Nui tradition Taŋaroa was killed at Hotu-iti bay and was buried in the surrounding area.
*In Ra&#x27;iātea a legend reported by Professor Friedrich Ratzel in 1896 gave a picture of Tahitian god Taaroa&#x27;s all-pervading power.
*In Hawaii the god of ocean, healing, and long travels is called Kanaloa.
*In Sāmoa the god Tagaloa is the almighty sky-father deity, the creator of the universe.
*In the Marquesas Islands, the equivalent deities are Tana&#x27;oa or Taka&#x27;oa.
*In Rennell and Bellona Islands (Polynesian cultures in the southern Solomon Islands) Tangagoa is a sea god who stayed on the coastal cliff of east Rennell known as Toho, and flew in the night with a flame in the sky. Tangagoa was believed to take spirits of the dead, so when someone was near death, the sparkling fire would be seen at night. Some can still recall the time when this god appeared in the night as a flame in the sky, and have many tales of it. Tangagoa started to disappear in the 1970s and early 1980s when Christian missionaries visited the cliff and reportedly &#x27;cast&#x27; him out.

A legendary figure named Tagaro also features in the Melanesian cultures of north-eastern Vanuatu. In the beliefs of North Pentecost island, Tagaro appears as a destructive trickster, while in other areas, he is an eternal creator figure, and names cognate with (such as Apma ) are applied nowadays to the Christian God.

=== Moriori ===
In the mythology of the Moriori of the Chatham Islands, Tangaroa is a fish deity alongside Pou.

<text>Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos (; Latinized as Nicephorus Callistus Xanthopulus; ) was a Greek ecclesiastical historian and litterateur of the late Byzantine Empire. His most popular work, the voluminous &quot;Ecclesiastica historia&quot;, constitutes a significant documentary source on primitive Christianity and its doctrinal controversies, as well as for hagiographical, liturgical, and legendary texts from Byzantine culture. 
== Life ==
Most of our knowledge of Xanthopoulos&#x27; biography comes from the opening of his ecclesiastical history. The preface says that he began working on his history at age thirty-six. Nicephorus was trained in the florid, rhetorical style of Renaissance Byzantine historiography. He became a priest at Hagia Sophia and thus gained access to the patriarchal library. He also gave lessons in rhetoric and theology for which he prepared many new &quot;progymnasmata&quot; (exercises). Xanthopoulos was a friend of Theodoros Metochites, who dedicated his &quot;Poem 12&quot; to him. During his later years it is possible that he became a monk.

== Work ==
=== &quot;Ecclesiastica Historia&quot; ===
Xanthopoulos&#x27; 23-volume &quot;Ecclesiastica&quot; &quot;Historia&quot; (; &quot;Church History&quot;), of which only the first eighteen volumes survive, starts the historical narrative from the time of Christ and continues until the execution of the emperor Phokas in 610. The work includes descriptions of secular events, such as the accession of emperors and military campaigns, but emphasizes ecumenical councils, doctrinal disputes, and the four eastern patriarchates. 

Xanthopoulos begun his project around 1310 using the basilica&#x27;s manuscript library and he completed it sometime after 1317. For the first four centuries, the author is largely dependent on his predecessors, Eusebius, Socrates Scholasticus, Sozomen, Theodoret and Evagrius, his additions showing very little critical faculty. Also relied heavily on a collection of church histories in the Baroccianus Graecus 142, which contains the histories of Sozomen, Evagrios, and a variety of other excerpts on church history. Among the comments and notes that were added by Xanthopoulos, the book contains the phrase &quot;&quot; (&quot;Lord help your slave Nikephoros Kallistos&quot;), which served as both a prayer and a signature. The work was dedicated to the emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus and it contributed to the monarch’s nationalist movement exalting Greek culture and Orthodoxy above Latin Christianity. His later work, which is based upon documents now no longer extant, is much more valuable. 

A table of contents of another five books, continuing the history to the death of Leo VI the Wise in 911, also exists, but whether the books were ever actually written is doubtful. Some modern scholars are of opinion that Nicephorus appropriated and passed off as his own the work of an unknown author of the 10th century. The plan of the work is good and, in spite of its fables and superstitious absurdities, contains important facts which would otherwise have been unknown.

Only one manuscript of the history is known. It was stolen by a Turkish soldier from the library at Buda during the reign of Matthias Corvinus of Hungary and taken to Constantinople, where it was bought by a Christian and eventually reached the imperial library at Vienna.

=== Other ===
Among Xanthopoulos&#x27; other works are commentaries on the writings of the patristic Greek theologian Gregory of Nazianzus and of the Byzantine monk John Climacus. He was also the author of lists of the emperors and patriarchs of Constantinople, of a poem on the capture of Jerusalem, and of a synopsis of the Scriptures, all in iambics; and of commentaries on liturgical poems. As a hagiographer, his writings include a history of miracles that occurred at the shrine of Zoödochos Pege, as well as the lives of Saint Nicholas of Myra and Euphrosyne the Younger. He also wrote many of the synaxaria in use in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

<text>Ta&#x27;aroa is the supreme creator god in the mythology of the Society Islands of French Polynesia. While the use of the ʻeta is appropriate given the pronunciation of his name, it is often omitted in practice, as is typically the case with Tahitian words.

==The Myth==
In the beginning, there was only Ta&#x27;aroa, creator of all, including himself. He waited alone in his shell, which appeared as an egg spinning in the empty endless void of the time before the sky, before the Earth, before the Moon, before the Sun, before the stars. He was bored, alone in his shell, and so he cracked it with a shake of his body and slid out of its confines, finding everything somber and silent outside, finding himself alone in the nothingness.

So he broke the shell into pieces and from them formed the rocks and the sand, and the foundation of all the world, Tumu-Nui. With his backbone he created the mountains; with his tears he filled the oceans, the lakes, the rivers; with his fingernails and toenails he made the scales that cover the fish and the turtles; with his feathers he created the trees and the bushes; with his blood he colored the rainbow.

Ta&#x27;aroa then called forth artists who came with their baskets filled with To&#x27;i, so that they might sculpt Tane, the first god. Then came Ru, Hina, Maui, and hundreds of others. Tane decorated the sky with stars and hung the sun in the sky to illuminate the day and the moon to illuminate the night. Ta&#x27;aroa decided then to complete his work by creating man.

He divided the world into 7 levels. On the bottommost level lived man, and he multiplied quickly, which delighted Ta&#x27;aroa. Sharing the space as he did with creatures and plants of all sorts, it was not long before man felt crowded in his space and so decided to expand his domain by opening a hole into the level above his. Man continued in this fashion, filling one level and then climbing to the next, one level at a time, until all levels were occupied.

And so man filled the Earth, but still all belonged to Ta&#x27;aroa, who was master of all.

<text>Buda (, ) is the part of Budapest, the capital city of Hungary, that lies on the western bank of the Danube. Historically, “Buda” referred only to the royal walled city on Castle Hill (), which was constructed by Béla IV between 1247 and 1249 and subsequently served as the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1361 to 1873. In 1873, Buda was administratively unified with Pest and Óbuda to form modern Budapest. 

Royal Buda is called the &quot;Várnegyed&quot; () today, while “Buda” &quot;pars pro toto&quot; denotes Budapest’s I., II., III., XI., XII. and XXII. districts. This colloquial definition thus includes medieval Óbuda and amounts to a third of the city’s total area, much of it forested. Buda&#x27;s landmarks include the Royal Palace, Matthias Church, the Citadella, Gellért Baths, the Buda Hills, the Carmelite Monastery of Buda, and the residence of the President of Hungary, Sándor Palace.

== Etymology ==
According to a legend recorded in chronicles from the Middle Ages, the name &quot;Buda&quot; comes from the name of Bleda (), brother of Hunnic ruler Attila.

== Demographics ==

The Buda fortress and palace were built by King Béla IV of Hungary in 1247, and were the nucleus around which the town of Buda was built, which soon gained great importance, and became in 1361 the capital of Hungary.

While Pest was mostly Hungarian in the 15th century, Buda had a German majority; however according to the Hungarian Royal Treasury, it had a Hungarian majority with a sizeable German minority in 1495. In 1432, Bertrandon de la Broquière wrote that Buda &quot;is governed by Germans, as well in respect to police as commerce, and what regards the different professions&quot;. He noted a significant Jewish population in the city, proficient in French, many of whom were descendants of Jews previously expelled from France.

Buda became part of Ottoman-ruled central Hungary from 1541 to 1686. It was the capital of the province of Budin during the Ottoman era. By the middle of the seventeenth century Buda had become majority Muslim, largely resulting from an influx of Balkan Muslims.

In 1686, two years after the unsuccessful siege of Buda, a renewed European campaign was started to enter Buda, which was formerly the capital of medieval Hungary. This time, the Holy League&#x27;s army was twice as large, containing over 74,000 men, including German, Dutch, Hungarian, English, Spanish, Czech, French, Croat, Burgundian, Danish and Swedish soldiers, along with other Europeans as volunteers, artillerymen, and officers, the Christian forces reconquered Buda (see Siege of Buda).

After the reconquest of Buda, bourgeoisie from different parts of southern Germany moved into the almost deserted city. Germans — also clinging to their language — partly crowded out, partly assimilated the Hungarians and Serbians they had found here. As the rural population moved into Buda, in the 19th century Hungarians slowly became the majority there.

<doc id="95475" wikidata="Q2006270" url="?curid=95475" title="Tāwhirimātea">
<text>In Māori mythology, Tāwhirimātea (or Tāwhiri) is the god of weather, including thunder and lightning, wind, clouds and storms. He is a son of Papatūānuku (earth mother) and Ranginui (sky father). Tawhirimatea is the second oldest of 7 children, all of whom are boys. In his anger at his brothers for separating their parents, Tāwhirimātea destroyed the forests of Tāne (god of forests), drove Tangaroa (god of the sea) and his progeny into the sea, pursued Rongo and Haumia-tiketike till they had to take refuge in the bosom of their mother Papa, and only found in Tūmatauenga a worthy opponent and eternal enemy (Tregear 1891:499). To fight his brothers, Tāwhirimātea gathered an army of his children, winds and clouds of different kinds – including Apū-hau (&quot;fierce squall&quot;), Apū-matangi, Ao-nui, Ao-roa, Ao-pōuri, Ao-pōtango, Ao-whētuma, Ao-whekere, Ao-kāhiwahiwa, Ao-kānapanapa, Ao-pākinakina, Ao-pakarea, and Ao-tākawe (Grey 1971). Grey translates these as &#x27;fierce squalls, whirlwinds, dense clouds, massy clouds, dark clouds, gloomy thick clouds, fiery clouds, clouds which preceded hurricanes, clouds of fiery black, clouds reflecting glowing red light, clouds wildly drifting from all quarters and wildly bursting, clouds of thunder storms, and clouds hurriedly flying on&#x27; (Grey 1956:5). 

Other children of Tāwhirimātea are the various kinds of rain, mists and fog. Tāwhirimātea&#x27;s attacks on his brothers led to the flooding of large areas of the land. The names of the beings involved in this flooding include Ua-nui (terrible rain), Ua-roa (long-continued rain), Ua-whatu (fierce hailstorms), and Ua-nganga (sleet); after these, their children in turn took up the fight: Hau-maringi (mist), Hau-marotoroto (heavy dew), and Tōmairangi (light mist) (Grey 1956:10–11, Grey 1971:5). Tregear mentions Hau-maringiringi as a personification of mists (Tregear 1891:54).

Tāwhirimātea lives on the sky with his father Rangi and brother, the star Rehua.

==The Divine War and Tāwhirimātea&#x27;s conquest over his brothers==
Eons ago, Rangi, the Sky Father, and Papa, the Earth Mother, were in an eternal embrace because of their love for each other. Their union gave rise to many powerful sons, who lived in between their parents.

As their sons grew up, they soon began to grow tired of living in a cramped up space, forever in darkness. One brother, Tūmatūenga, the God of War and Humans, suggested that they slay their parents. However, his brother, Tāne, the God of Forests, suggested that they separate their parents forever.

Except for Tāwhirimātea, all other brothers accepted the proposal. The brothers individually tried to separate their parents, but Tāne put his head on the earth and feet in the sky and pushed them apart.

Tāwhirimātea was enraged, as he saw it as a move to usurp his kingdom. So the god flew to the sky and communed with his father. Rangi reluctantly agreed to help his son wage a brutal war on his siblings. They were the spirits of winds, storms, and rain. Tāwhirimātea assembled his huge army and set out to conquer his brothers.

Tāwhirimātea first attacked Tāne, and razed his forests, causing Tāne to flee. Next, Tāwhirimātea attacked his brother, Tangaroa, the Sea God. He caused huge storms and waves, spreading panic in Tangaroa. Tangaroa was himself helpless before Tāwhirimātea, as the sea was in such a chaotic rage, harming all living beings. Having never seen such chaos at sea, many of Tangaroa&#x27;s children deserted their father and took shelter with Tāne. Since then Tangaroa is at war with Tāne.

Tāwhirimātea pursued his brother, Rongo, and Haumea, the gods of cultivated and uncultivated food, but they were cleverly hidden by their mother, Papa, who still loved her children. Finally, Tāwhirimātea began to fight Tumatuenga.

This time, however, Tumatuenga firmly embedded his feet in the earth, saving him from Tāwhirimātea&#x27;s storms. He cast spells, which turned the storms into gentle weather, suitable for humans. But neither brother could prevail against each other. Tāwhirimātea slowly withdrew.

To punish his brothers for cowardice, Tumatuenga invented the arts of hunting, woodcutting, agriculture, cooking, and fishing, to subjugate their respective denizens as food for humans. However, Tumatuenga and Tawhirimatea still fight each other to this day. Another result of the war was that most of the land was submerged into the ocean, because of Tāwhirimātea causing heavy rains and thunderstorms. He was maybe the only brother out of all of them to want their parents together.

<text>Upton Beall Sinclair Jr. (September 20, 1878 – November 25, 1968) was an American author, muckraker, and political activist, and the 1934 Democratic Party nominee for governor of California. He wrote nearly 100 books and other works in several genres. Sinclair&#x27;s work was well known and popular in the first half of the 20th century, and he won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1943.

In 1906, Sinclair acquired particular fame for his muckraking novel, &quot;The Jungle&quot;, which exposed labor and sanitary conditions in the U.S. meatpacking industry, causing a public uproar that contributed in part to the passage a few months later of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act. In 1919, he published &quot;The Brass Check&quot;, a muckraking exposé of American journalism that publicized the issue of yellow journalism and the limitations of the &quot;free press&quot; in the United States. Four years after publication of &quot;The Brass Check&quot;, the first code of ethics for journalists was created. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called him &quot;a man with every gift except humor and silence&quot;. He is also well remembered for the quote: &quot;It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.&quot; He used this line in speeches and the book about his campaign for governor as a way to explain why the editors and publishers of the major newspapers in California would not treat seriously his proposals for old age pensions and other progressive reforms. Many of his novels can be read as historical works. Writing during the Progressive Era, Sinclair describes the world of the industrialized United States from both the working man&#x27;s and the industrialist&#x27;s points of view. Novels such as &quot;King Coal&quot; (1917), &quot;The Coal War&quot; (published posthumously), &quot;Oil!&quot; (1927), and &quot;The Flivver King&quot; (1937) describe the working conditions of the coal, oil, and auto industries at the time.

&quot;The Flivver King&quot; describes the rise of Henry Ford, his &quot;wage reform&quot; and his company&#x27;s Sociological Department, to his decline into antisemitism as publisher of &quot;The Dearborn Independent&quot;. &quot;King Coal&quot; confronts John D. Rockefeller Jr., and his role in the 1914 Ludlow Massacre in the coal fields of Colorado.

Sinclair was an outspoken socialist and ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a nominee from the Socialist Party. He was also the Democratic Party candidate for governor of California during the Great Depression, running under the banner of the End Poverty in California campaign, but was defeated in the 1934 election.

==Early life and education==
Sinclair was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Upton Beall Sinclair Sr. and Priscilla Harden Sinclair. His father was a liquor salesman whose alcoholism shadowed his son&#x27;s childhood. Priscilla Harden Sinclair was a strict Episcopalian who disliked alcohol, tea, and coffee. Both of Upton Sinclair&#x27;s parents were of British ancestry. His paternal grandparents were Scottish, and all of his ancestors emigrated to America from Great Britain during the late 1600s and early 1700s. As a child, Sinclair slept either on sofas or cross-ways on his parents&#x27; bed. When his father was out for the night, he would sleep in the bed with his mother. His mother&#x27;s family was very affluent: her parents were very prosperous in Baltimore, and her sister married a millionaire. Sinclair had wealthy maternal grandparents with whom he often stayed. This gave him insight into how both the rich and the poor lived during the late 19th century. Living in two social settings affected him and greatly influenced his books. Upton Beall Sinclair Sr. was from a highly respected family in the South, but the family was financially ruined by the Civil War, the end of slavery causing disruptions of the labor system during the Reconstruction era, and an extended agricultural depression.

As he was growing up, Upton&#x27;s family moved frequently, as his father was not successful in his career. He developed a love for reading when he was five years old. He read every book his mother owned for a deeper understanding of the world. He did not start school until he was 10 years old. He was deficient in math and worked hard to catch up quickly because of his embarrassment. In 1888, the Sinclair family moved to Queens, New York City, where his father sold shoes. Upton entered the City College of New York five days before his 14th birthday, on September 15, 1892. He wrote jokes, dime novels, and magazine articles in boys&#x27; weekly and pulp magazines to pay for his tuition. With that income, he was able to move his parents to an apartment when he was seventeen years old.

He graduated from City College in June 1897. He subsequently studied law at Columbia University, but he was more interested in writing. He learned several languages, including Spanish, German, and French. He paid the one-time enrollment fee to be able to learn a variety of subjects. He would sign up for a class and then later drop it. He again supported himself through college by writing boys&#x27; adventure stories and jokes. He also sold ideas to cartoonists. Using stenographers, he wrote up to 8,000 words of pulp fiction per day. His only complaint about his educational experience was that it failed to educate him about socialism. After leaving Columbia without a degree, he wrote four books in the next four years; they were commercially unsuccessful though critically well-received: &quot;King Midas&quot; (1901), &quot;Prince Hagen&quot; (1902), &quot;The Journal of Arthur Stirling&quot; (1903), and a Civil War novel, &quot;Manassas&quot; (1904).

Sinclair did not get on with his mother when he became older because of her strict rules and refusal to allow him independence. Sinclair later told his son, David, that around Sinclair&#x27;s 16th year, he decided not to have anything to do with his mother, staying away from her for 35 years because an argument would start if they met.

Upton became close with Reverend William Wilmerding Moir. Moir specialized in sexual abstinence and taught his beliefs to Sinclair. He was taught to &quot;avoid the subject of sex.&quot; Sinclair was to report to Moir monthly regarding his abstinence. Despite their close relationship, Sinclair identified as agnostic.

==Career==

Sinclair considered himself a poet and dedicated his time to writing poetry. In 1904, Sinclair spent seven weeks in disguise, working undercover in Chicago&#x27;s meatpacking plants to research his novel &quot;The Jungle&quot; (1906), a political exposé that addressed conditions in the plants, as well as the lives of poor immigrants. When it was published two years later, it became a bestseller. In the spring of 1905, Sinclair issued a call for the formation of a new organization, a group to be called the Intercollegiate Socialist Society.
With the income from &quot;The Jungle&quot;, Sinclair founded the utopian—but non-Jewish white only—Helicon Home Colony in Englewood, New Jersey. He ran as a Socialist candidate for Congress. The colony burned down under suspicious circumstances within a year.

In 1913–1914, Sinclair made three trips to the coal fields of Colorado, which led him to write &quot;King Coal&quot; and caused him to begin work on the larger, more historical &quot;The Coal War.&quot; In 1914, Sinclair helped organize demonstrations in New York City against Rockefeller at the Standard Oil offices. The demonstrations touched off more actions by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and the &quot;Mother Earth&quot; group, a loose association of anarchists and IWW members, in Rockefeller&#x27;s hometown of Tarrytown.

The Sinclairs moved to Pasadena, California in 1916 and lived there for nearly four decades. During his years with his second wife, Mary Craig, Sinclair wrote or produced several films. Recruited by Charlie Chaplin, Sinclair and Mary Craig produced Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;¡Qué viva México!&quot; in 1930–32.

==Other interests==
Aside from his political and social writings, Sinclair took an interest in occult phenomena and experimented with telepathy. His book &quot;Mental Radio&quot; (1930) included accounts of his wife Mary&#x27;s telepathic experiences and ability. William McDougall read the book and wrote an introduction to it, which led him to establish the parapsychology department at Duke University.

==Political career==
Sinclair broke with the Socialist Party in 1917 and supported the First World War effort. By the 1920s, however, he had returned to the party.

In the 1920s, the Sinclairs moved to Monrovia, California, (near Los Angeles), where Sinclair founded the state&#x27;s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. Wanting to pursue politics, he twice ran unsuccessfully for the United States Congress on the Socialist Party ticket: in 1920 for the House of Representatives and in 1922 for the Senate. He was the party candidate for governor of California in 1926, winning nearly 46,000 votes, and in 1930, winning nearly 50,000 votes.

During this period, Sinclair was also active in radical politics in Los Angeles. For instance, in 1923, to support the challenged free speech rights of Industrial Workers of the World, Sinclair spoke at a rally during the San Pedro Maritime Strike, in a neighborhood now known as Liberty Hill. He began to read from the Bill of Rights and was promptly arrested, along with hundreds of others, by the LAPD. The arresting officer proclaimed: &quot;We&#x27;ll have none of that Constitution stuff&quot;. In the same year, Sinclair founded the Southern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. 

In 1934, Sinclair ran in the California gubernatorial election as a Democrat. Sinclair&#x27;s platform, known as the End Poverty in California movement (EPIC), galvanized the support of the Democratic Party, and Sinclair gained its nomination. Gaining 879,000 votes made this his most successful run for office, but incumbent Governor Frank Merriam defeated him by a sizable margin, gaining 1,138,000 votes. Hollywood studio bosses unanimously opposed Sinclair. They pressured their employees to assist and vote for Merriam&#x27;s campaign, and made false propaganda films attacking Sinclair, giving him no opportunity to respond. The negative campaign tactics used against Sinclair are briefly depicted in the 2020 American biographical drama film &quot;Mank&quot;. Upton Sinclair later stated that there was a &quot;campaign of lying&quot; against him during the campaign which was &quot;ordered by the biggest businessmen in California and paid for with millions of dollars&quot; that was carried out by newspapers, politicians, advertisers, and the film industry.

Sinclair&#x27;s plan to end poverty quickly became a controversial issue under the pressure of numerous migrants to California fleeing the Dust Bowl. Conservatives considered his proposal an attempted communist takeover of their state and quickly opposed him, using propaganda to portray Sinclair as a staunch communist. Sinclair had been a member of the Socialist Party from 1902 to 1934, when he became a Democrat, though always considering himself a socialist in spirit. The Socialist party in California and nationwide refused to allow its members to be active in any other party including the Democratic Party and expelled him, along with socialists who supported his California campaign. The expulsions destroyed the Socialist party in California.

At the same time, American and Soviet communists disassociated themselves from him, considering him a capitalist. In later writings, such as his anti-alcohol book &quot;The Cup of Fury&quot;, Sinclair scathingly censured communism. Science-fiction author Robert A. Heinlein was deeply involved in Sinclair&#x27;s campaign, although he attempted to move away from the stance later in his life. In the 21st century, Sinclair is considered an early American democratic socialist.

After his loss to Merriam, Sinclair abandoned EPIC and politics to return to writing. In 1935, he published &quot;I, Candidate for Governor: And How I Got Licked&quot;, in which he described the techniques employed by Merriam&#x27;s supporters, including the then popular Aimee Semple McPherson, who vehemently opposed socialism and what she perceived as Sinclair&#x27;s modernism. Sinclair&#x27;s line from this book &quot;It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it&quot; has become well known and was for example quoted by Al Gore in &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;.

Of his gubernatorial bid, Sinclair remarked in 1951:

The American People will take Socialism, but they won&#x27;t take the label. I certainly proved it in the case of EPIC. Running on the Socialist ticket I got 60,000 votes, and running on the slogan to &#x27;End Poverty in California&#x27; I got 879,000. I think we simply have to recognize the fact that our enemies have succeeded in spreading the Big Lie. There is no use attacking it by a front attack, it is much better to out-flank them.

==Personal life==

In April 1900, Sinclair went to Lake Massawippi in Quebec to work on a novel, renting a small cabin for three months and then moving to a farmhouse where he was reintroduced to his future first wife, Meta Fuller (1880–1964). A childhood friend descended from one of the First Families of Virginia, she was three years younger than he and aspired to be more than a housewife, so Sinclair instructed her in what to read and learn. Though each had warned the other against it, on October 18, 1900, they married. The couple having used abstinence as their main form of contraception, Meta became pregnant the following year. Despite Meta&#x27;s several attempts to terminate the pregnancy, the child, David, was born on December 1, 1901. Meta and her family tried to convince Sinclair to give up writing and get &quot;a job that would support his family.&quot;

Sinclair was opposed to sex outside of marriage and viewed it as necessary only for reproduction. He told his first wife Meta that only the birth of a child gave marriage &quot;dignity and meaning&quot;. Despite his beliefs, Sinclair had a love affair with Anna Noyes during his marriage to Meta. He wrote a novel about the affair called &quot;Love&#x27;s Progress&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Love&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;. It was never published. His wife later had a love affair with John Armistead Collier, a theology student from Memphis; they had a son together named Ben.

In 1910, the Sinclairs moved to the single-tax village of Arden, Delaware, where they built a house. In 1911, Sinclair was arrested for playing tennis on the Sabbath and spent eighteen hours in the New Castle County prison in lieu of paying a fine. Earlier in 1911, Sinclair invited Harry Kemp, the &quot;Vagabond Poet&quot;, to camp on the couple&#x27;s land in Arden. Meta soon became enamored of Kemp, and in late August she left Sinclair for the poet. Sinclair, unable to obtain a divorce in New York, traveled to the Netherlands for a migratory divorce.
An Amsterdam court declared their marriage annulled May 24, 1912 on the basis of adultery by Meta. Sinclair declared before the court that they were both living in Hilversum, The Netherlands, Meta being temporarily in New York.

In 1913, Sinclair married Mary Craig Kimbrough (1882–1961), a woman from an elite Greenwood, Mississippi, family who had written articles on Winnie Davis, the daughter of Confederate States of America President Jefferson Davis. They met when she attended one of his lectures about &quot;The Jungle&quot;. In 1914 he moved to Croton-on-Hudson, New York, joining the local community of prominent socialists.
In the 1920s, the couple moved to Long Beach, California. They remained married until her death in 1961.

Later that same year, Sinclair married his third wife, Mary Elizabeth Willis (1882–1967). They moved to Buckeye, Arizona, before returning east to Bound Brook, New Jersey, where Sinclair died in a nursing home on November 25, 1968, a year after his wife. He is buried next to Willis in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

==Writing==
Sinclair devoted his writing career to documenting and criticizing the social and economic conditions of the early 20th century in both fiction and nonfiction. He exposed his view of the injustices of capitalism and the overwhelming effects of poverty among the working class. He also edited collections of fiction and nonfiction.

===&quot;The Jungle&quot;===

His novel based on the meatpacking industry in Chicago, &quot;The Jungle,&quot; was first published in serial form in the socialist newspaper &quot;Appeal to Reason,&quot; from February 25, 1905, to November 4, 1905. It was published as a book by Doubleday in 1906.

Sinclair had spent about six months investigating the Chicago meatpacking industry for &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;, the work which inspired his novel. He intended to &quot;set forth the breaking of human hearts by a system which exploits the labor of men and women for profit&quot;. The novel featured Jurgis Rudkus, a Lithuanian immigrant who works in a meat factory in Chicago, his teenage wife Ona Lukoszaite, and their extended family. Sinclair portrays their mistreatment by Rudkus&#x27; employers and the wealthier elements of society. His descriptions of the unsanitary and inhumane conditions that workers suffered served to shock and galvanize readers. Jack London called Sinclair&#x27;s book &quot;the &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; of wage slavery&quot;. Domestic and foreign purchases of American meat fell by half.

Sinclair wrote in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; in October 1906 about &quot;The Jungle&quot;: &quot;I aimed at the public&#x27;s heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach.&quot; The novel brought public lobbying for Congressional legislation and government regulation of the industry, including passage of the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act. At the time, President Theodore Roosevelt characterized Sinclair as a &quot;crackpot&quot;, writing to William Allen White, &quot;I have an utter contempt for him. He is hysterical, unbalanced, and untruthful. Three-fourths of the things he said were absolute falsehoods. For some of the remainder there was only a basis of truth.&quot; After reading &quot;The Jungle,&quot; Roosevelt agreed with some of Sinclair&#x27;s conclusions, but was opposed to legislation that he considered &quot;socialist.&quot; He said, &quot;Radical action must be taken to do away with the efforts of arrogant and selfish greed on the part of the capitalist.&quot;

Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s play, &quot;Saint Joan of the Stockyards&quot;, transporting Joan of Arc to the environment of the Chicago stockyards, is clearly inspired by &quot;The Jungle&quot;.

===&quot;The Brass Check&quot;===
In &quot;The Brass Check&quot; (1919), Sinclair made a systematic and incriminating critique of the severe limitations of the &quot;free press&quot; in the United States. Among the topics covered is the use of yellow journalism techniques created by William Randolph Hearst. Sinclair called &quot;The Brass Check&quot; &quot;the most important and most dangerous book I have ever written.&quot;

According to &quot;The Brass Check&quot;, &quot;American Journalism is a class institution, serving the rich and spurning the poor.&quot; This bias, Sinclair felt, had profound implications for American democracy:

The social body to which we belong is at this moment passing through one of the greatest crises of its history ... What if the nerves upon which we depend for knowledge of this social body should give us false reports of its condition?

===&quot;Sylvia&quot; novels===
* &quot;Sylvia&quot; (1913) was a novel about a Southern girl. In her autobiography, Mary Craig Sinclair said she had written the book based on her own experiences as a girl, and Upton collaborated with her. According to Craig, at her insistence, Sinclair published &quot;Sylvia&quot; (1913) under his name. In her 1957 memoir, she described how her husband and she had collaborated on the work: &quot;Upton and I struggled through several chapters of &quot;Sylvia&quot; together, disagreeing about something on every page. But now and then each of us admitted that the other had improved something.&quot; When it appeared in 1913, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;the best novel Mr. Sinclair has yet written–so much the best that it stands in a class by itself.&quot;
* &quot;Sylvia&#x27;s Marriage&quot; (1914), Craig and Sinclair collaborated on a sequel, also published by John C. Winston Company under Upton Sinclair&#x27;s name. In his 1962 autobiography, Upton Sinclair wrote: &quot;[Mary] Craig had written some tales of her Southern girlhood; and I had stolen them from her for a novel to be called &quot;Sylvia&quot;.&quot;

===&quot;I, Governor of California, and How I Ended Poverty&quot;===
This was a pamphlet he published in 1934 as a preface to running for office in the state of California. In the book he outlined his plans to run as a Democrat instead of a Socialist, and imagines his climb to the Democratic nomination, and then subsequent victory by a margin of 100,000 votes.

===Lanny Budd series===
Between 1940 and 1953, Sinclair wrote a series of 11 novels featuring a central character named Lanny Budd. The son of an American arms manufacturer, Budd is portrayed as holding in the confidence of world leaders, and not simply witnessing events, but often propelling them. As a sophisticated socialite who mingles easily with people from all cultures and socioeconomic classes, Budd has been characterized as the antithesis of the stereotyped &quot;Ugly American&quot;.

Sinclair placed Budd within the important political events in the United States and Europe in the first half of the 20th century. An actual company named the Budd Company manufactured arms during World War II, founded by Edward G. Budd in 1912.

The novels were bestsellers upon publication and were published in translation, appearing in 21 countries. The third book in the series, &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Teeth&quot; (1942), won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1943. Out of print and nearly forgotten for years, ebook editions of the Lanny Budd series were published in 2016.

The Lanny Budd series includes:
* &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot;, 1940
* &quot;Between Two Worlds&quot;, 1941
* &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Teeth&quot;, 1942
* &quot;Wide is the Gate&quot;, 1943
* &quot;Presidential Agent&quot;, 1944
* &quot;Dragon Harvest&quot;, 1945
* &quot;A World to Win&quot;, 1946
* &quot;Presidential Mission&quot;, 1947
* &quot;One Clear Call&quot;, 1948
* &quot;O Shepherd, Speak!&quot;, 1949
* &quot;The Return of Lanny Budd&quot;, 1953
===Other works===
Sinclair was keenly interested in health and nutrition. He experimented with various diets, and with fasting. He wrote about this in his book, &quot;The Fasting Cure&quot; (1911), another bestseller. He believed that periodic fasting was important for health, saying, &quot;I had taken several fasts of ten or twelve days&#x27; duration, with the result of a complete making over of my health&quot;.

Sinclair favored a raw food diet of predominantly vegetables and nuts. For long periods of time, he was a complete vegetarian, but he also experimented with eating meat. His attitude to these matters was fully explained in the chapter, &quot;The Use of Meat&quot;, in the above-mentioned book. In the last years of his life, Sinclair strictly ate three meals a day consisting only of brown rice, fresh fruit and celery, topped with powdered milk and salt, and pineapple juice to drink.

==Representation in popular culture==

* Sinclair Lewis refers to Upton Sinclair and his EPIC plan in the novel &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; (1935).
* Sinclair appears in T. C. Boyle&#x27;s novel &quot;The Road to Wellville&quot; (1993), which is built around a historical fictionalization of John Harvey Kellogg, the inventor of corn flakes and the founder of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. In the book, Sinclair and his first wife, Meta, appear as patients at the Sanitarium. Later, Kellogg is outraged when he discovers that another of his patients has been fasting after reading a typescript of Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;The Fasting Cure&quot;.
* Sinclair appears in the American Empire trilogy (2001–2003), part of the wider Southern Victory series of alternate history novels by Harry Turtledove. In the series, Sinclair becomes president of the United States, serving from 1921 to 1929, as the first president from the Socialist Party. During his administration, he builds up social welfare programs at home and tries to foster peace abroad. Sinclair takes a more lenient stance towards the Confederacy than his predecessor Theodore Roosevelt did, cancelling Great War reparations following the assassination of Confederate President Wade Hampton V in 1922.
* Sinclair is featured as one of the main characters in Chris Bachelder&#x27;s satirical novel, &quot;U.S.!&quot; (2005). Repeatedly, Sinclair is resurrected after his death and assassinated again, a &quot;personification of the contemporary failings of the American left&quot;. He is portrayed as a quixotic reformer attempting to stir an apathetic American public to implement socialism in America.
* Joyce Carol Oates refers to Sinclair and his first wife, Meta, in her novel &quot;The Accursed&quot; (2013).
* Sinclair was portrayed by Bill Nye in David Fincher&#x27;s biopic &quot;Mank&quot; (2020).

==Films==
* &quot;The Jungle&quot; (1914) is a silent film adaptation of the 1906 novel, with George Nash playing Jurgis Rudkus and Gail Kane playing Ona Lukozsaite. The film is considered lost. Sinclair appears at the beginning and end of the film as a form of endorsement.
* &quot;The Wet Parade&quot; (1932) is a film adaptation of Sinclair&#x27;s eponymous 1931 novel, directed by Victor Fleming and starring Lewis Stone, Walter Huston, Dorothy Jordan, Neil Hamilton, Robert Young, and Jimmy Durante. Myrna Loy appears very briefly as an actress who runs an elegant speakeasy.
* Walt Disney Productions adapted &quot;The Gnomobile&quot; (1937) into the 1967 musical motion picture &quot;The Gnome-Mobile&quot;.
* &quot;Oil!&quot; (1927) was adapted as the film &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; (2007), starring Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano, and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. The film received eight Oscar nominations and won two.
* In David Fincher&#x27;s film drama &quot;Mank&quot; (2020), Bill Nye has a small role as Sinclair running for California governor in 1934 as the Democratic nominee.

<doc id="95478" wikidata="Q184943" url="?curid=95478" title="Grammatical particle">
<text>In grammar, the term particle (abbreviated ) has a traditional meaning, as a part of speech that cannot be inflected, and a modern meaning, as a function word (functor) associated with another word or phrase in order to impart meaning. Although a particle may have an intrinsic meaning and may fit into other grammatical categories, the fundamental idea of the particle is to add context to the sentence, expressing a mood or indicating a specific action. 

In English, for example, the phrase &quot;oh well&quot; has no purpose in speech other than to convey a mood. The word &quot;up&quot; would be a particle in the phrase &quot;look up&quot; (as in &quot;look up this topic&quot;), implying that one researches something rather than that one literally gazes skywards. Many languages use particles in varying amounts and for varying reasons. In Hindi, they may be used as honorifics, or to indicate emphasis or negation. In some languages, they are clearly defined; for example, in Chinese, there are three types of (; ): &quot;structural&quot;, &quot;aspectual&quot;, and &quot;modal&quot;. &quot;Structural&quot; particles are used for grammatical relations. &quot;Aspectual&quot; particles signal grammatical aspects. &quot;Modal&quot; particles express linguistic modality. However, Polynesian languages, which are almost devoid of inflection, use particles extensively to indicate mood, tense, and case.

== Modern meaning ==
In modern grammar, a particle is a function word that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning, i.e., it does not have its own lexical definition. According to this definition, particles are a separate part of speech and are distinct from other classes of function words, such as articles, prepositions, conjunctions and adverbs. Languages vary widely in how much they use particles, some using them extensively and others more commonly using alternative devices such as prefixes/suffixes, inflection, auxiliary verbs and word order. Particles are typically words that encode grammatical categories (such as negation, mood, tense, or case), clitics, fillers or (oral) discourse markers such as &quot;well&quot;, &quot;um&quot;, etc. Particles are never inflected.

== Afrikaans ==
Some commonly used particles in Afrikaans include:
* 2: Afrikaans has a double negation system, as in:

:: The first 1 is analysed as an adverb, while the second 2 as a negation particle.
* : Infinitive verbs are preceded by the complementiser and the infinitival particle , e.g.

* or : Both and are genitive particles, e.g.
* and : These two particles are found in constructions like
== Arabic ==
Particles in Arabic can take the form of a single root letter before a given word, like &quot; (&#x27;and&#x27;), &quot; (&#x27;so&#x27;) and &quot; (&#x27;to&#x27;). However, other particles like &quot; (which marks a question) can be complete words as well.

== Chinese ==

There are three types of (; particles) in Chinese: Structural, Aspectual, and Modal. Structural particles are used for grammatical relations. Aspectual particles signal grammatical aspects. Modal particles express linguistic modality. Note that particles are different from (; modal verbs) in Chinese.

== English ==
&quot;Particle&quot; is a somewhat nebulous term for a variety of small words that do not conveniently fit into other classes of words. &quot;The Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language&quot; defines a particle as a &quot;word that does not change its form through inflection and does not fit easily into the established system of parts of speech&quot;. The term includes the &quot;adverbial particles&quot; like &quot;up&quot; or &quot;out&quot; in verbal idioms (phrasal verbs) such as &quot;look up&quot; or &quot;knock out&quot;; it also includes the &quot;infinitival particle&quot; &quot;to&quot;, the &quot;negative particle&quot; &quot;not&quot;, the &quot;imperative particles&quot; &quot;do&quot; and &quot;let&quot;, and sometimes &quot;pragmatic particles&quot; (also called &quot;fillers&quot; or &quot;discourse markers&quot;) like &quot;oh&quot; and &quot;well&quot;. 

== German ==
A German modal particle serves no necessary syntactical function, but expresses the speaker&#x27;s attitude towards the utterance. Modal particles include and others. Some of these also appear in non-particle forms. , for example, is also the conjunction &quot;but&quot;. In , &quot;He is American, but he speaks German well,&quot; is a conjunction connecting two sentences. But in , the is a particle, with the sentence perhaps best translated as &quot;What good German he speaks!&quot; These particles are common in speech but rarely found in written language, except that which has a spoken quality (such as online messaging).

== Hindi ==
There are different types of particles present in Hindi: emphatic particles, limiter particles, negation particles, affirmative particles, honorific particles, topic-marker particle and case-marking particles. Some common particles of Hindi are mentioned in the table below:
== Japanese and Korean ==

The term &quot;particle&quot; is often used in descriptions of Japanese and Korean, where they are used to mark nouns according to their grammatical case or thematic relation in a sentence or clause. Linguistic analyses describe them as suffixes, clitics, or postpositions. There are sentence-tagging particles such as Japanese question markers.

== Polynesian languages ==
Polynesian languages are almost devoid of inflection, and use particles extensively to indicate mood, tense, and case. Suggs, discussing the deciphering of the rongorongo script of Easter Island, describes them as all-important. In Māori for example, the versatile particle can signal the imperative mood, the vocative case, the future tense, or the subject of a sentence formed with most passive verbs. The particle signals the past imperfect tense, the object of a transitive verb or the subject of a sentence formed with &quot;neuter verbs&quot; (a form of passive verb), as well as the prepositions &quot;in&quot;, &quot;at&quot; and &quot;from&quot;.

=== Tokelauan ===
In Tokelauan, is used when describing personal names, month names, and nouns used to describe a collaborative group of people participating in something together. It also can be used when a verb does not directly precede a pronoun to describe said pronouns. Its use for pronouns is optional but mostly in this way. cannot be used if the noun it is describing follows any of the prepositions , or . A couple of the other ways unrelated to what is listed above that is used is when preceding a locative or place name. However, if is being used in this fashion, the locative or place name must be the subject of the sentence. Another particle in Tokelauan is , or sometimes . This article is used before a person&#x27;s name as well as the names of months and the particle is used before pronouns when these instances are following the prepositions or . is a particle used if following the preposition .

== Russian ==
In Russian, particles sometimes play an important role making an additional nuance for a meaning of a phrase or of a whole sentence. One example is the particle , which imparts conditional mood (subjunctive) to a verb it is applied to or to a whole sentence. Other examples are and which are usually used to emphasise or accent other words. Generally there are lots of different particles in Russian of many kinds. Some of them are complex, consisting of other particles, others are as simple as one letter ().

== Turkish ==
In some sources, exclamations and conjunctions are also considered Turkish particles. In this article, exclamations and conjunctions will not be dealt with, but only Turkish particles. The main particles used in Turkish are:
* , another
* , since
* , one
* , only
* , regarding
* , right
* , not
* , mention
* , as much
* , until

* , due
* , so
* , before
* , informal
* , like
* , by
* , for
* , with
* , until
* , against
* , although or despite

* , corresponding
* , prior to
* , due to
* , beyond
* , despite
* , only
* , as if
* , then
* , row
* , to
* , alone
Particles can be used with the simple form of the names to which they are attached or in other cases. Some of particles uses with attached form, and some particles are always used after the relevant form. For examples, , , , :

* ( is nominative)
* (dative)
* (ablative)

Turkish particles according to their functions. used for &#x27;other, another, otherwise, new, diverse, either&#x27;.
* 

 used for &#x27;by, in comparison, about, despite&#x27;.
* 

 used for &#x27;for, with, because, because of, how&#x27;.

<doc id="95481" wikidata="Q1507592" url="?curid=95481" title="Tūmatauenga">
<text>Tūmatauenga (&quot;Tū of the angry face&quot;) is the primary god () of war and human activities such as hunting, food cultivation, fishing, and cooking in Māori mythology.

In creation stories, Tū suggests to kill his parents to allow light into the world. After they are instead separated. One of his brothers Tāwhirimātea was not happy with this and had declared war against his brothers and Tū was the only one who fought while the other brothers hid away avoiding the fight. Because of his brothers actions and having to fight Tāwhiri alone, he wars with his brothers and becomes the origin of humanity&#x27;s activities, and the reasons for their behaviour when interacting with the creations of his brothers.

As the god of war, all were dedicated to him and he was treated with the greatest respect and awe. Tūmatauenga inspires the New Zealand Army&#x27;s Māori name: where all soldiers are deemed of the same &quot;iwi&quot; (&quot;tribe&quot;) under the deity&#x27;s patronage regardless of racial heritage. The marae is often considered the – fiery ovens of Tūmatauenga – the realm of Tūmatauenga, whereas all areas where battles take place become – the battle domain of Tūmatauenga.

== Names and epithets ==
After his victories over his brothers, Tū assumed many names; one name for each of the characteristics he displayed in his victories over his brothers, including:
*Tū-kā-riri (Tū the angry)
*Tū-ka-nguha (Tū the fierce fighter)
*Tū-kai-tangata (Tū who destroys humankind)
*Tū-kai-taua (Tū the destroyer of armies)
*Tū-mata-whāiti (Tū the cunning)
*Tū-mata-uenga (Tū of the angry face)
*Tū-tawake (Tū who hastens)
*Tū-te-ngaehe (Tū who tears apart)
*Tū-whakaheke-tangata (Tū the demoter of personages)
*Tū-whakamoana-ariki (Tū who enriches the sea)

== Earth&#x27;s creation ==
A traditional creation story tells that all the children of Rangi and Papa, the sky father and earth mother, lay in a tight embrace together, their children forced to crawl in the darkness between the two. One day, their children become so sick of this that they discuss a plan to separate them and allow light into the world. Tū advises his brothers to kill their parents, but the kinder proposal of Tāne is accepted and he instead forces the primordial pair apart.

In a Te Arawa version, Tū thinks about the actions of Tāne in separating their parents, and makes snares to catch the birds, the children of Tāne, who can no longer fly free. He then makes nets, and traps the children of Tangaroa. He makes holes to dig the ground, capturing his brothers Rongo-mā-Tāne and Haumia-tiketike, heaping them into baskets to be eaten. Of all the children of Ranginui and Papatūānuku, Tāwhirimātea fought Tūmatauenga to a standstill and forced him to withdraw, making him the only brother that Tūmatauenga cannot subdue completely, whose storms and hurricanes attack humankind to this day because of his indignation at the actions of his brothers.

Although Ranginui and Papatūānuku were not human in form, Tūmatauenga and his brothers were. Humankind - the descendants of Tūmatauenga - increased upon the earth, until the generation of Māui and his brothers.

Tūmatauenga&#x27;s actions against his brothers provide a pattern for human activities. Because Tūmatauenga defeated his brothers, people can now, if they perform the appropriate rituals, kill and eat birds (the children of Tāne), fish (the children of Tangaroa), cultivate and harvest plants for food (the children of Rongo-mā-Tāne and Haumia-tiketike), and generally harness the resources of the natural world. Tūmatauenga is also the originator of warfare, and people make war now because Tūmatauenga provided the example. When rituals were performed over warriors before a battle, or when an infant was dedicated to a future role as a fighter, Tūmatauenga was invoked as the source of their duty. The body of the first warrior to fall in a battle was often offered up to Tūmatauenga. While Tūmatauenga is the origin of war, powerful local deities such as Kahukura, Maru, or Uenuku were also called upon during times of war.

==In popular culture==
A song by Alien Weaponry, (&quot;eat people&quot;), from the album constantly refers to Tūmatauenga, as the god of war; cannibalism was a part of warfare for the Māori. also referred to the &quot;people eaters&quot; - or groups of men tasked with fighting and gathering food. In addition, Kaitangata was a mortal who was taught how to fish.

Tūmatauenga is mentioned by name in the 2022 &quot;&quot;, when Thor lists the gods who reside in Omnipotent City.

<text>York County is both the southernmost and the westernmost county in the U.S. state of Maine, along the state of New Hampshire&#x27;s eastern border. It is divided from Strafford County, New Hampshire, by the Salmon Falls River and the connected tidal estuary, the Piscataqua River. York County was permanently established in 1639. Several of Maine&#x27;s earliest colonial settlements are found in the county, which is the state&#x27;s oldest and one of the oldest in the United States. As of the 2020 census, its population was 211,972, making it Maine&#x27;s second-most populous county. Its county seat is Alfred. York County is part of the Portland–South Portland, Maine Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

===1622 patent===
The first patent establishing the Province of Maine was granted on August 10, 1622, to Ferdinando Gorges and John Mason by the Plymouth Council for New England, which itself had been granted a royal patent by James I to the coast of North America between the 40th and the 48th parallels &quot;from sea to sea&quot;. This first patent encompassed the coast between the Merrimack and Kennebec rivers, as well as an irregular parcel of land between the headwaters of the two rivers. In 1629, Gorges and Mason agreed to split the patent at the Piscataqua River, with Mason retaining the land south of the river as the Province of New Hampshire.

Gorges named his more northerly piece of territory New Somersetshire. This venture failed, however, because of lack of funds and colonial settlement. Also failed was a venture by Capt. Christopher Levett, an agent for Gorges and a member of the Council for New England. With the King&#x27;s blessing, Levett embarked on a scheme to found a colony on the site of present-day Portland. Levett was granted of land, the first Englishman to own the soil of Portland. There he proposed to found a settlement named York after the city of his birth in England. Ultimately, the project was abandoned, the men Levett left behind disappeared, and Levett died aboard ship on his return to England from the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. One part of Levett&#x27;s scheme did survive: the name of York, which now adorns the county.

The now-decommissioned Fort Levett on Cushing Island in Casco Bay is named for Capt. Levett.

===1639 patent===
In 1639, Gorges obtained a renewed patent, the Gorges Patent, for the area between the Piscataqua and Kennebec Rivers, in the form of a royal charter from Charles I of England. The area was roughly the same as that covered in the 1622 patent after the 1629 split with Mason. The second colony also foundered for lack of money and settlers, although it survived the death of Gorges in 1647.

===Absorption by Massachusetts===
In the 1650s the nearby Massachusetts Bay Colony asserted territorial claims over what is now southern Maine, and by 1658 had completely absorbed what is now southwestern Maine into York County, Massachusetts.

The first known and recorded offer for a purchase of land in York County is in 1668, when Francis Small traded goods with the Newichewannock tribe of this area. Their Chief Wesumbe, also known as Captain Sandy, was friendly with Small and warned him of a plot against his life. A group of renegade tribesmen planned on murdering Small instead of paying him with the furs that were owed to him. Small escaped after watching his house in what is now Cornish, Maine, burn to the ground. Small returned and rebuilt. The Chief made up the loss by selling Small all the lands bounded by the Great and Little Ossipee Rivers, the Saco River, and the New Hampshire border. Known now as the five Ossipee towns, the tract included all of Limington, Limerick, Cornish (formerly named Francisborough), Newfield and Parsonsfield.

The large size of the county led to its division in 1760, with Cumberland and Lincoln counties carved out of its eastern portions. When Massachusetts adopted its state government in 1780, it created the District of Maine to manage its eastern territories. In 1805 the northern portion of York County was separated to form part of Oxford County. When Maine achieved statehood in 1820 all of the counties of the District of Maine became counties of Maine.

==Politics==
Historically, York County was one of the more Democratic counties in Maine, a solid Republican state for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. York backed Democrat Woodrow Wilson in both 1912 and 1916, and voted for the Democratic nominee in each election from 1936 to 1948, even as the state as a whole backed the Republican in each of those elections. It was also one of only two counties in Maine to back Democrat John F. Kennedy in 1960 (Androscoggin was the other). Since 1952, it has voted for the statewide winner in each presidential election, except for 1976 when Democrat Jimmy Carter won York County while the state as a whole voted for Republican Gerald Ford. Although home to the Bush family compound, it only supported the Bush family in one of its four presidential runs (that of George H. W. Bush in 1988). Democrat Joe Biden became the first candidate from any party to break 70,000 votes in the county, doing so in 2020.

At the same time, it has voted for Republican Senator Susan Collins in all of her reelection campaigns, most recently in 2020.

==Government==
Washington County is considered to be a more conservative county in Maine. No Democrat has carried a majority of the county since Hubert Humphrey in 1968. In 2004, it was one of only two counties (the other being Piscataquis County) in Maine to vote for Republican George W. Bush over Democrat John Kerry. The county voted for the winning presidential candidate in every election from 1980 until 2020, when the county was carried by Donald Trump, who lost nationally to Joe Biden.

In the 2012 Maine Republican presidential caucuses, the majority of Washington County voters cast their votes for Republican Ron Paul, but votes from Washington County were not counted because of snow. Mitt Romney ultimately won the state by a narrow margin.

Waldo was one of a handful of counties nationwide that voted for independent Ross Perot in 1992. In each election since 2004, Waldo County has been won by a Democrat, but never with more than 55% of the vote.

It is the only one of the three Maine counties that voted Perot for president in 1992 that did not vote for Donald Trump in either of his presidential runs, supporting Democrats since the early 21st century. Trump only lost the county by 62 votes in 2016, but lost it by larger margin in 2020.

<text>Sagadahoc County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of Maine. As of the 2020 census, the population was 36,699. Its county seat is Bath. In geographic area, it is the smallest county in Maine.

Sagadahoc County is part of the Portland–South Portland, ME Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

===Exploration and settlement===
Sagadahoc County was initially part of York and, later, Lincoln County before being set off and incorporated in 1854. The name comes from the &quot;Sagadahoc River&quot;, an early name for the Kennebec River. Samuel de Champlain led the first known visit of Europeans to the region. In 1607, the English Popham Colony was established in what is now Phippsburg; it was abandoned a year later, but English fishermen and trappers continued to visit the area. John Smith explored the region in 1614 and reported back to King Charles I, who named the Sagadahoc area &quot;Leethe.&quot;

When the Plymouth Council for New England was dissolved in 1635, on the east side of the Kennebec River were divided up and granted to private owners. Over the years, these proprietors extended their claims through additional land grants, purchases from Native Americans, and exploitation of the often poorly defined boundaries of their lands. By 1660, Englishmen held the titles to the whole of what is now Sagadahoc County.

When King Philip’s War broke out in 1675, the plundering of one house was the only hostile act in Sagadahoc County until August 1676, at which point three settlements were attacked and 53 people taken captive by Native Americans. The region was almost totally abandoned by settlers, and no permanent settlement was established until 1715, when Arrowsic and Brunswick were founded. Scotch-Irish Presbyterians began immigrating to the region in increasingly large numbers, though occasional violence persisted until 1759, when the French and Indian Wars ended in Maine.

===Later conflicts===
There were no significant conflicts in Sagadahoc during the American Revolutionary War, despite fear of attack from British cruisers. Two British armed vessels sailed up the Kennebec River toward Bath, but turned back after being attacked. In the War of 1812, the capture of HMS &quot;Boxer&quot; occurred nearby. During the Civil War the county furnished to the Union forces 2,488 men.

===Nineteenth century===
Steam power was first used on the Kennebec as early as 1818 for propelling boats. What became the Bath branch of the Maine Central Railroad was completed in 1849; and the Knox and Lincoln Railroad was opened in 1871. The first newspaper was published in the county in 1820.

Sagadahoc County was set off from Lincoln and incorporated in 1854, with Bath as the county seat. Its valuation in 1870 was $11,041,340. In 1880 it was $10,297,215. The polls in 1870 numbered 4,669, and in 1880, 5,182. The population in 1870 was 18,803. In 1880 it was 19,276.

From 1880 to 2000, the county&#x27;s population nearly doubled to 35,214.

<text>Piscataquis County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of Maine. As of the 2020 census, its population was 16,800, making it Maine&#x27;s least-populous county. Its county seat is Dover-Foxcroft. The county was incorporated on March 23, 1838, taken from the western part of Penobscot County and the eastern part of Somerset County. It is named for an Abenaki word meaning &quot;branch of the river&quot; or &quot;at the river branch.&quot;

Originally, the county extended north to the Canada–US border, but in 1844 its northern portion was annexed by Aroostook County. In terms of land area, Piscataquis is one of the largest U.S. counties east of the Mississippi River. It is also one of two counties in the Northeast (and seven counties east of the Mississippi River) that meet Frederick Jackson Turner&#x27;s requirements for &quot;frontier&quot; country – that is, having fewer than six inhabitants per square mile, the other being Hamilton County, New York.

<text>James Stirling (11 May O.S. 1692, Garden, Stirlingshire – 5 December 1770, Edinburgh) was a Scottish mathematician. He was nicknamed &quot;The Venetian&quot;.

The Stirling numbers, Stirling permutations, and Stirling&#x27;s approximation are named after him. He also proved the correctness of Isaac Newton&#x27;s classification of cubic plane curves.

==Biography==

Stirling was born on 11 May 1692 O.S. at Garden House near Stirling, the third son of Archibald Stirling (1651-1715) and Anna Hamilton, and grandson of Archibald Stirling, Lord Garden, (1617-1668).

At 18 years of age he went to Balliol College, Oxford, where, chiefly through the influence of the Earl of Mar, he was nominated in 1711 to be one of Bishop Warner&#x27;s exhibitioners (or Snell exhibitioner) at Balliol. In 1715 he was expelled on account of his correspondence with his cousins, who were members of the Keir and Garden families, who were noted Jacobites, and had been accessory to the &quot;Gathering of the Brig o&#x27; Turk&quot; in 1708.

From Oxford he made his way to Venice, where he occupied himself as a professor of mathematics. In 1717 appeared his &quot;Lineae tertii ordinis Newtonianae, sive . . .&quot; (8vo, Oxford). While in Venice, also, he communicated, through Isaac Newton, to the Royal Society a paper entitled &quot;Methodus differentialis Newtoniana illustrata&quot; (&quot;Phil. Trans.&quot;, 1718). Fearing assassination on account of having discovered a trade secret of the glassmakers of Venice, he returned with Newton&#x27;s help to London about the year 1725.

In London he remained for ten years, being most part of the time connected with an academy in Tower Street, and devoting his leisure to mathematics and correspondence with eminent mathematicians. In 1730 his most important work was published, the &quot;Methodus differentialis, sive tractatus de summatione et interpolatione serierum infinitarum&quot; (4to, London), which is something more than an expansion of the paper of 1718. In 1735, he communicated to the Royal Society a paper &quot;On the Figure of the Earth, and on the Variation of the Force of Gravity at its Surface.&quot;

In the same year he was appointed manager for the Scots Mining Company at Leadhills, where the Scots Mining Company House was built for him in 1736. His next paper to the Royal Society was concerned, not with pure but with applied sciences; specifically, a trompe, i.e., a water-powered air compressor that was used by a Scottish lead mine. His name is also connected with another practical undertaking, since grown to vast dimensions. The accounts of the city of Glasgow for 1752 show that the very first instalment of ten million sterling spent in making Glasgow a seaport (a sum of £28, 4s. 4d.), was for a silver tea-kettle to be presented to &quot;James Stirling, mathematician, for his service, pains, and trouble in surveying the river towards deepening it by locks.&quot;

Another edition of the &quot;Lineae tertii ordinis&quot; was published in Paris in 1797; another edition of the &quot;Methodus differentialis&quot; in London in 1764; and a translation of the latter into English by Halliday in London in 1749. A considerable collection of literary remains, consisting of papers, letters and two manuscript volumes of a treatise on weights and measures, are still preserved at Garden.

==Politics==
From 1880 to 1988, Oxford County was dominated by the Republican Party in presidential elections, only failing to back a Republican candidate in 1912 (the county backed Progressive Theodore Roosevelt, who was a former Republican), 1964 (backing Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson, who won every county in Maine in a 46-state landslide), and 1968 (backing Democrat Hubert Humphrey, who had chosen Oxford County native Edmund Muskie as his running mate). The county flipped in 1992 to become consistently Democratic like the rest of Maine, staying that way through 2012. However, it made a 27.8 point swing (the largest statewide) to back Republican Donald Trump in 2016 as he won Maine&#x27;s second congressional district containing the county. Trump retained the county in 2020.

==Transportation==
U.S. Route 1 passes through the county in a northeast–southwest fashion. North-south Maine state routes, notably Maine 27, Maine 129, Maine 130 and Maine 32 travel north to the interior of the county and south to the peninsulas by the coast.

Until 1958, the Maine Central Railroad ran passenger trains from Portland, along the Rockland Branch from Brunswick to Rockland to the east, three trains a day on days besides Sunday and fewer trains on Sunday. Stations consisted of Wiscasset, Newcastle, Damariscotta Mills, Nobleboro, Winslow Mills and Waldoboro. In Portland&#x27;s Union Station, these trains made connections to trains to Boston, New York City, Bangor and the Canadian Maritimes. In the final months, service diminished to one daily except Sunday trip in each direction, until finally discontinuing on April 4, 1959.

From 2003 to 2015, the Maine Eastern Railroad offered seasonal excursion service to Rockland, Maine which connected to Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Downeaster&quot; at Brunswick. In October 2017, the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority announced plans to extend one weekend &quot;Downeaster&quot; round trip to Rockland between Memorial Day and Labor Day beginning in 2018. Intermediate stops would be made at Bath, Wiscasset, and Newcastle. As part of preparation, Amtrak, along with the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority, Maine Department of Transportation and the Central Maine and &amp; Quebec Railroad, made a test run of a train on August 14.

==Economy==
Of employed persons 16 years and over in 1990, 1,108 indicated involvement in the &quot;agriculture, forestry and fisheries&quot; industry, though 1,206 indicated &quot;farming, forestry and fishing occupations.&quot; The U.S. Census data are not dependable for determining the numbers of individuals involved in the fishing industry. Only firms with 10 or more employees must report their numbers, as well as firms paying workmen&#x27;s compensation insurance. Because the majority of fishermen in Maine are considered self-employed, the statistics underreport fishing employment.

Cranberry Isles, Deer Isle, Frenchboro, Gouldsboro, Southwest Harbor, Stonington, Swans Island and Tremont (Bass Harbor) were identified by a key respondent as fisheries dependent. Bar Harbor, Brooklin, Brooksville, Hancock, Lamoine, Mount Desert, Penobscot, Sedgwick, Sorrento and Sullivan were also noted as having either significant fishing activity or a significant number of people who fish. Winter Harbor&#x27;s fishing activities were once dwarfed by the economic activity associated with a naval base, but now that the naval base has closed, fishing activity will most likely be the dominant economic activity in the community. Salmon farming is also popular in the area and Maine Salmon is an important export.

Hancock County has the longest coastline of any Maine county. Commercial fishing and tourism are the county&#x27;s most important industries. Hancock County is home to Acadia National Park (the only national park in Maine or the New England region, excluding the national sea shore on Cape Cod) and Cadillac Mountain (the highest point in Maine&#x27;s coastal region). Jackson Laboratory, noted for cancer research, is located in Bar Harbor. Two institutions of higher education are located in Hancock County: Maine Maritime Academy at Castine and the College of the Atlantic at Bar Harbor.

== Air pollution ==

The American Lung Association issues annual State of the Air reports. Their current score card gives Hancock county an &quot;F&quot; for ozone pollution, the only Maine county to receive an F score.

==Government and politics==
The county&#x27;s Commissioners are William F. Clark, John Wombacher and Paul Paradis.

From 1856 to 1988, Hancock County was a Republican stronghold, with Democrats only carrying the county in three of the 34 presidential elections. Since then, Democrats carried the county every time, although George W. Bush came within one percent of taking the county in 2000.

==Politics==
Historically, like much of Maine, Franklin County was strongly Republican. For over 100 years after the founding of the Republican Party in 1854, the county voted against the Republican nominee for President just once, in 1912 when Progressive Theodore Roosevelt (a former Republican) carried the county. It voted for Democratic nominee Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 as part of his major landslide victory. It would also go Democratic in 1968, an election in which Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey chose Maine Senator Edmund Muskie as his running mate. The county snapped back to the Republicans for every election from 1972 to 1988, before voting Democratic for each election between 1992 and 2012. The county backed the statewide winner in every election from 1916 to 2012.

In 2016, the county deviated from the state as whole for the first time in over 100 years by voting for Republican Donald Trump even as the state was carried by Democrat Hillary Clinton. This trend continued in 2020, with the county again backing Trump even as the state voted for Joe Biden.

===Voter registration===


















==Government==
Franklin County is governed by a three-member county commission. Commissioners meet at 10am on the first and third Monday of each month and are elected in the November general election, serving four year terms. Currently, the three commissioners are:

District One: Gary McGrane (Jay, Wilton, Temple, Carthage)

District Two: Charles Webster (Farmington, Chesterville, New Sharon)

District Three: Clyde Barker (Avon, Carrabassett Valley, Coplin Plantation, Dallas Plantation, Eustis, Industry, Kingfield, New Vineyard, Phillips, Rangeley Plantation, Rangeley, Sandy River Plantation, Strong, Weld, and unorganized territories of East Central Franklin, North Franklin, South Franklin, West Central Franklin and Wyman)

Commissioner Charles Webster was appointed by Governor Paul LePage in 2015 to serve out the rest of Fred Hardy&#x27;s term, who died on July 4. Webster and Barker are members of the Republican Party, while McGrane belongs to the Democratic Party.

Franklin County belongs to Maine Prosecutorial District Three, which is composed of Franklin, Oxford and Androscoggin Counties. The current district attorney is Andrew S. Robinson, of Farmington who was elected to his first term in 2014. The deputy district attorney is James A. Andrews, who was appointed to that post by Robinson in 2015.

The current county treasurer is Pamela Prodan. She was elected to that position in 2014 and will serve a four term through December 2018. Prodan succeeded Mary Frank, who decided to retire instead of running for a second term. The duties of county treasurer include: overseeing fiscal accounting matters, including paying bills, collecting amounts owed the county, reserve/investment accounts, maintaining the county&#x27;s financial records and other matters related to the county&#x27;s finances.

==Law enforcement==
Only five municipalities in Franklin County have their own police department (Carrabassett Valley, Farmington, Jay, Rangeley, and Wilton). The Franklin County Sheriff&#x27;s Department is responsible for patrol and emergency calls in the remaining communities in the county without their own agency. The current sheriff is Scott Nichols, of New Sharon. Nichols was elected to that post in November 2012, defeating incumbent sheriff, Dennis Pike. Pike had spent 46 years in Franklin County law enforcement prior to being defeated by Nichols.

The status of the Franklin County Jail has been contentiously debated issue within the county and state for several years. In 2008, Governor John Baldacci signed into law a bill which consolidated county jails in an effort to reduce costs. As a result, the Franklin County jail was designated a 72-hour holding facility. Any inmates who needed to be held longer than the three-day maximum had to be transported to the Somerset County Jail in East Madison, which county jail officials said was a waste of department time and money. Jail consolidation has also led to jail overcrowding statewide. When the Somerset Jail reached its maximum capacity, inmates were forced to be transported to another jail within the state, sometimes hours away which Franklin County officials again said wasted time and money.

In 2012, the Somerset County Commissioners voted not to accept any more inmates from outside the county as the state Board of Corrections withheld its third quarter payment. While the vote allowed current inmates to stay at the jail, it required all future inmates to be sent to Two Bridges Regional Jail in Wiscasset. In 2013, the Maine Legislature&#x27;s Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee voted 11–0 to allow the Franklin County jail to return to full service status.

In 2014, the Franklin County Commissioners voted to withhold all payments to the state for jail inmates. Public outrage over the jail issue also pressured the state to give the county full service rights. In 2014 an 800-member Facebook group was created and several protests were staged in front of the county courthouse. In 2015, the State Board of Corrections voted to grant the county a fully operational jail, officially ending the seven year conflict between the county and the state.
