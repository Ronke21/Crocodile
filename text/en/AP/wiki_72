<doc id="102260" wikidata="Q768621" url="?curid=102260" title="Hanson (band)">
<text>Hanson is an American pop rock band from Tulsa, Oklahoma, formed by brothers Isaac Hanson (guitar, vocals, bass, piano), Taylor Hanson (keyboards, vocals, percussion), and Zac Hanson (drums, vocals, piano). Supporting members include Dimitrius Collins (guitar, additional keyboard) and Andrew Perusi (bass), who have toured and performed live with the band since 2007.

Hanson is best known for the 1997 hit song &quot;MMMBop&quot; from their debut album released through Mercury/Polygram Records, entitled &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot;, which earned three Grammy nominations. At the time of the music video, the boys were 16, 14, and 11 years old. The group&#x27;s label Mercury Records was merged with its sister labels and the band were moved to Island Def Jam Music Group. After releasing one album with them, the band left the label. 

Hanson has sold over 16 million records worldwide and have had three top 20 albums in the United States. They have had three top 20 US Hot 100 singles and eight UK top 40 singles. The band now records under their own label 3CG Records.

==History==
===1992–1996: Early years===
In the early to mid-1990s, Isaac, Taylor, and Zac sang a cappella and recorded such classic songs as &quot;Rockin&#x27; Robin&quot;, &quot;Splish Splash&quot;, and &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;, as well as their own material. Their first performance as a professional group took place in 1992 at the Mayfest Arts Festival in Tulsa. They were known as the Hanson Brothers, before shortening the name to Hanson in 1993.

Hanson also appeared on Carman&#x27;s &quot;Yo! Kidz: The Vidz&quot;, which cast Taylor as a young Biblical David facing Goliath, Isaac as an event announcer, and Zac and other members of the family in the stands cheering on this &quot;sporting event&quot;.

All three boys started their musical careers as pianists, but Isaac eventually started playing guitar and Zac started playing drums, while Taylor continued as the keyboard player. The band recorded two independent albums in their hometown of Tulsa, &quot;Boomerang&quot; (recorded in autumn 1994, released in 1995) and &quot;MMMBop&quot; (released in 1996). The latter featured the original version of the song &quot;MMMBop&quot;, which later became the runaway single on their debut commercial record &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot;. The band played in Austin during the South By Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas, which led to them being signed by manager Christopher Sabec. He shopped them to several record companies, most of which dismissed the band as a novelty before Steve Greenberg, an A&amp;R representative for Mercury Records, heard them play a set at the Wisconsin State Fair. After this performance, they were signed almost immediately by Mercury. They soon became a worldwide sensation with the release of their first major-label album, &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot;, which was produced by Stephen Lironi and the Dust Brothers.

===1997–2000: Commercial success===

&quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot; was released in the US on May 6, 1997, selling 10 million copies worldwide. May 6 was declared &#x27;Hanson Day&#x27; in Tulsa by Oklahoma&#x27;s then-governor Frank Keating. Although &#x27;Hanson Day&#x27; was originally intended to be a one-time occurrence, the band celebrates it each year with a party for fans in Tulsa. 

Hanson&#x27;s popularity exploded during the summer of 1997, and Mercury Records released Hanson&#x27;s first documentary &quot;Tulsa, Tokyo, and the Middle of Nowhere&quot; and their Christmas album &quot;Snowed In&quot; in the wake of their success. Hanson also launched &quot;MOE&quot; (which stood for Middle of Everywhere), a fan club magazine that ran for 12 issues. After numerous unauthorized biographies of each of the brothers were published, Hanson turned to their close friend, Jarrod Gollihare of Admiral Twin, to write their authorized biography. &quot;Hanson: The Official Book&quot; reached number 9 on the New York Times Best Sellers List (nonfiction) on February 1, 1998. The band was nominated for three Grammy Awards in 1998: Record of the Year, Best New Artist, and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. 

During the summer of 1998, Hanson began a highly successful concert tour, the Albertane Tour. They performed a string of shows throughout stadiums and arenas across North America and Europe, targeting young audiences with a playful and energetic style. A live album, titled &quot;Live From Albertane&quot;, was released the following fall, as well as their second documentary &quot;The Road to Albertane&quot;.

In response to the demand for their earlier work, Hanson re-released &quot;MMMBop&quot; as &quot;3 Car Garage&quot;, minus four tracks, in May 1998. Three tracks from &quot;Boomerang&quot; (&quot;Boomerang&quot;, &quot;More Than Anything&quot;, and &quot;Rain (Falling Down)&quot;) and two of the remaining tracks from &quot;MMMBop&quot; (&quot;Incredible&quot; and &quot;Baby (You&#x27;re So Fine)&quot;) were released on the first MOE CD sent to fan club members.

During the Albertane Tour, Hanson wrote and demoed what became the songs for their second major studio album, &quot;This Time Around&quot;. During this time period, Mercury Records, the band&#x27;s label, had been merged with Island Def Jam. In May 2000, Hanson released their second album, &quot;This Time Around&quot;, but due to lack of promotional funding, sales were low and the label eventually pulled funding for their tour. The band toured the Americas through the summer and fall of 2000 on their own funds.

===2001–2005: Independent career===
After a three-year struggle, the brothers left Island Def Jam Records to seek more creative freedom. Label executives had refused over 80 songs from the band, believing new material lacked marketability. The documentary film &quot;Strong Enough to Break&quot; follows these events.

Hanson now records for their own independent label, 3CG Records. The label has distribution deals through Alternative Distribution Alliance in the United States, Cooking Vinyl in Europe, Sony Music in Asia and with various other distributors throughout the world. During the dispute with their former label, Hanson signed with the management company, 10th Street Entertainment, which also manages artists such as Blondie.

The band&#x27;s Underneath Acoustic tour took place during the Summer and Fall of 2003 across the US, with one show in Canada and one in the UK. Music included acoustic versions of songs from the then-forthcoming release, &quot;Underneath&quot;. The tour ended November 5, 2003 with a performance at Carnegie Hall.

Released on April 20, 2004, &quot;Underneath&quot; sold 37,500 copies in the first week of release in the US alone. The album debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Independent Albums chart and No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, making &quot;Underneath&quot; one of the most successful self-released albums of all time. Hanson&#x27;s The Underneath Tour took them across the globe for nearly a full year (July - December 2004; March - June 2005).

In autumn 2005, Hanson toured in the US and Canada to support &quot;The Best of Hanson: Live &amp; Electric&quot;. They also visited colleges to showcase &quot;Strong Enough to Break&quot;, the documentary chronicling difficulties with and departure from Island Def Jam. During college visits, the band held question-and-answer sessions about independent artists&#x27; role in the music industry.

===2006–2008: &quot;The Walk&quot; and tenth anniversary===
On January 15, 2007, Hanson released on iTunes the first episode of their documentary podcast &quot;Taking the Walk&quot;, detailing production of the studio album. The first episode of the band&#x27;s documentary &quot;Strong Enough to Break&quot; was also released on iTunes. The program is edited into 13 episodes for release as a podcast.

In March 2007, Hanson began a &quot;preview tour&quot; to promote &quot;The Walk&quot; and give fans a taste of recent work. Over six days, Hanson performed at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey, Toad&#x27;s Place in New Haven, Connecticut, The Crocodile Rock in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and The Supper Club in New York City. On March 30, Taylor and Zac appeared in Dallas, TX to screen their documentary at the AFI Film Festival. Afterward, the brothers held a Q&amp;A session along with director Ashley Greyson. Hanson performed in the UK during April 2007, playing songs from &quot;The Walk&quot;. They also promoted the release of the single &quot;Go&quot; and the UK release of the album.

&quot;The Walk&quot;, Hanson&#x27;s second studio album with 3CG Records, was released in the US, Mexico and Canada on July 24. It was released in Japan on February 21 and in the UK on April 30. As part of this album&#x27;s tour and promo, the band hosted &quot;Take the Walk&quot; events where fans were encouraged to walk one mile to raise money and awareness of AIDS/HIV in Africa. The band partnered with Tom&#x27;s Shoes to give shoes to children in Africa.

In support of The Walk album, the band toured extensively throughout 2007-2008, predominantly in the US, with some shows in Canada, the UK, and Ireland. The tours were called The Walk Tour, and The Walk Around the World Tour.

On May 6, 2007, the 10th anniversary of Hanson Day, the band re-recorded their first major label album, &quot;Middle Of Nowhere&quot;, at The Blank Slate bar in their hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma. The band invited fan club members to attend, causing hundreds to fly to Oklahoma for the acoustic event. The record &quot;Middle of Nowhere Acoustic&quot; was released at the end of that year, exclusively on Hanson.net. The record included all but three songs of those originally in &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot; (&quot;Speechless&quot;, &quot;Thinking of You&quot; and &quot;With You in Your Dreams&quot;) and featured the song &quot;Yearbook&quot;, never performed live before.

===2009–2012: &quot;Shout It Out&quot;===
In June 2009, Hanson completed the album &quot;Shout It Out&quot; and planned to release it on June 8, 2010. The band also announced that they would be co-headlining a tour with Hellogoodbye. The tour, called Use Your Sole, started in Hanson&#x27;s hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma, on September 30, 2009 and finished November 11, 2009 in Anaheim, California.

Hanson also released a five-song EP titled &quot;Stand Up, Stand Up&quot; that was available at shows and on the band&#x27;s official website. The tracks are acoustic versions of four new Hanson songs, plus the album version of &quot;World&#x27;s on Fire&quot; which was originally going to be on their album &quot;Shout It Out&quot; but was ultimately left off the album. It was released worldwide on iTunes on December 8, 2009.

In December 2009, Hanson announced they would play five consecutive concerts at New York&#x27;s Gramercy Theater. Each concert featured one of the band&#x27;s four previous albums in its entirety, and the premiere of their upcoming Spring 2010 release. Dubbed &#x27;Five of Five&#x27;, the engagement began with a performance of Hanson&#x27;s major label debut, &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot;, on April 26, 2010 and then moved onto 2000&#x27;s &quot;This Time Around&quot; on April 27, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Underneath&quot; followed on April 28 with 2007&#x27;s &quot;The Walk&quot; on April 29. On April 30, the band unveiled their new album, &quot;Shout It Out&quot;. The concert series was also streamed live on band&#x27;s official website, Hanson.net, and included an exclusive &quot;Backstage Pass&quot; stream for fan club members. On March 6, 2010, Hanson shot dance and other sequences for their upcoming music video of their new single, &quot;Thinking &#x27;Bout Somethin&#x27;&quot;, at Greenwood Avenue in Tulsa. Hanson recruited professional dancers for the shoot and also invited fans and local residents to take part in the video, which is an homage to the Blues Brothers. The video was directed by Todd Edwards, co-founder of Blue Yonder Films. It was released for public viewing on their MySpace channel on April 15, 2010. &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic has a cameo appearance as the tambourine player.

On June 8, 2010, Hanson&#x27;s fifth studio record was released. &quot;Shout It Out&quot; debuted at number 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number 2 on the Indie chart, and No. 16 on the digital chart. On June 15, 2010, the band&#x27;s free concert at the South Street Seaport in New York City rather incongruously ended in a riot after an estimated 20,000 fans showed up at a venue which could only accommodate half that many people. The rapper Drake was also on the bill. Hanson offered a &quot;platinum package&quot; of their &quot;Shout it Out&quot; record which included artwork hand-painted by band member Zac Hanson. In October 2010, Hanson released &quot;The 113 Painting Book&quot; which includes the paintings created for these packages. To promote their new album, &quot;Shout It Out&quot;, Hanson toured from July 2010 through November 2010. The tour kicked off in Buffalo, New York on July 21, with the final show in Toronto, on November 23. Throughout the tour, the band broadcast live streams from their website. The footage included introducing the local musician winners of their opening band contest, a few full length concerts, and walks with fans to fight AIDS and poverty in Africa for their Take the Walk Campaign. One of the most notable concerts included two days in November at Walt Disney World Resort&#x27;s Food and Wine Festival for the Eat to the Beat concert series.

The band released a second single from &quot;Shout It Out&quot; in 2011. &quot;Give a Little&quot; reached Top 40 on the US Hot AC charts, making it the first top 40 hit for the band since their 2000 single &quot;If Only&quot;. The band resumed their touring activity in September 2011. The US Musical Ride Tour lasted from September 4 to November 1. Starting on November 6 in São Paulo, Brazil, they proceeded to tour Latin America and Europe in order to promote their &quot;Shout It Out&quot; album internationally. In early 2012, they toured Canada with Carly Rae Jepsen. Later in 2012, they took the Shout It Out world Tour to Philippines and Australia as well.

===2013–2020: &quot;Anthem&quot;, &quot;Finally It&#x27;s Christmas&quot; and &quot;String Theory&quot;===
Their sixth album &quot;Anthem&quot; was released on June 18, 2013. The album charted at number 22 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it their eighth album to reach the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; the album also peaked at number 5 on the US Independent Albums chart. The first single is titled &quot;Get the Girl Back&quot;, which was released on April 9, 2013. The single charted at number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Pop Songs.

On October 23, 2013, Hanson served as guest judges on the popular show &quot;Cupcake Wars&quot;. Four cupcake bakers fought to the finish for the chance at having their cupcakes at a concert and an after party with the band, and a $10,000 prize.

On March 16, 2017, Hanson announced their 25th anniversary tour called &quot;Middle of Everywhere: 25th Anniversary Tour&quot; to celebrate the band&#x27;s first signed album release.

Hanson released their second Christmas album, &quot;Finally It&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, on October 27, 2017. They also performed a &quot;Finally It&#x27;s Christmas&quot; special, which can be found on YouTube. In 2018, they performed backing vocals on the title song for Mike Love&#x27;s solo album &quot;Reason for the Season&quot;.

In July 2018, Hanson announced a symphonic tour and accompanying album, titled &quot;String Theory,&quot; inspired by their bucket list desire to play with a symphony orchestra at iconic venues such as the Sydney Opera House and the Greek Theatre. The tour began in August 2018 and saw them touring the world performing with the backing of local symphony orchestras. The album was released on November 9, 2018 with the symphonic composition recorded in Prague, led by Academy award winning arranger David Campbell. Hanson performed their highlight shows at the Sydney Opera House in Australia over the two nights of March 4th and 5th 2019. Their parents, Walker and Diana, flew to Australia to see their sons perform in the hallowed space. Whilst in Australia, the band played some side gigs at The Melbourne Zoo without the orchestra backing.

On September 13, 2019, Hanson announced their Wintry Mix tour in North America, featuring Paul McDonald and Joshua and the Holy Rollers, led by the youngest Hanson brother, Mac Hanson.

During the Wintry Mix tour, Zac was injured in a motorcycle accident on October 2, 2019. Despite the incident, the tour continued, with Zac on percussions and former HAIM drummer Dash Hutton filling in for him.

The band held a series of in-person concerts with accompanying livestreams in Tulsa from October 2020 to January 2021. At each show, 180 in-person tickets were available, making up 10% of the usual capacity of the venue. The theme in October was Live &amp; Electric Revisited&quot;, in November it was &quot;Perennial Live&quot;, in December &quot;The Christmas Ball&quot;, and in January &quot;Listener&#x27;s Choice&quot;. Some fans took issue with the band holding these concerts during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the series, the band also released &quot;Perennial&quot;, a compilation album with a selection of 20 songs previously only released to fan club members, plus the new song &quot;Nothing Like a Love Song&quot;.

===2021: &quot;Against the World&quot;===
The seven-track album, &quot;Against the World&quot; was released officially in November 2021 after the band released a song a month with a corresponding video over the course of seven months in 2021. The album was recorded at FAME studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The album&#x27;s theme is about facing adversity in its many forms, and seeking a way forward.

===2022: &quot;Red Green Blue (RGB)&quot;===

The album &quot;RGB (Red Green Blue)&quot; was released in 2022. &quot;Red Green Blue&quot; is a blend of a 5-song mini album crafted by each individual brother: &quot;RED&quot; for Taylor, &quot;GREEN&quot; for Isaac and &quot;BLUE&quot; for Zac. Each brother produced their third of the album individually with the help of award-winning producers Jim Scott and David Garza, with two of the three band members, Zac and Taylor, writing all their songs, whereas Isaac wrote a couple of songs, covered a song of their younger brother Mac&#x27;s band, and co-wrote the remaining songs.

Each portion is unique to the individual brother, but doesn&#x27;t stick to one genre. Taylor Hanson&#x27;s &quot;Red&quot; portion tends to lean more toward a rootsy Americana sound. For Isaac&#x27;s &quot;Green&quot; portion, there&#x27;s more of an intimate and vintage sound. Zac&#x27;s &quot;Blue&quot; has a more contemporary sound, mixing in pop, rock and alt-country. The three released singles from the album. Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Child At Heart&quot; depicts a series of inflicted wounds and tragedies as a metaphor for the pain of life and love. It sees Taylor getting punched and a glass of water thrown on him in the video clip. Isaac&#x27;s &quot;Write You A Song&quot; was written for his daughter, Odette who requested he write a song for her. She features in the clip that was premiered on CMT. Zac&#x27;s song &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot; features Frankie Muniz and a cast of others in the beefcake fun video.

Hanson set out on a world tour from June to November 2022.

The brothers were featured in the July 18, 2022, issue of &quot;People&quot; discussing their career thus far, family commitments, and being on the road. The article also showcased photos of their individual family members.

On May 26, 2023, English band Busted released a cover version of &quot;MMMBop&quot; in collaboration with Hanson, titled &quot;MMMBop 2.0&quot;.

==Other projects and appearances==
Hanson pioneered many things in the early days of the internet. In 1997, they were one of the first major label bands to have a website and an email address that was promoted in the sleeve of their album, Middle of Nowhere. By 1999 they had their own virtual world, Hanson World, and launched Hanson.net, a paid-membership fan portal that gave users exclusive content. The band started live-streaming and uploading videos to their website around this time too, before YouTube existed. A phone hotline also existed to give fans a record message from the band with their latest news.

Hanson occasionally host a song writing retreat known as Fools Banquet (sporadically between 2004 and 2015), where they invite musician friends to spend a week collaborating on writing and recording new songs. In the early years, most of the songs that came from Fools Banquet collaborations featured on Hanson&#x27;s fan club only albums. Artists that have attended over the years include Andrew W.K., Ben Kweller, Imani Coppola, Sandra McCracken, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, Adam Green and Pedro Yanowitz. Some songs that have been born and released as a result of Fools Banquet collaborations have been: We are All Women released by Andrew W.K. and Battle Cry released by both Hanson and Everybody Else.

Back to the Island (BTTI) is a week long destination concert event for fans that is held annually at a resort in Jamaica. During BTTI, attendees have the opportunity to participate in exclusive events with each member of the band, obtain exclusive merchandise, plus see the band give live performances.

In early 2009, Taylor Hanson launched a separate project including members of Smashing Pumpkins, Fountains of Wayne and Cheap Trick called Tinted Windows, a power pop quartet whose debut album quickly earned critical praise and repeat airplay on leading syndicated FM radio programs.

Hanson was the musical guest at the Tulsa stop of The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour starring Conan O&#x27;Brien on May 15, 2010. Conan accompanied the band in playing a cover of the song &quot;Never Been to Spain&quot; by American rock legends Three Dog Night.
In June 2010, Hanson performed with former &quot;American Idol&quot; contestant Siobhan Magnus.

As an April Fools&#x27; Day joke in 2011, Hanson covered the song &quot;Wait and Bleed&quot; by the heavy metal band Slipknot, and the website Shockhound claimed that Hanson would record an entire album of Slipknot covers.

On April 25, 2011, Hanson sang their hit &quot;MMMBop&quot; on the American version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. The band also makes a cameo in Katy Perry&#x27;s music video for her song &quot;Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)&quot;. 

In 2012, Hanson were mentioned in an episode of &quot;The Mentalist&quot; titled Ruby Slippers, as Grace Van Pelt admits her room was full of their posters when she was a teenager.

In May 2013, they launched their own beer: Mmmhops. The Hanson brothers partnered with craft beer company Mustang Brewing to create the drink as their way of raising a toast to their 21st anniversary. Hanson shared the first taste of the beer with those attending the premiere of &quot;The Hangover Part III&quot;.

Hanson appeared as dining room guests in the 15th episode of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; season 13.

In 2015, Hanson appeared on Blues Traveler&#x27;s album &quot;Blow Up the Moon&quot;, co-writing the song &quot;Top of the World&quot;. In June 2015, they appeared on Owl City&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Mobile Orchestra&quot;, in the song &quot;Unbelievable&quot; as his third single for the album.

In July 2016, the group performed on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.

In 2016, the band performed the song &quot;Him or Me&quot;, a cover of the song by Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders, on Bun E. Carlos&#x27; solo album called &quot;Greetings From Bunezuela!&quot;

On May 29, 2017 (Memorial Day), Hanson performed live on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; to commemorate their 25th year together and promote their new song.

In 2019, the band made a cameo appearance in Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;.

In 2021, Hanson competed in season five of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as the &quot;Russian Dolls&quot;, being the first band to compete on the series. The character performed in two costumes during the first and fifth performances and performed in three costumes for the second and third performances. Performances that utilized four costumes had one of them being used as a prop. When unmasked by Nick Cannon and the Men in Black on Week 9 of the fifth season, Taylor, Isaac, and Zac Hanson were underneath the main Russian Doll costume. Their elimination in May 2021 coincided with the release of &quot;Annalie&quot;, the first single from their 2021 seven-single album &quot;Against the World&quot;.

==Philanthropy==
In July 2006, the band recorded with a school choir in Soweto, South Africa to create &quot;Great Divide&quot;, which was released in the UK and U.S. through iTunes in December 2006. All proceeds from the song were directed toward research and prevention of AIDS in Africa.

On September 10, 2007, Hanson began &quot;The Walk Tour&quot; in Nashville. During the tour, Hanson continued their work against poverty and AIDS in Africa, partnering with an American company, TOMS Shoes. As part of TOMS&#x27; &quot;Shoe Drop&quot;, for every pair of shoes sold, the company donated another pair for a child in Africa.

==Controversies==
Details of Zac&#x27;s Pinterest account were leaked in November 2020, described by Ashley Spencer of &quot;Vice&quot; as &quot;a trove of pro-gun memes, many of which were racist, transphobic, homophobic, and sexist&quot;. The now-deleted account shared memes that commentators characterized as supporting George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin, comparing the right to use an AR-15 rifle with Rosa Parks&#x27; right to sit on a bus, suggesting that men cannot support gun control without being gay, and insisting that any &quot;man wanting to dress like a woman&quot; must be mentally ill. After first defending the posts, he apologized and said, &quot;The leaked Pinterest page provided a distorted view of the issues surrounding race and social justice, which do not reflect my personal beliefs. I apologize for the hurt my actions caused.&quot;

Later that month, Isaac addressed the COVID-19 pandemic and wrote on his Instagram story that Christians would soon have to decide whether their faith was more important than &quot;their fear&quot; due to Christmas, Easter, and Thanksgiving being &quot;cancelled&quot; by the government. He also wrote that he &quot;will not comply&quot; and that he fears God more than death or the government. He later apologized and said, &quot;What I shared was driven by an emotional reaction to a recent personal experience. I&#x27;m sorry for the pain and worry that my posts caused. I don&#x27;t believe there is a group conspiring against Christmas, only that I hope value is placed on both practices of safety and of faith.&quot;

<text>John Edward Zerzan ( ; born August 10, 1943) is an American anarchist and primitivist author. His works criticize agricultural civilization as inherently oppressive, and advocates drawing upon the ways of life of hunter-gatherers as an inspiration for what a free society should look like. Subjects of his criticism include domestication and symbolic thought (such as language, number, art and the concept of time).

His six major books are &quot;Elements of Refusal&quot; (1988), &quot;Future Primitive and Other Essays&quot; (1994), &quot;Running on Emptiness&quot; (2002), &quot;Against Civilization: Readings and Reflections&quot; (2005), &quot;Twilight of the Machines&quot; (2008), and &quot;Why hope? The Stand Against Civilization&quot; (2015).

== Early life and education ==

Zerzan was born in Salem, Oregon, and is of Czech and Slovakian descent. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from Stanford University in 1966. From 1967 to 1970, Zerzan worked as a union organizer for the Social Service Employees’ Union in San Francisco. Zerzan returned to school and received a master&#x27;s degree in history from San Francisco State University in 1972. He completed his coursework towards a PhD at the University of Southern California but dropped out in 1975 before completing his dissertation.

== Activism ==

In 1966, Zerzan was arrested while performing civil disobedience at a Berkeley anti-Vietnam War march and spent two weeks in the Contra Costa County Jail. He vowed after his release never again to be willingly arrested. He attended events organized by Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters and was involved with the psychedelic drug and music scene in San Francisco&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury neighborhood.

In the late 1960s he worked as a social worker for the city of San Francisco welfare department. He helped organize a social workers’ union, the SSEU, and was elected vice president in 1968, and president in 1969. The local Situationist group Contradiction denounced him as a &quot;leftist bureaucrat&quot;.

In 1974, Black and Red Press published &quot;Unions Against Revolution&quot; by Spanish ultra-left theorist Grandizo Munis that included an essay by Zerzan which previously appeared in the journal &quot;Telos&quot;. Over the next 20 years, Zerzan became intimately involved with the &quot;Fifth Estate&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Demolition Derby &quot; and other anarchist periodicals. He began to question civilization in the early 80s, after having sought to confront issues around the neutrality of technology and division of labour, at the time when Fredy Perlman was making similar conclusions. He saw civilization itself as the root of the problems of the world and that a hunter-gatherer form of society presented the most egalitarian model for human relations with themselves and the natural world.

Zerzan became more widely known during the trial of Ted Kaczynski. After reading the Unabomber manifesto, Zerzan went to Colorado to experience the trial and meet with Kaczynski in-between proceedings. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Kenneth B. Noble took interest in Zerzan&#x27;s sympathies and published an interview titled &quot;Prominent Anarchist Finds Unsought Ally in Serial Bomber&quot; that raised his national profile. Kaczynski eventually split from Zerzan and the anarcho-primitivists with the belief that leftist causes were a distraction.

In a 2014 interview, Zerzan stated that he and Kaczynski were &quot;not on terms anymore.&quot; He criticized his former friend&#x27;s 2008 essay &quot;The Truth About Primitive Life: A Critique of Anarchoprimitivism&quot; and expressed disapproval of Individuals Tending Towards the Wild, a Mexican group influenced by the Unabomber&#x27;s bombing campaign.

In 2014, Zerzan engaged in a public debate against Zoltan Istvan at Stanford University. Zerzan and Istvan hold differing views on technology, with Istvan stating on &quot;HuffPost&quot; that their views on the subject are polar opposites of each-other. Zerzan is an anarcho-primitivist and therefore considers technology inherently harmful to humanity, animals and nature and Planet Earth more generally. Istvan is a transhumanist and considers technology as a beneficial to humanity, animals and nature and Planet Earth more generally.

Zerzan was associated with the Eugene, Oregon anarchist scene.

== Thought ==

Zerzan is an anarchist philosopher, and is broadly associated with the philosophies of anarcho-primitivism, green anarchism, anti-civilisation, post-left anarchy, neo-luddism, and in particular the critique of technology.

Zerzan has accused linguist and activist Noam Chomsky of not being a real anarchist, saying that he is instead &quot;a liberal-leftist politically, and downright reactionary in his academic specialty, linguistic theory. Chomsky is also, by all accounts, a generous, sincere, tireless activist -- which does not, unfortunately, ensure his thinking has liberatory value.&quot;

=== Radio show ===

One method Zerzan uses to promote his Anarcho-primitivist ideas is with his radio show &quot;AnarchyRadio&quot; on KWVA at 88.1 FM in Eugene, Oregon and live-streamed worldwide by the station&#x27;s website with archive recordings of full shows available on John Zerzan&#x27;s own website. Zerzan&#x27;s website states that he started the show in 2000 although the recorded archive of shows on the site only goes back to 2006. Zerzan&#x27;s show airs live on Tuesdays on KWVA at 7pm PST and lasts an hour. Besides Zerzan himself, &quot;AnarchyRadio&quot; occasionally has a co-host with Zerzan and also fills in for Zerzan entirely when he is on speaking tours. &quot;AnarchyRadio&quot; is a call-in show and listeners can phone KWVA during the show and talk to the host(s) live. Until 2024, &quot;AnarchyRadio&quot; aired every Tuesday. Since 2024, &quot;AnarchyRadio&quot; now only airs on the second and fourth Tuesdays of the month. This new scheduling was introduced unofficially in February with an announcement at the end of the February 27 airing and later became official when Zerzan announced it at the start of the March 26 airing, claiming it was &quot;more manageable&quot; for him at his age of 80 years.

In 2014, &quot;AnarchyRadio&quot; gained unwanted media attention when it was discovered by the New York Daily News that Adam Lanza (who was the shooter in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012) once called the show in December 2011 and spoke to Zerzan live on air. Lanza called during the December 20 2011 show. Lanza did not use his real name and gave his name as &quot;Greg&quot; while calling Zerzan. Lanza also disguised his voice while calling as &quot;Greg&quot;. During the seven minute call, Greg/Lanza talked about the chimpanzee Travis who lived in Lanza&#x27;s home state of Connecticut and was notorious for an incident in 2009 where he tore off the face of Charla Nash (a friend of Sandra Herold, who kept Travis in her home as a pet) and was shot and killed shortly after 911 was called to house for help. This incident was considered as shocking because Travis raised by humans his whole life and was very friendly towards them. During the call, Greg/Lanza said that he was a fan of Zerzan&#x27;s work and stated that Travis was not &quot;an untamed monster&quot; but was actually &quot;civilized. He was able to integrate into society.&quot; One comment by Lanza drew particular attention from media in light of his actions was &quot;I just don&#x27;t think it would be such a stretch to say that he [Travis] very well could have been a teenage mall shooter or something like that.&quot; A day later, Lanza posted on the online forum &quot;Shocked Beyond Belief&quot; under the username &quot;Smiggles&quot; about the call to Zerzan. In an interview with TV station KMTR shortly the call surfaced, Zerzan stated that Lanza mentioning shooting &quot;and then again later he ends up doing it, I mean it&#x27;s just hard to grasp.&quot; Zerzan also notes that &quot;it&#x27;s tough to wrap your mind around, but then when you realize you spoke with the guy or listened to the guy, it&#x27;s all the more upsetting.&quot;

== Criticism ==

In his essay &quot;Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm&quot;, Murray Bookchin directed criticism from an anarchist point of view at Zerzan&#x27;s anti-civilizational and anti-technological perspective. He argued that Zerzan&#x27;s representation of hunter-gatherers was flawed, selective and often patronisingly racist, that his analysis was superficial, and that his practical proposals were nonsensical.

Aside from Bookchin, several other anarchist critiques of Zerzan&#x27;s primitivist philosophies exist. The pamphlet, &quot;Anarchism vs. Primitivism&quot; by Brian Oliver Sheppard criticizes many aspects of the primitivist philosophy. It specifically rejects the claim that primitivism is a form of anarchism.

Some authors such as Andrew Flood have argued that destroying civilization would lead to the death of a significant majority of the population, mainly in poor countries. John Zerzan responded to such claims by suggesting a gradual decrease in population size, with the possibility of people having the need to seek means of sustainability more close to nature.

Flood suggests this contradicts Zerzan&#x27;s claims elsewhere, and adds that, since it is certain that most people will strongly reject Zerzan&#x27;s supposed utopia, it can only be implemented by authoritarian means, against the will of billions.

In his essay &quot;Listen Anarchist!&quot;, Chaz Bufe criticized the primitivist position from an anarchist perspective, pointing out that primitivists are extremely vague about exactly which technologies they advocate keeping and which they seek to abolish, noting that smallpox had been eradicated thanks to medical technology.

In an essay called &quot;Anarchism = Zerzan?&quot;, socialist economist Michael Albert critiques Zerzan&#x27;s perspectives on concepts such as language, division of labour, and technology, instead saying that Zerzan&#x27;s argument rests on these concepts being inherently wrong, instead of, as Albert argues, being neutral concepts that can be utilised morally or immorally.

Noam Chomsky criticized the anarcho-primitivist viewpoint, saying that to end civilization essentially means killing billions of people.

<text>Benito Santiago Rivera (born March 9, 1965) is a Puerto Rican former professional baseball player. He played for 20 seasons as a catcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1986 to 2005, most prominently as a member of the San Diego Padres where he was a four-time Silver Slugger Award winner as well as a three-time Gold Glove Award winner. The five-time All-Star was considered the premier catcher in the National League (NL) during his tenure with the Padres. In 2015, Santiago was inducted into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame.

==Baseball career==

===Early years===
Santiago was signed as an amateur free agent by the San Diego Padres on September 1, 1982. After playing four seasons in the minor leagues, he made his Major League debut with the Padres on September 14, 1986 at the age of 21. The next year, Santiago established a Major League record for a rookie by hitting safely in 34 straight games. It was also the longest hitting streak by a catcher in major league history. He ended the season with what would be career-highs in hits (164), doubles (33) and batting average (.300). Santiago was the unanimous selection for the 1987 National League Rookie of the Year Award. Although he struggled defensively, leading the league in errors and passed balls, his hitting performance earned him the 1987 Silver Slugger Award which is awarded annually to the best offensive player at each position.
While Santiago initially made an impression with his offensive statistics, he soon became known for his defensive prowess, most notably for his strong throwing arm. Santiago was known for his ability to throw out would be base stealers from a kneeling position. In 1988, he led National League catchers in assists and in baserunners caught stealing with a 45% average when the league average was 30%. Although he still led the league&#x27;s catchers with 12 errors, it was an improvement over the 22 he had committed the previous season. Santiago was awarded the first of three consecutive Gold Glove Awards in 1988. Santiago also claimed his second successive Silver Slugger Award as the Padres improved to finish in third place in the National League Western Division.

Although he was hitting for only a .236 average at mid-season in 1989, his defensive reputation earned him the starting catcher&#x27;s role in the 1989 All-Star Game. He was awarded the 1989 National League Gold Glove Award for catchers, as the Padres climbed to second place in the season&#x27;s final standings.

Santiago rebounded in 1990 and was hitting for a .317 batting average with 9 home runs in mid-June when he was hit by a pitch and had to miss six weeks of the season. He finished the season with a .270 average along with 11 home runs and 53 runs batted in to earn his third Silver Slugger Award. He was also named as a reserve player for the National League team in the 1990 All-Star Game and won his third consecutive Gold Glove Award.

Before the 1991 season, Santiago asked for a four-year contract worth $11 million, but lost his arbitration case and was awarded a one-year contract worth $1.65 million. A disgruntled Santiago announced that he would leave the Padres when he became eligible for free agency after the 1992 season. He was also disillusioned when the Padres traded away players such as Joe Carter and Jack Clark. In June, Padres manager Greg Riddoch benched Santiago for his lack of hustle on the playing field. Despite the difficulties, Santiago led the league&#x27;s catchers with 100 assists and posted a career-high 87 runs batted in.

Santiago returned to arbitration before the 1992 season, this time winning a $3.3 million one-year contract that made him the highest paid catcher in professional baseball. In September 1992, the Padres announced that they would not seek to re-sign Santiago, in what was seen as a cost-cutting measure.
From 1991 to 1994, Santiago wore a jersey with the uniform number 09, making him one of the only major professional sports players to have ever worn a jersey with a leading zero as part of his uniform number.

===Decline and trades===
On December 16, 1992, Santiago signed with the newly established franchise Florida Marlins and hit the first home run in team history. Despite hitting for a .273 average in 1994, he was granted free agency after the season as the Marlins were ready to promote their young catching prospect, Charles Johnson. On April 17, 1995, the Cincinnati Reds signed him and he briefly recovered his form batting .286. On January 30, 1996, he joined the Phillies, where he became the first player to hit a grand slam off Greg Maddux in the regular season after Maddux had been pitching for nearly ten years. Santiago also hit a home run in four consecutive at bats in the same season. Santiago ended the season with a career-high 30 home runs, along with 85 runs batted in, for the last place Phillies.

Santiago then signed a contract to play for the Blue Jays (–) where he lost almost the entire 1998 season to a serious injury sustained in a car crash in Florida. A free agent again, he played 89 games for the Cubs in 1999 and played for Cincinnati in 2000.

===Resurgence with the Giants===
Santiago arrived in San Francisco on March 17, 2001. He played in 133 games and helped the Giants finish in second place, two games behind the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League West. He shared the 2001 Willie Mac Award with Mark Gardner, which recognized the spirit and leadership of each. Santiago had another good year in 2002, appearing in 126 games and finishing third among National League catchers with a .995 fielding percentage. He earned his fifth All-Star berth and ended the season with a .278 batting average with 74 runs batted in as the Giants once again finished second to the Diamondbacks and claimed the National League wild card berth.

The Giants defeated the Atlanta Braves in the first round of the play-offs then met the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2002 National League Championship Series. Santiago hit two home runs in the series along with 6 runs batted in, and was awarded the League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award as the Giants defeated the Cardinals in five games. In the 2002 World Series against the Anaheim Angels, Santiago delivered 5 runs batted in as the Giants were defeated in a seven-game series.

In 2003, the 38-year-old Santiago continued to perform well, hitting fifth in the batting order behind Barry Bonds, he appeared in 108 games while posting a .279 batting average with 56 runs batted in.

===Later years===
On December 11, 2003, Santiago, again a free agent, signed with the Kansas City Royals. By June 18, he was hitting .274 with six home runs and 23 RBI when he was hit by a pitch from Geoff Geary that broke his hand. After the 2004 season, the Royals traded him to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Leo Núñez, a minor league pitcher. The Pirates let Santiago go after a mere 23 at-bats in favor of giving playing time to young David Ross. Santiago signed with the New York Mets to a minor-league contract, but he appeared in only a handful of games. He opted out of his Triple-A contract, but did not play in the major leagues in 2006.

He was inducted into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame on August 8, 2015.

==Career statistics==
In a 20-year major league career, Santiago played in 1,978 games, accumulating 1,830 hits in 6,951 at bats for a .261 career batting average along with 217 home runs, 920 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .307. He ended his career with a .987 fielding percentage.

A five-time All-Star, Santiago was known for his strong defensive skills, leading National League catchers three times in assists, once in fielding percentage and once in baserunners caught stealing. As 2010 began, Santiago was tied for eighth on the all-time list of games caught with Brad Ausmus, with 1,917.

==Steroid allegations==
In 2003, Santiago was named by FBI investigators as one of the athletes alleged to have received anabolic steroids. He was linked to performance enhancers in the book &quot;Game of Shadows&quot;.

On December 13, 2007, Santiago was named in the Mitchell Report. &quot;At the end of the 2003 season, Mike Murphy, a Giants clubhouse attendant, was cleaning out Santiago&#x27;s locker when he found a sealed package of syringes,&quot; the report read. &quot;Murphy brought the syringes to the training room, handed them to [Stan] Conte, and told Conte that he had found them in Santiago&#x27;s locker. Conte responded that he &quot;would take care of it.&quot; Murphy recalled that the Giants’ assistant athletic trainer Dave Groeschner also was present in the training room during this conversation.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Santiago has a son named Benito Santiago Jr., who is a Puerto Rican professional basketball player who currently plays for the Mets of Guaynabo Coached by JJ Barea in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN), the top tier basketball league in Puerto Rico.

<doc id="102274" wikidata="Q460960" url="?curid=102274" title="Queen Máxima of the Netherlands">
<text>Máxima (born Máxima Zorreguieta on 17 May 1971) is Queen of the Netherlands since 2013 as the wife of King Willem-Alexander.

Argentine by birth, she worked in finance when she met Willem-Alexander, eldest son and heir apparent of Queen Beatrix, in 1999. They married in 2002, and became king and queen on the abdication of her mother-in-law on 30 April 2013. Máxima has promoted social integration of immigrants, LGBTQ rights, and financial inclusion. She and Willem-Alexander have three daughters, Princesses Catharina-Amalia, Alexia, and Ariane, who are first, second, and third, respectively, in the line of succession.

==Early life and education==
Máxima Zorreguieta was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 17 May 1971. She is the daughter of Jorge Zorreguieta (1928–2017), who served as Secretary of Agriculture under General Jorge Rafael Videla during Argentina&#x27;s last civil-military dictatorship (1976–1983), and his second wife, (born 1944). She is named after her paternal great-grandmother Máxima Bonorino González (1874–1965), of Italian and Spanish descent. Originally from the Basque country, her ancestor carrying the Zorreguieta surname, José Antonio Sorreguieta y Oyarzábal Gamboa y Sagastume, migrated to Argentina around the year 1790. Maxima&#x27;s father was a scion of the Zorreguieta family who had been landed gentry, professionals, regional politicians, and statesmen for generations. Her maternal great-grandfather was also from the landed gentry; Domingo Carricart Etchart (1885–1953) was a landowner, politician, Director of the &quot;Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires&quot;, first mayor of González Chaves, and mayor of Tres Arroyos. She also has Portuguese ancestry through her father&#x27;s side, and is a descendant of King Afonso III of Portugal.

She grew up in the Recoleta neighbourhood of Buenos Aires and studied at Northlands School, a bilingual school of the city of Olivos. She graduated with a degree in economics from the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina (UCA) in 1995. This private university is governed by a directory of local bishops, including the current Pope Francis, then Archbishop of Buenos Aires and Grand Chancellor of UCA. During her student years, Francis presided over the traditional Mass at the beginning of classes. She later completed her studies with a master&#x27;s degree in the United States.

From 1989 to 1990, while still in college, she worked for Mercado Abierto Electrónico S.A. From 1992 to 1995, she worked in the sales department of Boston Securities SA in Buenos Aires, where she conducted research on software for financial markets. From July 1996 to February 1998, she worked for HSBC James Capel Inc. in New York City, where she became vice president of institutional sales for Latin America. From then until July 1999, she was vice president of the emerging markets division of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in New York. From May 2000 to March 2001, she worked for Deutsche Bank in Brussels.

==Relationship with Willem-Alexander==


Máxima met Willem-Alexander in April 1999 in Seville, Spain, during the Seville Spring Fair. In an interview, they stated that he introduced himself only as &quot;Alexander&quot;, so that she did not know he was a prince. She thought he was joking when he later told her that he was the Prince of Orange and heir apparent to the Dutch throne. 
According to the unauthorised biography &quot;Máxima. La construcción de una reina&quot;, she was invited to Seville by a friend living in New York who openly said she would introduce her to two European princes.
They agreed to meet again two weeks later in New York, where Máxima was working for Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. Their relationship apparently began in New York.

The news of the couple&#x27;s relationship and eventual marriage plans caused controversy in the Netherlands, due to the involvement of Máxima&#x27;s father Jorge Zorreguieta as a cabinet minister during the National Reorganization Process, the most recent Argentine dictatorship. Her father&#x27;s 1979–1981 tenure as a minister took place during the later stages of the Dirty War (1974–1982), a period of repression that saw about 30,000 people killed or disappeared during the seven-year military regime. At the request of the States General, Michiel Baud, a Dutch professor in Latin American studies, carried out an inquiry into the involvement of Zorreguieta in the Dirty War. Zorreguieta claimed that, as a civilian, he was unaware of the Dirty War while he was a cabinet minister. Baud determined that Máxima&#x27;s father had not been directly involved in any of the numerous atrocities that took place during that period. However, Baud also concluded that Zorreguieta was almost certainly aware of them; in Baud&#x27;s view, it was highly unlikely that a cabinet minister would not have known about them. After becoming queen, Máxima&#x27;s popularity increased. As of 2024, she is the most popular Dutch royal.

A television series &quot;Máxima Zorreguieta: Motherland&quot; began airing on Videoland in the Netherlands in 2024. The series is set to focus on her early life in Argentina and meeting King Willem-Alexander.

==Marriage and family==
The couple announced their engagement on 30 March 2001; Máxima addressed the nation in Dutch (which at the time she only spoke at a basic conversational level) during the live televised broadcast. Máxima was granted Dutch citizenship by a royal decree on 17 May 2001 and now has dual citizenship: Argentine and Dutch. The engagement was formally approved by the States General later that year, a necessary step for Willem-Alexander to remain in line to the throne.

Máxima and Willem-Alexander were married on 2 February 2002 in a civil ceremony in the Beurs van Berlage, Amsterdam, which was then followed by a religious ceremony at Amsterdam&#x27;s Nieuwe Kerk (&quot;New Church&quot;). Máxima&#x27;s parents were not present at the wedding; her father was told he could not attend due to his role as a cabinet minister during the National Reorganization Process, and her mother chose not to attend without her husband.

==Activities==

Queen Máxima has a particular concern for the integration of immigrants into Dutch culture. She was a member of a special parliamentary commission which sought to recommend ways to increase the participation of female immigrants in the workforce. Máxima stresses the importance for immigrants of learning the Dutch language (as she did) in order to fully participate in Dutch society. Dutch is the Queen&#x27;s third language; she is also fluent in Spanish (her native language) and English. She speaks French at a conversational level.

In 2007, Máxima inadvertently caused a wave of massive criticism when in a speech to the Scientific Council for Government Policy she said that in the seven years that she had been in the Netherlands, she had been unable to &quot;find the Dutch identity&quot;. Maxima is quoted as having said the following:

She participates in conferences around the world representing the Netherlands. She was granted a seat in the Dutch Council of State on 20 October 2004, the highest advisory body and court of administration. She was a member of the Committee for Ethnic Minority Women&#x27;s Participation from July 2003 until 2005. She has a seat on the board of governors of the chair on the Management of Diversity and Integration at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; she (along with her husband) is a patron of the Orange Fund (established to promote social welfare and cohesion in the Netherlands); and she also chairs the Board of Trustees of the Prince Claus Chair in Development and Equity of the International Institute of Social Studies and the University of Utrecht.

Máxima attended a conference concerned with LGBT rights on 5 March 2008.

Queen Máxima has been honorary chair of the Money Wise Platform since 2010. In this capacity, the Queen focuses attention on the importance of financial education and managing money sensibly, especially where children and young people are concerned. The Queen acts as special advisor to the Platform and consults with interested parties on ways of increasing people&#x27;s financial awareness and resilience.

Since 10 June 2015, Queen Máxima has been the honorary chair of the Ambassadors for Music at School Platform. Queen Máxima has for some years been committed to giving as many children as possible the opportunity to create music.

Queen Máxima is a member of the Committee for Enterprise and Finance, which succeeded the Microfinance Council in 2011. The Queen is committed to extending the reach of various financing opportunities, both through coaching and by providing credit for new and existing small businesses in the Netherlands. She also works to increase the number of women entrepreneurs and the scope they have to expand their businesses.
Since March 2022 Queen Máxima is a Honorary President of &quot;MIND Us&quot; – a mental health platform created in collaboration with the MIND Foundation.

=== UNSGSA ===
Queen Máxima currently serves as the United Nations Secretary-General&#x27;s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development (UNSGSA). In September 2009 then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon designated her to this role in order to raise awareness on the importance of inclusive financial systems for achieving economic and development goals such as poverty alleviation, food security and education. In her work as UNSGSA, the Queen focuses on how formal financial services such as savings, insurance, and credit can prevent people from falling into poverty due to expenditures on healthcare, and people who are not able to protect themselves against rising food prices and poverty because they do not have access to basic savings accounts. The role of the UNSGSA is to foster action by governments, private sector, financial system standard setters, and others towards a more inclusive financial system that works for the poor. In later years, her focus as a special advocate expanded to advocating digital financial inclusion, financial health, responsible technology for financial inclusion to support Sustainable Development Goals and agricultural finance. Máxima is also an advocate for increasing access to financial services, improving consumer protection and enhancing financial literacy. According to the UNSGSA website, she &quot;aims to unlock development opportunities and economic inclusion for all.&quot;

Queen Máxima visited several countries on behalf of the United Nations. She also recorded a video for the launch of the Global Findex Database 2021. Queen Máxima is also the honorary patron of the G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI) since June 2011. In this role she works with governments and partners to advance the G20 Action Plan on Financial Inclusion, and the G20 Financial Inclusion Peer Learning Program. Previously, the Queen was a member of the Advisors Group for the United Nations&#x27; International Year of Microcredit 2005 and until 2009, was a member of UN Advisors Group on Inclusive Financial Sectors. She also work as the Global Agenda Trustee for the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Global Challenge Initiative on the Future of the Global Financial System. Máxima convened the CEO Partnership for Economic Inclusion.

==Titles, honours and arms==

By a decree issued on 25 January 2002, upon the solemnization of marriage, Máxima Zorreguieta was granted the titles Princess of the Netherlands and Princess of Orange-Nassau, and the style Royal Highness was formally conferred upon her. She also became &quot;mevrouw van Amsberg&quot; (Mrs. van Amsberg).

Another decree issued on the same day also granted her own personal coat of arms and a personal standard.

On 13 May 2011, the Dutch parliament confirmed that Máxima would become queen consort of the Netherlands upon her husband&#x27;s accession, after a debate over her future title and style. On 28 January 2013, it was announced that Queen Beatrix would abdicate on 30 April in favour of Willem-Alexander. Máxima is the kingdom&#x27;s first queen consort since Princess Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, the second wife of William III. She is the first Dutch queen to have been born as a commoner, and the first to have been born outside Europe.

<doc id="102282" wikidata="Q257464" url="?curid=102282" title="Sally Hemings">
<text>Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Hemings ( 1773 – 1835) was a woman enslaved to third President of the United States Thomas Jefferson, inherited among many others from his father-in-law, John Wayles.

Hemings&#x27; mother was Betty Hemings, the daughter of an enslaved woman and an English captain, John Hemings. Sally&#x27;s father, the owner of Betty, John Wayles, was also the father of Jefferson&#x27;s wife, Martha. Therefore, Sally was half-sister to Jefferson&#x27;s wife and was of (at least) three quarters English descent, making her a quadroon according to then-contemporary racial classification. Martha died during her marriage in 1782. In 1787, when she was 14, Sally Hemings accompanied Jefferson&#x27;s daughter, also named Martha, to Paris where they joined Thomas Jefferson. There, Sally was a legally free and paid servant as slavery was not legal in France. At some time during her 26 months in Paris, the widower Jefferson is believed to have begun intimate relations with her.

As attested by her son, Madison Hemings, Sally later agreed with Jefferson that she would return to Virginia and resume her life in slavery, as long as all their children would be freed when they came of age. Multiple lines of evidence, including modern DNA analyses, indicate that Jefferson impregnated Hemings several times over years while they lived together on Jefferson&#x27;s Monticello estate, and historians now broadly agree that he was the father of her six children. Whether this should be described as rape remains a matter of controversy by historians, as there is no evidence that Jefferson sexually assaulted her, but due to his near-complete control over her life, and that she was a teenager, between 14 and 16 years, when he was in his 40s, the circumstances for coercion are present. Four of Hemings&#x27; children survived into adulthood and were freed as they came of age during Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s life or in his will. Hemings died in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1835 in the home of her freed sons.

The historical question of whether Jefferson was the father of Hemings&#x27; children is the subject of the Jefferson–Hemings controversy. Following renewed historical analysis in the late 20th century, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation empaneled a commission of scholars and scientists who worked with a 1998–1999 genealogical DNA test that found a match between the Jefferson male line and a descendant of Hemings&#x27; youngest son, Eston Hemings. The Foundation&#x27;s panel concluded that Jefferson fathered Eston and likely her other five children as well. A rival society was then founded, the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society, which commissioned another panel of scholars in 2001 that found that it had not been proven that Thomas Jefferson fathered Sally Hemings&#x27; children; the panel, however, was unable to disprove that Thomas Jefferson had fathered her children. In 2018, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation of Monticello announced its plans to have an exhibit titled &quot;Life of Sally Hemings&quot;, and affirmed that it was treating as a settled issue that Jefferson was the father of her known children.

== Early life ==
Sally Hemings was born about 1773 to the enslaved Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Hemings and her mother&#x27;s owner, John Wayles. Betty&#x27;s parents were a &quot;full-blooded African&quot; slave and a white English sea captain surnamed Hemings. Captain Hemings tried to purchase the mother and his daughter Betty from their enslaver, Francis Eppes, but the planter refused out of curiosity about how the mixed ethnicities would turn out in Betty. Upon Eppes&#x27; death his daughter, Martha Eppes, inherited Betty, and took her as a personal slave upon her marriage to Wayles.

Wayles was born to Edward and Ellen (née Ashburner) Wayles, in Lancaster, England. Following Martha&#x27;s death, Wayles remarried and was widowed twice more. Several sources assert that Wayles took Betty Hemings as his concubine and that Sally was the youngest of the six children they had during the last 12 years of his life. These children were younger half-siblings to his daughters by his wives. His first child, Martha Wayles (named after her mother, Wayles&#x27; first wife), married the young planter and future president Thomas Jefferson.

The children of Betty Hemings and John Wayles were three-quarters European in ancestry and fair-skinned. According to the 1662 Virginia Slave Law, children born to slave mothers were considered slaves under the principle of : the enslaved status of a child followed that of the mother. Betty and her children, including Sally Hemings and all Sally&#x27;s children, were legally slaves even though the fathers were their white enslavers and the children were of majority-European ancestry.

John Wayles died in 1773 and the next year his daughter Martha and her husband, Thomas Jefferson, inherited the Hemings family among a total of 135 slaves from Wayles&#x27; estate, along with of land. Sally was an infant that year and about 25 years younger than Martha. She, her siblings, their mother Betty, and various other slaves were brought to Monticello, Jefferson&#x27;s home. The mixed-race Wayles-Hemings children grew up at Monticello at the top of the enslaved hierarchy, and as such were trained and given assignments as skilled artisans and domestic servants. Betty Hemings&#x27; other children and their descendants, also mixed race, were bestowed privileged assignments as well. None worked in the fields, but were still enslaved people without any legal status or rights.

=== Appearance ===
The former slave Isaac (Granger) Jefferson described Hemings&#x27; physical appearance as &quot;Sally was mighty near white. Sally was very handsome, long straight hair down her back&quot;. Jefferson&#x27;s grandson Thomas Jefferson Randolph recalled her as &quot;Light colored and decidedly good looking&quot;.

==Hemings in Paris==
In 1784, Thomas Jefferson was appointed the American to France; he took his eldest daughter Martha (Patsy) with him to Paris, as well as several of his slaves. Among them was Sally&#x27;s elder brother James Hemings, who became a chef trained in French cuisine. Jefferson left his two younger daughters in the care of their aunt and uncle, Francis and Elizabeth Wayles Eppes of Eppington in Chesterfield County, Virginia. After his youngest daughter, Lucy Elizabeth, died in 1784 while Jefferson was away, Jefferson sent for his surviving daughter, nine-year-old Mary (Polly), to live with him. The teenage slave, Sally Hemings, was chosen to accompany Polly to France after an older female slave became pregnant and could not make the journey. Correspondence between Jefferson and Abigail Adams indicates that Jefferson originally arranged for Polly to &quot;be in the care of her nurse, a black woman, to whom she is confided with safety&quot;; Adams wrote back: &quot;The old Nurse whom you expected to have attended her, was sick and unable to come. She has a Girl about 15 or 16 with her.&quot;

In 1787, Sally, aged 14 accompanied Polly to London and then to Paris. In London, they stayed with Abigail and John Adams from June 26 until July 10, 1787. Jefferson&#x27;s associate, a Mr. Petit, arranged transportation and escorted the girls to Paris. In a letter to Jefferson on June 27, 1787, Abigail wrote: 

The widowed Jefferson, aged 44 at the time, was serving as the United States Minister to France. Hemings spent two years there and most historians believe Jefferson and Hemings&#x27; sexual relationship began while they were in France or soon after their return to Monticello. The exact nature of their relationship remains unclear. The Monticello exhibition on Hemings acknowledged this uncertainty, while noting the power imbalance inherent in an intimate relationship between a successful, wealthy white male and a quarter-black female slave 30 years his junior. The president of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation said, &quot;We really can&#x27;t know what the dynamic was. Was it rape? Was there affection? We felt we had to present a range of views, including the most painful one.&quot; Hemings remained enslaved in Jefferson&#x27;s house until his death in 1826. In 2017, a room identified as her quarters at Monticello, under the south terrace, was discovered in an archeological examination. It is being restored and refurbished.

Sally Hemings remained in France for 26 months. Slavery had been abolished in that country after the Revolution in 1789; Jefferson paid wages to her and James while they were in Paris. He paid her the equivalent of $2 a month. In comparison, he paid James Hemings $4 a month as chef-in-training, and his Parisian scullion $2.50 a month; the other French servants earned from $8 to $12 a month. Toward the end of their stay, James used his money to pay for a French tutor and to learn the language, and Sally was also learning French. There is no record of where she lived: it may have been with Jefferson and her brother in the Hôtel de Langeac on the Champs-Elysées, or at the convent Abbaye de Penthemont where the girls Maria and Martha were schooled. Whatever the weekday arrangements, Jefferson and his retinue spent weekends together at his villa. Jefferson purchased some fine clothing for Hemings, which suggests that she accompanied Martha as a lady&#x27;s maid to formal events.

According to her son Madison&#x27;s memoir, Hemings became pregnant by Jefferson in Paris. She was about 16 at the time. Under French law, Sally and James were free and could have petitioned to stay; a return to Virginia meant a return to slavery. She agreed to return with him to the United States in exchange for his promise to free her children when they came of age (at 21). Hemings&#x27; strong ties to her mother, siblings, and extended family likely drew her back to Monticello.

==Return to the United States and children&#x27;s freedom==
In 1789, Sally and James Hemings returned to the United States with Jefferson, who was 46 years old and seven years a widower. As shown by Jefferson&#x27;s father-in-law, John Wayles, sexual relationships between wealthy Virginia widowers and female slaves were not unknown. White society simply expected such men to be discreet about them.

According to Madison Hemings, Sally&#x27;s first child died soon after her return from Paris. Hemings had six children after this; their complete names are in some cases uncertain:
* Harriet Hemings [I] (October 5, 1795 – December 1797)
* Beverly Hemings, possibly William Beverley Hemings (April 1, 1798 – after 1873)
* Daughter, possibly named Thenia Hemings after Sally&#x27;s sister (born in 1799 and died in infancy)
* Harriet Hemings [II] (May 1801 – Unknown)
* Madison Hemings, possibly James Madison Hemings (January 19, 1805 – November 28, 1877)
* Eston Hemings, possibly named Thomas Eston Hemings (May 21, 1808 – January 3, 1856)

Jefferson recorded births of slaves in his Farm Book. Unlike his practice in recording births of other slaves, he did not identify the father of Sally Hemings&#x27; children.

Sally Hemings&#x27; documented duties at Monticello included being a nursemaid-companion, lady&#x27;s maid, chambermaid, and seamstress. It is not known whether she was literate, and she left no known writings. She was described as very fair. She is believed to have lived as an adult in a room in Monticello&#x27;s &quot;South Dependencies&quot;, a wing of the mansion accessible to the main house through a covered passageway.

In 2017, the Monticello Foundation announced that what they believe to be Hemings&#x27; room, adjacent to Jefferson&#x27;s bedroom, had been found through an archeological excavation, as part of the Mountaintop Project. It was space that had been converted to other public uses in 1941. Hemings&#x27; room will be restored and refurbished as part of a major restoration project for the complex. Its goals include telling the stories of all the families at Monticello, both enslaved and free.

Hemings never married. Virginia law did not recognize the marriages of enslaved people, but many forced laborers at Monticello had recognized stable relationships with partners in common-law marriages. But unlike those others, Monticello records document Hemings in no such partnership, at any time. But she kept her children near her. According to her son Madison, while young, the children &quot;were permitted to stay about the &#x27;great house&#x27;, and only required to do such light work as going on errands&quot;. At the age of 14, each of the children began their training: the brothers with the plantation&#x27;s skilled master of carpentry, and Harriet as a spinner and weaver. The three boys were all taught and learned to play the violin, which Jefferson himself played.

In 1822, at the age of 24, Beverley left or &quot;ran away&quot; from Monticello and was not pursued. His sister Harriet Hemings, 21, followed in the same year, apparently with at least tacit permission. The overseer, Edmund Bacon, said that he gave her $50 ($1,131 in 2021) and put her on a stagecoach to the North, presumably to join her brother. In his memoir, published posthumously, Bacon said Harriet was &quot;near white and very beautiful&quot;, and that people said Jefferson freed her because she was his daughter. However, Bacon did not believe this to be true, citing someone else coming out of Sally Hemings&#x27; bedroom. The name of this person was left out by Rev. Hamilton W. Pierson in his 1862 book because he did not wish to cause pain to anyone living at that time.

Jefferson formally freed two slaves while he was alive: Sally&#x27;s older brothers Robert, who bought his freedom, and James, who was required to train his brother Peter as a chef for three years to get his freedom. Jefferson eventually (including posthumously, through his will) freed all of Sally&#x27;s surviving children, Beverly, Harriet, Madison, and Eston, as they came of age. (Harriet was the only female slave Jefferson allowed to go free, and these were the only slaves freed as they came of age.) Of the hundreds of slaves he legally owned, Jefferson freed only five in his will, all men from the Hemings family. They were also the only slave family group freed by Jefferson. Sally Hemings&#x27; children were seven-eighths European in ancestry, and three of the four entered white society after gaining their freedom; their descendants likewise identified as white. His will also petitioned the legislature to allow the freed Hemingses to stay in the state.

No documentation has been found for Sally Hemings&#x27; own manumission. Jefferson&#x27;s daughter Martha (Patsy) Randolph at least informally freed the elderly Hemings after Jefferson&#x27;s death, by giving her &quot;her time&quot;, as was a custom. As the historian Edmund S. Morgan has noted, &quot;Hemings herself was withheld from auction and freed at last by Jefferson&#x27;s daughter, Martha Jefferson Randolph, who was, of course, her niece,&quot; as Sally was a half-sister to Martha&#x27;s mother, Jefferson&#x27;s deceased wife. This informal freedom allowed Hemings to live in Virginia with her two youngest sons in nearby Charlottesville for the next nine years until her death. In the Albemarle County 1833 census, all three were recorded as free persons of color. Hemings lived to see a grandchild born in a house that her sons owned.

Although Jefferson inherited great wealth at a young age, he was bankrupt by the time he died. His estate, including his slaves (besides the Hemings), was sold at auction by his daughter Martha to repay his debts.

==Jefferson–Hemings controversy==

The Jefferson–Hemings controversy is the question of whether Jefferson impregnated Sally Hemings and fathered any or all of her six children of record. There were rumors as early as the 1790s. Jefferson&#x27;s sexual relationship with Hemings was first publicly reported in 1802 by one of Jefferson&#x27;s enemies, a political journalist named James T. Callender, after he noticed several light-skinned enslaved people at Monticello. He wrote that Jefferson &quot;kept, as his concubine, one of his own slaves&quot; and had &quot;several children&quot; by her. After that the story became widespread, spread by newspapers and by Jefferson&#x27;s Federalist opponents. Jefferson himself is never recorded to have publicly denied this allegation. However, several members of his family did. In the 1850s, Jefferson&#x27;s eldest grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, said that Peter Carr, a nephew of Jefferson, had fathered Hemings&#x27; children, rather than Jefferson himself. This information was published and became the common wisdom, with major historians of Jefferson denying Jefferson&#x27;s paternity of Hemings&#x27; children for the next 150 years.
In the late 20th century, historians began re-analyzing the body of evidence. In 1997, Annette Gordon-Reed published a book, &quot;Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy&quot;, that analyzed the historiography of the debate, demonstrating how historians since the 19th century had accepted early assumptions. They favored Jefferson family testimony while criticizing Hemings family testimony as &quot;oral history&quot;, and failed to note all the facts. A consensus began to emerge after the results of a DNA analysis, commissioned in 1998 by Daniel P. Jordan, president of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which operates Monticello as a house museum and archive. The DNA evidence showed no match between the Carr male line, proposed for more than 150 years as the father(s), and the one Hemings descendant tested. It did show a match between the Jefferson male line and the Eston Hemings descendant.

Since 1998 and the DNA study, several historians have concluded that Jefferson maintained a long sexual relationship with Hemings and fathered six children with her, four of whom survived to adulthood. In an article that appeared in &quot;Science&quot;, eight weeks after the DNA study, Eugene Foster, the lead co-author of the DNA study, is reported to have &quot;made it clear that Thomas was only one of eight or more Jeffersons who may have fathered Eston Hemings&quot;. The Thomas Jefferson Foundation (TJF) published in 2000 an independent historic review in combination with the DNA data, as did the National Genealogical Society in 2001; scholars involved mostly concluded Jefferson was probably the father of all Hemings&#x27; children.

In an interview in 2000, the historian Annette Gordon-Reed said of the change in historical scholarship about Jefferson and Hemings: &quot;Symbolically, it&#x27;s tremendously important for people ... as a way of inclusion. Nathan Huggins said that the Sally Hemings story was a way of establishing black people&#x27;s birthright to America.&quot;

A vocal minority of critics, such as the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society (TJHS, founded shortly after the DNA study), dispute Jefferson&#x27;s paternity of Hemings&#x27; children. All but one of 13 TJHS scholars expressed considerable skepticism about the conclusions. The TJHS report suggested that Jefferson&#x27;s younger brother Randolph Jefferson could have been the father – the DNA test cannot distinguish between Jefferson males. They also speculate that Hemings might have had consensual or non consensual sexual relations with multiple men. Three of the Hemings children were given names from the Randolph (surname) family, relatives of Thomas Jefferson through his mother. Herbert Barger, the founder and director-emeritus of the TJHS and the husband of a Jefferson descendant, assisted Foster in the DNA study. By contrast, all but one member of the DNA Study Committee commissioned by TJF thought that the DNA and documentary evidence combined made it probable that Thomas Jefferson was the father of one or more of the Hemings children.
TJF committee participant W. McKenzie (Ken) Wallenborn wrote a late-1999 minority report disagreeing with some aspects of the committee&#x27;s full report (not made public until 2000; TJF also published this dissent in 2000). While Wallenborn concurred with the validity of the genetic testing and with the documentary research collected, he disputed some of the interpretation, and concluded: &quot;The historical evidence is not substantial enough to confirm nor for that matter to refute [Jefferson&#x27;s] paternity of any of the children of Sally Hemings.&quot; He gave considerable weight to four pieces of non-genetic evidence. First are a pair of late letters of Jefferson to close associates which can be read as denials of adultery slanders spread by Federalist political enemies (though the letters do not specifically mention Hemings). Second is an unequivocal counterclaim made by Jefferson&#x27;s foreman Edmund Bacon and published by H. W. Pierson (with the name of the alleged actual father redacted). Third is that Col. Thomas Jefferson Randolph, who was frequently in his grandfather Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s household and who worked as his farm manager and was later his estate executor, was reported to have denied that any relations between Jefferson and any of the Hemings women existed, but claimed that resident nephew Peter Carr was involved with Sally, while her niece Betsey was openly the mistress of his brother Samuel Carr (though this account is third-hand). Finally, some materials claimed that Martha (Jefferson) Randolph and her sons demonstrated that Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings had been separated for some fifteen months before the birth of the son &quot;who most resembled&quot; Jefferson (presumed by Wallenborn to be Eston Hemings). In Wallenborn&#x27;s view, it was thus quite possible that Sally Hemings bore children to multiple men in the Jefferson/Randolph/Carr clan, and that none of them was necessarily Thomas Jefferson, but that the children were just genetically close, a &quot;Jefferson DNA Haplotype carrier&quot; in at least one case. He conceded that the DNA results &quot;enhance the possibility&quot; of Jefferson&#x27;s paternity of one or more of the Hemings children but do not prove it. This view is consistent with that expressed by the DNA study&#x27;s lead, Eugene Foster, regarding what could or could not be concluded from the DNA evidence. While supporting TJF&#x27;s continued education mission at Monticello, Wallenborn warned that &quot;historical accuracy should never be overwhelmed by political correctness&quot;.

Lucia Cinder Stanton, writing for the majority of the committee, responded a month later with a rebuttal. She noted that the Jefferson, Bacon/Pierson, and Randolph material contained various ambiguities, partisanship, timeline errors, and contradictions or outright misrepresentations. She suggested that Madison Hemings probably knew who his father was, and there was no evidence that ghostwriter Wetmore injected fiction even if he polished the wording for print. She also indicated that the claim of a Jefferson–Hemings separation during one conception period cannot be sustained, and that Wallenborn did not correctly understand that material. Stanton stated outright that &quot;Sally Hemings never conceived in Jefferson&#x27;s absence.&quot; TJF president Jordan, though he had insisted on publication of the Wallenborn dissent, endorsed the Stanton rebuttal.

The next month, May 2000, the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society (TJHS) emerged: 

Wallenborn (a former TJMF/TJF employee before his committee participate, and now a director of TJHS) produced in June a heated follow-up reply to Stanton&#x27;s rebuttal. He claimed that many scholars agreed with his version, and that Jordan had contradicted his support of Stanton&#x27;s, having expressing skepticism of a Jefferson–Hemings affair in a PBS-TV documentary (though it is unclear if this was recorded before the DNA research and subsequent report). Wallenborn repeated many of his original points in more detail; bolstered the potential reliability of Bacon while casting doubt of that of the Madison-via-Whetmore memoir; and insisted again that &quot;the son of Sally that most resembled Thomas Jefferson&quot; surely meant Eston (without any new evidence). He added the argument that Madison Hemings&#x27; probable date of conception was close to that of the death of Jefferson&#x27;s daughter Maria (arguably not a likely inspiration for sexual involvement); and that during Jefferson&#x27;s presidency, Sally Hemings&#x27; exact whereabouts did not survive in any records. Wallenborn attempted to use two sets of records to show gaps in Jefferson&#x27;s known location during some of the conception periods – but editorial interpolation of footnotes by Jordan with additional records closed those gaps in every case, supporting Stanton&#x27;s claim. Wallenborn added another new observation, of what he called &quot;some striking coincidences&quot;, that Sally Hemings&#x27; known pregnancies stopped, despite Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s presence, after both his brother Randolph and Randolph&#x27;s son Thomas married women outside Monticello, c. 1808 or 1809. Wallenborn accused TJF of rushing the report to finalization without accounting for his objections, and concluded his letter in a much more hostile tone than in his original minority report: &quot;If the Thomas Jefferson Foundation and the DNA Study Committee majority had been seeking the truth and had used accurate legal and historical information rather than politically correct motivation&quot; that it would have written &quot;it is still impossible to prove with absolute certainty whether Thomas Jefferson did or did not father any of Sally Hemings&#x27; five children&quot; (emphasis in original). He continued: &quot;This statement is accurate and honest and it would have helped discourage the campaign by leading universities (including Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s own University of Virginia), magazines, university publications, national commercial and public TV networks, and newspapers to denigrate and destroy the legacy of one of the greatest of our founding fathers and one of the greatest of all of our citizens.&quot; TJF did not publish any further back-and-forth disputation.

In 2012, the Smithsonian Institution and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation held a major exhibit at the National Museum of American History: &quot;Slavery at Jefferson&#x27;s Monticello: The Paradox of Liberty&quot;; it says that &quot;the documentary and genetic evidence ... strongly support the conclusion that [Thomas] Jefferson was the father of Sally Hemings&#x27; children.&quot;

==Children&#x27;s lives==
In 2008, Gordon-Reed published &quot;The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family&quot;, which explored the extended family, including James&#x27;s and Sally&#x27;s lives in France, Monticello and Philadelphia, during Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s lifetime. She was not able to find much new information about Beverley or Harriet Hemings, who left Monticello as young adults, moving north and probably changing their names.

Madison Hemings&#x27; memoir (edited and put into written form by journalist S. F. Wetmore in the &quot;Pike County Republican&quot; in 1873) and other documentation, including a wide variety of historical records, and newspaper accounts, has revealed some details of the lives of the Beverley and Harriet, and younger sons Madison and Eston Hemings (later Eston Jefferson), and of their descendants. Eventually, three of Sally Hemings&#x27; four surviving children (Beverley, Harriet, and Eston, but not Madison) chose to identify as white adults in the North; they were seven-eighths European in ancestry, and this was consistent with their appearance. Harriet was described by Edmund Bacon, the longtime Monticello overseer, as &quot;nearly as white as anybody, and very beautiful&quot;. In his memoir, Madison wrote that both Beverley and Harriet married well in the white community in the Washington, D.C., area. For some time, Madison wrote to Beverley and Harriet and learned of their marriages. He knew that Harriet had children and was living in Maryland. But gradually she and Beverley stopped responding to his letters, and the siblings lost touch. Madison also claimed publicly in the 1873 memoir that he was Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s son, and he had done likewise on the 1870 U.S. census.

Both Madison and Eston married free women of color in Charlottesville. After their mother&#x27;s death in 1835, they and their families moved to Chillicothe in the free state of Ohio. Census records classified them as &quot;mulatto&quot;, at that time meaning mixed-race. The census enumerator, usually a local person, classified individuals in part according to who their neighbors were and what was known of them. Around 60 years later, a Chillicothe newswriter reminisced in 1902 about his acquaintance with Eston (then a well-known local musician), whom he described as &quot;a remarkably fine looking colored man&quot; with a &quot;striking resemblance to Jefferson&quot; recognized by others, who had already heard a rumors of his paternity and were credulous of it.

High demand for slaves in the Deep South and passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 heightened the risk for free black people of being kidnapped by slave catchers, as they needed little documentation to claim black people as fugitives. Legally free people of color, Eston and his family later moved to Madison, Wisconsin, to be farther away from slave catchers. There he changed his name to &quot;Eston H. Jefferson&quot; to acknowledge his paternity, and all his family adopted the surname. From then on, the Jeffersons lived in the white community.

Madison&#x27;s family were the only Monticello Hemings descendants who continued to identify with the black community. They intermarried within the community of free people of color before the Civil War. Over time, some of their descendants passed into the white community, while many others continued within the black community.

Both Eston and Madison achieved some success in life, were well-respected by their contemporaries, and had children who built on their successes. They worked as carpenters, and Madison also had a small farm. Eston became a professional musician and bandleader, &quot;a master of the violin, and an accomplished &#x27;caller&#x27; of dances&quot;, who &quot;always officiated at the &#x27;swell&#x27; entertainments of Chillicothe&quot;. He was in demand across southern Ohio. The aforementioned journalist neighbor in Chillicothe described him thus: &quot;Quiet, unobtrusive, polite and decidedly intelligent, he was soon very well and favorably known to all classes of our citizens, for his personal appearance and gentlemanly manners attracted everybody&#x27;s attention to him.&quot;

==Grandchildren and other descendants==
===Madison&#x27;s descendants===
Madison&#x27;s sons fought on the Union side in the Civil War. Thomas Eston Hemings enlisted in the United States Colored Troops (USCT); captured, he spent time at the Andersonville POW camp and died in a POW camp in Meridian, Mississippi. According to a Hemings descendant, his brother James attempted to cross Union lines and &quot;pass&quot; as a white man to enlist in the Confederate army to rescue him. Later, James Hemings was rumored to have moved to Colorado and perhaps passed into white society. Like some others in the family, he disappeared from the record, and the rest of his biography remains unknown.

A third son, William Hemings, enlisted in the regular Union Army as a white man. Madison&#x27;s last known male-line descendant, William, never married and was not known to have had children. He died in 1910 in a veterans&#x27; hospital.

Some of Madison Hemings&#x27; children and grandchildren who remained in Ohio suffered from the limited opportunities for blacks at that time, working as laborers, servants, or small farmers. They tended to marry within the mixed-race community in the region, who eventually became established as people of education and property.

Madison&#x27;s daughter, Ellen Wayles Hemings, married Alexander Jackson Roberts, a graduate of Oberlin College. When their first son was young, they moved to Los Angeles, California, where the family and its descendants became leaders in the 20th century. Their first son, Frederick Madison Roberts (1879–1952) – Sally Hemings&#x27; and Jefferson&#x27;s great-grandson – was the first person of known black ancestry elected to public office on the West Coast: he served for nearly 20 years in the California State Assembly from 1919 to 1934. Their second son, William Giles Roberts, was also a civic leader. Their descendants have had a strong tradition of college education and public service.

===Eston&#x27;s descendants===
Eston&#x27;s sons also enlisted in the Union Army, both as white men from Madison, Wisconsin. His first son John Wayles Jefferson had red hair and gray eyes like his grandfather Jefferson. By the 1850s, John Jefferson in his twenties was the proprietor of the American Hotel in Madison. At one time he operated it with his younger brother Beverley. He was commissioned as a Union officer during the Civil War, during which he was promoted to the rank of Colonel and served at the Battle of Vicksburg. He wrote letters about the war to the newspaper in Madison for publication. After the war, John Jefferson returned to Wisconsin, where he frequently wrote for newspapers and published accounts about his war experiences. He later moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he became a successful and wealthy cotton broker. He never married or had known children, and left a sizeable estate.

Eston&#x27;s second son, Beverley Jefferson, also served in the regular Union Army, as a white man. After operating the American Hotel with his brother John, he later separately operated the Capital Hotel. He also built a successful horse-drawn &quot;omnibus&quot; business. He and his wife Anna M. Smith had five sons, three of whom reached the professional class as a physician, attorney, and manager in the railroad industry. According to his 1908 obituary, Beverley Jefferson was &quot;a likeable character at the Wisconsin capital and a familiar of statesmen for half a century&quot;. His friend Augustus J. Munson wrote, &quot;Beverley Jefferson[&#x27;s] death deserves more than a passing notice, as he was a grandson of Thomas Jefferson ... [He] was one of God&#x27;s noblemen – gentle, kind, courteous, charitable.&quot; Beverley and Anna&#x27;s great-grandson John Weeks Jefferson is the Eston Hemings descendant whose DNA was tested in 1998; it matched the Y-chromosome of the Thomas Jefferson male line.

There are known male-line descendants of Eston Hemings Jefferson, and known female-line descendants of Madison Hemings&#x27; three daughters: Sarah, Harriet, and Ellen.

==Cultural depictions of Sally Hemings==
Sally Hemings has been the main subject of a novel, a television mini-series, a stage play, two operas, and an operatic oratorio. She is also the subject of the second half of the film &quot;Jefferson in Paris&quot;. She has also appeared as a supporting character or a subject of discussion in many other shows and stage productions.

The power dynamic between Hemings and Thomas Jefferson is portrayed in Titus Kaphar&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Myth of Benevolence&quot;, a portrait of the founding father peeling back to reveal the nude figure of Hemings.

Jennie Lightweis-Goff draws a parallel between Hemings and La Malinche of Mexico, arguing that &quot;Stories of captive women in the arms of white women are hollowed out for purposes of mythmaking: aspirational racial reconciliation or pure allegory of domination. Think of Sally Hemings, who was in her teens when she began bearing children by Thomas Jefferson; she has been reduced to either First Girlfriend or First Victim, depending on era and purpose...without attention to the complexities of [her life].&quot;

<doc id="102283" wikidata="Q669468" url="?curid=102283" title="Joseph Ellis">
<text>Joseph John-Michael Ellis III (born July 18, 1943) is an American historian whose work focuses on the lives and times of the Founding Fathers of the United States. His book &quot;American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson&quot; won a National Book Award in 1997 and &quot;Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation&quot; won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for History. Both books were bestsellers.

==Early life and education==
Ellis was born in Alexandria, Virginia, on July 18, 1943. He received his B.A. from the College of William and Mary, where he was initiated into Theta Delta Chi. He earned his M.A. and Ph.D. from Yale University in 1969, where Edmund S. Morgan directed his dissertation on a colonial American theologian. At William and Mary, Ellis was in ROTC.

==Career==
Ellis entered the United States Army in August 1969 and spent three years teaching history at the United States Military Academy at West Point before being discharged a captain in 1972. Ellis later joined the faculty at Mount Holyoke College. In 1979, he was made full professor and later became the Ford Foundation Professor of History. He has also taught at Williams College and in the Commonwealth Honors College at the University of Massachusetts. His scholarly work has concentrated on the Founding Fathers of the United States, including biographies of John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington, the American Revolution, and the history of the Federalist Era, which lasted from 1788 to 1800.

Ellis served as dean of faculty at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts from 1980 to 1990; following that, he was named by the trustees to the endowed Ford Foundation Chair in history. For part of 1984, he also served as the college&#x27;s acting president while president Elizabeth Topham Kennan was on leave. Ellis was suspended without pay in 2001 after falsely telling his students that he had fought in the Vietnam War; he was reappointed to the chair four years later, in 2005. Ellis retired from Mount Holyoke in 2012.

===Presidential biographies===
Together with histories of the founding of the republic, since 1993 Ellis has written biographies about individual early presidents and, in 2010, a joint biography of John and Abigail Adams. Interested in how men shaped and were shaped by their times, he writes with a novelist&#x27;s emphasis on character. Ellis is notable as a respected scholar whose work has also gained popular success; his biography of Jefferson and work on the Founding Fathers have been bestsellers, attaining sales of hundreds of thousands of copies. In 2004, the critic Jonathan Yardley wrote of him: &quot;Ellis doubtless is now the most widely read scholar of the Revolutionary period, and thus probably the most influential as well—at least among the general public...&quot;

====John Adams====
As a result of his research, Ellis believed that John Adams was underappreciated as the nation&#x27;s second president; he worked to reveal the man&#x27;s contributions and character. His book, &quot;Passionate Sage: The Character and Legacy of John Adams,&quot; led to a revival of interest in Adams and new appreciation for his achievements.

====Thomas Jefferson====

In his book &quot;American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson&quot; (1996), Ellis explored the character and personality of Jefferson, and his many contradictions. He emphasized how important privacy was to him, and how the president and statesman preferred to work behind the scenes in politics, through letters, meetings and discussions over dinners. Ellis noted Jefferson&#x27;s success in this style.

In relation to one of the major questions about his private life, whether Jefferson had a liaison with his slave Sally Hemings, Ellis suggested that evidence was &quot;inconclusive.&quot; His deep analysis of Jefferson&#x27;s character led him to conclude that the statesman did not have the liaison. Specifically, Ellis says in the appendix to &quot;American Sphinx:&quot;
Unless the trustees of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation decide to exhume the remains and do DNA testing on Jefferson as well as some of his alleged progeny, it leaves the matter a mystery about which advocates on either side can freely speculate... This means that for those who demand an answer the only recourse is plausible conjecture, prefaced as it must be with profuse statements about the flimsy and wholly circumstantial character of the evidence. In that spirit, which we might call the spirit of responsible speculation, after five years mulling over the huge cache of evidence that does exist on the thought and character of the historical Jefferson, I have concluded that the likelihood of a liaison with Sally Hemings is remote.
On November 5, 1998, Dr. Eugene Foster and his team published the results of Y-DNA analysis of Jefferson male-line descendants (he had no known male descendants but Y-DNA is passed on virtually unchanged through direct male-line descendants) and descendants of others reputed to be associated with him. Foster reported that DNA results showed a match between the Jefferson male line and the descendant of Eston Hemings. Given that and other historical evidence, they concluded that Thomas Jefferson was the father of Eston and probably of Sally Hemings&#x27; other children. The study showed no match between the Carr line, named by two of Jefferson&#x27;s grandchildren as the father(s) of Hemings&#x27; children, and the Eston Hemings descendant, disproving the major alternative to Thomas Jefferson as father.

In interviews on &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot; in November 1998 and Frontline&#x27;s &quot;Jefferson&#x27;s Blood&quot; in 2000, Ellis made public statements about his change of opinion following the DNA studies, saying he believed that Jefferson had a long-term relationship with Sally Hemings.

===George Washington===
In &quot;His Excellency: George Washington&quot; (2004), Ellis sought to penetrate myth and examine Washington during three major periods of his life. Ellis described how Washington&#x27;s experiences in earlier leadership contributed to his actions and development as president. Ellis wrote that &quot;we do not need another epic [Washington biography], but rather a fresh portrait focused tightly on Washington&#x27;s character&quot;, which the critic Jonathan Yardley said he had achieved.

==False claims of combat service and anti-war leadership==
In June 2001, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; revealed that Ellis had misled his students in lectures and the media about his role in the Vietnam War years. Ellis falsely claimed that he had been involved in protests in the civil rights movement and anti-war movement in the 1960s. He also repeatedly claimed to have fought in the Vietnam War. In one of his lectures, Ellis stated that he had been involved in helping to clear an area near My Lai shortly before a well-known massacre was carried out in the village. In a 2000 interview, he claimed to have been a platoon leader, a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division, and to have served on the staff of General William Westmoreland in Saigon. In actuality, although he had been in the U.S. Army, Ellis had never served in Vietnam at all.

Ellis issued a public apology in August 2001. He cited rumors at Mount Holyoke campus that he had served in Vietnam but would not talk about it because of some disturbing experience as something that led him to fabricate claims of service. He said that he had felt guilty about not actually serving in Vietnam. In the ensuing controversy, Mount Holyoke suspended him without pay for a year. He returned to the classroom at the end of that time. However, Ellis was prohibited from again teaching his course on the 1960s, during which most of his fabrications were made. In May 2005, Mount Holyoke restored his position as Ford Foundation Professor of History.

==Personal life==
Ellis currently lives in Vermont with his wife Ellen Wilkins Ellis, and is the father of three adult sons.

<doc id="102286" wikidata="Q57696" url="?curid=102286" title="Curt Sachs">
<text>Curt Sachs (; 29 June 1881 – 5 February 1959) was a German musicologist. He was one of the founders of modern organology (the study of musical instruments). Among his contributions was the Hornbostel–Sachs system, which he created with Erich von Hornbostel.

==Biography==
Born in Berlin, Sachs studied piano, music theory and composition as a youth in that city. However, his doctorate from Berlin University (where he was later professor of musicology) in 1904 was on the history of art, with his thesis on the sculpture of Verrocchio. He began a career as an art historian, but promptly became more devoted to music, eventually being appointed director of the Staatliche Instrumentensammlung, a large collection of musical instruments. He reorganised and restored much of the collection, and his career as an organologist began.

In 1913, Sachs saw the publication of his book &quot;Real-Lexicon der Musikinstrumente&quot;, probably the most comprehensive survey of musical instruments in 200 years. The following year, he and Erich Moritz von Hornbostel published the work for which they are probably now best known in &quot;Zeitschrift für Ethnologie&quot;, a new system of musical instrument classification. It is today known as the Sachs-Hornbostel system. It has been much revised over the years, and has been the subject of some criticism, but it remains the most widely used system of classification by ethnomusicologists and organologists.

In 1933, the Nazis came to power. Sachs was dismissed from his posts in Germany by the Nazi Party because he was a Jew. Sachs moved to Paris, later to the United States, where he settled in New York City. From 1937 to 1953 he taught at New York University, and also worked at the New York Public Library. In 1953, he was appointed adjunct professor at Columbia University, a post he held until his death in 1959. He was a member of the American Musicological Society and served as president from 1948 to 1950.

His numerous books include works on rhythm, dance and musical instruments, with his &quot;The History of Musical Instruments&quot; (1940), a comprehensive survey of musical instruments worldwide throughout history, seen as one of the most important. The long relationship he had with W. W. Norton &amp; Company began with &quot;The Rise of Music in the Ancient World&quot; (1943). Although these works have been superseded by more recent research in some respects, they are still seen as essential texts in the field.

Sachs died in 1959 in New York City. In honor of Sachs&#x27; legacy, the American Musical Instrument Society established the Curt Sachs Award in 1983, which it gives each year to an individual who has made significant contributions to field of organology.

<text>The  (, &quot;Washhouse Boat&quot;) is the nickname of a building in the Montmartre district of the 18th arrondissement of Paris that is famous in art history as the residence and meeting place for a group of outstanding early 20th-century artists such as Pablo Picasso, men of letters, theatre people, and art dealers. It is located at No. 13 Rue Ravignan at Place Emile Goudeau, just below the Place du Tertre.

A fire destroyed most of the building in May 1970 and only the façade remained, but it was completely rebuilt in 1978.

==History==

Formerly a ballroom and piano factory, Bateau Lavoir was squatted and divided into 20 small workshops in 1889. Distributed along a corridor were small unheated rooms that shared a single source of water. The name &quot;&quot; was coined by French poet Max Jacob. The building was dark and dirty, almost seeming to be a scrap pile rather than a dwelling. On stormy days, it swayed and creaked, reminding people of washing-boats on the Seine River, hence the name.

The building stands on a small cobblestone square that was known as Place Ravignan. In 1911, it was rechristened Place Émile Goudeau for Émile Goudeau (1849–1906), a popular novelist, poet, and journalist who founded Les Hydropathes, a renowned and famous literary club. The square now has a Wallace fountain and is planted with horse chestnut trees.

Maxime Maufra (1863–1918) was the first noted artist to take up residence in Bateau-Lavoir, around 1890. Kees van Dongen and Pablo Picasso took up residence between 1900 and 1904. After 1904 more artists and writers moved in, including Otto van Rees, Amedeo Modigliani, Pierre Mac Orlan, Juan Gris, André Salmon, Pablo Gargallo, Max Jacob, Luigi Corbellini, and Pierre Reverdy.

It became an unofficial club that included artists Henri Matisse, Georges Braque, André Derain, Raoul Dufy, Marie Laurencin, Amedeo Modigliani, Jean-Paul Laurens, Maurice Utrillo, Jacques Lipchitz, María Blanchard, Jean Metzinger and Louis Marcoussis; writers Guillaume Apollinaire, Alfred Jarry, Jean Cocteau, Gustave Coquiot, Cremnitz (Maurice Chevrier), Paul Fort, André Warnod, Raymond Radiguet, and Gertrude Stein; actors Charles Dullin, Harry Baur, and Gaston Modot; and art dealers Ambroise Vollard, Clovis Sagot, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, and Berthe Weill.

While residing at the Bateau-Lavoir, Picasso painted works such as &quot;Young Girl with a Flower Basket&quot;, and &quot;Garçon à la pipe&quot; (&quot;Boy with a Pipe&quot;) in 1905, and one of his most noted works, &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot; in 1907, considered by art historians as a proto-Cubist painting (the precursor of a movement that became known as Cubism).

Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, creative artists living at the Bateau-Lavoir and in the neighbourhood began moving elsewhere, mainly to Montparnasse.

<text>A string quintet is a musical composition for five string players. As an extension to the string quartet (two violins, a viola, and a cello), a string quintet includes a fifth string instrument, usually a second viola (a so-called &quot;viola quintet&quot;) or a second cello (a &quot;cello quintet&quot;), or occasionally a double bass.

Notable examples of classic &quot;viola quintets&quot;, in four movement form include those of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Other examples were written by composers including Johannes Brahms and Felix Mendelssohn.

A famous &quot;cello quintet&quot; is Franz Schubert&#x27;s Quintet in C major. Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s Quintet Op. 77 uses a double bass, and Mozart&#x27;s famous &quot;Eine kleine Nachtmusik&quot; may be performed with this instrumentation (the double bass being optional).

Alternative additions include clarinet or piano (see clarinet quintet, piano quintet); and other closely related chamber music genres include the string quartet (much more common), the string trio, and the string sextet. A more unusual form of string quintet is the &quot;violin quintet&quot; composed of 3 violins, a viola and a cello (thus a string quartet with an additional violin).

The term &quot;string quintet&quot; may refer to a group of five players that performs such works. The ensemble was standard in 17th century Italy and can be seen as early as 1607 in Claudio Monteverdi&#x27;s opera, &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;.

<doc id="102298" wikidata="Q150747" url="?curid=102298" title="Wilhelmina of the Netherlands">
<text>Wilhelmina (; Wilhelmina Helena Pauline Maria; 31 August 1880 – 28 November 1962) was Queen of the Netherlands from 1890 until her abdication in 1948. She reigned for nearly 58 years, making her the longest-reigning monarch in Dutch history, as well as the longest-reigning female monarch outside the United Kingdom. Her reign saw World War I, the Dutch economic crisis of 1933 and World War II.

The only surviving child of King William III of the Netherlands and Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, Wilhelmina ascended the throne at the age of 10 after her father&#x27;s death in 1890, under her mother&#x27;s regency. After taking charge of government, Wilhelmina became generally popular for maintaining Dutch neutrality during the First World War and solving many of her country&#x27;s industrial problems. By that time, her business ventures had made her the world&#x27;s first female billionaire as measured by U.S. dollars.

Following the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1940, Wilhelmina fled to Britain and took charge of the Dutch government-in-exile. She frequently spoke to the nation over radio and came to be regarded as a symbol of the Dutch resistance. By 1948, she had returned to the liberated Netherlands and was the only survivor of the 17 European monarchs who were sitting on their thrones at the time of her inauguration. Increasingly beset by poor health, Wilhelmina abdicated in favour of her daughter Juliana in September 1948 and retired to Het Loo Palace, where she died in 1962.

Largely due to her status as a symbol of the Resistance, she remains reasonably popular in the Netherlands, even among the Dutch Republican movement.

==Youth==
Wilhelmina Helena Pauline Maria of Orange-Nassau was born on 31 August 1880, in Noordeinde Palace, The Hague, Netherlands. She was the only child of King William III and Queen Emma. Her childhood was characterised by a close relationship with her parents, especially with her father, who was 63 years old when she was born. In her memoir, &quot;Lonely But Not Alone&quot;, Wilhelmina wrote that she recalled her father riding horses.

Under the Semi-Salic system of inheritance that was in place in the Netherlands until 1887, Wilhelmina was third in line to the throne from birth. Her father had had three sons with his first wife, Sophie of Württemberg, but two of them had died before Wilhelmina&#x27;s birth. The only other surviving male relatives from the House of Orange were Wilhelmina&#x27;s great-uncle Frederick, who died in 1881 when Wilhelmina was one year old, and her half-brother Alexander, who died before she turned four. By 1887, the 70-year-old King finally abandoned the &#x27;hope of a son&#x27; with his young wife and made the pragmatic decision to settle the throne upon his only surviving child.
King William III died on 23 November 1890 and 10-year-old Wilhelmina became Queen of the Netherlands, though her mother was named regent. In 1895, Wilhelmina visited Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, who penned an evaluation in her diary: &quot;The young Queen ... still has her hair hanging loose. She is very slight &amp; graceful, has fine features, &amp; seems to be very intelligent &amp; a charming child. She speaks English extremely well &amp; has very pretty manners.&quot;

On 6 September 1898, Wilhelmina was sworn-in at the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam. She was well aware what was expected by the elected representatives, but was a strong-willed, forceful woman who spoke and acted her mind. She &quot;hated&quot; politicians and instead stated a love for the people. Reflecting popular opinion in the Netherlands at the time, Wilhelmina expressed a level of disdain towards the British for their annexations of the Transvaal Republic and the Orange Free State in the Boer War. The Boers were descended from Dutch colonists who migrated to the region while it was a Dutch colony, and the Dutch people, Wilhelmina included, felt a close level of affinity towards them. In one conversation with her former governess, the Briton Elisabeth Saxton Winter, Wilhelmina referred to the Boer commandos as &quot;excellent shots.&quot; During the war, Wilhelmina ordered the Dutch cruiser HNLMS &quot;Gelderland&quot; to Portuguese East Africa to evacuate Paul Kruger, the president of the South African Republic.

==Marriage==

On 7 February 1901 in The Hague, Queen Wilhelmina married Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Although she was devoted to her spouse at the time of their wedding, it proved in the long run to be an unhappy marriage that did little more than meet its obligation by producing an heir. Prince Henry was known to have had numerous extra-marital affairs, at least one of which resulted in illegitimate offspring. On 9 November, nine months after her marriage, Wilhelmina suffered a miscarriage. On 4 May 1902, she gave birth to a premature stillborn son. This may have been an abortion, needed to save her life after a typhoid infection. Her next pregnancy ended in another miscarriage on 23 July 1906. During this time Wilhelmina&#x27;s heir presumptive was her first cousin once removed William Ernest, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. Next in line was her cousin Marie Alexandrine of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.

As it was assumed that the former would renounce his claim to the Dutch throne and that the latter was too elderly to become queen, Marie Alexandrine&#x27;s eldest son, German Prince Heinrich XXXII Reuss of Köstritz, stood in line to succeed Wilhelmina if she had no surviving children. Prince Heinrich had close associations with the German Imperial family and military, so there were fears that were the Queen to remain childless, the Dutch Crown &quot;was bound to pass into the possession of a German prince, whose birth, training, and affiliations would naturally have led him to bring Holland [sic] within the sphere of the German Empire, at the expense of its independence, both national and economic&quot;, according to one contemporary publication. The birth of Princess Juliana, on 30 April 1909, was met with great relief after eight years of her childless marriage. Wilhelmina, who formed a close relationship with her daughter, suffered two further miscarriages on 23 January and 20 October 1912.

==World War I==
Before the First World War began, Wilhelmina visited the powerful German Emperor Wilhelm II. The emperor thought he could impress the ruler of a relatively small country by telling her, &quot;My guards are seven feet tall and yours are only shoulder-high to them.&quot; The queen smiled politely and replied, &quot;Quite true, Your Majesty, your guards are seven feet tall. But when we open our dikes, the water is ten feet deep!&quot; She was very wary of a German attack, especially in the beginning. Partly due to her political influence, the Netherlands remained neutral during World War I. However, the Allies included the Netherlands in their blockade of Germany, intercepting all Dutch ships and severely restricting Dutch imports to ensure that goods could not be passed on to Germany. Furthermore, the Russian Revolution by the Bolsheviks in 1917 cost the queen almost 20% of her financial assets.

Being a woman, Wilhelmina could not be the supreme commander , but still used every opportunity she had to inspect the Crown forces. She appeared without prior notice on many occasions to see reality instead of a prepared show. She wanted a small but well-trained and equipped army and was very unhappy with most of her governments, which were always eager to cut the military budget. On 6 September 1916 Wilhelmina was aboard the Dutch submarine &quot;O 3&quot; while it performed underwater exercises. This made Wilhemina the second head of state, after the American president Theodore Roosevelt who was the first, to sail and dive aboard a submarine. She was also the first woman to go underwater aboard a submarine. In June 1917, Wilhelmina returned from a two-day visit to Zaltbommel on the train that derailed at Houten, but remained unharmed and helped to take care of the injured.

Civil unrest gripped the Netherlands after the war, spurred by the end of the Russian Empire. Instead of a violent revolution, Socialist leader Pieter Jelles Troelstra wanted to abolish the existing government and the monarchy by winning control of Parliament in an election with the support of the working class. However, Wilhelmina&#x27;s popularity helped restore confidence in the government. She brought about a mass show of support by riding alongside her daughter through the crowds in an open carriage.

At the end of World War I, Kaiser Wilhelm fled to the Netherlands, where he was granted political asylum, partly owing to his familial links with the royal family. In response to Allied efforts to get their hands on the deposed Kaiser, Wilhelmina called the Allies&#x27; ambassadors to her presence and lectured them on the rights of asylum.

==Interwar period==

Wilhelmina had a keen understanding of business matters. She used her personal wealth inherited from her family to make several investments in the United States, which eventually made her the world&#x27;s richest woman and first female billionaire in dollars. During the 1920s and 1930s, the Netherlands began to emerge as an industrial power with the help of the Queen&#x27;s funds. Engineers reclaimed vast amounts of land that had been under water by building the Zuiderzee Works, the largest hydraulic engineering project undertaken by the Netherlands during the 20th century. Its main purposes were to improve flood protection and create additional land for agriculture.

In 1939, the government proposed a refugee camp near the city of Apeldoorn for German Jews fleeing the Nazi regime. However, Wilhelmina intervened because she felt the planned location was &quot;too close&quot; to the royal family&#x27;s summer residence. Indeed if spies were to be among the fugitives, they would be within walking distance of Het Loo Palace. After long discussions, the camp was finally erected about 10 km from the village of Westerbork.

Aside from economical and security matters, Queen Wilhelmina used most of the 1930s to find a suitable husband for Juliana. This was a difficult task since she was very religious and insisted that her daughter&#x27;s husband would be a Protestant of royal birth. Many prospects from the United Kingdom and Sweden either declined or were turned down by Juliana. Finally, mother and daughter found a suitable match in German Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld. Wilhelmina had her lawyers draft a very detailed prenuptial agreement that specified exactly what her future son-in-law could and could not do.

==World War II==

On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded the Netherlands. Despite her hostility towards the British, the almost sixty-year-old Queen Wilhelmina and her family fled The Hague and boarded HMS &quot;Hereward&quot;, a British destroyer sent by King George VI to take them across the North Sea. There is an ongoing debate about the royal family&#x27;s departure. Some say that an evacuation to the United Kingdom had been planned some time in advance, since at least the end of 1939. Others say the queen boarded the destroyer with the intent of going to the Dutch province of Zeeland, which had not yet been conquered. However, along the journey, it became clear that due to advancing German forces, Zeeland was not safe either, forcing the destroyer to sail for the United Kingdom. In any case, she arrived in the United Kingdom on 13 May, planning to return to the Netherlands as soon as possible. The Dutch armed forces in the Netherlands, apart from those in Zeeland, surrendered on 15 May.

In Britain, Queen Wilhelmina took charge of the Dutch government in exile, setting up a chain of command and immediately communicating a message to her people. Relations between the new Dutch government and the queen were tense, with mutual dislike growing as the war progressed. She went on to be the most prominent figure, owing to her experience and knowledge, which earned her respect and support among the other leaders of the world. On the other hand, the new Dutch government did not have a parliament to back them and had few employees to assist them. The Dutch prime minister, Dirk Jan de Geer, believed the Allies would not win and intended to open negotiations with Germany for a separate peace. Therefore, Wilhelmina sought to remove De Geer from power. With the aid of minister Pieter Gerbrandy, she succeeded.

During the war, Queen Wilhelmina&#x27;s photograph was a sign of resistance against the Germans. Like Winston Churchill, Wilhelmina broadcast messages to the Dutch people over Radio Oranje. She called Adolf Hitler &quot;the arch-enemy of mankind&quot;. Her late-night broadcasts were eagerly awaited by her people, who had to hide to listen to them illegally. An anecdote published in her &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary illustrates how she was valued by her subjects during this period:


Queen Wilhelmina visited the United States from 24 June to 11 August 1942 as a guest of the U.S. government. She vacationed in Lee, Massachusetts, and visited New York City, Boston, and Albany, New York. In the latter city, she attended the 300th anniversary celebration of the First Church in Albany, established by Dutch settlers in the 17th century. She addressed the U.S. Congress on 5 August 1942 and was the first queen to do so. Shortly afterwards, Wilhelmina went to Canada in 1943 to attend the christening of her new granddaughter Margriet on 29 June 1943 in Ottawa and stayed a while with her family before returning to the United Kingdom.

During Operation Steinbock, Queen Wilhelmina was almost killed by a bomb that took the lives of several of her guards and severely damaged her residence near South Mimms in England. In 1944, Wilhelmina became the first woman since the 15th century, other than queens of the United Kingdom, to be inducted into the Order of the Garter. Churchill described her as &quot;the only real man among the governments-in-exile&quot; in London.

In England, Queen Wilhelmina developed ideas about a new political and social life for the Dutch after the liberation, wanting to create a strong cabinet formed by people active in the resistance. She dismissed De Geer and installed a new prime minister with the approval of other Dutch politicians. When the Netherlands was liberated in 1945, the queen was disappointed to see the same political factions taking power as before the war. In mid-March 1945, she travelled to the liberated areas of the southern Netherlands, visiting the region of Walcheren and the city of Eindhoven where she received a rapturous welcome from the local population. On 2 May 1945, she went to stay in a small country estate called Anneville located just south of Breda with Juliana and adjuncts Peter Tazelaar, Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema and fellow Engelandvaarder Rie Stokvis. Anneville was the scene of a number of processions where the residents of Breda and the surrounding communities came to greet their Queen. She remained there for a little over six weeks.

Shortly after the war, Queen Wilhelmina wanted to give an award to the Polish Parachute Brigade for their actions during Operation Market Garden and wrote the government a request. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Eelco van Kleffens, opposed the idea because he thought an award for the Poles would upset relations with the &#x27;Big Three&#x27; and harm national interests. Eventually the Polish Parachute Brigade were awarded the Military Order of William on 31 May 2006, 61 years after Operation Market Garden.

==Later years==

Following the end of World War II, Queen Wilhelmina made the decision not to return to her palace but to move into a mansion in The Hague, where she lived for eight months. She travelled through the countryside to motivate people, sometimes using a bicycle instead of a car. However, in 1947, while the country was still recovering, the nationalist rebellion in the oil-rich Dutch East Indies saw the sharp criticism of the queen by the Dutch economic elite.

Around the same time, Queen Wilhelmina&#x27;s health started failing, forcing her to cede her monarchial duties to Princess Juliana temporarily towards the end of 1947 (14 October – 1 December). She considered abdication, but her daughter pressed her to stay on for the stability of the nation. Wilhelmina had every intention of doing so, but exhaustion forced her to relinquish monarchial duties to Juliana again on 12 May 1948, which left the princess to deal with the early elections caused by the ceding of the Indonesian colonies.

Dismayed by the return to pre-war politics and the pending loss of Indonesia, Wilhelmina abdicated on 4 September 1948 after a reign of 57 years and 286 days due to advancing age and illness. She passed the crown to Juliana and was hence forward styled &quot;Her Royal Highness Princess Wilhelmina of the Netherlands&quot;. Since then, the influence of the Dutch monarchy continued to decline but the country&#x27;s love for its royal family continued.

No longer queen, Wilhelmina retreated to Het Loo Palace, making few public appearances until the country was devastated by the North Sea flood of 1953. Once again, she travelled around the country to encourage and motivate the Dutch people. During her last years, she wrote her autobiography, entitled &quot;Eenzaam, maar niet alleen&quot; (&quot;Lonely but Not Alone&quot;), in which she gave her account of the events in her life and revealed her strong religious feelings.

Wilhelmina died of cardiac arrest in Het Loo Palace at the age of 82 on 28 November 1962. She was buried in the Dutch royal family crypt in the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft, on 8 December. At her request and contrary to protocol, the funeral was completely in white to give expression to her belief that earthly death was the beginning of eternal life.

In addition to being the last male-line descendant of the House of Orange-Nassau, she was also the last great-grandchild of Emperor Paul I of Russia.

==In popular culture==
* Queen Wilhelmina appears in two videogames: as the leader in &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization VI&quot; in the &quot;Rise and Fall&quot; expansion, and as leader of the Netherlands in &quot;Hearts of Iron IV&quot;.
* She was portrayed by Andrea Domburg in Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s 1977 film &quot;Soldier of Orange&quot;.

==Titles, styles and honours==
===Titles and styles===

* 31 August 1880 – 21 June 1884: &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; Princess Pauline of Orange-Nassau
* 21 June 1884 – 23 November 1890: &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; Princess Wilhelmina of Orange-Nassau
* 23 November 1890 – 4 September 1948: &quot;Her Majesty&quot; Queen Wilhelmina, Queen of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau
* 4 September 1948 – 28 November 1962: &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; Princess Wilhelmina of the Netherlands

Wilhelmina&#x27;s full regnal title from her accession to her marriage was: &quot;Wilhelmina, &quot;by the Grace of God, Queen of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, Duchess of Limburg, etc.&quot;&quot; She adopted her husband&#x27;s ducal title upon marriage as customary, becoming also a duchess of Mecklenburg.

===Honours===
* Netherlands:
** Grand Master of the Military William Order, &quot;1890&quot;; Grand Cross, &quot;4 September 1948&quot;
** Grand Master of the Order of the Netherlands Lion, &quot;1890&quot;
** Grand Master of the Order of Orange-Nassau, &quot;1890&quot;
** Joint Grand Master of the Order of the Gold Lion of Nassau, &quot;1890&quot;
** Grand Master of the Order of the House of Orange, &quot;1890&quot;
** Founder of the Johanniter Order, &quot;1909&quot;

Since Wilhelmina received no Dutch honours before ascending the throne aged ten and resigned the position of grand master when she abdicated in 1948, she was in the unusual position of being a Dutch princess and former queen who did not hold a Dutch honour. Her daughter and successor therefore appointed her Grand Cross of the Military William Order in her first act as Queen. This was the only Dutch honour she ever held in her life in a personal capacity.

====Foreign====

===Eponyms===
* Queen Wilhelmina State Park in Arkansas, and Wilhelmina Bay in Antarctica are named for Queen Wilhelmina.
* In 1892, the company Fortuin celebrated its 50th anniversary by producing peppermint candy with the image of the 12-year-old Princess Wilhelmina, which have continued in production since then. Among Dutch sweets, these mints have become the &quot;most Dutch of all&quot;.

==Ancestry==
After Wilhelmina had taken office in 1890, rumours were spread by Socialist satirical magazine &quot;De Roode Duivel&quot; (&quot;The Red Devil&quot;) that William III was not her real father, but Emma&#x27;s confidant, . This would undermine the legitimacy of the Queen&#x27;s reign. Although no hard evidence exists for the allegations and the consensus amongst historians is that they are false, the rumours were stubborn and still feature in conspiracy theories circulating in republican circles. The author of the rumour, the later parliamentarian and senator , was sentenced to six months imprisonment for lèse-majesté in 1895 for a different article and cartoon in &quot;De Roode Duivel&quot;, mocking the two queens.

<text>Thomas Cowperthwait Eakins (; July 25, 1844 – June 25, 1916) was an American realist painter, photographer, sculptor, and fine arts educator. He is widely acknowledged to be one of the most important American artists.

For the length of his professional career, from the early 1870s until his health began to fail some 40 years later, Eakins worked exactingly from life, choosing as his subject the people of his hometown of Philadelphia. He painted several hundred portraits, usually of friends, family members, or prominent people in the arts, sciences, medicine, and clergy. Taken &quot;en masse&quot;, the portraits offer an overview of the intellectual life of contemporary Philadelphia of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In addition, Eakins produced a number of large paintings that brought the portrait out of the drawing room and into the offices, streets, parks, rivers, arenas, and surgical amphitheaters of his city. These active outdoor venues allowed him to paint the subject that most inspired him: the nude or lightly clad figure in motion. In the process, he could model the forms of the body in full sunlight, and create images of deep space utilizing his studies in perspective. Eakins took keen interest in new motion photography, a field in which he is now seen as an innovator.

Eakins was also an educator, and his instruction was a highly influential presence in American art. The difficulties he encountered as an artist were seeking to paint portraits and figures realistically as behavioral and sexual scandals truncated his success and challenged his reputation.

Eakins was a controversial figure whose work received little recognition during his lifetime. Since his death, he has been celebrated by American art historians as &quot;the strongest, most profound realist in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century American art&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Eakins was born and lived most of his life in Philadelphia. He was the first child of Caroline Cowperthwait Eakins, a woman of English and Dutch descent, and Benjamin Eakins, a writing master and calligraphy teacher of Scottish and Irish ancestry. His father grew up on a farm in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, the son of a weaver. He was successful in his chosen profession, and moved to Philadelphia in the early 1840s, to raise his family. Thomas Eakins observed his father at work and by twelve demonstrated skill in precise line drawing, perspective, and the use of a grid to lay out a careful design, all skills he later applied to his art.

Eakins was an athletic child who enjoyed rowing, ice skating, swimming, wrestling, sailing, and gymnastics; he later used these as subjects in his painting and encouraged them in his students. Eakins attended Central High School in Philadelphia, the premier public school for applied science and arts in the city, where he excelled in mechanical drawing. Thomas met fellow artist and lifelong friend Charles Lewis Fussell in high school, and they reunited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where Thomas enrolled in 1861. At Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Eakins enrolled in courses in anatomy and dissection at Jefferson Medical College from 1864 to 1865. For a while, he followed his father&#x27;s profession and was listed in city directories as a writing teacher. His scientific interest in the human body led him to consider becoming a surgeon.

Eakins then studied art in Europe from 1866 to 1870, including with Jean-Léon Gérôme in Paris; he was only the second American pupil of the French realist painter, who was known as a master of Orientalism. Eakins also attended the atelier of Léon Bonnat, a realist painter who emphasized anatomical preciseness, a method adapted by Eakins. While studying at the , he seems to have taken scant interest in the new Impressionist movement, nor was he impressed by what he perceived as the classical pretensions of the French Academy. A letter home to his father in 1868 made his aesthetic clear:

She [the female nude] is the most beautiful thing there is in the world except a naked man, but I never yet saw a study of one exhibited... It would be a godsend to see a fine man model painted in the studio with the bare walls, alongside of the smiling smirking goddesses of waxy complexion amidst the delicious arsenic green trees and gentle wax flowers &amp; purling streams running melodious up &amp; down the hills especially up. I hate affectation.

Already at age 24, &quot;nudity and verity were linked with an unusual closeness in his mind.&quot; Yet his desire for truthfulness was more expansive, and the letters home to Philadelphia reveal a passion for realism that included, but was not limited to, the study of the figure.

A trip to Spain for six months confirmed his admiration for the realism of artists such as Diego Velázquez and Jusepe de Ribera. In Seville in 1869, he painted &quot;Carmelita Requeña&quot; (image link), a portrait of a seven-year-old Romani dancer more freely and colorfully painted than his Paris studies. That same year he attempted his first large oil painting, &quot;A Street Scene in Seville&quot; (image link), wherein he first dealt with the complications of a scene observed outside the studio. Although he failed to matriculate in a formal degree program and had shown no works in the European salons, Eakins succeeded in absorbing the techniques and methods of French and Spanish masters, and he began to formulate his artistic vision which he demonstrated in his first major painting upon his return to America. &quot;I shall seek to achieve my broad effect from the very beginning&quot;, he declared.

==Career==

Eakins&#x27; first works upon his return from Europe included a large group of rowing scenes, eleven oils and watercolors in all, of which the first and most famous is &quot;Max Schmitt in a Single Scull&quot; (1871; also known as &quot;The Champion Single Sculling&quot;). Both his subject and his technique drew attention. His selection of a contemporary sport was &quot;a shock to the artistic conventionalities of the city&quot;. Eakins placed himself in the painting, in a scull behind Schmitt, his name inscribed on the boat.

Typically, the work entailed critical observation of the painting&#x27;s subject, and preparatory drawings of the figure and perspective plans of the scull in the water. Its preparation and composition indicates the importance of Eakins&#x27; academic training in Paris. It was a completely original conception, true to Eakins&#x27; firsthand experience, and an almost startlingly successful image for the artist, who had struggled with his first outdoor composition less than a year before. His first known sale was the watercolor &quot;The Sculler&quot; (1874). Most critics judged the rowing pictures successful and auspicious, but after the initial flourish, Eakins never revisited the subject of rowing and went on to other sports themes.

At the same time that he made these initial ventures into outdoor themes, Eakins produced a series of domestic Victorian interiors, often with his father, his sisters or friends as the subjects. &quot;Home Scene&quot; (1871; image link), &quot;Elizabeth at the Piano&quot; (1875; image link), &quot;The Chess Players&quot; (1876), and &quot;Elizabeth Crowell and her Dog&quot; (1874; image link), each dark in tonality, focus on the unsentimental characterization of individuals adopting natural attitudes in their homes.

It was in this vein that in 1872 he painted his first large scale portrait, &quot;Kathrin&quot; (image link), in which the subject, Kathrin Crowell, is seen in dim light, playing with a kitten. In 1874, Eakins and Crowell became engaged; they were still engaged five years later, when Crowell died of meningitis in 1879.

===Teaching and forced resignation===
Eakins returned to the Pennsylvania Academy to teach in 1876 as a volunteer after the opening of the school&#x27;s new Frank Furness designed building. He became a salaried professor in 1878, and rose to director in 1882. His teaching methods were controversial: there was no drawing from antique casts, and students received only a short study in charcoal, followed quickly by their introduction to painting, in order to grasp subjects in true color as soon as practical. He encouraged students to use photography as an aid to understanding anatomy and the study of motion, and disallowed prize competitions. Although there was no specialized vocational instruction, students with aspirations for using their school training for applied arts, such as illustration, lithography, and decoration, were as welcome as students interested in becoming portrait artists.

Most notable was his interest in the instruction of all aspects of the human figure, including anatomical study of the human and animal body, and surgical dissection; there were also rigorous courses in the fundamentals of form, and studies in perspective which involved mathematics. As an aid to the study of anatomy, plaster casts were made from dissections, duplicates of which were furnished to students. A similar study was made of the anatomy of horses; acknowledging Eakins&#x27; expertise, in 1891 his friend, the sculptor William Rudolf O&#x27;Donovan, asked him to collaborate on the commission to create bronze equestrian reliefs of Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant, for the Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Arch in Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn.

Owing to Eakins&#x27; devotion to working from life, the academy&#x27;s course of study was by the early 1880s the most &quot;liberal and advanced in the world&quot;. Eakins believed in teaching by example and letting the students find their own way with only terse guidance. His students included painters, cartoonists, and illustrators such as Henry Ossawa Tanner, Thomas Pollock Anshutz, Edward Willis Redfield, Colin Campbell Cooper, Alice Barber Stephens, Frederick Judd Waugh, T. S. Sullivant and A. B. Frost.

He stated his teaching philosophy bluntly, &quot;A teacher can do very little for a pupil &amp; should only be thankful if he don&#x27;t hinder him ... and the greater the master, mostly the less he can say.&quot; He believed that women should &quot;assume professional privileges&quot; as would men. Life classes and dissection were segregated but women had access to male models (who were nude but wore loincloths).

The line between impartiality and questionable behavior was a fine one. When a female student, Amelia Van Buren, asked about the movement of the pelvis, Eakins invited her to his studio, where he undressed and &quot;gave her the explanation as I could not have done by words only&quot;. Such incidents, coupled with the ambitions of his younger associates to oust him and take over the school themselves, created tensions between him and the academy&#x27;s board of directors. He was ultimately forced to resign in 1886, for removing the loincloth of a male model in a class where female students were present.

The forced resignation was a major setback for Eakins. His family was split, with his in-laws siding against him in public dispute. He struggled to protect his name against rumors and false charges, had bouts of ill health, and suffered a humiliation which he felt for the rest of his life. A drawing manual he had written and prepared illustrations for remained unfinished and unpublished during his lifetime. Eakins&#x27; popularity among the students was such that a number of them broke with the academy and formed the Art Students&#x27; League of Philadelphia (1886–1893), where Eakins subsequently instructed. It was there that he met the student Samuel Murray, who would become his protege and lifelong friend. He also lectured and taught at a number of other schools, including the Art Students League of New York, the National Academy of Design, Cooper Union, and the Art Students&#x27; Guild in Washington DC. Dismissed in March 1895 by the Drexel Institute in Philadelphia for again using a fully nude male model, he gradually withdrew from teaching by 1898.

===Photography===

Eakins has been credited with having &quot;introduced the camera to the American art studio&quot;. During his study abroad, he was exposed to the use of photography by the French realists, though the use of photography was still frowned upon as a shortcut by traditionalists.

In the late 1870s, Eakins was introduced to the photographic motion studies of Eadweard Muybridge, particularly the equine studies, and became interested in using the camera to study sequential movement. In 1883, Muybridge gave a lecture at the academy, arranged by Eakins and University of Pennsylvania (Penn) trustee Fairman Rogers. A group of Philadelphians, including Penn Provost William Pepper and the publisher J. B. Lippincott recruited Muybridge to work at Penn under their sponsorship. In 1884, Eakins worked briefly alongside Muybridge in the latter&#x27;s photographic studio at the northeast corner of 36th and Pine streets in Philadelphia.

Eakins soon performed his own independent motion studies, also usually involving the nude figure, and even developed his own technique for capturing movement on film. Whereas Muybridge&#x27;s system relied on a series of cameras triggered to produce a sequence of individual photographs, Eakins preferred to use a single camera to produce a series of exposures superimposed on one negative. Eakins was more interested in precision measurements on a single image to aid in translating a motion into a painting, while Muybridge preferred separate images that could also be displayed by his primitive movie projector.

After Eakins obtained a camera in 1880, several paintings, such as &quot;Mending the Net&quot; (1881; image link) and &quot;Arcadia&quot; (1883; image link), are known to have been derived at least in part from his photographs. Some figures appear to be detailed transcriptions and tracings from the photographs by some device like a magic lantern, which Eakins then took pains to cover up with oil paint. Eakins&#x27; methods appear to be meticulously applied, and rather than shortcuts, were likely used in a quest for accuracy and realism.

An excellent example of Eakins&#x27; use of this new technology is his painting &quot;A May Morning in the Park&quot;, which relied heavily on photographic motion studies to depict the true gait of the four horses pulling the coach of patron Rogers. But in typical fashion, Eakins also employed wax figures and oil sketches to get the final effect he desired.

The so-called &quot;Naked Series&quot;, which began in 1883, were nude photos of students and professional models which were taken to show real human anatomy from several specific angles, and were often hung and displayed for study at the school. Later, less regimented poses were taken indoors and out, of men, women, and children, including his wife. The most provocative, and the only ones combining males and females, were nude photos of Eakins and a female model (see below). Although witnesses and chaperones were usually on site, and the poses were mostly traditional in nature, the sheer quantity of the photos and Eakins&#x27; overt display of them may have undermined his standing at the academy. In all, about eight hundred photographs are now attributed to Eakins and his circle, most of which are figure studies, both clothed and nude, and portraits. No other American artist of his time matched Eakins&#x27; interest in photography, nor produced a comparable body of photographic works.

Eakins used photography for his own private ends as well. Aside from nude men, and women, he also photographed nude children. While the photographs of the nude adults are more artistically composed, the younger children and infants are posed less formally. These photographs, that are &quot;charged with sexual overtones&quot;, as Susan Danly and Cheryl Leibold write, are of unidentified children. In the catalog of Eakins&#x27; collection at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, photograph number 308 is of an African American child reclining on a couch and posed as Venus. Both Saidiya Hartman and Fred Moten write, respectively, about the photograph, and the child that it arrests.

===Portraits===


According to one reviewer in 1876: &quot;This portrait of Dr. Gross is a great work—we know of nothing greater that has ever been executed in America&quot;.

I will never have to give up painting, for even now I could paint heads good enough to make a living anywhere in America.

For Eakins, portraiture held little interest as a means of fashionable idealization or even simple verisimilitude. Instead, it provided the opportunity to reveal the character of an individual through the modeling of solid anatomical form. This meant that, notwithstanding his youthful optimism, Eakins would never be a commercially successful portrait painter, as few paid commissions came his way. But his total output of some two hundred and fifty portraits is characterized by &quot;an uncompromising search for the unique human being&quot;.

Often this search for individuality required that the subject be painted in his own daily working environment. Eakins&#x27; &quot;Portrait of Professor Benjamin H. Rand&quot; (1874) was a prelude to what many consider his most important work.

In &quot;The Gross Clinic&quot; (1875), a renowned Philadelphia surgeon, Dr. Samuel D. Gross, is seen presiding over an operation to remove part of a diseased bone from a patient&#x27;s thigh. Gross lectures in an amphitheater crowded with students at Jefferson Medical College. Eakins spent nearly a year on the painting, again choosing a novel subject, the discipline of modern surgery, in which Philadelphia was in the forefront. He initiated the project and may have had the goal of a grand work befitting a showing at the Centennial Exposition of 1876. Though rejected for the Art Gallery, the painting was shown on the centennial grounds at an exhibit of a U.S. Army Post Hospital. In sharp contrast, another Eakins submission, &quot;The Chess Players&quot;, was accepted by the committee and was much admired at the Centennial Exhibition, and critically praised.

At 96 by 78 inches (240 × 200 cm), &quot;The Gross Clinic&quot; is one of the artist&#x27;s largest works, and considered by some to be his greatest. Eakins&#x27; high expectations at the start of the project were recorded in a letter, &quot;What elates me more is that I have just got a new picture blocked in and it is very far better than anything I have ever done. As I spoil things less and less in finishing I have the greatest hopes of this one&quot; But if Eakins hoped to impress his home town with the picture, he was to be disappointed; public reaction to the painting of a realistic surgical incision and the resultant blood was ambivalent at best, and it was finally purchased by the college for the unimpressive sum of $200. Eakins borrowed it for subsequent exhibitions, where it drew strong reactions, such as that of the &quot;New York Daily Tribune&quot;, which both acknowledged and damned its powerful image, &quot;but the more one praises it, the more one must condemn its admission to a gallery where men and women of weak nerves must be compelled to look at it. For not to look it is impossible...No purpose is gained by this morbid exhibition, no lesson taught—the painter shows his skill and the spectators&#x27; gorge rises at it—that is all.&quot; The college now describes it thus: &quot;Today the once maligned picture is celebrated as a great nineteenth-century medical history painting, featuring one of the most superb portraits in American art&quot;.

In 1876, Eakins completed a portrait of Dr. John Brinton, surgeon of the Philadelphia Hospital, and famed for his Civil War service. Done in a more informal setting than &quot;The Gross Clinic&quot;, it was a personal favorite of Eakins, and &quot;The Art Journal&quot; proclaimed &quot;it is in every respect a more favorable example of this artist&#x27;s abilities than his much-talked-of composition representing a dissecting room.&quot;

Other outstanding examples of his portraits include &quot;The Agnew Clinic&quot; (1889), Eakins&#x27; most important commission and largest painting, which depicted another eminent American surgeon, Dr. David Hayes Agnew, performing a mastectomy; &quot;The Dean&#x27;s Roll Call&quot; (1899; image link), featuring Dr. James W. Holland, and &quot;Professor Leslie W. Miller&quot; (1901; image link), portraits of educators standing as if addressing an audience; a portrait of Frank Hamilton Cushing (c. 1895), in which the prominent ethnologist is seen performing an incantation at the Zuñi pueblo; &quot;Professor Henry A. Rowland&quot; (1897; image link), a brilliant scientist whose study of spectroscopy revolutionized his field; &quot;Antiquated Music&quot; (1900), in which Mrs. William D. Frishmuth is shown seated amidst her collection of musical instruments; and &quot;The Concert Singer&quot; (1890–1892), for which Eakins asked Weda Cook to sing &quot;O rest in the Lord&quot;, so that he could study the muscles of her throat and mouth. To replicate the proper deployment of a baton, Eakins enlisted an orchestral conductor to pose for the hand seen in the lower left-hand corner of the painting.

Of Eakins&#x27; later portraits, many took as their subjects women who were friends or students. Unlike most portrayals of women at the time, they are devoid of glamor and idealization. For &quot;Portrait of Letitia Wilson Jordan&quot; (1888; image link), Eakins painted the sitter wearing the same evening dress in which he had seen her at a party. She is a substantial presence, a vision quite different from the era&#x27;s fashionable portraiture. So, too, his &quot;Portrait of Maud Cook&quot; (1895), where the obvious beauty of the subject is noted with &quot;a stark objectivity&quot;.

The portrait of &quot;Miss Amelia Van Buren&quot; (c. 1890), a friend and former pupil, suggests the melancholy of a complex personality, and has been called &quot;the finest of all American portraits&quot;. Even Susan Macdowell Eakins, a strong painter and former student who married Eakins in 1884, was not sentimentalized: despite its richness of color, &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Wife and His Setter Dog&quot; (c. 1884–1889) is a penetratingly candid portrait.

Some of his most vivid portraits resulted from a late series done for the Catholic clergy, which included paintings of a cardinal, archbishops, bishops, and monsignors. As usual, most of the sitters were engaged at Eakins&#x27; request, and were given the portraits when Eakins had completed them. In portraits of &quot;His Eminence Sebastiano Cardinal Martinelli&quot; (1902; image link), &quot;Archbishop William Henry Elder&quot; (1903), and &quot;Monsignor James P. Turner&quot; (c. 1906; image link), Eakins took advantage of the brilliant vestments of the offices to animate the compositions in a way not possible in his other male portraits.

Deeply affected by his dismissal from the academy, Eakins focused his later career on portraiture, such as his 1905 &quot;Portrait of Professor William S. Forbes&quot;. His steadfast insistence on his own vision of realism, in addition to his notoriety from his school scandals, combined to hurt his income in later years. Even as he approached these portraits with the skill of a highly trained anatomist, what is most noteworthy is the intense psychological presence of his sitters. However, it was precisely for this reason that his portraits were often rejected by the sitters or their families. As a result, Eakins came to rely on his friends and family members to model for portraits. His portrait of Walt Whitman (1887–1888) was the poet&#x27;s favorite.

===The figure===
Eakins&#x27; lifelong interest in the figure, nude or nearly so, took several thematic forms. The rowing paintings of the early 1870s constitute the first series of figure studies. In Eakins&#x27; largest picture on the subject, &quot;The Biglin Brothers Turning the Stake&quot; (1873; image link), the muscular dynamism of the body is given its fullest treatment.

In the 1877 painting &quot;William Rush and His Model&quot;, he painted the female nude as integral to a historical subject, even though there is no evidence that the model who posed for Rush did so in the nude. The Centennial Exhibition of 1876 helped foster a revival in interest in Colonial America and Eakins participated with an ambitious project employing oil studies, wax and wood models, and finally the portrait in 1877. William Rush was a celebrated Colonial sculptor and ship carver, a revered example of an artist-citizen who figured prominently in Philadelphia civic life, and a founder of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where Eakins started teaching.

Despite his sincerely depicted reverence for Rush, Eakins&#x27; treatment of the human body once again drew criticism. This time it was the nude model and her heaped-up clothes depicted front and center, with Rush relegated to the deep shadows in the left background, that stirred dissatisfaction. Nonetheless, Eakins found a subject that referenced his native city and an earlier Philadelphia artist, and allowed for an assay on the female nude seen from behind.

When he returned to the subject many years later, the narrative became more personal: In &quot;William Rush and His Model&quot; (1908), gone are the chaperon and detailed interior of the earlier work. The professional distance between sculptor and model has been eliminated, and the relationship has become intimate. In one version of the painting from that year, the nude is seen from the front, being helped down from the model stand by an artist who bears a strong resemblance to Eakins.

&quot;The Swimming Hole&quot; (1884–85) features Eakins&#x27; finest studies of the nude, in his most successfully constructed outdoor picture. The figures are those of his friends and students, and include a self-portrait. Although there are photographs by Eakins which relate to the painting, the picture&#x27;s powerful pyramidal composition and sculptural conception of the individual bodies are completely distinctive pictorial resolutions. The work was painted on commission, but was refused.

In the late 1890s Eakins returned to the male figure, this time in a more urban setting. &quot;Taking the Count&quot; (1896), a painting of a prizefight, was his second largest canvas, but not his most successful composition. The same may be said of &quot;Wrestlers&quot; (1899). More successful was &quot;Between Rounds&quot; (1899), for which boxer Billy Smith posed seated in his corner at Philadelphia&#x27;s Arena; in fact, all the principal figures were posed by models re-enacting what had been an actual fight. &quot;Salutat&quot; (1898), a frieze-like composition in which the main figure is isolated, &quot;is one of Eakins&#x27; finest achievements in figure-painting.&quot;

Although Eakins was agnostic, he painted &quot;The Crucifixion&quot; in 1880. (image link) Art historian Akela Reason says:

Eakins&#x27;s selection of this subject has puzzled some art historians who, unable to reconcile what appears to be an anomalous religious image by a reputedly agnostic artist, have related it solely to Eakins&#x27;s desire for realism, thus divesting the painting of its religious content. Lloyd Goodrich, for example, considered this illustration of Christ&#x27;s suffering completely devoid of &quot;religious sentiment&quot; and suggested that Eakins intended it simply as a realist study of the male nude body. As a result, art historians have frequently associated &#x27;Crucifixion&#x27; (like Swimming) with Eakins&#x27;s strong interest in anatomy and the nude.

In his later years Eakins persistently asked his female portrait models to pose in the nude, a practice which would have been all but prohibited in conventional Philadelphia society. Inevitably, his desires were frustrated.

==Personal life and marriage==

The nature of Eakins&#x27; sexuality and its impact on his art is a matter of intense scholarly debate. Strong circumstantial evidence points to discussion during Eakins&#x27;s lifetime that he had homosexual tendencies, and there is little doubt that he was attracted to men, as evidenced in his photography, and three major paintings where male buttocks are a focal point: &quot;The Gross Clinic&quot;, &quot;Salutat&quot;, and &quot;The Swimming Hole&quot;. The last, in which Eakins appears, is increasingly seen as sensuous and autobiographical.

Until recently, major Eakins scholars persistently denied he was homosexual, and such discussion was marginalized. While there is still no consensus, today discussion of homoerotic desire plays a large role in Eakins scholarship. The discovery of a large trove of Eakins&#x27; personal papers in 1984 has also driven reassessment of his life.

Eakins met Emily Sartain, daughter of John Sartain, while studying at the academy. Their romance floundered after Eakins moved to Paris to study, and she accused him of immorality. It is likely Eakins had told her of frequenting places where prostitutes assembled. The son of Eakins&#x27; physician also reported that Eakins had been &quot;very loose sexually—went to France, where there are no morals, and the French morality suited him to a T&quot;.

In 1884, at age 40, Eakins married Susan Hannah Macdowell, the daughter of a Philadelphia engraver. Two years earlier Eakins&#x27; sister Margaret, who had acted as his secretary and personal servant, had died of typhoid. It has been suggested that Eakins married to replace her. Macdowell was 25 when Eakins met her at the Hazeltine Gallery where &quot;The Gross Clinic&quot; was being exhibited in 1875. Unlike many, she was impressed by the controversial painting and she decided to study with him at the academy, which she attended for six years, adopting a sober, realistic style similar to her teacher&#x27;s. Macdowell was an outstanding student and winner of the Mary Smith Prize for the best painting by a matriculating woman artist.

During their childless marriage, she painted only sporadically and spent most of her time supporting her husband&#x27;s career, entertaining guests and students, and faithfully backing him in his difficult times with the academy, even when some members of her family aligned against Eakins. She and Eakins shared a passion for photography, both as photographers and subjects, and employed it as a tool for their art. She also posed nude for many of his photos and took images of him. Both had separate studios in their home. After Eakins&#x27; death in 1916, she returned to painting, adding considerably to her output right up to the 1930s, in a style that became warmer, looser, and brighter in tone. She died in 1938. Thirty-five years after her death, in 1973, she had her first one-woman exhibition at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.

In the latter years of his life, Eakins&#x27; constant companion was the handsome sculptor Samuel Murray, who shared his interest in boxing and bicycling. The evidence suggests the relationship was more emotionally important to Eakins than that with his wife.

Throughout his life, Eakins appears to have been drawn to those who were mentally vulnerable and then preyed upon those weaknesses. Several of his students ended their lives in insanity.

==Death and legacy==
Eakins died on June 25, 1916, at the age of 71 and is buried at The Woodlands, which is located near the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia.

Late in life Eakins did experience some recognition. In 1902, he was made a National Academician. In 1914, the sale of a portrait study of D. Hayes Agnew for &quot;The Agnew Clinic&quot; to Dr. Albert C. Barnes precipitated much publicity when rumors circulated that the selling price was fifty thousand dollars. In fact, Barnes bought the painting for four thousand dollars.

In the year after his death, Eakins was honored with a memorial retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and in 1917–18 the Pennsylvania Academy followed suit. Susan Macdowell Eakins did much to preserve his reputation, including giving the Philadelphia Museum of Art more than fifty of her husband&#x27;s oil paintings. After her death in 1938, other works were sold off, and eventually another large collection of art and personal material was purchased by Joseph Hirshhorn, and now is part of the Hirshhorn Museum&#x27;s collection. Since then, Eakins&#x27; home in North Philadelphia was put on the National Register of Historic Places list in 1966, and Eakins Oval, across from the Philadelphia Museum of Art on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, was named for the artist. In 1967 &quot;The Biglin Brothers Racing&quot; (1872) was reproduced on a United States postage stamp. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

Eakins&#x27; attitude toward realism in painting, and his desire to explore the heart of American life proved influential. He taught hundreds of students, among them his future wife Susan Macdowell, African-American painter Henry Ossawa Tanner, and Thomas Anshutz, who taught, in turn, Robert Henri, George Luks, John Sloan, and Everett Shinn, future members of the Ashcan School, and other realists and artistic heirs to Eakins&#x27; philosophy. Though his is not a household name, and though during his lifetime Eakins struggled to make a living from his work, today he is regarded as one of the most important American artists of any period.
Since the 1990s, Eakins has emerged as a major figure in sexuality studies in art history, for both the homoeroticism of his male nudes and for the complexity of his attitudes toward women. Controversy shaped much of his career as a teacher and as an artist. He insisted on teaching men and women &quot;the same&quot;, used nude male models in female classes and vice versa, and was accused of abusing female students.

Recent scholarship suggests that these scandals were grounded in more than the &quot;puritanical prudery&quot; of his contemporaries—as had once been assumed—and that Eakins&#x27; progressive academic principles may have protected unconscious and dubious agendas. These controversies may have been caused by a combination of factors such as the bohemianism of Eakins and his circle (in which students, for example, sometimes modeled in the nude for each other), the intensity and authority of his teaching style, and Eakins&#x27; inclination toward unorthodox or provocative behavior.

===Disposition of estate===
Eakins was unable to sell many of his works during his lifetime, so when he died in 1916, a large body of artwork passed to his widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. She carefully preserved it, donating some of the strongest pieces to various museums. When she in turn died in 1938, much of the remaining artistic estate was destroyed or damaged by executors, and the remainders were belatedly salvaged by a former Eakins student. For more details, see the article &quot;List of works by Thomas Eakins&quot;.

On November 11, 2006, the board of trustees at Thomas Jefferson University agreed to sell &quot;The Gross Clinic&quot; to the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC, and the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, for a record $68 million, the highest price for an Eakins painting as well as a record price for an individual American-made portrait. On December 21, 2006, a group of donors agreed to match the price to keep the painting in Philadelphia. It is displayed alternately at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.

==Assessment==

On October 29, 1917, Robert Henri wrote an open letter to the Art Students League about Eakins:

In 1982, in his two-volume Eakins biography, art historian Lloyd Goodrich wrote:

In spite of limitations—and what artist is free of them?—Eakins&#x27; achievement was monumental. He was our first major painter to accept completely the realities of contemporary urban America, and from them to create powerful, profound art... In portraiture alone Eakins was the strongest American painter since Copley, with equal substance and power, and added penetration, depth, and subtlety.

John Canaday, art critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote in 1964:

As a supreme realist, Eakins appeared heavy and vulgar to a public that thought of art, and culture in general, largely in terms of a graceful sentimentality. Today he seems to us to have recorded his fellow Americans with a perception that was often as tender as it was vigorous, and to have preserved for us the essence of an American life which, indeed, he did not idealize—because it seemed to him beautiful beyond the necessity of idealization.

In 2010, the American painter Philip Pearlstein published an article in &quot;ARTnews&quot; suggesting the strong influences Eadweard Muybridge&#x27;s work and public lectures had on 20th-century artists, including Degas, Rodin, Seurat, Duchamp, and Eakins, either directly or through the contemporaneous work of their fellow photographic pioneer, Étienne-Jules Marey. He concluded:

I believe that both Muybridge and Eakins—as a photographer—should be recognized as among the most influential artists on the ideas of 20th-century art, along with Cézanne, whose lessons in fractured vision provided the technical basis for putting those ideas together.

<doc id="102306" wikidata="Q5139011" url="?curid=102306" title="Foreplay">
<text>Foreplay is a set of emotionally and physically intimate acts between one or more people meant to create sexual arousal and desire for sexual activity. Although foreplay is typically understood as physical sexual activity, nonphysical activities, such as mental or verbal acts, may in some contexts be foreplay. This is typically the reason why foreplay tends to be an ambiguous term and means different things to different people. It can consist of various sexual practices such as kissing, sexual touching, removing clothes, oral sex, manual sex, sexual games, and sexual roleplay.

Foreplay is not only about initiating sexual activity but is fundamentally centered on enhancing pleasure for all participants. It serves as a critical phase in sexual encounters that heightens emotional intimacy and physical pleasure, making the sexual experience more fulfilling and satisfying. 

== Role ==

Foreplay has important physical and psychological effects.

Physically, the sexual organs for both partners receive more blood flow and become aroused. For male partners this leads to an erection and for female partners this results in a clitoral erection. When partners experience sexual arousal from the acts of foreplay, their organs that are susceptible to pleasure become highly sensitive to external stimuli all while at the same time releasing bodily fluids that lubricate the organs to prepare for intercourse. These physical events aforementioned are more easily reached by the male partner as compared to the female partner which is possibly due to the potential consequences of pregnancy and motherhood. Because of this reason, foreplay has been found to play a critical role for the female partner, as noted by sexologist Dr. William Robinson. Robinson suggests that male partners are able to perform sexual intercourse without the requirement of foreplay, whereas female partners require longer acts of foreplay to become sufficiently stimulated and pleasured.

Psychologically, foreplay lowers inhibitions and increases emotional intimacy between partners. Both partners, while performing foreplay, are able to have a mutual experience of understanding and emotions. This mutuality leads to an enhanced sexual experience for both partners.

From a biological perspective, foreplay may be seen as an act that is costly in regards to reproduction (male animal perspective). Nonetheless, the costliness of foreplay becomes insufficient when it has been noted through biological research that it is a worthwhile strategy to increase fertility rates in both the animal and human kingdom. The increased rates of fertility are due to physical and psychological effects aforementioned which also play a role in the effects of the neurohypophysial hormone. This hormone is capable of increasing the rate production of sperm count within the male during the acts of extensive foreplay and therefore results with the female partner having higher chances of becoming impregnated.

==Research==
According to a survey on heterosexual couples about duration of sexual intercourse and foreplay, neither partner in these relationships was satisfied with the duration of foreplay in their relationships. This survey sampled 152 couples who were mainly university educated and satisfied with their sexual life. In this study, and when compared to some larger studies, men were better at perceiving desired sexual intercourse and foreplay duration for their partner. The average times spent on intercourse were 7 minutes and 12 minutes on foreplay for the couples in this survey. Another result of this survey was that the length of desired foreplay for men and women was about the same.

In a global study of about 12,000 individuals from 27 countries in 6 continents, physical foreplay was rated as &quot;very important&quot; for 63% of men and 60% of women.

According to a study of individuals in committed romantic relationships, pornography and sexual media usage does not play a role in satisfaction with time spent on foreplay, although other aspects of sexual satisfaction can be impacted by this type of sexual media. This means that foreplay is an important part of the sexual script, and social influences on the sexual script such as pornography and provocative sexual media do not impact foreplay. Time spent on foreplay is an important part of becoming sexually aroused and unique to each individual, and individuals still need the same amount of foreplay in order to become sexually aroused despite what they learn from porn.

==Games==

Sexual role-playing or sex games can create sexual interest. These games can be played in a variety of situations, and have been enhanced by technology. This type of extended foreplay can involve SMS messaging (sexting), phone calls, online chat, or other forms of distance communication, which are intended to stimulate fantasizing about the forthcoming encounter. This tantalization builds up sexual tension.

A card or board game can be played for foreplay. The objective of the game is for the partners to indulge their fantasies. The loser can, for example, be required to remove clothing or give the winner a sensual foot massage or any other thing that the winner wants to try. A sensuous atmosphere can also be enhanced by candles, drinks, sensual food or suggestive clothing. Even a suggestion of the use of sex toys or the playing of games involving fetish, sexual bondage, blindfolding or sploshing is an indication of sexual interest.

Some couples create sexual interest by watching erotic and pornographic videos. Role playing may involve the partners wearing costumes, to create and maintain a sexual fantasy. For variety, the partners can make up a (sexual) story together. One of them starts with a sentence and then the other continues until the story becomes sexually explicit, and it provides an opportunity for the partners to express their sexual fantasies. &quot;Strangers for a day&quot; is a role-playing game which consists of the couple playing roles of the first meeting between them. In a public meeting place, the partners pretend to be strangers meeting for the first time. The objective is for them to flirt and seduce the other, without doing or saying anything that they normally would not do or say at a first meeting.

==Tantric==
Tantric foreplay is the first step in the lovemaking session, according to the tantra principles. Tantric sex is against rushing things for the purpose of reaching an orgasm, so tantric foreplay is a way to prepare the body and the mind for the union between the two bodies. The tantric rules say that foreplay must be focused on the preparation before sexual intercourse. Tantric foreplay may include sensual baths between the two partners in a relaxing atmosphere. Fragrance oil and candles may also be used to set up the mood.

Tantric foreplay is only about giving each other time to connect spiritually and bind. Staring at each other while in a cross-legged position and touching the other&#x27;s hand palms is a usual foreplay tactic used by tantra practitioners.
Tantric foreplay may also include Tantra massages. The massage that is applied, according to the tantric philosophy, is not for reaching orgasms but for giving each other pleasure and connecting at a spiritual level.

== History ==
There are many historical references to foreplay, with many artistic depictions. The Ancient Indian work &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; mentions different types of embracing, kissing, and marking with nails and teeth. It also mentions BDSM activities such as slapping and moaning as &quot;play&quot;. There are also examples of the use of foreplay in marital advice literature that dates back to the early 1900s.

<text>Bernard (&quot;Bernhard&quot;) is a French and West Germanic masculine given name. It has West Germanic origin and is also a surname.

The name is attested from at least the 9th century. West Germanic &quot;Bernhard&quot; is composed from the two elements &quot;bern&quot; &quot;bear&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; &quot;brave, hardy&quot;. Its native Old English cognate was &quot;Beornheard&quot;, which was replaced or merged with the French form &quot;Bernard&quot; that was brought to England after the Norman Conquest. The name &quot;Bernhard&quot; was notably popular among Old Frisian speakers. Its wider use was popularized due to Saint Bernhard of Clairvaux (canonized in 1174). In Ireland, the name was an anglicized form of Brian.

<doc id="102315" wikidata="Q889388" url="?curid=102315" title="The Lumberjack Song">
<text>&quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot; is a comedy song by the comedy troupe Monty Python. The song was written and composed by Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Fred Tomlinson.

It first appeared in the ninth episode of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, &quot;The Ant: An Introduction&quot; on BBC1 on 14 December 1969. The song has since been performed in several forms, including film, stage, and LP, each time started from a different skit. At an NPR interview in 2007, Palin stated that the scene and the whole song were created in about 15 minutes, concluding a day&#x27;s work, when the Python crew was stuck and unable to come up with a conclusion to the barbershop sketch that preceded it.

On 14 November 1975, &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot; was released as a single in the UK, on Charisma Records, backed with &quot;Spam Song&quot;. The A-side, produced by Python devotee George Harrison, was recorded at the Work House studio in London on 3 October 1975 and mixed at Harrison&#x27;s Friar Park home the following day. A year later this single was reissued on 19 November 1976 as the first half of the double single release &quot;Python On Song&quot;. This version of the song has never been released on CD, although a remix containing alternate vocal takes from the session was included on the compilation album &quot;Monty Python Sings&quot;.

== Synopsis ==
The common theme was of an average man (usually Michael Palin, but in the &quot;City Center&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Bowl&quot; versions by Eric Idle) who expresses dissatisfaction with his current job (as a barber, weatherman, pet shop owner, etc.) and then announces, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to be [the given profession]. I wanted to be... a lumberjack!&quot; He proceeds to talk about the life of a lumberjack (&quot;Leaping from tree to tree&quot;), and lists various trees (e.g. larch, fir, Scots pine, and others that do not actually exist). Ripping off his coat to reveal a red flannel shirt, he walks over to a stage with a coniferous forest backdrop and begins to sing about the wonders of being a lumberjack in British Columbia. Then he is unexpectedly backed up by a small choir of male singers, all dressed as Royal Canadian Mounted Police (several were regular Python performers, while the rest were generally members of an actual singing troupe, such as the Fred Tomlinson Singers in the TV version).

In the original sketch from the programme and film version, the girl is played by Connie Booth, John Cleese&#x27;s then-wife; in the live version, the girl is played by Python regular Carol Cleveland. In the version from the film &quot;And Now For Something Completely Different&quot;, it follows on from the &quot;Dead Parrot sketch&quot; with Palin&#x27;s character leaving the pet shop as Eric Praline (played by John Cleese) asks &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, this is irrelevant, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; and eventually &quot;What about my bloody parrot?!&quot;.

In the song, the Lumberjack recounts his daily tasks and his personal life, such as having buttered scones for tea, and the Mountie chorus repeats his lines in sing-song fashion. However, as the song continues, he increasingly reveals cross-dressing tendencies (&quot;I cut down trees, I skip and jump, I like to press wild flowers, I put on women&#x27;s clothing, and hang around in bars&quot;), which both distresses the girl and disturbs the confused Mounties, who continue to repeat and chorus his lines, albeit with increasing hesitance. The last straw comes when he mentions that he wears &quot;high heels, suspenders, and a bra. I wish I&#x27;d been a girlie, just like my dear mama&quot;, and some of the Mounties stop repeating his lines, and they eventually walk off in disgust. Stunned by the Lumberjack&#x27;s revelation, the girl cries out &quot;Oh, Bevis! And I thought you were so rugged!&quot; (in some versions, she says, &quot;I thought you were so butch!&quot; and sometimes slaps him) before running off. In &quot;And Now For Something Completely Different&quot;, at the end of the song the Lumberjack is pelted with rotten fruit and eggs by the Mounties, who can also be heard shouting insults. Another notable difference is that, in the original version, the Lumberjack wishes he was a girlie &quot;just like my dear mama&quot;, whereas subsequent versions replace &quot;mama&quot; with &quot;papa&quot;, implying that the lumberjack inherited his tendency for transvestism from his father.

At the end of the version in &quot;Flying Circus&quot;, a letter written by an outraged viewer (voiced by John Cleese) is shown to complain about the portrayal of lumberjacks in the sketch. The letter reads: &quot;Dear Sir, I wish to complain in the strongest possible terms about the song which you have just broadcast about the lumberjack who wears women&#x27;s clothes. Many of my best friends are lumberjacks, and only a few of them are transvestites. Yours faithfully, Brigadier Sir Charles Arthur Strong (Mrs.) P.S. I have never kissed the editor of the &quot;Radio Times&quot;.&quot; It then cuts to a vox pop of a screeching Pepperpot (Graham Chapman) voicing her objection of &quot;all this sex on the television&quot;, exclaiming, &quot;I keep falling off!&quot; This is followed by an image of an award as text reading &quot;That joke was nominated for this years Rubber Mac of Zurich Award. It came last&quot; scrolls past. It then cuts to a Gumby (Chapman) in front of the forest set, who says, &quot;Well, I think television&#x27;s killed real entertainment. In the old days we used to make our own fun at Christmas parties. I used to strike myself on the head repeatedly with blunt instruments while crooning.&quot; He then proceeds to croon while striking himself in the head with bricks.

==Music==
Part of the melody appears to be a direct quote from the English folk song Foggy Dew. The music is also similar to &quot;Là ci darem la mano&quot;, Don Giovanni&#x27;s and Zerlina&#x27;s duet in Act 1, Scene 2, of Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;.

==Performances==
A German version of &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot; was performed for the 1972 special &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Fliegender Zirkus&quot;, produced for German and Austrian television, for which Palin learned the German text phonetically, and the group of Mounties was replaced by a group of Austrian border guards. Instead of one of his parents, the German version credits the lumberjack&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Walter&quot; as inspiring his passion for cross-dressing; this change was likely done simply for a rhyme with &quot;Büstenhalter&quot;, the German translation for &quot;bra&quot;, which caps the phrase preceding the &quot;I wish I&#x27;d been a girlie...&quot; line. (The subtitles on the A&amp;E DVD release of this special quote the original English lyrics.) A German translation of the angry letter featured at the conclusion of the BBC TV version ends the sketch.

Another German translation is used in the German dub of the film &quot;And now for something completely different&quot; where the Lumberjack Song also appears. For example, whereas the &quot;Fliegender Zirkus&quot; version has the German chorus &quot;Ich bin Holzfäller und fühl&#x27; mich stark, ich schlaf&#x27; des Nachts und hack&#x27; am Tag...&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m a lumberjack and I feel strong, I sleep at night and I chop in the daytime...&quot;, which is the version still remembered by Palin today), the chorus in the German dub in &quot;And now for something completely different&quot; goes &quot;Ich bin Holzfäller und mir geht&#x27;s gut, am Tag packt mich die Arbeitswut...&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m a lumberjack and I&#x27;m okay, I&#x27;m gripped by work mania throughout the day...&quot;); it ends with the &quot;my dear papa&quot;-variant of the song, rhyming with the word &quot;BH&quot; (&quot;beːˈhaː&quot;), the German abbreviation for &quot;Büstenhalter&quot;.

In &quot;Live at Drury Lane&quot;, this song follows on from &quot;Election Night Special&quot;. In &quot;Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;, this song ends the show, following on from &quot;Dead Bishop&quot;.

A version of the song present in this sketch was made in Portugal for a Millennium Bank campaign. The lyrics were slightly changed and translated into Portuguese, as the bank at the time was making an offer involving planting trees.

A Spanish-language version of the song was created for a theatrical performance in 2004. The Yllana and Imprebis theatrical groups jointly presented a show at Madrid&#x27;s Teatro Alfil, consisting of sketches adapted from the Monty Python repertoire. Their version of &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot; was adapted for a Spanish audience so that the singer confessed not to having always wanted to be a lumberjack but having always wanted to join the Guardia Civil, the Spanish gendarmerie. A chorus of uniformed Guardia Civil officers replaced the Mounties from the original television performance.
The song was performed at the Concert for George on 29 November 2002, the first anniversary of George Harrison&#x27;s death. This performance featured Palin, Cleveland, Idle, Jones, Terry Gilliam, Neil Innes and special guest Tom Hanks. At the conclusion of the performance, the troupe turned to face a portrait of George Harrison projected on the back of the stage, and saluted him. During his 1974 North American tour, Harrison would play a recording of &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot; over the arena public address systems before taking the stage to perform. In April 1976, while Monty Python were performing in New York, Harrison joined them onstage dressed as a Mountie for this song. Harrison also was the producer of the Python film &quot;Life of Brian&quot;.

In the &quot;Shining Time Station&quot; Christmas Special, Ringo Starr as Mr. Conductor is dressed in lumberjack attire, he sings the intro to the song, but changes the lyrics to &quot;I&#x27;m a lumberjack and I&#x27;m all right.&quot;

The song was also performed by the Python members as an encore on the oratorio &quot;Not the Messiah (He&#x27;s a Very Naughty Boy)&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall on 23 October 2009, with Palin doing the lead performance and with Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam in the Mounties chorus and Carol Cleveland as the best girl.

, the most recent public performance of the song by Python members was in the &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot; show in July 2014, with the same cast as in the 2009 performance. It follows on from the &quot;Vocational Guidance Counsellor&quot; sketch, with Palin&#x27;s Mr. Anchovy turning into the lumberjack. Across the 10 shows, Palin would often claim following &quot;I wanted to be ...&quot; a different job than a Lumberjack [in the final performance, a &quot;systems analyst&quot;], but recalls a memory which led him to desire a job as a lumberjack, leading to the song. In other performances, Palin would simply sit silently for a period of time, with a confused expression, before announcing he wanted to be a lumberjack.

==Thematic successors==
In &quot;Spamalot&quot;, the song &quot;He is Not Yet Dead (playoff)&quot; is thematically similar. Both feature a masculine man singing about seemingly masculine items, but gradually degrading, and both ending in the singer expressing a wish to wear &quot;suspenders and a bra&quot;, and both choruses being disgusted at this point. In &quot;Not the Messiah (He&#x27;s a Very Naughty Boy)&quot;, the song &quot;A Fair Day&#x27;s Work&quot; makes references to &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot;, with Eric Idle singing about the masculine virtues of work, but also of dressing in women&#x27;s clothing to go to &quot;naughty bars&quot;. The chorus responds: &quot;That&#x27;s enough of that, okay. We don&#x27;t give a duck if you&#x27;re completely gay.&quot;

In &quot;Truck Drivin&#x27; Song&quot; by Weird Al Yankovic a similar theme has a deep voiced singer starting to sing about very masculine activities juxtaposed with applying make-up and wearing high heeled shoes.

The French rock band Underzut pays homage to the Monty Python with two songs including &quot;Lumberjack&quot; (and also &quot;Bicycle Repairman&quot;) on the album &quot;Bubbles in my blood&quot;. Both titles were the subject of video clips.

<doc id="102317" wikidata="Q36653" url="?curid=102317" title="Oscan language">
<text>Oscan is an extinct Indo-European language of southern Italy. The language is in the Osco-Umbrian or Sabellic branch of the Italic languages. Oscan is therefore a close relative of Umbrian and South Picene. 

Oscan was spoken by a number of tribes, including the Samnites, the Lucani, the Aurunci (Ausones), and the Sidicini. The latter two tribes were often grouped under the name &quot;Osci&quot;. The Oscan group is part of the Osco-Umbrian or Sabellic family, and includes the Oscan language and three variants (Hernican, Marrucinian and Paelignian) known only from inscriptions left by the Hernici, Marrucini and Paeligni, minor tribes of eastern central Italy. Adapted from the Etruscan alphabet, the Central Oscan alphabet was used to write Oscan in Campania and surrounding territories from the 5th century BCE until at least the 1st century CE.

==Evidence==

Oscan is known from inscriptions dating as far back as the 5th century BCE. The most important Oscan inscriptions are the Tabula Bantina, the Oscan Tablet or Tabula Osca, and the Cippus Abellanus. In Apulia, there is evidence that ancient currency was inscribed in Oscan (dating to before 300 BCE) at Teanum Apulum. Oscan graffiti on the walls of Pompeii indicate its persistence in at least one urban environment well into the 1st century of the common era.

In total, as of 2017, there were 800 found Oscan texts, with a rapid expansion in recent decades. Oscan was written in various scripts depending on time period and location, including the &quot;native&quot; Oscan script, the South Oscan script which was based on Greek, and the ultimately prevailing Roman Oscan script.

===Demise===
In coastal zones of Southern Italy, Oscan is thought to have survived three centuries of bilingualism with Greek between 400 and 100 BCE, making it &quot;an unusual case of stable societal bilingualism&quot; wherein neither language became dominant or caused the death of the other; however, over the course of the Roman period, both Oscan and Greek were progressively effaced from Southern Italy, excepting the controversial possibility of Griko representing a continuation of ancient dialects of Greek.
Oscan&#x27;s usage declined following the Social War. Graffiti in towns across the Oscan speech area indicate it remained in colloquial usage. One piece of evidence that supports the colloquial usage of the language is the presence of Oscan graffiti on walls of Pompeii that were reconstructed after the earthquake of 62 CE, which must therefore have been written between 62 and 79 CE. Other scholars argue that this is not strong evidence for the survival of Oscan as an official language in the area, given the disappearance of public inscriptions in Oscan after Roman colonization. It is possible that both languages existed simultaneously under different conditions, in which Latin was given political, religious, and administrative importance while Oscan was considered a &quot;low&quot; language. This phenomenon is referred to as diglossia with bilingualism. Some Oscan graffiti exists from the 1st century CE, but it is rare to find evidence from Italy of Latin-speaking Roman citizens representing themselves as having non–Latin-speaking ancestors.

==General characteristics==
Oscan speakers came into close contact with the Latium population. Early Latin texts have been discovered nearby major Oscan settlements. For example, the Garigliano Bowl was found close to Minturnae, less than 40 kilometers from Capua, which was once a large Oscan settlement. Oscan had much in common with Latin, though there are also many striking differences, and many common word-groups in Latin were absent or represented by entirely different forms. For example, Latin &quot;volo&quot;, &quot;velle&quot;, &quot;volui&quot;, and other such forms from the Proto-Indo-European root (&#x27;to will&#x27;) were represented by words derived from (&#x27;to desire&#x27;): Oscan &quot;herest&quot; (&#x27;(s)he shall want, (s)he shall desire&#x27;, German cognate &#x27;begehren&#x27;, Dutch &#x27;begeren&#x27;, English cognate &#x27;yearn&#x27;) as opposed to Latin &quot;volent&quot; (id.). Latin &quot;locus&quot; (place) was absent and represented by the hapax &quot;slaagid&quot; (place), which Italian linguist Alberto Manco has linked to a surviving local toponym.

In phonology too, Oscan exhibited a number of clear differences from Latin: thus, Oscan &#x27;p&#x27; in place of Latin &#x27;qu&#x27; (Osc. &quot;pis&quot;, Lat. &quot;quis&quot;) (compare the similar P-Celtic/Q-Celtic cleavage in the Celtic languages); &#x27;b&#x27; in place of Latin &#x27;v&#x27;; medial &#x27;f&#x27; in contrast to Latin &#x27;b&#x27; or &#x27;d&#x27; (Osc. &quot;mefiai&quot;, Lat. &quot;mediae&quot;).

Oscan is considered to be the most conservative of all the known Italic languages, and among attested Indo-European languages it is rivaled only by Greek in the retention of the inherited vowel system with the diphthongs intact.

==Writing system==
===Alphabet===

Oscan was originally written in a specific &quot;Oscan alphabet&quot;, one of the Old Italic scripts derived from (or cognate with) the Etruscan alphabet. Later inscriptions are written in the Greek and Latin alphabets.

====The &quot;Etruscan&quot; alphabet====
The Osci probably adopted the archaic Etruscan alphabet during the 7th century BCE, but a recognizably Oscan variant of the alphabet is attested only from the 5th century BCE. At the beginning of the 3rd century BCE its sign inventory was extended over the classical Etruscan alphabet by the introduction of lowered variants of I and U, transcribed as Í and Ú. Ú came to be used to represent Oscan , while U was used for as well as historical long , which had undergone a sound shift in Oscan to become . Í was used to denote a higher-mid .

The &quot;Z&quot; of the native alphabet is pronounced . Doubling of vowels was used to denote length but a long &quot;I&quot; is written &quot;IÍ&quot;.

====The &quot;Greek&quot; alphabet====
Oscan written with the Greek alphabet was identical to the standard alphabet with the addition of two letters: one for the native alphabet&#x27;s &quot;H&quot;: , and one for its &quot;V&quot;: . The letters &quot;η&quot; and &quot;ω&quot; do not indicate quantity. Sometimes, the clusters &quot;ηι&quot; and &quot;ωϝ&quot; denote the diphthongs and respectively while &quot;ει&quot; and &quot;oυ&quot; are saved to denote monophthongs and of the native alphabet. At other times, &quot;ει&quot; and &quot;oυ&quot; are used to denote diphthongs, in which case &quot;o&quot; denotes the sound.

====The &quot;Latin&quot; alphabet====
When written in the Latin alphabet, the Oscan &quot;Z&quot; does not represent but instead , which is not written differently from in the native alphabet.

====Transliteration====
When Oscan inscriptions are quoted, it is conventional to transliterate those in the &quot;Oscan&quot; alphabet into Latin boldface, those in the &quot;Latin&quot; alphabet into Latin &quot;italics&quot;, and those in the &quot;Greek&quot; alphabet into the modern Greek alphabet. Letters of all three alphabets are represented in lower case.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Vowels are regularly lengthened before &quot;ns&quot; and &quot;nct&quot; (in the latter of which the &quot;n&quot; is lost) and possibly before &quot;nf&quot; and &quot;nx&quot; as well.
Anaptyxis, the development of a vowel between a liquid or nasal and another consonant, preceding or following, occurs frequently in Oscan; if the other (non-liquid/nasal) consonant precedes, the new vowel is the same as the preceding vowel. If the other consonant follows, the new vowel is the same as the following vowel.

====Monophthongs====

=====A=====
Short &quot;a&quot; remains in most positions
Long &quot;ā&quot; remains in an initial or medial position. Final &quot;ā&quot; starts to sound similar to so that it is written &quot;ú&quot; or, rarely, &quot;u&quot;.

=====E=====
Short &quot;e&quot; &quot;generally remains unchanged;&quot; before a labial in a medial syllable, it becomes &quot;u&quot; or &quot;i&quot;, and before another vowel, &quot;e&quot; raises to higher-mid [ẹ], written &quot;í&quot;.
Long &quot;ē&quot; similarly raises to higher-mid [ẹ], the sound of written &quot;í&quot; or &quot;íí&quot;.

=====I=====
Short &quot;i&quot; becomes written &quot;í&quot;.
Long &quot;ī&quot; is spelt with &quot;i&quot; but when written with doubling as a mark of length with &quot;ií&quot;.

=====O=====
Short &quot;o&quot; remains mostly unchanged, written &quot;ú&quot;; before a final &quot;-m&quot;, &quot;o&quot; becomes more like &quot;u&quot;.
Long &quot;ō&quot; becomes denoted by &quot;u&quot; or &quot;uu&quot;.

=====U=====
Short &quot;u&quot; generally remains unchanged; after &quot;t&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, the sound becomes that of &quot;iu&quot;. 
Long &quot;ū&quot; generally remains unchanged; it changed to an ī sound in monosyllables, and may have changed to an &quot;ī&quot; sound for final syllables.

====Diphthongs====

Oscan had the following diphthongs:
The sounds of diphthongs remain unchanged from the Proto-Indo-European origins.

===Consonants=== 
The consonant inventory of Oscan is as follows:

====S====
In Oscan, &quot;s&quot; between vowels did not undergo rhotacism as it did in Latin and Umbrian; but it was voiced, becoming the sound . However, between vowels, the original cluster &quot;rs&quot; developed either to a simple &quot;r&quot; with lengthening on the preceding vowel, or to a long &quot;rr&quot; (as in Latin), and at the end of a word, original &quot;rs&quot; becomes &quot;r&quot; just as in Latin. Unlike in Latin, the s is not dropped, either Oscan or Umbrian, from the consonant clusters &quot;sm&quot;, &quot;sn&quot;, &quot;sl&quot;: Umbrian &quot;`sesna&quot; &quot;dinner,&quot; Oscan kersnu vs Latin &quot;cēna&quot;.

== Morphology ==

===Noun declension===
Oscan nouns can have one of the seven cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative and locative (the latter is not present in Latin). Oscan nouns, like in Latin, are divided into multiple declension patterns.

====Second-declension nouns====
The second declension in Oscan has a few features that distinguish it from its Latin counterpart.
* The nominative singular of masculines features the syncope of &quot;*-os&quot; to &quot;-s&quot;, leading to further phonetic and orthographic consequences.
* The genitive singular -eís is taken from the &quot;i&quot;-stems.
* The nominative plural -ús preserves the usual Indo-European nominative plural ending for animate thematic nouns, which Latin replaced with &quot;-ī&quot; &lt; &quot;*-oi&quot; from pronominal declensions.

These nouns in Oscan are declined as follows:

====Third-declension nouns====
Like in Latin, the third declension in Oscan is a merger of the &quot;i&quot;-stem nouns with the consonant-stem nouns.

These nouns in Oscan are declined as follows. Neuters are not attested.

=== Verbal system ===
Verbs in Oscan are inflected for the following categories:
* Tense (present, imperfect, future, perfect, and future perfect), 
* Voice (active, deponent/passive)
* Mood (indicative, imperative, subjunctive)
* Person (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
* Number (singular, plural)

Present, future and future perfect forms in the active voice use the following set of personal endings:
Imperfect, perfect indicative and all tenses of the subjunctive in the active voice use a different set of endings:

Passive endings are attested only for the 3rd person: singular &quot;-ter&quot;, plural &quot;-nter&quot;.

Perfect stems are derived from the present stem in different ways. Latin &quot;-vī-&quot; and &quot;-s-&quot; perfects are not attested in Oscan. Instead, Oscan uses its own set of forms, including reduplicated perfects such as deded &#x27;gave&#x27;, &quot;-tt-&quot; suffix as in prúfa-tt-ed &#x27;approved&#x27;, &quot;-k-&quot; suffix as in kella-k-ed &#x27;collected, and &quot;-f-&quot; suffix as in aíkda-f-ed &#x27;rebuilt&#x27;. Some verbs also use suppletive forms.

Other tenses are formed by suffixation:
The following non-finite forms are attested (all of them are based on the present stem):

Notes: Oscan &quot;carn-&quot; “part, piece” is related to Latin &quot;carn-&quot; “meat” (seen in English ‘carnivore’), from an Indo-European root &quot;*ker-&quot; meaning ‘cut’―apparently the Latin word originally meant ‘piece (of meat).’ Oscan &quot;tangin-&quot; &quot;judgement, assent&quot; is ultimately related to English &#x27;think&#x27;.

<doc id="102318" wikidata="Q36957" url="?curid=102318" title="Umbrian language">
<text>Umbrian is an extinct Italic language formerly spoken by the Umbri in the ancient Italian region of Umbria. Within the Italic languages it is closely related to the Oscan group and is therefore associated with it in the group of Osco-Umbrian languages, a term generally replaced by Sabellic in modern scholarship. Since that classification was first formulated, a number of other languages in ancient Italy were discovered to be more closely related to Umbrian. Therefore, a group, the Umbrian languages, was devised to contain them.

==Corpus==
Umbrian is known from about 30 inscriptions dated from the 7th through 1st centuries BC. The largest cache by far is the Iguvine Tablets, seven inscribed bronze tablets found in 1444 near the village of Scheggia or, according to another tradition, in an underground chamber at Gubbio (ancient &quot;Iguvium&quot;). The seven tablets contain notes on the ceremonies and statutes for priests of the ancient religion in the region. Sometimes they are called the Eugubian tablets after the medieval name of Iguvium/Eugubium. The tablets contain 4000–5000 words.

Other minor inscriptions are from Todi, Assisi and Spoleto.

==Alphabet==
The Iguvine tablets were written in two alphabets. The older, the Umbrian alphabet, like other Old Italic script, was derived from the Etruscan alphabet, and was written right-to-left, essentially equivalent to the Neo-Etruscan, but using a letter shaped like a &#x27;P&#x27; from the Archaic Etruscan alphabet for the unique Umbrian sound discussed below. The newer was written in the Latin script. The texts are sometimes called Old Umbrian and New Umbrian. The differences are mainly orthographic. For example, &quot;rs&quot; in the Latin alphabet is represented by a single character in the native script (generally transcribed as ř; this represents an unknown sound that developed regularly from intervocalic *-d- in most cases). To clearly distinguish them, the native script is generally transcribed in bold, the Latin in italics.
==Grammar==

===Phonology===
The exact phonetics of much of what follows are not completely clear.

====Consonants====
The consonant inventory of Umbrian is as follows:

====Vowels====

Pure: i, e, a, o, u; ā, ē, ī, ō, ū

Diphthongs: ai, ei, ou

===Nouns===

==== Declension ====

===== First Declension =====
The Umbrian first declension retained the elongated stem in the nominative singular, whereas in Latin it shortened to . However, the vowel &quot;ā&#x27; in Umbrian became a more rounded vowel akin to the &quot;a&quot; in English &quot;call.&quot; Umbrian also retained the elongated stem in the accusative singular, although the final is often dropped in writing, likely because the final sound was pronounced so faintly that it was somewhat negligible. The accusative plural form derives from Proto-Italic , which evolved into . The final was pronounced so weakly that it is often dropped often from inscriptions, although this is more common in the later Iguvine tablets written in the Latin script than the older Iguvine tablets written in the Old Italic script. For the dative singular, the Proto-Italic diphthong was monophthongized to . It was likely an open vowel as it is never misspelt with , which occurs frequently in the related Oscan language for terms with or in the final syllables. Like Latin, Umbrian dropped the final at the end of words; thus, the ablative singular form in Umbrian evolved into from . Umbrian inherited the genitive singular ending from Proto-Italic, which also appears in Old Latin and persisted into Classical Latin through terms such as . The genitive plural ending, , likely retained the long as—in neither Oscan nor Umbrian—is vowel contraction observed prior to the final consonants , , , and . Although there is no attested first declension vocative plural, the vocative singular likely appears in certain names and was likely marked by the ending . Buck concludes that it was likely a short vowel as it is never misspelt as in inscriptions. The locative singular ending is identical with that of the dative singular; however, no locative plurals are attested. In Umbrian inscriptions, the locative ending was often suffixed by the postpositive form , which was sometimes written separately from the word (for instance, &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;to carry on a table&quot;) or merged with the term through contraction (see , meaning &quot;into the field&quot;). In some circumstances, the form altered to through contraction; for example, the term , meaning &quot;at Acedonia.&quot; There is also evidence of masculine proper names bearing the same stem of the first declension. Such names are occasionally borrowed from Greek, although they omit the final ; names such as from (&quot;,&quot; &quot;Archias&quot;). Other names end in and appear to derive from Italic sources, such as or . Only one oblique form for masculine first declension forms is attested: the accusative singular form . Another form, that possibly was a genitive singular of a masculine first declension term, is attested: .
===== Second declension =====
The Proto-Italic nominative singular ending lost the , leaving the Umbrian nominative singular ending , as represented by Umbrian terms such as (&quot;quiet&quot;). Umbrian preserved the Proto-Italic accusative plural ending , although it was represented in Umbrian by the graphemes , , , and . The accusative singular form was merely the vowel , occasionally written orthographically as or , although it was more common for the final to be omitted. Thus, the Umbrian word for &quot;people&quot; can be written as or and as or , presumably because the final was pronounced so faintly that it was often ignored. The accusative plural form , or , deriving from Proto-Italic , was also written without the final , presumably because the sound was also pronounced so weakly that writers often opted to neglect it. During the transition from Proto-Italic, the dative singular form shortened to and then was monophthongized in Umbrian. Orthographically, it was written as , , , , and . Umbrian lost the final of the Proto-Italic ablative singular ending . The ablative singular was near unanimously transcribed as ; the example constitutes the only definitive evidence of an ablative singular denoted by and the term , although it has also been interpreted as a locative singular marked by , may be interpreted as an ablative singular form. The dative and ablative cases shared the same plural endings, which were orthographically represented by a multitude of forms:, , , , , , , , and . Of these endings, the most common is , with , appearing in over 100 inscriptions, although only appears in 7 inscriptions and appears in only 6. Unlike the other second declension forms, which derived from Proto-Italic o-stem nouns, the genitive singular inherited the from the Proto-Italic i-stem declension. It was typically represented in writing through the forms , , , although the endings and appear rarely. In contrast, the genitive plural ending was inherited from the equivalent Proto-Italic o-stem form and was typically represented in Umbrian , , or . The vocative singular form in Umbrian was and the locative singular was the long vowel , frequently—or perhaps always—compounded with the postpositive .

Another subtype of the second declension appears in the second declension stem nouns, which derive from terms ending in or . The nominative and accusative singular in both masculine and neuter forms was marked by the phoneme , which could be written as or . However, these graphemes were relatively uncommon compared to the forms or , which appear in terms such as the nominative or accusative singular neuter form or the accusative singular masculine form , both of which may derive from . Other irregular forms may surface in the hapax &quot; possibly was an stem noun that conveyed the short vowel through the ending , an orthographic choice that, although attested elsewhere in the language, remains uncommon. The term , possibly deriving from , may also have replaced the standard ending with . The remaining forms are identical with those of the standard second declension endings, although in the ablative and dative singular and plural forms contraction is possible. This feature, which is more common in Late Iguvine writings than Early Iguvine, can be overserved in the dative singular form , which can be alternatively written as or . 

In addition to the masculine second declensions, there is also a slightly distinct morphology for neuter second declension forms. The only known differences between the second declension masculine and neuter forms appear in the nominative and accusative singular and plural: the neuter nominative and accusative singular are identical with each other and the masculine accusative singular, while the neuter accusative plural—which are also identical with each other—were represented by the ending and were represented orthographically by , , or . There were other, rarer, endings utilize to mark the nominative or accusative neuter plural: the form is attested for the nominative plural and the forms or , which could also be written without the final , are attested as representations of the accusative plural. Buck suggests that this irregularity possibly originated in the accusative plural before spreading the nominative; he suggests it was likely that it was motivated by the existence of parallel forms in the standard masculine nominative and accusative plural. 
===== Third declension =====
The Umbrian third declension, like the Latin third declension, merged forms from the Proto-Italic consonant stem and i-stem declensions. In Proto-Italic, the nominative singular of these declensions was and respectively. During the transition to Umbrian, the /i/ vowel was syncopated, producing a nominative singular ending for all third declension forms. However, the nominative plural endings vary depending upon whether the term was inherited from the consonant or i-stem terms. I-stem terms likely inherited the ending , although the Oscan nominative plural formation &quot; Indicates that at least the Oscan language, and possibly the Osco-Umbrian languages at large, may have evolved the ending according to the model of the first and second declension forms and . Consonant stems syncopated the short vowel ending in Proto-Italic, resulting in a more unique evolution. The term , which is used in the nominative plural, presumably evolved from the from , which contracted to before arriving at . This term is also misspelt as in one inscription, which may provide evidence of compensatory lengthening.

In the accusative singular, Umbrian i-stem forms inherited the Proto-Italic ending , which was often represented by the graphemes or , although the spelling occurs rarely. For consonant stems, the Proto-Italic ending was replaced by , which was borrowed from the second declension forms. The accusative plural ending, in the i-stem, shifted the final in Proto-Italic to , resulting in the form . However, the was often omitted in writing and the could be rendered as , sometimes including ; thus, forms such as &quot;,&quot; &quot;,&quot; and &quot;&quot; appear for &quot;.&quot; Consonant stems followed a more distinct evolution; although they contracted the in Proto-Italic to , they dropped the , leading to the form instead of the expected form . Such an evolution could theoretically have been explained through the syncopation of a short , however the contraction of to appears to have been accompanied by the lengthening of the preceding vowel. It is possible, although disputed, that the original Proto-Italic forms contained long vowels, allowing for an explanation of the unusual form through regular syncopation. Buck proposes that, in the absence of the aforementioned explanation, the form may have emerged due to the influence of the accusative plural forms of the other declensions, which were typically preceded by the same phonemes as the of the nominative plural. 

The i-stem forms developed the open vowel in the dative singular, which was represented by the graphemes , , and—occasionally—, although this form is of exceptional rarity. I-stem forms also adopted an ablative singular form , which was represented orthographically by either , , , and—rarely—. In consonant stems, the ablative singular ending was . The dative-ablative plural form, in i-stems, evolved from the Proto-Italic from into , which became through syncopation. The ending is attested in one Oscan term, &quot;,&quot; however all other Oscan and Umbrian forms showcases that the was assimilated, leading to the ending found in Umbrian terms such as &quot;.&quot; However, it was alternatively written with the substituted for ; thus, Umbrian forms such as &quot;.&quot; Consonant stems inherited their dative and ablative plural forms from the Proto-Italic u-stem nouns, resulting in forms such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;.&quot; Both i-stem and consonant stem third declension forms inherited the Proto-Italic i-stem genitive singular form , which was orthographically represented by the forms and . The third-declension locative singular ending is attested in terms such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;,&quot; both of which were marked graphically by the ending , although considers it likely that consonant-stem forms had inherited the Proto-Italic ending while i-stem forms had inherited the Proto-Italic ending .

Therre are also attestations of neuter forms for the third declension. Terms such as &quot; suggest that the Umbrian neuter nominative and accusative singular for third declension i-stem terms, like Latin, was marked by the ending , although other terms such as &quot; indicate that, also like Latin, the final could be omitted. There are a few examples of consonant stem third declension neuter nouns, such as &quot;,&quot; &quot;&quot;, and &quot;.&quot; Consonant stem neuter nouns inherited the ending from Proto-Italic for the nominative and accusative plural, while i-stem nouns evolved the ending from Proto-Italic. The final would change regularly according to the standard phonological and graphical rules in Umbrian governing the form of the final vowel.
===== Fourth and Fifth Declensions =====
There is little attestation as the Umbrian fourth or fifth declension. The fourth declension accusative singular was seemingly represented orthographically by the form , which was often used to represent the ending in Umbrian writings. Nominative and accusative plural forms are attested for the fourth declension neuter. It is likely that the ending was , although it would have been represented orthographically in various ways according to the standard Umbrian writing conventions for final . Other forms attested to a genitive singular ending in , a dative singular in , an ablative singular form in , and a dative-ablative plural in . One locative form is attested: . The majority of attested Umbrian fourth declension terms appear feminine or neuter, however the Umbrian form appears masculine in contrast to the feminine Latin cognate . Few fifth declension forms are attested in Umbrian: the accusative plural &quot;,&quot; the dative-ablative plural &quot;,&quot; the dative singular &quot;,&quot; and the form &quot;,&quot; which serves as both a dative or ablative singular.

=== Verbal system ===

==== Conjugation ====
The Umbrian first conjugation is distinguished by the thematic vowel in the present conjugation, although it typically appeared throughout the various inflected forms for each conjugation rather than exclusively the present. However, rare perfect and perfect passive forms without the morpheme are attested, such as the terms , , and . This irregularity also appears in a select few first conjugation Latin verbs, such as the perfect form from . The inflected forms of the first conjugation were formed via the addition of the various suffixes that mark for person and number to the initial , a transformation likely accompanied either by the contraction of the stem, leaving either or before the suffix. In Latin, second, third, or fourth conjugation verbs compounded with a preposition can transform into first conjugation verbs, consider the derivation of (&quot;to dedicate&quot;) from (&quot;to say&quot;). Likewise, the equivalent Umbrian verb derives from the verb .

The Umbrian second conjugation, like the Latin second conjugation, is identified by the presence of the long vowel in the present stem, although—like Latin—it is often absent from the perfect stem. In Latin, attested verbs such as from provide direct proof of the occasional, albeit rare, formation of perfect stem and passive participle with ; however, the existing Umbrian corpus provides no evidence of such irregularities. Another second conjugation verb, (equivalent of Latin &quot;,&quot; &quot;[it] is suitable for&quot;), suggests that the thematic vowel of second conjugation Umbrian verbs could have alternated to . It is also possible that was a rare marker for the Umbrian second conjugation: it appears in one verb, , although this term may have been a fourth conjugation verb. The Umbrian third conjugation is marked by the short vowel just as in Latin, although Umbrian lacks third conjugation verbs, which appear in Latin in verbs such , from ). These verbs, throughout all Italic languages, derive from the variant verbs in Proto-Italic, each of which—likely through vowel syncopation—evolved into a largely regularly-conjugated third or fourth conjugation verb in Umbrian whereas in Latin they constitute their own unique class between the third and fourth conjugations. Examples of Umbrian verbs with reduplicated stems, akin to Latin verbs such as , appear Umbrian third conjugation verbs such as , the exact equivalent of Latin . However, other Umbrian verbs potentially showcase the loss of reduplication; for instance, the verb , possibly from . Fourth conjugation Umbrian verbs, like Latin, are marked by the phoneme in the present stem. Furthermore, like Latin, perfect forms may lack : Umbrian is a form of the fourth conjugation Umbrian verb . 

Present active infinitive forms in Umbrian took the ending , which likely derived from a Proto-Italic accusative formation. However, perfect passive infinitive forms were created through the present infinitive of the Umbrian verb for &quot;to be&quot; with a perfect passive participle. For instance, the Umbrian perfect passive infinitives &quot; (in Latin, &quot;) and &quot; (in Latin, &quot;), meaning &quot;to be cared for&quot; and &quot;to be sent from&quot; respectively. There is limited evidence confirming the existence of supine forms in Umbrian akin to Latin: the only definitive example of a supine formation in Umbrian appears in the phrase , equivalent to Latin &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;[who] shall go to observe.&quot;

==== Perfect formation ====

===== Perfect stem =====
Like other Italic languages, the Umbrian language merged the aorist and perfect tense found in Proto-Italic and Proto-Indo-European, although the Sabellic languages, a language family of which Umbrian is a member, preserved the forms of the Proto-Indo-European athematic second aorist while Latin preserved the perfect forms of Proto-Indo-European. These etymological differences created numerous morphological discrepancies between the Sabellic languages and the Latin-Faliscan languages, the subgroup of Italic languages containing Latin. In Umbrian, the perfect subjunctive was marked the vowel added to the ending while in Latin, it was marked by the vowel . Umbrian perfect stems likely could be formed by 5 distinct types of modification applied to the present stem of the verb: reduplication, the simple perfect, k-perfect, f-perfect, and—a form exclusive to Umbrian—the nky-perfect. Reduplication was the most common method of forming the perfect in the original Proto-Indo-European language and it typically involved the addition of the vowel following the reduplicated syllable. Remnants of this technique appear in Umbrian verbs such as , in which the initial consonant of is reduplicated with an vowel added between the two letters. However, perfect forms that are—in origin—reduplicated perfects may not follow this pattern. This category, referred to as the &quot;simple perfects,&quot; comprise verbs such as , which likely derives from , the perfect stem of the Proto-Italic verb . Although the original form was reduplicated according to the aforementioned pattern, the changed to during the transition from Proto-Italic to Umbrian.

Umbrian perfect forms such as demonstrate the f-perfect, a type of modification that forms perfect stems through the addition of the consonant . The origin of this type of augment is unclear, although it may have derived from the univerbation of older terms. For instance, in the case of , the term may have originated from the , although this etymology specifically is disputed. In Umbrian, perfect stems possibly could be marked through the addition of the consonant , a modification that likely originates from the original sigmatic aorist of the Proto-Indo-European language. This form, the s-perfect, is entirely unattested in Umbrian with the possible exception of one form: . However, this form is more often interpreted as a reduplicated perfect, leaving no evidence of the existence of s-perfects in Umbrian and thus compelling some linguists to reject the existence of such forms in the language. 

The perfect marker , , or appears in Umbrian terms such as and . The etymological origins of this root are unclear, it may have emerged from a reconstructed Proto-Italic form , itself possibly related to Proto-Indo-European (&quot;to bear, to bring.&quot;). This form was preserved into the Ancient Greek term (), the aorist form of (&quot;,&quot; &quot;to bear,&quot; to &quot;bring&quot;) and the Old Irish suffix , found as a marker of perfective aspect in forms such , the perfect stem of (&quot;to give,&quot; &quot;to bring&quot;). The linguist Kenneth Shields, Jr. argued that this perfect ending originated from the combination of third-person singular forms ending in with the deictic particle , creating . According to Shields, this form was later reanalyzed to produce and was then suffixed with , culminating in the form . This form may have then been reanalyzed as , concluding the process of evolution and creating the Umbrian perfect morpheme. Shields proposes that the term may be cognate with the Lithuanian imperative suffix and that the deictic particle can be observed in terms such as Latin (&quot;on,&quot; &quot;to this,&quot; &quot;on this side&quot;) or Ancient Greek (, &quot;this year&quot;). The linguist David Jerrett, noting that perfect marker exclusively appears in denominal verbs, argued that the perfect stem originated from nouns combined with the perfect forms of an unattested Umbrian verb deriving from Proto-Indo-European (meaning, &quot;to lie down, to settle&quot;), which may have developed a new meaning akin to &quot;to set in motion, be in motion.&quot; Such a semantic shift occurred in other Indo-European languages: the Ancient Greek verbs &quot;&quot; (&quot;,&quot; &quot;to set in motion, stir, meddle&quot;) or &quot;&quot; (&quot;,&quot; &quot;to go&quot;) and the Latin verb (&quot;to set in motion, move, stir&quot;) all demonstrate this transformation. When certain nouns were used alongside this unattested verb in periphrastic phrases, they may have merged together to create new verbs. Jerrett cites one possible example of such a development in the verb , which may have originated from the reconstructed noun combined with the verb form 3rd person singular future perfect active form . Thus, Jerret proposes a semantic shift from &quot; ,&quot; meaning &quot;has made an announcement,&quot; to &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;has announced.&quot;

===== Future perfect formation =====
Uniquely, Sabellic future perfects are marked with the ending and, in some cases, . The &quot;&quot; form appeared as, in Umbrian, intervocalic -- became . Both forms are of disputed etymology: it is possible that it relates to the Proto-Italic form , from the Proto-Indo-European form . These verbs, both meaning &quot;to be,&quot; evolved into the Umbrian form , which possibly predicated the development of the similar future perfect endings. However, the linguist Nicholas Zair suggests that, given the dual meaning of as both a future and future perfect term, it is unlikely that it would evolve into an exclusively future perfect suffix. Furthermore, Zair considers it unlikely that the term would be reanalyzed into a unique suffix as it already consists of combined with the future marker . One proposal to rectify these concerns suggests that the suffix may originate from a reduplicated future perfect stem , which, although formed from , came to be reanalyzed as . Alternatively, it may have emerged due to the generalization of the zero-grade Proto-Indo-European perfect active participle root or the lengthened grade , itself possibly from . In either scenario, the forms would yield to in Umbrian due to inevitable loss of initial after most consonants and the loss of long in Oscan-Umbrian in non-initial syllables. However, the linguist Madison Beeler critiqued this theory, arguing that there is insufficient evidence for the existence of a perfect active participle in any Italic language related to the Proto-Indo-European perfect active participle, and consequently no evidence for the existence of such a form of Proto-Italic. 

Another possibility is that this form is related the u-perfect in Latin, as seen in verbs such as or . This theory holds that the original Sabellic future marker, , likely combined with a perfect marker in to form the Umbrian future perfect form . Zair suggests that, although the Umbrian future perfect form was based on an original Sabellic perfect ending, it is entirely unrelated to the Latin perfect. Instead, Zair argues that it was likely related to the possible South Picene perfect formation, which is represented orthographically by and may appear in terms such as (meaning, &quot;they set up&quot;). According to Zair, the original Proto-Indo-European language formulated perfect terms through the reduplication of the initial consonant and the shift of the root into the o-grade, leading the creation of a perfect stem that was transformed into a future perfect stem in Proto-Sabellic through the addition of the morpheme . Zair continues, proposing that the Proto-Sabellic language likely utilized the morpheme in its perfect and aorist tenses, although these were largely lost during the generalization of the perfect stems following the loss of the aorist tense, leaving the future perfect form as the only remnant of the original stem as there were no aorist parallels.

==== Voice ====
The Umbrian language inflected for two voices: the active, which concerned verbs performed by the subject, and the passive, which concerned verbs performed upon the subject. In Umbrian, the passive voice may have additionally partially fulfilled the role of the middle voice: The Umbrian verb , a passive form, was utilized to express the middle meaning of &quot;to raise, elevate oneself;&quot; &quot;to rise.&quot; Like Latin, the Umbrian language contained deponent verbs, verbs that—although passive in form—conveyed active meanings. However, terms that are deponent in Latin are regular in Umbrian and vice versa: the regular Umbrian verb is contrasted with the deponent Latin verb whereas the Umbrian deponent is equivalent to the Latin active form , an inflection oft the verb .

==== Moods ====
The Umbrian language inflects for three grammatical moods: indicative, subjunctive, and imperative. In the Umbrian language, relative clauses are exclusively attested as utilizing the indicative; although, evidence from the closely related Oscan language indicates that it may have been possible to employ the subjunctive in relative clauses that expressed characteristic. Like Latin, the Umbrian subjunctive comprises the old functions of the original Proto-Italic optative and subjunctive, which fused together during the transition from Proto-Italic to Latin and Umbrian. Both the Latin and Umbrian languages exclusively preserved traces of the original optative in subjunctive inflections of verbs that derive from athematic Proto-Italic verbs: the athematic irregular Proto-Italic verb , with the optative 3rd person singular inflection , evolved into Latin and the equivalent Umbrian form . Umbrian and Latin are largely identical in their choice of derivation from either the Proto-Italic subjunctive or optative for their subjunctive forms respectively, although the Umbrian perfect subjunctive forms derive from the Proto-Italic subjunctive whereas in Latin they derive from the optative. Umbrian and Latin both contain the vowel in the endings for the subjunctive forms of the second, third, and fourth conjugations (compare Latin and Umbrian ), while first conjugation verbs shift the vowel in the stem to . One possible exception to this rule appears in the Umbrian verb , which may constitute an subjunctive of a third conjugation verb, although this form may be explained as a perfect indicative form based on the perfect stem of the verb. The Umbrian present imperative is exclusively attested in two first conjugation forms: (&quot;observe&quot;) and (&quot;bargain&quot;), both substituting the final for . All other known Umbrian imperatives represent the future imperative. 

The Subjunctive in Umbrian could also be used to express orders; the subjunctive of command is the most frequently appearing usage of the subjunctive in the Umbrian corpus. This jussive function of the subjunctive appears throughout the Iguvine tablets, which decree &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;[the Flamen] shall have the care of the sacred affair; he shall furnish whatever is necessary.&quot; Carl Darling Buck, an American philologist, argued that, in the attested Umbrian corpus, the jussive subjunctive and the imperative were used largely interchangeably. However, the linguist D.M. Jones suggests that, while the imperative considered specific instructions, the jussive subjunctive was largely limited to descriptions of duties or punishments for officials. Thus, the aforementioned sentences utilized the subjunctive as they were outlining ritual practices for Flamini, while statements such as &quot;&quot; (Jupiter Grabovius, purify!) utilize the imperative. In negative commands, which call for something to not occur, Umbrian primarily utilizes the imperative, although the subjunctive form appears in one inscription to mean &quot;let them not use.&quot; Furthermore, this term appears to violate the previously established distinction between the subjunctive and the imperative, as it used as an explicit instruction. The full sentence, reading &quot;,&quot; may translate to &quot;When he has purified the jar, thereafter they shall not use any of that mead.&quot; This interpretation proposes that the subjunctive form constitutes a special instruction outside of the original description of the ritual, thereby fitting the standard pattern of subjunctive use. However, Jones instead opts to resolve this anomaly with the translation &quot;during the preliminary purification of the the aforesaid mead is not to be used.&quot; Jones argues that this interpretation is not just a more accurate translation but also ensures consistency with the standard rules of the Umbrian subjunctive as—in his version—the prohibitive command is distinct from the actual section of the description of the ritual that first mentions the mead, and thus, there is some level of discontinuity between the two pieces of the text. The Umbrian subjunctive and imperative also seemingly shared the capacity to express optative meanings, a function that—in Latin—is fulfilled by the subjunctive of wish. The Iguvine tablets contain the phrase &quot;,&quot; reading &quot;may you be favorable, be propitious,&quot; which utilizes the subjunctive forms for optative meanings. However, it later contains a phrase of identical meaning which employs the imperative: &quot;.&quot;

Instances of a subjunctive of cause, in which the subjunctive is used in tandem with clauses of cause and result, are also attested in Umbrian. These clauses are typically introduced with the term , the Umbrian equivalent of Latin , meaning—in such clauses—&quot;so that.&quot; However, such clauses can also be introduced without the conjunction: the phrase , reading &quot;demand that I observe,&quot; expresses a meaning that can be translated into English utilizing the word &quot;that,&quot; but lacks the equivalent Umbrian conjunction. Another Umbrian conjunction, or—alternatively—, meaning &quot;if&quot; (compare Latin &quot;&quot;), was involved in indirect questions: the Umbrian sentence &quot;.&quot; reading &quot;if the greater part of the Atiedii brothers announce it to not be properly cared for, then the magister or the quaestor should ask the brothers how many flamini there are.&quot; The conjunctions and were also often used to introduce conditional clauses, which typically contained two components: a main verb in the imperative or subjunctive of command, followed by a secondary statement completed with a verb in the future or future perfect tense. However, scant evidence has been preserved indicating that the present or perfect subjunctive may have also fulfilled this function. One example of a conditional clause without an introductory conjunction appears in the Iguvine tablets, which stipulates &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;if the flamen wishes to make the sacrifice, it is proper.&quot; Jones suggests that the uses of the subjunctive may have extended to invocation, citing another passage from the Iguvine tablets which reads &quot;.&quot; According to Jones, this statement utilizes a subjunctive form of &quot;&quot; to mean &quot;Jupiter Grabovius, I invoke thee.&quot;

==== Participles ====
The Umbrian language contained a present active participle attested in a handful of words, including &quot;&quot; (&quot;sitting&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;standing, stopping&quot;). Umbrian also contained a gerundive, a future passive participle, with forms marked by in contrast to the Latin gerundive marker . Few gerundive Umbrian forms are attested, although the terms &quot;&quot; (&quot;which is to be appeased&quot;), (possibly means &quot;which is to be buried&quot;), and &quot;&quot; (&quot;which is to be carried around&quot;) are known. Perfect passive conjugations in Umbrian were formed via the combination of the perfect passive participle with the present form of the verb &quot;to be.&quot; For instance, the Umbrian perfect passive formation &quot;&quot; (&quot;it has been written&quot;). Likewise, Umbrian future perfect passive conjugations could be formed via the combination of the perfect passive participle with the future form of the verb &quot;to be.&quot; For example, the Umbrian phrase &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;it will have been appeased.&quot; It is also possible that, like in Latin, Umbrian future perfect passive forms could be generated through the combination of the passive participle with the future perfect form of the verb &quot;to be.&quot; Such as feature may be attested in the phrase &quot;,&quot; possibly meaning &quot;it will have arisen.&quot; However, Zair postulates that the term may be alternatively interpreted as an orthographical mistake: the author may have intended to write but began writing , a term which appears in the ensuing sentence. Vittore Pisani, an Italian linguist, suggested the form may have been perfect form marked by the suffix , equivalent to the Latin third-person plural active perfect suffix -, although Zair considers a perfect formation semantically unfeasible given the context of the sentence. Another proposal suggests that the term may have constituted an imperfect subjunctive equivalent to Old Latin , although such a usage of the imperfect subjunctive in the context of the statement is not paralleled in other Italic languages.

==== Endings ====
Verbs in Umbrian are inflected for the following categories:
* Tense (present, imperfect, future, perfect, and future perfect), 
* Voice (active, deponent/passive)
* Mood (indicative, imperative, subjunctive)
* Person (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
* Number (singular, plural)

Present, future and future perfect forms in the active voice use the following set of personal endings (primary):
Imperfect, perfect indicative and all tenses of the subjunctive in the active voice use a different set of endings (secondary):

Passive endings are attested only for the 3rd person: singular primary &quot;-ter&quot;, singular secondary &quot;-(n)tur&quot;, plural &quot;-endi&quot;.

Perfect stems are derived from the present stem in different ways. Latin &quot;-vī-&quot; perfects are not attested in Umbrian. Instead, Umbrian uses its own set of forms, including reduplicated perfects such as &quot;dede&quot; &#x27;gave&#x27;, the -s- suffix, as in &quot;sesu-s-t&quot; &#x27;will have sat&#x27;, and the &quot;-nçi-&quot; suffix, as in &quot;purdi-nçi-ust&quot; &#x27;will have presented&#x27;. Some verbs also use suppletive forms.

Other tenses are formed by suffixation:
The following non-finite forms are attested (all of them are based on the present stem):
==Phonological history==
===Shared changes===
Umbrian shares some phonological changes with its sister language Oscan.

====Labialization of &quot;*kʷ&quot; to &quot;p&quot;====
This change is shared with Umbrian, and so is a common Sabellic change, reminiscent of the k/p split between Goidellic (Irish, etc) and Brythonic (Welsh, etc). piře, &quot;pirse&quot; &quot;what&quot;; Oscan pídum vs Latin &quot;quid.&quot;

====Initial stress and syncope====

At some point early in the history of all Indo-European Italic languages, the accent seems to have shifted to the initial syllable of words as a stress accent, since non-initial syllables are regularly lost or weakened. Since the same pattern occurs in the history of Etruscan, this must be assumed to be an areal feature. (By the time of classical Latin, the accent had shifted in that language to more of an Ancient Greek pattern--on the third syllable from the end (antepenult) unless the last syllable was long, in which case it fell on the second to last syllable (the penult).) The degree to which these shifts can be connected to similar shifts to initial stress in Celtic and Germanic is unclear; for discussion see J. Salmons&#x27; &quot;Accentual Change and Language Contact&quot;. 

Examples: 
Loss of unstressed short -e-: *&quot;onse&quot; &quot;shoulder&quot; &lt; *&quot;omesei&quot;, compare Latin &quot;umerus&quot;; &quot;destre&quot; &quot;on the right&quot; &lt; *&quot;deksiterer&quot;; &quot;ostendu&quot; &quot;present&quot; (imperative) &lt; *&quot;obs-tendetōd&quot;, compare Latin &quot;ostendito&quot;.

===Innovations unique to Umbrian (or not shared with Oscan)===
But compared to its highly conservative sister language Oscan, Umbrian exhibits a number of innovations, some of them shared by its neighbor to the west, Latin. (Below, following convention, bold text for Umbrian and Oscan indicates words written in the native, Etruscan derived script, while &quot;italics&quot; represents words written in Latin-derived script.)

====Treatment of original diphthongs====
All diphthongs are simplified into monophthongs, a process only partly seen in Latin, and only very rarely in Oscan. So Proto-Italic *&quot;ai&quot; and *&quot;ei&quot; become Umbrian low &quot;ē&quot;: kvestur : Oscan kvaísstur, Latin &quot;quaestor&quot; &#x27;official in charge of public revenue and expenditure&#x27;; prever &#x27;single&#x27; : Oscan &quot;preivatud&quot;, Latin &quot;prīvus&quot;; furthermore, Proto-Italic *&quot;oi&quot;, *&quot;ou&quot; and *&quot;au&quot; become &quot;ō&quot; (written u in the native script) in initial syllables: unu &#x27;one&#x27; : Old Latin &quot;oinus&quot;; ute &#x27;or&#x27; : Oscan &quot;auti&quot;, Latin &quot;aut&quot;; tuta &#x27;city&#x27; : Oscan &quot;touto&quot;.

====Palatalization of velars====
Velars are palatalized and spirantized before front vowels and the front glide /j/ to probably a palatalized sibilant (perhaps the postalveolar /ʃ/), written ç, &quot;ś&quot; or simply &quot;s&quot;. (A similar change happened later in most Romance languages.) For example: Umbrian &quot;śesna&quot; &#x27;dinner&#x27; : Oscan kersnu, Latin &quot;cēna&quot;; Umbrian façiu &#x27;I do, I make&#x27; : Latin &quot;faciō&quot;. 

====Rhotacism====
Like Latin, but unlike Oscan, intervocalic -s- rhotacized to -r- in Umbrian. In late forms of the language, final -s also becomes -r (a change not seen in Latin). For example, the genitive plural ending of -ā stems: Umbrian &quot;-arum&quot;, Latin &quot;-arum&quot; vs Oscan -asúm (compare Sanskrit -&quot;āsām&quot;). 

====Treatment of *&quot;d&quot;====

While initial *&quot;d-&quot; is preserved (spelled t in the native alphabet), earlier intervocalic *-d- (and sometimes *-l-) show up in the native alphabet as a character generally transliterated as ř, but as the sequence &quot;rs&quot; in Umbrian texts using the Latin alphabet. The exact pronunciation is unknown: piře, &quot;pirse&quot; &quot;what&quot; vs. Oscan pídum, Latin &quot;quid.&quot;
====Vowels====
Proto-italic &quot;*ū&quot; became /i/, sim (accusative singular) &lt;PI &quot;*sūm&quot; &quot;pig&quot;

They are based on the earlier Motorola 56000 and remain software compatible with them, but have been updated to a full single-precision (32-bit) floating point implementation that is compliant with the IEEE 754-1985 standard.

Many of the design features of the 96000 remain similar to the 56000. In architectures 96000, the stack area is allocated in a separate address space, which is called &quot;Stack Memory Space&quot;, distinct from the main memory address space. The stack, which is used when subroutine calls and &quot;long interrupt&quot;s, is fifteen in depth. While the 56000 is equipped with two 56-bit accumulators, each of which can be partitioned into one 8-bit extension register and two 24-bit registers, the 96000 is equipped with ten 96-bit registers, each of which can be partitioned into three 32-bit sub-registers.

Unlike the 56K, the 96000 &quot;family&quot; consisted of a single model, the 96002. It was nowhere near as successful as the 56K, and was only produced for a short period of time. Today its role is filled by products based on the so-called Motorola StarCore.

The 96000 offers an Assembler and an Instruction set simulator as part of its development tool.

<text>Samuel Serrano (born November 17, 1952) is a Puerto Rican former professional boxer who competed from 1969 to 1984 and made a two-fight comeback from 1996 to 1997. He was a two-time super featherweight world champion, having held the WBA title twice between 1976 and 1983.

According to Serrano during a 2017 interview with El Nuevo Dia newspaper, he learned to box starting at age 5 when he lived at Palmarejos barrio in Corozal.

==Professional boxing career==

Serrano, owner of long arms, began his career on October 29, 1969, with a third-round knockout win over Ramon Laureano. He built a fan base in Puerto Rico, campaigning there for his first 23 bouts, including winning and losing the Puerto Rican Featherweight title v.s Francisco Villegas. For his 24th bout, he traveled to Panama City, where he met future world Featherweight champion Ernesto Marcel, who beat him on points in 10 rounds. That would be his last defeat in a long time.

He then continued his winning ways, including a 10-round decision win over tough veteran Cocoa Perez and one win over future title challenger Diego Alcala of Panama, also by decision in 10. Serrano then travelled in 1976 to Honolulu, Hawaii, to meet reigning Lineal and WBA world jr. Lightweight champion, the Filipino Ben Villaflor. By most writer&#x27;s accounts, Serrano beat Villaflor, but he had to return home only with a 15-round draw (tie).

The WBA ordered an immediate rematch, and so on October 16 of the same year, Villaflor went to San Juan to defend his title for the second time vs. Serrano. Serrano beat Villaflor by using his ring technique to win 12 of the 15 rounds on each judges&#x27; scorecards. As life had it, Samuel Serrano was destined to become a world champion in front of his fans.

Serrano became a traveling champion, defending his title in places like Venezuela, Ecuador, South Africa, Japan (twice) and, of course, Puerto Rico. One of his defenses, against Julio &quot;Diablito&quot; Valdez, resulted in an after-fight brawl when Serrano was announced as winner by a unanimous decision and went to greet his rival but was received with a punch to the face. Serrano retaliated, and police intervention was needed. Both fighters were escorted to their dressing rooms by the police. But disaster struck for Serrano in Detroit on August 2 of 1980, when, after leading on all scorecards, he was struck by a Yasutsune Uehara right hand to the chin in round six, and lost his title by knockout to the Japanese. After that loss, he set his eyes on recovering his world title from the Japanese world champion, and so on April 9, 1981, they met again, this time in Wakayama, Japan. Serrano was more cautious this time, and didn&#x27;t try to go for the knockout after building a points lead. Even though Uehara was fighting in his homeland, all judges agreed and gave Serrano more rounds than they gave Uehara, and Serrano the world title back by a fifteen-round unanimous decision.

Serrano made two defenses and then went to Chile to give challenger Benedicto Villablanca a chance at the title on June 3, 1982. It proved to be a highly controversial fight. After 5 rounds, Serrano was ahead on the scorecards. However, a cut appeared over his eye during the 6th, and the referee ruled it to be from a punch. Serrano kept fighting, but during the 11th round, the cut was so deep, the fight had to be stopped by the doctor and Serrano had to be taken to a Santiago hospital. Since the referee ruled the cut came from a punch, initially the fight and the world title were given to Villablanca.

Serrano and his corner filed a complaint, however, claiming the cut had been caused by a headbutt instead, and upon review at the WBA&#x27;s Panama City offices, WBA officials announced they had effectively seen the headbutt that Serrano claimed opened his cut happen. So the WBA decided the cut had come from a headbutt, and the judges&#x27; scorecards were reviewed. They had Serrano ahead on points after 10 rounds, so the fight, and the crown, were given back to Serrano by a technical decision.

In his next defense he met the younger and physically stronger Roger Mayweather. Serrano and Mayweather gave it a good fight for most of 7 rounds, but Serrano was weakened by a barrage of punches towards the end of the 7th, and downed with a right hand in the 8th, this time, losing the title definitively.

==Retirement==
Serrano retired from the ring for one year and came back in 1984, winning by first round knockout. Then, he retired again.

In 1996, Serrano won the Puerto Rican Lightweight title vs Sammy Mejias on a 12-round decision, and he also won a 10-round decision vs Anthony Ivory in 1997. Serrano retired after the Ivory fight with a final record of 50 wins, 5 defeats and 17 knockouts.

He made a television commercial for Budweiser in Puerto Rico in 1982. 
As of 2017, Serrano was living in a beach house at Islote, ciudad de Arecibo. He dedicated himself to fixing beachfront apartments and renting them, as well as to creating mosaic art, some of which he sold.

<text>Hansard is the transcripts of parliamentary debates in Britain and many Commonwealth countries. It is named after Thomas Curson Hansard (1776–1833), a London printer and publisher, who was the first official printer to the Parliament at Westminster.

==Origins==
Though the history of the &quot;Hansard&quot; began in the British Parliament, each of Britain&#x27;s colonies developed a separate and distinctive history. Before 1771, the British Parliament had long been a highly secretive body. The official record of the actions of the House was publicly available but there was no record of the debates. The publication of remarks made in the House became a breach of parliamentary privilege, punishable by the two Houses of Parliament. As the populace became interested in parliamentary debates, more independent newspapers began publishing unofficial accounts of them. The many penalties implemented by the government, including fines, dismissal, imprisonment, and investigations, are reflective of &quot;the difficulties faced by independent newspapermen who took an interest in the development of Upper Canada, and who, in varying degrees, attempted to educate the populace to the shortcomings of their rulers&quot;.

Several editors used the device of reporting on parliamentary debates under the veil of debates of fictitious societies or bodies. The names under which parliamentary debates were published include &quot;Proceedings of the Lower Room of the Robin Hood Society&quot; and &quot;Debates of the Senate of Magna Lilliputia&quot;. The Senate of Magna Lilliputia was printed in Edward Cave&#x27;s &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which was first published in 1732. The names of the speakers were carefully &quot;filleted&quot;; for example, Sir Robert Walpole was thinly disguised as &quot;Sr. R―t W―le&quot;.

In 1771, Brass Crosby, who was Lord Mayor of the City of London, had brought before him a printer by the name of John Miller who dared publish reports of parliamentary proceedings. He released the man, but was subsequently ordered to appear before the House to explain his actions. Crosby was committed to the Tower of London, but when he was brought to trial, several judges refused to hear the case and after protests from the public, Crosby was released. Parliament ceased to punish the publishing of its debates as harshly, partly due to the campaigns of John Wilkes on behalf of free speech. There then began several attempts to publish reports of debates. Among the early successes, the &quot;Parliamentary Register&quot; published by John Almon and John Debrett began in 1775 and ran until 1813.

William Cobbett (1763–1835), a noted radical and publisher, began publishing &quot;Parliamentary Debates&quot; as a supplement to his &quot;Political Register&quot; in 1802, eventually extending his reach back with the &quot;Parliamentary History&quot;. Cobbett&#x27;s avocation for the freedom of the press was severely punished by the British Government. On 5 June 1810 William Cobbett stood trial for seditious libel for an article he wrote against the British Government which was published by Thomas Curson Hansard. Cobbett was found &quot;guilty, upon the fullest and most satisfactory evidence&quot;. The court sentence read: &quot;The court do adjudge that you, William Cobbett pay to our Lord the King a fine of £1000; that you be imprisoned in His Majesty&#x27;s gaol of Newgate for the space of two years, and that at expiration of that time you enter into a recognizance to keep the peace for seven years—yourself in the sum of £3000, and two good and sufficient sureties in the sum of £1,000; and further, that you be imprisoned till that recognizance be entered into, and that fine paid&quot;. The sentence was described by J. C. Trewin as &quot;vindictive&quot;. The Court argued that Thomas Curson Hansard, who had &quot;seen the copy before it was printed, ought not to have suffered it to have been printed at all&quot; and was sentenced to three months imprisonment in the King&#x27;s Bench Prison.

Cobbett&#x27;s reports were printed by Thomas Curson Hansard from 1809; in 1812, Cobbett&#x27;s finances ran asunder and he divested himself of his proprietorship of both the &quot;Parliamentary Debates&quot; and &quot;Parliamentary History&quot;, which then &quot;passed into the hands of Hansard in 1812&quot;. &quot;Cobbett&#x27;s Parliamentary Debates&quot; became &quot;Hansard Parliamentary Debates&quot;, &quot;abbreviated over time to the now familiar Hansard&quot;. From 1829 the name &quot;Hansard&quot; appeared on the title page of each issue. Cobbett and Hansard did not ever employ anyone to take down notes of the debates, which were taken from a multiplicity of sources in the morning newspapers. For this reason, early editions of &quot;Hansard&quot; are not to be absolutely relied upon as a guide to everything discussed in Parliament.

Hansard outlasted competitors including Almon and Debrett, and the later &quot;Mirror of Parliament&quot; published by J. H. Barrow from 1828 to 1843; Barrow&#x27;s work was more comprehensive but he checked each speech with the Member and allowed them to correct anything they wished they had not said. The last attempt at a commercial rival was &quot;The Times&quot; which published debates in the 1880s. In 1878, a subsidy was granted to the Hansard press and at that point reporters were employed. Despite hiring contract reporters there were still widespread complaints about the accuracy of the debate reports. In 1889, Henry Hansard, the son of Thomas Hansard, broke the family connection with the debates.

==United Kingdom==

The &quot;Hansard&quot; of today, a comprehensive account of every speech, began in 1909 when Parliament took over the publication and established its own staff of official &quot;Hansard&quot; reporters. At the same time, the decision was made to publish debates of the two houses in separate volumes, and to change the front cover from orange-red to light blue. A larger page format was introduced with new technology in 1980.

&quot;Hansard&quot; is not a word-for-word transcript of debates in Parliament. Its terms of reference are those set by a House of Commons select committee in 1893, as being a report which, though not strictly verbatim, is substantially the verbatim report with repetitions and redundancies omitted and with obvious mistakes (including grammatical mistakes) corrected, but which, on the other hand, leaves out nothing that adds to the meaning of the speech or illustrates the argument.

One instance of such an eliminated redundancy involves the calling of MPs to speak in the House of Commons. In that house, the Speaker must call on an MP by name before that member may speak, but &quot;Hansard&quot; makes no mention of the recognition accorded by the Speaker. Also, &quot;Hansard&quot; sometimes adds extraneous material to make the remarks less ambiguous. For example, though members refer to each other as &quot;the hon. Member for &quot;Constituency Name&quot; rather than by name, &quot;Hansard&quot; adds, in parentheses, the name of the MP being referred to, the first time that MP is referred to in a speech or debate. When an MP simply points at another whose constituency he or she cannot remember, &quot;Hansard&quot; identifies him or her.

Any interruption to debate will be marked with the word &quot;(Interruption)&quot;. This understated phrase covers a variety of situations, ranging from members laughing uproariously to the physical invasion of the chamber. Interjections from seated members, such as heckling during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, are generally only included if the member who is speaking responds to the interjection.

&quot;Hansard&quot; also publishes written answers – known as written ministerial statements – made by government ministers in response to questions formally posed by members. In 1839, Hansard, by order of the House of Commons, printed and published a report stating that an indecent book published by a Mr. Stockdale was circulating in Newgate Prison. Stockdale sued for defamation but Hansard&#x27;s defence, that the statement was true, succeeded. On publication of a reprint, Stockdale sued again but Hansard was ordered by the House to plead that he had acted under order of the Commons and was protected by parliamentary privilege. In the resulting case of &quot;Stockdale v Hansard&quot;, the court found that the house held no privilege to order publication of defamatory material. In consequence, Parliament passed the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 to establish privilege for publications under the house&#x27;s authority.

Since 1909, and for important votes before then, &quot;Hansard&quot; has listed how members have voted in divisions. Furthermore, the proceedings and debates in committee are also published in separate volumes. For many years the House of Commons &quot;Hansard&quot; did not formally acknowledge the existence of parties in the House, except obliquely, with MPs&#x27; references to other MPs of the same party as &quot;hon. Friends&quot;, but in 2003 this changed and members&#x27; party affiliations are now identified. The &quot;Hansard&quot; of the House of Lords operates entirely independently of its Commons counterpart, but with similar terms of reference. It covers parliamentary business in the House of Lords chamber itself, as well as the debates in the Moses Room, known as Grand Committee. Parliamentary written answers and statements are also printed. Emma Crewe notes that &quot;Editors view reporters in general as a hive of revolution and anti-establishment attitudes, while they perceive themselves as calm and uncomplaining&quot;. The Internet, with the help of volunteers, has made the UK &quot;Hansard&quot; more accessible. The UK &quot;Hansard&quot; is currently being digitised to a high-level format for on-line publication. It is possible to review and search the UK &quot;Hansard&quot; from 1803, with the exception of standing committees.

Because &quot;Hansard&quot; is treated as accurate, there is a parliamentary convention whereby if a member of Parliament makes an inaccurate statement in Parliament, they must write a correction in the copy of &quot;Hansard&quot; kept in the House of Commons library.

In 2010, historic copies of &quot;Hansard&quot; were sent to India in its original volume format and was transformed from the original bound versions into plain text by optical character recognition (OCR) and put on the Internet to enable easy research. In July 2018 this digitised &quot;Hansard&quot; was vastly improved and merged with the rest of &quot;Hansard&quot; as previously it was available under two websites and now it is a single website. There are still many &#x27;typos&#x27; from the OCR process but readers are encouraged to report them when they are spotted.

==Canada==

===House of Commons===
As with the Westminster &quot;Hansard&quot;, the Canadian version is not strictly verbatim, and is guided by the principle of avoiding &quot;repetitions, redundancies and obvious errors&quot;. Unlike the UK House of Commons, members are referred to in the House only by the parliamentary ridings they represent (&quot;The member for Richmond Hill&quot;, etc.) or by their cabinet post. &quot;Hansard&quot; supplies an affiliation the first time each member speaks in the House on a particular day—&quot;Mr. Mathieu Ravignat (Pontiac, NDP)&quot; or &quot;Hon. Lynne Yelich (Minister of State for Western Economic Diversification, CPC)&quot;—and by name only when they rise later to speak.

If interjections give rise to a call for order by the Speaker, they are reported as &quot;Some hon. members: Oh, oh!&quot; The details of the approval or negativing of motions and bills are reported in rather baroque detail:

===Translation===
Given the bilingual nature of the Canadian federal government, two equivalent Canadian &quot;Hansard&quot;s are maintained, one in French and one in English. This makes it a natural parallel text, and it is often used to train French–English machine translation programs. In addition to being already translated and aligned, the size of the &quot;Hansard&quot;s and the fact that new material is always being added makes it an attractive corpus. However, its usefulness is hindered by the fact that the translations, although accurate in meaning, are not always literally exact.

The Canadian &quot;Hansard&quot; records make note of the language used by the members of parliament, so as not to misinterpret the words of the person who has the floor. If the member speaks in French, the English &quot;Hansard&quot; records would state that the member spoke in French and refer the reader to the French &quot;Hansard&quot; record.

In one instance, during a Liberal filibuster in the Senate of Canada, Senator Philippe Gigantès was accused of reading one of his books only so that he could get the translation for free through the &quot;Hansard&quot;.

===Newfoundland===
In Newfoundland the struggle for the free press was much more violent. Henry Winton, editor of &quot;Saint John&#x27;s Ledger&quot;, &quot;had his ears cut off and was left unconscious by thugs who had been lying in wait for him after dark&quot;. The fate of Winton was to be his printer&#x27;s as well. 
The Authorities, who were not on friendly terms with the &quot;Ledger&quot;, made little to no effort to apprehend the culprits. In another case, a &quot;Gentleman by the name Parsons&quot;, of the &quot;Newfoundland Patriot&quot;, &quot;was sentenced to three months imprisonment in another incident&quot;.

===Nova Scotia===
As was the case in many early Canadian regions, the newspapers were the first source of the parliamentary debates. Canada&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Halifax Gazette&quot;, was printed on Grafton street in Halifax in 1752. The two most prominent papers in parliamentary reporting were the &quot;Acadian Recorder&quot;, founded in 1813 by Anthony Henry Holland, and the &quot;Free Press&quot;, established in 1816 by Edward Ward. Both newspapers reported the debates of the House of Assembly starting in 1817.

The Family Compact of Nova Scotia, nicknamed &quot;the little compact&quot;, &quot;viewed the admission of reporters to the Assembly with disdain&quot; and &quot;were not slow to react whenever they felt the slightest affront&quot;. There are many cases which exemplify the &quot;struggle to obtain freedom of the press and parliamentary reportings in the Maritimes&quot; as in the case of William Minns in 1823, who was forced to appear before the bar of the house, and William Milne, who was jailed for not being able to pay his debts.

&quot;The Novascotian&quot; newspaper would soon become Nova Scotia&#x27;s most prominent paper after its launch in 1824, which was highly influenced by George Young who was instrumental in its establishment. George Young sought permission from the Assembly to report its debates. Permission was granted, yet he was not provided with very many privileges in the House. They did not make it easy for him and did not allow him a seat in the lower deck.

In 1827, Joseph Howe bought the &quot;Novascotian&quot; from Young. &quot;There was no more powerful an advocate of parliamentary debates than Howe&quot;. In 1835 Joseph Howe was &quot;prosecuted over a publication of a letter in the &quot;Novascotian&quot;&quot;. He was charged with libel. This case was infamous and is considered to be a &quot;cornerstone in the establishment of freedom of the press in Canada&quot;. Howe, who defended himself in court, was found to be Not Guilty. This is why his case is viewed as a milestone in the development of the free press.

===Ontario===

No official record of the debates in the provincial Legislature was produced before 1944. The debates were reported in various newspapers; the provincial archives clipped and collected these reports in a series of scrapbooks until 1953. The provincial website now posts &quot;Hansard&quot; online, with records from March 29, 1977, to current.

===Alberta===
Alberta adopted a &quot;Hansard&quot; in 1972. From 1905 to 1971, local newspapers reported on legislative proceedings, and from these articles the Legislature Library has compiled a Scrapbook &quot;Hansard&quot;, which is available online. News reporters were allowed to take handwritten notes in the Chamber, but they could not make sound recordings, and members of the public were not allowed to take notes.

In 1965 a recording system was installed in the Chamber. Initially the Clerk&#x27;s office provided transcription only for special events, such as throne speeches, but requests from MLAs for transcripts increased, and by 1971 all House proceedings were being recorded. On March 8, 1972, the government introduced a motion to create &quot;Alberta Hansard&quot;, and the following day they brought forward a motion allowing audio and video recording in the Chamber and also permitting visitors to the galleries to take notes. Assembly standing orders 115 and 116 set out the rules for broadcast media in the Chamber and at committee meetings, respectively.

&quot;Hansard&quot; staff verifies the names of individuals and entities mentioned in the House. Like other &quot;Hansard&quot;s, &quot;Alberta Hansard&quot; follows editorial guidelines established in the 19th century, and transcripts are substantially verbatim. Revisions are limited to &quot;the correction of grammar, spelling and punctuation, ensuring that the correct parliamentary forms are observed, and minimizing superfluous repetition and redundancies, but no material alterations shall be made, nor any amendments that would in any way tend to change the sense of what has been spoken.&quot;

Transcripts for Legislative Assembly of Alberta proceedings from 1972 onward are available online, and current issues are usually posted within 12 hours of the day&#x27;s sitting. A transcript for a regular afternoon Assembly sitting of 4.5 hours contains more than 30,000 words. Also available online are transcripts for meetings of committees of the Legislative Assembly from the 1990s onward, earlier for some committees.

===British Columbia===

No complete official record of the debates in the British Columbia Legislature was produced until 1972; a partial record was issued beginning in 1970. As with Ontario, various newspapers reported on the proceedings, which can be found in the Legislative Assembly Sessional Clippings Books, provided by the University of Victoria Unlike the Ottawa &quot;Hansard&quot;, opposition members and government backbenchers are identified only by initial and last name: &quot;A. Wilkinson&quot;. Current cabinet ministers have their names prefaced with &quot;Honourable&quot;: &quot;Hon. S. Hagen&quot;. Interjections giving rise to a call for order by the Speaker are reported only as &quot;Interjection&quot;. Other interjections are reported as spoken if they are clearly audible and if they are responded to in some way by the member who has the floor. While the details of approval or negativing of motions and bills closely parallel the House of Commons, the reporting is simplified to a style line (&quot;Motion approved&quot; or &quot;Motion negatived&quot;).

==Australia==
The Parliament of Australia also keeps record of debates, using the term &quot;Hansard&quot;. The records are published by the State Law Publisher. The Parliament of South Australia was the first Australian parliament to use &quot;Hansard&quot;; where it became a convention from 1857. 

The Parliament of Victoria followed the lead of South Australia by introducing the use of &quot;Hansard&quot; in 1866. The Parliament of New South Wales commenced its &quot;Hansard&quot; system on 28 October 1879 with the reporting of the Legislative Council at the opening of the Third Session of the Ninth Parliament. In Tasmania, &quot;Hansard&quot; was not introduced until 1979, commencing on 6 June for the Legislative Council and 12 June for the House of Assembly.

==New Zealand==

On 9 July 1867, a team of five reporters, led by Chief Reporter C.C.N. Barron, produced the first official report of debates of the New Zealand Parliament. Ever since that day official transcripts of members&#x27; speeches in the New Zealand House of Representatives have been continuously published.

Today the New Zealand &quot;Hansard&quot; is produced by a team of 17 FTE Hansard Editors within the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives. &quot;Hansard&quot; is published on the New Zealand Parliament website each day the House sits, and later indexed bound volumes are produced.

Speeches are transcribed directly from digital recordings of the debate, with staff present in the debating chamber to monitor the debate by recording the sequence of speakers and any interjections. Interjections are reported only if the member speaking replies to them or remarks on them during the course of his or her speech. Hansard Editors follow strict rules on what changes they can make to the words members use in the chamber. &quot;Hansard&quot; is as close to as possible, although Hansard Editors remove repetitions and redundancies and make minor grammatical corrections. Members are provided draft copies of their speeches at the same time that the speeches are first published on the Parliament website. Members can request correction of inadvertent factual inaccuracies but they are unable to significantly change what they said in the House.

<doc id="102328" wikidata="Q147085" url="?curid=102328" title="Anatolian languages">
<text>The Anatolian languages are an extinct branch of Indo-European languages that were spoken in Anatolia. The best known Anatolian language is Hittite, which is considered the earliest-attested Indo-European language.

Undiscovered until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they are often believed to be the earliest branch to have split from the Proto Indo-European family. Once discovered, the presence of laryngeal consonants &quot;ḫ&quot; and &quot;ḫḫ&quot; in Hittite and Luwian provided support for the laryngeal theory of Proto-Indo-European linguistics. While Hittite attestation ends after the Bronze Age, hieroglyphic Luwian survived until the conquest of the Neo-Hittite kingdoms by the Semitic Assyrian Empire, and alphabetic inscriptions in Anatolian languages are fragmentarily attested until the early first millennium AD, eventually succumbing to the Hellenization of Anatolia as a result of Greek colonisation.

== Origins ==

The Anatolian branch is often considered the earliest to have split from the Proto-Indo-European language, from a stage referred to either as Indo-Hittite or &quot;Archaic PIE&quot;; typically a date in the mid-4th millennium BC is assumed for the evolution of this branch, followed by a migration into Anatolia in the early 2nd millenium BC. Under the Kurgan hypothesis, there are two possibilities for how the early Anatolian speakers could have reached Anatolia: from the north via the Caucasus, or from the west, via the Balkans; the latter is considered somewhat more likely by Mallory (1989), Steiner (1990), and Anthony (2007). Statistical research by Quentin Atkinson and others using Bayesian inference and glottochronological markers favors an Indo-European origin in Anatolia, though the method&#x27;s validity and accuracy are subject to debate, and this is a minority view concerning the urheimat of PIE.

It has been theorized that Cernavodă culture, together with the Sredny Stog culture, was the source of Anatolian languages and introduced them to Anatolia through the Balkans after Anatolian split from the Proto-Indo-Anatolian language, which some linguists and archaeologists place in the area of the Sredny Stog culture. Petra Goedegebuure suggests Anatolian separated from PIE in the north by 4500 BC and had arrived in Anatolia by about 2500 -2000 BC, via a migration route through the Caucasus.

== Classification ==
Melchert (2012) has proposed the following classification:
* Proto-Anatolian
** Hittite
** Luwic
*** Luwian
*** Carian
*** Milyan
*** Lycian
*** Sidetic
*** Pisidian
** Palaic
** Lydian
Kloekhorst (2022) has proposed a more detailed classification, with estimated dating for some of the reconstructed stages:
* Proto-Anatolian (diverged around the 31st century BC)
** Proto-Luwo-Lydian
*** Proto-Luwo-Palaic
**** Proto-Luwic (–20th century BC)
***** Proto-Luwian ()
****** Cuneiform Luwian (16th–15th century BC)
****** Hieroglyphic Luwian (13th–8th century BC)
***** Proto-Lyco-Carian
****** Proto-Carian–Milyan
******* Carian (7th–3rd century BC)
******* Milyan (5th century BC)
****** Proto-Lycian–Sidetic
******* Lycian (5th–4th century BC)
******* Sidetic (5th–2nd century BC)
***** Pisidian (1st–2nd century AD) [unclassified]
**** Proto-Palaic
***** Palaic (16th–15th century BC)
*** Proto-Lydian
**** Lydian (8th–3rd century BC)
** Proto-Hittite ()
*** Kanišite Hittite (–1710 BC)
*** Ḫattuša Hittite (–1180 BC)
In addition, the recently discovered Kalašma language is believed to be a Luwic language, though further analysis has yet to be published.

== Features ==
=== Phonology ===
The phonology of the Anatolian languages preserves distinctions lost in its sister branches of Indo-European. Famously, the Anatolian languages retain the PIE laryngeals in words such as Hittite (cf. Ancient Greek , Lithuanian , Old Norse , PIE &#x27;) and Lycian (cf. Latin , Old Prussian , Archaic Irish (), PIE &#x27;). The three dorsal consonant series of PIE also remained distinct in Proto-Anatolian and have different reflexes in the Luwic languages, e.g. Luwian where &#x27; &gt; , &#x27; &gt; , and &#x27; &gt; &quot;.&quot; The three-way distinction in Proto-Indo-European stops (i.e. , , ) collapsed into a fortis-lenis distinction in Proto-Anatolian, conventionally written as &#x27; vs. . In Hittite and Luwian cuneiform, the lenis stops were written as single voiceless consonants while the fortis stops were written as doubled voiceless, indicating a geminated pronunciation. By the first millennium, the lenis consonants seem to have been spirantized in Lydian, Lycian, and Carian.

The Proto-Anatolian laryngeal consonant *H patterned with the stops in fortition and lenition and appears as geminated or plain in cuneiform. Reflexes of *H in Hittite are interpreted as pharyngeal fricatives and those in Luwian as uvular fricatives based on loans in Ugaritic and Egyptian, as well as vowel-coloring effects. The laryngeals were lost in Lydian but became Lycian () and Carian (), both pronounced [k], as well as labiovelars —Lycian (), Carian ()—when labialized. Suggestions for their realization in Proto-Anatolian include pharyngeal fricatives, uvular fricatives, or uvular stops.

=== Verbs ===
Anatolian morphology is considerably simpler than other early Indo-European (IE) languages. The verbal system distinguishes only two tenses (present-future and preterite), two voices (active and mediopassive), and two moods (indicative and imperative), lacking the subjunctive and optative moods found in other old IE languages like Tocharian, Sanskrit, and Ancient Greek. Anatolian verbs are also typically divided into two conjugations: the conjugation and conjugation, named for their first-person singular present indicative suffix in Hittite. While the conjugation has clear cognates outside of Anatolia, the conjugation is distinctive and appears to be derived from a reduplicated or intensive form in PIE.

=== Gender ===
The Anatolian gender system is based on two classes: animate and inanimate (also termed common and neuter). Proto-Anatolian almost certainly did not inherit a separate feminine agreement class from PIE. The two-gender system has been described as a merger of masculine and feminine genders following the phonetic merger of PIE a-stems with o-stems. However the discovery of a group of inherited nouns with suffix &#x27; in Lycian and therefore Proto-Anatolian raised doubts about the existence of a feminine gender in PIE. The feminine gender typically marked with in non-Anatolian Indo-European languages may be connected to a derivational suffix &#x27;, attested for abstract nouns and collectives in Anatolian. The appurtenance suffix is scarce in Anatolian but fully productive as a feminine marker in Tocharian. This suggests the Anatolian gender system is the original for IE, while the feminine-masculine-neuter classification of Tocharian + Core IE languages may have arisen following a sex-based split within the class of topical nouns to provide more precise reference tracking for male and female humans.

=== Case ===
Proto-Anatolian retained the nominal case system of Proto-Indo-European, including the vocative, nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, genitive, and locative cases, and innovated an additional allative case. Nouns distinguish singular and plural numbers, as well as a collective plural for inanimates in Old Hittite and remnant dual forms for natural pairs. The Anatolian branch also has a split-ergative system based on gender, with inanimate nouns being marked in the ergative case when the subject of a transitive verb. This may be an areal influence from nearby non-IE ergative languages like Hurrian.

=== Syntax ===
The basic word order in Anatolian is subject-object-verb except for Lycian, where verbs typically precede objects. Clause-initial particles are a striking feature of Anatolian syntax; in a given sentence, a connective or the first accented word usually hosts a chain of clitics in Wackernagel&#x27;s position. Enclitic pronouns, discourse markers, conjunctions, and local or modal particles appear in rigidly ordered slots. Words fronted before the particle chain are topicalized.

== Languages ==
The list below gives the Anatolian languages in a relatively flat arrangement, following a summary of the Anatolian family tree by Robert Beekes (2010). This model recognizes only one clear subgroup, the Luwic languages. Modifications and updates of the branching order continue, however. A second version opposes Hittite to Western Anatolian, and divides the latter node into Lydian, Palaic, and a Luwian group (instead of Luwic).

=== Hittite ===

Hittite (&quot;nešili&quot;) was the language of the Hittite Empire, dated approximately 1650–1200 BC, which ruled over nearly all of Anatolia during that time. The earliest sources of Hittite are the 19th century BC Kültepe texts, the Semitic Akkadian language records of the &quot;kârum kaneš&quot;, or &quot;port of Kanes,&quot; an Assyrian trading colony within the city of Kanesh (Kültepe). This collection records Hittite names and words loaned into Akkadian (Old Assyrian) from Hittite. Other such examples are found in other Assyrian Karums in Southeast Anatolia. The Hittite name for the city was &quot;Neša&quot;, from which the Hittite endonym for the language, &quot;Nešili&quot;, was derived. The fact that the enclave was Assyrian, rather than Hittite, and that the city name became the language name, suggest that the Hittite language was already in a position of influence, perhaps dominance, in central Anatolia.

The main cache of Hittite texts is the approximately 30,000 clay tablet fragments, of which only some have been studied, from the records of the royal city of &quot;Hattuša&quot;, located on a ridge near what is now Boğazkale, Turkey (formerly named Boğazköy). The records show a gradual rise to power of the Anatolian language speakers over the native language isolate speaking Hattians, until at last the kingship became an Anatolian privilege. From then on, little is heard of the Hattians, but the Hittites kept the name. The records include rituals, medical writings, letters, laws and other public documents, making possible an in-depth knowledge of many aspects of the civilization.

Most of the records are dated to the 13th century BC (Late Bronze Age). They are written in cuneiform script borrowing heavily from the Mesopotamian system of writing of nearby Assyria. The script is a syllabary. This fact, combined with frequent use of Akkadian and Sumerian words, as well as logograms, or signs representing whole words, to represent lexical items, often introduces considerable uncertainty as to the form of the original. However, phonetic syllable signs are present also, representing syllables of the form V, CV, VC, CVC, where V is &quot;vowel&quot; and C is &quot;consonant&quot;.

Hittite is divided into Old, Middle, and New (or Neo-). The dates are somewhat variable. They are based on an approximate coincidence of historical periods and variants of the writing system: the Old Kingdom and the Old Script, the Middle Kingdom and the Middle Script, and the New Kingdom and the New Script. Fortson gives the dates, which come from the reigns of the relevant kings, as 1570–1450 BC, 1450–1380 BC, and 1350–1200 BC respectively. These are not glottochronologic. 

All cuneiform Hittite came to an end at the end of the 13th century BC during the Bronze Age Collapse, with the destruction of Hattusas and the end of the empire, much of it having been annexed by the Middle Assyrian Empire over the preceeding century and the capital and its surrounds sacked by the Phrygians in 1200 BC.

=== Palaic ===

Palaic, spoken in the north-central Anatolian region of Palā (later Paphlagonia), extinct around the 13th century BC, is known only from fragments of quoted prayers in Old Hittite texts. It was extinguished by the replacement of the culture, if not the population, as a result of an invasion by the Kaskas, which the Hittites could not prevent.

=== Luwic branch ===

The term &quot;Luwic&quot; was proposed by Craig Melchert as the node of a branch to include several languages that seem more closely related than the other Anatolian languages. This is not a neologism, as &quot;Luvic&quot; had been used in the early 20th century to mean the Anatolian language group as a whole, or languages identified as Luvian by the Hittite texts. The name comes from Hittite (). The earlier use of &quot;Luvic&quot; fell into disuse in favour of &quot;Luvian&quot;. Meanwhile, most of the languages now termed Luvian, or Luvic, were not known to be so until the latter 20th century. Even more fragmentary attestations might be discovered in the future.

&quot;Luvian&quot; and &quot;Luvic&quot; have other meanings in English, so currently &quot;Luwian&quot; and &quot;Luwic&quot; are preferred. Before the term &quot;Luwic&quot; was proposed for Luwian and its closest relatives, scholars used the term &quot;Luwian&quot; in the sense of &#x27;Luwic languages&#x27;. For example, Silvia Luraghi&#x27;s Luwian branch begins with a root language she terms the &quot;Luwian group&quot;, which logically is in the place of Common Luwian or Proto-Luwian. Its three offsprings, according to her are Milyan, Proto-Luwian, and Lycian, while Proto-Luwian branches into Cuneiform and Hieroglyphic Luwian.

==== Luwian ====
The Luwian language is attested in two different scripts, cuneiform and Anatolian hieroglyphs, over more than a millennium. While the earlier scholarship tended to treat these two corpora as separate linguistic entities, the current tendency is to separate genuine dialectal distinctions within Luwian from orthographic differences. Accordingly, one now frequently speaks of Kizzuwatna Luwian (attested in cuneiform transmission), Empire Luwian (cuneiform and hieroglyphic transmission), and Iron Age Luwian / Late Luwian (hieroglyphic transmission), as well as several more Luwian dialects, which are more scarcely attested.

The cuneiform corpus (Melchert&#x27;s CLuwian) is recorded in glosses and short passages in Hittite texts, mainly from Boğazkale. About 200 tablet fragments of the approximately 30,000 contain CLuwian passages. Most of the tablets reflect the Middle and New Script, although some Old Script fragments have also been attested. Benjamin Fortson hypothesizes that &quot;Luvian was employed in rituals adopted by the Hittites.&quot; A large proportion of tablets containing Luwian passages reflect rituals emanating from Kizzuwatna. On the other hand, many Luwian glosses (foreign words) in Hittite texts appear to reflect a different dialect, namely Empire Luwian. The Hittite language of the respective tablets sometimes displays interference features, which suggests that they were recorded by Luwian native speakers.

The hieroglyphic corpus (Melchert&#x27;s HLuwian) is recorded in Anatolian hieroglyphs, reflecting Empire Luwian and its descendant Iron Age Luwian. Some HLuwian texts were found at Boğazkale, so it was formerly thought to have been a &quot;Hieroglyphic Hittite&quot;. The contexts in which CLuwian and HLuwian have been found are essentially distinct. Annick Payne asserts: &quot;With the exception of digraphic seals, the two scripts were never used together.&quot;

HLuwian texts are found on clay, shell, potsherds, pottery, metal, natural rock surfaces, building stone and sculpture, mainly carved lions. The images are in relief or counter-relief that can be carved or painted. There are also seals and sealings. A sealing is a counter-relief impression of hieroglyphic signs carved or cast in relief on a seal. The resulting signature can be stamped or rolled onto a soft material, such as sealing wax. The HLuwian writing system contains about 500 signs, 225 of which are logograms, and the rest purely functional determinatives and syllabograms, representing syllables of the form V, CV, or rarely CVCV.

HLuwian texts appear as early as the 14th century BC in names and titles on seals and sealings at Hattusa. Longer texts first appear in the 13th century BC. Payne refers to the Bronze Age HLuwian as Empire Luwian. All Hittite and CLuwian came to an end at 1200 BC as part of the Late Bronze Age collapse, but the concept of a &quot;fall&quot; of the Hittite Empire must be tempered in regard to the south, where the civilization of a number of Syro-Hittite states went on uninterrupted, using HLuwian, which Payne calls Iron-Age Luwian and dates 1000–700 BC. Presumably these autonomous &quot;Neo-Hittite&quot; heads of state no longer needed to report to Hattusa. HLuwian caches come from ten city states in northern Syria and southern Anatolia: Cilicia, Charchamesh, Tell Akhmar, Maras, Malatya, Commagene, Amuq, Aleppo, Hama, and Tabal.

==== Lycian ====

Lycian (called &quot;Lycian A&quot; when Milyan was a &quot;Lycian B&quot;) was spoken in classical Lycia, in southwestern Anatolia. It is attested from 172 inscriptions, mainly on stone, from about 150 funerary monuments, and 32 public documents. The writing system is the Lycian alphabet, which the Lycians modified from the Greek alphabet. In addition to the inscriptions are 200 or more coins stamped with Lycian names. Of the texts, some are bilingual in Lycian and Greek, and one, the Létôon trilingual, is in Lycian, Greek, and Aramaic. The longest text, the Xanthus stele, with about 250 lines, was originally believed to be bilingual in Greek and Lycian; however the identification of a verse in another, closely related language, a &quot;Lycian B&quot; identified now as Milyan, renders the stele trilingual. The earliest of the coins date before 500 BC; however, the writing system must have required time for its development and implementation.

The name of Lycia appears in Homer but more historically, in Hittite and in Egyptian documents among the &quot;Sea Peoples&quot;, as the Lukka, dwelling in the Lukka lands. No Lycian text survives from Late Bronze Age times, but the names offer a basis for postulating its continued existence.

Lycia was completely Hellenized by the end of the 4th century BC, after which Lycian is not to be found. Stephen Colvin goes so far as to term this, and the other scantily attested Luwic languages, &quot;Late Luwian&quot;, although they probably did not begin late. Analogously, Ivo Hajnal calls them – using an equivalent German term – .

==== Milyan ====

Milyan was previously considered a variety of Lycian, as &quot;Lycian B&quot;, but it is now classified as a separate language.

==== Carian ====

Carian was spoken in Caria. It is fragmentarily attested from graffiti by Carian mercenaries and other members of an ethnic enclave in Memphis, Egypt (and other places in Egypt), personal names in Greek records, twenty inscriptions from Caria (including four bilingual inscriptions), scattered inscriptions elsewhere in the Aegean world and words stated as Carian by ancient authors. Inscriptions first appeared in the 7th century BC.

==== Sidetic ====
Sidetic was spoken in the city of Side. It is known from coin legends and bilingual inscriptions that date from the 5th to the 2nd centuries BC.

==== Pisidian ====

The Pisidic language was spoken in Pisidia. Known from some thirty short inscriptions from the first to second centuries AD, it appears to be closely related to Lycian and Sidetic.

==== Kalašma ====

Kalašma was spoken in the Kalašma region, likely near the modern city of Bolu. It is known from a single inscription found in Hattusa.

=== Lydian ===

Lydian was spoken in Lydia. Within the Anatolian group, Lydian occupies a unique and problematic position due, first, to the still very limited evidence and understanding of the language and, second, to a number of features not shared with any other Anatolian language. The Lydian language is attested in graffiti and in coin legends from the end of the 8th or the beginning of the 7th century BC down to the 3rd century BC, but well-preserved inscriptions of significant length are presently limited to the 5th–4th centuries BC, during the period of Persian domination. Extant Lydian texts now number slightly over one hundred but are mostly fragmentary.

=== Other possible languages ===
It has been proposed that other languages of the family existed that have left no records, including the pre-Greek languages of Lycaonia and Isauria unattested in the alphabetic era. In these regions, only Hittite, Hurrian, and Luwian are attested in the Bronze Age. 

== Extinction ==
Anatolia was heavily Hellenized following the conquests of Alexander the Great, as well as the previous Greek colonisation, and the native languages of the area ceased to be spoken as a result of assimilation in the subsequent centuries, making Anatolian the first well-attested branch of Indo-European to become extinct. The only other well-known major branch with no living descendants is Tocharian, whose attestation ceases in the 8th century AD.

While Pisidian inscriptions date until the second century AD, the poorly-attested Isaurian language, which was probably a late Luwic dialect, appears to have been the last of the Anatolian languages to become extinct. Epigraphic evidence, including funerary inscriptions dating from as late as the 5th century, has been found by archaeologists.

Personal names with Anatolian etymologies are known from the Hellenistic and Roman era and may have outlasted the languages they came from. Examples include Cilician Ταρκυνδβερρας &quot;Tarku-ndberras&quot; &quot;assistance of Tarḫunz&quot;, Isaurian Ουαξαμοας &quot;Ouaxamoas &lt; *Waksa-muwa&quot; &quot;power of blessing(?)&quot;, and Lycaonian Πιγραμος &quot;Pigramos&quot; &quot;resplendent, mighty&quot; (cf. Carian 𐊷𐊹𐊼𐊥𐊪𐊸 &quot;Pikrmś,&quot; Luwian &quot;pīhramma/i-&quot;).

Several Ancient Greek words are suggested to be Anatolian borrowings, for example:
*&quot;Apóllōn&quot; (Doric: &quot;Apéllōn&quot;, Cypriot: &quot;Apeílōn&quot;), from *&quot;Apeljōn&quot;, as in Hittite &quot;Appaliunaš&quot;;
* &quot;dépas&quot; &#x27;cup; pot, vessel&#x27;, Mycenaean &quot;di-pa&quot;, from Hieroglyphic Luwian &quot;ti-pa-s&quot; &#x27;sky; bowl, cup&#x27; (cf. Hittite &quot;nēpis&quot; &#x27;sky; cup&#x27;);
* &quot;eléphās&quot; &#x27;ivory&#x27;, from Hittite &quot;laḫpa&quot; (itself from Mesopotamia; cf. Phoenician &quot;ʾlp&quot;, Egyptian &quot;ꜣbw&quot;);
* &quot;kýanos&quot; &#x27;dark blue glaze; enamel&#x27;, from Hittite &quot;kuwannan-&quot; &#x27;copper ore; azurite&#x27; (ultimately from Sumerian &quot;kù-an&quot;);
* &quot;kýmbachos&quot; &#x27;helmet&#x27;, from Hittite &quot;kupaḫi&quot; &#x27;headgear&#x27;;
* &quot;kýmbalon&quot; &#x27;cymbal&#x27;, from Hittite &quot;ḫuḫupal&quot; &#x27;wooden percussion instrument&#x27;;
* &quot;mólybdos&quot; &#x27;lead&#x27;, Mycenaean &quot;mo-ri-wo-do&quot;, from *&quot;morkw-io-&quot; &#x27;dark&#x27;, as in Lydian &quot;mariwda(ś)-k&quot; &#x27;the dark ones&#x27;;
* &quot;óbryza&quot; &#x27;vessel for refining gold&#x27;, from Hittite &quot;ḫuprušḫi&quot; &#x27;vessel&#x27;;
* &quot;tolýpē&quot; &#x27;ball of wool&#x27;, from Hittite &quot;taluppa&quot; &#x27;lump&#x27;/&#x27;clod&#x27; (or Cuneiform Luwian &quot;taluppa/i&quot;).

A few words in the Armenian language have been also suggested as possible borrowings from Hittite or Luwian, such as Arm. զուռնա &quot;zuṙna&quot; (compare Luwian &quot;zurni&quot; &quot;horn&quot;).

<doc id="102331" wikidata="Q255368" url="?curid=102331" title="Vittoria Colonna">
<text>Vittoria Colonna (April 149225 February 1547), marchioness of Pescara, was an Italian noblewoman and poetess. As an educated and married noblewoman whose husband was in captivity, Colonna was able to develop relationships within the intellectual circles of Ischia and Naples. Her early poetry began to attract attention in the late 1510s and she ultimately became one of the most popular poets of 16th-century Italy. Upon the early death of her husband, she took refuge at a convent in Rome. She remained a laywoman but experienced a strong spiritual renewal and remained devoutly religious for the rest of her life. Colonna is also known to have been a muse to Michelangelo Buonarroti, himself a poet.

==Early life and marriage==
Colonna was born at Marino in 1492, a fief of the Colonna family in the Alban Hills, near Rome. She was the daughter of Fabrizio Colonna, grand constable of the Kingdom of Naples, and of Agnese da Montefeltro, daughter of the Duke of Urbino. She was engaged in 1495 at the age of 3 years old to &quot;Ferrante&quot; Fernando Francesco d&#x27;Ávalos, son of the marquese di Pescara, at the insistence of Ferdinand, King of Naples.

In 1501, the Colonna family&#x27;s possessions and land were confiscated by Pope Alexander VI, and the family moved to Ischia, the home of Colonna&#x27;s betrothed. In Ischia, Colonna received a typical humanist education in literature and the arts from Costanza d&#x27;Avalos, the aunt of her betrothed, and gave early proof of a love of letters. Her hand was sought by many suitors, including the dukes of Savoy and Braganza, but she chose to marry d&#x27;Ávalos on the island of Ischia, on 27 December 1509. In Ischia, Vittoria Colonna became part of the literary circle of Costanza d&#x27;Avalos, Duchess of Francavilla, her husband&#x27;s aunt.

The couple lived together in Ischia until 1511, when her husband offered his sword to the League against the French. He was taken captive in 1512 at the Battle of Ravenna and was conveyed to France. During the months of detention and the long years of campaigning that followed, Colonna and d&#x27;Avalos corresponded in the most passionate terms both in prose and verse, but only one poetic &#x27;Epistle&#x27; to her husband has survived. Joseph Gibaldi has noted that Vittoria&#x27;s poem to Ferrante was a direct imitation of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Heroides&quot; in which famous ancient women such as Dido and Medea address complaints to their absent lovers. Because it is the only extant poem by Vittoria Colonna before her husband&#x27;s death, one may question whether her passionate verse reflected her true passion for her husband or were merely a stylish and scholarly reaction to a particular event. Also, it is known that Ferrante was not the most faithful husband since he had an affair with one of Isabella d&#x27;Este&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting.

Between 1516 and 1522, Colonna lost three members of her family. Her younger brother, Federico, died in 1516, followed by her father, Fabrizio, in 1520 and her mother, Agnese, in 1522.

Colonna and d&#x27;Avalos seldom saw each other during their marriage since he was one of the most active and brilliant captains of Emperor Charles V. However, Colonna&#x27;s influence was sufficient to keep her husband from joining the projected league against the emperor after the Battle of Pavia (1525) and to make him refuse the crown of Naples that had been offered to him as the price of his treason towards the French.

Colonna spent the summer of 1525 at her father&#x27;s castle in Marino, where she fell ill, and she suffered illness for the rest of her life. It was during that time that she received an early manuscript copy of Baldessare Castiglione&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Courtier&quot;, which she had circulated around Naples. On 21 September, Castiglione wrote her a letter to lament that she had thus enabled the unpublished work to be partially transcribed, and the pirated version pushed Castiglione into hastening the publication of his book.

==Widowhood (1525–1547)==
On 3 December 1525, Fernando died at Milan from the wounds that he had sustained at the Battle of Pavia. Colonna, who was hastening to tend him, received the news of his death at Viterbo She halted and retreated to the church of San Silvestro in Capite, in Rome, where there was a convent in the Order of Santa Chiara. Her request to take her vows and enter the convent was refused by Pope Clement VII and by her brother Ascanio, and she then returned to Ischia, where she remained for several years. Abigail Brundin has suggested Clement and Ascanio&#x27;s motivations for refusing Colonna&#x27;s request were that they hoped for a future marriage to create another desirable political alliance. However, she refused several suitors and dedicated herself to writing poetry.

The Sack of Rome (1527) finally gave the Colonna family the opportunity to improve their relationship with the Medici pope, Clement VII, by offering help to the Roman population. However, when the French army attacked Naples, the whole house of Avalos took refuge on the island of Ischia.

Nine months after the sack of the papal city, the historian Paolo Giovio arrived on Ischia after he had been invited by Colonna, where he stayed until 1528. During his stay on the island, he wrote his unpublished &quot;Dialogus de viris ac foeminis aetate nostra florentibus&quot;, which is set on Ischia between the end of September and the beginning of December 1527. In the third book of the dialogue, Giovio includes a ten-page encomium of Colonna.

In 1529, Colonna returned to Rome and spent the next few years between that city, Orvieto, Ischia and other places. Moreover, she tried to correct the wrongs of her late husband by asking the house of Avalos to return to the abbey of Montecassino some wrongfully seized land.

In 1532, before he died, Vittoria Colonna&#x27;s cousin Cardinal Pompeo Colonna dedicated to her his &quot;Apologia mulierum&quot; (Women&#x27;s Apologia), a treatise arguing that women should share in public offices and magistracies.
In 1535, her sister-in-law, Giovanna d&#x27;Aragona, separated from Colonna&#x27;s brother Ascanio and came to Ischia. Colonna tried to reconcile them, but even though Giovanna refused, both women became close, supported Juan de Valdés and tried to intercede for Ascanio when he refused to pay salt tax to Pope Paul III.

In 1537, Colonna was in Ferrara, where she made many friends and helped to establish a Capuchin monastery at the instance of the reforming monk Bernardino Ochino, who later became a Protestant.

At the age of 46, in 1536, she was back in Rome, where she won the esteem of Cardinals Reginald Pole and Contarini and became the object of a passionate friendship on the part of 61-year-old Michelangelo. The great artist addressed some of his finest sonnets to her, made drawings for her and spent long hours in her company. She created a gift manuscript of spiritual poetry for him. Her removal to Orvieto and Viterbo in 1541, on the occasion of her brother&#x27;s revolt against Paul III, produced no change in their relations, and they continued to visit and correspond as before.

On 8 May 1537, she arrived in Ferrara with some other women with the intention of continuing to travel to Venice and then to the Holy Land. It has been suggested that her aim in Ferrara was to establish a Capuchin monastery for Bernardino Ochino. Her health made Vittoria stay in Ferrara until February of the next year. Her friends dissuaded her from travelling to the Holy Land, and she returned to Rome in 1538.

She returned to Rome in 1544, staying as usual at the convent of San Silvestro and died there on 25 February 1547.

Pietro Bembo, Luigi Alamanni, Baldassare Castiglione and Marguerite de Navarre were among her literary friends. She was also on intimate terms with many of the members of the Italian reform movement, such as Pietro Carnesecchi and Ochino, but she died before the church crisis in Italy became acute. Although she was an advocate of religious reform, there is no reason to believe that her religious convictions were irreconcilable with those of the Catholic Church and that she ever became a Protestant.

== Legacy ==
Though it was long believed that Colonna&#x27;s poetry fell out of fashion after the 16th century, her poetry has been republished every century since, often in multiple editions. Her &quot;Rime amorose&quot; have been shown to have inspired the Spanish-Neapolitan poet Francisco de Aldana.

<doc id="102338" wikidata="Q131733" url="?curid=102338" title="Henry Cavendish">
<text>Henry Cavendish ( ; 10 October 1731 – 24 February 1810) was an English experimental and theoretical chemist and physicist. He is noted for his discovery of hydrogen, which he termed &quot;inflammable air&quot;. He described the density of inflammable air, which formed water on combustion, in a 1766 paper, &quot;On Factitious Airs&quot;. Antoine Lavoisier later reproduced Cavendish&#x27;s experiment and gave the element its name.

A shy man, Cavendish was distinguished for great accuracy and precision in his researches into the composition of atmospheric air, the properties of different gases, the synthesis of water, the law governing electrical attraction and repulsion, a mechanical theory of heat, and calculations of the density (and hence the mass) of the Earth. His experiment to measure the density of the Earth (which, in turn, allows the gravitational constant to be calculated) has come to be known as the Cavendish experiment.

==Early life==
Henry Cavendish was born on 10 October 1731 in Nice, where his family was living at the time. His mother was Lady Anne de Grey, fourth daughter of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent, and his father was Lord Charles Cavendish, the third son of William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire. The family traced its lineage across eight centuries to Norman times, and was closely connected to many aristocratic families of Great Britain. Henry&#x27;s mother died in 1733, three months after the birth of her second son, Frederick, and shortly before Henry&#x27;s second birthday, leaving Lord Charles Cavendish to bring up his two sons. Henry Cavendish was styled as &quot;The Honourable Henry Cavendish&quot;.

From the age of 11 Henry attended Newcome&#x27;s School, a private school near London. At the age of 18 (on 24 November 1748) he entered the University of Cambridge in St Peter&#x27;s College, now known as Peterhouse, but left three years later on 23 February 1751 without taking a degree (at the time, a common practice). He then lived with his father in London, where he soon had his own laboratory complete with dog-room.

Lord Charles Cavendish spent his life firstly in politics and then increasingly in science, especially in the Royal Society of London. In 1758, he took Henry to meetings of the Royal Society and also to dinners of the Royal Society Club. In 1760, Henry Cavendish was elected to both these groups, and he was assiduous in his attendance after that. He took virtually no part in politics, but followed his father into science, through his researches and his participation in scientific organisations. He was active in the Council of the Royal Society of London (to which he was elected in 1765).

His interest and expertise in the field of scientific instruments led him to head a committee to review the Royal Society&#x27;s meteorological instruments and to help assess the instruments of the Royal Greenwich Observatory. His first paper, &quot;Factitious Airs&quot;, appeared in 1766. Other committees on which he served included the committee of papers, which chose the papers for publication in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;, and the committees for the transit of Venus (1769), for the gravitational attraction of mountains (1774), and for the scientific instructions for Constantine Phipps&#x27;s expedition (1773) in search of the North Pole and the Northwest Passage. In 1773, Henry joined his father as an elected trustee of the British Museum, to which he devoted a good deal of time and effort. Soon after the Royal Institution of Great Britain was established, Cavendish became a manager (1800) and took an active interest, especially in the laboratory, where he observed and helped in Humphry Davy&#x27;s chemical experiments.

==Chemistry research==
About the time of his father&#x27;s death, Cavendish began to work closely with Charles Blagden, an association that helped Blagden enter fully into London&#x27;s scientific society. In return, Blagden helped to keep the world at a distance from Cavendish. Cavendish published no books and few papers, but he achieved much. Several areas of research, including mechanics, optics, and magnetism, feature extensively in his manuscripts, but they scarcely feature in his published work. Cavendish is considered to be one of the so-called pneumatic chemists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, along with, for example, Joseph Priestley, Joseph Black, and Daniel Rutherford. Cavendish found that a definite, peculiar, and highly inflammable gas, which he referred to as &quot;Inflammable Air&quot;, was produced by the action of certain acids on certain metals. This gas was hydrogen, which Cavendish correctly guessed was proportioned two to one in water.

Although others, such as Robert Boyle, had prepared hydrogen gas earlier, Cavendish is usually given the credit for recognising its elemental nature. In 1777, Cavendish discovered that air exhaled by mammals is converted to &quot;fixed air&quot; (carbon dioxide), not &quot;phlogisticated air&quot; as predicted by Joseph Priestley. Also, by dissolving alkalis in acids, Cavendish produced carbon dioxide, which he collected, along with other gases, in bottles inverted over water or mercury. He then measured their solubility in water and their specific gravity, and noted their combustibility. He concluded in his 1778 paper &quot;General Considerations on Acids&quot; that respirable air constitutes acidity. Cavendish was awarded the Royal Society&#x27;s Copley Medal for this paper. Gas chemistry was of increasing importance in the latter half of the 18th century, and became crucial for Frenchman Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier&#x27;s reform of chemistry, generally known as the chemical revolution.

In 1783, Cavendish published a paper on eudiometry (the measurement of the goodness of gases for breathing). He described a new eudiometer of his invention, with which he achieved the best results to date, using what in other hands had been the inexact method of measuring gases by weighing them. Then, after a repetition of a 1781 experiment performed by Priestley, Cavendish published a paper on the production of pure water by burning hydrogen in &quot;dephlogisticated air&quot; (air in the process of combustion, now known to be oxygen).
Cavendish concluded that rather than being synthesised, the burning of hydrogen caused water to be condensed from the air. Some physicists interpreted hydrogen as pure phlogiston. Cavendish reported his findings to Priestley no later than March 1783, but did not publish them until the following year. The Scottish inventor James Watt published a paper on the composition of water in 1783; controversy about who made the discovery first ensued.

In 1785, Cavendish investigated the composition of common (i.e. atmospheric) air, obtaining impressively accurate results. He conducted experiments in which hydrogen and ordinary air were combined in known ratios and then exploded with a spark of electricity. Furthermore, he also described an experiment in which he was able to remove, in modern terminology, both the oxygen and nitrogen gases from a sample of atmospheric air until only a small bubble of unreacted gas was left in the original sample. Using his observations, Cavendish observed that, when he had determined the amounts of phlogisticated air (nitrogen) and dephlogisticated air (oxygen), there remained a volume of gas amounting to 1/120 of the original volume of nitrogen.
By careful measurements he was led to conclude that &quot;common air consists of one part of dephlogisticated air [oxygen], mixed with four of phlogisticated [nitrogen]&quot;.

In the 1890s (around 100 years later) two British physicists, William Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh, realised that their newly discovered inert gas, argon, was responsible for Cavendish&#x27;s problematic residue; he had not made an error. What he had done was perform rigorous quantitative experiments, using standardised instruments and methods, aimed at reproducible results; taken the mean of the result of several experiments; and identified and allowed for sources of error. The balance that he used, made by a craftsman named Harrison, was the first of the precision balances of the 18th century, and as accurate as Lavoisier&#x27;s (which has been estimated to measure one part in 400,000). Cavendish worked with his instrument makers, generally improving existing instruments rather than inventing wholly new ones.

Cavendish, as indicated above, used the language of the old phlogiston theory in chemistry. In 1787, he became one of the earliest outside France to convert to the new antiphlogistic theory of Lavoisier, though he remained sceptical about the nomenclature of the new theory. He also objected to Lavoisier&#x27;s identification of heat as having a material or elementary basis. Working within the framework of Newtonian mechanism, Cavendish had tackled the problem of the nature of heat in the 1760s, explaining heat as the result of the motion of matter.

In 1783, he published a paper on the temperature at which mercury freezes and in that paper made use of the idea of latent heat, although he did not use the term because he believed that it implied acceptance of a material theory of heat. He made his objections explicit in his 1784 paper on air. He went on to develop a general theory of heat, and the manuscript of that theory has been persuasively dated to the late 1780s. His theory was at once mathematical and mechanical: it contained the principle of the conservation of heat (later understood as an instance of conservation of energy) and even included the concept (although not the label) of the mechanical equivalent of heat.

==Density of the Earth==
Following his father&#x27;s death, Henry bought another house in town and also a house in Clapham Common (built by Thomas Cubitt), at that time to the south-west of London. The London house contained the bulk of his library, while he kept most of his instruments at Clapham Common, where he carried out most of his experiments. The most famous of those experiments, published in 1798, was to determine the density of the Earth and became known as the Cavendish experiment. The apparatus Cavendish used for weighing the Earth was a modification of the torsion balance built by geologist John Michell, who died before he could begin the experiment. The apparatus was sent in crates to Cavendish, who completed the experiment in 1797–1798 and published the results.

The experimental apparatus consisted of a torsion balance with a pair of 2-inch 1.61-pound lead spheres suspended from the arm of a torsion balance and two much larger stationary lead balls (350 pounds). Cavendish intended to measure the force of gravitational attraction between the two. He noticed that Michell&#x27;s apparatus would be sensitive to temperature differences and induced air currents, so he made modifications by isolating the apparatus in a separate room with external controls and telescopes for making observations.

Using this equipment, Cavendish calculated the attraction between the balls from the period of oscillation of the torsion balance, and then he used this value to calculate the density of the Earth. Cavendish found that the Earth&#x27;s average density is 5.48 times greater than that of water. John Henry Poynting later noted that the data should have led to a value of 5.448, and indeed that is the average value of the twenty-nine determinations Cavendish included in his paper. The error in the published number was due to a simple arithmetical mistake on his part. What was extraordinary about Cavendish&#x27;s experiment was its elimination of every source of error and every factor that could disturb the experiment, and its precision in measuring an astonishingly small attraction, a mere 1/50,000,000 of the weight of the lead balls. The result that Cavendish obtained for the density of the Earth is within 1 per cent of the currently accepted figure.

Cavendish&#x27;s work led others to accurate values for the gravitational constant (&quot;G&quot;) and Earth&#x27;s mass. Based on his results, one can calculate a value for G of 6.754 × 10−11N-m2/kg2, which compares favourably with the modern value of 6.67428 × 10−11N-m2/kg2.

Books often describe Cavendish&#x27;s work as a measurement of either &quot;G&quot; or the Earth&#x27;s mass. Since these are related to the Earth&#x27;s density by a trivial web of algebraic relations, none of these sources are wrong, but they do not match the exact word choice of Cavendish, and this mistake has been pointed out by several authors. Cavendish&#x27;s stated goal was to measure the Earth&#x27;s density.

The first time that the constant got this name was in 1873, almost 100 years after the Cavendish experiment. Cavendish&#x27;s results also give the Earth&#x27;s mass.

==Electrical research==
Cavendish&#x27;s electrical and chemical experiments, like those on heat, had begun while he lived with his father in a laboratory in their London house. Lord Charles Cavendish died in 1783, leaving almost all of his very substantial estate to Henry. Like his theory of heat, Cavendish&#x27;s comprehensive theory of electricity was mathematical in form and was based on precise quantitative experiments. Working with his colleague, Timothy Lane, he created an artificial torpedo fish that could dispense electric shocks to show that the source of shock from these fish was electricity. He published an early version of his theory of electricity in 1771, based on an expansive electrical fluid that exerted pressure. He demonstrated that if the intensity of electric force were inversely proportional to distance, then the electric fluid more than that needed for electrical neutrality would lie on the outer surface of an electrified sphere; then he confirmed this experimentally. Cavendish continued to work on electricity after this initial paper, but he published no more on the subject.

Cavendish wrote papers on electrical topics for the Royal Society but the bulk of his electrical experiments did not become known until they were collected and published by James Clerk Maxwell a century later, in 1879, long after other scientists had been credited with the same results. Cavendish&#x27;s electrical papers from the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London&quot; have been reprinted, together with most of his electrical manuscripts, in &quot;The Scientific Papers of the Honourable Henry Cavendish, F.R.S.&quot; (1921). According to the 1911 edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, among Cavendish&#x27;s discoveries were the concept of electric potential (which he called the &quot;degree of electrification&quot;), an early unit of capacitance (that of a sphere one inch in diameter), the formula for the capacitance of a plate capacitor, the concept of the dielectric constant of a material, the relationship between electric potential and current (now called Ohm&#x27;s law) (1781), laws for the division of current in parallel circuits (now attributed to Charles Wheatstone), and the inverse square law of variation of electric force with distance, now called Coulomb&#x27;s law.

==Death==
Cavendish died at Clapham on 24 February 1810 (as one of the wealthiest men in Britain) and was buried in the church that is now Derby Cathedral, alongside many of his ancestors. The road he used to live on in Derby has been named after him, as has a road near his house in Clapham, of which the north part is part of the South Circular Road. The University of Cambridge&#x27;s Cavendish Laboratory was endowed by one of Cavendish&#x27;s later relatives, William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire (Chancellor of the University from 1861 to 1891).

==Personality and legacy==
Cavendish inherited two fortunes that were so large that Jean Baptiste Biot called him &quot;the richest of all the savants and the most knowledgeable of the rich&quot;. At his death, Cavendish was the largest depositor in the Bank of England. He was a shy man who was uncomfortable in society and avoided it when he could. He could speak to only one person at a time, and only if the person were known to him and male. He conversed little, always dressed in an old-fashioned suit, and developed no known deep personal attachments outside his family. Cavendish was taciturn and solitary and regarded by many as eccentric. He communicated with his female servants only by notes. By one account, Cavendish had a back staircase added to his house to avoid encountering his housekeeper, because he was especially shy of women. The contemporary accounts of his personality have led some modern commentators, such as Oliver Sacks, to speculate that he was autistic.

His only social outlet was the Royal Society Club, whose members dined together before weekly meetings. Cavendish seldom missed these meetings, and was profoundly respected by his contemporaries. However, his shyness made conversation difficult; guests were advised to wander close to him and then speak as if &quot;into vacancy. If their remarks were scientifically worthy, they might receive a mumbled reply&quot;. Cavendish was more likely not to reply at all. Cavendish&#x27;s religious views were also considered eccentric for his time. He was considered to be agnostic. As his biographer, George Wilson, comments, &quot;As to Cavendish&#x27;s religion, he was nothing at all.&quot;

The arrangement of his residence reserved only a fraction of space for personal comfort as his library was detached, the upper rooms and lawn were for astronomical observation and his drawing room was a laboratory with a forge in an adjoining room. He also enjoyed collecting fine furniture, exemplified by his purchase of a set of &quot;ten inlaid satinwood chairs with matching cabriole legged sofa&quot;.

Because of his asocial and secretive behaviour, Cavendish often avoided publishing his work, and much of his findings were not told even to his fellow scientists. In the late nineteenth century, long after his death, James Clerk Maxwell looked through Cavendish&#x27;s papers and found observations and results for which others had been given credit. Examples of what was included in Cavendish&#x27;s discoveries or anticipations were Richter&#x27;s law of reciprocal proportions, Ohm&#x27;s law, Dalton&#x27;s law of partial pressures, principles of electrical conductivity (including Coulomb&#x27;s law), and Charles&#x27;s Law of gases. A manuscript &quot;Heat&quot;, tentatively dated between 1783 and 1790, describes a &quot;mechanical theory of heat&quot;. Hitherto unknown, the manuscript was analysed in the early 21st century. Historian of science Russell McCormmach proposed that &quot;Heat&quot; is the only 18th-century work prefiguring thermodynamics. Theoretical physicist Dietrich Belitz concluded that in this work Cavendish &quot;got the nature of heat essentially right&quot;.

As Cavendish performed his famous density of the Earth experiment in an outbuilding in the garden of his Clapham Common estate, his neighbours would point out the building and tell their children that it was where the world was weighed. In honour of Henry Cavendish&#x27;s achievements and due to an endowment granted by Henry&#x27;s relative William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire, the University of Cambridge&#x27;s physics laboratory was named the Cavendish Laboratory by Maxwell, the first Cavendish Professor of Physics and an admirer of Cavendish&#x27;s work.

<doc id="102345" wikidata="Q199659" url="?curid=102345" title="Mustafa II">
<text>Mustafa II (; &quot;Muṣṭafā-yi sānī&quot;; 6 February 1664 – 29 December 1703) was the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1695 to 1703.

==Early life==

He was born at Edirne Palace on 6 February 1664. He was the son of Sultan Mehmed IV (1648–87) and Gülnuş Sultan, originally named Evmania, who was of Greek descent. 

Much of Mustafa&#x27;s childhood was passed in Edirne, the city of his birth. While he was in Mora Yenişehiri with his father in 1669, he began his religious education under Vani Mehmed Efendi, undergoing the &quot;bed-i besmele&quot; ceremony. The writing teacher was the famous calligrapher Hâfiz Osman. In 1675, he and his brother Ahmed were circumcised and his sisters Hatice Sultan and Fatma Sultan were married. The celebration lasted 20 days.

==Reign==
===Great Turkish War===
During his reign the Great Turkish War, which had started in 1683, was still going on. After the failure of the second Siege of Vienna (1683) the Holy League had captured large parts of the Empire&#x27;s territory in Europe. The Habsburg armies came as far as Niš, modern-day Serbia, before being pushed back across the Danube by 1690. Sultan Mustafa II was determined to recapture the lost territories in Hungary and therefore he personally commanded his armies. He set out from Niš with a large Ottoman Army to campaign against the Holy League.

===Capture of Chios===
First, the Ottoman Navy recaptured the island of Chios after defeating the Venetian Fleet twice, in the Battle of the Oinousses Islands (1695) and in the Battle of Chios (1695), in February 1695. In June 1695, Mustafa II left Edirne for his first military campaign against the Habsburg Empire. By September 1695 the town of Lipova was captured. On 18 September 1695 the Venetian Navy was again defeated in the naval victory of Zeytinburnu. A few days later the Habsburg army was defeated in the Battle of Lugos. Afterwards the Ottoman Army returned to the capital. Meanwhile, the Ottoman fortress in Azov was successfully defended against the besieging Russian forces.

As Mustafa attempted to realize his thoughts quickly, the island of Chios, which had previously fallen into the hands of the Venetians, was taken back at that time, the Crimean Tatars Shahbaz Giray entered the territory of Poland and proceeded to Lemberg (Lviv), and returned with many captives and booty. There were reports that the Venetians were influenced by the Ottoman forces on the Herzegovina front in Peloponnese. Especially the recovery of Chios was considered auspicious and was celebrated with great festivities in Edirne. Meanwhile, the tips of the people were distributed to the locals.

===Habsburg wars===
In April 1696 Mustafa II left Edirne for his second military campaign against the Habsburg Empire. In August 1696 the Russians besieged Azov for the second time and captured the fortress. In August 1696 the Ottoman troops defeated the Habsburg army in the Battle of Ulaş and in the Battle of Cenei. After these victories the Ottoman troops captured Timișoara and Koca Cafer Pasha was appointed as the protector of Belgrade. Afterwards the army returned to the Ottoman capital.

In June 1697 Mustafa II left the capital on his third military campaign against the Habsburg Empire. However, the Ottoman Army suffered a defeat in the Battle of Zenta and Grand Vizier Elmas Mehmed Pasha died in the battle. Afterwards the Ottomans signed a treaty with the Holy League.

The most traumatic event of his reign was the loss of Hungary by the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699.

Yet even if Ottoman power seemed to wane on one side of the empire, this did not mean that Ottoman efforts at expansion ceased. In 1700, for example, the Grand Vizier Amcazade Hüseyin boasted to a recalcitrant tribe residing in swamps near Baghdad that they ought to abide by the sultan&#x27;s rule, since his grasp extended even to their marshy redoubts. The Grand Vizier added that, after all, Mustafa II was &quot;the Lord of Water and Mud.&quot;

At the end of his reign, Mustafa II sought to restore power to the Sultanate, which had been an increasingly symbolic position since the middle of the 17th century, when Mehmed IV had signed over his executive powers to the Grand Vizier. Mustafa II&#x27;s strategy was to create an alternative base of power for himself by making the position of timars, the Ottoman cavalrymen, hereditary and thus loyal to him. The timars, however, were at this point increasingly an obsolete part of the Ottoman military machine.

===Deposition===
The stratagem failed, the disaffected troops bound to a Georgian campaign mutinied in the capital (called the &quot;Edirne event&quot; by historians), and Mustafa was deposed on 22 August 1703.

==Character==

Defined as having a red beard, a short neck, he was of medium height and majestic. Mustafa II has a miniature made by Levni. After 1699, like his father, he was interested in hunting and entertainment, engaged in literature and wrote poems with the pseudonym. A curiosity of this sultan, who had lines in the style of Celi, Nesih and Sulus was archery. Silahdar Findiklili Mehmed Agha, who was assigned to write the history of his period. He described Mustafa&#x27;s reign in his book Nusretname.

==Family==
With the rise of Mustafa II, the title of &quot;Haseki Sultan&quot; was definitively abolished, to be permanently replaced by the less prestigious and not exclusive &quot;Kadın&quot; (imperial consort). Mustafa II also created a new class of concubines, the &quot;Ikbal&quot;: inferior in rank to the Kadın in the hierarchy of the harem, they were initially called with the normal title of &quot;Hatun&quot; (woman), later modified in that, superior, of &quot;Hanim&quot; (lady).

Several of his concubines and consorts were married after his deposition by order of the new sultan, his brother Ahmed III.

=== Consorts ===
Mustafa II had at least ten consorts: 
* Alicenab Kadın (died 20 April 1699, Edirne Palace, Edirne, buried in Darülhadis Mosque). BaşKadin (first imperial consort) until her death.
* Afife Kadın (c. 1682 – Constantinople, after 1718). BaşKadin after Alicenab&#x27;s death. Also called Hafife, Hafiten, Hafize, Hafise or Hafsa in the European chronicles, she was Mustafa&#x27;s most loved consort, sentiment reciprocated, even if they were never legally married. She had a daughter in 1696 and later became the mother of five of Mustafa&#x27;s eight sons.
* Saliha Kadın (died 21 September 1739, Tırnakçı Palace, Istanbul, buried in Turhan Sultan Mausoleum, New Mosque). She was Valide Sultan of Mahmud I. 
* Şehsuvar Kadın (died 27 April 1756, Topkapı Palace, Istanbul, buried in Nuruosmaniye Mosque). She was Valide Sultan of Osman III. 
* Bahtiyar Kadın. One of his first concubines, she was probably the mother of one of Mustafa&#x27;s oldest daughters. 
* Ivaz Kadın. Mentioned as a Kadin in a document dated 1696/1697, she was probably the mother of one of Mustafa&#x27;s oldest daughters.
* Hatice Kadin. Before becoming a consort, she was a high-ranking harem lady-in-waiting.
* Hüsnüşah Kadın. She died on 1 January 1700.
* Fatma Şahin Hatun, then Hanim. Baş Ikbal (first ikbal). After Mustafa&#x27;s deposition she was removed from the harem and married by order of Ahmed III.
* Hanife Hatun, then Hanim. After Mustafa&#x27;s deposition she was removed from the harem and married by order of Ahmed III. From her new husband she had a son named Ibrahim and a daughter.

=== Sons ===
Mustafa II had at least eight sons, including five who died as infants with Afife Kadın: 
* Mahmud I (2 August 1696 – 13 December 1754) – with Saliha Kadin. 24th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. 
* Şehzade Mehmed (27 November 1698 – 3 June 1703, Edirne Palace, Edirne, buried in Turhan Sultan&#x27;s türbe, New Mosque) – with Afife Kadın. He was the favorite son of Mustafa II, who suffered his death immensely.
* Osman III (2 January 1699 – 30 October 1757) – with Şehsuvar Kadin. 25th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire.

* Şehzade Selim (16 May 1700 – 8 June 1702, Edirne Palace, Edirne, buried in Turhan Sultan&#x27;s turbe New Mosque) – with Afife Kadın. 
* Şehzade Ahmed (3 March 1702 – 7 September 1703, Edirne Palace, Edirne, buried in Darülhadis Mosque) – with Afife Kadın.

=== Daughters ===
Mustafa II had at least twelve daughters, of which one, among the three eldest, with Afife Kadin: 
* Ayşe Sultan (30 April 1696 – 26 September 1752, Istanbul, buried in New Mosque). Nicknamed &quot;the eldest&quot; to distinguish her from her cousin Ayşe Sultan &quot;the younger&quot;, daughter of Ahmed III. She married three times, but had no children.
* Emine Sultan (1 September 1696 –1739, Istanbul, buried in New Mosque). She married four times, but had no children.

<text>The Museum of Pop Culture (or MoPOP) is a nonprofit museum in Seattle, Washington, United States, dedicated to contemporary popular culture. It was founded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in 2000 as the Experience Music Project. Since then MoPOP has organized dozens of exhibits, 17 of which have toured across the U.S. and internationally.

The museumformerly known as Experience Music Project, Experience Music Project and Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame (or EMP|SFM), and later EMP Museum until November 2016—has initiated many public programs including &quot;Sound Off!&quot;, an annual 21-and-under battle-of-the-bands that supports the all-ages scene; and &quot;Pop Conference&quot;, an annual gathering of academics, critics, musicians, and music buffs.

MoPOP, in collaboration with the Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF), presents the Science Fiction and Fantasy Short Film Festival which takes place every winter. Since 2007, the MoPop celebrates recording artists with the Founders Award for their noteworthy contributions.

==Exhibits and activities==
MoPOP is home to numerous exhibits and interactive activity stations as well as sound sculpture and various educational resources:
* A building, designed by Frank O. Gehry, housing several galleries and the Sky Church, which features a Barco C7 black package LED screen, one of the largest indoor LED screens in the world.
* Exhibits covering pop culture, from the art of fantasy, horror cinema, and video games to science fiction literature and costumes from screen and stage.
* Interactive activities are included in galleries like Sound Lab and On Stage where visitors can explore hands-on the tools of rock and roll through instruments, and perform music before a virtual audience.
* IF VI WAS IX, a guitar sculpture consisting of more than 500 musical instruments and 30 computers conceived by British exhibit designer Neal Potter and developed by sound sculptor Trimpin.
* The world&#x27;s largest collection of artifacts, hand-written lyrics, personal instruments, and original photographs celebrating the music and history of Seattle musician Jimi Hendrix and the band Nirvana.
* Educational resources including MoPOP&#x27;s Curriculum Connections in-museum workshops and outreach programs; STAR (Student Training in Artistic Reach); Creativity Camps for Kids; Teen Artist Workshops; Write Out of This World, an annual sci-fi and fantasy short story contest for 3rd to 12th graders; and the Hip-Hop Artist Residency.
* Public programs such as MoPOP&#x27;s Science Fiction + Fantasy Short Film Festival, Pop Conference, the Youth Advisory Board (YAB), and Sound Off!, the Pacific Northwest&#x27;s premier battle-of-the-bands.

MoPOP was also the location of the first NIME workshop&#x27;s concert and demo program. This subsequently became the annual International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression, a venue for research on music technology.

==Science Fiction Museum==

The Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame was founded by Paul Allen and his sister Jody Patton, and opened to the public on June 18, 2004. It incorporated the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame which had been established in 1996. The museum was divided into several galleries with themes such as &quot;Homeworld&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Voyages&quot;, &quot;Brave New Worlds&quot;, and &quot;Them!&quot;, each displaying related memorabilia (movie props, first editions, costumes, and models) in large display cases, posters, and interactive displays. It was said about the museum that &quot;From robots to jet packs to space suits and ray guns, it&#x27;s all here.&quot;

Members of the museum&#x27;s advisory board included Steven Spielberg, Ray Bradbury, James Cameron, and George Lucas. Among its collection of artifacts were Captain Kirk&#x27;s command chair from &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the B9 robot from &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, the Death Star model from &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the T-800 Terminator and the dome from the film &quot;Silent Running&quot;. Although the Science Fiction Museum as a permanent collection was de-installed in March 2011, a new exhibit named &quot;Icons of Science Fiction&quot; opened as a replacement in June 2012. At this time the new Hall of Fame display was unveiled and the class of 2012 inducted.

==Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame==
The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame was founded in 1996 by the Kansas City Science Fiction and Fantasy Society and the Center for the Study of Science Fiction (CSSF) at the University of Kansas (KU). The chairmen were Keith Stokes (1996–2001) and Robin Wayne Bailey (2002–2004). Only writers and editors were eligible for recognition and four were inducted annually, two deceased and two living. Each class of four was announced at Kansas City&#x27;s annual science fiction convention, ConQuesT, and inducted at the Campbell Conference hosted by CSSF.

The Hall of Fame stopped inducting fantasy writers after 2004, when it became part of the Science Fiction Museum affiliated with the Museum of Pop Culture, under the name &quot;Science Fiction Hall of Fame&quot;. Having inducted 36 writers in nine years, the organization began to recognize non-literary media in 2005. It retained the quota of four new members and thus reduced the annual number of writers. The 2005 and 2006 press releases placed new members in &quot;Literature&quot;, &quot;Art&quot;, &quot;Film, Television and Media&quot;, and &quot;Open&quot; categories, one for each category. In 2007 and 2008, the fourth inductee was placed in one of the three substantial categories.

MoPOP de-installed the Science Fiction Museum in March 2011. When the &quot;Icons of Science Fiction&quot; exhibition opened in June 2012, a new Hall of Fame display was unveiled and the class of 2012 was inducted.

Nominations are submitted by the public, but the selections are made by &quot;award-winning science fiction authors, artists, editors, publishers, and film professionals&quot;.

MoPOP restored the original name online during June 2013 and announced five new members, one daily, beginning June 17, 2013. The first four were cited largely or wholly for science fiction works, however the final one was J.R.R. Tolkien, who was &quot;hailed as the father of modern fantasy literature&quot;.

* Works: &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;; &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;; &quot;The Matrix&quot;; &quot;Myst&quot;; &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;; Wonder Woman; &quot;The X-Files&quot;

The class of 2023 brought the number of members to 109, which includes the 20 additional inductees added in 2016.

In November 2016, the museum changed its name from the Experience Music Project Museum to the Museum of Pop Culture, or MoPOP for short.

==Architecture==

MoPOP is located on the campus of Seattle Center, adjacent to the Space Needle and the Seattle Center Monorail, which runs through the building. The structure itself was designed by Frank Gehry and resembles many of his firm&#x27;s other works in its sheet-metal construction, such as Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, Walt Disney Concert Hall, and Gehry Tower. Much of the building material is exposed in the building&#x27;s interior. The building contains , with a footprint. The name of the museum&#x27;s central Sky Church pays homage to Jimi Hendrix. A concert venue capable of holding up to 800 guests, the last structural steel beam to be put in place bears the signatures of all construction workers who were on site on the day it was erected. Hoffman Construction Company of Portland, Oregon, was the general contractor, while Magnusson Klemencic Associates of Seattle were the structural engineers for the project.

Even before groundbreaking, the &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; said the design could refer to &quot;the often quoted comparison to a smashed electric guitar.&quot; Gehry himself had in fact made the comparison: &quot;We started collecting pictures of Stratocasters, bringing in guitar bodies, drawing on those shapes in developing our ideas.&quot; The architecture was greeted by Seattle residents with a mixture of acclaim for Gehry and derision for this particular edifice. British-born, Seattle-based writer Jonathan Raban remarked that &quot;Frank Gehry has created some wonderful buildings, like the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, but his Seattle effort, the Experience Music Project, is not one of them.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; architecture critic Herbert Muschamp described it as &quot;something that crawled out of the sea, rolled over, and died&quot;. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine called it one of the world&#x27;s 10 ugliest buildings. Others describe it as a &quot;blob&quot; or call it &quot;The Hemorrhoids&quot;. Despite some critical reviews of the structure, the building has been called &quot;a fitting backdrop for the world&#x27;s largest collection of Jimi Hendrix memorabilia.&quot; The building&#x27;s exterior, which features a fusion of textures and colors including gold, silver, deep red, blue and a &quot;shimmering purple haze&quot;, has been declared &quot;an apt representation of the American rock experience.&quot;

==Finances==
The museum has had mixed financial success. In an effort to raise more funds, museum organizers used Allen&#x27;s extensive art collection to create a 2006 exhibit at the museum entitled &quot;DoubleTake: From Monet to Lichtenstein&quot;. The exhibit included Roy Lichtenstein&#x27;s &quot;The Kiss&quot; (1962), Pierre-Auguste Renoir&#x27;s &quot;The Reader&quot; (1877), Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;Orchard with Peach Trees in Blossom&quot; (1888), Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Four Bathers&quot; (1921) and several works of art from Claude Monet including one of the &quot;Water Lilies&quot; paintings (1919) and &quot;The Mula Palace&quot; (1908). Since then the museum has organized numerous exhibitions focused more specifically on popular culture, such as &quot;Sound and Vision: Artists Tell Their Stories&quot;, which opened February 28, 2007. This brought together both music and science fiction in a single exhibit, and drew on the museum&#x27;s extensive collection of oral history recordings. The museum&#x27;s recent exhibitions have ranged from horror cinema, video games, and black leather jackets to fantasy film and literature.

==Founders Award==
Since 2007, the Museum of Pop Culture&#x27;s &quot;Founders Award&quot; has celebrated artists whose &quot;noteworthy contributions continue to nurture the next generation of risk-takers&quot;. The annual benefit gala is key in funding the museum&#x27;s educational programs, community engagement, and exhibitions. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the gala had to be cancelled and for the first time ever, the event was made free to the public, streaming online on December 1, 2020, as MoPOP honored Seattle&#x27;s own Alice in Chains. The benefit streaming raised more than $600,000 for MoPOP in its first night. A compilation featuring highlights from the tribute was made available for streaming on Amazon Music.

<doc id="102348" wikidata="Q909166" url="?curid=102348" title="Silly Symphony">
<text>Silly Symphony (also known as Silly Symphonies) is an American animated series of 75 musical short films produced by Walt Disney Productions from 1929 to 1939. As the series name implies, the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; were originally intended as whimsical accompaniments to pieces of music. As such, the films usually did not feature continuing characters, unlike the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; shorts produced by Disney at the same time (exceptions to this include &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot;, &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot;, and &quot;Three Orphan Kittens&quot;, which all had sequels). The series is notable for its innovation with Technicolor and the multiplane motion picture camera, as well as its introduction of the character Donald Duck, who made his first appearance in the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; cartoon &quot;The Wise Little Hen&quot; in 1934. Seven shorts won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.

The series also spawned a &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; newspaper comic strip distributed by King Features Syndicate, as well as a Dell comic book series and several children&#x27;s books.

The &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; returned to theaters with its re-issues and re-releases, and tied with Joseph Barbera and William Hanna&#x27;s &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;&#x27;s record for most Oscar wins for a cartoon series in the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film category.

The first five &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; shorts entered the public domain on January 1, 2025.

==Production==
While Walt Disney and Carl Stalling, a theatre organist from Kansas City, were in New York to add sound to the Mickey Mouse shorts &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot;, &quot;The Barn Dance&quot; and &quot;Plane Crazy&quot;, Stalling suggested the idea of making a series of musical animated shorts that combined the latest sound technology with storytelling. At first Walt did not seem interested, but when they returned to New York in February to record the sound for a fifth Mickey Mouse cartoon, &quot;The Opry House&quot;, they also recorded the soundtrack for &quot;The Skeleton Dance&quot;, the type of short that Stalling had suggested and the first Silly Symphony cartoon.

Within the animation industry, the series is known for its use by Walt Disney as a platform for experimenting with processes, techniques, characters, and stories in order to further the art of animation. It also provided a venue to try out techniques and technologies, such as Technicolor, special effects animation, and dramatic storytelling in animation, that would be crucial to Disney&#x27;s plans to eventually begin making feature-length animated films.

Shortly after the switch to United Artists, the series became even more popular. Walt Disney had seen some of Dr. Herbert Kalmus&#x27; tests for a new three-strip, full-color Technicolor process, which would replace the previous two-tone Technicolor process. Disney signed a contract with Technicolor which gave the Disney studio exclusive rights to the new three-strip process through the end of 1935, and had a 60% complete &quot;Symphony&quot;, &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot;, scrapped and redone in full color. &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot; was the first animated film to use the three-strip Technicolor process, and was a phenomenal success. Within a year, the now-in-Technicolor &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; series had popularity and success that matched (and later surpassed) that of the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; cartoons. The contract Disney had with Technicolor would also later be extended another five years as well.

The success of &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; would be tremendously boosted after &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; was released in 1933 and became a box office sensation; the film was featured in movie theaters for several months and also featured the hit song that became the anthem of the Great Depression, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf&quot;. Several &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; entries, including &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; (1933), &quot;The Grasshopper and the Ants&quot; (1934), &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot; (1935), &quot;The Country Cousin&quot; (1936), &quot;The Old Mill&quot; (1937), &quot;Wynken, Blynken, and Nod&quot; (1938), and &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; (1939, with an earlier black-and-white version from 1931), are among the most notable films produced by Walt Disney.

Due to problems related to Disney&#x27;s scheduled productions of cartoons, a deal was made with Harman and Ising to produce three Silly Symphonies: &quot;Merbabies&quot;, &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot;, and &quot;The Little Bantamweight&quot;. Only one of these cartoons, &quot;Merbabies&quot;, ended up being bought by Disney, the remaining two Harman-Ising Silly Symphonies were then sold to MGM who released them as Happy Harmonies cartoons. Disney ceased production of &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; in 1939.

==Distribution==
The series was first distributed by Pat Powers from 1929 to 1930 and released by Celebrity Productions (1929–1930) indirectly through Columbia Pictures. The original basis of the cartoons was musical novelty, and the musical scores of the first cartoons were composed by Carl Stalling.

===Columbia Pictures===
After viewing &quot;The Skeleton Dance&quot;, the manager at Columbia Pictures quickly became interested in distributing the series, and gained the perfect opportunity to acquire Silly Symphonies after Disney broke with Celebrity Productions head Pat Powers after Powers signed Disney&#x27;s colleague Ub Iwerks to a studio contract. Columbia Pictures (1930–1932) agreed to pick up the direct distribution of the Mickey Mouse series on the condition that they would have exclusive rights to distribute the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; series; at first, &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; could not even come close to the popularity Mickey Mouse had. The original title cards to the shorts released by Celebrity Productions and Columbia Pictures were all redrawn after Walt Disney stopped distributing his cartoons through them. Meanwhile, more competition spread for Disney after Max Fleischer&#x27;s flapper cartoon character Betty Boop began to gain more and more popularity after starring in the cartoon &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;. By August 1932, Betty Boop became so popular that the Talkartoon series was renamed as Betty Boop cartoons.

===United Artists===
In 1932, after falling out with Columbia Pictures, Disney began distributing his products through United Artists. UA refused to distribute the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; unless Disney associated Mickey Mouse with them somehow, resulting in the &quot;Mickey Mouse presents a &quot;Silly Symphony&quot;&quot; title cards and posters that introduced and promoted the series during its five-year run for UA. United Artists also agreed to double the budget for each cartoon from $7,500 to $15,000. The first short released by United Artists was &quot;The Bears and Bees&quot;.

===RKO Radio Pictures===
In 1937, Disney signed a distribution deal with RKO Radio Pictures to distribute the Silly Symphony cartoons, along with the Mickey Mouse series. RKO would continue to distribute until the end of the series in 1939.

===Home media===
Several &quot;Symphonies&quot; have been released in home media, most of the time as bonus shorts that relate to something within various Disney films. For instance, the original &quot;Dumbo&quot; VHS included &quot;Father Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;, &quot;The Practical Pig&quot; and &quot;Three Orphan Kittens&quot; as bonus shorts to make up for the film&#x27;s short length. In the UK, several &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; were released in compilations under Disney Videos&#x27; &quot;Storybook Favourites&quot; brand. The three &quot;Storybook Favourites Shorts&quot; volumes released included among others, &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot;, &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot; and the remake of &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;.

On December 4, 2001, Disney released &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; as part of its DVD series &quot;Walt Disney Treasures&quot;. On December 19, 2006, &quot;More Silly Symphonies&quot; was released, completing the collection and allowing the cartoons to be completely available to the public.

Some Disney Blu-ray discs include &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; as high definition special features. &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; includes six, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;Dumbo&quot; both contain two and Pixar&#x27;s &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; contains one.

The &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; shorts originally aired on Turner Classic Movies&#x27; period program block &quot;Treasures from the Disney Vault&quot;.

Some &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; shorts are viewable on Disney+.

==List of films==
The &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; are listed here in production order:
==Reception==
Disney&#x27;s experiments were widely praised within the film industry, and the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film seven times, maintaining a six-year-hold on the category after it was first introduced. This record was matched only by MGM&#x27;s &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; series during the 1940s and 1950s.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Symphonies&quot; changed the course of Disney Studio history when Walt&#x27;s plans to direct his first feature cartoon became problematic after his warm-up to the task &quot;The Golden Touch&quot; was widely seen (even by Disney himself) as stiff and slowly paced. This motivated him to embrace his role as being the producer and providing creative oversight (especially of the story) for &quot;Snow White&quot; while tasking David Hand to handle the actual directing.

&quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; brought along many imitators, including Warner Bros. cartoon series &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;, MGM&#x27;s &quot;Happy Harmonies&quot;, and later, Universal&#x27;s &quot;Swing Symphony&quot;.

Years later after the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; ended, Disney occasionally produced a handful of one-shot cartoons, playing the same style as the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; series. Unlike the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; canon, most of these &quot;Specials&quot; have a narration, usually by Disney legend Sterling Holloway.

In the 1934 MGM film &quot;Hollywood Party&quot;, Mickey Mouse appears with Jimmy Durante, where they introduce &quot;The Hot Choc-late Soldiers&quot;.

The 1999–2000 television series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; used the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; title for some of its new cartoons, but unlike the original cartoons, these did feature continuing characters.

As of 2021, three of the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; shorts (&quot;Three Little Pigs&quot;, &quot;The Old Mill&quot;, and &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot;), have been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Comic adaptations==
A Sunday &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; comic strip ran in newspapers from January 10, 1932, to July 12, 1942. The strip featured adaptations of some of the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; cartoons, including &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;, &quot;The Robber Kitten&quot;, &quot;Elmer Elephant&quot;, &quot;Farmyard Symphony&quot; and &quot;Little Hiawatha&quot;. This strip began with a two-year sequence about Bucky Bug, a character based on the bugs in &quot;Bugs in Love&quot;.

There was also an occasional &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; comic book, with nine issues published by Dell Comics from September 1952 to February 1959. The first issue of this anthology comic featured adaptations of some &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; cartoons, including &quot;The Grasshopper and the Ants&quot;, &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot;, &quot;The Goddess of Spring&quot; and &quot;Mother Pluto&quot;, but it also included non-&quot;Symphony&quot; cartoons like Mickey Mouse&#x27;s &quot;Brave Little Tailor&quot;. By the third issue, there was almost no &quot;Symphony&quot;-related material in the book; the stories and activities were mostly based on other Disney shorts and feature films.

<doc id="102352" wikidata="Q2102713" url="?curid=102352" title="Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis">
<text>Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) is a technique widely used in biochemistry, forensic chemistry, genetics, molecular biology and biotechnology to separate biological macromolecules, usually proteins or nucleic acids, according to their electrophoretic mobility. Electrophoretic mobility is a function of the length, conformation, and charge of the molecule. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is a powerful tool used to analyze RNA samples. When polyacrylamide gel is denatured after electrophoresis, it provides information on the sample composition of the RNA species.

Hydration of acrylonitrile results in formation of acrylamide molecules () by nitrile hydratase. Acrylamide monomer is in a powder state before addition of water. Acrylamide is toxic to the human nervous system, therefore all safety measures must be followed when working with it. Acrylamide is soluble in water and upon addition of free-radical initiators it polymerizes resulting in formation of polyacrylamide. It is useful to make polyacrylamide gel via acrylamide hydration because pore size can be regulated. Increased concentrations of acrylamide result in decreased pore size after polymerization. Polyacrylamide gel with small pores helps to examine smaller molecules better since the small molecules can enter the pores and travel through the gel while large molecules get trapped at the pore openings.

As with all forms of gel electrophoresis, molecules may be run in their native state, preserving the molecules&#x27; higher-order structure. This method is called native-PAGE. Alternatively, a chemical denaturant may be added to remove this structure and turn the molecule into an unstructured molecule whose mobility depends only on its length (because the protein-SDS complexes all have a similar mass-to-charge ratio). This procedure is called SDS-PAGE. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is a method of separating molecules based on the difference of their molecular weight. At the pH at which gel electrophoresis is carried out the SDS molecules are negatively charged and bind to proteins in a set ratio, approximately one molecule of SDS for every 2 amino acids. In this way, the detergent provides all proteins with a uniform charge-to-mass ratio. By binding to the proteins the detergent destroys their secondary, tertiary and/or quaternary structure denaturing them and turning them into negatively charged linear polypeptide chains. When subjected to an electric field in PAGE, the negatively charged polypeptide chains travel toward the anode with different mobility. Their mobility, or the distance traveled by molecules, is inversely proportional to the logarithm of their molecular weight. By comparing the relative ratio of the distance traveled by each protein to the length of the gel (Rf) one can make conclusions about the relative molecular weight of the proteins, where the length of the gel is determined by the distance traveled by a small molecule like a tracking dye.

For nucleic acids, urea is the most commonly used denaturant. For proteins, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is an anionic detergent applied to protein samples to coat proteins in order to impart two negative charges (from every SDS molecule) to every two amino acids of the denatured protein. 2-Mercaptoethanol may also be used to disrupt the disulfide bonds found between the protein complexes, which helps further denature the protein. In most proteins, the binding of SDS to the polypeptide chains impart an even distribution of charge per unit mass, thereby resulting in a fractionation by approximate size during electrophoresis. Proteins that have a greater hydrophobic content – for instance, many membrane proteins, and those that interact with surfactants in their native environment – are intrinsically harder to treat accurately using this method, due to the greater variability in the ratio of bound SDS. Procedurally, using both Native and SDS-PAGE together can be used to purify and to separate the various subunits of the protein. Native-PAGE keeps the oligomeric form intact and will show a band on the gel that is representative of the level of activity. SDS-PAGE will denature and separate the oligomeric form into its monomers, showing bands that are representative of their molecular weights. These bands can be used to identify and assess the purity of the protein.

== Procedure ==

=== Sample preparation ===
Samples may be any material containing proteins or nucleic acids. These may be biologically derived, for example from prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells, tissues, viruses, environmental samples, or purified proteins. In the case of solid tissues or cells, these are often first broken down mechanically using a blender (for larger sample volumes), using a homogenizer (smaller volumes), by sonicator or by using cycling of high pressure, and a combination of biochemical and mechanical techniques – including various types of filtration and centrifugation – may be used to separate different cell compartments and organelles prior to electrophoresis. Synthetic biomolecules such as oligonucleotides may also be used as analytes.

The sample to analyze is optionally mixed with a chemical denaturant if so desired, usually SDS for proteins or urea for nucleic acids. SDS is an anionic detergent that denatures secondary and non–disulfide–linked tertiary structures, and additionally applies a negative charge to each protein in proportion to its mass. Urea breaks the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs of the nucleic acid, causing the constituent strands to separate. Heating the samples to at least 60 °C further promotes denaturation.

In addition to SDS, proteins may optionally be briefly heated to near boiling in the presence of a reducing agent, such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or 2-mercaptoethanol (beta-mercaptoethanol/BME), which further denatures the proteins by reducing disulfide linkages, thus overcoming some forms of tertiary protein folding, and breaking up quaternary protein structure (oligomeric subunits). This is known as reducing SDS-PAGE.

A tracking dye may be added to the solution. This typically has a higher electrophoretic mobility than the analytes to allow the experimenter to track the progress of the solution through the gel during the electrophoretic run.

=== Preparing acrylamide gels ===
The gels typically consist of acrylamide, bisacrylamide, the optional denaturant (SDS or urea), and a buffer with an adjusted pH. The solution may be degassed under a vacuum to prevent the formation of air bubbles during polymerization. Alternatively, butanol may be added to the resolving gel (for proteins) after it is poured, as butanol removes bubbles and makes the surface smooth.

A source of free radicals and a stabilizer, such as ammonium persulfate and TEMED are added to initiate polymerization. The polymerization reaction creates a gel because of the added bisacrylamide, which can form cross-links between two acrylamide molecules. The ratio of bisacrylamide to acrylamide can be varied for special purposes, but is generally about 1 part in 35. The acrylamide concentration of the gel can also be varied, generally in the range from 5% to 25%. Lower percentage gels are better for resolving very high molecular weight molecules, while much higher percentages of acrylamide are needed to resolve smaller proteins. The average pore diameter of polyacrylamide gels is determined by the total concentration of acrylamides (% T with T = Total concentration of acrylamide and bisacrylamide) and the concentration of the cross-linker bisacrylamide (%C with C = bisacrylamide concentration).&lt;ref name=&quot;DOI10.1016/S0021-9673(00)95641-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The pore size is reduced reciprocally to the %T. Concerning %C, a concentration of 5% produces the smallest pores, since the influence of bisacrylamide on the pore size has a parabola-shape with a vertex at 5%.

Gels are usually polymerized between two glass plates in a gel caster, with a comb inserted at the top to create the sample wells. After the gel is polymerized the comb can be removed and the gel is ready for electrophoresis.

=== Electrophoresis ===
Various buffer systems are used in PAGE depending on the nature of the sample and the experimental objective. The buffers used at the anode and cathode may be the same or different.


An electric field is applied across the gel, causing the negatively charged proteins or nucleic acids to migrate across the gel away from the negative electrode (which is the cathode being that this is an electrolytic rather than galvanic cell) and towards the positive electrode (the anode). Depending on their size, each biomolecule moves differently through the gel matrix: small molecules more easily fit through the pores in the gel, while larger ones have more difficulty. The gel is run usually for a few hours, though this depends on the voltage applied across the gel; migration occurs more quickly at higher voltages, but these results are typically less accurate than at those at lower voltages. After the set amount of time, the biomolecules have migrated different distances based on their size. Smaller biomolecules travel farther down the gel, while larger ones remain closer to the point of origin. Biomolecules may therefore be separated roughly according to size, which depends mainly on molecular weight under denaturing conditions, but also depends on higher-order conformation under native conditions. The gel mobility is defined as the rate of migration traveled with a voltage gradient of 1V/cm and has units of cm2/sec/V. For analytical purposes, the relative mobility of biomolecules, &quot;Rf&quot;, the ratio of the distance the molecule traveled on the gel to the total travel distance of a tracking dye is plotted versus the molecular weight of the molecule (or sometimes the log of MW, or rather the Mr, molecular radius). Such typically linear plots represent the standard markers or calibration curves that are widely used for the quantitative estimation of a variety of biomolecular sizes.

Certain glycoproteins, however, behave anomalously on SDS gels. Additionally, the analysis of larger proteins ranging from 250,000 to 600,000 Da is also reported to be problematic due to the fact that such polypeptides move improperly in the normally used gel systems.

=== Further processing ===
Following electrophoresis, the gel may be stained (for proteins, most commonly with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 or autoradiography; for nucleic acids, ethidium bromide; or for either, silver stain), allowing visualization of the separated proteins, or processed further (e.g. Western blot). After staining, different species biomolecules appear as distinct bands within the gel. It is common to run molecular weight size markers of known molecular weight in a separate lane in the gel to calibrate the gel and determine the approximate molecular mass of unknown biomolecules by comparing the distance traveled relative to the marker.

For proteins, SDS-PAGE is usually the first choice as an assay of purity due to its reliability and ease. The presence of SDS and the denaturing step make proteins separate, approximately based on size, but aberrant migration of some proteins may occur. Different proteins may also stain differently, which interferes with quantification by staining. PAGE may also be used as a preparative technique for the purification of proteins. For example, preparative native PAGE is a method for separating native metalloproteins in complex biological matrices.

== Chemical ingredients and their roles ==
Polyacrylamide gel (PAG) had been known as a potential embedding medium for sectioning tissues as early as 1964, and two independent groups employed PAG in electrophoresis in 1959. It possesses several electrophoretically desirable features that make it a versatile medium. It is a synthetic, thermo-stable, transparent, strong, chemically relatively inert gel, and can be prepared with a wide range of average pore sizes. The pore size of a gel and the reproducibility in gel pore size are determined by three factors, the total amount of acrylamide present (%T) (T = Total concentration of acrylamide and bisacrylamide monomer), the amount of cross-linker (%C) (C = bisacrylamide concentration), and the time of polymerization of acrylamide (cf. QPNC-PAGE). Pore size decreases with increasing %T; with cross-linking, 5%C gives the smallest pore size. Any increase or decrease in %C from 5% increases the pore size, as pore size with respect to %C is a parabolic function with vertex as 5%C. This appears to be because of non-homogeneous bundling of polymer strands within the gel. This gel material can also withstand high voltage gradients, is amenable to various staining and destaining procedures, and can be digested to extract separated fractions or dried for autoradiography and permanent recording.

=== Components ===
Polyacrylamide gels are composed of a stacking gel and separating gel. Stacking gels have a higher porosity relative to the separating gel, and allow for proteins to migrate in a concentrated area. Additionally, stacking gels usually have a pH of 6.8, since the neutral glycine molecules allow for faster protein mobility. Separating gels have a pH of 8.8, where the anionic glycine slows down the mobility of proteins. Separating gels allow for the separation of proteins and have a relatively lower porosity. Here, the proteins are separated based on size (in SDS-PAGE) and size/ charge (Native PAGE).

Chemical buffer stabilizes the pH value to the desired value within the gel itself and in the electrophoresis buffer. The choice of buffer also affects the electrophoretic mobility of the buffer counterions and thereby the resolution of the gel. The buffer should also be unreactive and not modify or react with most proteins. Different buffers may be used as cathode and anode buffers, respectively, depending on the application. Multiple pH values may be used within a single gel, for example in DISC electrophoresis. Common buffers in PAGE include Tris, Bis-Tris, or imidazole.

Counterion balance the intrinsic charge of the buffer ion and also affect the electric field strength during electrophoresis. Highly charged and mobile ions are often avoided in SDS-PAGE cathode buffers, but may be included in the gel itself, where it migrates ahead of the protein. In applications such as DISC SDS-PAGE the pH values within the gel may vary to change the average charge of the counterions during the run to improve resolution. Popular counterions are glycine and tricine. Glycine has been used as the source of trailing ion or slow ion because its pKa is 9.69 and mobility of glycinate are such that the effective mobility can be set at a value below that of the slowest known proteins of net negative charge in the pH range. The minimum pH of this range is approximately 8.0.

Acrylamide (; mW: 71.08) when dissolved in water, slow, spontaneous autopolymerization of acrylamide takes place, joining molecules together by head on tail fashion to form long single-chain polymers. The presence of a free radical-generating system greatly accelerates polymerization. This kind of reaction is known as vinyl addition polymerisation. A solution of these polymer chains becomes viscous but does not form a gel, because the chains simply slide over one another. Gel formation requires linking various chains together. Acrylamide is carcinogenic, a neurotoxin, and a reproductive toxin. It is also essential to store acrylamide in a cool dark and dry place to reduce autopolymerisation and hydrolysis.

Bisacrylamide (&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;′-Methylenebisacrylamide) (; mW: 154.17) is the most frequently used cross linking agent for polyacrylamide gels. Chemically it can be thought of as two acrylamide molecules coupled head to head at their non-reactive ends. Bisacrylamide can crosslink two polyacrylamide chains to one another, thereby resulting in a gel.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (; mW: 288.38) (only used in denaturing protein gels) is a strong detergent agent used to denature native proteins to individual polypeptides. This denaturation, which is referred to as reconstructive denaturation, is not accomplished by the total linearization of the protein, but instead, through a conformational change to a combination of random coil and α helix secondary structures. When a protein mixture is heated to 100 °C in presence of SDS, the detergent wraps around the polypeptide backbone. It binds to polypeptides in a constant weight ratio of 1.4 g SDS/g of polypeptide. In this process, the intrinsic charges of polypeptides become negligible when compared to the negative charges contributed by SDS. Thus polypeptides after treatment become rod-like structures possessing a uniform charge density, that is same net negative charge per unit weight. The electrophoretic mobilities of these proteins is a linear function of the logarithms of their molecular weights. Without SDS, different proteins with similar molecular weights would migrate differently due to differences in mass-charge ratio, as each protein has an isoelectric point and molecular weight particular to its primary structure. This is known as native PAGE. Adding SDS solves this problem, as it binds to and unfolds the protein, giving a near uniform negative charge along the length of the polypeptide.

Urea (; mW: 60.06) is a chaotropic agent that increases the entropy of the system by interfering with intramolecular interactions mediated by non-covalent forces such as hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces. Macromolecular structure is dependent on the net effect of these forces, therefore it follows that an increase in chaotropic solutes denatures macromolecules,

Ammonium persulfate (APS) (; mW: 228.2) is a source of free radicals and is often used as an initiator for gel formation. An alternative source of free radicals is riboflavin, which generated free radicals in a photochemical reaction.

TEMED (&quot;N&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;N&quot;′, &quot;N&quot;′-tetramethylethylenediamine) (; mW: 116.21) stabilizes free radicals and improves polymerization. The rate of polymerisation and the properties of the resulting gel depend on the concentrations of free radicals. Increasing the amount of free radicals results in a decrease in the average polymer chain length, an increase in gel turbidity and a decrease in gel elasticity. Decreasing the amount shows the reverse effect. The lowest catalytic concentrations that allow polymerisation in a reasonable period of time should be used. APS and TEMED are typically used at approximately equimolar concentrations in the range of 1 to 10 mM.

=== Chemicals for processing and visualization ===

The following chemicals and procedures are used for processing of the gel and the protein samples visualized in it.

Tracking dye; as proteins and nucleic acids are mostly colorless, their progress through the gel during electrophoresis cannot be easily followed. Anionic dyes of a known electrophoretic mobility are therefore usually included in the PAGE sample buffer. A very common tracking dye is Bromophenol blue (BPB, 3&#x27;,3&quot;,5&#x27;,5&quot; tetrabromophenolsulfonphthalein). This dye is coloured at alkali and neutral pH and is a small negatively charged molecule that moves towards the anode. Being a highly mobile molecule it moves ahead of most proteins. As it reaches the anodic end of the electrophoresis medium electrophoresis is stopped. It can weakly bind to some proteins and impart a blue colour. Other common tracking dyes are xylene cyanol, which has lower mobility, and Orange G, which has a higher mobility.

Loading aids; most PAGE systems are loaded from the top into wells within the gel. To ensure that the sample sinks to the bottom of the gel, sample buffer is supplemented with additives that increase the density of the sample. These additives should be non-ionic and non-reactive towards proteins to avoid interfering with electrophoresis. Common additives are glycerol and sucrose.

Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (CBB)(; mW: 825.97) is the most popular protein stain. It is an anionic dye, which non-specifically binds to proteins. The structure of CBB is predominantly non-polar, and it is usually used in methanolic solution acidified with acetic acid. Proteins in the gel are fixed by acetic acid and simultaneously stained. The excess dye incorporated into the gel can be removed by destaining with the same solution without the dye. The proteins are detected as blue bands on a clear background. As SDS is also anionic, it may interfere with staining process. Therefore, large volume of staining solution is recommended, at least ten times the volume of the gel.

Ethidium bromide (EtBr) is a popular nucleic acid stain. EtBr allows one to easily visualize DNA or RNA on a gel as EtBr fluoresces an orange color under UV light. Ethidium bromide binds nucleic acid chains through the process of Intercalation. While Ethidium bromide is a popular stain it is important to exercise caution when using EtBr as it is a known carcinogen. Because of this fact, many researchers opt to use stains such as SYBR Green and SYBR Safe which are safer alternatives to EtBr. EtBr is used by simply adding it to the gel mixture. Once the gel has run, the gel may be viewed through the use of a photo-documentation system.

Silver staining is used when more sensitive method for detection is needed, as classical Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining can usually detect a 50 ng protein band, Silver staining increases the sensitivity typically 10-100 fold more. This is based on the chemistry of photographic development. The proteins are fixed to the gel with a dilute methanol solution, then incubated with an acidic silver nitrate solution. Silver ions are reduced to their metallic form by formaldehyde at alkaline pH. An acidic solution, such as acetic acid stops development. Silver staining was introduced by Kerenyi and Gallyas as a sensitive procedure to detect trace amounts of proteins in gels. The technique has been extended to the study of other biological macromolecules that have been separated in a variety of supports. Many variables can influence the colour intensity and every protein has its own staining characteristics; clean glassware, pure reagents and water of highest purity are the key points to successful staining. Silver staining was developed in the 14th century for colouring the surface of glass. It has been used extensively for this purpose since the 16th century. The colour produced by the early silver stains ranged between light yellow and an orange-red. Camillo Golgi perfected the silver staining for the study of the nervous system. Golgi&#x27;s method stains a limited number of cells at random in their entirety.

Autoradiography, also used for protein band detection post gel electrophoresis, uses radioactive isotopes to label proteins, which are then detected by using X-ray film.

Western blotting is a process by which proteins separated in the acrylamide gel are electrophoretically transferred to a stable, manipulable membrane such as a nitrocellulose, nylon, or PVDF membrane. It is then possible to apply immunochemical techniques to visualise the transferred proteins, as well as accurately identify relative increases or decreases of the protein of interest.

<doc id="102354" wikidata="Q273053" url="?curid=102354" title="Papias of Hierapolis">
<text>Papias () was a Greek Apostolic Father, Bishop of Hierapolis (modern Pamukkale, Turkey), and author who lived c. 60 – c. 130 AD He wrote the &quot;Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord&quot; () in five books. This work, which is lost apart from brief excerpts in the works of Irenaeus of Lyons () and Eusebius of Caesarea (), is an important early source on Christian oral tradition and especially on the origins of the canonical Gospels.

==Life==
Very little is known of Papias apart from what can be inferred from his own writings. He is described as &quot;an ancient man who was a hearer of John and a companion of Polycarp&quot; by Polycarp&#x27;s disciple Irenaeus (c. 180).

Eusebius adds that Papias was Bishop of Hierapolis around the time of Ignatius of Antioch. In this office Papias was presumably succeeded by Abercius of Hierapolis.

The name &quot;Papias&quot; was very common in the region, suggesting that he was probably a native of the area.

==Date==

The work of Papias is dated by a few modern scholars to about 95–110. Later dates were once argued from two references that now appear to be mistaken. One dating Papias&#x27; death to around the death of Polycarp in 164 is actually a mistake for &quot;Papylas&quot;. Another unreliable source in which Papias is said to refer to the reign of Hadrian (117–138) seems to have resulted from confusion between Papias and Quadratus of Athens.

Eusebius refers to Papias only in his third book, and thus seems to date him before the opening of his fourth book in 109. Papias himself knows several New Testament books, whose dates are themselves controversial, and was informed by John the Evangelist, Aristion, the daughters of Philip and others who had themselves heard the Twelve Apostles. He is also called a companion of the long-lived Polycarp (69–155), Agapius of Hierapolis dates one of his histories to the 12th year of Trajan&#x27;s rule (110 AD). For all these reasons, Papias is thought to have written around the turn of the 2nd century.

==Sources==

Papias describes his way of gathering information in his preface:

Papias, then, inquired of travelers passing through Hierapolis what the surviving disciples of Jesus and the elders—those who had personally known the Twelve Apostles—were saying. One of these disciples was Aristion, probably bishop of nearby Smyrna, and another was John the Elder, usually identified (despite Eusebius&#x27; protest) with John the Evangelist, residing in nearby Ephesus, of whom Papias was a hearer; Papias frequently cited both. From the daughters of Philip, who settled in Hierapolis, Papias learned still other traditions.

There is some debate about the intention of Papias&#x27; last sentence in the above quotation, &quot;For I did not think that information from the books would profit me as much as information from a living and surviving voice.&quot; One side of the debate holds with the longstanding opinion of 20th-century scholarship that in Papias&#x27; day written statements were held at a lower value than oral statements. The other side observes that &quot;living voice&quot; was a topos, an established phrase referring to personal instruction and apprenticeship, and thus Papias indicates his preference for personal instruction over isolated book learning.

==Fragments==

Despite indications that the work of Papias was still extant in the late Middle Ages, the full text is now lost. Extracts, however, appear in a number of other writings, some of which cite a book number. MacDonald proposes the following tentative reconstruction of the five books, following a presumed Matthaean order.

=== Gospel origins ===


Papias provides the earliest extant account of who wrote the Gospels. Eusebius preserves two (possibly) verbatim excerpts from Papias on the origins of the Gospels, one concerning Mark and then another concerning Matthew.

On Mark, Papias cites John the Elder:
The excerpt regarding Matthew says only:
How to interpret these quotations from Papias has long been a matter of controversy, as the original context for each is missing and the Greek is in several respects ambiguous and seems to employ technical rhetorical terminology. It has been questioned if Papias is even referring to the canonical Gospels bearing those names. However Eusebius, who had the complete text and context before him, understood Papias in these passages to be referring to the canonical Gospels.

The word &quot;logia&quot; (&quot;&quot;)—which also appears in the title of Papias&#x27; work—is itself problematic. In non-Christian contexts, the usual meaning was &quot;oracles&quot;, but since the 19th century it has been interpreted as &quot;sayings&quot;, which sparked numerous theories about a lost &quot;Sayings Gospel&quot;, now called &quot;Q&quot;, resembling the Gospel of Thomas. But the parallelism implies a meaning of &quot;things said or done&quot;, which suits the canonical Gospels well.

The apparent claim that Matthew wrote in Hebrew—which in Greek could refer to either Hebrew or Aramaic—is echoed by many other ancient authorities. Modern scholars have proposed numerous explanations for this assertion, in light of the prevalent view that canonical Matthew was composed in Greek and not translated from Semitic. One theory is that Matthew himself produced firstly a Semitic work and secondly a recension of that work in Greek. Another is that others translated Matthew into Greek rather freely. Another is that Papias simply means &quot;Ἑβραΐδι διαλέκτῳ&quot; as a &quot;Hebrew style&quot; of Greek. Another is that Papias refers to a distinct work now lost, perhaps a sayings collection like Q or the so-called Gospel according to the Hebrews. Yet another is that Papias was simply mistaken.

As for Mark, the difficulty has been in understanding the relationship described between Mark and Peter—whether Peter recalled from memory or Mark recalled Peter&#x27;s preaching, and whether Mark translated this preaching into Greek or Latin or merely expounded on it, and if the former, publicly or just when composing the Gospel; modern scholars have explored a range of possibilities. Eusebius, after quoting Papias, goes on to say that Papias also cited 1 Peter, where Peter speaks of &quot;my son Mark&quot;, as corroboration. Within the 2nd century, this relation of Peter to Mark&#x27;s Gospel is alluded to by Justin and expanded on by Clement of Alexandria.

We do not know what else Papias said about these or the other Gospels—he certainly treated John—but some see Papias as the likely unattributed source of at least two later accounts of the Gospel origins. Bauckham argues that the Muratorian Canon (c. 170) has drawn from Papias; the extant fragment, however, preserves only a few final words on Mark and then speaks about Luke and John. Hill argues that Eusebius&#x27; earlier account of the origins of the four Gospels is also drawn from Papias.

===Eschatological===

Eusebius concludes from the writings of Papias that he was a chiliast, understanding the Millennium as a literal period in which Christ will reign on Earth, and chastises Papias for his literal interpretation of figurative passages, writing that Papias &quot;appears to have been of very limited understanding&quot;, and felt that his misunderstanding misled Irenaeus and others.

Irenaeus indeed quotes the fourth book of Papias for an otherwise-unknown saying of Jesus, recounted by John the Evangelist, which Eusebius doubtless has in mind:

Parallels have often been noted between this account and Jewish texts of the period such as 2 Baruch.

On the other hand, Papias is elsewhere said to have understood mystically the Hexaemeron (six days of Creation) as referring to Christ and the Church.

===Pericope Adulterae===

Eusebius concludes his account of Papias by saying that he relates &quot;another account about a woman who was accused of many sins before the Lord, which is found in the Gospel according to the Hebrews&quot;. Agapius of Hierapolis (10th century) offers a fuller summary of what Papias said here, calling the woman an adulteress. The parallel is clear to the famous Pericope Adulterae (), a problematic passage absent or relocated in many ancient Gospel manuscripts. The parallel is not exact since, in the version known to Papias, the woman &quot;was accused of many sins&quot;, unlike the account found in the Pericope Adulterae in which her accusers simply say that she was &quot;caught in the act of adultery.&quot; The remarkable fact is that the story is known in some form to such an ancient witness as Papias.

What is less clear is to what extent Eusebius and Agapius are reporting the words of Papias versus the form of the pericope known to them from elsewhere. A wide range of versions have come down to us, in fact. Since the passage in John is virtually unknown to the Greek patristic tradition; Eusebius has cited the only parallel he recognized, from the now-lost Gospel according to the Hebrews, which may be the version quoted by Didymus the Blind.

The nearest agreement with &quot;many sins&quot; actually occurs in the Johannine text of Armenian codex Matenadaran 2374 (formerly Ečmiadzin 229); this codex is also remarkable for ascribing the longer ending of Mark to &quot;Ariston the Elder&quot;, which is often seen as somehow connected with Papias.

===Death of Judas===

According to a scholium attributed to Apollinaris of Laodicea, Papias also related a tale on the grotesque fate of Judas Iscariot:

===Death of John===

Two late sources (Philip of Side and George Hamartolus) cite the second book of Papias as claiming that John was killed by the Jews. However, some modern scholars doubt the reliability of the two sources regarding Papias, while others argue that Papias did speak of John&#x27;s martyrdom. According to the two sources, Papias presented this as fulfillment of the prophecy of Jesus on the martyrdom of these two brothers.

===Barsabbas===

Papias relates, on the authority of the daughters of Philip, an event concerning Justus Barsabbas, who according to Acts was one of two candidates proposed to join the Twelve Apostles. The summary in Eusebius tells us that he &quot;drank a deadly poison and suffered no harm,&quot; while Philip of Side recounts that he &quot;drank snake venom in the name of Christ when put to the test by unbelievers and was protected from all harm.&quot; The account about Justus Barsabbas is followed by a one about the resurrection of the mother of a certain Manaem. This account may be connected to a verse from the longer ending of Mark: &quot;They will pick up snakes in their hands, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them.&quot;

==Reliability==
Eusebius had a &quot;low esteem of Papias&#x27; intellect&quot;, but knew that Irenaeus believed Papias to be a reliable witness to original apostolic traditions.

Eusebius’ use of sources suggests that he himself did not always exercise the soundest of critical judgement, and his negative assessment of Papias was in all likelihood dictated simply by a distrust of chiliasm.

Modern scholars have debated Papias&#x27; reliability. Much discussion of Papias&#x27;s comments about the Gospel of Mark and Gospel of Matthew is concerned with either showing their reliability as evidence for the origins of these Gospels or with emphasizing their apologetic character in order to discredit their reliability. Yoon-Man Park cites a modern argument that Papias&#x27;s tradition was formulated to vindicate the apostolicity of Mark&#x27;s Gospel, but dismisses this as an unlikely apologetic route unless the Peter-Mark connection Papias described had already been accepted with general agreement by the early church. Maurice Casey argued that Papias was indeed reliable about a Hebrew collection of sayings by Matthew the Apostle, which he argues was independent of the Greek Gospel of Matthew, possibly written by another Matthew or Matthias in the early church.

Others argue Papias faithfully recorded what was related to him, but misunderstood the subjects of narrations he was unfamiliar with.

<text>Edward Morley Callaghan (February 22, 1903 – August 25, 1990) was a Canadian novelist, short story writer, playwright, and TV and radio personality.

==Biography==

Of Canadian/English-immigrant parentage, Callaghan was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. In his youth, he played baseball for Canadian Sports Hall of Fame coach, Bob Abate, and pitched for Abate&#x27;s Arlington baseball team. He was educated at Withrow PS, Riverdale Collegiate Institute, the University of Toronto and Osgoode Hall Law School. He articled and was called to the Bar, but did not practice law. During the 1920s he worked at the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; where he became friends with a fellow reporter Ernest Hemingway, formerly of &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot;. Callaghan began writing stories that were well received and soon were recognized as one of the best short story writers of the day. In 1929 he spent some months in Paris, where he was part of the great gathering of writers in Montparnasse that included Ernest Hemingway, Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and James Joyce.

Callaghan&#x27;s novels and short stories are marked by undertones of Roman Catholicism, often focusing on individuals whose essential characteristic is a strong but often weakened sense of self. His first novel was &quot;Strange Fugitive&quot; (1928); several short stories, novellas, and novels followed. Callaghan published little between 1937 and 1950 - an artistically dry period. However, during these years, many non-fiction articles were written in various periodicals such as &quot;New World&quot; (Toronto), and &quot;National Home Monthly&quot;. &quot;Luke Baldwin&#x27;s Vow&quot;, a slim novel about a boy and his dog, was originally published in a 1947 edition of &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; and soon became a juvenile classic read in school rooms around the world. &quot;The Loved and the Lost&quot; (1951) won the Governor General&#x27;s Award. Callaghan&#x27;s later works include, among others, &quot;The Many Colored Coat&quot; (1960), &quot;A Passion in Rome&quot; (1961), &quot;A Fine and Private Place&quot; (1975), &quot;A Time for Judas&quot; (1983), &quot;Our Lady of the Snows&quot; (1985). His last novel was &quot;A Wild Old Man Down the Road&quot; (1988). Publications of short stories have appeared in &quot;The Lost and Found Stories of Morley Callaghan&quot; (1985) and in &quot;The New Yorker Stories&quot; (2001). The four-volume &quot;The Complete Stories&quot; (2003) collects for the first time 90 of his stories.

Callaghan was also a contributor to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;Yale Review&quot;, &quot;New World&quot;, &quot;Performing Arts in Canada&quot;, and &quot;Twentieth Century Literature&quot;.

Callaghan married Loretto Dee, with whom he had two sons: Michael (born November 1931) and Barry (born 1937), a poet and author in his own right. Barry Callaghan&#x27;s memoir &quot;Barrelhouse Kings&quot; (1998), examines his career and that of his father. After outliving most of his contemporaries, Callaghan died after a brief illness in Toronto at the age of 87. He was interred in Mount Hope Catholic Cemetery in Ontario. 

===Recognition===

Callaghan was awarded the Royal Society of Canada&#x27;s Lorne Pierce Medal in 1960. In 1982 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.

Morley Callaghan is the subject of a CBC Television &quot;Life and Times&quot; episode, and the CBC mini-series, &quot;Hemingway Vs. Callaghan&quot;, which first aired in March 2003.

From 1951 until he died in 1990, the author had lived in the Rosedale, Toronto area, at 20 Dale Avenue. A historic plaque at the nearby Glen Road footbridge summarizes Callaghan&#x27;s noteworthy writing career and the most significant of his literary contemporaries, including Ernest Hemingway and F Scott Fitzgerald. 

====Commemorative postage stamp====
On September 8, 2003, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the National Library of Canada, Canada Post released a special commemorative series, &quot;The Writers of Canada&quot;, with a design by Katalina Kovats, featuring two English-Canadian and two French-Canadian stamps. Three million stamps were issued. Callaghan was chosen for one of the English-Canadian stamps.

<doc id="102359" wikidata="Q191341" url="?curid=102359" title="Pulmonary alveolus">
<text>A pulmonary alveolus (; ), also called an air sac or air space, is one of millions of hollow, distensible cup-shaped cavities in the lungs where pulmonary gas exchange takes place. Oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide at the blood–air barrier between the alveolar air and the pulmonary capillary. Alveoli make up the functional tissue of the mammalian lungs known as the lung parenchyma, which takes up 90 percent of the total lung volume.

Alveoli are first located in the respiratory bronchioles that mark the beginning of the respiratory zone. They are located sparsely in these bronchioles, line the walls of the alveolar ducts, and are more numerous in the blind-ended alveolar sacs. The acini are the basic units of respiration, with gas exchange taking place in all the alveoli present. The alveolar membrane is the gas exchange surface, surrounded by a network of capillaries. Oxygen is diffused across the membrane into the capillaries and carbon dioxide is released from the capillaries into the alveoli to be breathed out.

Alveoli are particular to mammalian lungs. Different structures are involved in gas exchange in other vertebrates.

== Structure ==

The alveoli are first located in the respiratory bronchioles as scattered outpockets, extending from their lumens. The respiratory bronchioles run for considerable lengths and become increasingly alveolated with side branches of alveolar ducts that become deeply lined with alveoli. The ducts number between two and eleven from each bronchiole. Each duct opens into five or six alveolar sacs into which clusters of alveoli open.

Each terminal respiratory unit is called an acinus and consists of the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. New alveoli continue to form until the age of eight years.

A typical pair of human lungs contains about 480 million alveoli, providing a total surface area for gas exchange of between 70 and 80 square metres. Each alveolus is wrapped in a fine mesh of capillaries covering about 70% of its area. The diameter of an alveolus is between 200 and 500 μm.

=== Microanatomy ===
An alveolus consists of an epithelial layer of simple squamous epithelium (very thin, flattened cells), and an extracellular matrix surrounded by capillaries. The epithelial lining is part of the alveolar membrane, also known as the respiratory membrane, that allows the exchange of gases. The membrane has several layers – a layer of alveolar lining fluid that contains surfactant, the epithelial layer and its basement membrane; a thin interstitial space between the epithelial lining and the capillary membrane; a capillary basement membrane that often fuses with the alveolar basement membrane, and the capillary endothelial membrane. The whole membrane however is only between 0.2 μm at its thinnest part and 0.6 μm at its thickest.

In the alveolar walls there are interconnecting air passages between the alveoli known as the pores of Kohn. The alveolar septum that separates the alveoli in the alveolar sac contains some collagen fibers and elastic fibers. The septa also house the enmeshed capillary network that surrounds each alveolus. The elastic fibres allow the alveoli to stretch when they fill with air during inhalation. They then spring back during exhalation in order to expel the carbon dioxide-rich air.
There are three major types of alveolar cell. Two types are pneumocytes or pneumonocytes known as type I and type II cells found in the alveolar wall, and a large phagocytic cell known as an alveolar macrophage that moves about in the lumens of the alveoli, and in the connective tissue between them. Type I cells, also called type I pneumocytes, or type I alveolar cells, are squamous, thin and flat and form the structure of the alveoli. Type II cells, also called type II pneumocytes or type II alveolar cells, release pulmonary surfactant to lower surface tension, and can also differentiate to replace damaged type I cells.

== Development ==
Development of the earliest structures that will contain alveoli begins on day 22 and is divided into five stages: embryonic, pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular, and alveolar stage. The alveolar stage begins approximately 36 weeks into development. Immature alveoli appear as bulges from the sacculi which invade the primary septa. As the sacculi develop, the protrusions in the primary septa become larger; new septations are longer and thinner and are known as secondary septa. Secondary septa are responsible for the final division of the sacculi into alveoli. Majority of alveolar division occurs within the first 6 months but continue to develop until 3 years of age. To create a thinner diffusion barrier, the double-layer capillary network fuse into one network, each one closely associated with two alveoli as they develop.

In the first three years of life, the enlargement of lungs is a consequence of the increasing number of alveoli; after this point, both the number and size of alveoli increases until the development of lungs finishes at approximately 8 years of age.

== Function ==
===Type I cells===
Type I cells are the larger of the two cell types; they are thin, flat epithelial lining cells (membranous pneumocytes), that form the structure of the alveoli. They are squamous (giving more surface area to each cell) and have long cytoplasmic extensions that cover more than 95% of the alveolar surface.

Type I cells are involved in the process of gas exchange between the alveoli and blood. These cells are extremely thin – sometimes only 25 nm – the electron microscope was needed to prove that all alveoli are lined with epithelium. This thin lining enables a fast diffusion of gas exchange between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the surrounding capillaries.

The nucleus of a type I cell occupies a large area of free cytoplasm and its organelles are clustered around it reducing the thickness of the cell. This also keeps the thickness of the blood-air barrier reduced to a minimum.

The cytoplasm in the thin portion contains pinocytotic vesicles which may play a role in the removal of small particulate contaminants from the outer surface. In addition to desmosomes, all type I alveolar cells have occluding junctions that prevent the leakage of tissue fluid into the alveolar air space.

The relatively low solubility (and hence rate of diffusion) of oxygen necessitates the large internal surface area (about 80 square m [96 square yards]) and very thin walls of the alveoli. Weaving between the capillaries and helping to support them is an extracellular matrix, a meshlike fabric of elastic and collagenous fibres. The collagen fibres, being more rigid, give the wall firmness, while the elastic fibres permit expansion and contraction of the walls during breathing.

Type I pneumocytes are unable to replicate and are susceptible to toxic insults. In the event of damage, type II cells can proliferate and differentiate into type I cells to compensate.

===Type II cells===
Type II cells are cuboidal and much smaller than type I cells. They are the most numerous cells in the alveoli, yet do not cover as much surface area as the squamous type I cells. Type II cells (granulous pneumocytes) in the alveolar wall contain secretory organelles known as lamellar bodies or lamellar granules, that fuse with the cell membranes and secrete pulmonary surfactant. This surfactant is a film of fatty substances, a group of phospholipids that reduce alveolar surface tension. The phospholipids are stored in the lamellar bodies. Without this coating, the alveoli would collapse. The surfactant is continuously released by exocytosis. Reinflation of the alveoli following exhalation is made easier by the surfactant, which reduces surface tension in the thin fluid lining of the alveoli. The fluid coating is produced by the body in order to facilitate the transfer of gases between blood and alveolar air, and the type II cells are typically found at the blood–air barrier.

Type II cells start to develop at about 26 weeks of gestation, secreting small amounts of surfactant. However, adequate amounts of surfactant are not secreted until about 35 weeks of gestation – this is the main reason for increased rates of infant respiratory distress syndrome, which drastically reduces at ages above 35 weeks gestation.

Type II cells are also capable of cellular division, giving rise to more type I and II alveolar cells when the lung tissue is damaged.

&quot;MUC1&quot;, a human gene associated with type II pneumocytes, has been identified as a marker in lung cancer.

The importance of the type 2 lung alveolar cells in the development of severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 and potential mechanisms on how these cells are protected by the SSRIs fluvoxamine and fluoxetine was summarized in a review in April 2022.

===Alveolar macrophages===
The alveolar macrophages reside on the internal luminal surfaces of the alveoli, the alveolar ducts, and the bronchioles. They are mobile scavengers that serve to engulf foreign particles in the lungs, such as dust, bacteria, carbon particles, and blood cells from injuries. They are also called &quot;pulmonary macrophages&quot;, and &quot;dust cells&quot;. Alveolar macrophages also play a crucial role in immune responses against viral pathogens in the lungs. They secrete cytokines and chemokines, which recruit and activate other immune cells, initiate type I interferon signaling, and inhibit the nuclear export of viral genomes. 

==Clinical significance==

===Diseases===
====Surfactant====
Insufficient surfactant in the alveoli is one of the causes that can contribute to atelectasis (collapse of part or all of the lung). Without pulmonary surfactant, atelectasis is a certainty. The severe condition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of surfactant. Insufficient surfactant in the lungs of preterm infants causes infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS). The lecithin–sphingomyelin ratio is a measure of fetal amniotic fluid to indicate lung maturity or immaturity. A low ratio indicates a risk factor for IRDS. Lecithin and sphingomyelin are two of the glycolipids of pulmonary surfactant.

Impaired surfactant regulation can cause an accumulation of surfactant proteins to build up in the alveoli in a condition called pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. This results in impaired gas exchange.

====Inflammation====
Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung tissue, which can be caused by both viruses and bacteria. Cytokines and fluids are released into the alveolar cavity, interstitium, or both, in response to infection, causing the effective surface area of gas exchange to be reduced. In severe cases where cellular respiration cannot be maintained, supplemental oxygen may be required.
* Diffuse alveolar damage can be a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) a severe inflammatory disease of the lung.
* In asthma, the bronchioles become narrowed, causing the amount of air flow into the lung tissue to be greatly reduced. It can be triggered by irritants in the air, photochemical smog for example, as well as substances to which a person is allergic.
* Chronic bronchitis occurs when an abundance of mucus is produced by the lungs. The production of mucus occurs naturally when the lung tissue is exposed to irritants. In chronic bronchitis, the air passages into the alveoli, the respiratory bronchioles, become clogged with mucus. This causes increased coughing in order to remove the mucus, and is often a result of extended periods of exposure to cigarette smoke.
* Hypersensitivity pneumonitis

====Structural====
Almost any type of lung tumor or lung cancer can compress the alveoli and reduce gas exchange capacity. In some cases the tumor will fill the alveoli.
* Cavitary pneumonia is a process in which the alveoli are destroyed and produce a cavity. As the alveoli are destroyed, the surface area for gas exchange to occur becomes reduced. Further changes in blood flow can lead to decline in lung function.
* Emphysema is another disease of the lungs, whereby the elastin in the walls of the alveoli is broken down by an imbalance between the production of neutrophil elastase (elevated by cigarette smoke) and alpha-1 antitrypsin (the activity varies due to genetics or reaction of a critical methionine residue with toxins including cigarette smoke). The resulting loss of elasticity in the lungs leads to prolonged times for exhalation, which occurs through passive recoil of the expanded lung. This leads to a smaller volume of gas exchanged per breath.
* Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is a rare lung disorder of small stone formation in the alveoli.
* Several factors, including smoking, viral infections, and aging, contribute to physical damage to type II alveolar cells. Some studies have linked injury to these cells to the proliferation of fibrosis in the lungs and the onset of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

====Fluid====
A pulmonary contusion is a bruise of the lung tissue caused by trauma. Damaged capillaries from a contusion can cause blood and other fluids to accumulate in the tissue of the lung, impairing gas exchange.

Pulmonary edema is the buildup of fluid in the parenchyma and alveoli. An edema is usually caused by left ventricular heart failure, or by damage to the lung or its vasculature.

==== Coronavirus ====

Because of the high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in type II alveolar cells, the lungs are susceptible to infections by some coronaviruses including the viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

<text>The rules of Go govern the play of the game of Go, a two-player board game. The rules have seen some variation over time and from place to place. This article discusses those sets of rules broadly similar to the ones currently in use in East Asia. Even among these, there is a degree of variation.

Notably, Chinese and Japanese rules differ in a number of aspects. The most significant of these are the scoring method, together with attendant differences in the manner of ending the game.

While differences between sets of rules may have moderate strategic consequences on occasion, they do not change the character of the game. The different sets of rules usually lead to the same game result, so long as the players make minor adjustments near the end of the game. Differences in the rules are said to cause problems in perhaps one in every 10,000 games in competition.

This article first presents a simple set of rules which are, except for wording, identical to those usually referred to as the Tromp–Taylor Rules, themselves close in most essential respects to the Chinese rules. These rules are then discussed at length, in a way that does not assume prior knowledge of Go on the part of the reader. The discussion is for the most part applicable to all sets of rules, with exceptions noted. Later sections of the article address major areas of variation in the rules of Go, and individual sets of rules.

== Basic rules ==
A set of rules suitable for beginners is presented here. The rules are studied more fully in below.

Two statements of the same basic rules, differing only in wording, are given here. The first is a concise one due to James Davies. The second is a formulation of the basic rules used for expository purposes in this article.

Except for terminology, the basic rules are identical to the Logical Rules first proposed in their current form in September 1996 by John Tromp and Bill Taylor. They are also quite close to the Simplified Ing Rules of the European Go Federation, the only exception being the method of ending the game.

=== Concise statement ===
These rules appear in &quot;The Rules and Elements of Go&quot; by James Davies. They assume familiarity with the equipment used to play Go, for which one may refer to below.

&quot;Notes:&quot; The words &quot;move&quot; and &quot;territory&quot; are used differently here than elsewhere in this article; &quot;play&quot; and &quot;area&quot;, respectively, are used instead. A clarification to rule 5 is added in parentheses.
# The board is empty at the onset of the game (unless players agree to place a handicap). 
# Black makes the first move, after which White and Black alternate.
# A move consists of placing one stone of one&#x27;s own color on an empty intersection on the board.
# A player may pass their turn at any time. 
# A stone or solidly connected group of stones of one color is captured and removed from the board when all the intersections directly adjacent to it are occupied by the enemy. (Capture of the enemy takes precedence over self-capture.)
# If a stone or solidly connected group of stones of one color is enclosed and will eventually be captured, they are removed as captured at the end of the game.
# No stone may be played so as to recreate a former board position.
# Two consecutive passes end the game.
# A player&#x27;s area consists of all the points the player has either occupied or surrounded.
# The player with more area wins.

These rules rely on common sense to make notions such as &quot;connected group&quot; and &quot;surround&quot; precise. What is here called a &quot;solidly connected group of stones&quot; is also called a &quot;chain&quot;.

===Reference statement===
The basic rules are formulated here in a more detailed way to ease their presentation in below. (Each rule and definition links to a detailed explanation in that section.)

An optional rule prohibiting suicide is included as Rule 7A.

====Players and equipment====
* Rule 1. Players: Go is a game between two players, called Black and White.
* Rule 2. Board: Go is played on a plain grid of 19 horizontal and 19 vertical lines, called a &quot;board&quot;.
** Definition.(&quot;Intersection&quot;, &quot;Adjacent&quot;) A point on the board where a horizontal line meets a vertical line is called an &quot;intersection&quot;. Two intersections are said to be &quot;adjacent&quot; if they are connected by a horizontal or vertical line with no other intersections between them.
* Rule 3. Stones: Go is played with playing tokens known as &quot;stones&quot;. Each player has at their disposal an adequate supply (usually 180) of stones of the same color.

====Positions====
* Rule 4. Positions: At any time in the game, each intersection on the board is in one and only one of the following three states: 1) empty; 2) occupied by a black stone; or 3) occupied by a white stone. A &quot;position&quot; consists of an indication of the state of each intersection. 
** Definition. (&quot;Connected&quot;) Two placed stones of the same color (or two empty intersections) are said to be &quot;connected&quot; if it is possible to draw a path from one intersection to the other by passing through adjacent intersections of the same state (empty, occupied by white, or occupied by black).
** Definition. (&quot;Liberty&quot;) In a given position, a &quot;liberty&quot; of a stone is an empty intersection adjacent to that stone or adjacent to a stone which is connected to that stone.

====Play====
* Rule 5. Initial position: At the beginning of the game, the board is empty.
* Rule 6. Turns: Black moves first. The players alternate thereafter.
* Rule 7. Moving: When it is their turn, a player may either &quot;pass&quot; (by announcing &quot;pass&quot; and performing no action) or &quot;play&quot;. A play consists of the following steps (performed in the prescribed order):
** Step 1. (Playing a stone) Placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection (chosen subject to Rule 8 and, if it is in effect, to Optional Rule 7A). It can never be moved to another intersection after being played.
** Step 2. (Capture) Removing from the board any stones of their opponent&#x27;s color that have no liberties. 
** Step 3. (Self-capture) Removing from the board any stones of their own color that have no liberties. 
* &quot;Optional Rule 7A.&quot; &quot;Prohibition of suicide: A play is illegal if one or more stones of that player&#x27;s color would be removed in Step 3 of that play.&quot;
* Rule 8. Prohibition of repetition: A play is illegal if it would have the effect (after all steps of the play have been completed) of creating a position that has occurred previously in the game.

====End====
* Rule 9. End: The game ends when both players have passed consecutively. The &quot;final position&quot; is the position on the board at the time the players pass consecutively.
** Definition. (&quot;Territory&quot;) In the final position, an empty intersection is said to belong to a player&#x27;s &quot;territory&quot; if all stones adjacent to it or to an empty intersection connected to it are of that player&#x27;s color.
** Definition. (&quot;Area&quot;) In the final position, an intersection is said to belong to a player&#x27;s &quot;area&quot; if either: 1) it belongs to that player&#x27;s territory; or 2) it is occupied by a stone of that player&#x27;s color.
** Definition. (&quot;Score&quot;) A player&#x27;s &quot;score&quot; is the number of intersections in their area in the final position.
* Rule 10. Winner: If one player has a higher score than the other, then that player wins. Otherwise, the game is a draw.

=== Comparative features of the basic rules ===
The essential features of these basic rules relative to other rulesets are summarized here. Each of the differences is discussed in greater detail in a later section of the article.

What variation exists among rulesets concerns primarily Rules 7A, 8, 9 and 10.

* The basic rules use area scoring, as in China and Taiwan, and as in the official rules of many Western countries. The main alternative is territory scoring. Though territory scoring is the system used in Japan and Korea, and is customarily used in the West, it is not possible to use territory scoring unless Rule 9 is replaced by a much more complex end-of-game rule. The goal of these basic rules is to present a simple system first. See below.
* The basic rules require the players to &quot;play the game out&quot; entirely. Virtually all rulesets used in practice provide some mechanism that allows players to begin scoring the game before the final position (the one used to score the game) has been reached. In some cases, this is merely a convenience intended to save time. In others, it may be an essential feature of the game. In any case, explaining these rules might obscure the nature of the game somewhat for a person unfamiliar with it. See below.
* The basic rules allow &quot;suicide&quot; (or &quot;self-capture&quot;). This is unusual outside of Taiwan and New Zealand. Inclusion of Optional Rule 7A is in line with practice elsewhere. See below.
* The basic rules apply the rule of &quot;positional superko&quot;. This, or a similar rule, is common in official Western rulesets, but not in East Asia. See below.
* The basic rules do not contain any special exceptions for territory in a &quot;seki&quot;. This agrees with most practice outside Japan and Korea. See below.
* The basic rules do not have a &quot;komi&quot;. This is now unusual in even-strength games, but was common practice until the mid-twentieth century. A &quot;komi&quot; is a number of points, usually five to eight, awarded to White in compensation for moving second. See below.
* The basic rules make no provision for the use of &quot;handicap stones&quot;. See below.
* The basic rules do not specify a &quot;counting system&quot;. A counting system is a conventional method for calculating the difference in score between the players (hence determining the winner). It may incorporate various devices, such as filling in one&#x27;s territory after the game, or shifting stones on the board into patterns, which allow quicker calculation of the difference in scores.

== Explanation of the basic rules ==
The object of the game of go is, in rough terms, to control more territory at the end of the game than one&#x27;s opponent does.

=== Elements of the game ===

==== Players ====
Rule 1. Go is a game between two players, called Black and White.

The choice of black or white is traditionally done by chance between players of even strength. The method of selection is called &quot;nigiri&quot;. One player (A) takes a handful of white stones; the other player (B) then places either one or two black stones on the board, indicating &quot;even&quot; or &quot;odd&quot;. Player A counts the number stones in their hand to determine whether there is an odd or even number. If the number of stones matches the other player&#x27;s selection of &quot;even&quot; or &quot;odd&quot;, Player B will play the black stones; if not, they will take the white stones.

When players are of different strengths, the weaker player takes black. Black may also pre-place several handicap stones before play begins, to compensate for the difference in strength—see below.

==== Board ====

Rule 2. Go is played on a plane grid of 19 horizontal and 19 vertical lines, called a &quot;board&quot;.

Definition: A point on the board where a horizontal line meets a vertical line is called an &quot;intersection&quot;. Two intersections are said to be &quot;adjacent&quot; if they are distinct and connected by a horizontal or vertical line with no other intersections between them.

The condition that the intersections be &quot;distinct&quot; is included to ensure that an intersection is not considered to be adjacent to itself.

Intersections are also called &quot;points&quot;.

There are 361 points on a regular board.

For simplicity, the rules will be illustrated mostly using boards.

Each of the following diagrams shows two points on a board:

In the first two diagrams, the points are adjacent; in the third and fourth, they are not.

Though boards are standard, go can be played on another size board. Particularly common sizes for quick games are and . (See also &quot;Board size&quot; below.)

Beginners might prefer to play on a board to start. The nature of the game remains similar enough to make this worthwhile, yet the games are shorter. For beginners, playing longer games is less important than playing a greater number of games.

==== Stones ====
Rule 3. Go is played with playing tokens known as &quot;stones&quot;. Each player has at their disposal an adequate supply of stones of their color.

Traditionally, Black is given 181 stones, and White, 180, to start the game. This is almost always sufficient, but if it turns out to be insufficient, extra stones will be used.

=== Positions ===
Rule 4. At any time in the game, each intersection on the board is in one and only one of the following three states: 1) empty; 2) occupied by a black stone; or 3) occupied by a white stone. A &quot;position&quot; consists of an indication of the state of each intersection.

Specifying a position involves only the current state of the board. It requires no indication of whose turn it is, nor any information relating to previous moves or states of the board. This definition of &quot;position&quot; is used in Rule 8 (&quot;positional superko&quot;).

The diagram shows a possible position:

Naturally, two stones are said to be &quot;adjacent&quot; if they occupy adjacent intersections. Similarly, a stone and an intersection are &quot;adjacent&quot; if the stone occupies an intersection adjacent to that intersection.

==== Connected stones and points ====
Definition. Two placed stones of the same color (or two empty intersections) are said to be connected if it is possible to draw a path from one to the other by passing only through adjacent intersections of the same state (empty, occupied by white, or occupied by black).

The concept of connected stones is used to describe (via the concept of &quot;liberties&quot;, defined below) the conditions in which stones are &quot;captured&quot; by a move. The concept of connected empty points is used only at the end of the game, to define a player&#x27;s &quot;score&quot;.

In the following position, the stones 1 and 7 are connected by the sequence of black stones 1, 2, ..., 7, in which each stone (other than 1) is adjacent to the stone before it. The empty points &quot;a&quot; and &quot;k&quot; are connected by the sequence of empty points &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, ..., &quot;k&quot;, in which each point (other than &quot;a&quot;) is adjacent to the one before it. In fact, it is easy to see in this position that all the black stones are connected to each other and that all the empty points are connected to each other.

The following position can be used as an example for when stones and empty points are connected.

In the diagram, stones and empty points are marked with the same number or letter, respectively, whenever they are connected to each other.

A &quot;chain&quot; is a set of one or more stones (necessarily of the same color) that are all connected to each other and that are not connected to any other stones. Although it is not necessary to define the word &quot;chain&quot; in order to state the rules, the concept is important for an understanding of the game.

For example, Black and White each have four chains in the diagram above. Black has one three-stone chain, one two-stone chain, and two one-stone chains. White has one four-stone chain and three one-stone chains.

It follows from the definitions that any stone on the board belongs to exactly one chain. Furthermore, saying that two distinct stones of the same color are connected is the same as saying that they belong to the same chain.

==== Liberties ====
In a given position, a &quot;liberty&quot; of a stone is an empty intersection adjacent to that stone or adjacent to a stone which is connected to that stone.

For example:

In the above position, the points &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, are the liberties of the black stone at 1.
* &quot;a&quot; is a liberty of Black 1 because it is adjacent to Black 1 itself.
* &quot;b&quot; is a liberty of Black 1 because it is adjacent to Black 2, which is connected to Black 1. Alternatively, &quot;b&quot; is adjacent to Black 3.
* &quot;c&quot; is a liberty of Black 1 because it is adjacent to Black 3, which is connected to Black 1.
* &quot;d&quot; is a liberty of Black 1 because it is adjacent to Black 4, which is connected to Black 1.
* &quot;e&quot; is a liberty of Black 1 because it is adjacent to Black 5, which is connected to Black 1. Alternatively, &quot;e&quot; is adjacent to Black 4.

The results are the same when determining the liberties of Black 2, or of any other stone belonging to the black chain.

In this position:
* The black stones marked 1 have the liberties &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; and &quot;h&quot;.
* The black stones marked 2 have the liberties &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot; and &quot;h&quot;. 
* The black stone marked 3 has the liberties &quot;g&quot; and &quot;h&quot;.
* The white stones marked 4 have the liberties &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;.
* The white stone marked 5 has the single liberty &quot;c&quot;.
* The white stone marked 6 has the liberties &quot;d&quot; and &quot;h&quot;.
* The white stone marked 7 has the liberties &quot;e&quot; and &quot;f&quot;.

Since the liberties of any two stones belonging to the same chain are identical, they are often called the &quot;liberties&quot; of that chain. For example, in the first diagram, the points &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; and &quot;e&quot; are the liberties of the lone black chain. In the second diagram, the liberties of the black chain in the lower right are &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; and &quot;h&quot;.

=== Play ===

==== Initial position ====
Rule 5. At the beginning of the game, the board is &quot;empty&quot;.

==== Alternation of turns ====
Rule 6. Black moves first. The players alternate thereafter.

What players may do when they move is the object of Rules 7 and 8.

==== Moving ====
Rule 7. On their turn, a player may either pass (by announcing &quot;pass&quot; and performing no action) or play. A play consists of the following steps (performed in the prescribed order):
* Step 1. Placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection (chosen subject to Rule 8 and, if it is in effect, to Optional Rule 7A).
* Step 2. Removing from the board any stones of their opponent&#x27;s color that have no liberties.
* Step 3. Removing from the board any stones of their own color that have no liberties.

A &quot;move&quot; is defined as a play or a pass. Thus, on each turn a player moves once.

A player may pass on any move. Usually, passing is beneficial only at the end of the game, when all territory has been claimed and further moves would be useless, or even harmful to a player&#x27;s position.

The following three sections discuss the successive steps of a play in greater detail, bearing in mind that, in view of Steps 2 and 3, all stones remaining on the board after any move must have at least one liberty.

==== Placing a stone on the board ====
Step 1 of a play. The player places a stone of their color on an empty intersection (chosen subject to Rule 8 and, if it is in effect, to Optional Rule 7A).

As indicated by the reference to Rules 8 and 7A (respectively the superko rule and prohibition of suicide, to be discussed later), there are some restrictions on the choice of point at which to play.

The following diagrams show a possible sequence of moves at the beginning of the game:
The following diagrams show how Black might play later in the same game:
Numbers are often used, as here, to indicate new moves in printed diagrams.

Once a stone has been played, it remains on the board in the same location, until the end of the game or until it is captured (removed from the board as part of Step 2 or Step 3 of a play).

==== Capture ====
Step 2 of a play. (After playing their stone) a player removes from the board any stones of their opponent&#x27;s color that have no liberties.

The stones removed from the board are said to have been &quot;captured&quot; by the player moving.

The diagrams below show the capture of a white stone by Black. To begin with, the white stone has a single liberty at &quot;a&quot;. By playing a stone at &quot;a&quot;, Black removes the last remaining liberty of the white stone. It is subsequently removed from the board.

At the edge of the board and especially in the corners, stones have fewer liberties to start with and are more easily captured.

Next, White captures a chain of four black stones by playing at &quot;a&quot;.

Black captures the white chain by playing at &quot;a&quot;. The black stone is not captured, because the white stones are removed first, providing it with two liberties.

Black captures the marked white chain at the edge of the board by playing at &quot;a&quot;. Then White captures the black stone in the corner by playing at &quot;b&quot;.

Here, White captures the three marked black chains by playing at &quot;a&quot;. 
==== Self-capture ====
Step 3 of a play. (After playing their stone and capturing any opposing stones) a player removes from the board any stones of their own color that have no liberties.

Optional Rule 7A. A play is illegal if one or more stones would be removed in Step 3 of that play.

The removal of one or more stones in Step 3 is called &quot;self-capture&quot;, or &quot;suicide&quot;. Most rulesets give effect to Optional Rule 7A, which prohibits it. This means that, in those rulesets, any play which under the basic rules would require a self-capture to be performed is illegal. For further information, see below.

First an example which, it is emphasized, does &quot;not&quot; involve self-capture. When Black plays at &quot;a&quot;, the capture of the marked white stones results in the black chain at the bottom right acquiring liberties. This move is legal (with the same result) whatever the rules.

The previous example shows that it is important that Step 2 of a play (capture) precedes Step 3 (self-capture). If the order were reversed, then self-capture would occur here.

It is not difficult to convince oneself that if a play results in the capture of opposing stones, self-capture does not occur.

Now some examples of plays in which self-capture occurs. These moves would be illegal under the optional rule prohibiting suicide.

In this example, if Black plays at &quot;a&quot;, then the stone played by them is removed immediately. This move has the same effect on the position as a pass, though it would not allow White to end the game by passing next (Rule 9). The move is in any event illegal by Rule 8. (This is the positional superko rule. This move might be legal under other versions of the superko rule. See below.)

In the next example, Black plays at &quot;a&quot;, resulting in the self-capture of the marked black stones.

==== Ko and Superko====

Rule 8. A play is illegal if it would have the effect (after all steps of the play have been completed) of creating a position that has occurred previously in the game.

Though a pass is a kind of &quot;move&quot;, it is not a &quot;play&quot;. Therefore, Rule 8 never bars a player from passing. One consequence of Rule 8 is the so-called &quot;ko&quot; rule:

Consequence (ko rule). One may not play in such a way as to recreate the board position following one&#x27;s previous move.

Whereas Rule 8 prohibits repetition of any previous position, the ko rule prohibits only &quot;immediate&quot; repetition.

The word &quot;ko&quot;, pronounced with a long &quot;o&quot;, is taken from Japanese (, ; usually written with katakana: ) and can mean both &quot;threat&quot; and &quot;aeon&quot; (from the Buddhist &quot;kalpa&quot;).

Rule 8 is known as the &quot;positional superko&quot; rule. The word &quot;positional&quot; is used to distinguish it from slightly different superko rules that are sometimes used. While the ko rule is observed in all forms of go, not all rulesets have a superko rule. The practical effects of the ko rule and the superko rule are similar; situations governed by the superko rule but not by the ko rule arise relatively infrequently. For further information, see below.
The superko rule is designed to ensure the game eventually comes to an end, by preventing indefinite repetition of the same positions. While its purpose is similar to that of the threefold repetition rule of Western chess, it differs from it significantly in nature; the superko rule bans moves that would cause repetition, whereas Western chess allows such moves as one method of forcing a draw. It is more similar to the prohibition of moves which would repeat the position in Chinese Chess (Xiangqi). The ko rule has important strategic consequences in go.

Some examples follow in which Rule 8 applies. These examples cover only the most important case, namely the ko rule.

The first diagram shows the board immediately after White has played at 1, and it is Black&#x27;s turn. Black captures the marked white stone by playing at &quot;a&quot;. If White responds by capturing at &quot;b&quot; with 3, the board position is identical to that immediately following White 1. White 3 is therefore prohibited by the ko rule.

Another example of ko follows. Here, Black 3 is illegal by the ko rule.

As noted in the section &quot;Self-capture&quot;, Rule 8 prohibits the suicide of a single stone. This is something of a triviality since such a move would not be strategically useful. Taking it for granted that no suicide of a single stone has occurred, the ko rule can be engaged in only one situation:

Restatement of the ko rule: One may not capture just one stone if that stone was played on the previous move and that move also captured just one stone.

Furthermore, this can occur only when one plays in the location at which one&#x27;s stone was captured in the previous move. The two points where consecutive captures might occur, but for the ko rule, are said to be &quot;in ko&quot;. For example, in the first two diagrams above, the points &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are in ko.

The next two examples involve capture and immediate recapture, but the ko rule is not engaged, because either the first or second capture takes more than one stone.

In the first diagram below, White must prevent Black from playing at &quot;a&quot;, and does this with 1 in the second diagram. Black can capture the three stones in White 1&#x27;s group by playing at &quot;b&quot;. Black does this with Black 2 in the third diagram. White may recapture Black 2 by playing at &quot;a&quot; again, because the resulting position, shown in the fourth diagram, has not occurred previously. It differs from the position after White 1 by the absence of the two marked white stones.

In the first diagram below, it is White&#x27;s turn. White must prevent Black from connecting the marked stones to the others by playing at &quot;a&quot;. The second diagram shows White&#x27;s move. White is threatening to capture the marked black stones by playing at &quot;b&quot;. In the third diagram, Black plays at &quot;b&quot; to prevent this, capturing White 1. However, by playing at &quot;a&quot; again, White can capture Black 2&#x27;s group. This is not barred by the ko rule because the resulting position, shown in the fourth diagram, differs from the one after White 1 by the absence of the marked black stones. This kind of capture is called a &quot;snapback&quot;.

=====Ko threats=====
The next example is typical of real games. It shows how the ko rule can sometimes be circumvented by first playing elsewhere on the board.

The first diagram below shows the position after Black 1. White can capture the marked black stone by playing at &quot;a&quot;. The second diagram shows the resulting position. Black cannot immediately recapture at &quot;b&quot; because of the ko rule. So Black instead plays 3 in the third diagram. For reasons that will become clear, Black 3 is called a &quot;ko threat&quot;.

At this point, White could choose to connect at &quot;b&quot;, as shown in the first diagram below. However, this would be strategically unsound, because Black 5 would guarantee that Black could eventually capture the white group altogether, no matter how White played.

Instead, White responds correctly to Black 3 with 4 in the first diagram below. Now, contrary to the situation after White 2, Black can legally play at &quot;b&quot;, because the resulting position, shown in the second diagram, has not occurred previously. It differs from the position after Black 1 because of the presence of Black 3 and White 4 on the board. Now White is prohibited from recapturing at &quot;a&quot; by the ko rule. White has no moves elsewhere on the board requiring an immediate reply from Black (ko threats), so White plays the less urgent move 6, capturing the black stone at 3, which could not have evaded capture even if White had waited. In the next diagram, Black connects at &quot;a&quot; before White has a chance to recapture. Both players pass and the game ends in this position.

=== End ===
Rule 9. The game ends when both players have passed consecutively. The &quot;final position&quot; (the position later used to score the game) is the position on the board at the time the players pass consecutively.

Since the position on the board at the time of the first two consecutive passes is the one used to score the game, Rule 9 can be said to require the players to &quot;play the game out&quot;.

Under Rule 9, players must for example capture enemy stones even when it may be obvious to both players that they cannot evade capture. Otherwise the stones are not considered to have been captured. Because Rule 9 differs significantly from the various systems for ending the game used in practice, a word must be said about them.

These systems, which are discussed more fully in below, generally allow the game to end as soon as it is clear to the players which stones would remain on the board if the game continued. The precise means of achieving this varies widely by ruleset, and in some cases has strategic implications. These systems often use passing in a way that is incompatible with Rule 9. For players, knowing the conventions surrounding the manner of ending the game in a particular ruleset can therefore have practical importance.

Under Chinese rules, and more generally under any using the area scoring system, a player who played the game out as if Rule 9 were in effect would not be committing any strategic errors by doing so. They would, however, likely be viewed as unsportsmanlike for prolonging the game unnecessarily. On the other hand, under a territory scoring system like that of the Japanese rules, playing the game out in this way would in most cases be a strategic mistake.

==== Territory ====
Definition. In the final position, an empty intersection is said to belong to a player&#x27;s territory if all stones adjacent to it or to an empty intersection connected to it are of that player&#x27;s color.

&quot;Note:&quot; Unless the entire board is empty, the second condition – that there be at least one stone of the kind required – is always satisfied and can be ignored.

A point can never belong to both players&#x27; territories.

On the other hand, it may well happen that an empty intersection belongs to neither player&#x27;s territory. In that case the point is said to be &quot;neutral territory&quot;. There are rarely any more than a handful of neutral points at the end of a game; in the majority of cases, there are none at all.

Japanese and Korean rules count some points as neutral where the basic rules, like Chinese rules, would not. For more on this, see .

In order to understand the definition of territory, it is instructive to apply it first to a position of a kind that might arise before the end of a game.
The point &quot;a&quot; is adjacent to a black stone. Therefore, &quot;a&quot; does not belong to White&#x27;s territory. However, &quot;a&quot; is connected to &quot;b&quot; (by the path shown in the diagram, among others), which is adjacent to a white stone. Therefore, &quot;a&quot; does not belong to Black&#x27;s territory either. In conclusion, &quot;a&quot; is neutral territory.

The point &quot;c&quot; is connected to &quot;d&quot;, which is adjacent to a white stone. But &quot;c&quot; is also connected to &quot;e&quot;, which is adjacent to a black stone. Therefore, &quot;c&quot; is neutral territory.

Similarly, the points &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are neutral territory.

On the other hand, &quot;h&quot; is adjacent only to black stones and is not connected to any other points. Therefore, &quot;h&quot; is black territory. For the same reason, &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are black territory, and &quot;k&quot; is white territory.

It is because there is so much territory left to be claimed that skilled players would not end the game in the previous position. The game might continue with White playing 1 in the next diagram. If the game ended in this new position, the marked intersections would become White&#x27;s territory, since they would no longer be connected to an empty intersection adjacent to a black stone. 
The game might end with the moves shown below. In the final position, the points marked &quot;a&quot; are black territory and the points marked &quot;b&quot; are white territory. The point marked &quot;c&quot; is the only neutral territory left.
In Japanese and Korean rules, the point in the lower right corner and the point marked &quot;a&quot; on the right side of the board would fall under the &quot;seki&quot; exception, in which they would be considered neutral territory. (See below.)

==== Area ====
Definition. In the final position, an intersection is said to belong to a player&#x27;s &quot;area&quot; if either: 1) it belongs to that player&#x27;s territory; or 2) it is occupied by a stone of that player&#x27;s color.

Consider once again the final position shown in the last diagram of the section &quot;Territory&quot;. The following diagram illustrates the area of each player in that position. Points in a player&#x27;s area are occupied by a stone of the corresponding color. The lone neutral point does not belong to either player&#x27;s area. 
==== Score ====
Definition. A player&#x27;s &quot;score&quot; is the number of intersections in their area in the final position.

For example, if a game ended as in the last diagram in the section &quot;Territory&quot;, the score would be: Black 44, White 36. The players&#x27; scores add to 80. The difference between this and the 81 intersections on a board is accounted for by the one point of neutral territory.
The scoring system described here is known as &quot;area scoring&quot;, and is the one used in the Chinese rules. Different scoring systems exist. These determine the same winner in most instances. See the &quot;Scoring systems&quot; section below.

==== Winner ====
Rule 10. If one player has a higher score than the other, then that player wins. Otherwise, the game is drawn.

In the previous example, Black wins by eight points.

Margin of victory does not matter; winning by one point is as good as winning by 100 points.

== Scoring systems ==
The most prominent difference between rulesets is the scoring method. There are two main scoring systems: territory scoring (the Japanese method) and area scoring (the Chinese method). A third system (stone scoring) is rarely used today but was used in the past and has historical and theoretical interest.

Care should be taken to distinguish between &quot;scoring&quot; systems and &quot;counting&quot; methods. Only two scoring systems are in wide use, but there are two ways of counting using &quot;area&quot; scoring.

=== Territory scoring ===
In territory scoring (including Japanese and Korean rules) a player&#x27;s score is determined by the number of empty locations that player has surrounded minus the number of stones their opponent has captured.

Furthermore, Japanese and Korean rules have special provisions in cases of &quot;seki&quot;, though this is not a necessary part of a territory scoring system. (See &quot;Seki&quot; below.)

Typically, counting is done by having each player place the prisoners they have taken into the opponent&#x27;s territory and rearranging the remaining territory into easy-to-count shapes.

Territory scoring was how very old Chinese Go games were scored; Chinese style gradually switched to area scoring during the Yuan dynasty and Ming dynasty of the 13th–16th centuries.

=== Area scoring ===
In area scoring (including Chinese rules), a player&#x27;s score is determined by the number of stones that player has on the board plus the empty area surrounded by that player&#x27;s stones.

There are several common ways in which to count the score (all these ways will always result in the same winner):

* The oldest counting method is as follows: At the end of the game, all white stones are removed from the board, and the players use black stones to fill the entirety of the black territory. Score is determined by counting the black stones. Since the board contains 361 intersections, black must have 181 or more stones to win. This method is still widely used in Mainland China.
* Around 1975, Taiwanese player and industrialist Ing Chang-ki invented a method of counting now known as Ing counting. Each player begins the game with exactly 180 stones (Ing also invented special stone containers that count each player&#x27;s stones). At the end, all stones are placed on the board. One vacant intersection will remain, appearing in the winner&#x27;s area; the number of stones of one color in the other color&#x27;s area will indicate the margin of victory.

=== Stone scoring ===
In stone scoring, a player&#x27;s score is the number of stones that player has on the board. Territory and prisoners are not counted. Play typically continues until both players have nearly filled their territories, leaving only the two eyes necessary to prevent capture. 

Stone scoring was likely the original method of Go scoring. It was described in a manuscript from Dunhuang from the Northern Zhou Dynasty (557–581), which is the oldest known Go manual. When Go reached Japan about 700 AD, the scoring system had been already simplified—stone scoring had been replaced by territory scoring using the so-called &quot;group tax&quot;. Stone scoring survived in some regions of China until the beginning of the 20th century.

===Group tax===
&quot;Group tax&quot; means deducting one point for every eye needed for a group to survive. It equals two points for living groups and one point for groups in seki with one eye. 

Group tax was a relic of stone scoring. Stone scoring includes it automatically since every (living) group needs two eyes and hence they cannot all be filled. Group tax was used with territory scoring both in Japan and in China. In Japan it was abandoned because it made territory scoring convoluted. In China during the Ming Dynasty a new scoring system was devised: area scoring with group tax. The new system was equivalent to stone scoring. The group tax is likely the reason why eyes in seki aren&#x27;t scored in the Japanese Rules.

=== Attempts at reconciling the scoring systems ===
If the game ends with both players having played the same number of stones, then the result will be identical in territory and area scoring: indeed, the difference of stones on the board will equal the difference of prisoners and hence the difference of score will be the same. 

AGA rules call for a player to give the opponent a stone (&quot;passing stone&quot;) when passing, and for White to play last (passing a third time if necessary). Because of passing stones, when one player passes and the second makes a move the difference of prisoners changes exactly the same way as the difference of stones on the board. 

White&#x27;s second pass is crucial when Black takes last dame. Since Black takes the last dame he made 1 move more than White. By taking the last dame Black gets 1 point under area scoring, but 0 points under territory scoring. To make territory and area scoring equal we need to give Black 1 additional point in territory scoring. Hence White&#x27;s second pass. Thus, in AGA rules, the result using a territory system is always the same as it would be using an area scoring system.

The results for stone and area scoring are identical if both sides have the same number of groups. Otherwise the results will differ by two points for each extra group. Some older rules used area scoring with a &quot;group tax&quot; of two points per group; this will give results identical to those with stone scoring.

=== Counting phase ===
Customarily, when players agree that there are no useful moves left (most often by passing in succession), they attempt to agree which groups are alive and which are dead. If disagreement arises, then under Chinese rules the players simply play on.

However, under Japanese rules, the game is already considered to have ended. The players attempt to ascertain which groups of stones would remain if both players played perfectly from that point on. (These groups are said to be &quot;alive&quot;.) In addition, this play is done under rules in which kos are treated differently from ordinary play. If the players reach an incorrect conclusion, then they both lose.

Unlike most other rulesets, the Japanese rules contain lengthy definitions of when groups are considered alive and when they are dead. In fact, these definitions do not cover every situation that may arise. Some difficult cases not entirely determined by the rules and existing precedent must be adjudicated by a go tribunal.

The need for the Japanese rules to address the definition of life and death follows from the fact that in the Japanese rules, scores are calculated by territory rather than by area. The rules cannot simply require a player to play on in order to prove that an opponent&#x27;s group is dead, since playing in their own territory to do this would reduce their score. Therefore, the game is divided into a phase of ordinary play, and a phase of determination of life and death (which according to the Japanese rules is not technically part of the game).

== Optional rules ==

=== Compensation ===
To allow players of different skills to compete fairly, handicaps and &quot;komi&quot; are used. These are considered a part of the game and, unlike in many other games, they do not distort the nature of the game. Players at all levels employ handicaps to make the game more balanced.

==== Komi ====

In an &quot;even&quot;, or non-handicap game, Black&#x27;s initial advantage of moving first can be offset by &quot;komi&quot; (compensation points): a fixed number of points, agreed before the game, added to White&#x27;s score at the end of the game. The correct value of komi (to properly compensate for Black&#x27;s advantage) is controversial, but common values are 5.5, 6.5, or 7.5; the fractional value avoids a tied game. In a handicap game, komi is usually set to 0.5 (i.e., White wins if the game is tied). A handicap game with a handicap of 1 starts like an even game, but White receives only 0.5 komi (i.e., a White player who is stronger by one rank is handicapped only by Black&#x27;s first-move advantage).

Before the 20th century, there was no komi system. When the great Shusaku was once asked how an important game came out, he said simply, &quot;I had Black&quot;, implying that victory was inevitable. As more people became aware of the significance of Black having the first move, komi was introduced. The amount of komi has been increased periodically based on analysis of game results indicating &gt;50% wins for Black; each time, after a period of adjustment Black has again begun winning &gt;50% of games. When it was introduced in Japanese Professional games, it was 4.5 points. However, Black still had a better chance to win, so komi was increased to 5.5 points in 1974. In 2002, the Japanese Go Association again increased the komi value to 6.5.

==== Handicap ====

Handicaps are given by allowing the weaker player to take Black and declaring White&#x27;s first few moves as mandatory &quot;pass&quot; moves. In practice, this means that Black&#x27;s first move is to place a certain number of stones (usually the number is equal to the difference in the players&#x27; ranks) on the board before allowing White to play. Traditionally, the hoshi (&quot;star points&quot;) – strategically important intersections marked with small dots—are used to place these handicap stones. On the board, there are nine star points: at the four 4–4 points in the corners, at the four 4–10 points along the sides, and one at the 10–10 point (the centre of the board, or &quot;tengen&quot; in Japanese). Smaller boards such as the and also have star points. The has 9 at the 4–4 points, 4–7 points, and the center. The board has only 5 points: the 3–3 points and the center.

When Black is only one rank weaker (also known as one &quot;stone&quot; weaker, due to the close relationship between ranks and the handicap system), Black is given the advantage of playing Black, perhaps without komi, but without any mandatory White passes. For rank differences from two through nine stones, the appropriate number of handicap stones are used. Beyond nine stones, the difference in strength between the players is usually considered great enough that the game is more a lesson where White teaches Black than a competition. Thus, nine stones is the nominal upper limit on handicap stones regardless of the difference in rank (although higher numbers of stones, up to 41 stones in some cases, may be given if the teacher wants a greater challenge).

=== Thinking times ===
== Variations ==
Go was already an ancient game before its rules were codified, and therefore, although the basic rules and strategy are universal, there are regional variations in some aspects of the rules.

=== Seki ===
For defining this notion, it is useful to introduce some additional terminology:

;Terminology
* An &quot;eye&quot; is a connected group of one (or more) empty intersections entirely surrounded by a chain or chains of stones of one color. 
* A chain of one color is &quot;independently alive&quot; if it is (or can be made to be) adjacent to two eyes.

These definitions are given only loosely, since a number of complications arise when attempts are made to formalize the notion of life and death.

A group of stones of one color is said to be &quot;alive by seki&quot; (or &quot;in seki&quot;) if it is not independently alive, yet cannot be captured by the opponent.
For example, in the diagram above, the black and white groups each have only one eye. Hence they are not independently alive. However, if either Black or White were to play at the circled point, the other side would then capture their group by playing in its eye. In this case both the black and white groups are alive by seki.

In the diagram above, the circled point is not surrounded by stones of a single color, and accordingly is not counted as territory for either side (irrespective of ruleset). In more complex cases, as here,
a vacant point may be surrounded by a group of a single color which is in seki. According to Japanese and Korean rules, such a point is nonetheless treated as neutral territory for scoring purposes. Generally, the Japanese and Korean rules only count a vacant point as territory for one color if it is surrounded by a group or groups of that color that are independently alive.

=== Repetition ===
The major division in rules to prevent repetition is between the simple ko rule and the super ko rule: the simple ko rule (typically part of the Japanese ruleset) prevents repetition of the &quot;last&quot; previous board position, while the superko rule (typically part of Chinese derived rulesets, including those of the AGA and the New Zealand Go Society) prevents repetition of &quot;any&quot; previous position. In both cases, the rule does not, however, prohibit passing.

The super ko rule is differentiated into situational super ko (SSK, in which the &quot;position&quot; that cannot be recreated includes knowledge of whose turn it is) and positional super ko (PSK, which ignores whose turn it is). Natural situational super ko (NSSK) is a variant in which what matters is not whose turn it is, but who created the position (i. e., who made the last move other than a pass.)

The Ing rules feature a complicated distinction between &quot;fighting&quot; and &quot;disturbing&quot; ko.

Situations other than ko which could lead to an endlessly repeating position are rare enough that many frequent players never encounter them; their treatment depends on what ruleset is being used. The simple ko rule generally requires the inclusion of additional rules to handle other undesirable repetitions (e.g. long cycles which can lead to &quot;no result&quot; where the game must be replayed).

The first position below is an example of a &quot;triple ko&quot;, taken, with minor changes, from Ikeda Toshio&#x27;s &quot;On the Rules of Go&quot;.

Without a superko rule, this position would lead to an endless cycle, and hence &quot;no result&quot;, a draw, or some other outcome determined by the rules.

For simplicity, when discussing this position using the superko rule, it is assumed that the last move placed a stone in a position unoccupied since the beginning of the game, and away from the ko. Under positional and situational super ko, Black captures the white group. This is also the case with natural situational super ko if it is Black&#x27;s turn. If it is White&#x27;s turn however, then NSSK exhibits odd behavior. White can get a seki by passing, but only at the cost of allowing Black unlimited moves away from the ko. If White insists on saving their group, the final position might look like the second diagram. On the other hand, with the first move (which should be a pass), White wins by two points in the third position using NSSK (assuming area scoring). Black&#x27;s best response, in terms of maximizing their score, is a pass.

=== Suicide ===
Currently, most major rulesets forbid playing such that a play results in that player&#x27;s own stones being removed from the board. Some rulesets (notably, New Zealand derived rules and Ing rules) allow suicide of more than one stone. Suicide of more than one stone rarely occurs in real games, but in certain circumstances, a suicidal move may threaten the opponent&#x27;s eye shape, yielding a ko threat.

=== Compensation ===
The major rulesets differ in how handicap stones are placed on the board: free placement (Chinese), where stones can be placed anywhere (as if the player&#x27;s turn repeated); and fixed placement (Japanese), where tradition dictates the stone placement (according to the handicap). Area scoring rules and territory scoring rules also differ in the compensation given for each handicap stone (since each handicap stone would count under area scoring). Komi (compensation for going second) also varies, ranging from several fixed values (commonly 5.5, 6.5, or 7.5) to various &quot;meta-games&quot; to determine a value (notably Auction Komi).

=== Board sizes ===
Most Go is played on a board, but and are also popular sizes. Historically other board sizes were commonly used (notably , a predecessor of the board in ancient China). Go is also sometimes played on various &quot;novelty&quot; sized boards as small as and larger than . All board sizes have an odd number of lines to ensure that there is a center point, possibly to make mirror Go a less attractive strategy. Generally all rules apply to all board sizes, with the exception of handicaps and compensation (whose placement and values vary according to board size).

=== Scoring ===
Historically in China a scoring system was used that penalized the player who had the greatest number of unconnected live groups of stones. On the basis that every group needs two eyes to be alive, and that the two eyes could not be filled in, two points were deducted from the score for each live group at the end of the game. This was known as the &quot;cutting penalty&quot; in Chinese, and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;group tax&quot; in English. This rule is not applied in modern Chinese scoring.

=== Issues ===
In general, there are three closely related issues which have to be addressed by each variation of the rules.

First, how to ensure that the game comes to an end. Players must be able to settle unsettled situations rather than going around in circles. And neither player should be able to drag the game out indefinitely either to avoid losing or to irritate the other player. Possible methods include: the super-ko rule, time control, or placing an upper bound on the number of moves. This is also affected by the scoring method used since territory scoring penalizes extended play after the boundaries of the territories have been settled.

Second, how to decide which player won the game; and whether draws (jigo) should be allowed. Possible terms to include in the score are: komi, prisoners captured during the game, stones in dead groups on the board at the end of the game, points of territory controlled by a player but not occupied by their stones, their living stones, the number of passes, and the number of disjoint living groups on the board.

Third, how to determine whether a group of stones is alive or dead at the end of the game, and whether protective plays are necessary; e.g., connecting a group which could be captured if all neutral territory were filled. If the players are unable to agree, some rules provide for arbitration using virtual attempts to capture the group. Others allow play to resume until the group is captured or clearly immortal.

== Rulesets ==
There are many official rulesets for playing Go. These vary in significant ways, such as the method used to count the final score, and in very small ways, such as whether the two kinds of &quot;bent four in the corner&quot; positions result in removal of the dead stones automatically at the end of the game or whether the position must be played out, and whether the players must start the game with a fixed number of stones or with an unbounded number.

Rulesets include Japanese, Chinese, Korean, the American Go Association, Ing, and New Zealand.

===Japanese rules===
These are rules used in Japan and, with some minor differences, in Korea. They are in wide use throughout the West, sometimes known as &quot;territory&quot; rules. The scoring is based on territory and captured stones. At the end of the game, prisoners are placed in the opponent&#x27;s territory and players rearrange the board so that territories are easy to count, leaving a visual image resembling the game, which some players find aesthetically pleasing. There is no superko (the triple ko leads to an undecided game). Suicide is always forbidden. Komi is 6.5.

Disagreements about whether certain groups are alive or dead, and about the counting of territory, are resolved in a notoriously complex manner (see above).

Japanese rules count vacant points in a seki as neutral, even if they are entirely surrounded by stones of a single color.

====World Amateur Go Championship Rules====
The rules of the World Amateur Go Championship are based on the Japanese rules, with some differences. These rules are sanctioned by the International Go Federation.

===Chinese rules===
This is the other major set of rules in widespread use, also known as &quot;area&quot; rules. At the end, one player (usually Black) fills in all of their captured territory, and the other (White) stones are removed from the board. Prisoners do not count. Black stones are then arranged in groups of ten—eighteen such groups, plus half the komi, plus at least one additional stone = victory for Black. So for example with a komi of 7.5 points, under Chinese rules Black needs at least 184.5 (but usually 185 since half points are not that common) stones on the board at the end to win. Komi is usually 7.5 points.

In the Chinese rules, there is no penalty for playing within one&#x27;s territory at the end of the game, for example to kill and remove dead enemy groups. Thus passing to signal that one believes that there are no more useful moves may be conceived as simply being a convenient device to accelerate the end of the game – assuming one is not mistaken. The result will always be the same as if the game had been played out entirely.

The fact that disagreements can be resolved by playing on means that Chinese-style rules can be implemented easily without the need for the rules to define what is meant by &quot;living&quot; and &quot;dead&quot; groups.

====World Mind Sports Games Rules====
The rules of the First World Mind Sports Games, held in Beijing in October 2008, are based on the Chinese rules, but are simpler, and represent a compromise with the Japanese and Korean rules.

 These rules are sanctioned by the International Go Federation.

These rules use area scoring, and have a komi of 6.5. Black has one further point deducted in the event that White was the first player to pass in the game. This last feature is a compromise with Japanese and Korean rules in that it is similar, in terms of its strategic consequences, to territory scoring. Unlike the Chinese rules, this rule will generally impose a penalty for an additional move at the end of the game within one&#x27;s territory. In particular, the result of the game may differ by up to a point from what it would have been had both players played it out.

The game normally ends after two consecutive passes, but in the event of disagreement about the score, play resumes in the original order. Once this resumption has occurred, then when two consecutive passes do eventually occur again, play stops and all stones left on the board are deemed alive. Thus after a single disagreement, the players are required to play the game out entirely. (By this point in the game, there is no longer any penalty for making &quot;useless&quot; plays within one&#x27;s territory to kill dead enemy groups, since the one-point advantage for passing first has already been attributed to one player or the other by the first set of consecutive passes.)

Suicide is forbidden in these rules. Unlike the Japanese rules, the WMSG rules apply superko (specifically, positional superko).

===AGA rules===
These are used by the American Go Association. Some special rules (like giving the opponent a prisoner when passing) are added, which make the area scoring and territory scoring equal.

The Federation Française de Go also uses AGA rules. The British Go Association also adopted the AGA rules, with some minor departures, in April 2008.

===Ing rules===
The scoring is basically the same as area scoring, but is done with a special technique involving &quot;Ing bowls&quot;. Both players must start with exactly 180 stones; the Ing Foundation makes special bowls that allow players to count their stones easily. Prisoners come back to the owner. After the game finishes, both players fill their empty territory with their stones. The one that gets rid of all of them is the winner. Black pays White eight points (komi) by allowing four white stones in Black&#x27;s territory to be placed at the beginning of the counting phase. As Black wins ties it is 7.5 in effect. The ko rule makes a distinction between &quot;fighting&quot; and &quot;disturbing&quot; ko. Multi-stone suicide is allowed. This ruleset was invented and promoted by Ing Chang-ki.

===New Zealand rules===
Area scoring is used. Multi-stone suicide is allowed. A stone may not be played such that the resulting board position repeats the whole board position as it was after any of that player&#x27;s previous moves. (Some people call this a &quot;superko&quot; rule.) Komi is 7 points (so draws with equal scores are possible).

===Differences===
In most cases the differences between the rulesets are negligible. The choice of ruleset rarely results in a difference in score of more than one point, and the strategy and tactics of the game are mostly unaffected by the ruleset used. Differences come from passing moves (if white and black did not pass the same number of times) and from seki scoring.

<text>The Smart Game Format (SGF) is a file format used for storing records of board games. Go is the game that is most commonly represented in this format and is the default. SGF was originally created under a different name by Anders Kierulf for his SmartGO program.

The main purposes of SGF are to store records of played games and to provide features for storing annotated and analyzed games (e.g. board markup, variations). It is a text-only, tree-based format.

Most Internet Go servers and Go software from 1990 support this format.

== About the format ==

An SGF file is composed of pairs of properties and property values, each of which describes a feature of the game. A partial list of properties appears below.
There is no strict checking of the contents of these tags, so it is possible to put any text into the result tag for example.

Variations are nested in brackets, and also usually assigned letters. The first branch (variation A) is the main branch. This notation stems from Newick format.

== Coordinate system for points and moves ==

The first letter designates the column (left to right), the second the row (top to bottom). The upper left part of the board is used for smaller boards, e.g. letters &quot;a&quot;-&quot;m&quot; for 13*13.

The author intentionally broke with the tradition of labeling moves (and points) with letters &quot;A&quot;-&quot;T&quot; (excluding &quot;i&quot;) and numbers 1-19. Two lower-case letters in the range &quot;a&quot;-&quot;s&quot; were used instead, for reasons of simplicity and compactness.

The upper left corner as origin of the board corresponds to the way most modern computers represent screen coordinates to simplify integration of text and graphics.

== Supported games ==
Games currently supported are Amazons, Ataxx, Backgammon, Blokus, Byte, Chase, Chess, DVONN, Exxit, Focus, Gess, GIPF, Go, Gobblet, Gomoku+Renju, Hex, Hive, Hnefatafl, Jungle, Kropki, Kuba, Lines of Action, Neutron, Nine men&#x27;s morris, Octi, Philosopher&#x27;s Football, Plateau, PÜNCT, Quadrature, Reversi (Othello), Sahara, Shogi, TAMSK, Tantrix, Trax, Tripples, Tumbling Down, TwixT, Xiangqi, YINSH and ZÈRTZ. Although not officially supported, the sgf format is also used for Meridians. The standard specifies additional game-specific properties for Go, Backgammon, Lines of Action, Hex, Amazons, Octi, Gess, and TwixT.

== Format Versions ==
The first version of SGF, FF[1], was conceived by Anders Kierulf in 1987. It is Appendix A in his Ph.D. thesis. FF[3] was written by Martin Müller in 1993. The current version of the SGF is FF[4] by Arno Hollosi, and is supported by most current SGF readers. FF[2] was never made public. The format has been published under the Open Content License. Current development status (2016) is &quot;not active&quot;.

FF[4] is outdated, but has not been replaced by something more recent. For a description of current usage and some recommendations, see.

== Limitations ==
The FF[4] standard has some problems that make it impossible, or at least unreasonable, to adopt it for large game collections. For some discussion, see.

The fact that there is no standard designation for many properties that one might wish to represent is not really a limitation. The system is extensible, one can invent new labels,
and of course that has happened already. After a while, the popular ones among the new labels become standard.

<text>Bluenose was a fishing and racing gaff rig schooner built in 1921 in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, Canada. A celebrated racing ship and fishing vessel, &quot;Bluenose&quot; under the command of Angus Walters, became a provincial icon for Nova Scotia and an important Canadian symbol in the 1930s, serving as a working vessel until she was wrecked in 1946. Nicknamed the &quot;Queen of the North Atlantic&quot;, she was later commemorated by the Bluenose one-design sloop (1946) and a replica, &quot;Bluenose II&quot; (1963). The name &quot;Bluenose&quot; originated as a nickname for Nova Scotians from as early as the late 18th century.

==Design and description==
&quot;Bluenose&quot; was designed by William James Roué, and intended for both fishing and racing. Built to compete with American schooners for speed, the design that Roué originally drafted in late 1920 had a waterline length of which was too long for the competition. Sent back to redesign the schooner, Roué produced a revised outline. The accepted revisal placed the inside ballast on top of the keel to ensure that it was as low as possible, improving the overall speed of the vessel. One further alteration to the revised design took place during construction. The bow was raised by to allow more room in the forecastle for the crew to eat and sleep. The alteration was approved of by Roué. The change increased the sheer in the vessel&#x27;s bow, giving the schooner a unique appearance.

The design, that was accepted and later built was a combination of the designs of both Nova Scotian and American shipbuilders had been constructing for the North Atlantic fishing fleet. The vessel was constructed of Nova Scotian pine, spruce, birch and oak and the masts were created from Douglas fir. &quot;Bluenose&quot; had a displacement of and was long overall and at the waterline. The vessel had a beam of and a draught of .

The schooner carried of sail. &quot;Bluenose&quot;″s mainmast reached above deck and the schooner&#x27;s foremast reached . Her mainboom was and the schooner&#x27;s foreboom was . The vessel had a crew of 20 and her hull was painted black. The vessel cost $35,000 to build.

== Career ==

&quot;Bluenose&quot; was constructed by Smith and Rhuland in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. The schooner&#x27;s keel was laid in 1920. The Governor General the Duke of Devonshire drove a golden spike into the timber during the keel-laying ceremony. She was launched on 26 March 1921, and christened by Audrey Smith, daughter of the shipbuilder Richard Smith. She was built to be a racing ship and fishing vessel, in response to the defeat of the Nova Scotian fishing schooner by the Gloucester, Massachusetts, fishing schooner in 1920, in a race sponsored by the &quot;Halifax Herald&quot; newspaper.

&quot;Bluenose&quot; was completed in April 1921 and performed her sea trials out of Lunenburg. On 15 April, the schooner departed to fish for the first time. &quot;Bluenose&quot;, being a Lunenburg schooner, used the dory trawl method. Lunenburg schooners carried eight dories, each manned by two members of the crew, called dorymen. From the dories, lines of strong twine up to long which had lines with hooks on the end spaced every were released, supported at either end by buoys which acted as markers. The dorymen would haul in the catch and then return to the ship. This was done up to four times a day. The fishing season stretched from April to September and schooners stayed up to eight weeks at a time or until their holds were full.

&quot;Bluenose&quot;″s captain and part owner for most of her fishing and racing career was Angus Walters. As Walters only had master&#x27;s papers for home waters, &quot;Bluenose&quot; in some international races was sometimes under the command of the deep sea Lunenburg captain George Myra until the schooner reached the racing port. The crew of &quot;Bluenose&quot; during her fishing career were mostly from Lunenburg but also included several Newfoundlanders. Crew were paid either by the size of the catch when they returned to port or some took a share in the vessel, known as a &quot;sixty-fourth&quot;.

===Racing===

After a season fishing on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland under the command of Angus Walters, &quot;Bluenose&quot; set out to take part in her first International Fisherman&#x27;s Cup. The International Fisherman&#x27;s Cup was awarded to the fastest fishing schooner that worked in the North Atlantic deepsea fishing industry. The fastest schooner had to win two out of three races in order to claim the trophy. The Canadian elimination race to determine who would represent Canada in the 1921 International Fishermen&#x27;s Trophy race off Halifax, Nova Scotia took place in early October. A best two-out-of-three competition, &quot;Bluenose&quot; won the first two races easily. &quot;Bluenose&quot; then defeated the American challenger &quot;Elsie&quot;, for the International Fishermen&#x27;s Trophy, returning it to Nova Scotia in October 1921. The following year, &quot;Bluenose&quot; defeated the American challenger &quot;Henry S. Ford&quot;, this time in American waters off Gloucester. &quot;Henry S. Ford&quot; had been constructed in 1921 based on a design intended to defeat &quot;Bluenose&quot;.

In 1923, &quot;Bluenose&quot; faced &quot;Columbia&quot;, another American yacht newly designed and constructed to defeat the Canadian schooner. The International Fishermen&#x27;s Trophy race was held off Halifax in 1923 and new rules were put in place preventing ships from passing marker buoys to landward. During the first race, the two schooners duelled inshore, the rigging of the vessels coming together. However, &quot;Bluenose&quot; won the first race. During the second race, &quot;Bluenose&quot; broke the new rule and was declared to have lost the race. Angus Walters protested the decision and demanded that no vessel be declared winner. The judging committee rejected his protest, which led Walters to remove &quot;Bluenose&quot; from the competition. The committee declared the competition a tie, and the two vessels shared the prize money and the title. The anger over the events led to an eight-year hiatus in the race.

In 1925, a group of Halifax businessmen ordered the construction of a schooner designed to defeat &quot;Bluenose&quot;. &quot;Haligonian&quot; was launched that year and a race was organized between the two ships. However, while returning to port with her catch, &quot;Haligonian&quot; ran aground in the Strait of Canso. The vessel required repairs and the race with &quot;Bluenose&quot; was cancelled. In 1926, a new race was organized, which &quot;Bluenose&quot; won easily. A new American schooner was designed and built in 1929–1930 to defeat &quot;Bluenose&quot;, . She was the last schooner of her type constructed for the fishing fleet in Gloucester. In 1930 off Gloucester, Massachusetts, &quot;Bluenose&quot; was defeated 2–0 in the inaugural Sir Thomas Lipton International Fishing Challenge Cup. The second race was controversial, as it was called off due to weather issues both times &quot;Bluenose&quot; took the lead. The following year, &quot;Gertrude L. Thebaud&quot; challenged &quot;Bluenose&quot; for the International Fisherman&#x27;s Trophy. &quot;Bluenose&quot; won handily, beating the American schooner in both races.

Fishing schooners became obsolete during the 1930s, displaced by motor schooners and trawlers. Salt cod, the main fishing industry in the North Atlantic had been surpassed by the fresh fish industry requiring faster vessels. In 1933, &quot;Bluenose&quot; was invited to the World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago, stopping in Toronto on her return voyage. In 1935, &quot;Bluenose&quot; sailed to Plymouth after being invited as part of the Silver Jubilee of King George V. During her visit, she took part in a race with schooner-yachts, specifically designed for racing. &quot;Bluenose&quot; came third. On her return trip to Nova Scotia, &quot;Bluenose&quot; encountered a strong gale that lasted for three days. Enough damage was done to the schooner that &quot;Bluenose&quot; was forced to return to Plymouth to effect repairs. She was made seaworthy enough to sail to Lunenburg where further repairs were done. In 1936, &quot;Bluenose&quot; had diesel engines installed and topmasts removed to allow the schooner to remain on the fishing grounds year-round.

In 1937, &quot;Bluenose&quot; was challenged once more by the American schooner &quot;Gertrude L. Thebaud&quot; in a best-of-five series of races for the International Fisherman&#x27;s Trophy. However, the financial difficulties of the owners of &quot;Bluenose&quot; almost prevented the race from going ahead. Furthermore, &quot;Bluenose&quot;″s sailing gear had been placed in storage after the schooner had been refitted with diesel engines. It was only with the intervention of American private interests that &quot;Bluenose&quot; was made ready for the race. Beginning on 9 October 1938, the first race, off Boston, was won by &quot;Gertrude L. Thebaud&quot;. &quot;Bluenose&quot; won the second which was sailed off Gloucester, but a protest over the ballast aboard &quot;Bluenose&quot; led to modifications to the schooner. She was found to be too long at the waterline for the competition. The alterations completed, &quot;Bluenose&quot; won the third race sailed off Gloucester, by an even greater margin than the second race. During the fourth race sailed off Boston, the topmast of &quot;Bluenose&quot; snapped, which contributed to &quot;Gertrude L. Thebaud&quot;″s win. The fifth race, sailed off Gloucester was won by &quot;Bluenose&quot;, retaining the trophy for the Nova Scotians. This was the last race of the fishing schooners of the North Atlantic.

===Coastal trade and fate===
During World War II, &quot;Bluenose&quot; remained at dock in Lunenburg. No longer profitable, the vessel was sold to the West Indies Trading Company in 1942. The vessel was once again stripped of masts and rigging and converted into a coastal freighter for work in the Caribbean Sea, carrying various cargoes between the islands. Laden with bananas, she struck a coral reef off Île à Vache, Haiti, on 28 January 1946. Wrecked beyond repair, with no loss of life, the schooner was abandoned on the reef. The vessel broke apart on the reef.

Various divers and film makers have claimed to have found the wreck of &quot;Bluenose&quot;, most recently in June 2005 by divers from the Caribbean Marine Institute searching for Henry Morgan&#x27;s ship . However, the large number of wrecks on the reef at Île à Vache and the scattered condition of the wreckage has made identification difficult.

==Fame and commemoration==

&quot;Bluenose&quot;, under full sail, is portrayed on the Bluenose postage stamp 50-cent issued by the Canadian government on 6 January 1929. &quot;Bluenose&quot; has been featured on a 1982 60-cent stamp that commemorated the International Philatelic Youth Exhibition. &quot;Bluenose&quot; is featured on a 1988 37-cent issue that celebrated &quot;Bluenose&quot; skipper Angus Walters. The &quot;Bluenose&quot; stamp is the MacGuffin of &quot;Tommy Tricker and the Stamp Traveller&quot;, a 1988 fantasy movie about young stamp collectors.

&quot;Bluenose&quot; also appears on the current Nova Scotia license plate. The fishing schooner on the Canadian dime, added in 1937 at the height of fame for &quot;Bluenose&quot;, was actually based on a composite image of &quot;Bluenose&quot; and two other schooners, but has for years been commonly known as &quot;Bluenose&quot;. In 2002, the government of Canada declared the depiction on the dime to be &quot;Bluenose&quot;.

&quot;Bluenose&quot; appears on a 2021 commemorative silver dollar issued by the Royal Canadian Mint, in honour of its centennial. The obverse of the coin depicts King George V, who was Canada&#x27;s head of state in 1921.

&quot;Bluenose&quot; and her captain, Angus Walters, were included into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in 1955, making her the first and only non-human inductee until 1960, when she was joined by Canadian hydroplane champion &quot;Miss Supertest III&quot;. That same year another honour was bestowed upon the sailing ship when a new Canadian National Railways passenger-vehicle ferry for the inaugural Yarmouth–Bar Harbor service was launched as MV &quot;Bluenose&quot;.

Canadian folk singer Stan Rogers wrote a song entitled &quot;Bluenose&quot; celebrating the ship. It appears on his albums &quot;Turnaround&quot; and &quot;Home in Halifax&quot; (live).

==Legacy==

===&quot;Bluenose II&quot;===

In 1963, a replica of &quot;Bluenose&quot; was built at Lunenburg using the original &quot;Bluenose&quot; plans and named . The replica was built by Smith and Rhuland, sponsored by the Oland Company. It was used as a marketing tool for the Oland Brewery Schooner Lager beer brand and as a pleasure yacht for the Oland family. &quot;Bluenose II&quot; was sold to the government of Nova Scotia in 1971 for the sum of $1 or 10 Canadian dimes. The replica schooner is used for tourism promotion as a &quot;sailing ambassador&quot;. In honour of her predecessor&#x27;s racing record, &quot;Bluenose II&quot; does not officially race. The replica has undergone several refits to extend her life. This vessel was decommissioned and dismantled in 2010, and an entirely new &quot;Bluenose&quot; (also named &quot;Bluenose II&quot;, since Transport Canada deemed it a &quot;reconstruction&quot;) was built as close to the original schooner deemed necessary and launched in Lunenburg in 2013. Various subcomponents for this &quot;Bluenose II&quot; project were supplied from notable firms including the ships keel at Snyder&#x27;s Shipyard in Dayspring, the ships backbone of laminated ribs at Covey Island Boatworks in Riverport and assembly of the vessel in Lunenburg. Much controversy has surrounded the vessel due to overspending on the &quot;refit&quot;. After further repairs ownership of the restored &quot;Bluenose II&quot; was returned to the province of Nova Scotia and she began a tour of Nova Scotia ports in the summer of 2015.

&quot;Bluenose II&quot; spends much of the year tied up at the Lunenburg Foundry wharf in its home port of Old Town Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, a UNESCO World Heritage site and origin of its predecessor. In the summer, the schooner tours the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, routinely stopping in ports across Nova Scotia, as well as Montreal, Quebec City and many ports of call in the United States, serving as a goodwill ambassador and promoting tourism in Nova Scotia. In the summer months, the schooner also offers onboard tours and harbour cruises.

In mid-2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, &quot;Bluenose II&quot; restricted its summer tour to Nova Scotia ports. The schooner&#x27;s 20-person crew formed a Bluenose quarantine bubble for training, maintenance and sailing, and its visits to ports aside from Lunenburg were restricted to at-anchors or sail-pasts.

===&quot;Bluenose IV&quot;===
In 2007, Joan Roué, the great-granddaughter of &quot;Bluenose&quot; designer William Roué, started raising funds to build a new &quot;Bluenose&quot;. She cited the need for a new ambassador for Nova Scotia and Canada, listing the particulars at a &quot;Bluenose IV&quot; website. The name &quot;Bluenose III&quot; is owned by the province of Nova Scotia, and Roué could not reach an agreement for its use on the new schooner; Roué and North Atlantic Enterprises proceeded anyway, under the name &quot;Bluenose IV&quot;. An agreement was reached with Snyder&#x27;s Shipyard to build the new replica when fundraising was completed. However, as of 2009, Roué had not succeeded in raising the required funds. The effort came to an end when the Province of Nova Scotia and the Canadian federal government constructed the new &quot;Bluenose II&quot; in 2013.

<doc id="102370" wikidata="Q961091" url="?curid=102370" title="Handicapping in Go">
<text>Within most systems and at most levels in the game of Go, a handicap is given to offset the strength difference between players of different ranks.

==Forms of handicaps==
In the game of Go, a handicap is given by means of stones and compensation points. In contrast to an even game, in which Black plays first, White plays the first move in a game with handicap (after Black&#x27;s handicap stones have been placed).

==Handicap stones==
The rank difference within a given amateur ranking system is one guide to how many handicap stones should be given to make the game a more equal contest. As a general rule, each rank represents the value of one stone. (In terms of points, one stone is considered to be 13-16 points, but this figure is not constant over levels: the more skillful a player, the greater the usefulness of each stone.)

For example, a 3 &quot;kyu&quot; player gives a 7 &quot;kyu&quot; player four handicap stones to allow for an interesting game with roughly equal challenge for both players. If traditional fixed placement of the handicap stones is used, nine stones is normally the maximum handicap. Larger handicaps are certainly possible; but with such a great difference in strength, Black may be simply bewildered, and not understand how many of White&#x27;s moves relate to his own.

The above rank relationship reliably applies for single-digit &quot;kyu&quot; (1-9k) and amateur &quot;dan&quot; (1-7d) ranks. The advantage of moving first is equivalent to only half a stone of handicap, as the opponent then has the initiative. Because White gets the next move after Black places the handicap stones, a nominal handicap of &quot;n&quot; stones is therefore in reality half a stone less than &quot;n&quot;.

Nowadays professional ranks are awarded by professional Go players&#x27; organizations; they are, unlike amateur ranks, not reliable as a measure of current playing strength, but rather an indication of achievements. Before the late 20th century, they were used as strength measurement, with a difference in skill of less than a third of a stone per rank.

==Small board handicaps==
Small boards are often used for novice players (double-digit kyu players) just learning to play Go, or for quick games. As the fewer moves made when playing on smaller boards gives White fewer chances to overcome the advantage conferred by the handicap, smaller handicaps are used on smaller Go boards (most commonly 13×13 and 9×9).

The per-rank handicap is therefore reduced, by a scaling factor. Various estimates have been given for the factor that applies to 13×13, in the range 2.5 up to 4; and on grounds both theoretical and experimental (small-board tournament play). The evidence is that 2.5 is more realistic than 4, for clock games. The corresponding factor for a 9×9 board is not easy to understand, and the change for each stone added is very large.

One theoretical approach is according to the distribution of the number of moves made in a game on a board of a given size relative to the number made on a 19×19 board. Using estimates that a 19×19 game will last about 250-300 moves, a 13×13 game about 95-120 moves, and a 9×9 game about 40-50 moves, a quadratic formula for the ratio of the mean number of plays may apply. Arguing that White catches up by means of Black&#x27;s &#x27;small errors&#x27;, so that White&#x27;s deficit drifts at a constant rate, it makes sense to take the ratio of game lengths as scaling factor.

Each full stone of handicap on a 13×13 board is in any case probably equivalent to about 2.5 to 3 ranks, and each full stone on a 9×9 board is equivalent to about 6 ranks. For example, if the appropriate handicap is 9 (i.e., 8.5) stones on a 19×19 board, the handicap between those two players is reduced to 4 (because 3.5 × 2.5 = 8.75) stones on a 13x13 board and 2 (1.5 × 6 = 9) stones on a 9×9 board. A 5 (i.e., 4.5) stone handicap on a 9×9 board is accordingly equivalent to a handicap of 27 or 28 stones on a 19×19 board.

These figures are not a consensus, but have wide support. They can be used to give rankings, by converting 13×13 handicaps back to rank difference.

==Handicap placement==

===Fixed placement===

There are 9 star points marked on a 19 x 19 board – in each corner on the (4,4) point, in the middle of each side on the fourth line, (4,10); and the very center of the board, (10,10). Traditionally handicaps are always placed on the star points, as follows:

As the stones are always at the same (4,4) points in the corners, Black always plays more (4,4) openings, and doesn&#x27;t gain experience playing the (3,4) openings, or others such as (3,3), (5,4), (5,3), etc., except on two and three stones.

===Free placement===
Recently, some have advocated free placement of handicap stones. Free placement means one can place handicap stones anywhere on the board without restriction. Here is the list of countries and servers that use free placement of handicap stones:
Although free placement is less common because many players are attached to tradition, especially in East Asian countries, it offers advantages which are not available with fixed placement.

====Advantages====
For weaker players:
* They can choose their opening strategies according to their own understanding of the game, and thus follow a consistent strategy.
* They can think for themselves and learn about different opening strategies through actual game experience.
* The mandatory handicap points stress influence rather than taking territory directly; some weaker players have a more territorial style.
* They can learn a much larger range of corner plays in actual competition against stronger opponents.
For stronger players:
* Many more variations with fewer repetitions mean the game is more refreshing, challenging, and interesting to the strong player. They may be more willing to play and teach the weaker player.

====Disadvantages====
With free placement, weaker players may not place their stones in respect to their comparable handicap to their opponent, thus eliminating the point of the handicap. The standard fixed handicap points allow for a good standard that allows novices to have the handicap they need since they are not experienced and may not be able to take advantage of the free placement of handicap stones. Therefore, free placement handicap may be best suited for more experienced players or those who want more flexibility and variety in play.

==Compensation points==
When the difference in strength is one rank, no handicap stone is given. Instead the stronger player takes White &quot;but without&quot; compensation points. The compensation points are called Komi in Japanese. It is a custom that Black plays first; White moves second. Playing first is regarded as a significant advantage in modern go, and to make the game fair to both players, this advantage must be compensated. It is regarded that playing first is equal to half a move or more ahead throughout the game.

Another common type of compensation used is the reverse compensation points, where the weaker player takes black, and is given both the first move and compensation points too. This is more advantageous than the above situation.

Compensation points are sometimes preferred to stones because the players would like to play or practice as if it is an even game. They would like to have the feel of an &quot;even game&quot;. White (the stronger player) must play better to overcome these disadvantages (points gained by playing first + compensation points).

===Fixed compensation point (komi) system===
When ranks are equal, Black gets advantages by playing first. The advantage of that first move is compensated by compensation points. However, there are still no absolute standards on the number of compensation points due to the difficulty of determining a fair value. 6.5 points are used in Japan and Korea. 7.5 points are used in China and USA (see AGA rules). The 0.5 points is used to prevent a draw.

=== Auction compensation point system===
As no one can be absolutely sure what the fair number of compensation points is, some advocate another system which is often used in some amateur matches and tournaments. There are no fixed compensation points. The decision is left to both players. They arrive at a value through negotiation and bidding. This is called auction compensation point system.

Examples of auction komi systems include:

* one player chooses how big komi will be given to White and the other player then chooses to play Black or White.
* the game is without komi; one player makes the first move of Black (not too weak and not too strong) and the other one then chooses to play Black or White. This is an application of the pie rule.
* the players do an &quot;auction&quot; by saying: &quot;I am willing to play Black against XXX komi&quot; and the player who wins the auction plays Black.

==Handicap strategy==

Handicap go is the traditional form of teaching given to go players. Fixed handicap placements are in effect a form of graded tutorials: if you cannot beat your teacher with a nine-stone handicap, some fundamental points are still to be learned.

The pedagogic value of fixed handicaps is an old debate for Western players. The &quot;theory&quot; of handicap go shares with much of the rest of the Japanese pedagogic go literature a less explicit approach, based on perception as much as analysis. Whether fixed handicap placement makes it easier or more difficult for the weaker player to learn these fundamental points is moot. The nature of these &quot;tutorial&quot; steps may certainly be misunderstood and contested by Western players new to the game. Handicaps are also unpopular with Chinese players, who have more of a tradition of equality at the board rather than deference to a teacher.

There are some book treatments of low-handicap go by strong professionals (Kobayashi Koichi and Kajiwara Takeo, in particular); and examples of pro-pro games to follow. With the traditional handicap placements, the only consistent strategy Black can follow depends on the use of influence. This is particularly true in the early stages of the middle-game fighting.

While Black often assumes that consolidating territory from the opening stages should be enough to win, that is not the case when the handicap stones are placed on the star points, where they are more effective in obtaining influence than territory. If Black does not understand and utilize the value of star-point handicap stones for attack, White will gradually build a more advantageous position, and steadily close the gap.

<text>Sopron (; , ) is a city in Hungary on the Austrian border, near Lake Neusiedl/Lake Fertő.

==History==

=== Ancient times-13th century ===

When the area that is today Western Hungary was a province of the Roman Empire, a city called &quot;Scarbantia&quot; stood here. The site of its forum is now the main square of Sopron.

During the Migration Period, Scarbantia was believed to be deserted. When Hungarians arrived in the area, the city was in ruins. From the 9th to the 11th centuries, Hungarians strengthened the old Roman city walls and built a castle. The city was named in Hungarian after a castle steward named &quot;Suprun&quot;. In 1153, it was mentioned as an important city.

In 1273, King Otakar II of Bohemia occupied the castle. Even though he took the children of Sopron&#x27;s nobility with him as hostages, the city opened its gates when the armies of King Ladislaus IV of Hungary arrived. Ladislaus rewarded Sopron by elevating it to the rank of free royal town.

===16th-19th centuries===
During the Ottoman occupation of Hungary, the Ottoman Turks ravaged the city in 1529, but did not occupy it. Many Hungarians fled from the occupied areas to Sopron, and the city&#x27;s importance grew.

While the Ottomans occupied most of Central Europe, the region north of Lake Balaton remained in the Kingdom of Hungary (1538–1867) (captaincy between Balaton and Drava).

In 1676, Sopron was destroyed by a fire. The modern city was born over the next few decades, when Baroque buildings were built to replace the destroyed medieval ones. Sopron became the seat of the comitatus Sopron.

The town was the seat of the &quot;Ödenburg&quot; comitat near 1850. After the compromise of 1867 and until 1918, the city (known with the dual bilingual name of 
&quot;Sopron - Ödenburg&quot;) was part of the Habsburg-ruled Kingdom of Hungary.

===20th century to present===

Following the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, ethnic Germans inhabited parts of four western Hungarian counties: Pozsony (Pressburg in German; Bratislava in Czech/Slovak), Vas (Eisenburg), Sopron (Ödenburg) and Moson (Wieselburg). The German-inhabited parts of those counties were initially awarded to Austria in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919). After local unrest and Italian diplomatic mediation in the Venice Protocol, Sopron&#x27;s status as part of Hungary (along with that of the surrounding eight villages) was decided by a controversial, local plebiscite held on 14 December 1921, with 65% voting for Hungary. Since then Sopron has been called &quot;Civitas Fidelissima&quot; (&quot;The Most Loyal City&quot;, ), and the anniversary of the plebiscite is a city holiday. However, the western parts of Vas, Sopron and Moson counties joined Austria and now form the Austrian federal state of Burgenland, and Pressburg/Pozsony was awarded to Czechoslovakia.

Sopron suffered greatly during World War II and was bombed several times. The Soviet Red Army captured the city on 1 April 1945. 

The city of Sopron and the village of Sopronbánfalva began to stretch towards each other at the beginning of the 20th century, they unified in 1950 and since the areas have merged. Sopron and the village of Balf unified in 1985.

On 19 August 1989 Sopron was the site of the Pan-European Picnic, a protest on the border between Austria and Hungary, which was used by over 600 citizens of East Germany to escape to the West. As the first successful crossing of the border, it helped pave the way for the mass flight of East German citizens that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989.

During the Socialist era, the government tried to turn Sopron into an industrial city, but much of the medieval town center remains, allowing the city to remain an attractive site for tourists.

Today, Sopron&#x27;s economy immensely benefits from the European Union. Having been a city close to nowhere, that is, to the Iron Curtain, Sopron now has re-established full trade relations to nearby Austria. Furthermore, after being suppressed during the Cold War, Sopron&#x27;s German-speaking culture and heritage are now recognized again. As a consequence, many of the city&#x27;s street-and traffic-signs are written in both Hungarian and German making it an officially bilingual city due to its proximity to the Austrian frontier. Visitors admire the large number of buildings in this city that reflect medieval architecture—rare in war-torn Hungary. Situated close to the Austrian border, Sopron receives many visitors from Vienna ( away), and from Bratislava, Slovakia ( away), as well as from the United States, Great Britain, The Netherlands, Japan, and Scandinavia, who visit to take advantage of the excellent low-cost dental services offered: Sopron boasts so many dental clinics—more than 300—that the city is known as the &quot;dental capital of the world.&quot;

==Wine production==

Sopron is a significant wine producing region, one of the few in Hungary to make both red and white wines. Grapes include Kékfrankos for red wine and Traminer (Gewürztraminer) for white wine. In climate it is similar to the neighbouring Burgenland wine region in Austria, and several winemakers make wine in both countries. Blue Frankish (= Kékfrankos, Blaufränkisch), Traminer, and Green Veltliner (= Zöld Veltelini, Grüner Veltliner) are well-known Sopron wines. Sopron&#x27;s Blue Frankish and Pinot Noir wines are particularly prized.

The group of ethnic German wine growers in the Sopron area in the Habsburg Monarchy were the so-called Ponzichter.

==Demographics==

In 1910, Sopron had 33,931 inhabitants (51% German, 44.3% Hungarian, 4.7% other). Religions: 64.1% Roman Catholic, 27.8% Lutheran, 6.6% Jewish, 1.2% Calvinist, 0.3% other. In 2001, the city had 56,125 inhabitants (92.8% Hungarian, 3.5% German, 3.7% other). Religions: 69% Roman Catholic, 7% Lutheran, 3% Calvinist, 8.1% Atheist, 11.9% no answer, 1% other.

==Architecture==

The architecture of the old section of town reflects its long history; walls and foundations from the Roman Empire are still common, together with a wealth of Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque structures, often artistically decorated, showing centuries of stability and prosperity.

There is an old synagogue and other remains from the town&#x27;s former Jewish community, which was expelled in the 16th century.

On Daloshegy, there is a 165-metre tall FM-/TV-broadcasting tower, nicknamed &quot;Rakéta&quot; (Hungarian for rocket).

<doc id="102381" wikidata="Q1937877" url="?curid=102381" title="Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr">
<text>Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr ( ; 9 July 1576 – 7 June 1618), was an English nobleman, for whom the bay, the river, and, consequently, a Native American people and U.S. state, all later called &quot;Delaware&quot;, were named. A member of the House of Lords, from the death of his father in 1602 until his own death in 1618, he served as the governor of Virginia from 1610 to 1611.

There have been two creations of Baron De La Warr, and West came from the second. He was the son of Thomas West, 2nd Baron De La Warr, of Wherwell Abbey in Hampshire, and Anne Knollys, daughter of Catherine Knollys; making him a great-grandson of Mary Boleyn, the sister of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII. He was born at Wherwell, Hampshire, England, and died at sea while travelling from England to Virginia. Counting from the original creation of the title, West would be the 12th Baron.

==Early life==
As the eldest son of the 2nd Baron De La Warr, Thomas West received his education at Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. He served in the English army under Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, and, in 1601, was charged with supporting Essex&#x27;s ill-fated insurrection against Queen Elizabeth I, but acquitted of those charges. He was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Lymington in 1597.

He succeeded his father as Baron De La Warr in 1602. It was said that he became a member of the Privy Council, but this has been disproved. In 1645 Dame Cicly petitioned the House of Lords to continue the pension that King James had granted her husband. There is only one supposedly contemporaneous portrait of Thomas, from 1605, but its authenticity has been questioned on the basis of the sitter&#x27;s attire and physical attributes.

==Governor of Virginia==

Lord De La Warr was the largest investor in the London Company, which received two charters to settle colonists in the New World, and furnished and sent several vessels to accomplish that aim. He was appointed governor-for-life and captain-general of the Virginia, to replace the governing council of the colony under the presidency of Captain John Smith. Subsequently, in November 1609, the Powhatans killed John Ratcliffe, the Jamestown Colony&#x27;s Council President, and attacked the colony in what became the First Anglo-Powhatan War. As part of England&#x27;s response, De La Warr recruited and equipped a contingent of 150 men and outfitted three ships at his own expense, and sailed from England in March 1610.

In 1610 captain Samuel Argall named Delaware Bay in honor of Lord De La Warr. Shortly afterwards Dutch settlers along the bay gave it a different name, but the name Delaware Bay was restored when the English took control of the area in 1665. Lord De La Warr contracted malaria or scurvy in 1611. He left the colony on a ship captained by Argall headed to the West Indies to recover but was blown off course by a storm, ending up in Faial Island, Azores. West returned to London, England in June, 1611. He requested a private audience from King James I to explain why he wasn&#x27;t governing in Virginia. He was summoned by the Virginia Company where he explained his health conditions (&quot;flux&quot;, cramps, gout, and scurvy) in detail and his diet of oranges and lemons in the Azores helped him recover.

Later that year, De La Warr published a book titled &quot;The Relation of the Right Honourable the Lord De-La-Warre, Lord Governour and Captaine Generall of the Colonie, planted in Virginea&quot;. The work was mockingly subtitled: &quot;A Short Relation made by the Lord De-La-Warre, to the Lords and others of the Councill of Virginea, touching his unexpected returne home, and afterwards delivered to the General Assembly of said Company...&quot;, written by Company employee Samuel Calvert.

In the autumn of 1616, Baron De La Warr and his wife Lady Cecilia introduced John Rolfe and his wife, Pocahontas, into English society. The visitors from Virginia were in London to raise funds for the Virginia Company of London and to encourage colonization of Virginia. De La Warr remained the nominal governor, and after receiving complaints from the colonists about Argall&#x27;s tyranny in governing them on his behalf, he set sail for Virginia again in 1618 aboard the &quot;Neptune&quot; to investigate those charges. He died at sea on 7 June.

==Burial==
It was thought for many years that Lord De La Warr had been buried in the Azores or at sea. By 2006, researchers had concluded that his body was brought to Jamestown for burial. In October 2017, archaeologists excavated remains from underneath one of the churches at Historic Jamestowne. While two sets of remains were De La Warr&#x27;s relatives, Sir Ferdinando Wainman and Captain William West, none were identified as Lord De La Warr.

==Personal life==
On 25 November 1596, De La Warr married Cecily Shirley (born c. 1579 died ), the daughter of Sir Thomas Shirley of Wiston, Sussex, and his wife Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas Kempe. They had the following known children:
*Cecilia (died February 1638), who married firstly Sir Francis Bindlosse and secondly after 1629 John Byron, 1st Baron Byron. She was buried at Hucknall-Torkard in Nottinghamshire.
*Lucy, who married Sir Robert Byron (d. after 1643), Governor of Liverpool and a Colonel in the service of the Royalist Infantry Forces who fought in the English Civil War.
*Robert, who married Elizabeth Coch.
* Henry (1603–1628), who succeeded his father as the 4th Baron De La Warr, married Isabella, daughter of Sir Thomas Edmondes, in March 1625. He died at the age of 24 and was succeeded by his son Charles West, 5th Baron De La Warr.

Lord De La Warr&#x27;s brother, John West, later became governor and married Anne Percy, daughter of George Percy.
