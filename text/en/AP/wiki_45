<text>Worcester ( , ) is the second-most populous city in the U.S. state of Massachusetts and the 114th most populous city in the United States. Named after Worcester, England, the city had 206,518 people at the 2020 census, also making it the second-most populous city in New England, after Boston, Massachusetts. Worcester is about west of Boston, east of Springfield, Massachusetts, and north-northwest of Providence, Rhode Island. Because it is near the geographic center of Massachusetts, Worcester is known as the &quot;Heart of the Commonwealth&quot;; a heart is the official symbol of the city. Worcester is the historical seat of Worcester County.

Worcester developed as an industrial city in the 19th century because the Blackstone Canal and railways facilitated the import of raw materials and the export of such finished goods as machines, textiles, and wire. Many European immigrants made up the city&#x27;s growing population. After World War II, manufacturing there waned; economic and population decline was not reversed until the 1990s, when higher education, medicine, biotechnology, and new immigrants started making their mark. The population has grown by 28% since 1980, reaching its all-time high in the 2020 census and effecting urban renewal.

Modern Worcester is known for its diversity and large immigrant population, with significant communities of Vietnamese, Brazilians, Albanians, Puerto Ricans, Ghanaians, Dominicans, Irish, English, Italians, Greeks, and others. Twenty-two percent of Worcester&#x27;s population was born outside the United States. A center of higher education, it is home to eight colleges and universities, including the College of the Holy Cross, Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), Clark University, and Worcester State University. Worcester has many 19th-century triple-decker houses, Victorian-era mills and related buildings, and lunch-car diners, such as Miss Worcester.

Worcester is the principal city of Central Massachusetts, and is a regional hub of government, industry, and transportation. Since the 1970s, and especially since the construction of Route 146 and interstates 90, 495, 190, 290, and 395, both Worcester and its surrounding towns have become more integrated with Boston&#x27;s suburbs. The Worcester region now marks the western periphery of the Boston–Worcester–Providence (MA–RI–NH) U.S. Census Combined Statistical Area (CSA), or Greater Boston.

==History==
===Colonial era===
The area was inhabited by members of the Nipmuc tribe at the time of European contact. The native people called the region &quot;Quinsigamond&quot; and built a settlement on Pakachoag Hill in Auburn.

In 1673, English settlers John Eliot and Daniel Gookin led an expedition to Quinsigamond to establish a new Christian Indian praying town and identify a new location for an English settlement. On July 13, 1674, Gookin obtained a deed to eight square miles of land in Quinsigamond from the Nipmuc people and English traders and settlers began to inhabit the region.

In 1675, King Philip&#x27;s War broke out throughout New England with the Nipmuc Indians coming to the aid of Indian leader King Philip. The English settlers completely abandoned the Quinsigamond area and the empty buildings were burned by the Indian forces. The town was again abandoned during Queen Anne&#x27;s War in 1702.

Finally, in 1713, Worcester was permanently resettled for a third and final time by Jonas Rice. Named after the city of Worcester, England, the town was incorporated on June 14, 1722.

On April 2, 1731, Worcester was chosen as the county seat of the newly founded Worcester County government. Between 1755 and 1758, future U.S. president John Adams worked as a schoolteacher and studied law in Worcester.

Worcester also had a role in the start of the American Revolution, with an event that is oft-forgotten. On September 6, 1774, 4,622 militiamen from 37 towns in Worcester County assembled and marched on Main Street, Worcester; they sought to shut down the Crown&#x27;s court before it could sit for a new session. The event was dubbed the Worcester Revolution, or the Worcester Revolt. Having seized the courthouse, the militiamen waited for the 25 appointees from the Crown to arrive, where they were denied entry and later forced to disavow their appointments by King George III. Bloodshed and violence was avoided, with not a shot fired. British authority had been demonstrably overthrown in the American colonies for the first time.

===Growth and industry===
In the 1770s, Worcester became a center of American revolutionary activity. The Worcester Revolt on September 6, 1774, was an early successful attempt to throw off British rule. British General Thomas Gage was given information of patriot ammunition stockpiled in Worcester in 1775. That same year, &quot;Massachusetts Spy&quot; publisher Isaiah Thomas moved his radical newspaper out of British occupied Boston to Worcester. Thomas would continuously publish his paper throughout the American Revolutionary War. On July 14, 1776, Thomas performed the first public reading in Massachusetts of the Declaration of Independence from the porch of the Old South Church, where the 19th-century Worcester City Hall stands today. He would later go on to form the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester in 1812.

During the turn of the 19th century, Worcester&#x27;s economy moved into manufacturing. Factories producing textiles, shoes and clothing opened along the nearby Blackstone River.

However, the manufacturing industry in Worcester would not begin to thrive until the opening of the Blackstone Canal in 1828 and the opening of the Worcester and Boston Railroad in 1835. The city transformed into a transportation hub and the manufacturing industry flourished.

Worcester was officially chartered as a city on February 29, 1848. The city&#x27;s industries soon attracted immigrants of primarily Irish, Scottish, French, German, and Swedish descent in the mid-19th century and later many immigrants of Lithuanian, Polish, Italian, Greek, Turkish, Armenian, Syrian, and Lebanese descent. Immigrants moved into new three-decker houses (which originated in Worcester) lining hundreds of Worcester&#x27;s expanding streets and neighborhoods.

In 1831, Ichabod Washburn opened the Washburn &amp; Moen Company. The company would become the largest wire manufacturing in the country and Washburn became one of the leading industrial and philanthropic figures in the city.

Worcester would become a center of machinery, wire products and power looms and boasted large manufacturers, including Washburn &amp; Moen, Wyman-Gordon Company, American Steel &amp; Wire, Morgan Construction and the Norton Company. In 1908, the Royal Worcester Corset Company was the largest employer of women in the United States.

Worcester would also claim many inventions and firsts. New England Candlepin bowling was invented in Worcester by Justin White in 1879. Esther Howland began the first line of Valentine&#x27;s Day cards from her Worcester home in 1847. Loring Coes invented the first monkey wrench and Russell Hawes created the first envelope folding machine. On June 12, 1880, Lee Richmond pitched the first perfect game in Major league baseball history for the Worcester Ruby Legs at the Worcester Agricultural Fairgrounds. The first three-decker homes were built by Francis Gallagher (1830–1911) in Worcester.

===Urban changes and recovery===
After World War II, Worcester began to fall into decline as the city lost its manufacturing base to cheaper alternatives across the country and overseas. Worcester felt the national trends of movement away from historic urban centers. The city&#x27;s population dropped over 20% from 1950 to 1980. In the mid-20th century, large urban renewal projects were undertaken to try to reverse the city&#x27;s decline. A huge area of downtown Worcester was demolished for new office towers and the Worcester Center Galleria shopping mall. After only 30 years, the Galleria would lose most of its major tenants and its appeal to more suburban shopping malls around Worcester County.

On June 9, 1953, an F4 tornado touched down in Petersham, northwest of Worcester. The tornado tore through of Worcester County including a large area of the city of Worcester. The tornado left massive destruction and killed 94 people. The Worcester tornado would be the deadliest tornado ever to hit Massachusetts. Debris from the tornado landed as far away as Dedham. In the 1960s, Interstate 290 was built right through the center of Worcester, permanently dividing the city. In 1963, Worcester native Harvey Ball introduced the iconic yellow smiley face to American culture.

In the late 20th century, Worcester&#x27;s economy began to recover as the city expanded into biotechnology and healthcare fields. The UMass Medical School has become a leader in biomedical research and the Massachusetts Biotechnology Research Park has become a center of medical research and development. Worcester hospitals Saint Vincent Hospital and UMass Memorial Health Care have become two of the largest employers in the city. Worcester&#x27;s many colleges, including the Quinsigamond Community College, College of the Holy Cross, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Clark University, UMass Medical School, Assumption University, Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, and Worcester State University, attract many students to the area and help drive the new economy.

On December 3, 1999, a homeless couple accidentally started a five-alarm fire at the Worcester Cold Storage &amp; Warehouse Company. The fire took the lives of six firemen and drew national attention as one of the worst firefighting tragedies of the late 20th century. President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and other local and national dignitaries attended the funeral service and memorial program in Worcester.

===Since 1997===
In recent decades, a renewed interest in the city&#x27;s downtown has brought new investment and construction to Worcester. A Convention Center was built along the DCU Center arena in downtown Worcester in 1997. In 2000, Worcester&#x27;s Union Station reopened after 25 years of neglect and a $32 million renovation. Hanover Insurance helped fund a multimillion-dollar renovation to the old Franklin Square Theater into the Hanover Theatre for the Performing Arts. In 2000, the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences built a new campus in downtown Worcester. In 2007, WPI opened the first facility in their new Gateway Park center in Lincoln Square. In 2004, Berkeley Investments proposed demolishing the old Worcester Center Galleria for a new mixed-used development called City Square. The ambitious project looked to reconnect old street patterns while creating a new retail, commercial and living destination in the city. After struggling to secure finances for a number of years, Hanover Insurance took over the project and demolition began on September 13, 2010. Unum Insurance and the Saint Vincent Hospital leased into the project and both facilities opened in 2013. The new Front Street opened on December 31, 2012.

Worcester has become home to many refugees in recent years. The city has successfully resettled over 2,000 refugees coming from over 24 countries. Today, most of these refugees come from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Somalia, Bhutan, Syria, Ukraine and Afghanistan.

In 2025, Worcester City Council passed a resolution to become a sanctuary city for the transgender community.

==Geography==

Worcester has a total area of : of land and , comprising roughly 2.59%, of water. Worcester is bordered by the towns of Auburn, Grafton, Holden, Leicester, Millbury, Paxton, Shrewsbury, and West Boylston.

Worcester is known as the &quot;Heart of the Commonwealth&quot; because of its proximity to the center of Massachusetts. The city is about west of Boston, east of Springfield, and northwest of Providence, Rhode Island.

The Blackstone River forms in the center of Worcester by the confluence of the Middle River and Mill Brook. The river courses underground through the center of the city, and emerges at the foot of College Hill. It then flows south through Quinsigamond Village and into Millbury. Worcester is the beginning of the Blackstone Valley that frames the river. The Blackstone Canal was once an important waterway connecting Worcester to Providence and the Eastern Seaboard, but the canal fell into disuse at the end of the 19th century and was mostly covered up. In recent years, local organizations, including the Canal District Business Association, have proposed restoring the canal and creating a Blackstone Valley National Park.

Worcester is one of many cities claimed, like Rome, to be found on seven hills: Airport Hill, Bancroft Hill, Belmont Hill (Bell Hill), Grafton Hill, Green Hill, Pakachoag Hill and Vernon Hill. However, Worcester has more than seven hills, examples of which include Indian Hill, Newton Hill, Poet&#x27;s Hill, and Wigwam Hill.

Worcester has many ponds and two prominent lakes: Indian Lake and Lake Quinsigamond. Lake Quinsigamond (also known as Long Pond) stretches across the Worcester and Shrewsbury border and is a very popular competitive rowing and boating destination.

===Climate===
Worcester&#x27;s humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) is typical of New England. The weather changes rapidly owing to the confluence of warm, humid air from the southwest; cool, dry air from the north; and the moderating influence of the Atlantic Ocean to the east. Summers are typically hot and humid, while winters are cold, windy, and snowy. Snow typically falls from the second half of November into early April, with occasional falls in October; May snow is much rarer. The USDA classifies the city as straddling hardiness zones 5b and 6a.

The hottest month is July, with a 24-hour average of , while the coldest is January, at . There are an average of only 3.5 days of highs at or above and 4.1 nights of lows at or below per year, and periods of either extremes are rarely sustained. The all-time record high temperature is , recorded on July 4, 1911, the only or greater temperature to date. The all-time record low temperature is , recorded on February 16, 1943. The lowest daily maximum temperature on record is on January 8, 1968, while the highest daily minimum is on July 4, 1911.

Worcester is known for being particularly snowy in the cold months, sometimes even experiencing intense autumn blizzards. The city averages of precipitation a year, as well as an average of of snowfall a season, receiving far more snow than coastal locations less than away. Massachusetts&#x27; geographic location, jutting out into the North Atlantic, as well as Worcester&#x27;s elevation relative to the surrounding terrain, makes the city very prone to Nor&#x27;easter weather systems that can dump heavy snow on the region. Extreme winters have brought up to of snowfall, as happened in 2005. In late January 2015, a blizzard traversed over the city as it shed almost of snow. This was the highest single-day snowfall total for anywhere in Massachusetts since data collection began in 1892.

While rare, the city has had its share of extreme weather. On September 21, 1938, the city was hit by the brutal New England Hurricane of 1938. Fifteen years later, Worcester was hit by a tornado that killed 94 people. The deadliest tornado in New England history, it damaged a large part of the city and surrounding towns. It struck Assumption Preparatory School, now the site of Quinsigamond Community College.

==Economy==
By the mid-19th century, Worcester was one of New England&#x27;s largest manufacturing centers. The city&#x27;s large industries specialized in machinery, wire production, and power looms. Although manufacturing has declined, the city still maintains large manufactures, like Norton Abrasives, which was bought by Saint-Gobain in 1990, Morgan Construction Company, since bought by Siemens and then bought by Japanese company PriMetals Technologies, and the David Clark Company. The David Clark Company pioneered aeronautical equipment including anti-gravity suits and noise attenuating headsets.

Services, particularly education and healthcare, make up a large portion of the city&#x27;s economy. Worcester&#x27;s many colleges and universities make higher education a considerable presence in the city&#x27;s economy.
Hanover Insurance was founded in 1852 and retains its headquarters in Worcester. Unum Insurance and Fallon Community Health Plan have offices in the city. Polar Beverages is the largest independent soft-drink bottler in the country and is in Worcester.
Worcester is home to the largest concentration of digital gaming students in the United States. The Memorial Auditorium, built as a tribute to World War I veterans of Worcester, is undergoing a renovation and may cater to these Digital Students as a future multimedia and digital center, in conjunction with the twelve Worcester colleges and universities.

As one of the top ten emerging hubs for tech startups, the city&#x27;s biotechnology and technology industries have helped spur major expansions at both the University of Massachusetts Medical School and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The Massachusetts Biotechnology Research Park hosts many innovative companies including Advanced Cell Technology and AbbVie. The Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology in nearby Shrewsbury developed the oral contraceptive pill in 1951.

Downtown Worcester used to boast major Boston retailers Filene&#x27;s and Jordan Marsh as well Worcester&#x27;s own department stores Barnard&#x27;s and Denholm &amp; McKay. Over time most retailers moved away from downtown and into the suburban Auburn Mall and Greendale Mall in North Worcester.

==Arts and culture==

Much of Worcester&#x27;s culture is synonymous with broader New England culture. The city&#x27;s name is notoriously mispronounced by people unfamiliar with the city. As with the city in England, the first syllable of &quot;cester&quot; (&quot;castra&quot;) is left entirely unvoiced. Combined with a traditionally non-rhotic Eastern New England English accent, the name can be transcribed as &quot;WOOS-tuh&quot; or &quot;WISS-tuh&quot; (the first syllable possibly having a near-close central unrounded vowel).

Worcester has many traditionally ethnic neighborhoods, including Quinsigamond Village (Swedish), Shrewsbury Street (Italian), Kelley Square (Irish and Polish), Vernon Hill (Lithuanian), Union Hill (Jewish), and Main South (Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Vietnamese).

Shrewsbury Street is Worcester&#x27;s traditional &quot;Little Italy&quot; neighborhood and today boasts many of the city&#x27;s most popular restaurants and nightlife. The Canal District was once an old Eastern European neighborhood, but has been redeveloped into a very popular bar, restaurant and club scene.
Worcester is also famously the former home of the Worcester Lunch Car Company. The company began in 1906 and built many famous lunch car diners in New England. Worcester is home to many classic lunch car diners, including Boulevard Diner, Corner Lunch, Chadwick Square Diner, and Miss Worcester Diner.

There are also many dedicated community organizations and art associations in the city. &quot;stART on the Street&quot; is an annual festival promoting local art. The Worcester Music Festival and New England Metal and Hardcore Festival are also held annually in Worcester. The Worcester County St. Patrick&#x27;s Parade runs through Worcester and is one of the largest St. Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations in the state. The city also held the second oldest First Night celebration in the country each New Year&#x27;s Eve until 2017. Since 1916, Worcester has also been the home of the Worcester Kiltie Pipe Band, one of the oldest pipe bands in the United States.

Worcester is also the state&#x27;s largest center for the arts outside of Boston. Mechanics Hall, built in 1857, is one of the oldest concert halls in the country and is renowned for its pure acoustics. In 2008 the old Poli Palace Theatre reopened as the Hanover Theatre for the Performing Arts. The theatre brings many Broadway shows and nationally recognized performers to the city. Tuckerman Hall, designed by one of the country&#x27;s earliest woman architects, Josephine Wright Chapman, is home to the Massachusetts Symphony Orchestra.

Worcester is also home to the Worcester Youth Orchestras. Founded in 1947 by Harry Levenson, it is the 3rd oldest youth orchestra in the country and regularly performs at Mechanics Hall.

Mechanics Hall is also home to the Worcester Symphony Orchestra formerly known as the New England Symphony Orchestra. Founded in 1974 the Worcester Symphony Orchestra performs classical works regularly at Mechanics Hall in downtown Worcester.
The nickname &quot;Wormtown&quot; is synonymous with the city&#x27;s once large underground rock music scene. The nickname has now become used to refer to the city itself.

Due to its location in Central Massachusetts, Worcester is known as the &quot;Heart of the Commonwealth&quot;; a heart is the official symbol of the city. However, the heart symbol may also have its provenance in lore that the Valentine&#x27;s Day card, although not invented in the city, was first mass-produced and popularized by Worcester resident Esther Howland. Similarly, the invention of the classic yellow &quot;smiley face&quot; design by Worcester native Harvey Ball has gained it an iconic status in the city. This design is now commonly seen in art and merchandise relating to Worcester, including murals, t-shirts and stickers.

===Sites of interest===

The first Catholics came to Worcester in 1826. They were chiefly Irish immigrants brought to America by the builders of the Blackstone canal. As time went on and the number of Catholics increased, the community petitioned Bishop Fenwick to send them a priest. In response to this appeal, the bishop appointed the Reverend James Fitton to visit the Catholics of Worcester in 1834. A Catholic Mass was first offered in the city in an old stone building on Front Street. The foundation of Christ&#x27;s Church, the first Catholic church in Worcester (now St. John&#x27;s), was laid on July 6, 1834.

Worcester is governed by a council–manager government, with a popularly elected mayor. A city council acts as the legislative body, and the council-appointed manager handles the traditional day-to-day chief executive functions.

City councilors can run as either a representative of a city district or as an at-large candidate. The winning at-large candidate who receives the greatest number of votes for mayor becomes the mayor (at-large councilor candidates must ask to be removed from the ballot for mayor if they do not want to be listed on the mayoral ballot). As a result, voters must vote for their mayoral candidate twice, once as an at-large councilor, and once as the mayor. The mayor has no more authority than other city councilors, but is the ceremonial head of the city and chair of the city council and school committee. Currently, there are 11 councilors: 6 at-large and 5 district.

Worcester&#x27;s first charter, which went into effect in 1848, established a Mayor/Bicameral form of government. Together, the two chambers—the 11-member Board of Aldermen and the 30-member Common Council—were vested with complete legislative powers. The mayor handled all administrative departments, though appointments to those departments had to be approved by the two-chamber City Council.

Seeking to replace the 1848 charter, Worcester voters in November 1947 approved a change to Plan E municipal government. In effect from January 1949 until November 1985, this charter (as outlined in chapter 43 of the Massachusetts General Laws) established City Council/City Manager government. This type of governance, with modifications, has survived to the present day.

Initially, Plan E government in Worcester was organized as a 9-member council (all at-large), a ceremonial mayor elected from the council by the councilors, and a council-appointed city manager. The manager oversees the daily administration of the city, makes all appointments to city offices, and can be removed at any time by a majority vote of the council. The mayor chairs the city council and the school committee, and does not have the power to veto any vote.

From 1949 through 1959, elections were by the single transferable vote. Voters repealed that system in November 1960. Despite non-partisan elections, two groups alternated in control of council: the local Democratic Party and a slate known as the Citizens&#x27; Plan E Association (CEA). CEA members included the Republican Party leadership and other groups not affiliated with the regular Democratic Party.
In 1983, Worcester voters again decided to change the city charter. This &quot;Home Rule&quot; charter (named for the method of adoption of the charter) is similar to Plan E, the major changes being to the structure of the council and the election of the mayor. The 9-member Council became 11, 6 at-large and 1 from each city district. The mayor is chosen by popular election, but must also run and win as an at-large councilor.

===Politics===

Worcester&#x27;s history of social progressivism includes a number of temperance and abolitionist movements. It was a leader in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement: The first national convention advocating women&#x27;s rights was held in Worcester on October 23–24, 1850.

Two of the nation&#x27;s most radical abolitionists, Abby Kelley Foster and her husband Stephen S. Foster, adopted Worcester as their home, as did Thomas Wentworth Higginson, the editor of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; and Emily Dickinson&#x27;s avuncular correspondent, and Unitarian minister Rev. Edward Everett Hale.

The area was already home to Lucy Stone, Eli Thayer, and Samuel May Jr. They were joined in their political activities by networks of related Quaker families such as the Earles and the Chases, whose organizing efforts were crucial to the anti-slavery cause in central Massachusetts and throughout New England.

Anarchist Emma Goldman and two others opened an ice cream shop in 1892. &quot;It was spring and not yet warm,&quot; Goldman later wrote, &quot;but the coffee I brewed, our sandwiches, and dainty dishes were beginning to be appreciated. Within a short time, we were able to invest in a soda-water fountain and some lovely colored dishes.&quot;

On October 19, 1924, the largest gathering of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) ever held in New England took place at the Agricultural Fairgrounds in Worcester. Klansmen in sheets and hoods, new Knights awaiting a mass induction ceremony, and supporters swelled the crowd to 15,000. The KKK had hired more than 400 &quot;husky guards&quot;, but when the rally ended around midnight, a riot broke out. Klansmen&#x27;s cars were stoned and burned, and their windows smashed. KKK members were pulled from their cars and beaten. Klansmen called for police protection, but the situation raged out of control for most of the night. The violence after the &quot;Klanvocation&quot; had the desired effect: Membership fell off, and no further public Klan meetings were held in Worcester.

Robert Stoddard, owner of &quot;The Telegram and Gazette&quot;, was one of the founders of the John Birch Society.

Sixties era radical Abbie Hoffman was born in Worcester in 1936 and spent more than half of his life in the city.
==Education==
===Primary and secondary education===
Worcester Public Schools educate more than 25,000 students in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade. The system consists of 34 elementary schools, four middle schools, eight high schools, and several other learning centers such as magnet schools, alternative schools, and special education schools. The city&#x27;s public school system also administers an adult education component called &quot;Night Life&quot;, and operates a Public-access television cable TV station on channel 11.

Worcester Technical High School opened in 2006, replacing the old Worcester Vocational High School, or &quot;Voke&quot;. The city&#x27;s other public high schools include South High Community School, North High School, Doherty Memorial High School, Burncoat Senior High School, University Park Campus School, and Claremont Academy.

The Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science was founded in 1992 as a public secondary school at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

One notable charter school in the city is Abby Kelley Foster Charter Public School, which teaches kindergarten through 12th grade. It is granted status by Massachusetts as a Level 1 school. It is the one of 834 schools in the United States to offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.

Twenty-one private and parochial schools are also found throughout Worcester, including the city&#x27;s oldest educational institution, Worcester Academy, founded in 1834, and Bancroft School, founded in 1900.

===Higher education===
Worcester is currently home to eight colleges and universities.
* Assumption University is the fourth oldest Roman Catholic college in New England and was founded in 1904. At , it has the largest campus in Worcester.
* Clark University was founded in 1887 as the first all-graduate school in the country; it now also educates undergraduates and is noted for its strengths in psychology and geography. Its first president was G. Stanley Hall, the founder of organized psychology as a science and profession, father of the child study movement, and founder of the American Psychological Association. Well-known professors include Albert A. Michelson, who won the first American Nobel Prize in 1902 for his measurement of light. Robert H. Goddard, a pioneering rocket scientist of the space age also studied and taught here, and, in his only visit to the United States, Sigmund Freud delivered his five famous &quot;Clark Lectures&quot; at the university. Clark offers one of only two programs leading to a Ph.D. in Holocaust and Genocide Studies, the other is offered by Gratz College.
* College of the Holy Cross was founded in 1843 and is the oldest Roman Catholic college in New England and one of the oldest in the United States. Well-known graduates include Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Nobel laureate Joseph E. Murray; former Poet Laureate of the United States Billy Collins; Basketball Hall of Fame member Bob Cousy; attorney and professional sports&#x27; team owner Edward Bennett Williams; College Football Hall of Fame member Gordie Lockbaum; and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.

* The University of Massachusetts Medical School (1970) is one of the nation&#x27;s top 50 medical schools. Craig Mello won the 2006 Nobel Prize for Medicine. 
* Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) is a private research university, focusing on the instruction and research of technical arts and applied sciences. Founded in 1865, WPI was one of the United States&#x27; first engineering and technology universities and now has 14 academic departments with over 50 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in science, engineering, technology, management, the social sciences, and the humanities and arts. Robert Goddard, the father of modern rocketry, graduated from WPI in 1908 with a Bachelor of Science in physics.
* Worcester State University (WSU) is a public liberal arts and sciences university located on the city&#x27;s west side. Founded in 1874 as the State Normal School at Worcester, it was the fifth of nine public teacher training colleges in the commonwealth. Today WSU offers 34 undergraduate majors and 30 graduate programs and includes a student body of 6400.

Many of these institutions participate in the Colleges of Worcester Consortium. This independent, non-profit collegiate association includes academic institutions in Worcester and other communities in Worcester County, such as Anna Maria College in neighboring Paxton. It facilitates cooperation among the colleges and universities. One example of this being its inter-college shuttle bus and student cross registration. Worcester is also the home of Dynamy, a &quot;residential internship program&quot; in the United States. The organization was founded in 1969. The city is also home to many trade schools such as the Peterson School, Porter and Chester Institute, the Fieldstone School, and the Rob Roy Academy, among others. Additionally, the Worcester Technical High School offers adult education classes.

===Defunct institutions===
Becker College was a private college with campuses in Worcester and neighboring Leicester that closed at the end of the 2020–21 academic year. The college was formed in 1977 out of the merger of Leicester Junior College (Founded 1784 as Leicester Academy) and Becker Junior College (1887). Clark University started an equivalent program, Becker School of Design &amp; Technology, hiring the majority of the faculty from the original program at Becker College and offering transfers to Becker students.

Worcester Junior College started as a private junior college in 1905 as a branch of Worcester Youth Men&#x27;s Christian Association Institute, then its only offering was in auto mechanics. From 1926 to 1942 the college was affiliated with Northeastern University. In 1972 it was merged with the new Central New England College of Technology [CNEC].

The Oread Institute was an early women&#x27;s college that closed its doors in 1934. Founded in 1849 by Eli Thayer it counted among its graduates the founders of Spelman College.

==Media==
The &quot;Telegram &amp; Gazette&quot; is Worcester&#x27;s only daily newspaper. The paper, known locally as &quot;the Telegram&quot; or &quot;the T and G&quot;, is wholly owned by GateHouse Media of Fairport, New York.

The commonwealth&#x27;s UniMás station, WUTF-TV, channel 27, is licensed to Worcester, but operates from Needham. The region&#x27;s version of Spectrum News 1, which over the years has expanded from a community access channel to a regional cable news channel, is based in the community.

Radio stations based in Worcester include WCHC, WCUW, WSRS, WTAG, WWFX, WICN and WXLO. WCCA-TV shows on channel 194 and provides Community Cable-Access Television as well as a live stream of the channel on the station&#x27;s website.

== Infrastructure ==
===Transportation===
Worcester is served by several interstate highways. Interstate 290 (I-290) connects central Worcester to I-495 in Marlboro, the Mass Pike and I-395 in nearby Auburn and the Connecticut city of Norwich. I-190 links Worcester to Route 2 and the cities of Fitchburg and Leominster in northern Worcester County. The Pike can also be reached via a connecting segment of Route 146 from Providence.
Worcester is also served by several smaller Massachusetts state highways. Route 9 links the city to its eastern and western suburbs, Shrewsbury and Leicester. Route 9 runs almost the entire length of the state, connecting Boston and Worcester with Pittsfield, near the New York state border. Route 12 was the primary route north to Leominster and Fitchburg until the completion of I-190. Route 12 also connected Worcester to Webster before I-395 was completed. It still serves as an alternative local route. Route 146, the Worcester-Providence Turnpike, connects the city with the similar city of Providence, Rhode Island. Route 20 touches the southernmost tip of Worcester near the Massachusetts Turnpike. Route 20 is a coast-to-coast route connecting the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, and is the longest road in the United States.

Worcester is the headquarters of the Providence and Worcester, a Class II railroad operating throughout much of southern New England. The city is a significant intermodal shipping hub for CSX&#x27;s Boston Subdivision. Worcester is also the western terminus of the Framingham/Worcester commuter rail line run by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. Union Station serves as the hub for commuter railway traffic. Built in 1911, the station has been restored to its original grace and splendor, reopening to full operation in 2000. It also serves as an Amtrak stop on the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; from Boston to Chicago. In October 2008, the MBTA added 5 new trains to the Framingham/Worcester line as part of a plan to add 20 or more trains from Worcester to Boston and also to buy the track from CSX Transportation.
The Worcester Regional Transit Authority, or WRTA, manages the municipal bus system. Buses operate intracity as well as connect Worcester to surrounding central Massachusetts communities. Worcester is also served by OurBus, Peter Pan Bus Lines and Greyhound Bus Lines, which operate out of Union Station.

Worcester Regional Airport (KORH), owned and operated by Massport since 2010, lies at the top of Tatnuck Hill, Worcester&#x27;s highest point. The airport has two runways, whose lengths are and , and a $15.7 million terminal. The airport was serviced by numerous airlines from the 1950s through the 1990s. After that, the airport encountered years of spotty commercial service, but it has since been given new life with the arrival of jetBlue, Delta Air Lines, and American Airlines.
===Healthcare===

In 1830, state legislation funded the creation of the Worcester State Insane Asylum Hospital (1833) and became one of the first new public asylums in the United States. Prior the Worcester State Insane Asylum hospital, all other treatment centers were funded by private philanthropists which neglected treatment for the poor.

Worcester is home to the University of Massachusetts Medical School. The medical school is in the top quartile of medical schools nationally in research funding from the NIH and is home to highly respected scientists including a Nobel laureate, a Lasker Award recipient and multiple members of the National Academy of Sciences and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The school is closely affiliated with UMass Memorial Health Care, the clinical partner of the medical school, which has expanded its locations all over Central Massachusetts. St. Vincent Hospital at Worcester Medical Center in the downtown area rounds out Worcester&#x27;s primary care facilities. Reliant Medical Group, formerly Fallon Clinic, is the largest private multi-specialty group in central Massachusetts with over 30 different specialties. It is affiliated with St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in downtown Worcester. Reliant Medical Group was the creator of Fallon Community Health Plan, a now independent HMO based in Worcester, and one of the largest health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in the state.

===Utilities and public services===

Worcester has a municipally owned water supply. Its water filtration plant is located in Holden near two of the reservoirs. Sewage disposal services are provided by the Upper Blackstone Water Pollution Abatement District, which services Worcester as well as some surrounding communities.

National Grid USA is the exclusive &quot;distributor&quot; of electric power to the city, though due to deregulation, customers now have a choice of electric &quot;generation&quot; companies. Natural gas is distributed by NSTAR Gas; only commercial and industrial customers may choose an alternate natural gas supplier. Verizon, successor to New England Telephone, NYNEX, and Bell Atlantic, is the primary wired telephone service provider for the area. Phone service is also available from various national wireless companies. Cable television is available from Charter Communications, with broadband Internet access also provided, while a variety of DSL providers and resellers are able to provide broadband Internet over Verizon-owned phone lines.

===Public safety===
For public safety needs, the City of Worcester is protected by both the Worcester Fire Department and the Worcester Police Department.

UMass Memorial Medical Center provides emergency medical services (EMS) under contract with the city. Originally operated by Worcester City Hospital and later by the University of Massachusetts Medical School, &quot;Worcester EMS&quot; operates exclusively at the advanced life support (ALS) level, with two paramedics staffing each ambulance. UMass Memorial EMS maintains two community EMS stations and operates a fleet of 18 ambulances (including spares), as well as a special-operations trailer, several other support vehicles, and a bike team; the agency responds to an average of 100 emergencies each day. UMass Memorial EMS operates the EMS Communications Center, which is a secondary PSAP and provides emergency medical dispatch (EMD) services to Worcester and other communities.

<doc id="99316" wikidata="Q2900232" url="?curid=99316" title="Betty Cooper">
<text>Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Cooper is one of the main characters appearing in American comic books published by Archie Comics. She is the lead guitarist, percussionist and one of the three singers of The Archies. The character was created by Bob Montana and John L. Goldwater, and first appeared in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #22 (cover-dated Dec. 1941), on the first page of the first &quot;Archie&quot; story, serving as a love interest to Archie Andrews.

Betty is in love with Archie, which drives her attempts to win his affections by whatever means possible, and her rivalry with her best friend, vocalist/keyboardist Veronica Lodge, have been among the longest-running themes in the comics. She is portrayed by Lili Reinhart in &quot;Riverdale&quot; and Khushi Kapoor in &quot;The Archies&quot;.

== Publication history ==

Betty was named for, and originally based on, Betty Tokar Jankovich, a Czech immigrant who briefly dated Archie co-creator Bob Montana in 1939 when she was 18. Created to serve as a love interest for Archie Andrews, she is portrayed as a smart, talented, sweet, tomboyish yet beautiful girl with blonde hair and blue eyes.

In addition to appearing in many Archie stories, Betty was the star of two long-running comic book titles published by Archie Comics during the period 1965–2012: &quot;Betty and Me&quot; (later styled as &quot;Betty &amp; Me&quot;), which published 200 issues from Aug. 1965 to Aug. 1992; and &quot;Betty&quot;, which published 195 issues from Sept. 1992 to Jan. 2012. She also was featured in &quot;Betty&#x27;s Diary&quot;, which published 40 issues from Apr. 1986–Apr. 1990.

Currently, Betty is the co-star of &quot;Betty and Veronica Digest Magazine&quot;, now known as &quot;B&amp;V Friends Double Digest&quot;, which was launched in Nov. 1980 and has published more than 250 issues; and &quot;Betty and Veronica Double Digest&quot;, which has published 250+ issues since June 1987.

She was the co-star of &quot;Betty and Veronica&quot;, which ran for 347 issues (and eight annuals) from March 1950–April 1987. A new &quot;Betty and Veronica&quot; series published 278 issues from June 1987–late 2015. The limited series &quot;Betty and Veronica&quot;, taking place in their rebooted New Riverdale universe, was published in 2017. Betty and Veronica also co-starred in:
* &quot;Betty and Veronica Spectacular&quot; (90 issues, Oct. 1992–July 2009)
* &quot;Betty and Veronica Summer Fun&quot; (six annual issues, 1994–1999)

== Fictional character biography ==
Betty Cooper is the third and youngest child and second daughter of Hal Cooper and Alice Cooper. Her older brother Chic Cooper and older sister Polly Cooper have moved out of Riverdale, their hometown. Chic moved to New York City and Polly to San Francisco, but both occasionally appear in flashbacks to Betty&#x27;s childhood, and both occasionally visit their family.

The quintessential girl next door, Betty&#x27;s middle class upbringing is a world apart from the flashy lifestyle of her wealthy friend, Veronica Lodge. Nowhere is this more evident than when she and Veronica are competing for Archie Andrews&#x27; heart, and yet they remain best friends (Veronica once told Archie that she and Betty are only rivals in unimportant matters, like boys).

In the late 1960s, the two girls joined Archie&#x27;s band, a garage band appropriately named The Archies. Both sang, and Betty played a tambourine, while Veronica played an organ. Some stories indicate that Betty is the better vocalist. Additionally, there is little consistency in the instruments she is able to play. Betty has played the recorder, tambourine, maracas, guitar, banjo, keyboard, saxophone, cello, and the bongos.

==Interests and personality==
Betty is friends with everybody, and is a loving daughter and sister. She likes to help the homeless, read to senior citizens, and rescue wounded animals and birds.

Betty&#x27;s hobbies include playing sports (particularly baseball), cooking (the gang thinks her cooking is excellent), and looking after animals (she owns a cat, Caramel). She is also concerned with the environment and other social issues and encourages the rest of the gang to clean up after themselves. She loves children and sometimes babysits Jellybean with Jughead as well as other children in Riverdale. Occasionally, families hire Betty to keep their elderly members company. Betty is a skilled mechanic who frequently helps Archie with his broken down car Betsy. Betty is also good at skiing and car-racing. She is often said to be the best pitcher in the girls&#x27; baseball team. Betty is a scuba diver, wearing a red shorty wetsuit, breathing with an air tank she carries on her back and a regulator in her mouth, wears red fins on her feet and a mask on her face, but she prefers to swim underwater.

Betty has an above-average intelligence and is one of the smartest students at Riverdale High School, along with Dilton Doiley. In one story she won an award and was sent to compete in New York and has won numerous academic awards. At one point, she gained ESP when an encyclopedia accidentally fell on her head. This ability took away all hope for the future; Archie asked Veronica for a date, but Betty knew that Archie would dump Veronica for her. Betty lost her ESP power when a ball that Reggie kicked accidentally hit her; in her gratefulness, she gave him a thankful kiss.

Betty&#x27;s many talents and accomplishments often make her friend Veronica jealous, who then tries to sabotage Betty to steal her glory and make her look bad.

During a stay at the Lodge mansion, while the family are in Europe, Betty is waited on hand and foot by the servants and, true to her personality, she quickly begins to feel guilty about being waited on. Wanting to do something very special for them in appreciation for the tough jobs that they do (and for what also seems to be a thankless job in serving someone like Veronica, who tends to be harsh and rude towards those who serve her), she throws them a pool party which surprises Mr. and Mrs. Lodge and Veronica. In return, Smithers, the butler, and the rest of the staff, who are amazed by what Betty did for them (since they never seem to get any appreciation from Veronica), offer to help Betty with the next party she throws, for free. Mr. Lodge would then scold Veronica about her harsh treatment towards them, much to her embarrassment.

On the TV show &quot;Riverdale&quot;, Betty participates in many extracurricular activities at Riverdale High School, including cheerleader with the other members of The River Vixens, writing for The Blue and Gold with Jughead Jones and discovering the true identities and intentions/actions of many people in Riverdale, including Clifford Blossom (Cheryl Blossom&#x27;s father), Penelope Blossom (Cheryl Blossom&#x27;s mother), Hal Cooper, and Robert Phillips (a.k.a. The Sugarman).

==Relationships==
Betty&#x27;s best friend is Veronica. Although the two are often involved in disputes over Archie or something else that evokes jealousy, they have remained friends. The two have commented that Jughead and Archie&#x27;s friendship could not compare to theirs. In many stories, Betty and Veronica team up or help each other despite Veronica&#x27;s jealousy and bitterness towards her. Betty&#x27;s other female friends include Ethel Muggs, Midge Klump, and Nancy Woods, all of whom share common interests and group activities such as shopping and cheer-leading.

Frequently, Betty has been shown to flirt with and date bassist Reggie Mantle early on in the titles&#x27; runs and occasionally still, more often than not as a casual date. Once Betty said that sometimes the way Archie and Reggie fight over her, it sounds like she has the plague. In the Life with Archie magazines that depict a future timeline in which Archie marries Veronica, Betty and Reggie are portrayed as a loving couple. It has been hinted they may be planning to get married.

Betty&#x27;s relationship with Jughead Jones has mostly been that of close confidant and close friend, as they normally discuss their issues more candidly with each other than anyone else; Jughead will provide commentary on her feelings for Archie, and Betty will attempt to &quot;better&quot; Jughead, by getting rid of his slothful attitude and laziness. Once when she had a sprained ankle, Veronica told both Archie and Jughead to visit her. The four of them were having dinner together when people from the school mistook Jughead as Betty&#x27;s boyfriend because he was carrying chocolates to her house. Jughead appears to care more about Betty than other girls and there have been hints of a potential romantic relationship between them. He once accidentally asked her out to a school dance. When he was telling Archie what to do, Betty walked up behind him and thought he was asking her even though he was just demonstrating how to ask Betty to the dance. In one story, Jughead even says that if the time ever comes that he would willingly kiss a girl, it would be Betty. A happy tear is seen sliding down Betty&#x27;s face at this comment.

She had a friendship with an elderly woman named Lydia Wyndham, whom she found when doing research about World War I. With this acquaintance, Betty got to know an accomplished writer and poet with a sharp mind (and a sad past—Betty&#x27;s research had turned up a beau of Ms. Wyndham&#x27;s who was killed in combat), but after a while, Ms. Wyndham herself died.

At times, Betty is seen to have a close friendship with Cheryl Blossom, especially in Cheryl&#x27;s own title. However, at other times, Betty and Veronica regard the seductive Cheryl as a threat because she tries to lure Archie away from them, and the two best friends unite against Cheryl to protect their interests. Jason Blossom, Cheryl&#x27;s twin brother, is sometimes seen to have a genuine interest in Betty, which makes Archie jealous.

In the late &#x27;90s, Betty started dating Adam Chisholm. It was thought by some people that Betty had chosen Adam over Archie. This event made Archie jealous and he concentrated his attention on Betty, ignoring Veronica, as he always does when he thinks someone else may take Betty away from him. Though in actuality, Adam has rarely been seen in the stories after that story arc, and Betty has continued to prefer Archie.

==Career==
Betty enjoys writing and keeps a diary that is featured in the series &quot;Betty&#x27;s Diary&quot;. She wants to be a famous writer someday, an aspiration that her teacher Miss Grundy approves of and encourages. She submits her work to writing magazines and has been published a number of times. She once got to be an intern for a fashion magazine but ended up modeling as well. At the same time, she takes various types of employment, including some work as a mechanic, which is also a career that she is interested in. In some stories she finds employment as an assistant teacher at the local elementary school. Betty is also a well-known babysitter and baker.

==Reception==
In 2011, Betty Cooper was ranked 66th in &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&#x27;s&quot; &quot;100 Sexiest Women in Comics&quot; list written by Brent Frankenhoff.

==Other versions==

===&quot;Jughead: The Hunger&quot;===
In &quot;&quot;, Betty hails from a long-line of werewolf hunters that have always taken down the Jones werewolves. She only befriended Archie and faked her affections towards him in an effort to get closer to the newest werewolf of Riverdale, Jughead. Archie convinces her to try curing Jughead with wolfsbane, which initially works until it wears off and results in Reggie&#x27;s death and resurrection/metamorphosis. Jughead leaves town because he knows Betty won&#x27;t give him a second chance. Betty sets out to find him with the help of Archie and her cousin Bo, with backing by her aunt, the Cooper family matriarch, Elena.

===&quot;Life with Archie: The Married Life&quot;===
Betty appears as a main character in &quot;Life with Archie: The Married Life&quot;. In &quot;Archie Loves Veronica&quot;, she runs a catering business while her boyfriend, Reggie Mantle, runs a repair shop. They both star in a reality show based on their lives. In &quot;Archie Loves Betty&quot;, she is an English teacher at Riverdale High. However, in both universes, Betty previously worked as a buyer for Saks Fifth Avenue in New York.

<doc id="99319" wikidata="Q2098453" url="?curid=99319" title="Burgh Castle">
<text>Burgh Castle is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk.

Burgh Castle is located south-west of Great Yarmouth and east of Norwich. The parish was part of Suffolk until 1974.
==History==
Burgh Castle was likely the site of a Neolithic settlement due to an abundance of flint and bronze axe-heads being discovered in the area.

Burgh Castle is the location of a Roman fortification called &quot;Gariannonum&quot; which dates to the third century; the fort was part of system of coastal defence, the Saxon Shore, against Anglo-Saxon incursions on the East Anglian coast. The site is managed by the Norfolk Archaeological Trust and is open free of charge to the public.

Bradwell&#x27;s name is of mixed Anglo-Saxon and Norman origin and derives from the Old English &quot;burh&quot; (meaning fort) and the Norman French &#x27;castle.&#x27;

It has been suggested by the Elizabethan historian William Camden, that Burgh Castle is the site of Cnobheresburg, the first Irish monastery in southern England founded by Saint Fursey in the seventh century as part of the Hiberno-Scottish mission.

In the Domesday Book, Burgh Castle is recorded as a settlement of 15 households in the hundred of Lothingland. In 1086, the village was part of the estates of Ralph the Bowman.

Burgh Castle was also the site of a Norman castle.

Burgh Castle was once used to imprison Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany.

Other listed buildings in Burgh Castle include Church Farmhouse (c.1788), the Old Rectory (c.1832) and the Grange (Seventeenth Century).

== Geography ==
According to the 2021 census, Burgh Castle has a population of 1,323 people which shows an increase from the 1,150 people recorded in the 2011 census.

The northern boundary of the parish is marked by the confluence of the River Waveney and River Yare. The village is also within the Norfolk Broads.

Amenities within the village include two pubs (The Queen&#x27;s Head and The Fisherman&#x27;s Inn) as well as the Burgh Hall Bar &amp; Restaurant and Golden Fish (a Chinese Takeaway).

==St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s Church==
Burgh Castle&#x27;s parish church is dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul and is one of Norfolk&#x27;s 124 remaining round-tower churches. St. Peter and St. Paul&#x27;s is located on Church Road and has been Grade II listed since 1954. The church incorporates significant amounts of Roman brick in its foundations, almost certainly from the nearby Roman fort. 

== Governance ==
Burgh Castle is part of the electoral ward of Lothingland for local elections and is part of the district of Great Yarmouth.

The village&#x27;s national constituency is Great Yarmouth which has been represented by the Reform UK&#x27;s Rupert Lowe since 2024.

== War memorial ==
Burgh Castle has two war memorials, both located inside St. Peter and St. Paul&#x27;s Church. The memorial for the First World War is a metal embossed plaque whilst the memorial for the Second World War is a wooden plaque which was unveiled by Field Marshal Edmund Ironside GCB DSO in 1953. The memorial lists the following names for the First World War:

And, the following for the Second World War:

And, Mr. Clive G. Harvey of the Merchant Navy.

<doc id="99322" wikidata="Q3011" url="?curid=99322" title="Steinburg">
<text>Steinburg () is a district in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, administered from Itzehoe. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the districts of Dithmarschen, Rendsburg-Eckernförde, Segeberg and Pinneberg, and by the Elbe River (and the district of Stade beyond).

==History==

The district&#x27;s name is derived from a medieval castle called Steinburg, where the reeves ruled by order of their lords, the dukes of Holstein. This castle was first mentioned in 1307, and it was abandoned and demolished in 1630. However, Steinburg remained the name of the region, and its new centre became Glückstadt before gradually moving to the town of Itzehoe.

When Schleswig-Holstein became a province of Prussia in 1867, the district of Steinburg was established. The borders remained unchanged until 1970 when the newly founded town Schenefeld (formerly part of Rendsburg district) joined Steinburg.

==Geography==

The district is situated on the northern bank of the Elbe river, close to its mouth. The countryside is very plain. The Stör river, a right-hand tributary of the Elbe, flows through the district. Today the towns in Steinburg gradually become a part of the growing Hamburg metropolitan area. The lowest land point of the Federal Republic of Germany at 3,54 meters below sea level is located near the city of Wilster. Steinburg&#x27;s highest point is the Itzespitze (83.4 m).

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays a castle (symbolising Steinburg Castle) above a wavy line (representing the Elbe river). Below the castle&#x27;s towers there are three shields depicting Christ, a nettle leaf (from the arms of Holstein) and a swan.

<doc id="99326" wikidata="Q92619" url="?curid=99326" title="Richard Hamming">
<text>Richard Wesley Hamming (February 11, 1915 – January 7, 1998) was an American mathematician whose work had many implications for computer engineering and telecommunications. His contributions include the Hamming code (which makes use of a Hamming matrix), the Hamming window, Hamming numbers, sphere-packing (or Hamming bound), Hamming graph concepts, and the Hamming distance.

Born in Chicago, Hamming attended University of Chicago, University of Nebraska and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he wrote his doctoral thesis in mathematics under the supervision of Waldemar Trjitzinsky (1901–1973). In April 1945, he joined the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory, where he programmed the IBM calculating machines that computed the solution to equations provided by the project&#x27;s physicists. He left to join the Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1946. Over the next fifteen years, he was involved in nearly all of the laboratories&#x27; most prominent achievements. For his work, he received the Turing Award in 1968, being its third recipient.

After retiring from the Bell Labs in 1976, Hamming took a position at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, where he worked as an adjunct professor and senior lecturer in computer science, and devoted himself to teaching and writing books. He delivered his last lecture in December 1997, just a few weeks before he died from a heart attack on January 7, 1998.

== Early life ==
Hamming was born in Chicago, Illinois, on February 11, 1915, the son of Richard J. Hamming, a credit manager, and Mabel G. Redfield. His father was Dutch, and his mother was a Mayflower descendant. He grew up in Chicago, where he attended Crane Technical High School and Crane Junior College.

Hamming initially wanted to study engineering, but money was scarce during the Great Depression, and the only scholarship offer he received came from the University of Chicago, which had no engineering school. Instead, he became a science student, majoring in mathematics, and received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1937. He later considered this a fortunate turn of events. &quot;As an engineer,&quot; he said, &quot;I would have been the guy going down manholes instead of having the excitement of frontier research work.&quot;

He went on to earn a Master of Arts degree from the University of Nebraska in 1939, and then entered the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he wrote his doctoral thesis on &quot;Some Problems in the Boundary Value Theory of Linear Differential Equations&quot; under the supervision of Waldemar Trjitzinsky. His thesis was an extension of Trjitzinsky&#x27;s work in that area. He looked at Green&#x27;s function and further developed Jacob Tamarkin&#x27;s methods for obtaining characteristic solutions. While he was a graduate student, he discovered and read George Boole&#x27;s &quot;The Laws of Thought&quot;.

The University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign awarded Hamming his Doctor of Philosophy in 1942, and he became an instructor in mathematics there. He married Wanda Little, a fellow student, on September 5, 1942, immediately after she was awarded her own Master of Arts in English literature. They would remain married until his death, and had no children. In 1944, he became an assistant professor at the J.B. Speed Scientific School at the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky.

== Manhattan Project ==
With World War II still ongoing, Hamming left Louisville in April 1945 to work on the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory, in Hans Bethe&#x27;s division, programming the IBM calculating machines that computed the solution to equations provided by the project&#x27;s physicists. His wife Wanda soon followed, taking a job at Los Alamos as a human computer, working for Bethe and Edward Teller. Hamming later recalled that:

Hamming remained at Los Alamos until 1946, when he accepted a post at the Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL). For the trip to New Jersey, he bought Klaus Fuchs&#x27;s old car. When he later sold it just weeks before Fuchs was unmasked as a spy, the FBI regarded the timing as suspicious enough to interrogate Hamming. Although Hamming described his role at Los Alamos as being that of a &quot;computer janitor&quot;, he saw computer simulations of experiments that would have been impossible to perform in a laboratory. &quot;And when I had time to think about it,&quot; he later recalled, &quot;I realized that it meant that science was going to be changed&quot;.

== Bell Laboratories ==

At the Bell Labs Hamming shared an office for a time with Claude Shannon. The Mathematical Research Department also included John Tukey and Los Alamos veterans Donald Ling and Brockway McMillan. Shannon, Ling, McMillan and Hamming came to call themselves the Young Turks. &quot;We were first-class troublemakers,&quot; Hamming later recalled. &quot;We did unconventional things in unconventional ways and still got valuable results. Thus management had to tolerate us and let us alone a lot of the time.&quot;

Although Hamming had been hired to work on elasticity theory, he still spent much of his time with the calculating machines. Before he went home on one Friday in 1947, he set the machines to perform a long and complex series of calculations over the weekend, only to find when he arrived on Monday morning that an error had occurred early in the process and the calculation had errored off. Digital machines manipulated information as sequences of zeroes and ones, units of information that Tukey would christen &quot;bits&quot;. If a single bit in a sequence was wrong, then the whole sequence would be. To detect this, a parity bit was used to verify the correctness of each sequence. &quot;If the computer can tell when an error has occurred,&quot; Hamming reasoned, &quot;surely there is a way of telling where the error is so that the computer can correct the error itself.&quot;

Hamming set himself the task of solving this problem, which he realised would have an enormous range of applications. Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if you know which bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept of the number of positions in which two code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one code word into another, which is today known as the Hamming distance. Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical error-correcting codes, which are called Hamming codes. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science, it opened up a whole new field of study.

The Hamming bound, also known as the sphere-packing or volume bound is a limit on the parameters of an arbitrary block code. It is from an interpretation in terms of sphere packing in the Hamming distance into the space of all possible words. It gives an important limitation on the efficiency with which any error-correcting code can utilize the space in which its code words are embedded. A code which attains the Hamming bound is said to be a perfect code. Hamming codes are perfect codes.

Returning to differential equations, Hamming studied means of numerically integrating them. A popular approach at the time was Milne&#x27;s Method, attributed to Arthur Milne. This had the drawback of being unstable, so that under certain conditions the result could be swamped by roundoff noise. Hamming developed an improved version, the Hamming predictor-corrector. This was in use for many years, but has since been superseded by the Adams method. He did extensive research into digital filters, devising a new filter, the Hamming window, and eventually writing an entire book on the subject, &quot;Digital Filters&quot; (1977).

During the 1950s, he programmed one of the earliest computers, the IBM 650, and with Ruth A. Weiss developed the L2 programming language, one of the earliest computer languages, in 1956. It was widely used within the Bell Labs, and also by external users, who knew it as Bell 2. It was superseded by Fortran when the Bell Labs&#x27; IBM 650 were replaced by the IBM 704 in 1957.

In &quot;A Discipline of Programming&quot; (1976), Edsger Dijkstra attributed to Hamming the problem of efficiently finding regular numbers. The problem became known as &quot;Hamming&#x27;s problem&quot;, and the regular numbers are often referred to as Hamming numbers in Computer Science, although he did not discover them.

Throughout his time at Bell Labs, Hamming avoided management responsibilities. He was promoted to management positions several times, but always managed to make these only temporary. &quot;I knew in a sense that by avoiding management,&quot; he later recalled, &quot;I was not doing my duty by the organization. That is one of my biggest failures.&quot;

== Later life ==
Hamming served as president of the Association for Computing Machinery from 1958 to 1960. In 1960, he predicted that one day half of the Bell Labs budget would be spent on computing. None of his colleagues thought that it would ever be so high, but his forecast actually proved to be too low. His philosophy on scientific computing appeared as the motto of his &quot;Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers&quot; (1962): 

In later life, Hamming became interested in teaching. Between 1960 and 1976, when he left Bell Labs, he held visiting or adjunct professorships at Stanford University, Stevens Institute of Technology, the City College of New York, the University of California at Irvine and Princeton University. As a Young Turk, Hamming had resented older scientists who had used up space and resources that would have been put to much better use by the young Turks. Looking at a commemorative poster of the Bell Labs&#x27; valued achievements, he noted that he had worked on or been associated with nearly all of those listed in the first half of his career at Bell Labs, but none in the second. He therefore resolved to retire in 1976, after thirty years.

In 1976 he moved to the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, where he worked as an adjunct professor and senior lecturer in computer science. He gave up research, and concentrated on teaching and writing books. He noted that:

Hamming attempted to rectify the situation with a new text, &quot;Methods of Mathematics Applied to Calculus, Probability, and Statistics&quot; (1985). In 1993, he remarked that &quot;when I left BTL, I knew that that was the end of my scientific career. When I retire from here, in another sense, it&#x27;s really the end.&quot; And so it proved. He became Professor Emeritus in June 1997, and delivered his last lecture in December 1997, just a few weeks before his death from a heart attack on January 7, 1998. He was survived by his wife Wanda.

Hamming&#x27;s final recorded lecture series is maintained by Naval Postgraduate School along with ongoing work that preserves his insights and extends his legacy.

<text>Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (; born Luiz Inácio da Silva; 27 October 1945), known mononymously as Lula, is a Brazilian politician who is the 39th and current president of Brazil since 2023. A member of the Workers&#x27; Party, Lula was also the 35th president from 2003 to 2011.

Described as left-wing, his first presidency coincided with South America&#x27;s first pink tide. During his first two consecutive terms in office, he continued fiscal policies and promoted social welfare programs such as Bolsa Família that eventually led to growth in GDP, reduction in external debt and inflation, and helping 20 million Brazilians escape poverty. He also played a role in foreign policy, both on a regional level and as part of global trade and environment negotiations. During those terms, Lula was considered one of the most popular politicians in Brazil&#x27;s history and left office with 80% approval rating. His first term was marked by notable scandals, including the Mensalão vote-buying scandal. After the 2010 Brazilian general election, he was succeeded by his former chief of staff, Dilma Rousseff, and remained active in politics and gave lectures.

Lula quit school after second grade to work, and did not learn to read until he was ten years old. As a teenager, he worked as a metalworker and became a trade unionist. Between 1978 and 1980, he led workers&#x27; strikes during Brazil&#x27;s military dictatorship, and in 1980, he helped start the Workers&#x27; Party during Brazil&#x27;s political opening. Lula was one of the leaders of the 1984 Diretas Já movement, which demanded direct elections. In 1986, he was elected a federal deputy in the state of São Paulo. He ran for president in 1989, but lost in the second round. He went on to also lose two other presidential elections, both in 1994, and then in 1998. He finally became president in 2002, in a runoff. In 2006, he was successfully re-elected in the second round.

In July 2017, Lula was convicted on charges of money laundering and corruption in the Operation Car Wash context, after which he spent a total of 580 days in prison. He attempted to run in the 2018 Brazilian presidential election, but was disqualified under Brazil&#x27;s &quot;Ficha Limpa&quot; law. He was convicted again in February 2019, and was released from prison the following November. His two convictions were nullified in 2021 by the Supreme Court, in a ruling which also found serious biases in the first case against him, also annulling all other pending cases. Now legally allowed to make another run for president, he did so in the 2022 election and ultimately defeated the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro in a runoff. Sworn in on 1 January 2023 at the age of 77, he is the oldest Brazilian president at time of inauguration, as well as the first-ever candidate to have defeated an incumbent president and to be elected to a third term.

== Early life ==
Luiz Inácio da Silva was born on 27 October 1945 (registered with a date of birth of 6 October 1945) in Caetés (then a district of Garanhuns), from Recife, capital of Pernambuco, a state in the Northeast of Brazil. He was the seventh of eight children of Aristides Inácio da Silva and Eurídice Ferreira de Melo, farmers who had experienced famine in one of the poorest parts of the agreste. He was raised Catholic. Lula&#x27;s mother was of Portuguese and partial Italian descent. Two weeks after Lula&#x27;s birth, his father moved to Santos, São Paulo, with – though Eurídice was not aware of it – her younger cousin Valdomira Ferreira de Góis.

In December 1952, when Lula was seven years old, his mother moved the family to São Paulo to rejoin her husband. After a journey of 13 days in a (open truck bed), they arrived in Guarujá and discovered that Aristides had formed a second family with Valdomira, with whom he had 10 more children. Aristides&#x27;s two families lived in the same house for some time, but they did not get along very well, and four years later, his mother moved with him and his siblings to a small room behind a bar in São Paulo. After that, Lula rarely saw his father, who died illiterate and an alcoholic in 1978. In 1982, he added the nickname Lula to his legal name.

== Personal life ==
Twice a widower, Lula has been married three times, and has a daughter from a fourth relationship. In 1969, he married Maria de Lourdes Ribeiro. She died of hepatitis in 1971 while pregnant with a child, who also died.

In March 1974, Lula had an illegitimate daughter, Lurian, with his then-girlfriend, Miriam Cordeiro. The two never married. Lula only began participating in his daughter&#x27;s life when she was already a young adult.

Two months later, in May 1974, Lula married Marisa Letícia Rocco Casa, a 24-year-old widow whom he had met the prior year. He had three sons with her, and adopted her son from her first marriage. The two remained married for 43 years, until her death on 2 February 2017, after a stroke.

Later that same year, he met and started a relationship with Rosângela da Silva, known as Janja. The relationship only became public in 2019 while he was serving time in jail in Curitiba, Paraná, on corruption charges. Lula and Janja married on 18 May 2022.

Lula is Catholic.

== Education and work ==
Lula had little formal education. He did not learn to read until he was ten years old. He quit school after the second grade to work. His first job at age eight was as a street vendor. When he was 12, he also worked as a shoeshiner. In 1960, when he was 14, he got his first formal job, in a warehouse.

In 1961, he started working as an apprentice of a press operator in a metallurgical company that produced screws, while studying in a vocational course. There, Lula had his first contact with strike movements. After the movement failed in its negotiations, Lula left the company for another metallurgical company. From 1966 to 1980, he worked at , a new metalworking firm.

There, in 1974, he lost his left pinky finger in a machinery accident, while working as a press operator in the factory. After the accident, he had to run to several hospitals before he received medical attention. This experience increased his interest in participating in the Workers&#x27; Union. Around that time, he became involved in union activities and held several union posts.

== Union career ==
Inspired by his brother Frei Chico, a member of the Brazilian Communist Party, Lula joined the labour movement when he worked at Villares Metals, rising through the ranks. He was elected in 1975, and re-elected in 1978, as president of the Steel Workers&#x27; Union of São Bernardo do Campo and Diadema. Both cities are located in the ABCD Region, home to most of Brazil&#x27;s automobile manufacturing facilities, including Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota, and Mercedes-Benz.

In the late 1970s, when Brazil was under military rule, Lula helped organize union activities, including major strikes. Labour courts found the strikes illegal, and in 1980, Lula was jailed for a month. Due to this, and like other people imprisoned for political activities under the military government, Lula was awarded a lifetime pension after the fall of the military regime.

== Political career ==

On 10 February 1980, a group of academics and union leaders, including Lula, founded the &quot;Partido dos Trabalhadores&quot; (PT) or Workers&#x27; Party, a left-wing party with progressive ideas. In 1983, he helped found the Central Única dos Trabalhadores (CUT) trade union association.

=== Elections ===

Lula first ran for office in 1982 for the state government of São Paulo, but lost with 11% of the vote. Cuban president Fidel Castro urged him to continue on as a politician, during a trip by Lula to Cuba. In the 1986 election, Lula won a seat in the National Congress with the most votes nationwide.

In 1989, Lula ran for president as the PT candidate. Lula advocated immediate land reform and that Brazil default on its external debt. A minor candidate, Fernando Collor de Mello, quickly amassed support with a more business-friendly agenda and by taking emphatic anti-corruption positions. He beat Lula in the second round of the 1989 elections. Lula decided not to run for re-election as a Congressman in 1990.

Lula ran again for president, and lost again, in the next two Brazilian elections. Former PSDB Minister of Finance Fernando Henrique Cardoso defeated Lula who received only 27% of the vote in the presidential elections in 1994, and again, by a somewhat smaller margin, as Lula garnered only 32% of the vote in 1998.

An article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that before 2002, Lula had been a &quot;strident union organizer known for his bushy beard and Che Guevara T-shirts&quot;. In the 2002 campaign, Lula abandoned both his informal clothing style and his platform plank that Brazil should not pay its foreign debt unless it links the payment to a prior thorough audit. This last point had worried economists, businessmen, and banks, who feared that even a partial Brazilian default would have a massive ripple effect through the world economy. Lula in the 2002 election, defeated PSDB candidate José Serra in a runoff, to become the country&#x27;s first leftist president following the fall of the military dictatorship in Brazil. In the 2006 election, Lula won a run-off over the PSDB&#x27;s Geraldo Alckmin.

In September 2018, Brazil&#x27;s top electoral court banned Lula from running for president in 2018 due to his corruption conviction, in accordance with Brazil&#x27;s &quot;Lei da Ficha Limpa&quot; law. Instead, Fernando Haddad ran for president on the Workers Party ticket, and was defeated by Jair Bolsonaro.

== First presidency (2003–2011) ==
Lula, described as left-wing, served two terms as president from 2003 through 2010. During his farewell speech, he said he felt a burden to prove that he could handle the presidency despite his humble beginnings. &quot;If I failed, it would be the workers&#x27; class which would be failing; it would be this country&#x27;s poor who would be proving they did not have what it takes to rule&quot;.

=== Political orientation ===

Very few of the reforms that Lula proposed were actually implemented during Lula&#x27;s terms of office. Some wings of the Worker&#x27;s Party disagreed with the increasing moderation in focus since the late eighties, and left the party to form other parties, such as during Lula&#x27;s presidency, the Socialism and Liberty Party. Alliances with old, traditional oligarch politicians, like former presidents José Sarney and Fernando Collor, have been a cause of disappointment for some.

=== Education ===

A number of educational initiatives were launched during Lula&#x27;s first presidency. A free school meals programme was extended to 37 million pupils while a programme was launched which aimed to provide &quot;whole or partial remission of student fees for low-income students&quot;. In 2006, primary education was extended from 8 to 9 years. A Fund for the Maintenance and Development of Basic Education was set up to improve the quality of education. The PED (an education development plan) conditioned the disbursement of public funds to state schools on the schools&#x27; performance.

Still in 2006, many Brazilians and commentators felt that Lula had not done enough to improve the quality of public education. And in 2010, while education was compulsory for all children in Brazil aged 7 to 14, in practice that requirement was only loosely enforced; 90% of children in rural areas attended school for less than four years, and only 25% of children living in favelas attended school.

=== Social programmes ===

Lula&#x27;s top social programme sought to eradicate hunger. It was financed by an increase in tax revenues, coupled with a decrease in government expenditures on both wages and on benefits paid to public employees, as well as a decrease in government expenditures on infrastructure. The programme followed the lead of a project that had already been put into practice in 1995 by the Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration, which was named &quot;Bolsa Escola&quot; (School Stipend). It expanded that initiative with the new &quot;Fome Zero&quot; (&quot;Zero Hunger&quot;) programme, which was part of the &quot;Bolsa Família&quot; (Family Allowance) plan.

Five months after Lula took office, however, the budget for &quot;Fome Zero&quot; was cut down a third from its original amount, and one year later, about $800 million was budgeted toward the programme, but only $130 million of that was actually disbursed. Lula&#x27;s programme was accused of having become more bark than bite, inasmuch as of May 2005, two years after the effort began, the programme had fallen far short of expectations.
During Lula&#x27;s first term, child malnutrition decreased by 46%. In May 2010, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) awarded Lula the title of &quot;World Champion in the Fight against Hunger&quot;. A number of other social projects were introduced during Lula&#x27;s first presidency.

Lula launched a housing aid programme that was larger in scope to the policies developed until then. More than 15 billion euros were invested in water purification and the urbanization of favelas, and more than 40 billion in housing. The government proposed to relocate the poor populations that occupied the &quot;risk zones&quot;, prone to floods or landslides; at the end of the day, however, at least 212 people died and at least 15,000 people were made homeless by the April 2010 Rio de Janeiro floods and mudslides alone. It proposed to then extend the electricity network, to relocate the streets and to improve the precarious housing. The government undertook to democratize access to real estate credit.

=== Economy ===
Lula&#x27;s first two terms coincided with a strong boom in commodities prices. This fueled an economic boom in Brazil, which in turn allowed Lula to spend heavily on social programmes and pay off a $15 billion IMF loan a year early.

In the run-up to the 2002 elections, the fear of Lula taking drastic measures, and comparisons of him with Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, increased internal market speculation. This led to a drop in the value of the Brazilian real, and a downgrade of Brazil&#x27;s credit rating. Lula chose Henrique Meirelles of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), a market-oriented economist, as head of the Brazilian Central Bank. As a former CEO of BankBoston he was well known to the market.

Lula and his cabinet followed, to an extent, the lead of the previous government in economics. It renewed all agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which were signed by the time Argentina defaulted on its own deals in 2001. His government achieved a satisfactory primary budget surplus in the first two years, as required by the IMF agreement, exceeding the target for the third year. In late 2005, the government paid off its debt to the IMF in full, two years ahead of schedule. The Brazilian economy was generally not affected by the 2005 Mensalão scandal, which related to vote buying in the Brazilian Congress.
In June 2005, economist and attorney José Dirceu, Lula&#x27;s chief-of-staff since 2003, resigned after he was caught up in a massive corruption scheme in the legislature, the Mensalão corruption scandal. In March 2006, Lula&#x27;s finance minister Antonio Palocci, who had continued the anti-inflation and pro-market policies of the previous centrist government, resigned due to his involvement in a corruption and abuse of power scandal. Lula then appointed Guido Mantega, a PT economist, as finance minister.

Not long after the start of his second term, in 2007 Lula&#x27;s government announced the Growth Acceleration Programme (&quot;&quot;, PAC), an investment programme which sought to solve many of the problems that prevented the Brazilian economy from expanding more rapidly. The measures included investment in the creation and repair of roads and railways, simplification and reduction of taxation, and modernization of the country&#x27;s energy production to avoid further shortages. The money pledged to be spent on this programme was to be around R$ 500 billion (US $ billion) over four years. However, by 2010 many projects remained mired in bureaucracy, and only 11% of the projects outlined in the plan had been completed, while just over half had not even been launched.

Prior to taking office, Lula had been a critic of privatization. His administration created public-private partnership concessions for seven federal roadways. After decades with the largest foreign debt among emerging economies, Brazil became a net creditor for the first time in January 2008. By mid-2008, both Fitch Ratings and Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s had elevated the classification of Brazilian debt from speculative to investment grade. Banks made record profits under Lula&#x27;s government.
The crash of Wall Street in 2008 might have been a tsunami in the US and Europe, Lula declared, but in Brazil it would be no more than a little &#x27;ripple&#x27; (&quot;&quot;). The phrase was seized on by the Brazilian press as proof of Lula&#x27;s reckless economic ignorance and irresponsibility. In 2008, Brazil enjoyed economic good health to fight the global financial crisis with a large economic stimulus lasting, at least, until 2014. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;: &quot;Under Lula, Brazil became the world&#x27;s eighth-largest economy, [and] more than 20 million people rose out of acute poverty ...&quot;

At the same time, in 2010 &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; noted that: &quot;[Brazil&#x27;s] public sector is bloated and riddled with corruption. Crime is rampant. Its infrastructure is badly in need of repair and expansion. The business environment is restrictive, with a labour code ripped from the pages of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s economic playbook. Brazil also risks patting itself on the back so much that it fails to see the colossal work that remains to be done.&quot;

=== Environment ===
Initially, Lula&#x27;s administration pushed for progressive policies that significantly curbed deforestation in the Amazon. Despite this, he did not support legislation that would have required the country to phase out its fossil fuels.

In May 2008, environmental minister Marina Silva resigned, blamed &quot;stagnation&quot; in the government, after she lost disagreements with Lula when she opposed approval of new hydroelectric dams in the Amazon and criticized Lula&#x27;s biofuels programme. Dr. Daniel Nepstad of the Woods Hole Research Centre said the growing demand for biofuels may ultimately result in more Amazon deforestation. In particular, environmentalists warn that while biofuels reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, they may well also trigger a significant expansion of the biofuel crops; that, in turn, may push agriculture deeper into forests, destroying habitat and biodiversity.
The creation of conservation areas and indigenous reserves led to a decrease of around 75% in deforestation starting in 2004. In Lula&#x27;s first year in office, in 2003–04, 25,000 square kilometers of Brazilian forest were destroyed, the second-worst devastation since 1977. In late 2006, the Instituto Soicioambiental environmental group said that deforestation in Lula&#x27;s first four years had been worse than in any four-year period since 1988. By 2009, Brazil&#x27;s Amazon destruction—though lower—was still about 7,000 square kilometers a year, larger than the US state of Delaware. Critics said, however, that Brazil&#x27;s lowest rate of deforestation in 2009 was a function of the global financial crisis. Paulo Adario of Greenpeace said that it was a function not of efforts to protect the climate, but of the fact that the &quot;demand for beef, soya and wood ha[d] dramatically fallen&quot;.

In 2009, Lula gave a speech in which he said that &quot;gringos&quot; should pay Amazon nations to prevent deforestation.

In February 2010, Lula&#x27;s government approved the construction of a controversial hydroelectric mega Belo Monte Dam in the middle of the Amazon rain forest in the Brazilian state of Pará. It was to be the third-largest hydroelectric dam in the world. Environmental activists protested the building of the dam. It was expected to cause a significant decline in the water table, resulting in significant losses of aquatic and terrestrial fauna, and adversely impact aquatic mammals. Approximately 20,000-40,000 indigenous people were to be resettled with little or no compensation, and 516 square kilometers (199 square miles) of rain forest were to be flooded for the dam&#x27;s construction.

=== Foreign policy ===



In 1979, Lula was asked in an interview which historical figures he admired most. He answered: Gandhi, Che Guevara, and Mao Zedong. Upon being asked to give additional examples, he added Fidel Castro saying: &quot;I admire in a man the fire to want to do something, and then his going out to try to do it.&quot;

Leading a large agricultural state, Lula generally opposed and criticized farm subsidies, and this position has been seen as one of the reasons for the walkout of developing nations and subsequent collapse of the Cancún World Trade Organization talks in 2003 over G8 agricultural subsidies. Brazil played a role in negotiations regarding internal conflicts in Venezuela and Colombia, and made efforts to strengthen Mercosur. During the Lula administration, Brazilian foreign trade increased dramatically, changing from deficits to several surpluses after 2003. In 2004, the surplus was US$29 billion, due to a substantial increase in global demand for commodities. Brazil also provided UN peacekeeping troops and led a peacekeeping mission in Haiti.

According to &quot;The Economist&quot; of 2 March 2006, Lula had a pragmatic foreign policy, seeing himself as a negotiator, not an ideologue, a leader adept at reconciling opposites. As a result, he befriended both Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez and U.S. President George W. Bush. Former Finance Minister, and current advisor, Delfim Netto, said: &quot;Lula is the ultimate pragmatist&quot;.

He travelled to more than 80 countries during his presidency. A goal of Lula&#x27;s foreign policy was for the country to gain a seat as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. In this he was unsuccessful.

====China====
From 2003 to 2010, Lula embraced China as central to reforming what he considered an unjust global order. He intertwined the Chinese and Brazilian economies. Lula stated Brazil&#x27;s commitment to the One China principle that is the position held by the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the ruling Chinese Communist Party, saying that the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China was the sole legal government representing the whole of China, including Taiwan—as part of China.

==== Cuba ====
Lula and Cuban president Fidel Castro were longtime friends. Under Lula, Brazil provided money and corporate support to Cuba. The state-controlled Brazilian oil company Petrobras studied the possibility of drilling for oil off of Cuba, while the Odebrecht construction firm headed a revamp of the Cuban port of Mariel into the island&#x27;s main commercial port. Brazil&#x27;s state-run Brazilian Development Bank gave $300 million to Odebrecht to build new roads, rail lines, wharves, and warehouses at Mariel. Brazil also offered Cuba up to $1 billion in credit lines to pay for Brazilian goods and services.

==== Iran ====

The conviction by an Iranian court of Iranian Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani for the crime of adultery, with a sentence in 2006 of execution by stoning, led to calls for Lula to intercede on her behalf. In July 2010, Lula said &quot;I need to respect the laws of a [foreign] country. If my friendship with the president of Iran and the respect that I have for him is worth something, if this woman has become a nuisance, we will receive her in Brazil&quot;. The Iranian government declined his offer. Mina Ahadi, an Iranian Communist politician, welcomed Lula&#x27;s offer, but reiterated a call for an end to stoning altogether and requested a cessation of recognition and support for the Iranian government. Jackson Diehl, deputy editorial page editor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, called Lula the &quot;best friend of tyrants in the democratic world,&quot; and criticised his actions. Shirin Ebadi, Iranian human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate called Lula&#x27;s comments a &quot;powerful message to the Islamic Republic&quot;.

In 2009, Lula warmly hosted Iranian president Ahmadinejad, who made a controversial visit to Brazil. Some demonstrators expressed displeasure over Ahmadinejad&#x27;s positions on human rights and his denial of the Holocaust.

In May 2010, Lula and Turkey&#x27;s prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan negotiated a preliminary fuel swap agreement with the Iranian government on uranium enrichment, that ultimately failed. The preliminary agreement that they presented to the United Nations was at odds with what the International Atomic Energy Agency and other countries viewed as necessary actions to stop Iran from obtaining weapons grade materials. Within hours of signing the agreement, Iran did an about-face and announced that it would continue to enrich some uranium. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Brazil was being &quot;used&quot; by Tehran. The UN Security Council ultimately rejected it when permanent member country representatives argued that &quot;the swap proposal negotiated by Brazil and Turkey would leave Iran with enough material to make a nuclear weapon,&quot; and that &quot;Iran intends to continue a new programme of enriching uranium to a higher level.&quot; Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Thomas Friedman wrote: &quot;Is there anything uglier than watching democrats sell out other democrats to a Holocaust-denying, vote-stealing Iranian thug just to tweak the U.S. and show that they, too, can play at the big power table?&quot; Moisés Naím, editor in chief of &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine and former Minister of Trade in Venezuela, said &quot;Lula is a political giant, but morally he has been a deep disappointment.&quot; In 2010, in addition, Brazilians largely disagreed with Lula as to how to handle Iran and Iran&#x27;s nuclear weapons programme. While Lula opposed additional international economic sanctions against Iran, of the 85% of Brazilians who opposed Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, two-thirds approved of tighter international sanctions on Iran to try to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons.

==== Iraq ====
In 2003, Lula condemned the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, saying that the United States had no right &quot;to decide unilaterally what is good and what is bad for the world&quot;. He said that &quot;the behaviour of the United States in relation to Iraq has weakened the United Nations&quot;.

====Libya====

Brazil, as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, abstained from the vote authorising &quot;all necessary measures&quot; against Libya&#x27;s Muammar Gaddafi. It opposed the bombing in Libya to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. Lula said: &quot;These invasions only happen because the United Nations is weak.&quot;

==== Venezuela ====
Lula was close with Venezuela&#x27;s president Hugo Chávez, a close ally of Communist Cuba and an antagonist of the United States. In November 2007, Lula defended Chávez as the democratic choice of his people. He said: &quot;There is no risk with Chávez.&quot; Expressing his admiration for Chávez, he said &quot;Only thanks to Chávez&#x27;s leadership, the people [of Venezuela] have had extraordinary achievements,&quot; and that in 2008 that Chávez was &quot;the best president the country has had in 100 years.&quot; However, in 2010 Brazilians largely had a different view than Lula, as only 13% had at least some confidence in Chávez, while 70% had little or no confidence in him.

=== Freedom of the press ===
After Lula was infuriated by a May 9, 2004, &quot;New York Times&quot; article that claimed he had a drinking problem, Brazil ordered the &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter, Larry Rohter, to leave the country and revoked his visa because he had written a story &quot;offensive to the honour of the president.&quot; Lula said: &quot;Certainly its author ... must be more worried than I am ... it deserves action.&quot; Brazil&#x27;s presidential palace threatened to take legal action against the &quot;New York Times&quot;, which stood by the story and said that the expulsion raised serious questions about freedom of expression and freedom of the press in Brazil. No journalist had been expelled from Brazil since its military dictatorship ended in the mid-1980s. Brazilian opposition senator Tasso Jereissati said: &quot;This is ridiculous. It&#x27;s more like the immature act of a dictator of a third-rate republic...&quot; Brazil&#x27;s second largest union, Força Sindical, issued a statement expressing concern that: &quot;it is a reaction typical of authoritarian governments that don&#x27;t like contrary voices.&quot; Despite criticism, on May 13, 2004, Lula said &quot;he would not consider revoking the action.&quot; The government subsequently changed its position, and allowed the reporter to remain.

Three months later, Lula introduced legislation to create a Brazil National Journalists&#x27; Council that would have the power to &quot;orient, discipline and monitor&quot; journalists and their work. Critics called the draft law the worst affront to press freedom since censorship under the military dictatorship. The government also proposed the establishment of a National Cinema and Audiovisual Agency that would have the power to conduct prior reviews of programming and to veto certain programmes if they believed that they did not to meet standards of &quot;editorial responsibility.&quot;

== Corruption scandals and controversy ==
Lula&#x27;s administration was plagued by numerous corruption scandals, notably the Mensalão $50 million vote-buying scandal and during Lula&#x27;s first term.

=== Mensalão vote-buying scandal ===
In the 2005 Mensalão $50 million vote-buying scandal, Brazilian attorney general Álvaro Augusto Ribeiro Costa presented charges against 40 politicians and officials involved in the Mensalão affair, including several charges against Lula himself. Lula said that he knew nothing about the scandals.

Among those convicted were Jose Dirceu (who was Lula&#x27;s chief of staff and right-hand man from 2003 to 2005; he was sentenced to over 10 years in jail), and both the former head of Lula&#x27;s Workers Party, Jose Genoino, and its treasurer, Delubio Soares. Dirceu and officials Luiz Gushiken and Humberto Costa said that Lula was not involved. Roberto Jefferson said that if Lula didn&#x27;t &quot;commit a crime by action, he committed it by omission.&quot; But one of Lula&#x27;s own party members, Arlindo Chinaglia, alleged that Lula had been warned about the matter, and businessman Marcos Valério, who was sentenced to more than 40 years in prison for his involvement in the scandal, alleged in testimony after he was convicted that Lula had authorized loans for the scheme and used some of the money to pay for his personal expenses.

=== Politicking ===
His administration was criticized for relying on local, right-of-centre political barons, like José Sarney, Jader Barbalho, Renan Calheiros and Fernando Collor to ensure a majority in Congress. Another frequent reproach was his ambiguous treatment of the left wing of the PT. Analysts felt that he would occasionally give in to left-wing calls for tighter government control on media and increased state intervention: in 2004, he pushed for the creation of a &quot;Federal Council of Journalists&quot; (CFJ) and a &quot;National Cinema Agency&quot; (Ancinav), the latter designed to overhaul funding for electronic communications. Both proposals ultimately failed amid concerns over the effect of state control on free speech.

=== Great Recession caused by white people with blue eyes ===
Before a G-20 summit in London in March 2009, Lula caused an uproar by declaring that the economic crisis was caused by &quot;the irrational behavior of white people with blue eyes, who before seemed to know everything, and now have shown they don&#x27;t know anything&quot;. He added: &quot;I don&#x27;t know any black or indigenous bankers.&quot; He repeated the accusation the following month.

=== Terrorist Cesare Battisti ===
When Italian far-left terrorist Cesare Battisti of the Armed Proletarians for Communism, wanted for four murders, was arrested in Rio de Janeiro in March 2007 by Brazilian and French police officers, Brazilian Minister of Justice Tarso Genro granted him status as a political refugee. It was a controversial decision, which divided Italy and the Brazilian and international press. In February 2009, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in support of Italy, and held a minute&#x27;s silence in memory of Battisti&#x27;s victims. In November 2009, the Brazilian Supreme Court declared the grant of refugee status illegal and allowed Battisti&#x27;s extradition, but also stated that the Brazilian constitution gave the president the personal power to deny the extradition if he chose to, effectively putting the final decision in the hands of Lula.

Lula barred Battisti&#x27;s extradition. On 31 December 2010, Lula&#x27;s last day in office, his decision not to allow Battisti&#x27;s extradition was officially announced. Battisti was released on 9 June 2011 from prison, after the Brazilian Constitutional Court denied Italy&#x27;s request to extradite him. Italy planned to appeal to the International Court of Justice in the Hague, saying Brazil had breached an extradition treaty. Lula&#x27;s successor, President Michel Temer, revoked his status as a permanent resident in December and an arrest warrant was issued; Battisti then entered Bolivia illegally, and was arrested and extradited from Bolivia in January 2019.

=== Operation Zelotes ===
In 2015, Lula, along with his former chief of staff and five others, was indicted in a corruption probe as part of , regarding payment of R$6 million in bribes (US $ million). Prosecutors alleged they helped pass Provisional Measure 471 (which was later converted into Law 12,218/2010) in 2009 in order to benefit the automotive companies Grupo Caoa and MMC. On 21 June 2021, Judge Frederico Botelho de Barros Viana of the 10th Federal Court of Brasilia acquitted all the accused, saying that the prosecution did not convincingly demonstrate that the defendants were involved in a criminal conspiracy.

=== Operation Car Wash: corruption investigation and prosecution ===


In 2014, Brazil began &quot;Operação Lava Jato&quot; (English: Operation Car Wash), resulting in several arrests and convictions, including nine suits against Lula.

In April 2015, the Public Ministry of Brazil opened an investigation into allegations of influence peddling by Lula, which alleged that between 2011 and 2014 he had lobbied for government contracts in foreign countries for the Odebrecht company and had also persuaded the Brazilian Development Bank to finance the projects in Ghana, Angola, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic. In June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, president of Odebrecht, was arrested on charges that he had paid politicians $230 million in bribes. Three other company executives were also arrested, as well as the chief executive of Andrade Gutierrez, another construction conglomerate.

On 4 March 2016, as part of &quot;Operation Car Wash&quot;, Brazilian authorities raided Lula&#x27;s home. After the raid, the police detained Lula for questioning. A police statement alleged that Lula had collaborated in illegal bribes from the oil company Petrobras to benefit his political party and presidential campaign. Prosecutor Carlos Fernando said, &quot;The favours to Lula from big construction companies involved in the fraud at Petrobras were many and hard to quantify&quot;. Lula said that he and his party were being politically persecuted.

On 16 March 2016, Rousseff appointed Lula as her chief of staff, a position comparable to that of prime minister. This would have shielded him from arrest due to the immunity that went with the position. Cabinet ministers in Brazil are among close to seven hundred senior government officials enjoying special judicial standing, which means they can only be tried by Brazil&#x27;s Supreme Federal Court. Supreme Court Judge Gilmar Mendes suspended Lula&#x27;s appointment on the grounds that Rousseff was trying to help Lula circumvent prosecution.

On 28 July 2016, Lula filed a petition with the United Nations Human Rights Committee, a panel of experts, requesting that it provide a view on his accusation that Moro had violated his rights. The Committee ultimately accepted the case.

On 14 September 2016, prosecutors filed corruption charges against Lula, accusing him of being the mastermind or &#x27;maximum commander of the scheme&#x27;. On 19 September 2016, 13th Circuit (Paraná) federal judge Sergio Moro, who was leading the corruption probe, accepted an indictment for money laundering against Lula and his wife Marisa Letícia Lula da Silva. On 11 May 2017, Lula answered a summons by appearing in Curitiba and was questioned by Moro. The closed-court hearing lasted five hours. Thousands of Lula supporters went to Curitiba, together with Dilma Rousseff. After the hearing, Lula and Rousseff gave speeches to his supporters; Lula attacked what he called bias in the Brazilian media.

==== Guilty verdict and sentencing ====
Lula was found guilty by the lower court of accepting in bribes ($ US) in the form of improvements to his beachfront house, made by construction company , which in turn received lucrative contracts from the state-owned oil company Petrobras. Lula also faced other charges, including money laundering, influence peddling and obstruction of justice. On 12 July 2017, Sergio Moro sentenced Lula to nine and a half years in prison. Lula remained free pending his appeal. Lula&#x27;s lawyer accused the judge of bias and the judge replied that nobody, not even the former president, should be above the rule of law.

On 25 January 2018, the Appeal Court of Porto Alegre found Lula guilty of corruption and money laundering and increased his sentence to 12 years of prison for one of the nine charges, while the other eight were still pending. On 26 March 2018, that same court upheld its own sentence, thus ending the case in that court.

==== Prison ====
On 5 April 2018, Brazil&#x27;s Supreme Federal Court (STF) voted 6–5 to deny Lula&#x27;s &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition. The court ruled that Lula must begin serving his sentence relating to his 12 July 2017 graft conviction for taking bribes from an engineering firm in return for help land contracts with state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, despite him not having exhausted all of his appeals, but rather only one appeal, at which the appellate court had unanimously upheld his sentence. Brazilian financial markets rallied, as the decision increased the chances a market-friendly candidate winning the election. Lula and his party vowed to continue his campaign from prison following the court&#x27;s decision that he must surrender himself by 6 April. The head of Brazil&#x27;s army, General Eduardo Villas Boas, called for Lula to be placed behind bars. Following Judge Moro&#x27;s issuance of an arrest warrant for Lula on 6 April 2018, Lula appealed to the UN Human Rights Committee to – in addition to his primary case – take emergency action by asking the government of Brazil to prevent his arrest until he had exhausted all appeals, arguing that the Brazilian Supreme Court had narrowly adopted its ruling with only six votes against five, which &quot;shows the need for an independent court&quot;; the Committee ultimately denied Lula&#x27;s request. In June 2018, the Committee denied Lula&#x27;s request.

Lula failed to turn himself in at the scheduled time, but he did so on the following day on 7 April 2018. After Lula was imprisoned, protesters took to the streets in cities across Brazil. Lula&#x27;s imprisonment led to the formation of the Free Lula Movement.

On 28 May 2018, the UN Human Rights Committee initiated an investigation into Lula&#x27;s case. In August, the Committee &quot;requested Brazil to take all necessary measures to ensure that Lula can enjoy and exercise his political rights while in prison, as candidate in the 2018 presidential elections&quot;; Brazil&#x27;s foreign ministry noted that the recommendation had no legal significance.

On 8 July 2018, on-call weekend duty federal judge for the 4th region Rogério Favreto ordered Lula&#x27;s release. Moro said that Favreto did not have the authority to release Lula, and Favreto&#x27;s ruling was overturned the same day by the Judge Pedro Gebran Neto, president of the 4th regional court.

On 2 August 2018, Pope Francis received three former allies of Lula in Rome: Celso Amorim, Alberto Fernández and Carlos Ominami. Later, the pope addressed a handwritten note to Lula (posted on his Twitter account) with the following text: &quot;To Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva with my blessing, asking him to pray for me, Francisco&quot;.

On 9 June 2019, &quot;The Intercept&quot; published leaked Telegram messages between the judge in Lula&#x27;s case, Sergio Moro, and the Operation Car Wash lead prosecutor, Deltan Dallagnol, in which they allegedly conspired to convict Lula to prevent his candidacy for the 2018 presidential election. Moro was accused of lacking impartiality in Lula&#x27;s trial. Following the disclosures, the resumption of legal proceedings was determined by the Supreme Court. Moro denied any wrongdoing or judicial misconduct during the course of Operation Car Wash and his investigation of Lula, claiming that the conversations leaked by &quot;The Intercept&quot; were misrepresented by the press and that conversations between prosecutors and judges are normal. Moro became Minister of Justice and Public Security after the election of president Jair Bolsonaro.

The information published by &quot;The Intercept&quot; prompted reactions both in Brazil and overseas. A group of 17 lawyers, ministers of Justice, and high court members from eight countries reacted to the leaks by describing former president Lula as a political prisoner and calling for his release. United States Senator Bernie Sanders said Lula should be released and his conviction annulled. American Congressman Ro Khanna asked the Trump administration to investigate Lula&#x27;s case, saying that &quot;Moro was a bad actor and part of a larger conspiracy to send Lula to jail&quot;. A number of international intellectuals, activists and political leaders, including professor Noam Chomsky and 12 US Congressmen, complained that the legal proceedings appeared to be designed to prevent Lula from running for president in 2018. American talk show host Michael Brooks, a vocal advocate for Lula, opined that Lula&#x27;s imprisonment and Moro&#x27;s alleged political motives had rendered the results of the 2018 election &quot;fundamentally illegitimate&quot;.

==== Release ====
On 8 November 2019, Lula was released from prison after 580 days when the Brazilian Supreme Court ended mandatory imprisonment of convicted criminals after their first appeal failed. His release allowed him to remain out of prison until all of his appeals of his corruption and money laundering convictions were exhausted.

On 27 November, the in Porto Alegre increased Lula&#x27;s sentence to 17 years.

On 8 March 2021, Judge Edson Fachin of the Supreme Federal Court annulled all convictions against Lula, ruling that the court in Curitiba, in Paraná state, which convicted him lacked jurisdiction to do so because the crimes he was accused of did not take place in that state, as at the time Lula resided in the capital, Brasilia. Justice Fachin said the cases against him should therefore be retried by a court in that city. The judge did not rule as to whether Lula was guilty or not of the corruption charges. On 15 April, a full Supreme Court upheld the ruling in an 8–3 decision.

On 23 March 2021, the Supreme Federal Court ruled by a 3–2 decision that Moro, who had overseen Lula&#x27;s trial in a case, was biased against him. On 23 June it upheld the ruling in a 7–4 decision. On 24 June, Judge Gilmar Mendes of the Supreme Federal Court annulled the two other cases Moro had brought against Lula, reasoning that there was a link between them and the case in which Moro was declared biased. This meant that all evidence Moro had collected against Lula was inadmissible in court, and that fresh trials would be needed.

== Between terms (2011–2023)==
=== Health ===
On 29 October 2011, it was announced that Lula, a former smoker, had a malignant tumor in his larynx, which was detected after his voice became unusually hoarse. He had chemotherapy to treat the tumor, and was later treated with radiation therapy; his laryngeal cancer went into remission. Lula announced his recovery in March 2012.

On 21 January 2021, Lula tested positive for COVID-19 while participating in the filming of an Oliver Stone documentary in Cuba, five days after arriving on the island. He recovered without needing to be admitted to hospital. On 13 March 2021, Lula received his first dose of the CoronaVac vaccine.

In October 2023, Lula had hip joint replacement surgery for a hip prosthesis, replacing the top of his right femur with an implant to treat his arthrosis.
 He also had a blepharoplasty, a cosmetic plastic surgery to remove excess skin from both of his eyelids.

=== 2018 presidential campaign ===

In 2017, Lula announced he would stand as the Workers&#x27; Party candidate for president again in the 2018 election. In September, he led a caravan of supporters which travelled through the states of Brazil, starting with Minas Gerais, whose governor was Lula&#x27;s political ally Fernando Pimentel. While traveling through the South of Brazil, the caravan became the target of protests. In Paraná, a campaign bus was shot at, and in Rio Grande do Sul, rocks were thrown at pro-Lula militants.

Despite Lula&#x27;s imprisonment in April 2018, the Workers&#x27; Party kept Lula as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate. In a poll conducted by Ibope in June 2018, Lula led with 33% of vote intentions, with the PSL candidate Jair Bolsonaro polling second with 15%. Lula negotiated a national coalition with the PCdoB and regional alliances with the Socialist Party.

The Workers&#x27; Party officially nominated Lula as its candidate on 5 August 2018, in São Paulo. Actor Sérgio Mamberti read a letter written by Lula, who was unable to attend because of his prison sentence. Former São Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad was named as Lula&#x27;s running mate and intended to represent Lula in events and debates. If Lula was declared ineligible, Haddad would replace Lula as candidate, with Manuela d&#x27;Ávila replacing Haddad as the vice-presidential candidate.

In response to a petition from Lula, the UN Human Rights Committee on 17 August 2018 suggested to the Brazilian government that it allow Lula to exercise his political rights.

In a 26 August poll, Lula had 39 percent of vote intentions within one month of the first round. The same opinion polling put Lula ahead of all his challengers in a second round run-off, including the nearest one, PSL candidate Jair Bolsonaro, by 52 to 32.

Lula&#x27;s candidacy was denied by the Superior Electoral Court on 31 August 2018 by a majority vote of the seven-judge panel. On 11 September 2018, Lula officially withdrew and was replaced by Fernando Haddad, whom Lula endorsed.

== Second presidency (2023–present) ==
=== 2022 election ===
In May 2021, Lula said that he would run for a third term in the October 2022 general election, against the incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro. He was 17% ahead of Bolsonaro in a poll in January 2022. In April 2022, Lula announced that his running mate would be Geraldo Alckmin, a three-term governor of São Paulo state who had run against Lula in the 2006 presidential elections.

On 2 October, in the first round vote, Lula was in first place with 48% of the electorate, qualifying for the second round with Bolsonaro, who received 43% of the votes. Lula was elected in the second round on 30 October with 50.89% of the vote, the smallest margin in the history of Brazil&#x27;s presidential elections, three days after his 77th birthday. He became the first president of Brazil elected to three terms, the first since Getúlio Vargas to serve in non-consecutive terms, and the first to unseat an incumbent president. He was sworn in on 1 January 2023. At age 77, he was the oldest Brazilian president at the time of inauguration.

=== Tenure ===

Lula said that his main commitments were: the reconstruction of the country in the face of the economic crisis; democracy, sovereignty and peace; economic development and stability; fighting poverty; education; implementation of a National System of Culture and the expansion of housing programmes. He held the presidency of the G20 from 2023 (succeeding India) until the 2024 Brazilian G20 Summit, where after this the presidency was handed over to South Africa.

Lula&#x27;s popularity declined; in September 2023, 38% of those polled considered him to be good or excellent, while 30% considered him to be average, and 31% viewed him as bad or terrible.

==== Foreign policy ====
===== China =====

In March 2023, Lula met in China with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and signed 15 memoranda of understanding and 20 agreements on a wide range of issues. Lula gave a speech in which he said that no one would keep Brazil from improving its relationship with China—which was taken as a reference to the United States. In January 2024, Lula reaffirmed to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi his recognition of China&#x27;s policy of &quot;one China&quot;, under which China claims Taiwan. Human Rights Watch, in the meantime, cautioned Lula against cozying up to China, while remaining silent about China&#x27;s human rights abuses.

===== Cuba =====
In September 2023, Lula called Cuba a &quot;victim&quot; of an &quot;illegal&quot; United States embargo against Cuba. He also denounced the inclusion of Cuba on the US list of state sponsors of terrorism.

=====Iran=====
In March 2023, Lula&#x27;s administration allowed two Iranian Navy warships, forward base ship IRIS &quot;Makran&quot; and frigate IRIS &quot;Dena&quot;, to dock in Rio de Janeiro. U.S. Ambassador to Brazil Elizabeth Bagley said that in the past the warships had facilitated terrorist activities, and US Senator Ted Cruz said that &quot;the docking of Iranian warships in Brazil is a dangerous development and a direct threat to the safety and security of Americans.&quot;

Lula endorsed admitting Iran into the BRICS club, and in August 2023 met with Iranian president Ebrahim Raeisi. Lula stopped short of condemning Iran&#x27;s rights abuses.

=====Nicaragua=====
In June 2023, at an Organization of American States (OAS) summit, Lula tried to soften OAS criticism of Nicaragua&#x27;s government, which was accused of repression and of violations of human rights and property rights. Nicaragua&#x27;s former ambassador to the OAS, Arturo McFields, said that the proposed softening was &quot;shameful,&quot; and that &quot;President Lula is lying and telling another story that never existed in Nicaragua.&quot;

===== Russia=====

In May 2023, he declined an invitation to the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum, saying that he &quot;can&#x27;t visit Russia at the moment&quot;, while confirming that he had spoken to Putin. In December 2023, Lula said he would invite Vladimir Putin to the BRICS and G20 summits in Brazil. Due to Brazil being a signatory of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Putin could be placed under arrest by the Brazilian authorities if he sets foot on Brazil&#x27;s territory. Lula said Putin could be arrested in Brazil, but that would be the decision of Brazil&#x27;s independent courts, not his government. In February 2024, he was visited by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Lula cancelled his trip to the October 2024 BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia after suffering a minor brain hemorrhage from a fall.

===== Russian invasion of Ukraine =====

Lula has commented often on the Russo-Ukrainian War. He condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but Ukraine called some of his comments as &quot;Russian attempts to distort the truth&quot;.

In May 2022, Lula blamed both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy for Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, saying that Zelenskyy &quot;is as responsible as Putin for the war&quot;. Lula also repeatedly criticized NATO and the European Union for being partially responsible for the war. He accused NATO of &quot;claiming for itself the right to install military bases in the vicinity of another country&quot;. In April 2023, Lula declared after a state visit to China that &quot;the United States needs to stop encouraging war and start talking about peace&quot;. U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby responded by accusing Lula of &quot;parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda&quot;, describing his comments as &quot;simply misguided&quot; and &quot;suggesting the United States and Europe are somehow not interested in peace, or that we share responsibility for the war&quot;.

In April 2023, Lula initially condemned Russia&#x27;s violation of Ukraine&#x27;s territorial integrity and said Russia should withdraw from Ukrainian territory it has occupied since February 2022. Later, however, that same month, he suggested that Ukraine should &quot;give up Crimea&quot; to Russia in exchange for peace and Russia&#x27;s withdrawal from Ukrainian territory it occupied after February 2022, saying Zelenskyy &quot;cannot want everything&quot;.

After Germany appealed to Lula to provide military aid to Ukraine by selling it arms, Lula refused. On 26 April, in a joint press conference, Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez questioned Lula&#x27;s position, stressing that as the victimized country Ukraine needed to be supported. Lula said that he is seeking peace in accordance with a binding foreign policy principle in the pacifist Brazilian Constitution of 1988. He said that the countries of the Global South, including Brazil, India, Indonesia and China &quot;want peace&quot;, but both Putin and Zelenskyy &quot;are convinced that they are going to win the war&quot; and do not want to talk about peace. He noted the human cost of the war, as well as the war&#x27;s impact on food security, energy costs, and global supply chains.

===== Saudi Arabia =====

In November 2023, Lula met in Riyadh with the prime minister and crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman. They discussed strengthening bilateral relations, and investments in both countries. Salman said that a more robust strategic partnership between the two countries would benefit both sides. The $10 billion that the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia pledged to invest in Brazil was one topic of conversation. Lula mentioned Brazil&#x27;s rapprochement with Arab countries. Salman also discussed Saudi Arabia&#x27;s entry into BRICS in January 2024. Lula invited Salman to visit Brazil in 2024.

In February 2024, Saudi Ambassador to Brazil Faisal Ghulam participated in a reception held by the ambassadors of Arab and Islamic countries in honour of Lula, and on behalf of the ambassadors of the Arab and Islamic countries, Ghulam delivered a speech in which he reviewed the developing relations between the Arab and Islamic countries and Brazil.

===== Israel–Palestine war =====
Lula condemned the Hamas attack on Israel carried out on 7 October 2023. On 11 October 2023, he called for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war, stating, it was &quot;urgently needed in defence of Israeli and Palestinian children&quot;. Lula urged Hamas to release kidnapped Israeli children and Israel to stop bombing the Gaza Strip and allow Palestinian children and their mothers to leave the war zone. On 25 October 2023, Lula stated, &quot;It&#x27;s not a war, it&#x27;s a genocide&quot;. On 18 February 2024, he drew comparisons to the Nazi Holocaust. That same day, he was accused of &quot;blatant antisemitism&quot; by Dani Dayan, the Chairman of Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Centre, for comparing Israel&#x27;s actions to Adolf Hitler. Brazil&#x27;s ambassador to Israel Frederico Meyer was recalled after these comments, and President Lula was designated a &quot;persona non grata&quot; in the State of Israel. Lula subsequently declined to apologise and despite having invoked a comparison with Adolf Hitler, he stated &quot;I did not say the word Holocaust, that was the interpretation of the prime minister of Israel, it was not mine.&quot;

=====United States=====

In April 2023, alluding to the support of the United States for Ukraine in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lula said that the US needs to &quot;stop encouraging war.&quot; In May 2023, he said that US economic sanctions on Venezuela were &quot;worse than a war&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; women and children. In February 2024, University of São Paulo foreign policy expert Feliciano de Sa Guimaraes said Lula only listens to one side in his government, &quot;the left-wing, anti-American voices who very aggressively speak of a radical change in the global order.&quot;

=====Venezuela=====
Lula restored diplomatic ties that Brazil had cut off with Venezuela&#x27;s Nicolas Maduro government after 2018 elections that had been condemned by critics as a sham. In March 2023, Lula refused to join 54 other nations and sign a United Nations declaration criticizing Venezuela&#x27;s human rights abuses. In May 2023 Lula met with Maduro in Brazil.

In May 2023, Lula warmly embraced and fully supported Venezuela&#x27;s authoritarian leftist President Nicolás Maduro. Lula dismissed charges against Maduro of human rights and civil rights abuses as a political &quot;constructed narrative.&quot; Lula was criticized by Uruguay&#x27;s President Luis Lacalle Pou, who said that the &quot;worst thing we can do&quot; is pretend there are no significant human rights problems in Venezuela, and by Chile&#x27;s President Gabriel Boric, who said that Lula was making light of human rights violations in Venezuela. Lula also criticized as &quot;unjustified&quot; U.S. sanctions on Venezuela for its alleged human rights abuses, and criticized the United States for denying the legitimacy of Maduro, who the U.S. said had not allowed free elections.

==== Economy ====

In March 2023, Lula reinforced the &quot;Bolsa Família&quot; program. The programme was created during the first term of Lula and then significantly cut by Jair Bolsonaro, with its goal being help to around 60 million Brazilians suffering from poverty. According to the World Bank estimates, the reinforced programme would reduce the poverty rate in Brazil to 24.3% – the level before the COVID-19 pandemic.

In August 2023, Lula announced a vast infrastructure investment programme of over $350 billion over four years. Part of this sum is earmarked to finance the &quot;My home, my life&quot; social housing project. It also includes 100 billion for energy and 65 billion for transport and roads. Education and health are also concerned, with the construction of schools and hospitals. The project also aims to boost economic growth and develop clean energy.

At the beginning of September, he presented a major plan to eradicate hunger, as 33 million Brazilians do not have enough to eat, and more than half the country is affected to varying degrees by some form of food insecurity. To this end, he set up a national network of food banks to prevent wastage, increased the budget allocated to school meals and increased the purchase of food from family farms to supply public canteens. These measures are part of a broader policy to build social housing and raise the minimum wage and other social benefits. The fight against world hunger is also high on the Brazilian president&#x27;s international agenda.

In the first quarter of 2023, Brazilian economy grew by 1.9%. In the second quarter, by 0.9%, 3 times more than expected, while many of the neighbors of Brazil saw a shrinkage in their economy. The possible reasons of this phenomenon included reduced inflation, a good harvest, and an improved credit rating. The economic policy of Lula regarding taxation, spending, public ownership of some companies probably played a major role in this. Explaining his economic philosophy Lula once said: &quot;&quot;[Brazilians] need to understand that the money that exists in this country needs to circulate in the hands of many people,&quot; &quot;We do not want the concentration of wealth. We want more people to have access to credit to make the wheel of the economy turn. The growing economy needs to be distributed.&quot;

==== Environment ====

During his campaign, Lula pledged to end illegal logging. In 2004, Lula had presented a road map for curbing deforestation. It was part of &quot;The Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon&quot;, which sought to decrease deforestation in the Amazon by 80% by 2020. This plan was largely responsible for the 83% decrease in the Amazon deforestation rate in the years 2004 through 2012, but it was suspended during Bolsonaro&#x27;s presidency. Lula re-affirmed the plan&#x27;s goals in his third term, with a new target of zero illegal deforestation by the year 2030. The plan includes different measures for creating a sustainable economy in the Amazon region, like bioeconomy, rural credits and managed fishing.

According to Amazon Conservation&#x27;s MAAP forest monitoring programme, the deforestation rate in the Brazilian Amazon from the 1 of January to the 8 of November 2023 decreased by 59% in comparison to the same period in 2022. In July 2023 the deforestation rate was 66% lower than in July 2022. In the beginning of August Lula participated in the Belem summit, 8 Amazonian nations renewed the Amazon cooperation treaty.

However, there are concerns that illegal loggers have partly moved their action from the Amazon rainforest to Cerrado, where the environmental destruction has increased.

As a whole, the rate of primary forest loss declined in Brazil by 36% in 2023.

Bolsonaro had strongly cut spending for security in the Brazilian Amazon, and in 2022, 34 environmental defenders were murdered in this region. When Lula re-assumed office, he sent troops to restore law enforcement in the region. As of October 2023 there were still &quot;reports of violence, threats, torture, intimidation, attempts at criminalization and other non-lethal violations&quot;.

In April, Biden pledged to give $500 million to the Amazon Fund which was frozen during the rule of Bolsonaro and reactivated when Lula returned to power, to deal with climate change&quot;. According to John Kerry, the overall financial help from US to Brazil for stopping deforestation through different channels will be around 2 billion US dollars.

Lula and French president Emmanuel Macron agreed about cooperation between Brazil and France on different environmental issues, including the transmission of 1.1 billion dollars for preserving the Amazon rainforest.

Lula pledged to recognize 14 new indigenous reserves. Six were recognized as of May 2023. Lula and American president Joe Biden committed to work together on the issue.

Several hours after Lula talked about leaving fossil fuels at COP 28, his government held an auction in which it offered 603 territorial blocks for oil extraction. The territories cover 2% of the territory of Brazil, overlap with many protected areas or areas belonging to indigenous people and can result in a release of 1 gigaton of CO2.

Lula expressed support for the rebuilding of the BR-319 a project initiated by the Bolsonaro government, even though one study found it can lead to deforestation of a territory roughly equal to Florida. Lula said it can be done sustainably. However, a court blocked the decision in July 2024 saying the government did not have any plan to block deforestation that would follow the implementation of the project.

====Freedom of the press====
In March 2023, the Lula government launched a campaign to fight &quot;misinformation&quot;. The initiative was viewed by many as a tool for Lula&#x27;s administration to delegitimize criticism it faces—under the guise of &quot;fact-checking&quot;, and raised serious concerns about freedom of expression. In response, the senior programme director of the International Centre for Journalists, Christina Tardáliga, tweeted &quot;There is no such thing as government fact-checking. This appropriation of the term is misguided and offensive. What the government does is propaganda.&quot;

====Head injury====
In late October 2024, Lula suffered a fall in the official residence, which resulted in trauma to the back of his head and a small brain hemorrhage in the temporal-frontal region, prompting him to cancel, under advice from his doctors, a planned trip to a BRICS summit in Russia. In December of the same year, he was admitted to hospital after complaining of a headache. A brain haemorrhage was discovered after an MRI scan, and an emergency craniotomy was performed. The intracranial haemorrhage was attributed to his fall in October. After the operation he was reported to be recovering in intensive care.

== Political positions and philosophy ==

Lula has advocated &quot;socialism of the 21st century&quot;, but Lulism is considered to be substantially similar to social liberalism. Although he showed a moderate centre-left liberal tendency economically, he highlighted his closeness with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and negatively evaluated Juan Guaidó during the Venezuelan crisis. He is &quot;personally against&quot; abortion, but maintains that it should be treated as a public health issue.

=== Palestine ===
Lula criticized the decisions by Western countries to cut funding to UNRWA and in response pledged to the Palestinian government that Brazil would increase its funding to UNRWA. Lula has called for a two-state solution with Palestine &quot;definitively recognised as a full and sovereign state&quot;.

On 18 February 2024, Lula told reporters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia while attending the African Union Summit, &quot;What&#x27;s happening in the Gaza Strip isn&#x27;t a war, it&#x27;s a genocide... It&#x27;s not a war of soldiers against soldiers. It&#x27;s a war between a highly prepared army and women and children... What&#x27;s happening in the Gaza Strip with the Palestinian people hasn&#x27;t happened at any other moment in history. Actually, it has happened: when Hitler decided to kill the Jews&quot;.

== Honours and awards ==
The list of Lula&#x27;s awards since 2003:
* In 2008 he was awarded the UNESCO Félix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize.
* In 2012 he received the Four Freedoms Award.

== In popular culture ==
Academy Award-nominated Brazilian director Fábio Barreto directed the 2009 Brazilian biographical film &quot;Lula, Son of Brazil&quot; that depicts the life of Lula up to 35 years of age. Upon its release, it was the most expensive Brazilian film ever. The film was a commercial and critical failure. Critics charged that it was election propaganda, fostering a cult of personality.

The Netflix Brazilian series &quot;The Mechanism&quot; deals with Operation Car Wash, and has a character inspired by Lula, who is referred to as João Higino in the series.

The 2019 Brazilian documentary, &quot;The Edge of Democracy&quot;, written and directed by Petra Costa, chronicled the rise and fall of Lula and Dilma Rousseff, and the socio-political upheaval in Brazil during the period. Lula is also featured in the director&#x27;s 2024 documentary &quot;Apocalypse in the Tropics&quot;.

<text>The Royal College of Science is a higher education institution located in South Kensington; it is a constituent college of Imperial College London from 1907 until it was wholly absorbed by Imperial in 2002. Still to this day, graduates from the Faculty of Natural Sciences at Imperial College London receive an Associateship to the Royal College of Science. Organisations linked with the college include the Royal College of Science Union and the Royal College of Science Association.

== History ==
The Royal College of Science has its earliest origins in the Royal College of Chemistry founded under the auspices of Prince Albert in 1845, located first in Hanover Square and then from 1846 in somewhat cheaper premises in Oxford Street. Cash-strapped from the start as a private institution, in 1853 it was merged in with the School of Mines, founded in 1851 in Jermyn Street, and placed under the newly created British government Science and Art Department, although it continued to retain its own premises and substantially its own identity.

In 1872-3 the College of Chemistry moved into a new building at South Kensington (now the Henry Cole wing of the Victoria and Albert museum), along with the physics and biology classes previously taught at the School of Mines. The building, built on land acquired for &quot;educational purposes&quot; by the commissioners of the Great Exhibition of 1851, and next to another of Science and Art Department&#x27;s projects the South Kensington Museum (later the V&amp;A), had originally been intended to be a new school of naval architecture. But the scientists pressed the need for much better laboratory space, so the school of naval architecture instead went to Greenwich. One notable advocate for the new facilities was T.H. Huxley, who soon put them to good use, pioneering the greatly expanded use of laboratory work in biology teaching.

The Science and Art Department was keen to improve the quality of technical education, in particular the systematic training of school teachers, and so new classes in mathematics, astronomy, botany and agriculture were added, alongside the departments of mechanics, metallurgy and geology which soon also moved from Jermyn Street. (Mineralogy and mining remained behind at the Museum of Practical Geology until the 1890s). In recognition of its broadened scope the &quot;Metropolitan School of Science applied to Mining and the Arts&quot;, as it was officially known, was re-established in 1881 as the &quot;Normal School of Science and Royal School of Mines&quot;, under Huxley as dean, the name being based on that of the École Normale in Paris.

The Normal School of Science, responsible for subjects including physics, chemistry, mechanics, biology and agriculture, steadily established its own identity, and in 1890 the name Royal College of Science was granted by Royal Consent.

The RCS and the Royal School of Mines subsequently merged in 1907 with the City and Guilds Central Technical College to form the Imperial College of Science and Technology, each continuing as a Constituent College of Imperial, which then joined the University of London in 1929. This administrative structure continued until 2002, surviving Imperial&#x27;s mergers with a number of medical schools, which were formed into a fourth constituent college; and Imperial&#x27;s merger in 2000 with Wye College, of which roughly one-fifth became designated as part of the Royal College of Science.

In 2002, Imperial abolished all the constituent colleges, including the Royal College of Science, in favour of a new faculty structure. The RCS was split into the Faculties of Physical and Life Sciences. However, in 2005 it was announced that the Faculties of Physical and Life Sciences would be re-merged to form the Faculty of Natural Sciences. This re-forms the original RCS structure, encompassing all the science departments of Imperial College. Overall, it has amounted to no more than a name change from RCS to Faculty of Natural Sciences, and the new faculty students&#x27; union has resurrected the name &quot;Royal College of Science Union&quot;.

==The building==

In the years following the establishment of the Normal School of Science in 1881, space became pressing as the college expanded, so work began in 1900 on new premises. In 1906 the RCS moved into an imposing new building designed by Sir Aston Webb, which was built in a Classical style and had distinctive brick courses. It ran the length of the road today called Imperial College Road and formerly faced the Imperial Institute. The RCS building featured state of the art chemistry and physics laboratories in the east and west wings respectively, with the library of the Science Museum (later featured in the film of &quot;The Ipcress File&quot;) located in the central section between them.

The building has mostly now been demolished, the western wing in 1961 to make way for a new biochemistry building, and the central section in the mid-1970s; but part of the eastern wing still survives as the Chemistry (RCS) building.

<text>Sir William Henry Perkin (12 March 1838 – 14 July 1907) was a British chemist and entrepreneur best known for his serendipitous discovery of the first commercial synthetic organic dye, mauveine, made from aniline. Though he failed in trying to synthesise quinine for the treatment of malaria, he became successful in the field of dyes after his first discovery at the age of 18.

Perkin set up a factory to produce the dye industrially. Lee Blaszczyk, professor of business history at the University of Leeds, states, &quot;By laying the foundation for the synthetic organic chemicals industry, Perkin helped to revolutionize the world of fashion.&quot;

== Early years ==
William Perkin was born in the East End of London, the youngest of the seven children of George Perkin, a successful carpenter. His mother, Sarah, was of Scottish descent and moved to East London as a child. He was baptized in the Anglican parish church of St Paul&#x27;s, Shadwell, which had been connected to James Cook, Jane Randolph Jefferson (mother of Thomas Jefferson) and John Wesley.

At the age of 14, Perkin attended the City of London School, where he was taught by Thomas Hall, who fostered his scientific talent and encouraged him to pursue a career in chemistry.

== Accidental discovery of mauveine ==
In 1853, at the age of 15, Perkin entered the Royal College of Chemistry, now part of Imperial College London, where he began his studies under August Wilhelm von Hofmann. At this time, chemistry was still primitive: although the major elements had been discovered and techniques to analyze the proportions of the elements in many compounds were in place, it was still a difficult proposition to determine the arrangement of the elements in compounds. Hofmann had published a hypothesis on how it might be possible to synthesise quinine, an expensive natural substance much in demand for the treatment of malaria. Having become one of Hofmann&#x27;s assistants, Perkin embarked on a series of experiments to try to achieve this end.

During the Easter vacation in 1856, Perkin performed some further experiments in the crude laboratory in his apartment on the top floor of his home on Cable Street in east London. It was here that he made his great accidental discovery: that aniline could be partly transformed into a crude mixture which, when extracted with alcohol, produced a substance with an intense purple colour. Perkin, who had an interest in painting and photography, immediately became enthusiastic about this result and carried out further trials with his friend Arthur Church and his brother Thomas. Since these experiments were not part of the work on quinine which had been assigned to Perkin, the trio carried them out in a hut in Perkin&#x27;s garden to keep them secret from Hofmann.
They satisfied themselves that they might be able to scale up production of the purple substance and commercialise it as a dye, which they called mauveine. Their initial experiments indicated that it dyed silk in a way which was stable when washed or exposed to light. They sent some samples to a dye works in Perth, Scotland, and received a very promising reply from the general manager of the company, Robert Pullar. Perkin filed for a patent in August 1856, when he was still only 18.

At the time, all dyes used for colouring cloth were natural substances, many of which were expensive and labour-intensive to extract—and many lacked stability, or fastness. The colour purple, which had been a mark of aristocracy and prestige since ancient times, was especially expensive and difficult to produce. Its extraction was variable and complicated, and so Perkin and his brother realised that they had discovered a possible substitute whose production could be commercially successful.

Perkin could not have chosen a better time or place for his discovery: England was the cradle of the Industrial Revolution, largely driven by advances in the production of textiles; the science of chemistry had advanced to the point where it could have a major impact on industrial processes; and coal tar, the major source of his raw material, was an abundant by-product of the process for making coal gas and coke.
Having invented the dye, Perkin was still faced with the problems of raising the capital for producing it, manufacturing it cheaply, adapting it for use in dyeing cotton, gaining acceptance for it among commercial dyers, and creating public demand for it. He was active in all of these areas: he persuaded his father to put up the capital, and his brothers to partner with him to build a factory; he invented a mordant for cotton; he gave technical advice to the dyeing industry; and he publicised his invention of the dye.

Public demand was increased when a similar colour was adopted by Queen Victoria in Britain and by Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, in France, and when the crinoline or hooped-skirt, whose manufacture used a large quantity of cloth, became fashionable. Perkin’s mauve was cheaper than traditional, natural purple dyes and became so popular that English humourists joked about the ’mauve measles’. Everything fell into place: with hard work and lucky timing, Perkin became rich. After the discovery of mauveine, many new aniline dyes appeared (some discovered by Perkin himself), and factories producing them were constructed across Europe.

== Later years ==
William Perkin continued active research in organic chemistry for the rest of his life: he discovered and marketed other synthetic dyes, including &quot;Britannia Violet&quot; and &quot;Perkin&#x27;s Green&quot;; he discovered ways to make coumarin, one of the first synthetic raw materials of perfume, and cinnamic acid. (The reaction used to make the last became known as the Perkin reaction.) Local lore has it that the colour of the nearby Grand Union Canal changed from week to week depending on the activity at Perkin&#x27;s Greenford dyeworks.

In 1869, Perkin found a method for the commercial production from anthracene of the brilliant red dye alizarin, which had been isolated and identified from madder root some forty years earlier in 1826 by the French chemist Pierre Robiquet, simultaneously with purpurin, another red dye of lesser industrial interest, but the German chemical company BASF patented the same process one day before he did.

During the next decade, the new German Empire was rapidly eclipsing Britain as the centre of Europe&#x27;s chemical industry. By the 1890s, Germany had a near-monopoly on the business and Perkin was compelled to sell off his holdings and retire.

== Death ==

Perkin died in 1907 of pneumonia and other complications resulting from a burst appendix. He is buried in the grounds of Christchurch, Harrow, Middlesex. His will was proved on 28 August 1907 at £86,231 4s. 11d. (roughly equivalent to £ in ).

== Family ==
Perkin married Jemima Harriet, the daughter of John Lissett, in 1859, which resulted in two sons, (William Henry Perkin Jr. and Arthur George Perkin). Perkin&#x27;s second marriage was in 1866, to Alexandrine Caroline, daughter of Helman Mollwo. They had one son (Frederick Mollwo Perkin) and four daughters. All three sons became chemists.

== Honours, awards and commemorations ==

Perkin received many honours in his lifetime. In June 1866, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1879, received their Royal Medal and, in 1889, their Davy Medal. He was knighted in 1906, and in the same year was awarded the first Perkin Medal, established to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of his discovery of mauveine. Today, the Perkin Medal is widely acknowledged as the highest honour in the U.S. industrial chemistry and has been awarded annually by the American section of the Society of Chemical Industry. He was President of the Society of Chemical Industry from 1884-85.

Perkin was a Liveryman of the Leathersellers&#x27; Company for 46 years and was elected Master of the Company for the year 1896–97.

Today blue plaques mark the sites of Perkin&#x27;s home on Cable Street, by the junction with King David Lane, and the Perkin factory in Greenford, Middlesex.

A portrait, by Edward Railton Catterns (1838–1909), is owned by the University of Strathclyde.

On 12 March 2018, search engine Google showed a Google Doodle to mark Perkin&#x27;s 180th Birthday.

=== William Perkin High School ===
In 2013, the William Perkin Church of England High School opened in Greenford, Middlesex. The school is operated by the Twyford Church of England Academies Trust (which also operates Twyford Church of England High School). The school is named after William Perkin, and has adopted a mauve uniform and colour scheme, in tribute to his discovery of mauveine.

=== Imperial College London===
Since 2007, when Imperial College London gained its own Royal Charter, the Academic dress of Imperial College London features purple across the range of garments to celebrate the work of Perkin. In 2015, President of the College, Professor Alice Gast, stated that: &quot;The colour purple symbolises the spirit of endeavour and discovery, and the risk-taking nature that characterises those with an Imperial education and training.&quot;

<doc id="99340" wikidata="Q131861" url="?curid=99340" title="Sergei Rachmaninoff">
<text>Sergei Vasilyevich Rachmaninoff (28 March 1943) was a Russian composer, virtuoso pianist, and conductor. Rachmaninoff is widely considered one of the finest pianists of his day and, as a composer, one of the last great representatives of Romanticism in Russian classical music. Early influences of Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and other Russian composers gave way to a thoroughly personal idiom notable for its song-like melodicism, expressiveness, dense contrapuntal textures, and rich orchestral colours. The piano is featured prominently in Rachmaninoff&#x27;s compositional output and he used his skills as a performer to fully explore the expressive and technical possibilities of the instrument.

Born into a musical family, Rachmaninoff began learning the piano at the age of four. He studied piano and composition at the Moscow Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1892, having already written several compositions. In 1897, following the disastrous premiere of his Symphony No. 1, Rachmaninoff entered a four-year depression and composed little, until supportive therapy allowed him to complete his well-received Piano Concerto No. 2 in 1901. Rachmaninoff went on to become conductor of the Bolshoi Theatre from 1904–1906, and relocated to Dresden, Germany, in 1906. He later embarked upon his first tour of the United States as a pianist in 1909.

After the Russian Revolution, Rachmaninoff and his family left Russia permanently, settling in New York in 1918. Following this, he spent most of his time touring as a pianist through the US and Europe, from 1932 onwards spending his summers at his villa in Switzerland. During this time, Rachmaninoff&#x27;s primary occupation was performing, and his compositional output decreased significantly, completing just six works after leaving Russia. By 1942, his declining health led him to move to Beverly Hills, California, where he died from melanoma in 1943.
== Life and career ==

=== 1873–1885: Ancestry and early years ===
Rachmaninoff was born on into a family of Russian aristocracy in the Russian Empire. The family tradition claims descent from a legendary Vasily, nicknamed &quot;Rachman&quot;, a supposed grandson of Stephen III of Moldavia. Rachmaninoff&#x27;s family had strong musical and military leanings. His paternal grandfather, , was a musician who had taken lessons from Irish composer John Field. His father, Vasily Arkadievich Rachmaninoff (1841–1916), was a retired army officer and amateur pianist who married Lyubov Petrovna Butakova (1853–1929), the daughter of a wealthy army general who gave him five estates as part of her dowry. The couple had three sons: Vladimir, Sergei and Arkady and three daughters; Yelena, Sofia and Barbara; Sergei being their third child.

Rachmaninoff was born in the family estate in the village of Semyonovo, near Staraya Russa, Novgorod Governorate. His birth was registered in the Semyonovo church book. After Sergei turned four, the family moved to another house in Oneg estate, about north of Semyonovo, and the Semyonovo estate was sold in 1879 by Rachmaninoff&#x27;s father. Young Sergei Rachmaninoff was raised in Oneg estate from age four until aged nine, and he mistakenly cited it as his birthplace in his adult life. Rachmaninoff began piano and music lessons organized by his mother at age four. She noticed his ability to reproduce passages from memory without a wrong note. Upon hearing news of the boy&#x27;s gift, Arkady suggested she hire Anna Ornatskaya, a piano teacher and recent graduate of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, to live with the family and give the young Sergei formal piano lessons. Rachmaninoff dedicated his famous romance for voice and piano &quot;Spring Waters&quot; from 12 Romances, Op. 14, to Ornatskaya.

Rachmaninoff&#x27;s father, who wanted him to be trained by the Page Corps and then join the military, had to sell the five estates one by one to pay his debts due to his financial incompetence and therefore could not afford an expensive military career for him. His older brother Vladimir was sent to an ordinary military college. The last estate in Oneg was auctioned off in 1882, and the family moved to a small flat in Saint Petersburg. In 1883, Ornatskaya arranged for Rachmaninoff, now 10, to study music at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory under her former teacher, Gustav Kross. Later that year, his sister Sofia died at the age of 13 of diphtheria, and his father left the family for Moscow. His maternal grandmother Sofia Litvikova Butakova, a widow of General Butakov, stepped in to help raise the children, took care of household expenses and with particular focus on their religious life, regularly taking Rachmaninoff to Russian Orthodox Church services where he first encountered liturgical chants and church bells, two features he would incorporate in his compositions.

In 1885, Rachmaninoff suffered a further loss when his sister Yelena died at age 18 of pernicious anaemia. She was an important musical influence on Rachmaninoff and had introduced him to the works of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. As a respite, his grandmother took him to a farm retreat by the Volkhov River. At the Conservatory, however, he had adopted a relaxed attitude, played truant, failed his general education classes and purposely altered his report cards. Rachmaninoff performed at events held at the Moscow Conservatory during this time, including those attended by the Grand Duke Konstantin and other notable figures. However, upon his failing his spring exams, Ornatskaya notified his mother that his admission to further education might be revoked. His mother then consulted with Alexander Siloti, her nephew and an accomplished pianist and student of Franz Liszt. He recommended transferring Rachmaninoff to the Moscow Conservatory to receive lessons from his former teacher, the more strict Nikolai Zverev, which lasted until 1888.

=== 1885–1894: Moscow Conservatory and first compositions ===
In the autumn of 1885, Rachmaninoff moved in with Zverev, as was customary at the time, and stayed for almost four years, during which he befriended fellow pupil Alexander Scriabin. While living in Zverev’s home, Rachmaninoff shared a bedroom with three other students and took turns practicing the piano for three hours every day. After two years of tuition, the fifteen year old Rachmaninoff was awarded a Rubinstein scholarship, and graduated from the lower division of the Conservatory to become a pupil of Siloti in advanced piano, Sergei Taneyev in counterpoint, and Anton Arensky in free composition. In 1889, a rift formed between Rachmaninoff and Zverev, now his adviser, after Zverev turned down the composer&#x27;s request for assistance in renting a piano and greater privacy to compose. Zverev, who believed composition was a waste for talented pianists, refused to speak to Rachmaninoff for some time and organised for him to live with his uncle and aunt Satin and their family in Moscow. Rachmaninoff then found his first romance in Vera, the youngest daughter of the neighbouring Skalon family, but her mother objected and forbade Rachmaninoff to write to her, leaving him to correspond with her older sister Natalia. It is from these letters that many of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s earliest compositions can be traced.

Rachmaninoff spent his summer break in 1890 with the Satins at Ivanovka, their private country estate near Tambov, to which the composer would return many times until 1917. The peaceful and bucolic surroundings became a source of inspiration for the composer who completed many compositions while at the estate, including his Op. 1, Piano Concerto, which he completed in July 1891, and dedicated to Siloti. Also that year, Rachmaninoff completed the one-movement &quot;Youth Symphony&quot; and the symphonic poem &quot;Prince Rostislav&quot;. Siloti left the Moscow Conservatory after the academic year ended in 1891 and Rachmaninoff asked to take his final piano exams a year early to avoid being assigned a different teacher. Despite little faith from Siloti and Conservatory director Vasily Safonov as he had just three weeks&#x27; preparation, Rachmaninoff received assistance from a recent graduate who was familiar with the tests, and passed each one with honours in July 1891. Three days later, he passed his annual theory and composition exams. His progress was unexpectedly halted in the latter half of 1891 when he contracted a severe case of malaria during his summer break at Ivanovka.

During his final year at the Conservatory, Rachmaninoff performed his first independent concert, where he premiered his &quot;Trio élégiaque&quot; in January 1892, followed by a performance of the first movement of his Piano Concerto two months later. His request to take his final theory and composition exams a year early was also granted, for which he wrote &quot;Aleko&quot;, a one-act opera based on the narrative poem &quot;The Gypsies&quot; by Alexander Pushkin, in seventeen days. It premiered in May 1892 at the Bolshoi Theatre; Tchaikovsky attended and praised Rachmaninoff for his work. Rachmaninoff believed it was &quot;sure to fail&quot;, but the production was so successful the theatre agreed to produce it starring singer Feodor Chaliapin, who would go on to become a lifelong friend. &quot;Aleko&quot; earned Rachmaninoff the highest mark at the Conservatory and a Great Gold Medal, a distinction only previously awarded to Taneyev and Arseny Koreshchenko. Zverev, a member of the exam committee, gave the composer his gold watch, thus ending years of estrangement. On 29 May 1892, at age nineteen, Rachmaninoff graduated from the Conservatory with highest honors in both composition and piano, and was issued a diploma which allowed him to officially style himself as a &quot;Free Artist&quot;.
Upon graduating, Rachmaninoff continued to compose and signed a 500-ruble publishing contract with Gutheil, under which &quot;Aleko&quot;, Two Pieces (Op. 2) and Six Songs (Op. 4) were among the first published. The composer had previously earned 15 rubles a month in giving piano lessons at a girls’ school. He spent the summer of 1892 on the estate of Ivan Konavalov, a rich landowner in the Kostroma Oblast, and moved back with the Satins in the Arbat District. Delays in getting paid by Gutheil saw Rachmaninoff seeking other sources of income which led to an engagement at the Moscow Electrical Exhibition in September 1892, his public debut as a pianist, where he premiered his landmark Prelude in C-sharp minor from his five-part piano composition piece &quot;Morceaux de fantaisie&quot; (Op. 3). He was paid 50 rubles for his appearance. It was well received and became one of his most popular and enduring pieces. In 1893, he completed his tone poem &quot;The Rock&quot;, which he dedicated to Rimsky-Korsakov.

In 1893, Rachmaninoff spent a productive summer with friends at an estate in Kharkiv Oblast where he composed several pieces, including &quot;Fantaisie-Tableaux&quot; (aka Suite No. 1, Op. 5) and &quot;Morceaux de salon&quot; (Op. 10). In September, he published Six Songs (Op. 8), a group of songs set to translations by Aleksey Pleshcheyev of Ukrainian and German poems. Rachmaninoff returned to Moscow, where Tchaikovsky agreed to conduct &quot;The Rock&quot; for an upcoming European tour. During his subsequent trip to Kyiv to conduct performances of &quot;Aleko&quot;, he learned of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death from cholera. The news left Rachmaninoff stunned; later that day, he started work on his &quot;Trio élégiaque&quot; for piano, violin and cello as a tribute, which he completed within a month. The music&#x27;s aura of gloom reveals the depth and sincerity of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s grief for his idol. The piece debuted at the first concert devoted to Rachmaninoff&#x27;s compositions on 31 January 1894.

=== 1894–1900: Symphony No. 1, depression, and conducting debut ===
Rachmaninoff entered a decline following Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death. He lacked the inspiration to compose, and the management of the Grand Theatre had lost interest in showcasing &quot;Aleko&quot; and dropped it from the program. To earn more money, Rachmaninoff returned to giving piano lessons—which he hated—and in late 1895, agreed to a three-month tour across Russia with a program shared by Italian violinist Teresina Tua. The tour was not enjoyable for the composer and he quit before it ended, thus sacrificing his performance fees. In a more desperate plea for money, Rachmaninoff pawned his gold watch given to him by Zverev. In September 1895, before the tour started, Rachmaninoff completed his Symphony No. 1 (Op. 13), a work conceived in January and based on chants he had heard in Russian Orthodox church services. Rachmaninoff had worked so hard on it that he could not return to composition until he heard the piece performed. This lasted until October 1896, when &quot;a rather large sum of money&quot; that did not belong to Rachmaninoff and was in his possession, was stolen during a train journey and he had to work to recoup the losses. Among the pieces composed were &quot;Six Choruses&quot; (Op. 15) and &quot;Six moments musicaux&quot; (Op. 16), his final completed composition for several months.

Rachmaninoff&#x27;s fortunes took a turn following the premiere of his Symphony No. 1 on 28 March 1897 in one of a long-running series of Russian Symphony Concerts devoted to Russian music. The piece was brutally panned by critic and nationalist composer César Cui, who likened it to a depiction of the seven plagues of Egypt, suggesting it would be admired by the &quot;inmates&quot; of a music conservatory in Hell. The deficiencies of the performance, conducted by Alexander Glazunov, were not commented on by other critics, but according to a memoir from Alexander Ossovsky, a close friend of Rachmaninoff, Glazunov made poor use of rehearsal time, and the concert&#x27;s program itself, which contained two other premières, was also a factor. Other witnesses, including Rachmaninoff&#x27;s wife, suggested that Glazunov, an alcoholic, may have been drunk. Following the reaction to his first symphony, Rachmaninoff wrote in May 1897 that &quot;I&#x27;m not at all affected&quot; by its lack of success or critical reaction, but felt &quot;deeply distressed and heavily depressed by the fact that my Symphony ... did not please &quot;me&quot; at all after its first rehearsal&quot;. He thought its performance was poor, particularly Glazunov&#x27;s contribution. The piece was not performed for the rest of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s life, but he revised it into a four-hand piano arrangement in 1898.

Rachmaninoff fell into a depression that lasted for three years, during which he had writer&#x27;s block and composed almost nothing. He described this time as &quot;Like the man who had suffered a stroke and for a long time had lost the use of his head and hands&quot;. He made a living by giving piano lessons. A stroke of good fortune came from Savva Mamontov, a Russian industrialist and founder of the Moscow Private Russian Opera, who offered Rachmaninoff the post of assistant conductor for the 1897–98 season. The cash-strapped composer accepted, conducting &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; by Camille Saint-Saëns as his first opera on 12 October 1897. By the end of February 1899, Rachmaninoff attempted composition and completed two short piano pieces, &quot;Morceau de Fantaisie&quot; and Fughetta in F major. Two months later, he travelled to London for the first time to perform and conduct, earning positive reviews. In late 1899, however, his depression worsened following an unproductive summer; he composed one song, &quot;Fate&quot;, which later became one of his Twelve Songs (Op. 21), and left compositions for a proposed return visit to London unfulfilled. In an attempt to revive his desire to compose, his aunt arranged for the writer Leo Tolstoy, whom Rachmaninoff greatly admired, to have the composer visit his home and receive words of encouragement. The visit was unsuccessful, doing nothing to help him compose with the fluency he had before.

=== 1900–1906: Recovery, emergence, and conducting ===
By 1900, Rachmaninoff had become so self-critical that, despite numerous attempts, composing had become near impossible. His aunt then suggested professional help, having received successful treatment from a family friend, physician and amateur musician Nikolai Dahl, to which Rachmaninoff agreed without resistance. Between January and April 1900, Rachmaninoff underwent hypnotherapy and supportive therapy sessions with Dahl on a daily basis, specifically structured to improve his sleep patterns, mood, and appetite and reignite his desire to compose. That summer, Rachmaninoff felt that &quot;new musical ideas began to stir&quot; and successfully resumed composition. His first fully completed work, the Piano Concerto, was finished in April 1901; it is dedicated to Dahl. After the second and third movement premiered in December 1900 with Rachmaninoff as the soloist, the entire piece was first performed in 1901 and was enthusiastically received. The piece earned the composer a Glinka Award, the first of five awarded to him throughout his life, and a 500-ruble prize in 1904.

Amid his professional career success, Rachmaninoff married Natalia Satina on 12 May 1902 after a three-year engagement. Because they were first cousins, the marriage was forbidden under a Canon law imposed by the Russian Orthodox Church; in addition, Rachmaninoff was not a regular church attendee and avoided confession, two things a priest would have had to confirm that he did in signing a marriage certificate. To circumvent the church&#x27;s opposition, the couple used their military background and organised a small ceremony in a chapel in a Moscow suburb army barracks with Siloti and the cellist Anatoliy Brandukov as best men. They received the smaller of two houses at the Ivanovka estate as a present and went on a three-month honeymoon across Europe. Upon their return, they settled in Moscow, where Rachmaninoff resumed work as a music teacher at St. Catherine&#x27;s Women&#x27;s College and the Elizabeth Institute. By February 1903 he had completed his largest piano composition of his career at the time, the &quot;Variations on a Theme of Chopin&quot; (Op. 22). On 14 May 1903, the couple&#x27;s first daughter, Irina Sergeyevna Rachmaninova, was born. During their summer break at Ivanovka, the family was struck with illness.

In 1904, in a career change, Rachmaninoff agreed to become the conductor at the Bolshoi Theatre for two seasons. He earned a mixed reputation during his time at the post, enforcing strict discipline and demanding high standards of performance. Influenced by Richard Wagner, he pioneered the modern arrangement of the orchestra players in the pit and the modern custom of standing while conducting. He also worked with each soloist on their part, even accompanying them on the piano. The theatre staged the premiere of his operas &quot;The Miserly Knight&quot; and &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot;.

In the course of his second season as conductor, Rachmaninoff lost interest in his post. The social and political unrest surrounding the 1905 Revolution was beginning to affect the performers and theatre staff, who staged protests and demands for improved wages and conditions. Rachmaninoff remained largely uninterested in the politics surrounding him and the revolutionary spirit had made working conditions increasingly difficult. In February 1906, after conducting 50 performances in the first season and 39 in the second, Rachmaninoff handed in his resignation. He then took his family on an extended tour around Italy with the hope of completing new works, but illness struck his wife and daughter, and they returned to Ivanovka. Money soon became an issue following Rachmaninoff&#x27;s resignation from his posts at St. Catherine&#x27;s and Elizabeth schools, leaving him only the option of composing.

=== 1906–1917: Move to Dresden and first US tour ===
Increasingly unhappy with the political turmoil in Russia and in need of seclusion from his lively social life to be able to compose, Rachmaninoff with his family left Moscow for Dresden, Germany, in November 1906. The city had become a favourite of both Rachmaninoff and Natalia, and they stayed there until 1909, only returning to Russia for their summer breaks at Ivanovka. In Paris, during the summer of 1907, he saw a black and white reproduction of &quot;The Isle of the Dead&quot; by Arnold Böcklin, which served as the inspiration for his orchestral work of the same name, Op. 29. Despite occasional periods of depression, apathy, and little faith in any of his work, Rachmaninoff started on his Symphony No. 2 (Op. 27) in 1906, twelve years after the disastrous premiere of his first. While writing it, Rachmaninoff and the family returned to Russia, but the composer detoured to Paris to take part in Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s season of Russian concerts in May 1907. His performance as the soloist in his Piano Concerto No. 2 with an encore of his Prelude in C-sharp minor was a triumphant success. Rachmaninoff regained his sense of self-worth following the enthusiastic reaction to the premiere of his Symphony No. 2 in early 1908, which earned him his second Glinka Award and 1,000 roubles.

While in Dresden, Rachmaninoff agreed to perform and conduct in the United States as part of the 1909–10 concert season with conductor Max Fiedler and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He spent time during breaks at Ivanovka finishing a new piece specially for the visit, his Piano Concerto No. 3, Op. 30, which he dedicated to Josef Hofmann. The tour saw the composer make 26 performances, 19 as pianist and 7 as conductor, which marked his first recitals without another performer in the program. His first appearance was at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts for a recital on 4 November 1909. The second performance of Piano Concerto No. 3 by the New York Symphony Orchestra was conducted by Gustav Mahler in New York City with the composer as soloist, an experience he personally treasured. Though the tour increased the composer&#x27;s popularity in America, he declined subsequent offers due to the length of time away from Russia and his family.

Upon his return home in February 1910, Rachmaninoff became vice president of the Imperial Russian Musical Society (IRMS), whose president was a member of the royal family. Later in 1910, Rachmaninoff completed his choral work &quot;Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom&quot;, Op. 31, but it was banned from performance as it did not follow the format of a typical liturgical church service. For two seasons between 1911 and 1913, Rachmaninoff was appointed permanent conductor of the Philharmonic Society of Moscow; he helped raise its profile and increase audience numbers and receipts. In 1912, Rachmaninoff left the IRMS when he learned that a musician in an administrative post was dismissed for being Jewish.

Soon after his resignation, an exhausted Rachmaninoff sought time for composition and took his family on holiday to Switzerland. They left after one month for Rome for a visit that became a particularly tranquil and influential period for the composer, who lived alone in a small apartment on Piazza di Spagna while his family stayed at a boardinghouse. While there he received an anonymous letter that contained a Russian translation of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;The Bells&quot; by Konstantin Balmont, which affected him greatly, and he began work on his choral symphony of the same title, Op. 35, based on it. By 1912, Rachmninoff&#x27;s second daughter Tatiana was born, and his contemporaneous period of composition ended abruptly when both Rachmaninoff&#x27;s daughters contracted serious cases of typhoid and were treated in Berlin due to their father&#x27;s greater trust in German doctors. After six weeks, the Rachmaninoffs returned to their Moscow flat. The composer conducted &quot;The Bells&quot; at its premiere in Saint Petersburg in late 1913.

In January 1914, Rachmaninoff began a concert tour of England which was enthusiastically received. He was too afraid to travel alone following the death of Raoul Pugno of an unexpected heart attack in his hotel room which left the composer wary of a similar fate. Following the outbreak of the First World War later that year, his position of Inspector of Music at Nobility High School for Girls put him in the group of government servants which prevented him from joining the army, yet the composer made regular charitable donations for the war effort. In 1915, Rachmaninoff completed his second major choral work, &quot;All-Night Vigil&quot; (Op. 37). It was received so warmly at its Moscow premiere in aid of war relief that four subsequent performances were quickly scheduled.

Alexander Scriabin&#x27;s death in April 1915 was a tragedy for Rachmaninoff, who went on a piano recital tour devoted to his friend&#x27;s compositions to raise funds for Scriabin&#x27;s financially stricken widow. It marked his first public performances of works other than his own. During a vacation in Finland that summer, Rachmaninoff learned of Taneyev&#x27;s death, a loss which affected him greatly. By year&#x27;s end he had finished his &quot;14 Romances&quot;, Op. 34, whose final section, &quot;Vocalise&quot;, became one of his most popular pieces.

=== 1917–1925: Leaving Russia, emigration to the US, and concert pianist ===
On the day the February 1917 Revolution began in Saint Petersburg, Rachmaninoff performed a piano recital in Moscow in aid of wounded Russian soldiers who had fought in the war. He returned to Ivanovka two months later, finding it in chaos after a group of Social Revolutionary Party members seized it as their own communal property. Despite having invested most of his earnings on the estate, Rachmaninoff left the property after three weeks, vowing never to return. It was soon confiscated by the communist authorities and became derelict. In June 1917, Rachmaninoff asked Siloti to produce visas for him and his family so they could leave Russia, but Siloti was unable to help. After a break with his family in the more peaceful Crimea, Rachmaninoff&#x27;s concert performance in Yalta on 5 September 1917 was to be his last in Russia. Upon returning to Moscow, the political tension surrounding the October Revolution found the composer keeping his family safe indoors and being involved in a collective at his apartment building where he attended committee meetings and kept guard at night. He completed revisions to his Piano Concerto No. 1 among gunshots and rallies outside.
Amidst such turmoil, Rachmaninoff received an unexpected offer to perform ten piano recitals across Scandinavia, which he immediately accepted, using it as an excuse to obtain permits so he and his family could leave the country. On 22 December 1917, they left Saint Petersburg by train to the Finnish border, from where they travelled through Finland on an open sled and train to Helsinki. Carrying what they could pack into their small suitcases, Rachmaninoff brought some sketches of compositions and scores to the first act of his unfinished opera &quot;Monna Vanna&quot; and Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s opera &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot;. They arrived in Stockholm, Sweden, on 24 December. In January 1918, they relocated to Copenhagen, Denmark, and, with the help of friend and composer (1875–1920), settled on the ground floor of a house. In debt and in need of money, the 44-year-old Rachmaninoff chose performing as his main source of income, as a career solely in composition was too restrictive. His piano repertoire was small, which prompted the start of regular practice of his technique and learning new pieces to play. Rachmaninoff toured between February and October 1918.

During the Scandinavian tour, Rachmaninoff received three offers from the US: to become the conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra for two years, to conduct 110 concerts in 30 weeks for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and to give 25 piano recitals. He was worried about such a commitment in an unfamiliar country and had few good memories from his debut tour in 1909, so he declined all three. Not long after his decision, Rachmaninoff considered the United States financially advantageous as he could not support his family through composition alone. Unable to afford the travel fees, he was sent an advance loan for the journey by Russian banker and fellow emigre Alexander Kamenka. Money was also received from friends and admirers; pianist Ignaz Friedman contributed $2,000. On 1 November 1918, the Rachmaninoffs boarded the SS &quot;Bergensfjord&quot; in Oslo, Norway, bound for New York City, arriving eleven days later. News of the composer&#x27;s arrival spread, causing a crowd of musicians, artists, and fans to gather outside The Sherry-Netherland hotel, where he was staying.

Rachmaninoff quickly dealt with business, hiring pianist Dagmar de Corval Rybner as his secretary, interpreter, and aide in dealing with American life. He reunited with Josef Hofmann, who informed several concert managers that the composer was available and suggested he choose Charles Ellis as his booking agent. Ellis organised 36 performances for Rachmaninoff for the upcoming 1918–1919 concert season; the first, a piano recital, took place on 8 December at Providence, Rhode Island. Rachmaninoff, still in recovery from a case of the Spanish flu, included his arrangement of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; in the program. Before the tour he had received offers from numerous piano manufacturers to tour with their instruments; he chose Steinway, the only one that did not offer him money. Steinway&#x27;s association with Rachmaninoff continued for the rest of his life.

After the first tour ended in April 1919, Rachmaninoff took his family on a break to San Francisco. He recuperated and prepared for the upcoming season, a cycle that he would adopt for most of his remaining life. As a touring performer Rachmaninoff became financially secure without much difficulty, and the family lived an upper middle class life with servants, a chef, and chauffeur. They recreated the atmosphere of Ivanovka in their New York City apartment by entertaining Russian guests, employing Russians, and continuing to observe Russian customs. Despite the ability to speak some English, Rachmaninoff had his correspondence translated into Russian. He enjoyed some personal luxuries, including quality tailored suits and the latest models of cars.

In 1920, Rachmaninoff signed a recording contract with the Victor Talking Machine Company which earned him some much needed income and began his longtime association with RCA. During a family holiday in Goshen, New York, that summer he learned of Struve&#x27;s accidental death, prompting Rachmaninoff to strengthen the ties he had with those still in Russia by arranging with his bank to send regular money and food parcels to his family, friends, students, and those in need. Early 1921 saw Rachmaninoff apply for documentation to visit Russia, the only time he would do so after leaving the country, but progress ceased when he underwent surgery for pain in his right temple. The operation failed to relieve his symptoms and relief only came after having dental work years later. After leaving hospital, he purchased an apartment on 33 Riverside Drive on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, overlooking the Hudson River.

Rachmaninoff&#x27;s first visit to Europe since emigrating occurred in May 1922, with concerts in London. This was followed by the Rachmaninoffs and the Satins reuniting in Dresden, after which the composer prepared for a hectic 1922–1923 concert season of 71 performances in five months. For a while, he rented a railway carriage that was fitted with a piano and belongings to save time with suitcases. In 1924, Rachmaninoff declined an invitation to become conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In the following year, after the death of the husband of his daughter Irina who was with child at that time (later the grand-daughter would be named Sophie Volkonsky), Rachmaninoff founded TAIR (Tatiana and Irina), a Paris publishing company named after his daughters that specialised in works by himself and other Russian composers.

=== 1926–1942: Touring, final compositions, and Villa Senar ===
Rachmaninoff&#x27;s life as a touring performer, and the demanding schedules that came with it, caused his compositional output to slow significantly. In the 24 years between his arrival in the US and his death, he completed just six new pieces, revised some of his earlier works, and wrote piano transcriptions for his live repertoire. He admitted that by leaving Russia, &quot;I left behind my desire to compose: losing my country, I lost myself also&quot;. In 1926, having concentrated on touring for the past eight years, he took a year off and completed the Piano Concerto No. 4, which he had started in 1917, and &quot;Three Russian Songs&quot;, which he dedicated to Leopold Stokowski.

Rachmaninoff sought the company of fellow Russian musicians and befriended pianist Vladimir Horowitz in 1928. The men remained supportive of each other&#x27;s work, each making a point of attending concerts given by the other, and Horowitz remained a champion of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s works and in particular his Piano Concerto No. 3. In 1930, in a rare occurrence, Rachmaninoff allowed Italian composer Ottorino Respighi to orchestrate pieces from his &quot;Études-Tableaux&quot;, Op. 33 (1911) and the &quot;Études-Tableaux&quot;, Op. 39 (1917), giving Respighi the inspirations behind the compositions. By December 1931, his daughter was engaged to marry Boris Conus, with a second grandchild Alexander Conus born later to the couple. In 1931, Rachmaninoff and several others signed an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that criticised the cultural policies of the Soviet Union. The composer&#x27;s music suffered a boycott in the Soviet Union as a result from the backlash in the Soviet press, lasting until 1933.
From 1929 to 1931, Rachmaninoff spent his summers in France at Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines near Rambouillet, meeting with fellow Russian émigrés and his daughters. By 1930, his desire to compose had returned and he sought a new location to write new pieces. He bought a plot of land near Hertenstein on the banks of Lake Lucerne, Switzerland, and oversaw the construction of his home which he named Villa Senar after the first two letters of his and his wife&#x27;s name, adding the &quot;r&quot; from the family name. Rachmaninoff spent his summers at Villa Senar until 1939, often with his daughters and grandchildren, with whom he would drive his motorboat on Lake Lucerne, one of his favourite activities. In the comfort of his own home, Rachmaninoff completed &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot; in 1934 and the Symphony in 1936.

In October 1932, Rachmaninoff began a demanding concert season that consisted of 50 performances. The tour marked the fortieth anniversary of his debut as a pianist, for which several of his Russian friends now living in America sent him a scroll and wreath in celebration. The frail economic situation in the US resulted in the composer performing to smaller audiences, and he lost money in his investments and shares. The European leg of this tour in 1933 saw Rachmaninoff celebrate his sixtieth birthday among fellow musicians and friends, after which he retreated to Villa Senar for the summer. In May 1934, Rachmaninoff underwent a minor operation and two years later, he retreated to Aix-les-Bains in France to improve his arthritis. During a visit to Villa Senar in 1937, Rachmaninoff entered talks with choreographer Michel Fokine about a ballet based on Niccolò Paganini that was to feature his rhapsody. It premiered in London in 1939 with the composer&#x27;s daughters in attendance. In 1938, Rachmaninoff performed his Piano Concerto No. 2 at a charity jubilee concert at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall to celebrate Henry Wood, founder of the Promenade concerts and an admirer of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s who wanted him to be the show&#x27;s only soloist. Rachmaninoff agreed, so long as the performance was not broadcast on the radio due to his aversion to the medium.

The 1939–40 concert season saw Rachmaninoff perform fewer concerts than usual, totalling 43 appearances that were mostly in the US. The tour continued with dates across England, after which Rachmaninoff visited his daughter Tatyana in Paris followed by a return to Villa Senar. He was unable to perform for a while after slipping on the floor at the villa and injuring himself. He recovered enough to perform at the Lucerne International Music Festival on 11 August 1939. It was to be his final concert in Europe. With World War II imminent, he returned to Paris two days later, where he, his wife, and two daughters were together for the last time before the composer left Europe on 23 August. With financial help from Rachmaninoff, philosopher Ivan Ilyin was able to pay the bail and settle in Switzerland. Rachmaninoff would support the Soviet Union&#x27;s war effort against Nazi Germany from mid-1941 onwards, donating receipts from many of his concerts for the benefit of the Red Army.

Upon his return to the US, Rachmaninoff performed with the Philadelphia Orchestra in New York City with conductor Eugene Ormandy on 26 November and 3 December 1939, as part of the orchestra&#x27;s special series of concerts dedicated to the composer in celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of his US debut. The final concert on 10 December saw Rachmaninoff conduct his Symphony No. 3 and &quot;The Bells&quot;, marking his first conducting performance since 1917. The concert season left Rachmaninoff tired, and he spent the summer resting from minor surgery at Orchard&#x27;s Point, an estate near Huntington, New York on Long Island. During this period Rachmaninoff completed his final composition, the &quot;Symphonic Dances&quot;, Op. 45, which was premiered by Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra in January 1941, with Rachmaninoff in attendance. In December 1939, Rachmaninoff began an extensive recording period which lasted until February 1942 and included his Piano Concerto Nos. 1 and 3 and Symphony No. 3 at the Philadelphia Academy of Music.

=== 1942–1943: Illness, move to California, and death ===

In early 1942, Rachmaninoff was advised by his doctor to relocate to a warmer climate to improve his health after suffering from sclerosis, lumbago, neuralgia, high blood pressure, and headaches. After completing his final studio recording sessions during this time in February, a move to Long Island fell through after the composer and his wife expressed a greater interest in California, and initially settled in a leased home on Tower Road in Beverly Hills in May. In June they purchased a home at 610 North Elm Drive in Beverly Hills, living close to Horowitz who would often visit and perform piano duets with Rachmaninoff. Later in 1942, Rachmaninoff invited Igor Stravinsky to dinner, the two sharing their worries of a war-torn Russia and their children in France.

Shortly after a performance at the Hollywood Bowl in July 1942, Rachmaninoff was suffering from lumbago and fatigue. He informed his doctor, Alexander Golitsyn, that the upcoming 1942–43 concert season would be his last, in order to dedicate his time to composition. The tour began on 12 October 1942 and the composer received many positive reviews from critics despite his deteriorating health. Rachmaninoff and his wife Natalia were among the 220 people who became naturalised American citizens at a ceremony held in New York City on 1 February 1943. Later that month he complained of persistent cough and back pain; a doctor diagnosed him with pleurisy and advised that a warmer climate would aid in his recovery. Rachmaninoff opted to continue with touring, but felt so ill during his travels to Florida that the remaining dates were cancelled and he returned to California by train, where an ambulance took him to hospital. It was then that Rachmaninoff was diagnosed with an aggressive form of melanoma. His wife took Rachmaninoff home where he reunited with his daughter Irina. His last appearances as a concerto soloist, playing Beethoven&#x27;s First Piano Concerto and his &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot;, were on 11 and 12 February with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Hans Lange, and on 17 February, at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee, he gave his last recital as a pianist.

Rachmaninoff&#x27;s health rapidly declined in the last week of March 1943. He lost his appetite, had constant pain in his arms and sides, and found it increasingly difficult to breathe. On 26 March, the composer lost consciousness and he died two days later at his home in Beverly Hills, at age 69. A message from several Moscow composers with greetings had arrived too late for Rachmaninoff to read it. His funeral took place at the Holy Virgin Mary Russian Orthodox Church on Micheltorena Street in Silver Lake. In his will, Rachmaninoff wished to be buried at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, where Scriabin, Taneyev, and Chekhov were buried, but his American citizenship made that impossible. Instead, he was interred at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York.

After Rachmaninoff&#x27;s death, poet Marietta Shaginyan published fifteen letters they exchanged from their first contact in February 1912 and their final meeting in July 1917. The nature of their relationship bordered on romantic, but was primarily intellectual and emotional. Shaginyan and the poetry she shared with Rachmaninoff have been cited as the inspiration for his Six Songs, Op. 38.

== Music ==

=== Influences ===

A major influence on Rachmaninoff as a composer was Tchaikovsky. This influence can be seen throughout Rachmaninoff&#x27;s early compositions, such as in his Youth Symphony, which is reminiscent of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s late symphonies, sections of his symphonic poem &quot;Prince Rostislav&quot;, which emulates &quot;The Tempest&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and his youthful Three Nocturnes, the third of which contains a chordal section very similar to the opening of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s First Piano Concerto. His first opera, &quot;Aleko&quot; shows the influence of Tchaikovsky in both its harmonies, and in its allusions and references to &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. Tchaikovsky was also particularly influential on Rachmaninoff&#x27;s melodic writing, though musicologist Stephen Walsh describes Rachmaninoff&#x27;s melodies as lacking the range or length of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s.

The influence of Anton Arensky, who taught Rachmaninoff for five years while he was at the Moscow Conservatory, can be seen in the composer&#x27;s early compositions. This influence can be seen, for example, in his symphonic poem &quot;Prince Rostislav&quot;, dedicated to Arensky, and a number of compositions from his student years may have been written as exercises for his teacher. According to biographer Barrie Martyn, the &quot;obviously Russian character&quot; and &quot;Tchaikovskian lyricism&quot; of Arensky&#x27;s music were elements which were also part of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s compositional style. Sergei Taneyev, Rachmaninoff&#x27;s teacher in counterpoint at the Moscow Conservatory, was also an influence on his early compositions, and Rachmaninoff would bring his compositions to Taneyev to gain his approval all the way up to 1915, the year in which Taneyev died. In his later style, the influence of Rimsky-Korsakov can be seen in the increasingly chromatic harmonies and thinner orchestration in Rachmaninoff&#x27;s compositions from his Third Piano Concerto onwards.

=== Works ===

Rachmaninoff wrote five works for piano and orchestra: four concertos—in F-sharp minor, Op. 1 (1891, revised 1917), in C minor, Op. 18 (1900–01), in D minor, Op. 30 (1909), and in G minor, Op. 40 (1926, revised 1928 and 1941)—and the &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot;. Of the concertos, the Second and Third are the most popular.

Rachmaninoff also composed a number of works for orchestra alone. The three symphonies: in D minor, Op. 13 (1895), in E minor, Op. 27 (1907), and in A minor, Op. 44 (1935–36). Widely spaced chronologically, the symphonies represent three distinct phases in his compositional development. The Second has been the most popular of the three since its first performance. Among Rachmaninoff&#x27;s other orchestral works are his &quot;Symphonic Dances&quot; (Op. 45), his last major composition, and his four symphonic poems: &quot;Prince Rostislav&quot;, &quot;The Rock&quot; (Op. 7), &quot;Caprice bohémien&quot; (Op. 12), and &quot;The Isle of the Dead&quot; (Op. 29).

As Rachmaninoff was a skilled pianist, a large portion of his compositional output consists of works for solo piano. They include 24 Preludes traversing all 24 major and minor keys; Prelude in C-sharp minor (Op. 3, ) from &quot;Morceaux de fantaisie&quot; (Op. 3); ten preludes in Op. 23; and thirteen in Op. 32. Especially difficult are the two sets of &quot;Études-Tableaux&quot;, Op. 33 and 39, which are very demanding &quot;study pictures&quot;. Stylistically, Op. 33 hearkens back to the preludes, while Op. 39 shows the influences of Scriabin and Prokofiev. There are also the &quot;Six moments musicaux&quot; (Op. 16), the &quot;Variations on a Theme of Chopin&quot; (Op. 22), and the &quot;Variations on a Theme of Corelli&quot; (Op. 42). He wrote two piano sonatas, both of which are large scale and virtuosic in their technical demands. Rachmaninoff also composed works for two pianos, four hands, including two Suites (the first subtitled &quot;Fantasie-Tableaux&quot;), a version of the &quot;Symphonic Dances&quot; (Op. 45), and an arrangement of the C-sharp minor Prelude, as well as a &quot;Russian Rhapsody&quot;, and he arranged his First Symphony (below) for piano four hands. Both these works were published posthumously.

Rachmaninoff wrote two major a cappella choral works—the &quot;Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom&quot; and the &quot;All-Night Vigil&quot; (also known as the &quot;Vespers&quot;). It was the fifth movement of &quot;All-Night Vigil&quot; that Rachmaninoff requested to have sung at his funeral. Other choral works include a choral symphony, &quot;The Bells&quot;; the cantata &quot;Spring&quot;; the &quot;Three Russian Songs&quot;; and an early &quot;Concerto for Choir&quot; (a cappella).

He completed three one-act operas: &quot;Aleko&quot; (1892), &quot;The Miserly Knight&quot; (1903), and &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot; (1904). He started three others, notably &quot;Monna Vanna&quot;, based on the work by Maurice Maeterlinck; copyright in this had been extended to the composer Février, and, though the restriction did not pertain to Russia, Rachmaninoff dropped the project after completing Act I in piano vocal score in 1908. &quot;Aleko&quot; is regularly performed and has been recorded complete at least eight times, and filmed. &quot;The Miserly Knight&quot; adheres to Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;little tragedy&quot;. &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot; was described by the composer as a &quot;symphonic opera&quot; because of its long interludes.

Rachmaninoff, similarly to many Russian composers of his time, wrote relatively little chamber music. His output in the genre includes two piano trios, both of which are named &quot;Trio Elégiaque&quot; (the second of which is a memorial tribute to Tchaikovsky), a Cello Sonata, and the &quot;Morceaux de salon&quot; for violin and piano.

Rachmaninoff composed a total of 83 songs (&quot;románsy&quot; in Russian) for voice and piano, all of which were written before he left Russia permanently in 1917. Most of his songs were set to texts by Russian romantic writers and poets, such as Alexander Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov, Afanasy Fet, Anton Chekhov and Aleksey Tolstoy, among others. His most popular song is the wordless &quot;Vocalise&quot;, which he later arranged for orchestra.

=== Compositional style ===
Rachmaninoff&#x27;s style was initially influenced by Tchaikovsky. By the mid-1890s, however, his compositions began showing a more individual tone. His First Symphony has many original features. Its brutal gestures and uncompromising power of expression were unprecedented in Russian music at the time. Its flexible rhythms, sweeping lyricism, and stringent economy of thematic material were all features he kept and refined in subsequent works. Following the poor reception of the symphony and three years of inactivity, Rachmaninoff&#x27;s individual style developed significantly. He started leaning towards broadly lyrical, often passionate melodies. His orchestration became subtler and more varied, with textures carefully contrasted. Overall, his writing became more concise.

Especially important is Rachmaninoff&#x27;s use of unusually widely spaced chords for bell-like sounds: this occurs in many pieces, most notably in the choral symphony &quot;The Bells&quot;, the Second Piano Concerto, the E-flat major &quot;Étude-Tableaux&quot; (Op. 33, ), and the B minor Prelude (Op. 32, ). &quot;It is not enough to say that the church bells of Novgorod, St Petersburg and Moscow influenced Rachmaninov and feature prominently in his music. This much is self-evident. What is extraordinary is the variety of bell sounds and breadth of structural and other functions they fulfill.&quot; He was also fond of Russian Orthodox chants. He used them most perceptibly in his &quot;Vespers&quot;, but many of his melodies found their origins in these chants. The opening melody of the First Symphony is derived from chants. (The opening melody of the Third Piano Concerto, on the other hand, is not derived from chants; when asked, Rachmaninoff said that &quot;it had [written] itself&quot;.)

Rachmaninoff&#x27;s frequently used motifs include the &quot;Dies irae&quot;, often just the fragments of the first phrase. Rachmaninoff had great command of counterpoint and fugal writing, thanks to his studies with Taneyev. The above-mentioned occurrence of the &quot;Dies irae&quot; in the Second Symphony (1907) is but a small example of this. Very characteristic of his writing is chromatic counterpoint. This talent was paired with a confidence in writing in both large- and small-scale forms. The Third Piano Concerto especially shows a structural ingenuity, while each of the preludes grows from a tiny melodic or rhythmic fragment into a taut, powerfully evocative miniature, crystallizing a particular mood or sentiment while employing a complexity of texture, rhythmic flexibility and a pungent chromatic harmony.

His compositional style had already begun changing before the October Revolution deprived him of his homeland. The harmonic writing in &quot;The Bells&quot; was composed in 1913 but not published until 1920. This may have been due to Rachmaninoff&#x27;s main publisher, Gutheil, having died in 1914 and Gutheil&#x27;s catalog being acquired by Serge Koussevitsky. It became as advanced as in any of the works Rachmaninoff would write in Russia, partly because the melodic material has a harmonic aspect which arises from its chromatic ornamentation. Further changes are apparent in the revised First Piano Concerto, which he finished just before leaving Russia, as well as in the Op. 38 songs and Op. 39 Études-Tableaux. In both these sets Rachmaninoff was less concerned with pure melody than with coloring. His near-Impressionist style perfectly matched the texts by symbolist poets. The Op. 39 Études-Tableaux are among the most demanding pieces he wrote for any medium, both technically and in the sense that the player must see beyond any technical challenges to a considerable array of emotions, then unify all these aspects.

The composer&#x27;s friend Vladimir Wilshaw noticed this compositional change continuing in the early 1930s, with a difference between the sometimes very extroverted Op. 39 Études-Tableaux (the composer had broken a string on the piano at one performance) and the &quot;Variations on a Theme of Corelli&quot; (Op. 42, 1931). The variations show an even greater textural clarity than in the Op. 38 songs, combined with a more abrasive use of chromatic harmony and a new rhythmic incisiveness. This would be characteristic of all his later works—the Piano Concerto (Op. 40, 1926) is composed in a more emotionally introverted style, with a greater clarity of texture. Nevertheless, some of his most beautiful (nostalgic and melancholy) melodies occur in the Third Symphony, &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot;, and &quot;Symphonic Dances&quot;.

Music theorist and musicologist Joseph Yasser, as early as 1951, uncovered progressive tendencies in Rachmaninoff&#x27;s compositions. He uncovered Rachmaninoff&#x27;s use of an intra-tonal chromaticism that stands in notable contrast to the inter-tonal chromaticism of Richard Wagner and strikingly contrasts the extra-tonal chromaticism of the more radical twentieth century composers like Arnold Schoenberg. Yasser postulated that a variable, subtle, but unmistakable characteristic use of this intra-tonal chromaticism permeated Rachmaninoff&#x27;s music.

=== Reputation and legacy ===

Rachmaninoff&#x27;s reputation as a composer generated a variety of opinions before his music gained steady recognition around the world. The 1954 edition of the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; notoriously dismissed Rachmaninoff&#x27;s music as &quot;monotonous in texture ... consist[ing] mainly of artificial and gushing tunes&quot; and predicted that his popular success was &quot;not likely to last&quot;. To this, Harold C. Schonberg, in his &quot;Lives of the Great Composers&quot;, responded: &quot;It is one of the most outrageously snobbish and even stupid statements ever to be found in a work that is supposed to be an objective reference.&quot;

The Conservatoire Rachmaninoff in Paris, as well as streets in Veliky Novgorod (which is close to his birthplace) and Tambov, are named after the composer. In 1986, the Moscow Conservatory dedicated a concert hall on its premises to Rachmaninoff, designating the 252-seat auditorium Rachmaninoff Hall, and in 1999 the &quot;Monument to Sergei Rachmaninoff&quot; was installed in Moscow. A separate monument to Rachmaninoff was unveiled in Veliky Novgorod, near his birthplace, on 14 June 2009. The 2015 musical &quot;Preludes&quot; by Dave Malloy depicts Rachmaninoff&#x27;s struggle with depression and writer&#x27;s block.

A statue marked &quot;Rachmaninoff: The Last Concert&quot;, designed and sculpted by Victor Bokarev, stands at the World&#x27;s Fair Park in Knoxville, Tennessee, as a tribute to the composer. In Alexandria, Virginia in 2019, a Rachmaninoff concert performed by the Alexandria Symphony Orchestra played to wide acclaim. Attendees were treated to a talk prior to the performance by Rachmaninoff&#x27;s great-granddaughter, Natalie Wanamaker Javier, who joined Rachmaninoff scholar Francis Crociata and Library of Congress music specialist Kate Rivers on a panel of discussants about the composer and his contributions.

== Pianist ==
Rachmaninoff ranked among the finest pianists of his time, along with Leopold Godowsky, Ignaz Friedman, Moriz Rosenthal, Josef Lhévinne, Ferruccio Busoni, and Josef Hofmann, and he was famed for possessing a clean and virtuosic technique. His playing was marked by precision, rhythmic drive, notable use of staccato and the ability to maintain clarity when playing works with complex textures. Rachmaninoff applied these qualities in music by Chopin, including the B-flat minor Piano Sonata. Rachmaninoff&#x27;s repertoire, excepting his own works, consisted mainly of standard 19th century virtuoso works plus music by Bach, Beethoven, Borodin, Debussy, Grieg, Liszt, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Schubert, Schumann and Tchaikovsky.

The two pieces Rachmaninoff singled out for praise from Anton Rubinstein&#x27;s concerts became cornerstones for his own recital programs. The compositions were Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Appassionata&quot; and Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Funeral March&quot; Sonata. He may have based his interpretation of the Chopin sonata on that of Rubinstein. Rachmaninoff biographer Barrie Martyn points out similarities between written accounts of Rubinstein&#x27;s interpretation and Rachmaninoff&#x27;s audio recording of the work.

=== Technique ===

Rachmaninoff possessed large hands, with which he could easily maneuver through the most complex chordal configurations. His left hand technique was unusually powerful. His playing was marked by &quot;definition&quot;—where other pianists&#x27; playing became blurry-sounding from overuse of the pedal or deficiencies in finger technique, Rachmaninoff&#x27;s textures were always crystal clear. Only Josef Hofmann and Josef Lhévinne shared this kind of clarity with him. All three men had Anton Rubinstein as a model for this kind of playing—Hofmann as a student of Rubinstein&#x27;s, Rachmaninoff from hearing his famous series of historical recitals in Moscow while studying with Zverev, and Lhévinne from hearing and playing with him.

=== Tone ===

Of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s tone, Arthur Rubinstein wrote:

I was always under the spell of his glorious and inimitable tone which could make me forget my uneasiness about his too rapidly fleeting fingers and his exaggerated &quot;rubatos&quot;. There was always the irresistible sensuous charm, not unlike Kreisler&#x27;s.

Coupled to this tone was a vocal quality not unlike that attributed to Chopin&#x27;s playing. With Rachmaninoff&#x27;s extensive operatic experience, he was a great admirer of fine singing. As his records demonstrate, he possessed a tremendous ability to make a musical line sing, no matter how long the notes or how complex the supporting texture, with most of his interpretations taking on a narrative quality. With the stories he told at the keyboard came multiple voices—a polyphonic dialogue, not the least in terms of dynamics. His 1940 recording of his transcription of the song &quot;Daisies&quot; captures this quality extremely well. On the recording, separate musical strands enter as if from various human voices in eloquent conversation. This ability came from an exceptional independence of fingers and hands.

=== Interpretations ===

Regardless of the music, Rachmaninoff always planned his performances carefully. He based his interpretations on the theory that each piece of music has a &quot;culminating point&quot;. Regardless of where that point was or at which dynamic within that piece, the performer had to know how to approach it with absolute calculation and precision; otherwise, the whole construction of the piece could crumble and the piece could become disjointed. This was a practice he learned from Russian bass Feodor Chaliapin, a staunch friend. Paradoxically, Rachmaninoff often sounded like he was improvising, though he actually was not. While his interpretations were mosaics of tiny details, when those mosaics came together in performance, they might, according to the tempo of the piece being played, fly past at great speed, giving the impression of instant thought.

One advantage Rachmaninoff had in this building process over most of his contemporaries was in approaching the pieces he played from the perspective of a composer rather than that of an interpreter. He believed &quot;interpretation demands something of the creative instinct. If you are a composer, you have an affinity with other composers. You can make contact with their imaginations, knowing something of their problems and their ideals. You can give their works &quot;color&quot;. That is the most important thing for me in my interpretations, &quot;color&quot;. So you make music live. Without color it is dead.&quot; Nevertheless, Rachmaninoff also possessed a far better sense of structure than many of his contemporaries, such as Hofmann, or the majority of pianists from the previous generation, judging from their respective recordings.

A recording which showcases Rachmaninoff&#x27;s approach is the Liszt Second Polonaise, recorded in 1925. Percy Grainger, who had been influenced by the composer and Liszt specialist Ferruccio Busoni, had himself recorded the same piece a few years earlier. Rachmaninoff&#x27;s performance is far more taut and concentrated than Grainger&#x27;s. The Russian&#x27;s drive and monumental conception bear a considerable difference to the Australian&#x27;s more delicate perceptions. Grainger&#x27;s textures are elaborate. Rachmaninoff shows the filigree as essential to the work&#x27;s structure, not simply decorative.

=== Hand size and medical speculations ===
Along with his musical gifts, Rachmaninoff possessed physical gifts that placed him in good stead as a pianist, including large hands with a gigantic finger stretch. Cyril Smith noted that Rachmaninoff could play a twelfth with the left hand playing C, Eb, G, C and G, and his right hand could play the notes C (index), E (thumb), G, C, and E.

His hand size, in addition to his considerable height, slender frame, long limbs, narrow head, prominent ears, and thin nose has led to the suggestion that he may have had Marfan syndrome, a hereditary disorder of the connective tissue. This syndrome would have accounted for several minor ailments he suffered all his life, including back pain, arthritis, eye strain, and bruising of the fingertips. An article in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine&quot;, however, pointed out that Rachmaninoff did not show many of the typical signs of Marfan syndrome, and instead suggested that he may have had acromegaly, which, the article speculated, would possibly have accounted for stiffness Rachmaninoff experienced in his hands, and for the repeated periods of depression he experienced throughout his life, and could have possibly even been connected to his melanoma.

=== Recordings ===
Upon arriving in America, Rachmaninoff&#x27;s poor financial situation prompted him in 1919 to record a selection of piano pieces for Edison Records on their &quot;Diamond Disc&quot; records, in a limited contract for ten released sides. Rachmaninoff felt his performances varied in quality and requested final approval prior to a commercial release. Edison agreed, but still issued multiple takes, an unusual practice which was standard at Edison Records. Rachmaninoff and Edison Records were pleased with the released discs and wished to record more, but Edison refused, saying the ten sides were sufficient. This, in addition to technical issues in the recordings and Edison&#x27;s lack of musical taste, led to Rachmaninoff&#x27;s annoyance with the company, and as soon as his contract ended he left Edison Records.

In 1920, Rachmaninoff signed a contract with the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor). Unlike Edison, the company was pleased to comply with his requests, and proudly advertised Rachmaninoff as one of their prominent recording artists. He continued to record for Victor until 1942, when the American Federation of Musicians imposed a recording ban on their members in a strike over royalty payments. Rachmaninoff died in March 1943, over a year and a half before RCA Victor settled with the union and resumed commercial recording activity.
When Rachmaninoff recorded his works, he would seek perfection, often re-recording them until he was satisfied. Particularly renowned are his renditions of Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Carnaval&quot; and Chopin&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 2, along with many shorter pieces. He recorded all four of his piano concertos with the Philadelphia Orchestra; the first, third, and fourth concertos were recorded with Eugene Ormandy in 1939–41, and two versions of the second concerto with Leopold Stokowski in 1924 and 1929. He also made a recording of the &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot;, soon after its first performance (1934) with the Philadelphians under Stokowski, in addition to three recordings he made as conductor with the Philadelphia Orchestra, playing his own Third Symphony, his symphonic poem &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot;, and his orchestration of &quot;Vocalise&quot;.

Rachmaninoff also recorded a number of piano rolls on the reproducing piano of the American Piano Company (Ampico), producing a total of 35 piano rolls from 1919 to 1929, 12 of which were of his own compositions. He began recording rolls for Ampico in March 1919, upon the suggestion of his friend Fritz Kreisler, and continued doing so, on and off, until around February 1929, though his last roll, of Chopin&#x27;s Scherzo No. 2, was not published until October 1933. Of the works he produced piano rolls for, 29 he also made gramophone recordings of, and these provide evidence for Rachmaninoff&#x27;s consistency of interpretation. In addition, there also survives an unpublished piano roll of the second movement of his Second Piano Concerto, and may be indicative of Rachmaninoff having made other rolls.

== Conductor ==

Apart from several performances, including two of his opera &quot;Aleko&quot; in 1893, Rachmaninoff first began conducting in 1897, and performed as a conductor every year until 1914. After leaving Russia permanently in 1917, Rachmaninoff prioritised performing as a pianist to conducting, giving only seven more recitals as a conductor until the end of his life.

Rachmaninoff was noted for his restraint in conducting, and for the &quot;simple and unpolished&quot; manner in which he gestured to the orchestra. According to Alexander Goldenweiser, his performances as a conductor were much stricter and less rhythmically free than his performances on the piano. In Nikolai Medtner&#x27;s estimation, he was &quot;the greatest Russian conductor&quot;.

In addition to his own works, Rachmaninoff conducted repertoire primarily from fellow Russian composers, such as Borodin, Glazunov, Glinka, Lyadov, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky, as well as other composers such as Grieg and Liszt. Outside of Russia, Rachmaninoff conducted almost exclusively his own works.

<doc id="99342" wikidata="Q3246444" url="?curid=99342" title="Weak entity">
<text>In a relational database, a weak entity is an entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its attributes alone; therefore, it must use a foreign key in conjunction with its attributes to create a primary key. The foreign key is typically a primary key of an entity it is related to.

The foreign key is an attribute of the identifying (or owner, parent, or dominant) entity set. Each element in the weak entity set must have a relationship with exactly one element in the owner entity set, and therefore, the relationship cannot be a many-to-many relationship.

Two entities can be associated without either being classified as weak, even if one depends on the other, as long as each has its own unique attribute. For instance, a &quot;person&quot; entity can be linked to a &quot;car&quot; without one of them being considered as weak entity.

In entity relationship diagrams (ER diagrams), a weak entity set is indicated by a bold (or double-lined) rectangle (the entity) connected by a bold (or double-lined) type arrow to a bold (or double-lined) diamond (the relationship). This type of relationship is called an &quot;identifying relationship&quot; and in IDEF1X notation it is represented by an oval entity rather than a square entity for base tables. An identifying relationship is one where the primary key is populated to the child weak entity as a primary key in that entity. 

In general (though not necessarily) a weak entity does not have any items in its primary key other than its inherited primary key and a sequence number. There are two types of weak entities: associative entities and subtype entities. The latter represents a crucial type of normalization, where the super-type entity inherits its attributes to subtype entities based on the value of the discriminator.

In IDEF1X, a government standard for capturing requirements, possible sub-type relationships are:
* &quot;Complete subtype relationship&quot;, when all categories are known.
* &quot;Incomplete subtype relationship&quot;, when all categories may not be known.

A classic example of a weak entity without a sub-type relationship would be the &quot;header/detail&#x27; records in many real world situations such as claims, orders and invoices, where the header captures information common across all forms and the detail captures information specific to individual items.

The standard example of a complete subtype relationship is the &quot;party&quot; entity. Given the discriminator PARTY TYPE (which could be individual, partnership, C Corporation, Sub Chapter S Association, Association, Governmental Unit, Quasi-governmental agency) the two subtype entities are PERSON, which contains individual-specific information such as first and last name and date of birth, and ORGANIZATION, which would contain such attributes as the legal name, and organizational hierarchies such as cost centers.

When sub-type relationships are rendered in a database, the super-type becomes what is referred to as a base table. The sub-types are considered derived tables, which correspond to weak entities. Referential integrity is enforced via cascading updates and deletes.

==Example==

Consider a database that records customer orders, where an order is for one or more of the items that the enterprise sells. The database would contain a table identifying customers by a customer number (primary key); another identifying the products that can be sold by a product number (primary key); and it would contain a pair of tables describing orders.

One of the tables could be called Orders and it would have an order number (primary key) to identify this order uniquely, and would contain a customer number (foreign key) to identify who the products are being sold to, plus other information such as the date and time when the order was placed, how it will be paid for, where it is to be shipped to, and so on.

The other table could be called ; it would be identified by a compound key consisting of both the order number (foreign key) and an item line number; with other non-primary key attributes such as the product number (foreign key) that was ordered, the quantity, the price, any discount, any special options, and so on. There may be zero, one or many entries corresponding to an Order entry, but no entry can exist unless the corresponding Order entry exists. (The zero case normally only applies transiently, when the order is first entered and before the first ordered item has been recorded.)

The table stores &quot;weak entities&quot; precisely because an has no meaning independent of the Order. Some might argue that an does have some meaning on its own; it records that at some time not identified by the record, somebody not identified by the record ordered a certain quantity of a certain product. This information might be of some use on its own, but it is of limited use. For example, as soon as you want to find seasonal or geographical trends in the sales of the item, you need information from the related Order record.

An order would not exist without a product and a person to create the order, so it could be argued that an order would be described as a weak entity and that products ordered would be a multivalue attribute of the order.

<doc id="99351" wikidata="Q281525" url="?curid=99351" title="Sidekick">
<text>A sidekick is a slang expression for a close companion or colleague who is, or is generally regarded as, subordinate to those whom they accompany.

==Origins==
The first recorded use of the term dates from 1896. It is believed to have originated in pickpocket slang of the late 19th century. The &quot;kick&quot; was the front pocket of a pair of trousers, believed to be the pocket safest from theft. Thus, by analogy, a &quot;side-kick&quot; was a person&#x27;s closest companion.

One of the earliest recorded examples of a sidekick may be Enkidu, who played a sidekick role to Gilgamesh after they became allies in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. Other early examples are Achilles and Patroclus in the &quot;Iliad&quot; and Moses and Aaron in the Old Testament.

==In fiction==
Sidekicks can fulfill one or multiple functions in fiction, such as a counterpoint to the hero, an alternate point of view, or knowledge, skills, or anything else the hero does not have. They often function as comic relief, and/or the straight man to the hero&#x27;s comedic actions. A sidekick can also be a character to whom the audience can more easily relate than the hero, or whom the audience can imagine themselves as being (such as teen sidekicks). And by asking questions of the hero, or giving the hero someone to talk to, the sidekick provides an opportunity for the author to provide exposition, thereby filling the same role as a Greek chorus.

Sidekicks frequently serve as an emotional connection, especially when the hero is depicted as detached and distant, traits which might make it difficult to like the hero. The sidekick is often the confidant who knows the main character better than anyone else, and gives a convincing reason to like the hero. Although Sherlock Holmes was portrayed as a difficult man to know, his friendship with Dr. Watson convinces the reader that Holmes is a good person. The Left Hand of Vampire Hunter D, being mentally linked to the reticent protagonist, often reveals thoughts, feelings, and the physical condition of his host, as well as background elements of the story.

The apparent stupidity of some comedy sidekicks is often used to make a non-intellectual hero look intelligent. Similarly, a flamboyant or effeminate sidekick may make an otherwise unimposing hero look more masculine. And a strong, silent and modest hero may have his fighting qualities revealed to the other characters and the audience by a talkative sidekick.

While many sidekicks are used for comic relief, there are other sidekicks who are less outrageous than the heroes they pledge themselves to, and comedy derived from the hero can often be amplified by the presence or reaction of the sidekick. Examples include Porky Pig, who is more sensible and calmer than Daffy Duck in later short films; similarly, Sancho Panza is more rational than Don Quixote.

It is typical for the character and sidekick to be of the same gender — otherwise the term &quot;sidekick&quot; is replaced with &quot;partner&quot; or &quot;companion&quot;. Whenever there is a team of more than two characters, the term sidekick is generally reserved for another team member of the same sex. It is rare for the relationship between a character and an opposite-sex sidekick to lack romantic or sexual overtones of any kind — though there are examples, like Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin, The original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series intentionally avoided any explicit onscreen indications of romantic or sexual attraction between The Doctor and his female companions. (See the discussion of comic books&#x27; teenage sidekicks below.)

While unusual, it is not unheard of for a sidekick to be more attractive, charismatic, or physically capable than the supposed hero. This is most typically encountered when the hero&#x27;s appeal is more intellectual rather than sexual. Such heroes (usually fictional sleuths and scientists) are often middle-aged or older and tend towards eccentricity. Such protagonists may, due to either age or physical unsuitability, be limited to cerebral conflicts, while leaving the physical action to a younger or more physically capable sidekick. This type of sidekick is rarely encountered in fiction, because the hero runs the risk of being upstaged by them. However, examples of successful such pairings include Detective Monk and his sidekick Sharona, Inspector Morse and his sidekick Detective Sergeant Robbie Lewis, Nero Wolfe and his sidekick Archie Goodwin, Hiro Nakamura and his sidekick Ando Masahashi, and Miles Vorkosigan and his sidekick cousin Ivan Vorpatril. In other media, The Green Hornet&#x27;s sidekick, Kato, has (especially since the 1960s television series with Bruce Lee) been depicted as a capable man of action, for instance in martial arts. The earliest Doctor Who serials, particularly during the First Doctor era, had young male companions who were capable of the physical action that the elderly William Hartnell was not. This became more important as Hartnell&#x27;s health declined during his tenure as The Doctor. This was not an issue with the following Doctors as they were cast with significantly younger actors.

It is also not unusual, especially in more recent TV programs such as &quot;Bones&quot; and &quot;NCIS&quot;, for there to be a &quot;team&quot; of sidekicks. In &quot;Bones&quot;, for example, FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth often fulfills one of the traditional roles of a sidekick by providing translations for the brilliant but socially incapable Dr. Temperance Brennan. Both Brennan and Booth, however, are heroes in their own right. The sidekicks in this case are the team of &quot;squints&quot; back in the Jeffersonian Institution&#x27;s Medico-Legal Lab, each with their own scientific specialty, all of whom are usually needed to break the case.

In certain cases, a sidekick can grow out of their role of second fiddle to the hero and become a hero in their own right. Dick Grayson is one such example, having outgrown the mantle of Robin when he was under Batman and taken up the new identity of Nightwing. Grayson for awhile succeeded his mentor and took on the costumed identity of Batman himself. Another example is the popular comic-strip soldier of fortune Captain Easy, who started as the two-fisted sidekick of the scrawny eponymous hero of the strip Wash Tubbs.

===Use===
Frodo Baggins&#x27;s Samwise Gamgee, and Harry Potter&#x27;s Ron Weasley, as well as the afore-mentioned Sancho Panza and Doctor Watson, are notable sidekicks from fiction.

In fiction, the term &quot;sidekick&quot; commonly refers to assistants to crime-fighting heroes. However, sidekicks do not necessarily accompany a crime-fighter, such as Leporello, Don Giovanni&#x27;s servant in the 1787 opera. Villains can also have sidekicks, who are usually portrayed as less brilliant or lacking cunning. The sidekick has the literary function of playing against the hero, often contrasting in skill, or performing functions not suited to the hero.

The sidekick was a regular presence in westerns, where Fuzzy Knight, Al &quot;Fuzzy&quot; St. John, Smiley Burnette, and Andy Devine had longer careers than some of the heroic singing cowboys for whom they took pratfalls.

In science fiction the sub-type of the alien sidekick has been established. Examples of alien sidekicks are Mr. Spock (sidekick of Captain James T. Kirk) on &quot;Star Trek&quot; and Chewbacca (sidekick of Han Solo) in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. One of the roles of the alien sidekick is to act as a mouthpiece for social commentary on the human condition from an outsider&#x27;s point of view.

Heroic sidekicks such as Streaky the Supercat of &quot;Krypto the Superdog&quot;, Festus Haggen of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;&#x27;s Matt Dillon, or Gabrielle of &quot;&quot; not only provide comic relief, but can occasionally be brave and/or resourceful and rescue the hero from a dire fate.
Kalimán, a heroic character depicted on movies, radio theatre and comic books, mentors a young lad named Solín.

===Comparisons===
A villain&#x27;s supporters are normally called henchmen, minions, or lackeys, not sidekicks. While this is partially a convention in terminology, it also reflects that few villains are capable of bonds of friendship and loyalty, which are normal in the relationship between a hero and sidekick. This may also be due to the different roles in fiction of the protagonist and the antagonist: whereas a sidekick is a relatively important character due to his or her proximity to the protagonist, and so will likely be a developed character, the role of a henchman is to act as cannon-fodder for the hero and &quot;his&quot; sidekick. As a result, henchmen tend to be anonymous, disposable characters, existing for the sole purpose of illustrating the protagonists&#x27; prowess as they defeat them.

Nevertheless, some villains do have sidekicks, including Lex Luthor&#x27;s Mercy Graves, the Joker&#x27;s Harley Quinn, Jigsaw&#x27;s Amanda, Shao Kahn&#x27;s Shang Tsung, Shinnok&#x27;s Quan Chi, Ben Wade&#x27;s Charlie Prince (from &quot;Three-Ten to Yuma&quot;), Light Yagami&#x27;s Misa Amane and Ryuk, Wario&#x27;s Waluigi, Dr. Eggman&#x27;s Orbot and Cubot, and Magneto&#x27;s Mystique (albeit only in the &quot;X-Men&quot; live action films).

===Examples===

Some well-known fictional sidekicks are Don Quixote&#x27;s Sancho Panza, Sherlock Holmes&#x27; Doctor Watson, The Lone Ranger&#x27;s Tonto, The Green Hornet&#x27;s Kato, Shrek&#x27;s Donkey and Puss in Boots, Aquaman&#x27;s Aqualad, Mickey Mouse&#x27;s Donald Duck and Goofy, Mario&#x27;s Luigi and Yoshi, Sonic&#x27;s Tails and Knuckles, Donkey Kong&#x27;s Diddy Kong, Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Daffy Duck and Porky Pig, Captain America&#x27;s Bucky, Batman&#x27;s Robin, and SpongeBob SquarePants&#x27;s Patrick Star.

==In television==
TV sidekicks usually play a supporting pivotal role to the star. Examples include Ethel Mertz to Lucy Ricardo (&quot;I Love Lucy&quot;), Ed Norton to Ralph Kramden (&quot;The Honeymooners&quot;), Screech Powers to Zack Morris (&quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;), Major Roger Healey to Major Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Nelson (&quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;), or even a group of people such as the Sweathogs to Mr. Kotter (&quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;). Duos of equal importance on TV such as Kate McArdle and Allie Lowell (&quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot;), Oscar Madison and Felix Unger (&quot;The Odd Couple&quot;), Bret Maverick and Bart Maverick (&quot;Maverick&quot;), or Laverne De Fazio and Shirley Feeney (&quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;), are sometimes both called sidekicks to each other, although the usual sense of the term denotes inequality.

Many television talk shows make use of a sidekick as a co-host who anchors a show with the main star. Ed McMahon played this role famously to Johnny Carson on the &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, as did Andy Richter to Conan O&#x27;Brien on the &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, and &quot;Conan&quot;. &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; employed a mechanical robot sidekick named Geoff Peterson (voiced by Josh Robert Thompson).

Clarence Gilyard informed viewers on a television commercial for &quot;Walker Texas Ranger&quot; that he was &quot;not&quot; Chuck Norris&#x27;s sidekick, instead humorously saying &quot;&quot;This&quot; is Chuck Norris&#x27;s sidekick&quot; over footage of Norris kicking a villain.

===Animation===

In animation, some popular examples are Boo-Boo Bear being Yogi Bear&#x27;s sidekick, Barney Rubble being Fred Flintstone&#x27;s sidekick, Waylon Smithers being the sidekick of Mr. Burns on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Baba Looey being the sidekick of Quick Draw McGraw, and Stimpy being the sidekick of Ren Höek on &quot;The Ren and Stimpy Show&quot;.

In the seventh episode of the 1994 animated series &quot;The Tick&quot;, the heroes take a night to relax at a local superhero nightclub. When they arrive, however, Arthur is promptly escorted to the Sidekick Lounge, a small shack behind the club, where he meets several other sidekicks who spend the night lamenting their second-fiddle lot in life.

==In video games==
Some video games have sidekicks who provide assistance to players during their adventures. An early example was Floyd in &quot;Planetfall&quot;, whom &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in April 1984 described as &quot;unique&quot;. A potential example of this is found in the case of the Mario Bros., with Luigi serving in a supporting role to his brother Mario. Sonic the Hedgehog is often accompanied by his sidekick Tails, and his would-be girlfriend Amy Rose also has a hero-sidekick relationship with Cream the Rabbit. Diddy Kong is often seen as the sidekick to Donkey Kong, while Mega Man is aided by his robotic dog Rush.

==In comic books==
Comic book sidekicks have a long and popular history, dating back to the beginnings of the form. Examples include the Crimson Avenger&#x27;s sidekick Wing, and Mister America&#x27;s sidekick Fatman, both of whom debuted in the late 1930s. Other notable comics sidekicks include Ebony White, Jughead, Etta Candy, Captain Haddock, and Obelix.

In 1940 DC Comics introduced comics&#x27; first teenage sidekick, Robin, created to soften the dark tone of the Batman comics and make the Dark Knight more attractive to younger readers. Robin&#x27;s instant popularity spawned a host of imitations, including such iconic characters as Bucky, Toro, Sandy the Golden Boy, and Speedy. Stripesy was the exception to the rule: an adult sidekick to a teen hero, the Star-Spangled Kid. Another unusual sidekick pairing was the Blonde Bomber (Honey Blake), a newsreel camerawoman, chemist, and crime-fighter with a male sidekick named Jimmy Slapso.

The prevalence of adult superheroes and their teenage &quot;wards&quot; caused some observers to look askance at the trend. Psychologist Fredric Wertham decided that the phenomenon was a landmine of hidden Freudian issues, and that a sidekick&#x27;s participation in violent encounters alongside his hero masked a sexual subtext. In 1954, Wertham&#x27;s book &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; coincided with congressional hearings on the negative influence of comic books, among other topics. For a time, superhero comics lost their popularity, and many teenage sidekicks faded into obscurity. Rick Veitch&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Brat Pack&quot;, and issues of Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;Top 10&quot;, address the seamy, exploitative, and potentially pedophilia-related aspects of the adult hero-teen sidekick relationship.

In the early 1960s, at the advent of the Silver Age, a new round of superhero sidekicks made their debuts, including Rick Jones, Aqualad, Snapper Carr, Kid Flash, and Wonder Girl. Marvel Comics mostly got around the teen sidekick quandary by creating a selection of super-powered teenagers — heroes in their own right, such as Spider-Man, the Human Torch, and the X-Men.

Most of the Golden Age and Silver Age sidekicks have evolved into independent heroes or been killed off. Certain heroes seem to attract serial sidekicks, notably Batman, Captain America, and The Flash. There have been at least five iterations of Robin; while Captain America has had a diverse array of sidekick successors to Bucky, including the Falcon, Demolition Man, Free Spirit, and Jack Flag.

<doc id="99352" wikidata="Q35735" url="?curid=99352" title="Gascon dialect">
<text>Gascon (; , ) is the vernacular Romance variety spoken mainly in the region of Gascony, France. It is often considered a variety of Occitan, although some authors consider it a different language.

Gascon is mostly spoken in Gascony and Béarn (Béarnese dialect) in southwestern France (in parts of the following French &quot;départements&quot;: Pyrénées-Atlantiques, Hautes-Pyrénées, Landes, Gers, Gironde, Lot-et-Garonne, Haute-Garonne, and Ariège) and in the Val d&#x27;Aran of Catalonia.

Aranese, a southern Gascon variety, is spoken in Catalonia alongside Catalan and Spanish. Most people in the region are trilingual in all three languages, causing some influence from Spanish and Catalan. Both these influences tend to differentiate it more and more from the dialects of Gascon spoken in France. Most linguists now consider Aranese a distinct dialect of Occitan and Gascon. Since the 2006 adoption of the new statute of Catalonia, Aranese is co-official with Catalan and Spanish in all of Catalonia (before, this status was valid for the Aran Valley only).

It was also one of the mother tongues of the English kings Richard the Lionheart and his younger brother John Lackland.

==Linguistic classification==

While many scholars accept that Occitan may constitute a single language, some authors reject this opinion and even the name &quot;Occitan&quot;: instead, they argue that the latter is a cover term for a family of distinct &quot;lengas d&#x27;òc&quot; rather than dialects of a single language. Gascon, in particular, is distinct enough linguistically to have been described as a language in its own right.

==Basque substrate==
The language spoken in Gascony before Roman rule was part of the Basque dialectal continuum (see Aquitanian language); the fact that the word &#x27;Gascon&#x27; comes from the Latin root &quot;vasco&quot;/&quot;vasconem&quot;, which is the same root that gives us &#x27;Basque&#x27;, implies that the speakers identified themselves at some point as Basque. There is a proven Basque substrate in the development of Gascon. This explains some of the major differences that exist between Gascon and other Occitan dialects. 

A typically Gascon feature that may arise from this substrate is the change from &quot;f&quot; to &quot;h&quot;. Where a word originally began with in Latin, such as &quot;festa&quot; &#x27;party/feast&#x27;, this sound was weakened to aspirated and then, in some areas, lost altogether; according to the substrate theory, this is due to the Basque dialects&#x27; lack of an equivalent phoneme, causing Gascon &quot;hèsta&quot; or . A similar change took place in Spanish. Thus, Latin &quot;facere&quot; gives Spanish &quot;hacer&quot; () (or, in some parts of southwestern Andalusia, ). Another phonological effect resulting from the Basque substrate may have been Gascon&#x27;s reluctance to pronounce a at the beginning of words, resolved by means of a prothetical vowel. 

Although some linguists deny the plausibility of the Basque substrate theory, it is widely assumed that Basque, the &quot;Circumpyrenean&quot; language (as put by Basque linguist Alfonso Irigoyen and defended by Koldo Mitxelena, 1982), is the underlying language spreading around the Pyrenees onto the banks of the Garonne River, maybe as far east as the Mediterranean in Roman times (&quot;niska&quot; cited by Joan Coromines as the name of each nymph taking care of the Roman spa &quot;Arles de Tech&quot; in Roussillon, etc.). Basque gradually eroded across Gascony in the High Middle Ages (Basques from the Val d&#x27;Aran cited still circa 1000), with vulgar Latin and Basque interacting and mingling, but eventually with the former replacing the latter north of the east and middle Pyrenees and developing into Gascon.

However, modern Basque has had lexical influence from Gascon in words like &quot;beira&quot; (&quot;glass&quot;), which is also seen in Galician-Portuguese. One way for the introduction of Gascon influence into Basque came about through language contact in bordering areas of the Northern Basque Country, acting as adstrate. The other one has taken place since the 11th century over the coastal fringe of Gipuzkoa extending from Hondarribia to San Sebastian, where Gascon was spoken up to the early 18th century and often used in formal documents until the 16th century, with evidence of its continued occurrence in Pasaia in the 1870s. A minor focus of influence was the Way of St James and the establishment of ethnic boroughs in several towns based on the privileges bestowed on the &quot;Francs&quot; by the Kingdom of Navarre from the 12th to the early 14th centuries, but the variant spoken and used in written records is mainly the Occitan of Toulouse.

The &quot;énonciatif&quot; (Occitan: &quot;enunciatiu&quot;) system of Gascon, a system that is more colloquial than characteristic of normative written Gascon and governs the use of certain preverbal particles (including the sometimes emphatic affirmative &quot;que&quot;, the occasionally mitigating or dubitative &quot;e&quot;, the exclamatory &quot;be&quot;, and the even more emphatic &quot;ja&quot;/&quot;ye&quot;, and the &quot;polite&quot; &quot;se&quot;) has also been attributed to the Basque substrate.

== Gascon varieties ==
Gascon is divided into three varieties or dialect sub-groups:
* Western Gascon, which includes Landese dialect and North-Gascon (bazadais, high-landese and bordelese)
* Eastern or interior Gascon, known as &quot;parlar clar&quot; (Béarnese)
* Pyrenean or southern Gascon, which includes Aranese dialect

The Jews of Gascony, who resided in Bordeaux, Bayonne and other cities, spoke until the beginning of the 20th century a sociolect of Gascon with special phonetic and lexical features, which linguistics named &quot;Judeo-Gascon&quot;. It has been superseded by a sociolect of French that retains most of the lexical features of this former variety.

Béarnais, the official language when Béarn was an independent state, does not correspond to a unified language: the three forms of Gascon are spoken in Béarn (in the south, Pyrenean Gascon, in the center and in the east, Eastern Gascon; to the north-west, Western Gascon).

==Usage of the language==

A poll conducted in Béarn in 1982 indicated that 51% of the population could speak Gascon, 70% understood it, and 85% expressed a favourable opinion regarding the protection of the language. However, use of the language has declined dramatically over recent years as a result of the Francization taking place during the last centuries, as Gascon is rarely transmitted to young generations any longer (outside of schools, such as the Calandretas).

By April 2011, the Endangered Languages Project estimated that there were only 250,000 native speakers of the language. 

The usual term for Gascon is &quot;patois&quot;, a word designating in France a non-official and usually devaluated dialect (such as Gallo) or language (such as Occitan), regardless of the concerned region. It is mainly in Béarn that the population uses concurrently the term &quot;Béarnais&quot; to designate its Gascon forms. This is because of the political past of Béarn, which was independent and then part of a sovereign state (the shrinking Kingdom of Navarre) from 1347 to 1620.

In fact, there is no unified Béarnais dialect, as the language differs considerably throughout the province. Many of the differences in pronunciation can be divided into east, west, and south (the mountainous regions). For example, an &#x27;a&#x27; at the end of words is pronounced &quot;ah&quot; in the west, &quot;o&quot; in the east, and &quot;œ&quot; in the south. Because of Béarn&#x27;s specific political past, Béarnais has been distinguished from Gascon since the 16th century, not for linguistic reasons.

== Influences on other languages ==

Probably as a consequence of the linguistic continuum of &quot;western Romania&quot; and the French influence over the Hispanic Mark on medieval times, shared similar and singular features are noticeable between Gascon and other Latin languages on the other side of the border: Aragonese and far-western Catalan (Catalan of La Franja).

Gascon is also (with Spanish, Navarro-Aragonese and French) one of the Romance influences on the Basque language.

<text>Oshun (also Ọṣun, Ochún, and Oxúm) is the Yoruba orisha associated with love, sexuality, fertility, femininity, water, destiny, divination, purity, and beauty, and the Osun River, and of wealth and prosperity in Voodoo. She is considered the most popular and venerated of the 401 orishas.

In the mythology, Oshun was once the queen consort to King Shango of Oyo, and deified following her death, honored at the Osun-Osogbo Festival, a two-week-long annual festival that usually takes place in August, at the Oṣun-Osogbo Sacred Grove in Osogbo. A violín is a type of musical ceremony in Regla de Ocha performed for Osún. It includes both European classical music and Cuban popular music.

== Mythology ==
According to the Ifa Literary Corpus, Oshun was the only female Irunmole (primordial spirit) sent to assist Shango to create the world by Olodumare, the Supreme God. The other spirits sent ignored Oshun, who went to Shango for guidance. One version of the story claims that female spirits were tempted to take matters into their own hands, but all of their creative attempts failed because they acted without male spiritual leadership. This version was possibly inspired Abrahamic religions, with a patriarchal influence.

Another version, one more consistent with the beginning of the story, claims that the male spirits attempted to make the world without female influence, and this exclusion is what caused the world to fail. Regardless of the version, the myth ends with Shango forcing the other spirits hand to respect Oshun as they would him. Following her death, Olodumare granted her the powers of an orisha.

== Worship ==

=== Yoruba ===
Oshun is the divine patroness of the Osun River in Nigeria, which bears her name. The river has its source in Ekiti State in the west of Nigeria and passes through the city of Osogbo, where Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove, the principal sanctuary of the deity, is located. Oṣun is honored at the Osun-Osogbo Festival, a two-week-long annual festival that usually takes place in August, at the Oṣun-Osogbo Sacred Grove on the banks of the river.

=== Brazil ===
Ọshun was adopted into Afro-Brazilian religions, retaining her role as the goddess of love, beauty, and waters, with the addition of power over wealth and prosperity. Followers seek help for romantic problems from Oshun; the orishá is also responsible for marriage and other relationships. As the orishá of financial life, she is also called the &quot;Lady of Gold&quot;. This referred to copper at one time for being the most valuable metal of the time. Oshun is worshiped at rivers and waterfalls, and more rarely, near mineral water sources. She is a symbol of sensitivity and is identified by weeping.

===Candomblé===
In Candomblé Bantu, Oshun is called Nkisi Ndandalunda, the Lady of Fertility and Moon. Hongolo and Kisimbi have similarities with Oshun, and the three are often confused.

In Candomblé Ketu, Oshun is the deity of fresh water; the patron of gestation and fecundity; and receives the prayers of women who wish to have children and protect them during pregnancy. Osun also protects small children until they begin to speak; she is affectionately called &quot;Mamãe&quot; (&quot;Mama&quot;) by her devotees. Plants associated with Osun in Brazil are aromatic, sweet, and often yellow, reflecting the qualities of the Orisha. They include mints (&quot;Lamiacaea&quot;). Osun is associated with the folha-de-dez-réis (&quot;Hydrocotyle cybelleta&quot;), a plant of the pennywort family. Many species are brilliant yellow, reflecting Osun&#x27;s association with gold and wealth. She is also associated with folha-da-fortuna, or &quot;Kalanchoe pinnata&quot;.

==Ozun==
Ozun is another major Orisha that is distinct from Oṣun, the latter who is also called &quot;Oshun&quot; and &quot;Ochún&quot; in the Santería religion of the Caribbean (Cuba, Puerto Rico and Trinidad) brought over by Yoruba people during the transatlantic slave trade. While Ozun is a masculine Orisha associated with John the Baptist, Ochún is syncretized with Our Lady of Charity.

<text>Seamus Costello (, 1939 – 5 October 1977) was an Irish politician. He was a leader of Official Sinn Féin and the Official Irish Republican Army and latterly of the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP) and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA).

He argued for a combination of socialist politics on economic issues and traditional physical force Irish republicanism. He is best remembered for the founding of the IRSP and the INLA. He was a victim of a feud with his former comrades in the Official IRA.

==Early life and IRA Border Campaign==
Born into a middle-class family in Bray, County Wicklow, he was educated at Christian Brothers College, Monkstown Park. He left school at 15 and became a mechanic and later car salesman in Dublin.

At the age of 16 he joined Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Army. Within a year, he was commanding an active service unit in south County Londonderry during the Border Campaign, where his leadership skills and burning down of the courthouse in Magherafelt earned him the nickname of &quot;the Boy General&quot;. The unit&#x27;s most publicised actions included the destruction of bridges.

He was arrested in Glencree, County Wicklow, in 1957 and sentenced to six months in Mountjoy Prison. On his release, he was immediately interned in the Curragh prison camp for two years.

He spent his time in prison studying. He was particularly inspired by his studies of the Vietnamese struggle for independence. He became a member of the escape committee which engineered the successful escapes of Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Dáithí Ó Conaill, among others. Costello would later refer to this time as his &quot;university days&quot;.

Costello eventually reached the rank of Adjutant-General of the IRA. In 1964 Costello was sent to the recently opened Chinese embassy in Paris to seek assistance from the Chinese government.

==Political activism==
After his release, Costello worked to rebuild the republican movement, beginning by building a local base of support in County Wicklow as Sinn Féin&#x27;s local organiser. Costello strongly supported the movement&#x27;s left-wing orientation of these years, especially its emphasis on grassroots political activism. He helped found a strong tenants&#x27; association in Bray, and also became involved with the credit union movement and various farmers&#x27; organisations. During this period he married a woman, Maeliosa Gaynor from Rapla near Nenagh, County Tipperary, who also became active in the republican movement. Costello was elected to both Bray Urban District Council and Wicklow County Council in 1966.

After the Troubles broke out in Northern Ireland in 1969, factions in both the IRA and Sinn Féin were divided over abstentionism and the left-wing faction&#x27;s socialist politics. The republican movement divided into Official and Provisional movements in 1969/70, but Costello remained with the Officials, owing to a greater commitment to left-wing politics. He served as vice-president of Official Sinn Féin and as a staff officer in the Official IRA.

He was the Official IRA&#x27;s Director of Operations.

Costello was opposed to the 1972 ceasefire and started to clash openly with the leadership, in particular with Eoin Ó Murchú. Costello was subjected to court martial in 1974. Brigid Makowski, who was called to testify at his court martial in Mornington in County Meath, remarked that &quot;Jesus could have testified on Costello&#x27;s behalf and it wouldn&#x27;t have changed the verdict.&quot; He was dismissed from OSF in 1974 after the OSF leadership blocked his supporters from attending the party convention.

He stood again in the 1974 local elections and topped the poll for the Wicklow County Council and the Bray Urban District Council.

==Founds INLA and IRSP==
At a meeting in the Lucan Spa Hotel near Dublin, on 8 December 1974, the Irish Republican Socialist Party was formed by republicans, socialists, and trade unionists with Costello as the chairperson.

At a private meeting later the same day, the Irish National Liberation Army was formed with Costello as the Chief of Staff, although its existence was to be kept secret for a time. The new grouping intended to combine left-wing politics with the &quot;armed struggle&quot; against British security forces in Northern Ireland.

Within days of its founding, the fledgling Irish Republican Socialist Movement was embroiled in a bitter feud with the Official IRA. The feud resulted in the attempted assassination of Official IRA leader Sean Garland who was wounded in an INLA attack near his home in the Ballymun area of Dublin (Garland was wounded six times but survived the attack). Before a truce was reached, three members of the IRSP were dead. Later that same year, Bernadette Devlin McAliskey resigned from the IRSP over the failure of a motion that would have brought the INLA under IRSP control, taking over half of the Ard Chomhairle members with her.

In July 1976 Costello was replaced as INLA chief-of-staff by South Londonderry man Eddy McNicholl, although he still wielded considerable influence within the movement, retaining his position as chairman of the IRSP.

==Assassination==
Despite the truce, Costello was shot dead with a shotgun as he sat in his car on Northbrook Avenue, off the North Strand Road in Dublin on 5 October 1977 allegedly by a member of the Official IRA, Jim Flynn, who happened to be in the area at the time. The Official and Provisional IRAs both denied responsibility and Sinn Féin/The Workers&#x27; Party issued a statement condemning the killing. Members of an opposing INLA faction in Belfast also denied the killing. However, the INLA eventually deemed Flynn the person responsible, and he was shot dead in June 1982 in the North Strand, Dublin, very close to the spot where Costello died.

Costello is the only leader of an Irish political party killed to date.

At the time of his death, he was a member of the following bodies:
* Wicklow County Council
* County Wicklow Committee of Agriculture
* General Council of Committees of Agriculture
* Eastern Regional Development Organisation
* National Museum Development Committee
* Bray Urban District Council
* Bray Branch of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union
* Bray and District Trade Unions Council (of which he was president 1976–77)
* Cualann Historical Society
as well as still holding the positions of
* Chairperson of the IRSP and
* Chief of Staff of the INLA.

His funeral was attended by Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, the then president of Sinn Féin, Michael O&#x27;Riordan of the Communist Party of Ireland, Bernadette McAliskey and local Wicklow TDs Liam Kavanagh (Labour), Ciarán Murphy (Fianna Fáil) and Godfrey Timmins (Fine Gael). At his funeral, former Senator Nora Connolly O&#x27;Brien, daughter of the Easter Rising leader James Connolly, gave the oration.
Of all the politicians and political people with whom I have had conversations and who called themselves followers of Connolly, he was the only one who truly understood what James Connolly meant when he spoke of his vision of the freedom of the Irish people.

<text>Ọya (Yorùbá: &quot;Ọya&quot;, also known as Oyáor Oiá; Yàńsàn-án or Yansã; and Iansá, Iansã, or Iansan in Latin America) is an Orisha of winds, lightning, and violent storms. As a river deity she is also regarded as a deity of children, able to provide children to her devotees or those who come to her banks at the Niger river. 

== Beliefs ==
Ọya lived on Earth as a human from the town of Ira, in present day Kwara state, Nigeria, where she was a wife of the Alaafin of Oyo, Shango. In Yorùbá, the name Ọya is believed to derive from the phrase coined from &quot;ọ ya&quot; which means &quot;she tore,&quot; referring to her association with powerful winds. She was believed to have the power to shape-shift into a buffalo, and is often depicted as one in traditional Yorùbá poetry. As such, the buffalo serves as a major symbol of Ọya, and it is forbidden for her priests to kill one. She is known as Ọya Ìyáńsàn-án, the &quot;mother of nine&quot;, because of the nine children she gave birth to with her third husband Oko, after suffering from a lifetime of barrenness. She is the patroness of the Niger River (known to the Yorùbá as the Odò-Ọya).

In the Yoruba religion, Ọya was married three times, first to the warrior orisha Ogun, then Shango, and finally, another hunting and farming deity, Oko.

Oya was traditionally worshipped only in the areas of Yorubaland once under the control and influence of the Oyo Empire. Because of the Atlantic slave trade, many of her followers of Oyo origin were kidnapped and sold to the New World, where her worship became widespread. Oya worship has also spread to other parts of Yorubaland. 

==Candomblé==
In Candomblé, Oya is known as Oiá, lyá Mésàn, or most commonly, Iansã, from the Yoruba &quot;Yánsán&quot;. Iansã, as in Yoruba religion, commands winds, storms, and lightning. She is the queen of the river Niger and the mother of nine. She is a warrior and is unbeatable. Attributes of Iansã include great intensity of feelings, sensations, and charm. Another ability attributed to Iansã is control over the mysteries that surround the dead. Iansã is syncretized with Saint Barbara. In the Candomblé &quot;nação&quot; (association) of Angola Congo, Iansã is associated with the color red.

===Characteristics===
* Salutation: &quot;Eeparrei!&quot;, or &quot;Epahhey, Oia!&quot;
* Consecrated day: Thursday
* Colors: red, purple and rainbow, burgundy
* Symbols: &quot;Buffalo tail&quot; &quot;eruquerê&quot;, a ritual object; or a copper sword
* Prohibitions: pumpkin, stingray, and mutton
* Food: acarajé/àkàrà

===Ritual foods===
Acarajé is a spherical patty made with peeled, crushed black-eyed peas, stuffed with small shrimp, okra, crushed peanuts, and other savory, piquant spices. The ball-like patty is fried in dendê oil (red palm oil). It&#x27;s a traditional Afro-Brazilian dish that is also a traditional offering to Iansã in the Candomblé tradition. A simple, unseasoned form of acarajé is used in rituals and a version served with various condiments is sold as a common street food in Bahia in the northeast of Brazil. Ipeté and bobo de inhame are also associated with Iansã.

In Yorùbá, her food is Àkàrà. Eggplant, mulberries, pudding, and dark chocolate are also foods for Oya.

<text>Biogeography is the study of the distribution of species and ecosystems in geographic space and through geological time. Organisms and biological communities often vary in a regular fashion along geographic gradients of latitude, elevation, isolation and habitat area. Phytogeography is the branch of biogeography that studies the distribution of plants. Zoogeography is the branch that studies distribution of animals. Mycogeography is the branch that studies distribution of fungi, such as mushrooms.

Knowledge of spatial variation in the numbers and types of organisms is as vital to us today as it was to our early human ancestors, as we adapt to heterogeneous but geographically predictable environments. Biogeography is an integrative field of inquiry that unites concepts and information from ecology, evolutionary biology, taxonomy, geology, physical geography, palaeontology, and climatology.

Modern biogeographic research combines information and ideas from many fields, from the physiological and ecological constraints on organismal dispersal to geological and climatological phenomena operating at global spatial scales and evolutionary time frames.

The short-term interactions within a habitat and species of organisms describe the ecological application of biogeography. Historical biogeography describes the long-term, evolutionary periods of time for broader classifications of organisms. Early scientists, beginning with Carl Linnaeus, contributed to the development of biogeography as a science.

The scientific theory of biogeography grows out of the work of Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), Francisco Jose de Caldas (1768–1816), Hewett Cottrell Watson (1804–1881), Alphonse de Candolle (1806–1893), Alfred Russel Wallace (1823–1913), Philip Lutley Sclater (1829–1913) and other biologists and explorers.

==Introduction==
The patterns of species distribution across geographical areas can usually be explained through a combination of historical factors such as: speciation, extinction, continental drift, and glaciation. Through observing the geographic distribution of species, we can see associated variations in sea level, river routes, habitat, and river capture. Additionally, this science considers the geographic constraints of landmass areas and isolation, as well as the available ecosystem energy supplies.

Over periods of ecological changes, biogeography includes the study of plant and animal species in: their past and/or present living &quot;refugium&quot; habitat; their interim living sites; and/or their survival locales. As writer David Quammen put it, &quot;...biogeography does more than ask &quot;Which species?&quot; and &quot;Where&quot;. It also asks &quot;Why?&quot; and, what is sometimes more crucial, &quot;Why not?&quot;.&quot;

Modern biogeography often employs the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), to understand the factors affecting organism distribution, and to predict future trends in organism distribution.
Often mathematical models and GIS are employed to solve ecological problems that have a spatial aspect to them.

Biogeography is most keenly observed on the world&#x27;s islands. These habitats are often much more manageable areas of study because they are more condensed than larger ecosystems on the mainland. Islands are also ideal locations because they allow scientists to look at habitats that new invasive species have only recently colonized and can observe how they disperse throughout the island and change it. They can then apply their understanding to similar but more complex mainland habitats. Islands are very diverse in their biomes, ranging from the tropical to arctic climates. This diversity in habitat allows for a wide range of species study in different parts of the world.

One scientist who recognized the importance of these geographic locations was Charles Darwin, who remarked in his journal &quot;The Zoology of Archipelagoes will be well worth examination&quot;. Two chapters in &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; were devoted to geographical distribution.

==History==
===18th century===
The first discoveries that contributed to the development of biogeography as a science began in the mid-18th century, as Europeans explored the world and described the biodiversity of life. During the 18th century most views on the world were shaped around religion and for many natural theologists, the bible. Carl Linnaeus, in the mid-18th century, improved our classifications of organisms through the exploration of undiscovered territories by his students and disciples. When he noticed that species were not as perpetual as he believed, he developed the Mountain Explanation to explain the distribution of biodiversity; when Noah&#x27;s ark landed on Mount Ararat and the waters receded, the animals dispersed throughout different elevations on the mountain. This showed different species in different climates proving species were not constant. Linnaeus&#x27; findings set a basis for ecological biogeography. Through his strong beliefs in Christianity, he was inspired to classify the living world, which then gave way to additional accounts of secular views on geographical distribution. He argued that the structure of an animal was very closely related to its physical surroundings. This was important to a George Louis Buffon&#x27;s rival theory of distribution.

Closely after Linnaeus, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon observed shifts in climate and how species spread across the globe as a result. He was the first to see different groups of organisms in different regions of the world. Buffon saw similarities between some regions which led him to believe that at one point continents were connected and then water separated them and caused differences in species. His hypotheses were described in his work, the 36 volume &quot;Histoire Naturelle, générale et particulière&quot;, in which he argued that varying geographical regions would have different forms of life. This was inspired by his observations comparing the Old and New World, as he determined distinct variations of species from the two regions. Buffon believed there was a single species creation event, and that different regions of the world were homes for varying species, which is an alternate view than that of Linnaeus. Buffon&#x27;s law eventually became a principle of biogeography by explaining how similar environments were habitats for comparable types of organisms. Buffon also studied fossils which led him to believe that the Earth was over tens of thousands of years old, and that humans had not lived there long in comparison to the age of the Earth.

===19th century===
Following the period of exploration came the Age of Enlightenment in Europe, which attempted to explain the patterns of biodiversity observed by Buffon and Linnaeus. At the birth of the 19th century, Alexander von Humboldt, known as the &quot;founder of plant geography&quot;, developed the concept of physique generale to demonstrate the unity of science and how species fit together. As one of the first to contribute empirical data to the science of biogeography through his travel as an explorer, he observed differences in climate and vegetation. The Earth was divided into regions which he defined as tropical, temperate, and arctic and within these regions there were similar forms of vegetation. This ultimately enabled him to create the isotherm, which allowed scientists to see patterns of life within different climates. He contributed his observations to findings of botanical geography by previous scientists, and sketched this description of both the biotic and abiotic features of the Earth in his book, &quot;Cosmos&quot;.

Augustin de Candolle contributed to the field of biogeography as he observed species competition and the several differences that influenced the discovery of the diversity of life. He was a Swiss botanist and created the first Laws of Botanical Nomenclature in his work, Prodromus. He discussed plant distribution and his theories eventually had a great impact on Charles Darwin, who was inspired to consider species adaptations and evolution after learning about botanical geography. De Candolle was the first to describe the differences between the small-scale and large-scale distribution patterns of organisms around the globe.

Several additional scientists contributed new theories to further develop the concept of biogeography. Charles Lyell developed the Theory of Uniformitarianism after studying fossils. This theory explained how the world was not created by one sole catastrophic event, but instead from numerous creation events and locations. Uniformitarianism also introduced the idea that the Earth was actually significantly older than was previously accepted. Using this knowledge, Lyell concluded that it was possible for species to go extinct. Since he noted that Earth&#x27;s climate changes, he realized that species distribution must also change accordingly. Lyell argued that climate changes complemented vegetation changes, thus connecting the environmental surroundings to varying species. This largely influenced Charles Darwin in his development of the theory of evolution.

Charles Darwin was a natural theologist who studied around the world, and most importantly in the Galapagos Islands. Darwin introduced the idea of natural selection, as he theorized against previously accepted ideas that species were static or unchanging. His contributions to biogeography and the theory of evolution were different from those of other explorers of his time, because he developed a mechanism to describe the ways that species changed. His influential ideas include the development of theories regarding the struggle for existence and natural selection. Darwin&#x27;s theories started a biological segment to biogeography and empirical studies, which enabled future scientists to develop ideas about the geographical distribution of organisms around the globe.

Alfred Russel Wallace studied the distribution of flora and fauna in the Amazon Basin and the Malay Archipelago in the mid-19th century. His research was essential to the further development of biogeography, and he was later nicknamed the &quot;father of Biogeography&quot;. Wallace conducted fieldwork researching the habits, breeding and migration tendencies, and feeding behavior of thousands of species. He studied butterfly and bird distributions in comparison to the presence or absence of geographical barriers. His observations led him to conclude that the number of organisms present in a community was dependent on the amount of food resources in the particular habitat. Wallace believed species were dynamic by responding to biotic and abiotic factors. He and Philip Sclater saw biogeography as a source of support for the theory of evolution as they used Darwin&#x27;s conclusion to explain how biogeography was similar to a record of species inheritance. Key findings, such as the sharp difference in fauna either side of the Wallace Line, and the sharp difference that existed between North and South America prior to their relatively recent faunal interchange, can only be understood in this light. Otherwise, the field of biogeography would be seen as a purely descriptive one.

===20th and 21st century===

Moving on to the 20th century, Alfred Wegener introduced the Theory of Continental Drift in 1912, though it was not widely accepted until the 1960s. This theory was revolutionary because it changed the way that everyone thought about species and their distribution around the globe. The theory explained how continents were formerly joined in one large landmass, Pangea, and slowly drifted apart due to the movement of the plates below Earth&#x27;s surface. The evidence for this theory is in the geological similarities between varying locations around the globe, the geographic distribution of some fossils (including the mesosaurs) on various continents, and the jigsaw puzzle shape of the landmasses on Earth. Though Wegener did not know the mechanism of this concept of Continental Drift, this contribution to the study of biogeography was significant in the way that it shed light on the importance of environmental and geographic similarities or differences as a result of climate and other pressures on the planet. Importantly, late in his career Wegener recognised that testing his theory required measurement of continental movement rather than inference from fossils species distributions.

In 1958 paleontologist Paul S. Martin published &quot;A Biogeography of Reptiles and Amphibians in the Gómez Farias Region, Tamaulipas, Mexico&quot;, which has been described as &quot;ground-breaking&quot; and &quot;a classic treatise in historical biogeography&quot;. Martin applied several disciplines including ecology, botany, climatology, geology, and Pleistocene dispersal routes to examine the herpetofauna of a relatively small and largely undisturbed area, but ecologically complex, situated on the threshold of temperate – tropical (nearctic and neotropical) regions, including semiarid lowlands at 70 meters elevation and the northernmost cloud forest in the western hemisphere at over 2200 meters.

The publication of &quot;The Theory of Island Biogeography&quot; by Robert MacArthur and E.O. Wilson in 1967 showed that the species richness of an area could be predicted in terms of such factors as habitat area, immigration rate and extinction rate. This added to the long-standing interest in island biogeography. The application of island biogeography theory to habitat fragments spurred the development of the fields of conservation biology and landscape ecology.

Classic biogeography has been expanded by the development of molecular systematics, creating a new discipline known as phylogeography. This development allowed scientists to test theories about the origin and dispersal of populations, such as island endemics. For example, while classic biogeographers were able to speculate about the origins of species in the Hawaiian Islands, phylogeography allows them to test theories of relatedness between these populations and putative source populations on various continents, notably in Asia and North America.

Biogeography continues as a point of study for many life sciences and geography students worldwide, however it may be under different broader titles within institutions such as ecology or evolutionary biology.

In recent years, one of the most important and consequential developments in biogeography has been to show how multiple organisms, including mammals like monkeys and reptiles like squamates, overcame barriers such as large oceans that many biogeographers formerly believed were impossible to cross. See also Oceanic dispersal.

==Modern applications==

Biogeography now incorporates many different fields including but not limited to physical geography, geology, botany and plant biology, zoology, general biology, and modelling. A biogeographer&#x27;s main focus is on how the environment and humans affect the distribution of species as well as other manifestations of Life such as species or genetic diversity. Biogeography is being applied to biodiversity conservation and planning, projecting global environmental changes on species and biomes, projecting the spread of infectious diseases, invasive species, and for supporting planning for the establishment of crops. Technological evolving and advances have allowed for generating a whole suite of predictor variables for biogeographic analysis, including satellite imaging and processing of the Earth. Two main types of satellite imaging that are important within modern biogeography are Global Production Efficiency Model (GLO-PEM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GLO-PEM uses satellite-imaging gives &quot;repetitive, spatially contiguous, and time specific observations of vegetation&quot;. These observations are on a global scale. GIS can show certain processes on the earth&#x27;s surface like whale locations, sea surface temperatures, and bathymetry. Current scientists also use coral reefs to delve into the history of biogeography through the fossilized reefs.

Two global information systems are either dedicated to, or have strong focus on, biogeography (in the form of the spatial location of observations of organisms), namely the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF: 2.57 billion species occurrence records reported as at August 2023) and, for marine species only, the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS, originally the &quot;Ocean Biogeographic Information System&quot;: 116 million species occurrence records reported as at August 2023), while at a national scale, similar compilations of species occurrence records also exist such as the U.K. National Biodiversity Network, the Atlas of Living Australia, and many others. In the case of the oceans, in 2017 Costello &quot;et al.&quot; analyzed the distribution of 65,000 species of marine animals and plants as then documented in OBIS, and used the results to distinguish 30 distinct marine realms, split between continental-shelf and offshore deep-sea areas.

Since it is self evident that compilations of species occurrence records cannot cover with any completeness, areas that have received either limited or no sampling, a number of methods have been developed to produce arguably more complete &quot;predictive&quot; or &quot;modelled&quot; distributions for species based on their associated environmental or other preferences (such as availability of food or other habitat requirements); this approach is known as either Environmental niche modelling (ENM) or Species distribution modelling (SDM). Depending on the reliability of the source data and the nature of the models employed (including the scales for which data are available), maps generated from such models may then provide better representations of the &quot;real&quot; biogeographic distributions of either individual species, groups of species, or biodiversity as a whole, however it should also be borne in mind that historic or recent human activities (such as hunting of great whales, or other human-induced exterminations) may have altered present-day species distributions from their potential &quot;full&quot; ecological footprint. Examples of predictive maps produced by niche modelling methods based on either GBIF (terrestrial) or OBIS (marine, plus some freshwater) data are the former &quot;Lifemapper&quot; project at the University of Kansas (now continued as a part of &quot;BiotaPhy&quot;) and AquaMaps, which as at 2023 contain modelled distributions for around 200,000 terrestrial, and 33,000 species of teleosts, marine mammals and invertebrates, respectively. One advantage of ENM/SDM is that in addition to showing current (or even past) modelled distributions, insertion of changed parameters such as the anticipated effects of climate change can also be used to show potential changes in species distributions that may occur in the future based on such scenarios.

==Paleobiogeography==
Paleobiogeography goes one step further to include paleogeographic data and considerations of plate tectonics. Using molecular analyses and corroborated by fossils, it has been possible to demonstrate that perching birds evolved first in the region of Australia or the adjacent Antarctic (which at that time lay somewhat further north and had a temperate climate). From there, they spread to the other Gondwanan continents and Southeast Asia – the part of Laurasia then closest to their origin of dispersal – in the late Paleogene, before achieving a global distribution in the early Neogene. Not knowing that at the time of dispersal, the Indian Ocean was much narrower than it is today, and that South America was closer to the Antarctic, one would be hard pressed to explain the presence of many &quot;ancient&quot; lineages of perching birds in Africa, as well as the mainly South American distribution of the suboscines.

Paleobiogeography also helps constrain hypotheses on the timing of biogeographic events such as vicariance and geodispersal, and provides unique information on the formation of regional biotas. For example, data from species-level phylogenetic and biogeographic studies tell us that the Amazonian teleost fauna accumulated in increments over a period of tens of millions of years, principally by means of allopatric speciation, and in an arena extending over most of the area of tropical South America (Albert &amp; Reis 2011). In other words, unlike some of the well-known insular faunas (Galapagos finches, Hawaiian drosophilid flies, African rift lake cichlids), the species-rich Amazonian ichthyofauna is not the result of recent adaptive radiations.

For freshwater organisms, landscapes are divided naturally into discrete drainage basins by watersheds, episodically isolated and reunited by erosional processes. In regions like the Amazon Basin (or more generally Greater Amazonia, the Amazon basin, Orinoco basin, and Guianas) with an exceptionally low (flat) topographic relief, the many waterways have had a highly reticulated history over geological time. In such a context, stream capture is an important factor affecting the evolution and distribution of freshwater organisms. Stream capture occurs when an upstream portion of one river drainage is diverted to the downstream portion of an adjacent basin. This can happen as a result of tectonic uplift (or subsidence), natural damming created by a landslide, or headward or lateral erosion of the watershed between adjacent basins.

==Concepts and fields==
Biogeography is a synthetic science, related to geography, biology, soil science, geology, climatology, ecology and evolution.

Some fundamental concepts in biogeography include:
* allopatric speciation – the splitting of a species by evolution of geographically isolated populations
* evolution – change in genetic composition of a population
* extinction – disappearance of a species
* dispersal – movement of populations away from their point of origin, related to migration
* endemic areas
* geodispersal – the erosion of barriers to dispersal and gene flow, that permit range expansion and the merging of previously isolated biotas
* range and distribution
* vicariance – the formation of barriers to biotic dispersal and gene flow, that tend to subdivide species and biotas, leading to speciation and extinction; vicariance biogeography is the field that studies these patterns

===Comparative biogeography===
The study of comparative biogeography can follow two main lines of investigation:
* Systematic biogeography, the study of biotic area relationships, their distribution, and hierarchical classification
* Evolutionary biogeography, the proposal of evolutionary mechanisms responsible for organismal distributions. Possible mechanisms include widespread taxa disrupted by continental break-up or individual episodes of long-distance movement.

==Biogeographic regionalisations==
There are many types of biogeographic units used in biogeographic regionalisation schemes, as there are many criteria (species composition, physiognomy, ecological aspects) and hierarchization schemes: biogeographic realms (ecozones), bioregions (&quot;sensu stricto&quot;), ecoregions, zoogeographical regions, floristic regions, vegetation types, biomes, etc.

The terms biogeographic unit, biogeographic area can be used for these categories, regardless of rank.

In 2008, an International Code of Area Nomenclature was proposed for biogeography. It achieved limited success; some studies commented favorably on it, but others were much more critical, and it &quot;has not yet gained a significant following&quot;. Similarly, a set of rules for paleobiogeography has achieved limited success. In 2000, Westermann suggested that the difficulties in getting formal nomenclatural rules established in this field might be related to &quot;the curious fact that neither paleo- nor neobiogeographers are organized in any formal groupings or societies, nationally (so far as I know) or internationally — an exception among active disciplines.&quot;

<text>Olorun (Yoruba alphabet: &quot;Ọlọrun&quot;) (Ede language: &quot;ɔlɔrun&quot;) is the ruler of (or in) the Heavens creator of the Yoruba. The Supreme Deity or Supreme Being in the Yoruba pantheon, Olorun is also called Olodumare (Yoruba alphabet: &quot;Olódùmarè&quot;), Eledumare and Eleduwa/Eledua.

In Yoruba culture, Ọlọrun is credited with creating the universe and all living things. Ọlọrun is frequently perceived as a compassionate entity who protects its creations and is thought to be omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent. People do not worship Olorun directly; there are no sacred areas of worship, no iconography.

His ordained are known to be Obatalá of which he appointed a divine sun OlúwaṢówjon. Olorun is outlying, distant, and does not partake in human rituals. There are no shrines or sacrifices dedicated directly to them, although followers can send prayers in their direction.

Olorun has no gender in the Ifá Literary Corpus, and is always referred to as an entity who exists in spiritual form only. Christian missionaries, such as Bolaji Idowu, aimed to reinterpret traditional Yoruba culture as consistent with Christian theology as a way of pushing conversion. The first translation of the Bible into Yoruba in the late 1800s by Samuel Ajayi Crowther controversially adopted traditional Yoruba names, such as &quot;Olodumare/Olorun&quot; for &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Eshu&quot; for the devil, and thus began associating Olorun with the male gender.

For Yoruba traditions, there is no centralized authority; because of this, there are many different ways that Yoruba people and their descendants or orisa-based faiths can understand the idea of Olorun.

Historically, the Yoruba worship Olorun through the agency of the orisa; thus there is no image, shrine or sacrifice made directly towards Olorun, since Olorun is known to BE everything, and everywhere. There is some controversy about whether Olodumare is directly worshiped, due to their aloofness from humanity, or due to the belief that Olorun already is ALL manifestation of life and existence, and the believer is bound to be grateful and loving towards all existence, and all beings, since Olorun IS everything. However, there are those who also worship Olodumare directly. Olodumare is the origin of virtue and mortality, and bestows the knowledge of things upon all persons when they are born. Olorun is omnipotent, transcendent, unique, all knowing, good, and evil. These &quot;orisa&quot; or orishas are supernatural beings, both good (&quot;egungun&quot;) and bad (&quot;ajogun&quot;), who represent human activity and natural forces, all at the same time, and is all harmonious, all possessed of equilibrium and worth.

==Western ideology==
* Olodumare – the Lord God of the Source of Creation
** Olorun – the Lord God of Heaven 

In Trinidad Orisha, this god is known as Orun. Creator of the cosmology and all that exists, Babalú-Ayé.

== Etymology ==
From the Yoruba language, Olorun&#x27;s name is a contraction of the words &quot;oní&quot; (which denotes ownership or rulership) and &quot;ọ̀run&quot; (which means the Heavens, abode of the spirits).

Another name, Olodumare, comes from the phrase &quot;O ní odù mà rè&quot; meaning &quot;the owner of the source of creation that does not become empty,&quot; &quot;or the All Sufficient&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* Olorun is mentioned in the song &quot;The Rhythm of the Saints&quot; from the 1990 album &quot;The Rhythm of the Saints&quot; by Paul Simon.
* Olorun appears as one of the gods in the 2014 video game &quot;Smite&quot;.
*Eledumare is mentioned in the 2018 song &quot;Soco&quot; by Starboy featuring Wizkid.

<text>Oduduwa was a Yoruba divine king, legendary founder of the Ife Empire and a creator deity (orisha) in the Yoruba religion. His earthly origins are from the village of Oke Ora According to tradition, he was the holder of the title of the &quot;Olofin&quot; of Ile-Ife, the Yoruba holy city. He ruled briefly in Ife, and also served as the progenitor of a number of independent royal dynasties in Yorubaland.

In Yoruba religious traditions, Oduduwa is seen as a divine or semi-divine being that was sent by the creator deity, Olodumare, from heaven to create the earth upon the waters. These beliefs are held by Yoruba traditionalists to be the cornerstone of their story of creation. Obatala, Oduduwa&#x27;s sibling, and Oduduwa here are represented symbolically by a calabash, with Obatala taking the top and Oduduwa taking the bottom. In this narrative, Oduduwa is also known as &quot;Olofin Otete&quot;, The one who took the calabash of existence (Igbá Ìwà) from Olodumare.

Historical accounts on the other hand holds that he migrated into the Ife valley from Oke Ora, a community to Ife&#x27;s east. The time and length of his reign are not certain, but Yoruba spirituality believes that Oduduwa is believed to be as old as time itself.
Oduduwa was the first ruler of a unified Ife, which before him had existed as a group of loosely allied communities of thirteen &quot;Elu&quot;. He is also the founding father of various independent royal dynasties in Yorubaland, and is today venerated as “the hero, the warrior, the leader, and the father of the Yoruba race”.

==Etymology==
The etymological derivation of the Yoruba name “Oduduwa” is: Odu-ti-o-da-uwa (i.e. Odu-ti-o-da-iwa).

This translates literally to: The great repository which brings forth existence.

== Ife traditions ==
Ife tradition, which modern Yoruba historians accord precedence, relates that Oduduwa was a personage who migrated from the community of Oke Ora, a hilltop abode to the east of the original Ife confederacy of communities known as the Elu. Leadership of the confederal agreement that existed between the thirteen communities of what would become Ife was structured to be rotational between the Obas of each community taking turns at chairmanship. The communities are remembered to be; Iloromu, Imojubi, Ideta (Idita), Oke-Oja, Parakin, Ido, Iwinrin, Odin, Ijugbe, Iraye, Oke-Awo, Iloran and Omologun. At that time Oduduwa and his followers migrated down into the ife valley below, there was a brewing level of dissatisfaction amongst the communities on the issue of Obatala&#x27;s kingship, which was unsatisfactory to some.

Oduduwa and his group are believed to have disrupted the political structure of the 13 communities through the support of about 6 (&quot;Elu Mefa&quot;) of the 13 component communities. Rather than deposing Obatala, the town was divided into two with both figures serving as kings of their respective groups. His reign was largely restricted to Idio. However, Ife tradition states that he was never known as an Ooni and neither did he use the Ife traditional crown.

Oduduwa had only one son whose name was ‘Okanbi’, who also went by the alias ‘Idekoserake’. Okanbi, in turn, gave birth to seven children: the first of them being two princesses after which came five princes.

Through war lasting many years, Oduduwa was able to defeat the forces of the 13 indigenous communities of Ife led by Obatala (the most powerful and sweetest god) and formed these communities into a single Ife state.

He held the praise names Olofin Adimula, Olofin Aye and Olufe. Since he is held by the Yoruba to have been the ancestor of their numerous crowned kings, his name, phonetically written by Yoruba language-speakers as Odùduwà and sometimes contracted as Ooduwa, Odudua or Oòdua, is generally ascribed to the ancestral dynasties of Yorubaland.
Following his posthumous deification, he was admitted to the Yoruba pantheon as an aspect of a primordial divinity of the same name, historical accounts state.

===Later years===
The leadership contest was brought to an end following the collaborative effort of Obatala, Orunmila and Owa Ilare. The three figures were able to facilitate the death of Oduduwa. Following this, a major part of Oduduwa&#x27;s support base dispersed – this has been reinterpreted to mean a dispersal of his children and grandchildren from Ife to the outposts that they had previously founded or gained influence over.

Obalufon II Alayemore was on the throne when Oranmiyan, the son of Ogun but often associated with Oduduwa, returned from his sojourn and contested Obalufon&#x27;s kingship. It is unclear how Lajamisan is Oranmiyan&#x27;s son, though he brutally seized the throne and is arguably the progenitor of all of the Oonis that have reigned in Ife from his time till now, prompting historians to label it the Lajamisan dynasty, which has remained unbroken for almost 700 years.

==Oranmiyan==

Oranmiyan is said to have been a biological son of Ogun, who was in turn the son of Oduduwa and his war captain, hence the misconception that Oranmiyan had two fathers. He was one of the most adventurous of the Yoruba historical figures. The controversy surrounding his birth is due to the fact that both Oduduwa and Ogun had affairs with the same woman, his mother, Lakange. Ogun was a warrior whose expedition led to capturing Lakange as war booty and he had sexual relations with her. Oduduwa equally desired the woman and had sexual relations with her while she was pregnant. Whatever the case, the affair resulted in the birth of Odede, otherwise known as Oranmiyan. Oranmiyan would later become the first Alaafin of Oyo and, later, the Ooni of Ife. He ruled also in the Kingdom of Benin for a while after a crisis among the people of Benin forced them to consult Oduduwa to send them a ruler who will rule over them, but left to return to Ife after finding the People of the Benin Kingdom ungovernable, Prior to his departure from Benin Kingdom, he married a Benin woman with whom he had a son called Eweka who later proceeded to the throne, and is the progenitor of all the Obas in the Kingdom of Benin to the present day.

==Moremi and the Ugbo==
After the dispersal of most members of the family of Oduduwa, the aborigines became ungovernable and constituted themselves as a serious threat to the survival of Ife. Thought to be descendants of Oranfe through Obalufon Ogbogbodinrin (Osangangan Obamakin) who had ruled the land before the arrival of Oranmiyan, these people turned themselves into marauders. They would come to town in costumes made of raffia with terrible and fearsome appearances, burn down houses and loot the markets. It is at this point that Moremi Ajasoro, a woman from Igun in Ile-Ife, came onto the scene. She was married to Lukugba, Obalufon Alayemore, and Oranmiyan at different times; she subsequently played a significant role in restoring normalcy to the situation through a spying mission. She allowed herself to be captured and taken away with the marauders. Subsequent to this, she married the king of the Ugbo. Her new husband wanted pleasure from her, but she would not give in because she was already married and was on a mission. She told him to tell her the secret of the marauders; he initially refused to but after great insistence on her part, he gave in. He told her that the only thing they feared was fire; if they saw fire, they would retreat. With this information, she concocted an escape plan. She asked for some oranges and prepared a formula that drugged the palace entourage, causing them to fall into a deep slumber. When they woke up, they found that she had escaped to inform her people of their weakness. Using this information, the people of Ife were well prepared to face the marauders.

==Alternative views==
===Oduduwa and his/her role in creation ===
Yoruba religious traditions about the dawn of time claim that Oduduwa was Olodumare&#x27;s favorite Orisa. As such, he (or she, as the primordial Oduduwa originally represented the Divine Feminine aspect and Obatala the Divine Masculine) was sent from heaven to create the earth upon the waters, a mission he/she had usurped from his/her consort and sibling Obatala, who had been equipped with a snail shell filled with sand and a rooster to scatter the said sand in order to create land. These beliefs, held by Yoruba traditionalists, are said to be the cornerstone of their story of creation. Obatala and Oduduwa here are represented symbolically by a calabash, with Obatala taking the top and Oduduwa taking the bottom. In this narrative, Oduduwa is also known as &quot;Olofin Otete&quot;, the one who took the Basket of Existence from Olodumare.

Another depiction of Oduduwa as being the wife of Obatala is presented in Odu Ifa Osa Meji, a verse of the Ifa oracle. In this Odu, Obatala discovers the secret of his wife and steals the masquerade&#x27;s robes from her to wear it himself. This is suggested to be a historical representation of a switch from matriarchy to patriarchy.

This cosmological tradition has sometimes been blended with the tradition of the historical Oduduwa. According to others, the historical Oduduwa is considered to be named after the earlier version of Oduduwa, who is female and related to the Earth called Ile.

The earlier traditions of either a gender-fluid or an expressly female Oduduwa are seen in the spirit&#x27;s representation in the Gelede tradition. Initiates of Gelede receive a shrine to Oduduwa along with a Gelede costume and mask. This speaks to Oduduwa as being associated with the divine ancestral mothers that are known as Awon iya wa or Iyami. Here, Oduduwa is revered as the mother of the Yoruba.

===Non-Yoruba views===
Certain other people have claimed a connection to Oduduwa. According to the Kanuri, Yauri, Gobir, Acipu, Jukun and Borgu tribes, whose founding ancestors were said to be Oduduwa&#x27;s brothers (as recorded in the 19th century by Samuel Johnson), Oduduwa was the son of Damerudu, whom Yoruba call &quot;Lamurudu&quot;, a prince who was himself the son of the magician King Kisra. Kisra and his allies are said to have fought Muhammad in the Battle of Badr and Kisra was forced to migrate from Arabia into Africa after losing the war to the jihadists in 624 AD. According to the legend, he and his followers founded many kingdoms and ruling dynasties along their migration route into West Africa. This tradition is a variant of the belief, popular amongst some Muslims, that held that Oduduwa was a prince originating from Mecca. However, it is thought by some scholars to derive from the later influences on Yoruba culture of Islam and other Abrahamic religions and conflicts with other traditions in the Yoruba traditional corpus.

<text>Kosmos 27 ( meaning &quot;Cosmos 27&quot;), also known as Zond 3MV-1 No.3 was a space mission intended as a Venus impact probe. The spacecraft was launched by a Molniya 8K78 carrier rocket from Baikonur. The Blok L stage and probe reached Earth orbit successfully, but the attitude control system failed to operate.

== Launch ==

Kosmos 27 was launched at 03:24:43 GMT on 27 March 1964, atop a Molniya 8K78 s/n T15000-27 carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.

== Spacecraft ==

Kosmos 27 was a &quot;third-generation&quot; deep space planetary probes of the 3MV series of the Soviet Union. The Soviet engineers planned four types of the 3MV, the 3MV-1 (for Venus impact), 3MV-2 (for Venus flyby), 3MV-3 (for Mars impact), and 3MV-4 (for Mars flyby). The primary difference over the second-generation was vastly improved (and in many cases doubled) orientation system elements as well as improved onboard propulsion systems. While these four versions were meant to study Mars and Venus.

== Mission ==

The probe was the first dedicated 3MV spacecraft that the Soviets launched (earlier missions had been of the test &quot;Object-Probe&quot; versions as Kosmos 21). It was designed to accomplish atmospheric entry into Venus followed by descent and impact. On 27 March 1964, it had a perigee of and an apogee of , with an inclination of 64.8° and an orbital period of 88.7 minutes. The spacecraft successfully reached Earth orbit but failed to leave for Venus when the Blok L upper stage malfunctioned. The upper stage lost stable attitude due to a failure in the circuit of the power supply circuit that powered the valves for the attitude control system; hence, the stage remained uncontrollable and not ready to initiate a burn to leave Earth orbit. The problem was traced to a design error, the examination of telemetry data found that the failure was due to a design flaw in the circuitry of the BOZ unit, which resulted in power not being transferred to the attitude control jets on the Blok L stage, rather than one related to quality control. The spacecraft burned up in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere the following day, on 28 March 1964. If successful, this mission would have been given a &quot;Venera&quot; designation.

<text>Olokun (Yoruba: Olókun) is an orisha spirit in Yoruba religion. Olokun is believed to be the parent of Aje, the orisha of great wealth and of the bottom of the ocean. Olokun is revered as the ruler of all bodies of water and for the authority over other water deities. Olokun is highly praised for their ability to give great wealth, health, and prosperity to their followers. Communities in both West Africa and the African diaspora view Olokun variously as female, male, or androgynous.

==West Africa==
Water deities are &quot;ubiquitous and vitally important in southern Nigeria&quot;; Olókun worship is especially noted in the cities of the Yoruba and Edo people in southwest Nigeria. In West African areas directly adjacent to the coast, Olokun takes a male form among his worshipers, while in the hinterland, Olokun is a female deity.

According to Yoruba traditions about their divine dynasty, Olokun - in her female incarnation - was the senior wife of Emperor Oduduwa. Her rivalry with one of his other wives is said to have led to her manifesting the Atlantic Ocean.

==Candomblé==
In the Candomblé religion of Brazil, Olokun is venerated as the mother of Yemoja and the owner of the sea. She is recognized in Candomblé terreiros, but not during celebrations. In this respect, Olokun is similar to Odudua and Orunmilá; they held great importance in West Africa but play a minor role in Afro-Brazilian religion. There are no &quot;xirê&quot; chants dedicated to Olokun as with other orixás. Candomblé initiates recognize the divinity of Olokun but do not hold her as a personal deity. The veneration of Olokun has been revived in the late 20th and early 21st century through visits to Brazil by West African priests.

Olokun is celebrated during the Festival of Yemoja (&quot;Festa de Iemanjá&quot;).

==Santería==
Olokun is an orisha in the religion of Santería. Olokun is an androgynous orisha, meaning Olokun is a man and a woman, depending on if it is the Olokun of Ifá or the Olokun of Ocha.

==Pataki==
According to &quot;The Book Of Ifá&quot;, Olokun became enraged and rose to the surface. As Olokun did this to drown the humans, the orishas went to Orunmila to ask him what to do. Orunmila told them that Ogun needed to create the longest chain he could possibly create. It was ultimately Obatala who had the responsibility of imprisoning Olokun in their domain. Knowing this, Obatala went to Ogun and asked him to make the chain and so he did. Obatala then went down into the ocean and trapped Olokun with it.

<text>Obatala is an orisha in the Yoruba religion that is believed to have been given the task to create the Earth but failed the task by being drunk on palm wine and was outperformed by his little brother Oduduwa. He was instead given the job of creating human beings. This was authorized by his father, Olodumare which gave Obatala the name sculptor of mankind. &quot;Now Olodumare [the supreme being] once called on Obatala and told him that he would love him to assist in creating human beings that would live in the world he was about to create. This is because as he (Olodumare) said further he would not like the world he was planning to create to exist without human beings.&quot;
Obatala had worked on his task with the assistance of Oshun. He is believed to be successful at creating human beings with water and clay, but during the creation phase he had become drunk with palm wine due to thirst. This caused him to create human beings with disabilities. When he became sober and saw his mistake, he vowed to never drink again and reinvented himself as &quot;The Great White God&quot;, protector of people with disabilities. Due to this reinvention, he was given ascendance over human beings.

According to the oral traditions of Ife, the mortal Obatala was the founder and king of Ife during its classical period. His position as the King was challenged by Oduduwa who assumed leadership of the town for a brief moment. However, Obatala was able to emerge victorious in the contest and it led to the murder of his rival Oduduwa and the retrieval of his throne.

While there exists an Obatala in the Yoruba pantheon, the understanding of the qualities of the Obatala god was merged into the human Obatala that ruled in Ife upon his posthumous deification. Thus, the human Obatala who was the king at Ife was admitted to the Yoruba pantheon as an aspect of the primordial divinity of the same name.

== Mythology ==
According to Yoruba mythology, Obatala is the oldest of all of the orishas and was granted authority to create the Earth. Due to Obatala being drunk, Oduduwa took this opportunity to show his worth to his father. He took the satchel that Olodumare had given Obatala to aid him in creation and used it to create land on the primeval ocean. Oduduwa did such a great job that Olodumare granted him the title &quot;God of the Earth.&quot;

Obatala was then given the task to create human beings. With this task he took a &quot;long gold chain, a snail&#x27;s shell filled with sand, a white hen, a black cat, and a palm nut&quot; and climbed down to the end of the chain.

He released the white hen which spread the sand from the shell onto the ocean to create mountains and valleys. He also planted the palm nut to create a forest.

After being content with what he created, he started to mold human beings from clay. During this creative progress, he was drinking a large amount of palm wine, created from the palm nut forest, which caused him to create deformed figures in his drunken state.

When he became sober and realized what he had done, he vowed to never drink again and protect people with disabilities.

After he successfully created the human being figures, they were given ase, a copper knife, and a wooden hoe. They were able to prosper.

== In Africa ==
===Primordial Obatala===
According to the tenets of the Yoruba religion, Obatala is the oldest of all of the orishas and was granted authority to create the Earth. A tradition states that before he could return to heaven and report to Olodumare, Oduduwa usurped his responsibility (due to Obatala&#x27;s being drunk at the time). He took the satchel that Olodumare had given Obatala to aid him in creation and used it to create land on the primeval ocean. A great feud ensued between the two siblings. However, an assessment of Yoruba traditional religion shows that each of the 201 deity are understood by their descendants and adherents to have carried out the creation of the earth. This suggests the beginning of the world is an aspect of Yoruba cosmogenesis associated with numerous deities in Yoruba pantheons beyond Obatala or Oduduwa.

===Mortal Obatala===
Oba Obatala was the founder and the King of Ile-Ife, hence the appellation, Olufe. His reign was disrupted by an usurpation led by Oduduwa and his supporters such as Obameri, Obadio, Aloran, Ejio and Apata. However, Obatala was able to facilitate the death of Oduduwa and retrieve his throne as the king of Ile-Ife with the assistance of his support base consisting of Oluorogbo, Orunmila, Akire, Obalufon Ogbogboinrin (Obamakin), Owa Ilare and numerous others. This is re-enacted every year in the Obatala festival in Ife and the coronation rites of Ooni which indicate Obatala&#x27;s ownership of the crown, throne and authority. Ultimately, following the war between Obatala on the one hand and Oduduwa on the other, the latter lost and his support base dispersed, leading to a rotated rulership between the lineages of Obatala and Obalufon Ogbogbodinrin (Obamakin) who succeeded him. This was in effect till a coup conducted by Lajamisan, a descendant of Oranfe, disrupted the ruling structure.

==In the Americas==
===Santería===
Obatalá is the oldest &quot;orisha fúnfún&quot; (&quot;white deity&quot;), referring to purity, both physically and symbolically as in the &quot;light&quot; of consciousness. In Santería, Obatalá is syncretized with Our Lady of Mercy and Jesus Of Nazareth. Obatalá is said to have an equal number of male paths as female paths, but more often crowns women in part because men are traditionally crowned in Ifá in many lineages.

===Candomblé===
In Candomblé, Oxalá (Obatalá) has been syncretized with Our Lord of Bonfim; in that role, he is the patron saint of Bahia. The extensive use of white clothing, which is associated with the worship of Oxalá, has become a symbol of Candomblé in general. Friday is the day dedicated to the worship of Oxalá. A large syncretic religious celebration of the Festa do Bonfim in January in Salvador celebrates both Oxalá and Our Lord of Bonfim; it includes the washing of the church steps with a special water, made with flowers.

===Snails===
The snail &quot;Achatina fulica&quot; is used for religious purposes in Brazil as an offering to Obatala. It is seen as a substitute for the African giant snail (&quot;Archachatina marginata&quot;) that is used in Yorubaland because they are known by the same name (&quot;Igbin&quot;, also known as &quot;Ibi&quot;) in both Brazil and Yorubaland.

== Offerings and rituals ==
In terms of offering to orishas, Female orishas (Iabás) &quot;eat&quot; female animals, while male Orishas (Borós) &quot;eat&quot; male animals. However, Obatala is the only male orisha who &quot;eats&quot; in the Iabás circle, thus accepting sacrifices of female animals in his honor. Bastide, commented on the androgynous characteristics of Obatala as an explanation of why this orisha accepts female animals as offerings. According to some priests, however, Obatala does not have a sex, since, according to the myths, he is the Father of Creation. Obatala is therefore the equivalent of God in the catholic syncretism who also does not have a specific sex.

Unlike other Orisha, Obatala only accepts offerings cooked in honey, as he has a distaste for dende oil.

Like any other Orisha, Obatala does not specifically eat the offering himself, but consumes the energy of the offering, or Axé. The expression &quot;eat&quot; is used as a symbolism for a spiritual form of feeding. Orishas do not &quot;come down&quot; from the spiritual plane to eat (literally speaking) the animal being offered.

Traditionally speaking, for sacrificial offerings to Obatala, considered an orixá-funfun (literally &quot;white orisha&quot;), the animals or their parts should be completely white, such as the white blood of the mollusk called Igbin (Achatina fulica).

<doc id="99372" wikidata="Q59996" url="?curid=99372" title="Robin (character)">
<text>Robin is the alias of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Bob Kane, Bill Finger, and Jerry Robinson to serve as a junior counterpart and the sidekick to the superhero Batman. As a team, Batman and Robin have commonly been referred to as the &quot;Caped Crusaders&quot; and the &quot;Dynamic Duo&quot;. The character&#x27;s first incarnation, Dick Grayson, debuted in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #38 (April 1940). Conceived as a way to attract young readership, Robin garnered overwhelmingly positive critical reception, doubling the sales of the Batman titles. Robin&#x27;s early adventures included &quot;Star Spangled Comics&quot; #65–130 (1947–1952), the character&#x27;s first solo feature. He made regular appearances in Batman-related comic books and other DC Comics publications from 1940 through the early 1980s, until the character set aside the Robin identity and became the independent superhero Nightwing.

The character&#x27;s second incarnation, Jason Todd, first appeared in &quot;Batman&quot; #357 (1983). He made regular appearances in Batman-related comic books until 1988, when he was murdered by the Joker in the storyline &quot;&quot;. Jason later found himself alive after a reality-changing incident, eventually becoming the Red Hood. The premiere &quot;Robin&quot; limited series was published in 1991, featuring the character&#x27;s third incarnation, Tim Drake, training to earn the role of Batman&#x27;s vigilante partner. After two successful sequels, the monthly &quot;Robin&quot; series began in 1993 and ended in early 2009, which also helped his transition from sidekick to a superhero in his own right. In 2004 storylines, established DC Comics character Stephanie Brown became the fourth Robin for a short time before the role reverted to Tim Drake. Damian Wayne succeeds Drake as Robin in the 2009 story arc &quot;.&quot;

The current and former Robins always feature prominently in Batman&#x27;s cast of supporting heroes; Dick, Jason, Tim, and Damian all regard him as a father. In current continuity as of 2025, Dick Grayson serves as Nightwing, Jason Todd is the Red Hood, Stephanie Brown is Batgirl, while Tim Drake and Damian both share the title of Robin. In recent years, Batman has also adopted new sidekicks in the form of Bluebird, whose name references Robin, and The Signal.

==Creation==

About a year after Batman&#x27;s debut, Batman creators Bob Kane and Bill Finger introduced Robin the Boy Wonder in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #38 (1940). The name &quot;Robin the Boy Wonder&quot; and the medieval look of the original costume were inspired by Robin Hood. Jerry Robinson noted he &quot;came up with Robin because the adventures of Robin Hood were boyhood favorites of mine. I had been given a Robin Hood book illustrated by N. C. Wyeth ... and that&#x27;s what I quickly sketched out when I suggested the name Robin Hood, which they seemed to like, and then showed them the costume. And if you look at it, it&#x27;s Wyeth&#x27;s costume, from my memory, because I didn&#x27;t have the book to look at.&quot; Although Robin is best known as Batman&#x27;s sidekick, the Robins have also been members of the superhero groups the Teen Titans (with the original Robin, Dick Grayson, as a founding member and the latter group&#x27;s leader) and Young Justice.

In Batman stories, the character of Robin was intended to be Batman&#x27;s Watson: Bill Finger, writer for many early Batman adventures, said:
&quot;Robin was an outgrowth of a conversation I had with Bob. As I said, Batman was a combination of Douglas Fairbanks and Sherlock Holmes. Holmes had his Watson. The thing that bothered me was that Batman didn&#x27;t have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always having him thinking. I found that as I went along Batman needed a Watson to talk to. That&#x27;s how Robin came to be. Bob called me over and said he was going to put a boy in the strip to identify with Batman. I thought it was a great idea.&quot;
==Fictional character biography==
The following fictional characters have assumed the Robin role at various times in the main continuity:

===Dick Grayson===
In the comics, Dick Grayson was an 8-year-old acrobat and the youngest of a family act called the &quot;Flying Graysons&quot;. A gangster named Boss Zucco, loosely based on actor Edward G. Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Little Caesar&quot; character, had been extorting money from the circus and killed Grayson&#x27;s parents, John and Mary, by sabotaging their trapeze equipment as a warning against defiance. Batman investigated the crime and, as his alter ego billionaire Bruce Wayne, had Dick put under his custody as a legal ward. Together they investigated Zucco and collected the evidence needed to bring him to justice. From his debut appearance in 1940 through 1969, Robin was known as the Boy Wonder. Batman creates a costume for Dick, consisting of a red tunic, yellow cape, green gloves, green boots, green spandex briefs, and a utility belt. As he grew older, graduated from high school, and enrolled in Hudson University, Robin continued his career as the Teen Wonder, from 1970 into the early 1980s.

The character was rediscovered by a new generation of fans during the 1980s because of the success of &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot;, in which he left Batman&#x27;s shadow entirely to assume the identity of Nightwing. He aids Batman throughout the later storyline regarding the several conflicts with Jason Todd until he makes his final return as the &quot;Red Hood&quot;. Grayson temporarily took over as Batman (while Wayne was traveling through time), using the aid of Damian Wayne, making his newish appearance as &quot;Robin&quot;, to defeat and imprison Todd. With Bruce Wayne&#x27;s return, Grayson went back to being Nightwing.

===Jason Todd===


DC was initially hesitant to turn Grayson into Nightwing and to replace him with a new Robin. To minimize the change, they made the new Robin, Jason Todd, who first appeared in &quot;Batman&quot; #357 (1983), similar to a young Grayson. Like Dick Grayson, Jason Todd was the son of circus acrobats murdered by a criminal (this time the Batman adversary Killer Croc), and then adopted by Bruce Wayne. In this incarnation, he was originally red-haired and unfailingly cheerful, and wore his circus costume to fight crime until Dick Grayson presented him with a Robin suit of his own. At that point, he dyed his hair black.

After the miniseries &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, much of the DC Comics continuity was redone. Dick Grayson&#x27;s origin, years with Batman, and growth into Nightwing remained mostly unchanged; but Todd&#x27;s character was completely revised. He was now a black-haired street orphan who first encountered Batman when he attempted to steal tires from the Batmobile. Batman saw to it that he was placed in a school for troubled youths. Weeks later, after Dick Grayson became Nightwing and Todd proved his crime-fighting worth by helping Batman catch a gang of robbers, Batman offered Todd the position as Robin.

Believing that readers never truly bonded with Todd, DC Comics made the controversial decision in 1988 to poll readers using a 1-900 number as to whether or not Todd should be killed. The event received more attention in the mainstream media than any other comic book event before it. Readers voted &quot;yes&quot; by a small margin (5,343 to 5,271) and Todd was subsequently murdered by the Joker in the storyline, &quot;&quot;, in which the psychopath beat the youngster severely with a crowbar, and left him to die in a warehouse rigged with a bomb.

Jason Todd later returned as the new Red Hood (the original alias of the Joker) when he was brought back to life due to reality being altered. After the continuity changes following the New 52 DC Comics relaunch, Jason becomes a leader of the Outlaws, a superhero team that includes Starfire and Arsenal who had spent years with Grayson in the Titans.

===Tim Drake===
DC Comics was left uncertain about readers&#x27; decision to have Jason Todd killed, wondering if readers preferred Batman as a lone vigilante, disliked Todd specifically, or just wanted to see if DC would actually kill off the character. In addition, the 1989 &quot;Batman&quot; film did not feature Robin, giving DC a reason to keep him out of the comic book series for marketing purposes. Regardless, Batman editor Dennis O&#x27;Neil introduced a new Robin. The third Robin, Timothy Drake, first appeared in a flashback in &quot;Batman&quot; #436 (1989) as a preadolescent boy, introduced by writer Marv Wolfman, interior penciler Pat Broderick, and inker John Beatty. Drake&#x27;s first name was a nod to Tim Burton, director of the 1989 &quot;Batman&quot; film. The character first donned the Robin costume, and became associated with the third version of Robin, in the acclaimed &quot;A Lonely Place of Dying&quot; sequel storyline, which culminated in issue #442, written by Marv Wolfman with cover art by George Pérez, storyline interior pencils by Pérez, Tom Grummett, as well as Jim Aparo, and inks by Mike DeCarlo. In addition to establishing Tim Drake as a principal character in &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, Lauren R. O&#x27;Connor argues that &quot;A Lonely Place of Dying&quot; served as the denouement of a transition from Dick Grayson&#x27;s &quot;absent sexuality,&quot; which earlier incited reader interpretations of homosexuality, to definitive heterosexual presence as a maturation narrative. O&#x27;Connor offers multiple examples from this 1989 storyline, such as Drake&#x27;s encounter with Starfire and Grayson&#x27;s heeding of Drake&#x27;s concerns over Batman&#x27;s psychology, to substantiate the notion of a heterosexual &quot;bildungsroman&quot; subplot.

The ensuing Tim Drake storylines, authored by Alan Grant and penciled by Norm Breyfogle, coupled with the 1989 release of Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot;, spurred sales of both comic book titles &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot;. For the latter, Grant attested in 2007 that &quot;when the &quot;Batman&quot; movie came out, the sales went up, if I recall correctly, from around 75,000 to about 675,000.&quot; 1989–90 was indeed the &quot;Year of the Bat:&quot; Capital and Diamond City Distributors reported that the &quot;&quot;-inspired &quot;&quot; dominated four out of the five spots for preorders (&quot;not&quot; total sales and second printings). The only exception was the third preorder spot, snagged by &quot;Batman&quot; #442, the conclusion to Tim Drake&#x27;s &quot;A Lonely Place of Dying&quot; storyline. The &quot;Year of the Bat&quot; continued into the first half of 1990. Preorders for &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot; issues featuring a revived Joker and Penguin began to compete with, and even edged out, the last three parts of Grant Morrison&#x27;s and Klaus Janson&#x27;s &quot;&quot; storyline in &quot;Legends&quot;. Todd McFarlane&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; arrived in the second half of 1990, inaugurating six months of Spidermania (or Mcfarlamania, depending on the reader). DC closed out 1990 with vendors under-ordering issues, prompting the publisher to push &quot;Batman&quot; #457 and the first part of the &quot;Robin&quot; mini-series into second and then third printings. The next year, 1991, witnessed the ascension of Chris Claremont&#x27;s, Jim Lee&#x27;s, and Scott Williams&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; against Magneto, as well as Fabian Nicieza&#x27;s and Rob Liefeld&#x27;s &quot;X-Force&quot;, into the top of the preorder rankings. The only exception to this X-mania was, again, Tim Drake and the sequel to the &quot;Robin&quot; miniseries, the first variant issue of which garnered the third spot, firmly wedged between variant issues of &quot;X-Force&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot;. The mini-series pitted solo Robin against the Joker, in response to fan demands for a matchup since &quot;A Death in the Family.&quot; The 1990s comic booming bust had begun. In a supplemental interview with Daniel Best, Alan Grant added that &quot;every issue from about that time [after the &#x27;Year of the Bat&#x27;] that featured Robin sales went up because Robin did have his own fans.&quot; Although both Grant and Breyfogle initially believed that their &quot;Anarky&quot; character could potentially become the third version of Robin, they were quick to support the editorial decision to focus on Drake. The social anarchist duo adopted the character as their own in the early 1990s, during Grant&#x27;s shift to libertarian socialism but before his late 1990s emphasis on Neo Tech. Breyfogle agreed that &quot;it was a big thing to bring in the new Robin, yes. I know my fans often point specifically to that double page splash where his costume first appears as a big event for them as fans and I usually have to point out to them that Neal Adams was the one who designed the costume. The &#x27;R&#x27; symbol and the staff were all that was really mine.&quot; In the &quot;Rite of Passage&quot; storyline for &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, Grant and Breyfogle intertwined 1) Drake matching wits with Anarky; 2) a criminal and anthropological investigation into an apocryphal Haitian &quot;vodou&quot; cult (revealed by Batman, asserting anthropological and investigative authority, as a front for extortion and crony capitalism); 3) the murder of Drake&#x27;s mother by vilified cult leaders; 4) the beginning of Drake&#x27;s recurrent nightmares and trauma; as well as 5) the perspective of a child of one of the cult&#x27;s Haitian followers, unknowingly and inadvertently orphaned by Batman at the end of the four-issue arc.

Tim Drake eventually transitioned from late preadolescence to adolescence, becoming the third Robin over the course of the storylines &quot;Rite of Passage&quot; and &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, with all issues scripted by Alan Grant and penciled by Norm Breyfogle. Story arcs that included Drake only in subplots or featured his training in criminal investigation, such as &quot;Crimesmith&quot; and &quot;The Penguin Affair,&quot; were either written or co-written by Grant and Wolfman, with pencils by Breyfogle, Aparo, and M. D. Bright. Immediately afterwards, the character starred in the five-issue miniseries &quot;Robin,&quot; written by Chuck Dixon, with interior pencils by Tom Lyle and cover art by Brian Bolland. The new Batman and Robin team went on their first official mission together in the story &quot;Debut&quot;, again written by Grant and penciled by Breyfogle. Lauren R. O&#x27;Connor contends that, in early Tim Drake appearances, writers such as Grant and Chuck Dixon &quot;had a lexicon of teenage behavior from which to draw, unlike when Dick Grayson was introduced and the concept of the teenager was still nascent. They wisely mobilized the expected adolescent behaviors of parental conflict, hormonal urges, and identity formation to give Tim emotional depth and complexity, making him a relatable character with boundaries between his two selves.&quot; In the &quot;Robin&quot; ongoing series, when Drake had fully transitioned into an adolescent character, Chuck Dixon depicted him as engaging in adolescent intimacy, yet still stopped short at overt heterosexual consummation. This narrative benchmark maintained Robin&#x27;s &quot;estrangement from sex&quot; that began in the Grayson years. Erica McCrystal likewise observes that Alan Grant, prior to Dixon&#x27;s series, connected Drake to Batman&#x27;s philosophy of heroic or anti-heroic &quot;vigilantism&quot; as &quot;therapeutic for children of trauma. But this kind of therapy has a delicate integration process.&quot; The overcoming of trauma entailed distinct identity intersections and emotional restraint, as well as a &quot;complete understanding&quot; of symbol and self. Bruce Wayne, a former child of trauma, guided &quot;other trauma victims down a path of righteousness.&quot; Tim Drake, for example, endured trauma and &quot;emotional duress&quot; as a result of the death of his mother (father in a coma and on a ventilator). Drake contemplated the idea of fear, and overcoming it, in both the &quot;Rite of Passage&quot; and &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; storylines. Grant and Breyfogle subjected Drake to recurrent nightmares, from hauntings by a ghoulish Batman to the disquieting lullaby (or informal nursery rhyme), &quot;My Mummy&#x27;s dead...My Mummy&#x27;s Dead...I can&#x27;t get it through my head,&quot; echoing across a cemetery for deceased parents. Drake ultimately defeated his own preadolescent fears &quot;somewhat distant from Bruce Wayne&quot; and &quot;not as an orphan.&quot; By the end of &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, an adolescent Drake had &quot;proven himself as capable of being a vigilante&quot; by deducing the role of fear in instigating a series of violent crimes.

In the comics, Tim Drake was a late preadolescent boy who had followed the adventures of Batman and Robin ever since witnessing the murder of the Flying Graysons. This served to connect Drake to Grayson, establishing a link that DC hoped would help readers accept this new Robin. Drake surmised their secret identities with his amateur but instinctive detective skills and followed their careers closely. Tim stated on numerous occasions that he wishes to become &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Detective&quot;, a title currently belonging to the Dark Knight. Batman himself stated that one day Drake will surpass him as a detective. Despite his combat skills not being the match of Grayson&#x27;s (although there are some similarities, in that they are far superior to Todd&#x27;s when he was Robin), his detective skills more than make up for this. In addition, Batman supplied him with a new armored costume for his transition to the adolescent Robin.

Tim Drake&#x27;s first Robin costume had a red torso, yellow stitching and belt, black boots, and green short sleeves, gloves, pants, and domino mask. He wore a cape that was black on the outside and yellow on the inside. This costume had an armored tunic and gorget, an emergency &quot;R&quot; shuriken on his chest in addition to the traditional batarangs and a collapsible bo staff as his primary weapon, which Tim Drake continues to use as the superhero Red Robin. Neal Adams redesigned the entire costume with the exception of the &quot;R&quot; shuriken logo, first sketched by Norm Breyfogle.

Tim Drake is the first Robin to have his own comic book series, where he fought crime on his own. Tim Drake, as Robin, co-founded the superhero team Young Justice in the absence of the Teen Titans of Dick Grayson&#x27;s generation, but would then later re-form the Teen Titans after Young Justice disbanded following a massive &quot;sidekick crossover&quot; during which Donna Troy was killed. Tim served as leader of this version of the Titans until 2009, at which point he quit due to the events of &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot;

Following &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and &quot;52&quot;, Tim Drake modified his costume to favor a mostly red and black color scheme in tribute to his best friend, Superboy (Kon-El), who died fighting Earth-Prime Superboy. This Robin costume had a red torso, long sleeves, and pants. It also included black gloves and boots, yellow stitching and belt, and a black and yellow cape. Tim Drake continued the motif of a red and black costume when he assumed the role of Red Robin before and during the events of &quot;The New 52&quot;.

Tim Drake assumes the identity of the Red Robin after Batman&#x27;s disappearance following the events of &quot;Final Crisis&quot; and &quot;&quot; and Damian Wayne becoming Grayson&#x27;s Robin. Following 2011&#x27;s continuity changes resulting from &quot;The New 52&quot; DC Comics relaunch, history was altered such that Tim Drake never took up the Robin mantle after Jason Todd&#x27;s death, feeling that it would be inappropriate. Instead, he served as Batman&#x27;s sidekick under the name of the Red Robin. However, in DC&#x27;s &quot;Rebirth&quot; relaunch, his original origin was restored.

In 2020s comics tying in with DC&#x27;s &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; era, Drake returns to the Robin mantle as Batman&#x27;s primary crime-fighting partner when Damian goes on a soul-searching journey. Meanwhile, in his solo adventures, he goes on his own soul-searching journey, and reconnects with his old friend Bernard Dowd, whom he begins to date. Tim later comes out to Batman and is accepted. His solo series &quot;Tim Drake: Robin&quot; explores a young adult Tim living alone at the marina, developing a closer relationship with Bernard, and adopting his own crime-fighting partner in the form of Sparrow (Darcy Thomas), a former member of the &quot;We Are Robin&quot; movement.

===Stephanie Brown===
Stephanie Brown, Tim Drake&#x27;s girlfriend and the costumed adventurer previously known as the Spoiler, volunteered for the role of Robin upon Tim&#x27;s resignation. Batman fired the Girl Wonder for not obeying his orders to the letter on two occasions. Stephanie then stole one of Batman&#x27;s incomplete plans to control Gotham&#x27;s crime and executed it. Trying to prove her worthiness, Brown inadvertently set off a gang war on the streets of Gotham. While trying to help end the war, Brown was captured and tortured by the lunatic crime boss Black Mask. She managed to escape, but apparently died shortly afterwards due to the severity of her injuries. Tim Drake keeps a memorial for her in his cave hideout underneath Titans Tower in San Francisco. She appeared alive and stalking Tim, after his return from traveling around the globe with his mentor. It turned out that Dr. Leslie Thompkins had faked Stephanie&#x27;s death in an effort to protect her. For years she operated on and off as the Spoiler, but was then recruited as Barbara Gordon&#x27;s replacement as Batgirl. She had her own series, as well as making appearances throughout various Batman and Batman spin-off series. Her time as the Spoiler, Robin, and Batgirl was retconned to have never occurred after the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; event, with her being reintroduced having just become the Spoiler in &quot;Batman Eternal&quot;. However, her history as Robin was later restored.

===Damian Wayne===
Damian Wayne was the child of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul, thus the grandson of the immortal Ra&#x27;s al Ghul. Batman was unaware of his son&#x27;s existence for years until Talia left Damian in his care. Damian was violent and lacking in discipline and morality, and was trained by the League of Assassins. Learning to kill at a young age, Damian&#x27;s murderous behavior created a troubled relationship with his father, who vowed never to take a life.

Conceived to become a host for his maternal grandfather&#x27;s soul as well as a pawn against the Dark Knight, Batman saved his child from this fate, which forced Ra&#x27;s to inhabit his own son&#x27;s body, and thus, Damian was affectionate to his father. After Batman&#x27;s apparent death during &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Talia left her son under Dick Grayson and Alfred Pennyworth&#x27;s care and Damian was deeply affected by his father&#x27;s absence. In the first issue of &quot;Battle for the Cowl&quot;, Damian was driving the Batmobile and was attacked by Poison Ivy and Killer Croc. Damian was rescued by Nightwing, who then tries to escape, but was shot down by Black Mask&#x27;s men. Nightwing tried to fight the thugs, but the thugs were shot by Jason Todd. After a fight between Nightwing and Todd, Todd eventually shot Damian in the chest. In the final issue of the series, Alfred made Damian into Robin. Damian&#x27;s first task as Robin was to rescue Tim. After &quot;Battle for the Cowl&quot;, Grayson adopted the mantle of Batman, and instead of having Tim (whom he viewed as an equal rather than a protégé) remain as Robin, he gave the role to Damian, who he felt needed the training that his father would have given him.

Following the &quot;&quot; and &quot;Flashpoint&quot; events, Bruce Wayne returned to his role as Batman, while Dick resumed as Nightwing. As of &quot;The New 52&quot;, Damian continued to work with his father, but temporarily gave up being Robin (as his mother had put a price on his head), and went under the identity of Red Bird. Damian met his end at the hands of the Heretic, an aged clone of Damian working for Leviathan, bravely giving up his life. Despite his status as deceased, Damian starred in his own miniseries, &quot;Damian: Son of Batman&quot;, written and drawn by Andy Kubert, set in a future where Damian is on the path to become Batman after his father fell victim to a trap set by the Joker. Batman eventually started a difficult quest to resurrect him, returning Damian to life with Darkseid&#x27;s Chaos Shard.

===Clone of Bruce Wayne===
Failsafe created a clone of Bruce Wayne to serve as his Robin of Zur-En-Arrh in retaliation for Damian Wayne rejecting him. To make sure the clone didn&#x27;t turn against him, Failsafe made it start to rapidly age. Robin got away following Failsafe&#x27;s defeat. With his memories awakeneing, Robin made his way to Crime Alley to attack any criminals that entered there. Batman and Mister Terrific arrived to confront him. When Robin reached Batman&#x27;s age, he severed his right hand so that it can be transplanted onto Batman. When Robin became elderly, he was taken to see the graves to Thomas Wayne, Martha Wayne, and Alfred Pennyworth until he died peacefully in Batman&#x27;s presence. Batman buried his clone on the property of Pennyworth Manor.

==Other versions==
===Batman Beyond===
In &quot;Future&#x27;s End&quot; and &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Terry McGinnis&#x27;s brother Matt becomes Robin to save his brother from the villain Payback. Initially excited about the role, Matt was eventually asked to stop being Robin after his encounter with the Joker.

===Batman: Digital Justice===
In the digitally rendered tale &quot;&quot;, James Gordon, the grandson of his namesake, Commissioner Gordon, takes on the mantle of the Batman. A character named Robert Chang, who is somewhat reminiscent of the post-Crisis Jason Todd, takes on the mantle of Robin.

===Batman &#x27;89: Drake Winston===
In 2021, DC published &quot;Batman &#x27;89&quot;, a limited series that served as a continuation of Tim Burton&#x27;s Batman films &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, ignoring the subsequent films &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995) and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997), in which actor Michael Keaton did not appear following Burton&#x27;s departure from the franchise. This series featured a new version of Robin named Drake Winston (whose appearance is inspired by Marlon Wayans, who was originally attached to play the role in the Burton films). Winston is a mechanic who works at Royal Autobody, an auto shop in Burnside owned by Harvey Dent&#x27;s childhood mentor, Jerome Otis. His ancestors had their own automotive company that was acquired by Bruce Wayne&#x27;s great-grandfather in a forced buyout. He strongly dislikes cops and authority figures and dresses up as a masked vigilante at night to help the residents of his neighborhood. He is initially distrustful of both Bruce Wayne and Batman, but after witnessing his dedication towards helping people and figuring out they are the same person, the two become partners and work together to stop Dent and arsonists terrorizing the city.

===Dick Grayson (Earth Two)===

The Robin of Earth-Two is a parallel version of the fictional DC Comics superhero, who was ntroduced after DC Comics created Earth-Two, a parallel world that was retroactively established as the home of characters which had been published in the Golden Age of comic books. This allowed creators to publish comic books featuring Robin while being able to disregard Golden Age stories, solving an incongruity, as Robin had been published as a single ongoing incarnation since inception.

Robin&#x27;s history is the same as his mainline counterpart, but does not occur in a floating timeline. In &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Robin is killed by the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s Shadow Demons. However, a version of him is restored when the multiverse is recreated in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;.
===Talon (Earth-3)===

The second Talon is a fictional character shown in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #38 (2006), the former sidekick of Owlman, created by Geoff Johns and Tony S. Daniel. He is a former member of the Crime Society and a member of the Teen Titans during the one-year gap after &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. According to an interview with Tony Daniel at Newsarama, Talon is supposed to look like his mentor Owlman. He briefly battled Black Adam with his fellow Titans during World War III. It was revealed in &quot;The Search for Ray Palmer: Crime Society&quot; that there have been several Talons. The first one is shown dressed parallel to that of Grayson&#x27;s classic Robin costume, including brown pixie boots. On post-Crisis Earth-3, the Teen Titans&#x27; Talon and Duela Dent, the daughter of the Jokester, had been dating. When Duela revealed their relationship to her parents, her father denounced her and the two fled. It is unknown how the two managed to flee to New Earth, or what has happened to Talon beyond that.

===Bruce Wayne Junior===
In &quot;The Second Batman and Robin Team&quot; (&quot;Batman&quot; #131, April 1960), Bruce Wayne&#x27;s butler Alfred writes a story about the possible future of Batman and Robin. In it, Bruce Wayne marries Kathy Kane (Batwoman) and they have a son named Bruce Jr. When Wayne retires as Batman, Dick Grayson takes over the role of the Caped Crusader. Bruce Jr., having secretly trained on his own, volunteers to become the new Robin, despite objections from his mother. As Robin II, he fights alongside Batman II. Several subsequent &quot;imaginary stories&quot; featuring Bruce Jr. followed; the last in this series was &quot;Bat-Girl—Batwoman II&quot; in &quot;Batman&quot; #163 (May 1964). Bruce Wayne Jr next appeared in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #215 (January 1973) as one of the Super-Sons.

Grant Morrison used the Bruce Wayne Jr. character in &quot;JLA&quot; #9 (September 1997), in the story &quot;Elseworlds.&quot; After the supervillain Key traps the Justice Leaguers in dream worlds, Batman dreams of a future in which he is married to Selina Kyle/Catwoman. They have a son named Bruce Junior, who was raised from birth to be a superhero and serves as Robin II alongside a Tim Drake Batman.

John Byrne created his own Bruce Jr. in the epilogue of the &quot;Batman/Captain America&quot; crossover from 1996; this Robin is a red-head and resembles a male Carrie Kelley. Captain America wakes up in modern times after having been frozen in ice towards the end of World War II. He reunites with Batman, a friend who had helped him when Joker and Red Skull joined forces. Cap is amazed to learn that in the time he slept, Bruce Wayne has retired from being Batman, has passed the mantle to Dick Grayson and that his son Bruce Junior is the new Robin.

Byrne revisited Bruce Jr. in his &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&quot; series. There, Bruce Junior is son of Bruce Senior and his wife, who is never identified but is implied to be Julie Madison. &quot;BJ&quot; greatly desires to be a hero and trains in the hopes of following in his father&#x27;s footsteps. His mother refuses to let BJ become Robin until he turns eighteen. On Halloween night of 1964, when BJ is fifteen, he and Superman&#x27;s daughter Kara (Supergirl) sneak out to have an adventure and, with the help of Wonder Woman&#x27;s daughter Wonder Girl and The Flash&#x27;s nephew Kid Flash join forces to defeat some of Flash&#x27;s Rogue&#x27;s Gallery. Afterward they decide to form their own team called the Justice League. BJ and Kara become romantically involved as adults, but BJ puts the relationship on hold when Joker kills Dick, forcing him to become the third Batman. BJ and Kara eventually marry, but their wedding is halted by Kara&#x27;s brother Joel Kent. Joel, who had been manipulated his whole life by Lex Luthor to hate his family, kills Kara by punching through her chest. Joel dies shortly thereafter, and BJ agrees to raise his powerless son in order to prevent another such tragedy from happening (he also marries Joel&#x27;s widow, Mei-Lai, sometime in the intervening years). The child, named Clark Wayne, becomes BJ&#x27;s Robin and is offered the mantle of Batman when he becomes an adult. Clark turns it down, having deduced that he isn&#x27;t BJ&#x27;s biological son, and believing that only a real Wayne should be Batman, instead adopts the identity of Knightwing. In the 1990s, BJ goes on a quest to locate his missing father, whom he eventually discovers as having taken over Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s criminal empire and turned it into a force for good. Bruce asks BJ to assume control of the organization so that he can become Batman once again. A story in &quot;Generations II&quot; has Bruce&#x27;s dying wife imply that BJ isn&#x27;t his biological son, but this is not explored until &quot;Generations III&quot;, where BJ uses a Lazarus Pit and becomes Robin once more, ultimately learning that he truly is Bruce&#x27;s son and everything was a plan by his mother to make up for never allowing father and son to work together as heroes. In &quot;Generations III&quot;, BJ&#x27;s life is greatly extended by the use of the Lazarus Pit so he can help the human resistance battle the forces of Darkseid, but when he is mortally wounded he decides to pass on, feeling that he&#x27;s kept Kara waiting far too long; the sight of their spirits departing together is enough to make even Bruce Senior shed a tear.

For more information on a similar concept, see Damian Wayne, Bruce Wayne&#x27;s son by Talia al Ghul. In the wake of his father&#x27;s apparent death, his father&#x27;s first Robin, Dick Grayson, took over as Batman with Damian serving as the new Robin. The version of Damian depicted in &quot;&quot; has more in common with Bruce Jr. than with his portrayal in comics.

===Deathwing===
Introduced as an alternative Dick Grayson in the pages of &quot;Team Titans&quot; from a timeline when his Titan teammate Donna Troy had a son who was driven mad, took on the mantle of Lord Chaos and conquered his world. This version of Dick stayed in his identity of Nightwing and helped train squadrons of superpowered teenagers that became known as the Teen Titans. He was involved with the much younger Titan Mirage during this time. This alternative-future Nightwing came back in time and briefly joins the Team Titans when their mission takes them to their past, our present. This version of Nightwing, attacked and corrupted by a dark version of Raven shortly after his arrival, changes his name to &quot;Deathwing&quot;, and serves as her assistant. He becomes so twistedly evil that he at one point tracks down his one-time lover, Mirage, and rapes her. She becomes pregnant and has a child named Julienne.

During the Zero Hour event that retroactively erased this timeline, Mirage, Terra and Deathwing survive. It is later established that they are from the current timeline, and were shunted through time and given false memories by the Time Trapper, who wished to use them as sleeper agents against the time travel villain Extant.

It wasn&#x27;t revealed until one of the later runs of the Teen Titans that this was not Dick Grayson, in fact his true identity was never uncovered. After this storyline, this version of Nightwing has not been seen since.

===Red Robin===

In &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; (a post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; Earth-22), a middle-aged Dick Grayson reclaims the Robin mantle and becomes Red Robin, not at the side of his former mentor Batman, but rather with Superman&#x27;s League. His uniform is closer to Batman&#x27;s in design, rather than any previous Robin uniform. Age has not slowed him down, as he possesses all of his stealth and fighting skills. In this story he has a daughter with Starfire; Mar&#x27;i Grayson (Nightstar). Starfire has apparently died by the time of the story, according to the Elliot S. Maggin novelization, and Nightstar calls Bruce Wayne &quot;Grandpa&quot;, despite no blood relation. At the end of the comic and the novel, Bruce and Dick reconcile.

Red Robin reappeared in promotional material for the DC &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot; event. Eventually, it was revealed that this Red Robin was not Dick Grayson, but rather Jason Todd who appeared under the cape and cowl. The Red Robin costume was stated to be more symbolism, than an actual costume choice, as Jason has been both the &quot;Red&quot; Hood and &quot;Robin&quot;, being shown as &quot;Red Robin&quot;.

However, in &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot; #17, Jason dons a Red Robin suit from a display case in the &quot;Bat Bunker&quot; (Earth-51&#x27;s equivalent to the Bat Cave) as he and Earth-51 Batman join the fight raging on the Earth above the bunker. Jason keeps his new suit and identity for the rest of his tenure as a &quot;Challenger of the Unknown&quot;, only to discard it on his return to New Earth and revert to his &quot;Red Hood&quot; street clothing.

During the &quot;Scattered Pieces&quot; tie-in to &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot;, a new &quot;Red Robin&quot; makes his appearance, at first only as a glimmering image following Robin (Tim Drake) and suspected to have stolen a briefcase of money from the Penguin. Tim initially suspects Jason Todd of reprising his Red Robin persona. Jason claims innocence, supposing that someone may have stolen his suit when he discarded it earlier. The new Red Robin breaks up a scuffle between Tim and Jason, and later is revealed to be Ulysses Armstrong. Armstrong later changes costumes when he reveals himself to be the new Anarky, and after being severely burned in an explosion, an embattled Tim Drake dons the less-revealing Red Robin costume to hide his wounds. He later returns to his standard uniform.

In 2009, a new on-going series was introduced titled &quot;Red Robin&quot;. The new Red Robin was revealed to be Tim Drake.

In 2014-5&#x27;s &quot;Multiversity&quot; series, a Red Robin also appears as part of Superman&#x27;s darker incarnation of the Justice League on Earth-22, still based on the alternate future continuity of &quot;Kingdom Come.&quot;

===Earth-6: Stan Lee&#x27;s Robin===
A version of Robin exists for Stan Lee&#x27;s &quot;Just Imagine...&quot; line of comics, in which DC Comics characters were re-imagined by Marvel Comics luminary Stan Lee. Robin is an orphan who has been forced by Reverend Darkk, the series&#x27; main villain, into becoming a thief and a murderer. He meets Batman when Darkk assigns Robin to kill him. Batman survives the attack and in return shows Robin what kind of a man Darkk really is. Robin joins the good side for a time, but in the crisis issue it is revealed that Robin has in fact been working with Darkk the whole time; in the end he is transformed into a &quot;Hawk Man&quot;, before being reborn through Yggdrasil as the &quot;Atom&quot;. In the current New 52 DC Multiverse, these events took place on Earth-6.

===DC One Million===
In DC One Million setting, the Batman of the 853rd Century is aided by the robot called Robin the &quot;Toy&quot; Wonder. This Batman&#x27;s parents were guards on the prison planet of Pluto and died in a prison riot that turned into a mass slaughter of the guards. Robin is programmed with the personality of this Batman as a boy and acts as a foil/source of perspective so that he will not become consumed by darkness in his quest for justice. This Robin believes this was the same reason Bruce Wayne brought Dick Grayson into his life.

===Earth-31: Robin Redblade===
On this alternate Earth, accelerated climate change has resulted in rapid sea level rise, transforming Earth-31 into a devastated waterworld. On the craft Flying Fox, Robin Redblade is one of the crew, and the vessel is piloted by Captain Leatherwing (Batman of Earth-31). Earth-31 also seems to have its own Teen Titans, and Robin Redblade is a member.

===Dick Grayson (Earth-43)===
In this universe, the setting of &quot;Batman &amp; Dracula: Red Rain&quot; and its sequels, the Flying Graysons are killed by the vampire Batman, as shown in &quot;DC Infinite Halloween Special&quot;. Dick grows up to become an obsessive vampire hunter, but is turned by Batman in &quot;The Search for Ray Palmer: Red Rain&quot;, and becomes his partner. Robin has remained a vampire and is now a member of the &quot;Blood League&quot;, a vampire Justice League, alongside Earth-43&#x27;s Vampire Batman.

===Dick Grayson (Earth-50)===
In the &quot;Wildstorm&quot; universe, Dick Grayson is a Planetary agent in Gotham City, partnered with a man named Jasper who resembles the Joker. He appears in &quot;Planetary/Batman: Night on Earth&quot;, prior to the Planetary team&#x27;s shift into universes with a Batman. However, given the events of Flashpoint, this alternate Earth was merged with Earth-0 and Earth-13 and therefore this character no longer exists in main DC continuity.

===The Dark Knight Universe Robins===
These stories are set in Frank Miller&#x27;s Dark Knight Universe, which is not considered in continuity with the monthly titles. Miller has stated that the Dark Knight Universe consists of &quot;&quot;, &quot;All Star Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, the Spawn/Batman crossover, &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight Strikes Again&quot; and the cancelled &quot;Holy Terror, Batman!&quot; In this version, Batman looks upon his sidekicks as employees rather than proteges (although he refers to Robin as a protégé in &quot;All Star Batman and Robin&quot; #9), whom he threatens to &quot;fire&quot; from their &quot;jobs&quot;, which he even does to Dick Grayson.

====Dick Grayson====
In Frank Miller&#x27;s Dark Knight Universe, Grayson&#x27;s origin differs in various ways to the official DC Comics Universe. As seen in the &quot;All Star Batman and Robin&quot; title, he is a twelve-year-old boy who performs in the circus with his two parents, as the Flying Graysons. Bruce Wayne had come to the show many times to watch him perform his stunts. One night, while Wayne watches the show with reporter Vicki Vale, the Graysons perform an amazing feat. The audience begin to cheer and clap when suddenly a man arrives and shoots Grayson&#x27;s parents in the head.

Batman takes out the gunman while some corrupt Gotham City Police officers take Dick Grayson into custody. They take him instead to a place outside Gotham City, into a deserted stretch of forest where they torture or execute people, but Batman comes to the rescue. Batman takes Dick into the Batmobile and asks him to join him in his crusade against crime in Gotham City. Dick agrees to join the crusade. Upon arrival in the Batcave, Batman intends for Dick to survive in the cave without any help. However Alfred Pennyworth takes pity on Dick and gives him a meal and a decent place to sleep. Batman is displeased, as he wants Dick to go through the same things he did, whether Dick likes it or not.

Later, Batman brings in the killer of Dick&#x27;s parents, a man called Jocko-boy Vanzetti. Batman tells him that even though Vanzetti killed his parents, someone else hired him to do so. Batman gives Grayson, who at the time had an axe, the choice of whether to kill Jocko-boy or not. Grayson cuts the tape over Vanzetti&#x27;s mouth and asks him who hired him to kill his parents. The answer, much to Batman&#x27;s disgust, is the Joker. Batman orders Grayson to make himself a costume. He does so using Robin Hood as an inspiration. He becomes an archer and wears a cape with a hood thus calling himself &quot;Hood&quot;. Batman, upon seeing this, pulls his hood down, telling him that anyone could do simply that. Batman tells him to lose the hood and calls him Robin. With his new alter-ego confirmed, he accompanies Batman to confront Green Lantern, as Batman and Green Lantern talk in one of Batman&#x27;s safe houses which Robin had painted yellow in order to keep Hal Jordan from using his power ring. After a lengthy discussion in which Jordan loses his composure and strikes Batman, Jordan accuses Batman of kidnapping Grayson and dressing him up as his sidekick. Batman tells Jordan that Robin is not Grayson, but in fact a boy he met six years ago on a trip to Istanbul. He eventually retracts the lie and merely assures Jordan that Grayson is not Robin. Robin then reveals he took Jordan&#x27;s power ring and after a short fight, Robin accidentally hits Jordan in the throat, cutting his air supply. Batman then hits Grayson to make him &#x27;stay down&#x27;, unmasks and performs a tracheotomy to save Jordan&#x27;s life. After this, Batman reflects on the event, saying that he did not do a very good job of teaching Robin and then takes Robin to his parents&#x27; grave to grieve, claiming that is where it started. Dick cries and punches the headstone, after which Batman consoles his grieving and mournful young ward.

Sometime later, Batman fires Grayson for proving unsatisfactory, which strengthens the rift between the two, and they eventually part ways. In &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, Grayson is absent but mentioned several times. First, Commissioner Gordon asks Bruce if he has spoken with him recently, and Bruce coldly says he has not. Later, when Batman&#x27;s new Robin, Carrie Kelley, rescues Batman and asks about his tank-like vehicle, Batman responds that &quot;Dick called it the Batmobile&quot;, and later when Batman suffers a diabetic stroke, he desperately calls out Grayson&#x27;s name. He is also shown talking to Grayson in his mind, such as when he calls the Mutant leader a &quot;brand of evil we had never dreamed of.&quot; This seems to imply a sense of fatherly love otherwise not shown, or that Batman simply missed Grayson&#x27;s company.

In &quot;The Dark Knight Strikes Again&quot;, Grayson re-appears as a genetically altered supervillain. Sometime after his dismissal, he apparently joined forces with senior villains such as Luthor, and underwent extensive gene manipulation to gain a healing factor and shapeshifting powers, but at the cost of his sanity. At the behest of the government, Grayson begins a maniacal crusade to hunt down and kill as many superheroes as possible, but in order to conceal his identity and partly due to a twisted revenge scheme on Batman, Grayson takes on the appearance of the Joker, who killed himself in &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;.

After maiming and killing a number of heroes, such as Guardian, the Creeper and the Martian Manhunter, he seeks out Carrie Kelley, Batman&#x27;s new partner, a.k.a. Catgirl, intending to kill her in order to exact his final revenge on Batman. Grayson confronts Carrie and Green Arrow in the sewers and engages them in battle. Carrie strikes him with thermite, acid and all sorts of chemicals that cause Grayson to explode, apparently killing him, but Saturn Girl later has a vision of a second encounter between Carrie and Grayson and reveals to Carrie that Grayson (though his identity is not yet revealed at this point) is still alive. Grayson eventually ambushes Carrie in the Batcave and proceeds to beat her brutally, lacerating her lips and breaking her bones one by one. Batman arrives and recognises Grayson when he activates the Batcave&#x27;s self-destruct and Grayson attempts to shut it down with his old abort code, prompting him to revert to his original form and costume. As Elongated Man takes Carrie to safety, Batman and Grayson contemptuously go over their bleak history together, with Grayson even admitting that despite his harsh treatment, he loved Batman like a father. The two eventually fight, but Grayson remains unharmed by everything Batman throws at him: when Batman beheads him with a Thanagarian axe, Grayson effortlessly catches his head and places it back on his neck. Eventually, Batman hurls himself and Grayson into a pit of lava beneath the Batcave; Grayson falls into the lava and is totally disintegrated, thereby leaving nothing left of Grayson for him to grow back, while Batman is rescued by Superman. As Grayson&#x27;s remains disappear, Batman acknowledges his ward&#x27;s demise with a sad &quot;So long, Boy Wonder&quot;.

====Jason Todd====
In &quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns,&quot; Jason Todd is referred to have died in the line of duty, although the exact details are not given. It is revealed in the prestige format one-shot &quot;Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade,&quot; co-written by Miller and Brian Azzarello, release on June 15, 2016. It is revealed that after Jason defeats and captures the Joker; the villain becomes fixated on him. After the Joker escaped, Jason tracks his whereabouts on his own, and is brutally beaten to death by the Joker&#x27;s men.

====Carrie Kelley====
===Trinity===
In the &quot;Trinity&quot; series, reality is altered, removing Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman from the timeline. In this alternative world, &quot;Richie&quot; Grayson is a member of the Zucco mob.

===Elseworlds===

Alfred is a familiar character in the Batman books as Bruce Wayne&#x27;s elderly butler. However, in &quot;Batman: Dark Allegiances&quot;, set in the World War II era, Batman, Catwoman, and Alfred were recruited to fight behind enemy lines in Nazi Germany in the winter of 1940. Alfred is given the codename Robin.

In &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&quot;, Dick Grayson is Robin until he goes to college. The role is then taken up by Batman&#x27;s son, Bruce Wayne Junior, against his mother&#x27;s wishes. However, he gives up the role when Dick is murdered, in order to become Batman. Several years later, Clark Wayne, the biological son of Joel Kent and adopted son of Bruce Wayne Jr., takes on the role of Robin, before becoming Knightwing.

Set in the 1960s, &quot;&quot; was written and drawn by Howard Chaykin and Dan Brereton and published in 1997–98. It has Bruce Wayne as a detective in the Gotham Police after his family was ruined by the Great Depression. Wayne Manor has been taken over by the rebellious and somewhat unhinged Barbara Gordon, daughter of police Commissioner James Gordon. Her live-in boyfriend is Richart Graustark, who goes under the name of &quot;Dick Grayson&quot;, presumably to cover his German origins (World War II being still fresh in people&#x27;s minds at the time). Barbara and Graustark fight crime as Batgirl and Robin, though, in true 1960s anti-establishment style, their main targets are corrupt cops, in particular those led by the Two-Face-like Detective Duell and the Joker-like but very feminine Bianca Steeplechase. In this version, Grayson&#x27;s family are still circus acrobats, but their deaths are caused as a result of his activities as Robin rather than the traditional other way round. He is overcome by grief and rage over their murder and his subsequent recklessness leads to his own death. He is replaced as Barbara&#x27;s partner by Wayne, who takes the identity of Batman, but the memory of him drives Barbara, wracked with guilt over an affair with Wayne and her failure to prevent Grayson&#x27;s death, to the point of insanity. Becoming increasingly more violent and unstable, she adopts the Robin persona as part of seeking revenge against Steeplechase, who she later drowns. Within the New 52 DC Multiverse, Earth-37&#x27;s 1960s seem comparable to those of &quot;Thrillkiller&quot;, although while it has a Batgirl, Robin and female Joker, it now seems to lack a Batman.

The main character in &quot;JLA: The Riddle of the Beast&quot;, young Robin Drake brings together all the heroes of The World to battle the Beast (Etrigan).

In the French Revolution set &quot;Batman: Reign of Terror&quot;, Bruce Wayne&#x27;s sister learns his secret identity, and designs a Robin outfit to aid him.

&quot;&quot; features three generations of Waynes, past, present and future. In the future section, Brenna Wayne is aided by an ape with augmented intelligence in a Robin costume, who goes by the name &#x27;Rodney&#x27;.

In the American Civil War set &quot;The Blue, The Gray and the Bat&quot;, Captain Bruce Wayne is aided by a Native American named Redbird. Redbird&#x27;s family were killed by white men, and, until he got his revenge, he wore war paint in a design similar to a domino mask.

In the futuristic &quot;Robin 3000&quot;, Earth is controlled by despotic aliens. Batman (Bruce Wayne XX) is killed trying to stop them, but his mission is continued by his nephew, Tom (Thomas) Wayne. This was created by P. Craig Russell in 1986 as &quot;Tom Swift 3000&quot;, but later rewritten in 1992 as a Robin story when the original plans fell through.

In the &quot;Robin&quot; 1996 Elseworlds annual, an unnamed young warrior in 16th century Japan is raised by the Bat-Samurai, and nicknamed Tengu, after the bird-spirits, by a female Cat-Ninja. Tengu loses his mentor in battle. Tengu was later revealed to be the rightful heir to the imperial throne, and the usurper (believing he knew this and plotted against him) attempted to kill him. He killed the usurper in self-defense but, since he had already sworn loyalty, was constrained to suicide as a result of this dishonor.

In the &quot;Detective Comics&quot; 1996 Elseworlds annual (&quot;&quot;), an orphan on the streets of 17th century Kingston who became cabin boy to Leatherwing the pirate.

In the &quot;Robin&quot; 1998 Legends of The Dead Earth annual, humanity is trying to reach other worlds in generation ships. On one of these, a group called the Proctors have seized control and everyone else are slaves who are executed on their 30th birthdays to conserve the ship&#x27;s resources. Tris Plover, a 29-year-old slave, rebels against the Proctors. She meets another rebel, called the Batman, who gives her the Robin identity. At the cost of their lives, they succeed in defeating the Proctors and Robin sets the ship on a course for the planet New Gotham. &quot;Bird Dark&quot; is the name of Batman&#x27;s partner in the somewhat garbled fables told on another colony world, as featured in the &quot;Legends of the Dead Earth&quot; &quot;Batman&quot; Annual #20. (1996) While the name is based on Nightwing, the costume is in Robin&#x27;s colors.

In &quot;,&quot; Dick (as Robin), along with Barbara (as Batgirl) is tortured then murdered by The Joker with his Kryptonian gauntlets during a raid on Arkham Asylum, driving Batman temporarily insane after he witnesses their ordeals and death. The grief-stricken hero then kills Joker for revenge. Later, in the sequel &quot;,&quot; Dick returns as a spirit after the Joker returns from Hell. He helps Batman defeats the Clown Prince of Crime once and for all, and gives Batman the strength to move on.

===Tiny Titans===
Tiny Titans is a kiddie-based series follows the exploits of the Teen Titans (and other DCU character), as grade school kids attending school for Super-hero sidekicks. Dick Grayson&#x27;s Robin is a primary character in the series, and often tries to act like the leader, although the rest of the Tiny Titans rarely listen to him. He temporarily began wearing a kiddie version of his first Nightwing costume, but later went back to being Robin. Later issues eventually introduced Jason Todd and Tim Drake into the series as toddlers who Barbara Gordon babysits. Both Jason and Dick wear the original Robin costumes, while Tim wears the 2006 &quot;One Year Later&quot; Robin costume. Talon also appears as a frequent enemy of Robin, but in the conclusion of issue 46 he gets his hair cut like Robin by Batman&#x27;s butler.

===Batman: Year 100===
An alternative version of Robin appears in Paul Pope&#x27;s &quot;&quot; limited series. This Robin is a dark-skinned teenager who acts as Batman&#x27;s partner as well as the mechanic for &quot;the Batmobile&quot;, a high-tech motorcycle. Little is revealed about this Robin&#x27;s backstory other than that he was apparently adopted by Batman at a young age, and that Robin is his real name rather than an alias. Unlike other iterations of the character, the Robin in &quot;Year 100&quot; does not wear a costume.

===Pre-Crisis Hypertime===
Hypertime is a fictional concept presented in the 1999 DC comic book series &quot;The Kingdom&quot;, to explain any continuity discrepancies in DC Universe stories and a variations of the Multiverse that existed before Crisis on Infinite Earths. During the &quot;Hypertension&quot; story arc, Superboy Kon-El travels through multiple realities battling Black Zero an evil alternate version of himself that&#x27;s been abducting other clone Superboys. One of the alternate Superboys has become Batman&#x27;s latest Robin.

===Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew===
The 1980s series &quot;Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew&quot; presented the parallel Earth of &quot;Earth-C-Minus,&quot; a world populated by talking animal superheroes that paralleled the mainstream DC Universe. Earth-C-Minus was the home of Boyd, the Robin Wonder, a robin sidekick to the Batmouse, and presumably an analog of the mainstream DC Universe&#x27;s Dick Grayson (including wearing a variant of Dick Grayson&#x27;s Robin costume).

===Injustice series===
====Injustice: Gods Among Us====
In the prequel comic of the video game &quot;&quot;, Damian remains under the guise of Robin until Year Five where he becomes Nightwing. Although he will still become one of Superman&#x27;s allies in his Regime. It is revealed in Year One that Dick Grayson&#x27;s death at the hands of Damian Wayne was a mere accident because Damian was frustrated at Dick&#x27;s lecturing him during a prison riot. In Year Two, Damian makes two minor appearances: once to alert Superman to Sinestro&#x27;s arrival at the Justice League Watchtower, and again while Despero, having been assaulted by the Sinestro Corps, is crashing toward Earth. In Year Three, Damian attempts to defeat some villains and nearly gets killed but Dick Grayson, (now the new Deadman), saves him and gives him his old Nightwing costume as a birthday present, unaware to Damian or any other Regime members. Despite having severed ties with his father, Damian still greatly regards Alfred. Unknown to Damian, Superman, thinking Damian&#x27;s &quot;Nightwing&quot; birthday gift is a set up by Batman, secretly sends Zsasz to kill Alfred before Damian arrives back at the Batcave. With Alfred gone, Damian now joins Superman&#x27;s Regime. Batman, becoming aware of Superman&#x27;s plan afterward, is too late to convince his son of the truth behind Alfred&#x27;s death.

====Injustice 2====
In the prequel comic of the video game sequel &quot;Injustice 2&quot;, Damian is first seen in a prison cell as an imprisoned and powerless Superman and Batman talk about what happened, with Batman, tiring of Superman&#x27;s insistence that it was somehow Bruce&#x27;s fault for not being there when Clark needed him most, he turns to walk away. As he does so, Superman throws up the past deceased Robins, Dick Grayson and Jason Todd as well as Tim Drake who unbeknownst to Batman is imprisoned in the Phantom Zone along with the surviving Titans. Then, suddenly, there is an attack on the prison by the Suicide Squad and an imposter Batman, all under the leadership of Damian&#x27;s mother, Talia and the League of Assassins, to free Damian for his grandfather Ra&#x27;s Al Ghul&#x27;s current plans. Damian becomes very angry at his mother and Athanasia Al Ghul for having killed the powerless prison authorities like Turpin, instead of disarming them and not releasing Superman and Cyborg. At Ra&#x27;s&#x27; secret lair, Damian is introduced to his sister, Athanasia Al Ghul. Later, in Ra&#x27;s&#x27; Lair, He meets several other of Ra&#x27;s&#x27; recruits, including, Vixen, Poison Ivy, Cheetah and the impostor Batman&#x27;s remaining Suicide Squad members. During this meeting, Ra&#x27;s Al Ghul talks about the 5 years since Joker&#x27;s corruption of Superman and the state of the world. Damian is later tasked along with Deadshot and Katana to capture the original Blue Beetle, Ted Kord. On the next day, Damian brings Alfred&#x27;s corpse from Wayne Manor while having Black Lightning&#x27;s daughters, and the son of Green Arrow and Black Canary be kidnapped, and later to nurse his butler after resurrecting him in the Lazarus Pit. Later during the Insurgency&#x27;s raid on Ra&#x27;s hideout in South America, Damian predicts that the Insurgency will come with no surrender thanks to Batman. Damian fought his father temporarily until a fully recovered Alfred stops them from killing each other. As Blue Beetle destroys Ra&#x27;s hideout, which indirectly kills most of the extinct animals and accidentally kills Diablo, Damian is separated from Alfred. Despite Alfred currently being under the Insurgency&#x27;s care, Damian is still glad he is safe.

Few days later, Damian was sent to recruit Black Adam. However, the ruler of Kahndaq refuses to cooperate with Ra&#x27;s. At the same time Damian met Kara Zor-El/Supergirl, who is later revealed to be a Kryptonian like Superman. He and Kara are later fighting terrorists while passing by flying together. As Damian is about kill a terrorist, Kara told him to stop from making a mistake on behalf of her feelings to protect the innocence without killing everyone. On the next day, Adam recommended Damian to stay with him and Kara, while needing his help for their rescue mission on freeing their ally, Diana. As Kara is sent to infiltrate Amazon, the nations&#x27; security is very tight, Damian is worried if the Amazons spill the truth about what the Regimes had done 5 years, the Regime will lose Kara, but Adam tells Damian to be patient, and is soon glad to find out that most of the Amazonian are still loyal to Diana, quickly succeeding the rescue without being captured. Upon hearing news about the massacre in the small town at Williams, Arizona caused by his grandfather and Solovar sending Amazo killing every human around including women and children, Damian departs to Gorilla City where the League of Assassins and their Suicide Squad are hiding to inform his closest allies (Vixen and Animal Man) about what the Gorillas and League of Assassins had done to the peaceful people of the said town, then spills the truth to entire two villainous groups to prevent Kahndaq sharing a similar fate, resulting in Gorilla Grodd&#x27;s failed uprising attempt from taking over Gorilla City, leading him and his followers to be exiled from their home city. He, Animal Man and Vixen soon warn their Regime allies about Ra&#x27;s and Solovar&#x27;s plan to bring destructions on innocent humans, while Kara herself is not yet prepared to fight against Amazo and must stay in Kahndaq.

The third Robin, Tim Drake/Red Robin, one of the Titans who first rebelled Superman&#x27;s regime is being released from the Phantom Zone&#x27;s imprisonment along with Wonder Girl and Starfire, with the exception of Superboy who preferred to stay in the said dimension after Superman broke his heart back in the first game&#x27;s previous comic issue. Unfortunately, Tim&#x27;s reunion does not last long, with Zod trailing the Titans to be able to escape and shooting Tim&#x27;s heart with his Heat Vision from behind, killing the Boy Wonder. Before Batman plans to avenge Tim&#x27;s death, Ra&#x27;s sends Amazo to kill Zod for good, and Harley sadly expresses about how Tim had been a better Robin as Dick used to be if they were alive. After fully he recovered from his heart surgery during Amazo&#x27;s attack, Superboy, now the Insurgency&#x27;s new Superman learned that he is now implanted with Zod&#x27;s heart, the same villainous Kryptonian general who murdered Tim.

At some point after Damian was forced to return to League of Assassins by his mother and younger sister, Damian figured out that the impostor Batman is none other than the revived former second Robin, Jason Todd, now working for Ra&#x27;s. During the Insurgency&#x27;s raid on the Assassins&#x27; hideout in South America to save one of their kidnapped children and Harley, Jason fought Wildcat and almost killed him, until Green Arrow and Black Canary&#x27;s son Conner knocks Jason back with a sonic scream inherited from his mother Canary. As the League of Assassins and their Suicide Squads relocated in Gorilla City to allied themselves with King Solovar, then recently kill the peaceful human civilians in Arizona by dispatching Amazo, Jason starting to doubt about Ra&#x27;s ideal.

By time Ra&#x27;s and Solovar begin their plans to wipe out every humans on Earth after Grodd and his followers had been exiled, Damian, Vixen, and Animal Man plan a second rebellion against Ra&#x27;s for his madness. Jason soon figures out the three heroes&#x27; plan to betray Ra&#x27;s. However, Damian tries to convince Jason of what they are doing for Ra&#x27;s is actually wrong, and believes in him that killing innocent human civilians is not what he desired.

====Injustice vs. The Masters of the Universe====
As this series continues alternatively from the second game&#x27;s bad ending, it revealed that Damian (now as a new Batman) and his fellow ex-Regime and Titans member Cyborg finally realize what they have been fighting for, just like how The Flash, Hal Jordan and the late-Shazam felt before them, and began to defect to and lead the Insurgency, while also being joined by the former Batman imposter Jason/Red Hood. Damian admit on never forget his accidental sin he committed on his late-Nightwing predecessor Dick.

When Skeletor&#x27;s Army arrived in their universe&#x27;s Earth, at the same time Darkseid&#x27;s Apokalips Army arrived there as well, Damian summoned He-Man/Prince Adam and his allies for a same purposes. After manage to find and freed his both father and predecessor from Superman&#x27;s Brainiac Tech brainwashing, Damian told him about Supergirl&#x27;s location and compare Superman to be just like Zod and Ra&#x27;s was. Unfortunately, Damian is snapped by Wonder Woman&#x27;s lasso on his neck from behind in cold blood, but his death eventually gives original Batman a stronger will to break free from Superman&#x27;s control. When Skeletor revealed his true color on playing both Darkseid and Superman&#x27;s side for his scheme, Superman stand down and recently mourn Damian&#x27;s death, leading him once again made a temporary truce to settle with Darkseid and Skeletor.

===&quot;52&quot; Multiverse===
In the final issue of &quot;52&quot;, a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated &quot;Earth-2&quot;. As a result of Mister Mind &quot;eating&quot; aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Earth-2, including Robin, among other Justice Society of America characters. Based on comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-2. However, in &quot;Justice Society of America Annual&quot; #1, published in 2008, the Silver Scarab explains that the events of the Crisis are remembered by the people of this Earth-2, and from &quot;their&quot; perspective, Earth-2 seemed to be the only Earth to have survived the Crisis, raising theories as to whether or not Earth-2 was really destroyed, or was perhaps replaced by a new Earth-2. Indeed, in &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; #20, published in December 2008, Starman explains that during the re-expansion of the DC Multiverse, Earth-2 was reborn &quot;along with everyone on it&quot;, including Robin.

Following &quot;Flashpoint&quot; (2011) and &quot;The New 52&quot; reboot, this Earth is replaced by another reimagining of Earth 2, one where Batman&#x27;s daughter Helena Wayne served as Robin until an incident five years prior to the relaunch sent her to DC&#x27;s primary continuity, Earth-0, where she works as the Huntress. The 2014 series &quot;Earth 2: World&#x27;s End&quot; establishes that Dick Grayson never served as Robin on this Earth, and was instead a reporter who married Barbara Gordon and had a son. During Darkseid&#x27;s invasion of Earth 2, Barbara is killed, and Dick is trained in how to fight by Ted Grant and goes on a mission to find his missing son.
==&quot;Robin&quot; monthlies==
The first &quot;Robin&quot; miniseries was printed in 1992 following Tim Drake&#x27;s debut as Robin. The series centered around Tim&#x27;s continued training and set up villains linked to the character. It was followed up by another series &quot;Robin II: The Joker&#x27;s Wild!&quot;, which pitted Tim against his predecessor&#x27;s murderer the Joker. With Batman out of town, it was up to Tim and Alfred to end the Joker&#x27;s latest crime spree. A final miniseries, &quot;Robin III: Cry of the Huntress&quot; wrapped up the trilogy, teaming Tim with the Huntress. In 1993, the success of the three miniseries led to the ongoing &quot;Robin&quot; series, which ran 183 issues until 2009. The title was replaced by a &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; series following the &quot;Battle for the Cowl&quot; miniseries, as well as an ongoing &quot;Red Robin&quot; monthly which continues the story of Tim Drake.

==Reception==
According to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2008, Robin is one of the &quot;greatest sidekicks&quot;.

==In other media==

Robin (Dick Grayson) was portrayed by Douglas Croft and Johnny Duncan, respectively, in the 1943 and 1949 fifteen chapter &quot;Batman&quot; serials. Burt Ward played him in the 1966–1968 &quot;Batman&quot; television series and the related 1966 film. In the live-action movies &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, he was played by Chris O&#x27;Donnell. Michael Cera voiced the character in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;.

In &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, as part of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; trilogy, Detective John Blake was played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, though as a homage to the character, where his full legal name is revealed in the ending to be Robin John Blake.

The Dick Grayson version of Robin also appears in &quot;&quot;, voiced by Loren Lester. Grayson is replaced by Tim Drake, played by Mathew Valencia, in the subsequent series &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;.

An older version of Robin / Dick Grayson is portrayed by Brenton Thwaites in the live action series &quot;Titans.&quot;

The animated series &quot;Teen Titans&quot; features Robin (voiced by Scott Menville) as the leader of a team of young heroes; it is hinted in several episodes that this Robin is Dick Grayson. Menville reprises his role as Robin in &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;. The second-season episode &quot;The Best Robin&quot; introduces Carrie Kelley and Tim Drake as their Robins. They are also voiced by Menville.

Robin is also seen in the 1987 Zeller&#x27;s commercial, which features the infamous catchphrase, &quot;Well said, Robin!&quot;.

Dick Grayson is Robin in &quot;Young Justice&quot;, voiced by Jesse McCartney. In the second season, Grayson has become Nightwing, while Tim Drake, voiced by Cameron Bowen, is the new Robin, succeeding Jason Todd, who is already dead by the start of the season.

Robin is portrayed by Nick Lang in &quot;Holy Musical B@man!&quot;. His portrayal is based mainly on Burt Ward&#x27;s Dick Grayson.

The Damian Wayne version of Robin will appear in the live action film &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;, set in the DC Universe (DCU) media franchise.

The Dick Grayson and Jason Todd incarnations of Robin will be featured in the animated film &quot;Dynamic Duo&quot;, focused on their origin story as the &quot;Dynamic Duo&quot;. The film is being produced by DC Studios, Warner Bros. Pictures Animation, and 6th &amp; Idaho for a theatrical release.

<text>Horning is an ancient village and parish in the English county of Norfolk.
It covers an area of 11 km2 and had a population of approximately 1,100 in the 2021 census. Horning parish lies on the northern bank of the River Bure south of the River Thurne and is located in The Broads National Park. For the purposes of local government, it falls within the district of North Norfolk, although areas alongside the rivers and broads fall into the executive area of the Broads Authority.

==History==
The name Horning means the &quot;folk who live on the high ground between the rivers&quot;. Its history dates back to 1020, when the manor was given by King Canute to the newly founded Abbey of St. Benet at Hulme. The Bishop of Norwich, as Abbot of St. Benets, is still Lord of the Manor.

Horning Parish extends along the south bank of the River Bure to Thurne Mouth, and includes the ruins of St Benet&#x27;s Abbey &amp; St. James Hospital. St. Benet&#x27;s Abbey is a Grade I listed building, and dates back to the 9th century. The importance of the Abbey as a medieval place of pilgrimage is reflected in the medieval finds of two papal seals, that would have secured documents from the Pope. It was also the site of the composition of the Chronicle of John of Oxnead.

The Church of St. Benedict lies half a mile east of the village, and dates back to the 13th century.

Horning is situated on the River Bure (pronounced locally &quot;Burr&quot;) between Wroxham and Ludham. A ferry plied across the river for more than 1,000 years.

Horning has an entry in the Domesday Book of 1086, noted under the name &#x27;Horningam&#x27;. In 1086, Horning had 18 villagers, 11 &#x27;smallholders&#x27;, 4 cattle, 10 pigs, 360 sheep and the taxable value was £4.

Archaeologists have found ancient earthworks in Horning, which run alongside the River Bure, possibly dating to the early Saxon period. The earliest ancient monument is a Bronze Age ring ditch and possible burial pit. Neolithic and Bronze Age artefacts have also been found.

==Leisure and attractions==

The village of Horning is a very popular tourist destination within the Norfolk Broads, having attractions both around the village and surrounding areas. The village lies on the north bank of the River Bure, and has many waterside properties, pubs, shops, restaurants, tea-rooms, boat-trips as well as other features to enjoy.

Horning is picturesque, and described as the prettiest village on the broads. The sights to see are: the River Bure from the landing stages, Lower Street, St. Benedict&#x27;s Church, and many properties with thatched roofs.

Following Lower Street to the east, leads to the school, marina, leisure centre, church and the old riverbank. North of Horning are the broads of Barton, Alderfen and Burntfen, and village of Neatishead; to the west is the popular area of Hoveton &amp; Wroxham; to the east lies the quaint village of Ludham. To the south, across the river via the ferry, are Bure Marshes and village of Woodbastwick. The Ferry Inn to the east of the village was largely destroyed in a Second World War bombing raid by the German Luftwaffe on 26 April 1941, during which 15 bombs are believed to have been dropped on Horning and the surrounding area by a single aircraft. Most landed in the local marshes, but one hit the ferry and one hit the Inn, where 21 of the 24 people in the pub at the time were killed. The Ferry Inn was open for business with a makeshift bar only three weeks later.
Horning is home to Southern Comfort, the Mississippi Cruise boat, which leaves from the staithe adjacent to The Swan Inn.

The village is popular for sail and motor boating, with Horning Sailing Club hosting regular annual events. Several boatyards specialise in boat sales, boat hire, boat building and repairs. There are two marinas which offer private mooring facilities. The River Bure is navigable from the North Sea at Great Yarmouth all the way to Horning.

The village centre is quite small, consisting of just a single street, a village green, The Swan Inn pub (built early 19th century but dating back to 1696), a few shops and restaurants, and a riverbank adjacent to the River Bure. The main village hall, playing fields and children&#x27;s play area, are located behind Lower Street on the upper side of the village.

Outside the village centre is the popular Bewilderwood theme park, which was voted best large attraction in the East of England (2009), as well as having won many other UK and International awards. Broadland Cycle Hire is located within Bewilderwood, from which there are many good cycle routes through rural areas to villages and broads.

Other local attractions nearby include Barton Broad boardwalk, Neatishead village, Ludham village, shopping in Hoveton &amp; Wroxham. A short distance away are many beaches, such as Waxham, Sea Palling and Winterton-on-Sea, as well as the more popular holiday destinations of Great Yarmouth and Cromer. The North Norfolk Coast, which is a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, is approximately an hour away.

<doc id="99381" wikidata="Q334413" url="?curid=99381" title="United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission">
<text>The United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) was created through the adoption of United Nations Security Council resolution 1284 of 17 December 1999 and its mission lasted until June 2007.

UNMOVIC was meant to replace the former United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) to carry on with the mandate to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), and to operate a system of ongoing monitoring and verification to check Iraq&#x27;s compliance with its obligations not to reacquire the same weapons banned by the Security Council.

== Background and UNMOVIC&#x27;s predecessor UNSCOM ==
UNSCOM was created with the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 in April 1991.

Lack of cooperation between UNSCOM and the Iraqi government, plus Saddam Hussein&#x27;s failure to provide unfettered access to UN arms inspectors, led the United States and the United Kingdom to launch air strikes during Operation Desert Fox. Along with founded suspicion of the CIA interference and infiltration in UNSCOM, military intervention in Iraq in 16–18 December 1998 marked the virtual end of UNSCOM&#x27;s legitimacy. Those facts led to its closing down and to, at least, one-year hiatus regarding weapon inspections in Iraq.

== UNMOVIC ==
=== Organisation ===
UNMOVIC was created with the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1284 in December 1999.

In addition to the Office of the Chairman with executive, legal and liaison functions, UNMOVIC comprised four divisions (Planning and Operations, Analysis and Assessment, Information, Technical Support and Training) as well as an administrative service. The Commission maintained its headquarters at the United Nations in New York.

=== Operations ===
In December 1999 UNMOVIC was to take the token and even though Resolution 1284 required its inspection teams allowance to &quot;immediate and unconditional access to any weapons sites and facilities&quot;, Iraq rejected the resolution. UNMOVIC could not send inspections to Iraq well into November 2002 after Resolution 1441 was passed.

In 2000, the Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed Dr. Hans Blix of Sweden to be the Commission&#x27;s Executive Chairman. He served from 1 March 2000 until the end of June 2003, roughly 3 months after Iraq had been invaded.

With no ongoing inspections on the ground in Iraq, political tension escalated in the period 2000-2002 and, in the aftermath of September 11 attacks in 2001 Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime in Iraq became the spotlight of the ongoing War on Terror policies in Washington.

Following the mandate of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441, The president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, was forced to allow UN inspectors back to his country in November 2002.

UN Resolution 1441 was an actual enhancement of previous United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 and provided: &quot;that Iraq shall provide UNMOVIC and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) immediate, unimpeded, unconditional, and unrestricted access to any and all, including underground, areas, facilities, buildings, equipment, records, and means of transport which they wish to inspect, as well as immediate, unimpeded, unrestricted, and private access to all officials and other persons whom UNMOVIC or the IAEA wish to interview in the mode or location of UNMOVIC&#x27;s or the IAEA&#x27;s choice pursuant to any aspect of their mandates&quot;.

Along with IAEA, UNMOVIC led inspections of alleged chemical and biological facilities in Iraq until shortly before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March 2003.

=== Findings and conclusions ===
UNMOVIC never found any operative weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and although its inspectors were withdrawn in March 2003, continued to operate with respect to those parts of its mandate it could implement outside of Iraq and maintained a degree of preparedness to resume work in Iraq. It maintained a roster of more than 300 experts ready to serve and continued to conduct training.

Its Executive Chairman, Hans Blix, commented in March 2004 that 

&quot;in the buildup to the war, Saddam Hussein and the Iraqis were cooperating with UN inspections, and in February 2003 had provided UNMOVIC with the names of hundreds of scientists to interview, individuals Saddam claimed had been involved in the destruction of banned weapons. Had the inspections been allowed to continue, there would likely have been a very different situation in Iraq.&quot;
Blix also said that America&#x27;s pre-emptive, unilateral actions &quot;have bred more terrorism there and elsewhere&quot;. He accused President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of acting not in bad faith, but with a severe lack of critical thinking.

The mandate of UNMOVIC was terminated on 29 June 2007.

<text>Larches are deciduous conifers in the genus Larix, of the family Pinaceae (subfamily Laricoideae). Growing from tall, they are native to the cooler regions of the northern hemisphere, where they are found in lowland forests in the high latitudes, and high in mountains further south. Larches are among the dominant plants in the boreal forests of Siberia and Canada. Although they are conifers, larches are deciduous trees that lose their needles in the autumn.

==Etymology==
The English name larch ultimately derives from the Latin &quot;larigna&quot;, named after the ancient settlement of Larignum. The story of its naming was preserved by Vitruvius:

It is worth while to know how this wood was discovered. The divine Caesar, being with his army in the neighbourhood of the Alps, and having ordered the towns to furnish supplies, the inhabitants of a fortified stronghold there, called Larignum, trusting in the natural strength of their defences, refused to obey his command. So the general ordered his forces to the assault. In front of the gate of this stronghold there was a tower, made of beams of this wood laid in alternating directions at right angles to each other, like a funeral pyre, and built high, so that they could drive off an attacking party by throwing stakes and stones from the top. When it was observed that they had no other missiles than stakes, and that these could not be hurled very far from the wall on account of the weight, orders were given to approach and to throw bundles of brushwood and lighted torches at this outwork. These the soldiers soon got together.

The flames soon kindled the brushwood which lay about that wooden structure and, rising towards heaven, made everybody think that the whole pile had fallen. But when the fire had burned itself out and subsided, and the tower appeared to view entirely uninjured, Caesar in amazement gave orders that they should be surrounded with a palisade, built beyond the range of missiles. So the townspeople were frightened into surrendering, and were then asked where that wood came from which was not harmed by fire. They pointed to trees of the kind under discussion, of which there are very great numbers in that vicinity. And so, as that stronghold was called Larignum, the wood was called larch.

==Description and distribution==
The tallest species, &quot;Larix occidentalis&quot;, can reach . Larch tree crowns are sparse, with the major branches horizontal; the second and third order branchlets are also ± horizontal in some species (e.g. &quot;L. gmelinii&quot;, &quot;L. kaempferi&quot;), or characteristically pendulous in some other species (e.g. &quot;L. decidua&quot;, &quot;L. griffithii&quot;). Larch shoots are dimorphic, with leaves borne singly on long shoots typically long and bearing several buds, and in dense clusters of 20–50 needles on short shoots only long with only a single bud. The leaves (light green) are needle-like, long, slender (under wide). Larches are among the few deciduous conifers, which are usually evergreen. Other deciduous conifers include the golden larch &quot;Pseudolarix amabilis&quot;, the dawn redwood &quot;Metasequoia glyptostroboides&quot;, the Chinese swamp cypress &quot;Glyptostrobus pensilis&quot; and the bald cypresses in the genus &quot;Taxodium&quot;.

The male (pollen) cones are greenish-yellow to orange-yellowish and fall soon after pollination. The female cones) of larches are erect, small, long, green, red, or purple, ripening brown and woody- or leathery-textured 5–8 months after pollination; in about half the species the bract scales are long and visible, and in the others, short and hidden between the seed scales. Those native to northern regions have small cones () with short bracts, with more southerly species tending to have longer cones (), often with exserted bracts, with the longest cones and bracts produced by the southernmost species, in the Himalayas. The seeds are winged. The root system is broad and deep and the bark is finely cracked and wrinkled in irregular plaques. The wood is bicoloured, with salmon-pink heartwood and yellowish-white sapwood.

The chromosome number is 2n = 24, similar to that of most of the other species of the family Pinaceae.

The genus &quot;Larix&quot; is present in all the temperate-cold zones of the northern hemisphere, from North America to northern Siberia passing through Europe, mountainous China and Japan. The larches are important forest trees of Russia, Central Europe, United States and Canada. They require a cool and fairly humid climate and for this reason they are found in the mountains of the temperate zones, while in the northernmost boreal zones they are also found in the plains. Larch trees go further north than all, reaching in North America and Siberia the tundra and polar ice. The larches are pioneer species not very demanding towards the soil and they are very long-lived trees. They live in pure or mixed forests together with other conifers or more rarely with broad-leaved trees.

==Species and taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Larix&quot; belongs to the subfamily Laricoideae, which also includes the Douglas-firs, genus &quot;Pseudotsuga&quot;; the genus &quot;Cathaya&quot; was also included in some older studies, but is now considered closer to &quot;Pinus&quot; and &quot;Picea&quot;. In the past, the cone bract length was often used to divide the larches into two sections (sect. &quot;Larix&quot; with short bracts, and sect. &quot;Multiserialis&quot; with long bracts), but genetic evidence does not support this division, pointing instead to a genetic divide between Old World and New World species, with the cone and bract size being merely adaptations to climatic conditions. More recent genetic studies have proposed three groups within the genus, with a primary division into North American and Eurasian species, and a secondary division of the Eurasian into northern short-bracted species and southern long-bracted species; there is some dispute over the position of &quot;Larix sibirica&quot;, a short-bracted species which is placed in the short-bracted group by some of the studies and the long-bracted group by others. 

Ten species and one natural hybrid of larch are accepted by Plants of the World Online (POWO), following the conservative treatment in Farjon (2010); several others are accepted by other authors, notably Rushforth, and the &quot;Flora of China&quot;. These are subdivided on the basis of the most recent phylogenetic investigations:

=== Eurasian species ===
==== Northern Eurasian species with short bracts ====
* &quot;Larix decidua&quot; (syn. &quot;L. europaea&quot; ) – European larch. Mountains of central Europe.
* &quot;Larix sibirica&quot; – Siberian larch. Plains of western Siberia.
* &quot;Larix × czekanowskii&quot; – an accepted hybrid between &quot;L. gmelinii&quot; and &quot;L. sibirica&quot;.
* &quot;Larix gmelinii&quot; (syn. &quot;L. dahurica&quot; , &quot;L. cajanderi&quot; ) – Dahurian larch. Plains of central and eastern Siberia.
* &quot;Larix principis-rupprechtii&quot; – Prince Rupprecht&#x27;s larch. Mountains of northeastern China (disputed; accepted by Rushforth and many Chinese botanists; treated as a variety of &quot;L. gmelinii&quot; by POWO despite its disjunct distribution and much larger cones).
* &quot;Larix kaempferi&quot; (syn. &quot;L. leptolepis&quot; ) – Japanese larch. Mountains of central Japan.

==== Southern Euroasiatic species with long bracts ====
* &quot;Larix potaninii&quot; – Chinese larch. Mountains of southwestern China (southern Sichuan, northern Yunnan).
* &quot;Larix mastersiana&quot; – Masters&#x27; larch. Mountains of western China (northern Sichuan).
* &quot;Larix griffithii&quot; (syn. &quot;L. griffithiana&quot;) – Sikkim larch. Mountains of the eastern Himalayas, on the wet (high monsoon) southern slopes.
* &quot;Larix himalaica&quot; - Langtang larch. Mountains of the central Himalayas (disputed; accepted by Rushforth and the &quot;Flora of China&quot;; treated as a variety of &quot;L. potaninii&quot; by POWO despite being geographically distant from it).
* &quot;Larix kongboensis&quot; - Kongbo larch. Mountains of southeastern Tibet, on the dry northern side of the Himalaya in the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon area (disputed; accepted by the &quot;Flora of China&quot;; treated as a synonym of &quot;L. griffithii&quot; by POWO despite its smaller cones and other distinct characters).
* &quot;Larix speciosa&quot; - Burmese larch. Mountains of southwestern China (southwestern Yunnan) and northeastern Myanmar (disputed; accepted by Rushforth and the &quot;Flora of China&quot;; treated as a variety of &quot;L. griffithii&quot; by POWO despite being geographically distant from it, and closer to &quot;L. potaninii&quot; in morphology).

=== North American species ===

* &quot;Larix laricina&quot; (Du Roi) K. Koch – Tamarack or American larch. Parts of Alaska and throughout Canada and the northern United States from the eastern Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic shore.
* &quot;Larix lyallii&quot; Parl. – Subalpine larch. Mountains of northwest United States and southwest Canada, at very high altitude.
* &quot;Larix occidentalis&quot; Nutt. – Western larch. Mountains of northwest United States and southwest Canada, at lower altitudes (Pacific Northwest).

===Hybrids===
Most if not all of the species can be hybridised in cultivation; these hybrids are not discussed by POWO as they are not of natural occurrence. The hybrid &quot;Larix&quot; × &quot;marschlinsii&quot; (syn. &quot;L.&quot; × &quot;eurolepis&quot;), the Dunkeld larch, a spontaneous artificial hybrid &quot;L. decidua&quot; × &quot;L. kaempferi&quot; that arose more or less simultaneously in Switzerland and Scotland in 1901–1904, is by far the best known, being of major importance in forestry in northern Europe. &quot;Larix&quot; × &quot;pendula&quot; (&quot;L. decidua&quot; × &quot;L. laricina&quot;), and &quot;Larix&quot; × &quot;eurokurilensis&quot; (&quot;L. decidua&quot; × &quot;L. gmelinii&quot;) have also been named, but are rarely seen in cultivation.

&quot;Larix&quot; × &quot;stenophylla&quot; is another probable hybrid still unresolved.

==Ecology==

Larches are associated with a number of mycorrhizal fungal species, including some species which primarily or only associate with larch. One of the most prominent of these species is the larch bolete &quot;Suillus grevillei&quot;.

Larch is used as a food plant by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species.

==Diseases==
Larches are prone to the fungal canker disease &quot;Lachnellula ssp.&quot; (larch canker); this is particularly a problem on sites prone to late spring frosts, which cause minor injuries to the tree allowing entry to the fungal spores. In Canada, this disease was first detected in 1980 and is particularly harmful to an indigenous species larch, the tamarack, killing both young and mature trees.
Larches are also vulnerable to &quot;Phytophthora ramorum&quot;. In late 2009 the disease was first found in Japanese larch trees in the English counties of Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, and has since spread to the south-west of Scotland.
In August 2010 the disease was found in Japanese larch trees in counties Waterford and Tipperary in Ireland and in 2013 in the Afan Forest Park in south Wales.
&quot;Laricifomes officinalis&quot; is another mushroom found in Europe, North America and northern Asia that causes internal wood rot. It is almost exclusive guest of the &quot;gen. Larix&quot;. Other diseases are given by mushrooms, fungal rusts, bacteria and insects.

==Uses==
Larch wood is valued for its tough, waterproof and durable qualities. Top quality knot-free timber is in great demand for building yachts and other small boats, for exterior cladding of buildings, and interior paneling. The timber is somewhat resistant to rot when in contact with the ground, and historically was used as posts and in fencing. However, European Standard EN 350-2 lists larch as slightly to moderately durable; this would make it unsuitable for ground contact use without preservative in temperate climates, and would give it a limited life as external cladding without coatings.

The hybrid Dunkeld larch is widely grown as a timber crop in Northern Europe, valued for its fast growth and disease resistance.

Larch on oak was the traditional construction method for Scottish fishing boats in the 19th century.

Larch has also been used in herbal medicine; see Bach flower remedies and Arabinogalactan for details.

Often, in Eurasian shamanism, the &quot;world tree&quot; is depicted as specifically a larch tree. Planted on borders with birch, both tree species were used in pagan cremations.

<text>Ọrunmila (, also Ọrúnla or Orúla in Latin America) is the Orisha of Wisdom, knowledge, and Divination, is the creator of Ifá and Babalawo concept. He is a high priest of Ifá.

==Historical and literary sources==
Following the categories developed by the Nigerian scholar Peju Yemaje, Orunmila is recognized as a primordial Orisha, an &quot;ara orun&quot;, one that existed before the creation of humanity and resides in Heaven, as opposed to &quot;irun-male&quot; or &quot;irunmole&quot;, sacred beings living on Earth.

Equivocally, he is praise named &quot;&quot;Igbákejì Olódùmarè&quot; (second in command to Olodumare). In truth, he is Ibikeji Olodumare and &quot;Ẹlẹ́rìí ìpín&quot;&quot; (witness of fate). Priests of Ifá are known as babalawos and Priestesses of Ifá are known as iyanifas.

Orunmila is considered a sage, recognizing that Olodumare placed Ori (intuitive knowledge) in him as a Orisha. It is Ori who can intercede and affect the reality of a person much more than any other Orisha.

==Priesthood and initiation==
Awo in every tradition study the 256 Odu; each Odu is traditionally considered to include stories and prayers that have been passed down from the time that Orunmila walked the Earth as a prophet.

Some initiatory lineages have only male priests of Orunmila, while other lineages include female priestesses. The term &quot;Awo&quot;, meaning &quot;secret&quot; is a gender-neutral title for an initiated priest of Orunmila. The debate surrounding gender is a result of diversity in the history of Ifá in various locations. In Latin America and some areas of West Africa, only men may become full priests of Orunmila, while in other regions of West Africa the priesthood is open to women. Ifá practitioners believe in duality in life: males exist because of the female essence and females exist because of the male essence, so every major rite or ceremony includes both genders.

Every Ifá stanza has one portion dedicated to the issue of teaching the Iwa that Ifá supports. This Iwa, which Ifá teaches transcends religious doctrine, is central to every human being, and imparts communal, social and civic responsibility that Olodumare supports. Of great importance to this is the theme of righteousness and practicing good moral behavior.

<doc id="99393" wikidata="Q327300" url="?curid=99393" title="Blakeney, Norfolk">
<text>Blakeney is a coastal village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. Blakeney lies within the Norfolk Coast AONB (Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty) and the North Norfolk Heritage Coast. The North Norfolk Coastal Path travels along its quayside. The village is north west of Norwich, NNW of the larger settlement of Holt, west of Cromer and NNE of London.

The civil parish has an area of and in the 2001 census had a population of 789 in 402 households. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of North Norfolk.

==Description==

Blakeney was a commercial seaport until the early 20th century. Now the harbour is silted up, and only small boats can make their way out past Blakeney Point to the sea. Adjacent to the hill, at the foot of the village&#x27;s High Street, is the old Guildhall with a 14th-century undercroft.

Higher up the village, the Church of St Nicholas has two towers: the main tower is more than 100 ft (30 m) high and a well-known landmark for miles around; the smaller tower was built as a beacon to guide boats into Blakeney Harbour.

==History==
In the Domesday Book of 1086, Blakeney is recorded under the name Esnuterle (later, Snitterley); the main landholders are noted as Walter Gifford and William de Noyers. The settlement first appears under the name Blakeney in a document which dates from 1340. Around the same period Edward III&#x27;s wife, Queen Philippa is said to have dined on fish caught by Blakeney&#x27;s fishermen.

The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;Black island&#x27;.

===Haven===

Blakeney Haven was a deeper inlet on the north coast of Norfolk into which the River Glaven flowed. Sheltered behind Blakeney Point, it was a major shipping area in the Middle Ages, with relatively important North Norfolk ports at Wiveton, Cley next the Sea and Blakeney itself. Cley and Wiveton silted up in the 17th century, but Blakeney prospered, especially after the channel to the Haven was deepened in 1817. Packet ships ran from that port to Hull and London from 1840. This trade declined as ships became too large for the harbour, and it is now silted up with access only for small boats.

From the 12th century Blakeney had a reputation for acts of piracy: between 1328 and 1350 it is recorded that men of Blakeney boarded two vessels sailing from Flanders and sailed them back to Blakeney haven, where they were stripped of their cargoes. Many a foreign merchant ship which sought shelter in the haven found its cargo stolen. Such was the lawlessness of the residents that the village refused to supply a ship for the battle against the Spanish Armada.

===&#x27;Chapel&#x27;===

This building now in adjoining Cley next the Sea appears never to have been a chapel and may merely have been a hermitage. Indeed, the calendar of England&#x27;s Patent Rolls dated 20 April 1343, confirms a grant of alms-seeking across the realms to a local hermit.

===Friary===
This was among the junior houses of a Carmelite region (&quot;distinctio&quot;) which included Burnham Norton, King&#x27;s Lynne and Yarmouth the crypt of its senior house is intact and is converted to part of Norwich&#x27;s Printing Museum which is run by an active printing firm, Jarrold&#x27;s in the city.

The northern part of Friary Park by the seashore is a modest caravan park for visitors, with the remainder being the relatively small Friary Farm.

Friary Farmhouse incorporates remains of the Carmelite Friary founded in 1296 with its church consecrated in 1302. This was the gift of Maud de Roos or latterly de Ros, née de Vaux, wife of William de Ros, 1st Baron de Ros who distinguished himself in the Crusades, was knighted and granted land at Cley and Blakeney.

In 1321 their son, William completed the foundation.

The house has a date-stone: &quot;1667 T.R.I&quot; and is made of flint and brick with some stone quoins. Despite modern windows and most exterior work it incorporates medieval walling, a buttress, various blocked openings, fragments of window surrounds and stonework including a re-used carved kneeler on the south-west gable with coat of arms.

===Windmill===

Blakeney Mill in Friary Park is a Grade II listed building and is chiefly of flint with brick dressings (mostly its upper parts) across its three storeys. It appears on a map of 1769 in this exact location, following earlier mention from the Domesday Book of mills in the village.

==Railway==
In the 19th century a rail branch line from Holt to a new station at Blakeney was planned by the Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway. The scheme was never completed, although the junction site at High Kelling now serves as Holt station on the North Norfolk Railway. A rival proposal for a branch from Cawston to Cley and Blakeney was put forward by the East Norfolk Railway, but this was also not built.

==Tourism==
Blakeney is a popular tourist resort during the summer months. The village has two large hotels, one in a historic building, and one with a modern main part but with also with a late 17th-century and 18th-century barn annexe, The Blakeney Hotel as well as having the alternative at the end of the Quay Road of the caravan site.

Blakeney offers a large range of activities including crabbing, fishing, canoeing and birdwatching. In the area of marshland around Blakeney Point, owned by the National Trust, up to a hundred species of birds can be found throughout the year. Several pubs in the area serve food and real ale.

Wells-next-the-Sea has a miniature and heritage railway to the west.

The North Norfolk Coastal Path travels along its quayside and varies between a path through salt marshes, raised promenades, sandy beaches and compact villages in this section.

==Demography==
The population of Blakeney, according to the census of 1801, was 618. This number increased, lagging just behind national population growth in the forty years to 1851, to 1,108 however a gradual decline in population took place until 1931, particularly during the early years of this decline which coincided with the arrival of the railway at Holt to the south and national urban industrialisation – population fell from 1,108 to 641 in 1931. Population growth resumed and saw a growth between 1961 and 2011, to 801 people. Data for 1801–1961 is available at Britain Through Time. The 2001 and 2011 Censuses give detailed information about the village. The settlement&#x27;s population in 2011 were living in 407 households.

==Transport==
The village&#x27;s centre is off the northern side of the A149 coast road from King&#x27;s Lynn to Cromer, with a further part of Blakeney community directly adjoining in the residential estates south of this and also several outlying farms. The nearest railway station is at Sheringham, two villages to the east for the Bittern line to Norwich.

The nearest airport is Norwich Airport.

==War memorial==

Blakeney&#x27;s war memorial is a brick and pebble arch with two granite plaques, one commemorating the First World War and another for the Second World War. The First World War memorial lists the following 31 names:


And, C. Claxton, J. H. Long, G. A. J. Moore, C. Nicholls, J. W. Smith and H. Wright. As well as the following eight men for the Second World War:

<doc id="99394" wikidata="Q42751" url="?curid=99394" title="Palikir">
<text>Palikir () is the capital city of the Federated States of Micronesia located in the western Pacific Ocean. A town of slightly under 5,000 residents, it is part of the larger Sokehs municipality, which had a population of 6,647 , out of the nation&#x27;s total population of 106,487. It is situated on the northwest side of Pohnpei island (population 34,789), a high volcanic island surrounded by a fringing coral reef. Nearby to the northeast is the island&#x27;s largest settlement, the coastal town of Kolonia. It was declared the capital of Micronesia in 1989.

==History==
Pohnpei was ruled by tribal chiefs in ancient times. Palikir was formerly a tiny village of little consequence. The island of Pohnpei was encountered by the Portuguese and Spanish in the 15th century, but colonial settlement did not occur until 1886 by the Spanish. Later Germany attained the Caroline Islands via purchase from Spain at the end of the Spanish–American War in 1898. During World War I control passed to the Japanese. During World War II, the Japanese built an airport near Kolonia. Subsequent to World War II, the island was administered by the United States Government until FSM attained independence in 1979. The government of the Federated States of Micronesia decided to convert the Palikir area into a town to house the central administration of the islands as a purpose built capital city. It was declared the capital of Micronesia in 1989. US aid of US$15 million was made available to develop the site into a modern town. All government offices, some residential houses, and the residence of the President of the Federated States of Micronesia were built. It is now the hub of the federal administration of the country, despite still being a village with a population of 4,645.

==Geography==
Palikir is located in the northwestern center of Pohnpei Island (formerly known as Ponape). Geologically the island terrain consists of high mountains to low coral atolls. It is the largest, highest, wettest and most scenic island of the Federated States of Micronesia. Palikir is southwest of Kolonia, which is Pohnpei&#x27;s largest town and state capital of Pohnpei State. Underwater reefs are found all round the coastal region of the island. to the southeast, Mount Nanlaud is the highest point of the Federated States of Micronesia and of Pohnpei at as indicated on the definitive USGS 1:25,000 scale topographic survey. Palikir is surrounded by heavily wooded forest.

==Climate==
Palikir features a tropical rainforest climate under the Köppen climate classification. Common to many areas with this climate, Palikir sees very little variance in its temperatures during the course of the year, averaging roughly daily throughout the year. The town experiences heavy rainfall year-round; on average of rain falls annually, making it the wettest capital in the world.

==Demographics==
The nationality of the people is Micronesian with the most common ethnicities being Chuukese, Kosraeans, Pohnpeian, and Yapese. English is the common and official language while each of the major islands have their own local language such as Chuukese, Kosraean, Pohnpeian, and Yapese. 96% of the population is Christian with Roman Catholicism being the majority religion at over 50% of the population. The city has been categorized as having a &quot;high degree of hardship with a typical hardship premium of 30%&quot; from an international perspective.

==Administration==
Since 1989, Palikir has been the federal capital of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), which attained independence from, and remains since in free association with, the United States in May 1979. FSM has a constitutional government headed by a president.

==Economy==
The economy of the capital city is reflected in the economic resources of the FSM Islands (600 islands, atolls and islets (including Pohnpei Island)) as a whole. The economy of the island consists basically of subsistence farming and fishing (fish processing and aquaculture). Tropical agricultural and plantation products like copra, breadfruit, taro, betel nuts, sweet potatoes, cassava, tropical fruits and vegetables, trochus shells, cacao and rice are produced. Livestock, such as pigs and poultry, are raised. Products such as fish, bananas, black pepper, and garments are mainly exported to Japan. Food, manufactured goods, machinery and equipment, and beverages are imported.

The country is independent, but in fact depends on financial support stemming from its Compact of Free Association with the US. the inflation rate was 2% and the cost of living (for imported goods) in Palikir is reportedly very high in comparison with other places in the world.

==Education==
Pohnpei State Department of Education operates public schools:
* Palikir Elementary School

Bailey Olter High School (former Pohnpei Island Central School or PICS) in Kolonia serves students from Sokehs.

==Notable people==
* Emelihter Kihleng, poet
* Bailey Olter, politician

==Transportation==
Pohnpei International Airport is close to Palikir.

<text>A bad trip (also known as challenging experiences, acute intoxication from hallucinogens, psychedelic crisis, or emergence phenomenon) is an acute adverse psychological reaction to the effects of psychoactive substances, namely psychedelics. There is no clear definition of what constitutes a bad trip. Additionally, knowledge on the cause of bad trips and who may be vulnerable to such experiences are limited. Existing studies report that possible adverse reactions include anxiety, panic, depersonalization, ego dissolution, paranoia, as well as physiological symptoms such as dizziness and heart palpitations. However, most studies indicate that the &quot;set and setting&quot; of substance use influence how people respond.

Bad trips can be exacerbated by the inexperience or irresponsibility of the user or the lack of proper preparation and environment for the trip, and are often reflective of unresolved psychological tensions triggered during the course of the experience. In clinical research settings, precautions including the screening and preparation of participants, the training of the session monitors who will be present during the experience, and the selection of appropriate physical setting can minimize the likelihood of psychological distress. Researchers have suggested that the presence of professional &quot;trip sitters&quot; (i.e., session monitors) may significantly reduce the negative experiences associated with a bad trip. In most cases in which anxiety arises during a supervised psychedelic experience, reassurance from the session monitor is adequate to resolve it; however, if distress becomes intense it can be treated pharmacologically, for example with the benzodiazepine diazepam.

The psychiatrist Stanislav Grof wrote that unpleasant psychedelic experiences are not necessarily unhealthy or undesirable, arguing that they may have the potential for psychological healing and lead to breakthrough and resolution of unresolved psychic issues. Drawing on narrative theory, the authors of a 2021 study of 50 users of psychedelics found that many described bad trips as having been sources of insight or even turning points in life.

== Signs and symptoms ==

With proper screening, preparation, and support in a regulated setting these are usually benign. A bad trip on psilocybin, for instance, often features intense anxiety, confusion, agitation, and psychosis. They manifest as a range of feelings, such as anxiety, paranoia, the unshakeable sense of one&#x27;s inevitable and imminent personal demise or states of unrelieved terror that they believe will persist after the substance&#x27;s effects have worn off. As of 2011, exact data on the frequency of bad trips are not available.

== Treatment ==

Medical treatment consists of supportive therapy and minimization of external stimuli. In some cases, sedation is used when necessary to control self-destructive behavior, or when hyperthermia occurs. Diazepam is the most frequently used sedative for such treatment, but other benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are also effective. Such sedatives will only decrease fear and anxiety, but will not subdue hallucinations. In severe cases, antipsychotics such as haloperidol can reduce or stop hallucinations. Haloperidol is effective against acute intoxication caused by LSD and other tryptamines, amphetamines, ketamine, and phencyclidine.

== Pathophysiology ==

Bad trips may cause range of conditions such as psychosis and hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD). 
==Perspectives==

===Stanislav Grof===
Psychiatrist Stanislav Grof once said in an interview:

In a 1975 book, Grof suggested that painful and difficult experiences during a trip could be a result of the mind reliving experiences associated with birth, and that experiences of imprisonment, eschatological terror, or suffering far beyond anything imaginable in a normal state, if seen through to conclusion, often resolve into emotional, intellectual and spiritual breakthroughs. From this perspective, Grof suggests that interrupting a bad trip, while initially seen as beneficial, could potentially trap the tripper in unresolved psychological states. Grof also suggests that many cathartic experiences within psychedelic states, while not necessarily crises, may be the effects of consciousness entering a perinatal space.

===Rick Strassman===
Professor of psychiatry Rick Strassman is critical of reframing the experience of bad trips as one of &quot;challenging experiences&quot;.

<text>Èṣù is a pivotal Òrìṣà/Irúnmọlẹ̀ in the Yoruba spirituality or Yoruba religion known as ìṣẹ̀ṣe. Èṣù is a prominent primordial Divinity (a delegated Irúnmọlẹ̀ sent by the Olódùmarè) who descended from Ìkọ̀lé Ọ̀run, and the Chief Enforcer of natural and divine laws – he is the Deity in charge of law enforcement and orderliness. As the religion has spread around the world, the name of this Orisha has varied in different locations, but the beliefs remain similar.

== Overview ==
The other names of the Irúnmọlẹ̀ called Èṣù includes; &quot;Ẹlẹ́jẹ̀lú&quot;, &quot;Olúlànà&quot;, &quot;Ọbasìn&quot;, &quot;Láarúmọ̀&quot;, &quot;Ajọ́ńgọ́lọ̀&quot;, &quot;Ọba Ọ̀dàrà,&quot; &quot;Onílé Oríta&quot;, &quot;Ẹlẹ́gbára Ọ̀gọ&quot;, &quot;Olóògùn Àjíṣà&quot;, &quot;Láàlú Ògiri Òkò&quot;, &quot;Láàlù Bara Ẹlẹ́jọ́&quot;, &quot;Láaróyè Ẹbọra tí jẹ́ Látọpa&quot;.

Èṣù is powerful, relevant, and ubiquitous to the extent of having every day of the four-day (ancient/traditional) Yorùbá week as his day of worship (&quot;Ọjọ́ Ọ̀ṣẹ̀&quot;), unlike all other Irúnmọlẹ̀s and Òrìṣàs (primordial Divinities and deified Ancestor Spirits; &quot;ọjọ́ gbogbo ni ti Èṣù Ọ̀darà&quot;).

The controversial cognomen; A-bá-ni-wá-ọ̀ràn-bá-ò-rí-dá (He-who-creates-problems-for-the-innocent) highlights the complexity of the nature of this highly unpredictable Deity called Èṣù Ọba Ọ̀dàrà (who has his abode at crossroads) across all strata of Yorùbá society in general and of spiritual communities in particular.

Èṣù is the messenger not only to the Olódùmarè, but also to the other Irúnmọlẹ̀s/Òrìṣàs. He is also the intermediary between &quot;Ajoguns&quot; (evil spirits) to the Irúnmọlẹ̀s/Òrìṣàs and the &quot;ẹ̀dá èèyàn&quot; (human beings); he is the one who distributes, and also supervises the distribution of sacrifices (&quot;ẹbọ&quot;) to the Ajoguns.

In some Yoruba traditions amulets in the form of Eshu covered with divination boards are used.

==Name and role==

Èṣùu partially serves as an alternate name for Eleggua, the messenger for all Orishas, and that there are 256 paths to Eleggua—each one of which is an Eshu. It is believed that Èṣù of the ìṣẹ̀ṣe Religion is an Òrìṣà similar to Eleggua, but there are only 101 paths to Eshu according to ocha, rather than the 256 paths to Eleggua according to Ifá. Èṣù is known as the &quot;Father who gave birth to Ogboni&quot;, and is also thought to be agile and always willing to rise to a challenge.

Both ocha and Ifá share some paths, however. Eshu Ayé is said to work closely with all Òrìṣà including Òrìṣà Olokun and is thought to walk on the shore of the beach. Èṣù Bi is a stern and forceful avatar, appearing as both an old man and young boy, who walked with Shangó and Oyá (the initial two Ibeyi), and Eshu Bi protects both of these, as well as all other small children. Eshu Laroye is an avatar believed to be the companion of Oshún and believed to be one of the most important Eshus, and the avatar of Eshu Laroye is thought to be talkative and small.

Èṣù is always at the middle of divergent world forces. He controls and regulates the two extremes – the world of happiness, joy, and fulfilment, as well as the arena of destruction, hopelessness, and sorrow.

Èṣù always demands from those who have to give to those demanded for it within the premises of sacrifices, rituals, and propitiation. He maintains the delicate balance of good and bad – just and unjust. He protects towns and villages, Priests and Priestess (&quot;àwọn Ẹlẹ́gùn - tí wọ́n ní ẹ̀rẹ́ ní Ìpàkọ́&quot;), and Devotees and Awos against evil machinations, always favouring those that performed the necessary and appropriate sacrifices (&quot;ẹbọs&quot;) and other forms of rituals; &quot;ẹni tó bá rúbọ l&#x27;Èṣù ń gbè&quot;! 

Èṣù Láàlù is a bosom friend, working partner, confidant, and close associate of Ọ̀rúnmìlà Baraà mi Àgbọnnìrègún, the one who practises and teaches Ifá, an esoteric language of Olódùmarè (containing divine message of life) through a very complex divinatory system, and who also teaches wisdom. 

==Other names==
The name of Eshu varies around the world: in Yorùbáland, Eshu is &quot;Èṣù-Elegba&quot; or Laalu-Ogiri Oko; &quot;Exu de Candomblé&quot; in Candomblé; &quot;Echú&quot; in Santería and Latin America; &quot;Legba&quot; in Haitian Vodou; &quot;Leba&quot; in Winti; &quot;Exu de Quimbanda&quot; in Quimbanda; &quot;Obi&quot; in Birongo, &quot;Lucero&quot; in Palo Mayombe; and &quot;Exu&quot; in Latin America.

==Brazil==
Exu is known by various forms and names in Afro-Brazilian religions. They include Akesan; Alafiá; Alaketo; Bará, or Ibará; Elegbá, or Elegbará, Inan; Lalu, or Jelu; Laroyê; Lon Bií; Lonã; Odara; Olodé; Tamenta, or Etamitá; Tiriri. The most common forms or praise-names of Exu are Exu-Agbo, the protector and guardian of houses and terreiros; Exu-Elepô, the god of palm oil; Exu lnã, the god of fire; and Exu Ojixé, a messenger god.

===Candomblé===
A shrine dedicated to Exu is located outside of the main terreiro of a Candomblé temple, usually near the entrance gate. It is, in general, made of a simple mound of red clay. These shrines are similar to those found in Nigeria.

Ritual foods offered to Exu include palm oil; beans; corn, either in the form of cornmeal or popcorn; and farofa, a manioc flour. Male birds, four-legged and other animals are offered as sacrifice to Exu. In each offering made to an orixá, a part of the food is separated and dedicated to Exu.

===Umbanda===
In the syncretic religion of Umbanda, Exu may have a different meaning. Usually in Umbanda Exu is not considered a single Deity, but many different spirits. Some of the most popular Exus are Exu Caveira (&quot;Skull Exu&quot;, represented as a skeleton), Exu Tranca-Rua (&quot;Street Locker&quot;, opener and closer of spiritual ways) and Exu Mirim (&quot;Little Exu&quot;, a spirit that resembles the personality of a child or teenager). In Umbanda, a Pombagira (female consort of Exu) may also be considered a kind of Exu, commonly venerated in the practice of Brazilian Love magic.

==Mistranslation in the English language and on Google==
Translational errors of English speaking missionaries resulted in the Yorùbá word Èṣù being rendered and returned as &quot;devil&quot; or &quot;satan&quot; in the mid nineteenth century. The first known instance of this came from the freed slave turned Christian, Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther&#x27;s &quot;Vocabulary of the Yoruba&quot; (1842) where his entries for &quot;Satan&quot; and “devil” had Esu in English. Subsequent dictionaries over the years have followed suit, permeating popular culture and Yorùbá societies as well. Lately, many online campaigns have been set up to protest this, and many activists have worked to correct it. There have also been quite a number of academic work examining the mistranslation.

The translation on Google Translate took up the same earlier mistranslations. This led to a number of online campaigns until 2016 when Nigerian linguist and writer Kola Tubosun, then an employee at Google, first changed it back to less derogatory connotations. When the changes were reverted, he changed them again in 2019. The translation for Èṣù to English now remains &quot;Èṣù&quot; while &quot;devil&quot; and &quot;satan&quot; translate to &quot;bìlísì&quot; and &quot;sàtánì&quot; respectively. Tubosun&#x27;s 2024 collection of poetry &quot;Èṣù at the Library&quot; pays literary homage to this episode.

==Appearances in popular culture==

==Economy==

Due to the proximity of numerous lakes, rivers and mountains, Post Falls has developed tourism and retirement communities. There is an increasing number of retail, dining and entertainment businesses locating in the City.

Kootenai County traditionally has had a timber-based economy. That is changing gradually, as the manufacturing base has become more diverse. Jobs Plus, Inc., the local economic development organization has recruited several small to medium-sized firms to the county. Manufacturing jobs are found primarily in electronics, lumber and furniture at the present. Post Falls was the chosen location for Flexcel, Inc., a major furniture manufacturer that relocated to North Idaho nearly fifteen years ago and employs a workforce of 350. This was done with the help of Jobs Plus, Inc. and by creating an Urban Renewal District to help build infrastructure. This District closed out at the end of December 2001. Jobs Plus, Inc. has also just recently helped bring Center Partners, a call center business (employing a workforce of 300), and Buck Knives brought their manufacturing headquarters (workforce of 250) to the City. 

Construction of a private surgical hospital was completed in 2004. Sysco foods opened their distribution plant during 2005. This project was made possible by Jobs Plus, Urban Renewal, and the City working together. Also, a community development block grant for $500,000 was used to help fund a water tower (approximately $1,500,000 total cost) that was needed on the west side of town for development in that area. In 2007, Cabela&#x27;s opened its doors to a beautiful retail store. Considerable economic development activity transpired in Post Falls in 2009 including the opening of ALK Source Materials/Biopol which is a Danish pharmaceutical company, a second Super Wal-Mart store that will be located near the new Cabela&#x27;s store began its construction and is slated to open in early summer 2010, and Lowe&#x27;s Home Improvement finalized the purchase of land adjacent to the new Wal-Mart at the Pointe at Post Falls. Ground Force Manufacturing, a large construction equipment manufacturer, completed an addition that increased their production space by in 2009 in order to meet the heavy demands for their mining construction products around the globe. In 2010, additional commercial real estate activity is anticipated including the construction of the Lowe&#x27;s Home Improvement store mentioned earlier; a new 30,000 professional office building to house a company named Ednetics; a 30,000 LEED certified industrial building to be the home of a subsidiary of Berg Integrated Systems will begin construction in early 2010; the Idaho Department of Labor will construct their new regional office here in Post Falls that will provide services to the northern five counties of Idaho; several restaurants are also anticipated to locate within the Pointe at Post Falls regional power center to take advantage of the retail traffic of Cabela&#x27;s and Wal-Mart; the City&#x27;s downtown area is expected to see a major mixed-use project also take off with infrastructure and the first phase including a hospitality component begin construction; and finally the community anticipates that construction on the Beck Road Interchange with Interstate 90 will begin this fall ultimately providing service to the Pointe at Post Falls and EXPO on the north side of the freeway and the Riverbend Commerce Park and Greyhound Event Center on the south side of Interstate 90.

<doc id="99404" wikidata="Q184624" url="?curid=99404" title="Peat">
<text>Peat is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation or organic matter. It is unique to natural areas called peatlands, bogs, mires, moors, or muskegs. &quot;Sphagnum&quot; moss, also called peat moss, is one of the most common components in peat, although many other plants can contribute. The biological features of sphagnum mosses act to create a habitat aiding peat formation, a phenomenon termed &#x27;habitat manipulation&#x27;. Soils consisting primarily of peat are known as histosols. Peat forms in wetland conditions, where flooding or stagnant water obstructs the flow of oxygen from the atmosphere, slowing the rate of decomposition. Peat properties such as organic matter content and saturated hydraulic conductivity can exhibit high spatial heterogeneity.
Peatlands, particularly bogs, are the primary source of peat; although less common, other wetlands, including fens, pocosins and peat swamp forests, also deposit peat. Landscapes covered in peat are home to specific kinds of plants, including &quot;Sphagnum&quot; moss, ericaceous shrubs and sedges. Because organic matter accumulates over thousands of years, peat deposits provide records of past vegetation and climate by preserving plant remains, such as pollen. This allows the reconstruction of past environments and the study of land-use changes.

Peat is used by gardeners and for horticulture in certain parts of the world, but this is being banned in some places. By volume, there are about 4 trillion cubic metres of peat in the world. Over time, the formation of peat is often the first step in the geological formation of fossil fuels such as coal, particularly low-grade coal such as lignite. The peatland ecosystem covers and is the most efficient carbon sink on the planet, because peatland plants capture carbon dioxide (CO2) naturally released from the peat, maintaining an equilibrium. In natural peatlands, the &quot;annual rate of biomass production is greater than the rate of decomposition&quot;, but it takes &quot;thousands of years for peatlands to develop the deposits of , which is the average depth of the boreal [northern] peatlands&quot;, which store around 415 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon (about 46 times 2019 global CO2 emissions). Globally, peat stores up to 550 Gt of carbon, 42% of all soil carbon, which exceeds the carbon stored in all other vegetation types, including the world&#x27;s forests, although it covers just 3% of the land&#x27;s surface.

Peat is a renewable source of energy in theory, but not in practice, due to its extraction rate in industrialized countries far exceeding its slow regrowth rate of per year, and as it is also reported that peat regrowth takes place only in 30–40% of peatlands. Centuries of burning and draining of peat by humans has released a significant amount of into the atmosphere, and much peatland restoration is needed to help limit climate change.

==Formation==

Peat forms when plant material does not fully decay in acidic and anaerobic conditions. It is composed mainly of wetland vegetation: principally bog plants including mosses, sedges and shrubs. As it accumulates, the peat holds water. This slowly creates wetter conditions that allow the area of wetland to expand. Peatland features can include ponds, ridges and raised bogs. The characteristics of some bog plants actively promote bog formation. For example, sphagnum mosses actively secrete tannins, which preserve organic material. Sphagnum also have special water-retaining cells, known as hyaline cells, which can release water ensuring the bogland remains constantly wet which helps promote peat production.

Most modern peat bogs formed 12,000 years ago in high latitudes after the glaciers retreated at the end of the last ice age. Peat usually accumulates slowly at the rate of about a millimetre per year. The estimated carbon content is (northern peatlands), (tropical peatlands) and (South America).

==Types of peat material==
Peat material is either fibric, hemic, or sapric. Fibric peats are the least decomposed and consist of intact fibre. Hemic peats are partially decomposed and sapric are the most decomposed.

&quot;Phragmites&quot; peat are composed of reed grass, &quot;Phragmites australis&quot;, and other grasses. It is denser than many other types of peat.

Engineers may describe a soil as peat which has a relatively high percentage of organic material. This soil is problematic because it exhibits poor consolidation properties—it cannot be easily compacted to serve as a stable foundation to support loads, such as roads or buildings.

== Peatlands distribution ==
In a widely cited article, Joosten and Clarke (2002) described peatlands or mires (which they say are the same) asthe most widespread of all wetland types in the world, representing 50 to 70% of global wetlands. They cover over or 3% of the land and freshwater surface of the planet. In these ecosystems are found one third of the world&#x27;s soil carbon and 10% of global freshwater resources. These ecosystems are characterized by the unique ability to accumulate and store dead organic matter from Sphagnum and many other non-moss species, as peat, under conditions of almost permanent water saturation. Peatlands are adapted to the extreme conditions of high water and low oxygen content, of toxic elements and low availability of plant nutrients. Their water chemistry varies from alkaline to acidic. Peatlands occur on all continents, from the tropical to boreal and Arctic zones from sea level to high alpine conditions.

A more recent estimate from an improved global peatland map, PEATMAP, based on a meta-analysis of geospatial information at global, regional and national levels puts global coverage slightly higher than earlier peatland inventories at approximately 2.84% of the world land area. In Europe, peatlands extend to about . About 60% of the world&#x27;s wetlands are made of peat.

Peat deposits are found in many places around the world, including northern Europe and North America. The North American peat deposits are principally found in Canada and the Northern United States. Some of the world&#x27;s largest peatlands include the West Siberian Lowland, the Hudson Bay Lowlands and the Mackenzie River Valley.
There is less peat in the Southern Hemisphere, in part because there is less land. The world&#x27;s largest tropical peatland is located in Africa (the Democratic Republic of Congo). In addition, the vast Magellanic Moorland in South America (Southern Patagonia/Tierra del Fuego) is an extensive peat-dominated landscape. Peat can be found in New Zealand, Kerguelen, the Falkland Islands and Indonesia (Kalimantan [Sungai Putri, Danau Siawan, Sungai Tolak], Rasau Jaya (West Kalimantan) and Sumatra). Indonesia has more tropical peatlands and mangrove forests than any other nation on earth, but Indonesia is losing wetlands by per year. A catalog of the peat research collection at the University of Minnesota Duluth provides references to research on worldwide peat and peatlands.

About 7% of all peatlands have been exploited for agriculture and forestry. Under certain conditions, peat will turn into lignite coal over geologic periods of time.

==General uses==

=== Fuel ===
Peat can be used as fuel once dried. Traditionally, peat is cut by hand and left to dry in the sun. In many countries, including Ireland and Scotland, peat was traditionally stacked to dry in rural areas and used for cooking and domestic heating. This tradition can be traced back to the Roman period. For industrial uses, companies may use pressure to extract water from the peat, which is soft and easily compressed.

===Agriculture===
In Sweden, farmers use dried peat to absorb excrement from cattle that are wintered indoors. The most essential property of peat is retaining moisture in container soil when it is dry while preventing the excess water from killing roots when it is wet. Peat can store nutrients although it is not fertile itself—it is polyelectrolytic with a high ion-exchange capacity due to its oxidized lignin. Peat is discouraged as a soil amendment by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England, since 2003. While bark or coir-based peat-free potting soil mixes are on the rise, particularly in the UK, peat is still used as raw material for horticulture in some other European countries, Canada, as well as parts of the United States.

=== Drinking water ===
Peatland can also be an essential source of drinking water, providing nearly 4% of all potable water stored in reservoirs. In the UK, 43% of the population receives drinking water sourced from peatlands, with the number climbing to 68% in Ireland. Catchments containing peatlands are the main source of water for large cities, including Dublin.

=== Metallurgy ===
Peat wetlands also used to have a degree of metallurgical importance in the Early Middle Ages, being the primary source of bog iron used to create swords and armour.

=== Flood mitigation ===
Many peat swamps along the coast of Malaysia serve as a natural means of flood mitigation, with any overflow being absorbed by the peat, provided forests are still present to prevent peat fires.

===Freshwater aquaria===
Peat is sometimes used in freshwater aquaria. It is seen most commonly in soft water or blackwater river systems such as those mimicking the Amazon River basin. In addition to being soft and therefore suitable for demersal (bottom-dwelling) species such as &quot;Corydoras&quot; catfish, peat is reported to have many other beneficial functions in freshwater aquaria. It softens water by acting as an ion exchanger; it also contains substances that are beneficial for plants and fishes&#x27; reproductive health. Peat can prevent algae growth and kill microorganisms. Peat often stains the water yellow or brown due to the leaching of tannins.

===Balneotherapy===
Peat is widely used in balneotherapy (the use of bathing to treat disease). Many traditional spa treatments include peat as part of peloids. Such health treatments have an enduring tradition in European countries, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany and Austria. Some of these old spas date back to the 18th century and are still active today. The most common types of peat application in balneotherapy are peat muds, poultices and suspension baths.

=== Peat archives ===
Authors Rydin and Jeglum in &quot;Biology of Habitats&quot; described the concept of peat archives, a phrase coined by influential peatland scientist Harry Godwin in 1981.

In &quot;Quaternary Palaeoecology&quot;, first published in 1980, Birks and Birks described how paleoecological studies &quot;of peat can be used to reveal what plant communities were present (locally and regionally), what period each community occupied, how environmental conditions changed, and how the environment affected the ecosystem in that time and place.&quot;

Scientists continue to compare modern mercury (Hg) accumulation rates in bogs with historical natural archives records in peat bogs and lake sediments to estimate the potential human impacts on the biogeochemical cycle of mercury, for example. Over the years, different dating models and technologies for measuring date sediments and peat profiles accumulated over the last 100–150 years, have been used, including the widely used vertical distribution of 210Pb, the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-SMS), and more recently the initial penetration (IP).

==== Bog bodies ====

Naturally mummified human bodies, often called &quot;bog bodies&quot; have been found in various places in Scotland, England, Ireland, and especially northern Germany and Denmark. They are almost perfectly preserved by the tanning properties of the acidic water, as well as by the antibiotic properties of the organic component sphagnan. A famous example is the Tollund Man in Denmark. Having been discovered in 1950 after being mistaken for a recent murder victim, he was exhumed for scientific purposes and dated to have lived during the 4th century BC. Before that, another bog body, the Elling Woman, had been discovered in 1938 in the same bog about from the Tollund Man. She is believed to have lived during the late 3rd century BC and was a ritual sacrifice. In the Bronze and Iron Ages, people used peat bogs for rituals to nature gods and spirits.

==Environmental and ecological issues==
The distinctive ecological conditions of peat wetlands provide a habitat for distinctive fauna and flora. For example, whooping cranes nest in North American peatlands, whilst Siberian cranes nest in the West Siberian peatland. Palsa mires have a rich bird life and are an EU-red listed habitat, and in Canada riparian peat banks are used as maternity sites for polar bears. Natural peatlands also have many species of wild orchids and carnivorous plants. For more on biological communities, see wetland, bog or fen.

Around half of the area of northern peatlands is permafrost-affected, and this area represents around a tenth of the total permafrost area, and also a tenth (185 ± 66 Gt) of all permafrost carbon, equivalent to around half of the carbon stored in the atmosphere. Dry peat is a good insulator (with a thermal conductivity of around 0.25 Wm−1K−1) and therefore plays an important role in protecting permafrost from thaw. The insulating effect of dry peat also makes it integral to unique permafrost landforms such as palsas and permafrost peat plateaus. Peatland permafrost thaw tends to result in an increase in methane emissions and a small increase in carbon dioxide uptake, meaning that it contributes to the permafrost carbon feedback. Under 2 °C global warming, 0.7 million km2 of peatland permafrost could thaw, and with warming of +1.5 to 6 °C a cumulative 0.7 to 3 PgC of methane could be released as a result of permafrost peatland thaw by 2100. The forcing from these potential emissions would be approximately equivalent to 1% of projected anthropogenic emissions.

One characteristic of peat is the bioaccumulation of metals concentrated in the peat. Accumulated mercury is of significant environmental concern.

===Peat drainage===
Large areas of organic wetland (peat) soils are currently drained for agriculture, forestry and peat extraction (i.e. through canals). This process is taking place all over the world. This not only destroys the habitat of many species but also heavily fuels climate change. As a result of peat drainage, the organic carbon—which built over thousands of years and is normally underwater—is suddenly exposed to the air. It decomposes and turns into carbon dioxide (), which is released into the atmosphere. The global emissions from drained peatlands have increased from 1,058 Mton in 1990 to 1,298 Mton in 2008 (a 20% increase). This increase has particularly taken place in developing countries, of which Indonesia, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea are the fastest-growing top emitters. This estimate excludes emissions from peat fires (conservative estimates amount to at least 4,000 Mton/-eq./yr for south-east Asia). With 174 Mton/-eq./yr, the EU is after Indonesia (500 Mton) and before Russia (161 Mton), the world&#x27;s second-largest emitter of drainage-related peatland (excl. extracted peat and fires). Total emissions from the worldwide 500,000 km2 of degraded peatland may exceed 2.0 Gtons (including emissions from peat fires), which is almost 6% of all global carbon emissions.

=== Peat fires===

Peat can be a major fire hazard and is not extinguished by light rain. may burn for great lengths of time, or smoulder underground and reignite after winter if an oxygen source is present.

Peat has a high carbon content and can burn under low moisture conditions. Once ignited by the presence of a heat source (e.g., a wildfire penetrating the subsurface), it smoulders. These smouldering fires can burn undetected for very long periods of time (months, years, and even centuries) propagating in a creeping fashion through the underground peat layer.

Despite the damage that the burning of raw peat can cause, bogs are naturally subject to wildfires and depend on the wildfires to keep woody competition from lowering the water table and shading out many bog plants. Several families of plants including the carnivorous &quot;Sarracenia&quot; (trumpet pitcher), &quot;Dionaea&quot; (Venus flytrap), &quot;Utricularia&quot; (bladderworts) and non-carnivorous plants such as the sandhills lily, toothache grass and many species of orchid are now threatened and in some cases endangered from the combined forces of human drainage, negligence and absence of fire.

The recent burning of peat bogs in Indonesia, with their large and deep growths containing more than of carbon, has contributed to increases in world carbon dioxide levels. Peat deposits in Southeast Asia could be destroyed by 2040.

It is estimated that in 1997, peat and forest fires in Indonesia released between of carbon; equivalent to 13–40 percent of the amount released by global fossil fuel burning, and greater than the carbon uptake of the world&#x27;s biosphere. These fires may be responsible for the acceleration in the increase in carbon dioxide levels since 1998. More than 100 peat fires in Kalimantan and East Sumatra have continued to burn since 1997; each year, these peat fires ignite new forest fires above the ground.

In North America, peat fires can occur during severe droughts throughout their occurrence, from boreal forests in Canada to swamps and fens in the subtropical southern Florida Everglades. Once a fire has burnt through the area, hollows in the peat are burnt out, and hummocks are desiccated but can contribute to &quot;Sphagnum&quot; recolonization.

In the summer of 2010, an unusually high heat wave of up to ignited large deposits of peat in Central Russia, burning thousands of houses and covering the capital of Moscow with a toxic smoke blanket. The situation remained critical until the end of August 2010.

In June 2019, despite some forest fire prevention methods being put in place, peat fires in the Arctic emitted of CO2, which is equal to Sweden&#x27;s total annual emissions. The peat fires are linked to climate change, as they are much more likely to occur nowadays due to this effect.

=== Erosion: Peat hags ===
Peat &quot;hags&quot; are a form of erosion that occur at the sides of gullies that cut into the peat; they sometimes also occur in isolation. Hags may result when flowing water cuts downwards into the peat and when fire or overgrazing exposes the peat surface. Once the peat is exposed in these ways, it is prone to further erosion by wind, water and livestock. The result is overhanging vegetation and peat. Hags are too steep and unstable for vegetation to establish itself, so they continue to erode unless restorative action is taken.

==Protection==
In June 2002, the United Nations Development Programme launched the Wetlands Ecosystem and Tropical Peat Swamp Forest Rehabilitation Project. This project was targeted to last for five years, and brings together the efforts of various non-government organisations.

In November 2002, the International Peatland (formerly Peat) Society (IPS) and the International Mire Conservation Group (IMCG) published guidelines on the &quot;Wise Use of Mires and Peatlands – Backgrounds and Principles including a framework for decision-making&quot;. This publication aims to develop mechanisms that can balance the conflicting demands on the global peatland heritage to ensure its wise use to meet the needs of humankind.

In June 2008, the IPS published the book &quot;Peatlands and Climate Change&quot;, summarising the currently available knowledge on the topic. In 2010, IPS presented a &quot;Strategy for Responsible Peatland Management&quot;, which can be applied worldwide for decision-making.

Peat extraction is forbidden in Chile since April 2024.

==Characteristics and uses by nation==
===Latvia===

Latvia has been the biggest exporter of peat in the world by volume, providing more than 19.9% of the world&#x27;s volume, followed only by Canada with 13% in 2022. In 2020, Latvia exported 1.97 million tons of peat, followed by Germany with 1.5 and Canada with 1.42 million tons. Nevertheless, although first in the world by volume, in monetary terms, Latvian comes second in the world behind Canada. As an example, Latvia&#x27;s income from exports was US$237 million.

Latvia&#x27;s peat deposits have been estimated to equal 1.7 billion tons. Latvia, as Finland due its climate has several peat bogs, which account for 9.9% of the country&#x27;s territory.

More than two thirds of the licensed areas for peat extraction are state-owned; 55% belong to the state whilst 23% belong to the municipalities

Bogs in Latvia are considered important habitats due to their ecological values, and up to 128,000 hectares, or 40% of the areas in the territory, are protected by environmental laws. The most famous national parks and reserves are the Ķemeri National Park, Cenas tīrelis and Teiči Nature Reserve.

===Finland===

The climate, geography and environment of Finland favours bog and peat bog formation. Thus, peat is available in considerable quantities. It is burned to produce heat and electricity. Peat provides around 4% of Finland&#x27;s annual energy production.

Also, agricultural and forestry-drained peat bogs actively release more CO2 annually than is released in peat energy production in Finland. The average regrowth rate of a single peat bog, however, is indeed slow, from 1,000 up to 5,000 years. Furthermore, it is a common practice to forest used peat bogs instead of giving them a chance to renew. This leads to lower levels of CO2 storage than the original peat bog.

At 106 g CO2/MJ, the carbon dioxide emissions of peat are higher than those of coal (at 94.6 g CO2/MJ) and natural gas (at 56.1). According to one study, increasing the average amount of wood in the fuel mixture from the current 2.6% to 12.5% would take the emissions down to 93 g CO2/MJ. That said, little effort is being made to achieve this.

The International Mire Conservation Group (IMCG) in 2006 urged the local and national governments of Finland to protect and conserve the remaining pristine peatland ecosystems. This includes the cessation of drainage and peat extraction in intact mire sites and the abandoning of current and planned groundwater extraction that may affect these sites. A proposal for a Finnish peatland management strategy was presented to the government in 2011, after a lengthy consultation phase.

=== Sweden ===

About 15% of the land in Sweden is covered by peatlands. Whilst nowadays the main use of such soils is for forestry, peat-rich lands have historically been exploited to produce energy, agricultural land and horticultural substrates. The most common method to extract peat during the 19th and 20th centuries was peat cutting, a process where the land is cleared of forest and subsequently drained. Peat cores are then extracted under dry weather conditions and stored on stacks to let the residual moisture evaporate. Today, clear-cutting for horticultural peat (of which Sweden is an important producer in Europe) is limited to some areas of Sweden and strictly regulated by the Swedish Environmental Code to prevent that significant groundwater storages and carbon sinks areas are altered and compromised by human activities. At the same time, restoration of drained peatlands through rewetting is urged by national and international policies to exploit the peat-rich soil properties in mitigating climate change effects.

===Ireland===

In the Republic of Ireland, a state-owned company called was responsible for managing peat extraction. It processed the extracted peat into milled peat used in power stations and sold processed peat fuel in the form of peat briquettes, which is used for domestic heating. These are oblong bars of densely compressed, dried, and shredded peat. Peat moss is a manufactured product for garden cultivation. Turf (dried-out peat sods) is also commonly used in rural areas.

In January 2021, Bord na Móna announced that it had ceased all peat harvesting and cutting operations and would move its business to a climate solutions company.

In 2022, selling peat for burning was prohibited, but some people are still allowed to cut and burn it.

===Russia===

The use of peat for energy production was prominent in the Soviet Union, especially in 1965. In 1929, over 40% of the Soviet Union&#x27;s electric energy came from peat, which dropped to 1% by 1980.

In the 1960s, larger sections of swamps and bogs in Western Russia were drained for agricultural and mining purposes.

===Netherlands===
Two-and-a-half thousand years ago, the area now named the Netherlands was largely covered with peat. Drainage, causing compaction and oxidation and excavation have reduced peatlands (&gt; peat) to about or 10% of the land area, mostly used as meadows. Drainage and excavation have lowered the surface of the peatlands. In the west of the country, dikes and mills were built, creating polders so that dwelling and economic activities could continue below sea level, the first polder probably in 1533 and the last one in 1968.
Peat harvesting could continue in suitable locations as the lower layers below the current sea level are exposed. This peat was deposited before the sea level rise in the Holocene. As a result, approximately 26% of the area and 21% of the population of the Netherlands are presently below sea level. The deepest point is in the Zuidplaspolder, below average sea level. 

In 2020, the Netherlands imported 2,156 million kg of peat (5.39 million m3 [400 kg/m3 dry peat]): 44.5% from Germany (2020), 9.5% from Estonia (2018), 9.2% from Latvia (2020), 7.2% from Ireland (2018), 8.0% from Sweden (2019), 6.5% from Lithuania (2020), 5.1% from Belgium (2019) and 1.7% from Denmark (2019); 1.35 million kg was exported. Most is used in gardening and greenhouse horticulture.

Since the Netherlands did not have many trees to use as firewood or charcoal, one use the Dutch made of the available peat was to fire kilns to make pottery. During World War II, the Dutch Resistance came up with an unusual use for peat. Since peat was so available in the fields, resistance fighters sometimes stacked peat into human-sized piles and used the piles for target practice.

===Estonia===
After oil shale in Estonia, peat is the second-most-mined natural resource. The peat production sector has a yearly revenue of around €100 million and it is mostly export-oriented. Peat is extracted from around .

===India===
====Sikkim====
The mountains of the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau contain pockets of high-altitude wetlands. Khecheopalri is one of the Sikkim&#x27;s most famous and diverse peatlands in the eastern Indian territory of Sikkim, which includes 682 species representing five kingdoms, 196 families and 453 genera.

===United Kingdom===
====England====
England has around 1 million acres of peatland. Peatlands in England store 584m tonnes of carbon in total but emit around 11 million tonnes of every year due to degradation and draining. In 2021 only 124 people owned 60% of England&#x27;s peatland.

The extraction of peat from the Somerset Levels began during the Roman times and has been carried out since the Levels were first drained. On Dartmoor, there were several commercial distillation plants formed and run by the British Patent Naphtha Company in 1844. These produced naphtha on a commercial scale from the high-quality local peat.

Fenn&#x27;s, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses is an element of a post-Ice Age peat bog that straddles the England–Wales border and contains many rare plant and animal species due to the acidic environment created by the peat. Only lightly hand-dug, it is now a national nature reserve and is being restored to its natural condition.

The industrial extraction of peat occurred at the Thorne Moor site, outside Doncaster near the village of Hatfield. Government policy incentivised commercial removal to peat for agricultural use. This caused much destruction of the area during the 1980s. The removal of the peat resulted in later flooding further downstream at Goole due to the loss of water retaining peatlands. Recently regeneration of peatland has occurred as part of the Thorne Moors project, and at Fleet Moss, organised by Yorkshire Wildlife Trust.

====Northern Ireland====
In Northern Ireland, there is small-scale domestic turf cutting in rural areas, but areas of bogs have been diminished because of changes in agriculture. In response, afforestation has seen the establishment of tentative steps towards conservation such as Peatlands Park, County Armagh which is an Area of Special Scientific Interest.

====Scotland====

Some Scotch whisky distilleries, such as those on Islay, use peat fires to dry malted barley. The drying process takes about 30 hours. This gives the whiskies a distinctive smoky flavour, often called &quot;peatiness&quot;.
The peatiness, or degree of peat flavour, of a whisky is calculated in ppm of phenol. Normal Highland whiskies have a peat level of up to 30 ppm, and the whiskies on Islay usually have up to 50 ppm. In rare types like the Octomore, the whisky can have more than 100 ppm of phenol. Scotch Ales can also use peat-roasted malt, imparting a similar smoked flavor.

Because they are easily compressed under minimal weight, peat deposits pose significant difficulties for building structures, roads and railways. When the West Highland railway line was constructed across Rannoch Moor in western Scotland, its builders had to float the tracks on a multi-thousand-ton mattress of tree roots, brushwood, earth and ash.

==== Wales ====
Wales has over 70,000 hectares of peatlands. Most of it is blanket peat bog in the highlands, but there are a few hundred hectares of peatland in lowland areas. Some peatland areas in Wales are in poor condition. In 2020, the Welsh Government established a five-year peatland restoration initiative, which will be implemented by Natural Resources Wales (NRW).

===Canada===
There are 294 million acres of peatland in Canada, with approximately 43,500 acres in production and another 34,500 acres involved in past production. The current and past acreage in production amounts to 0.03 percent of Canada&#x27;s peatland.
Canada is the top exporter of peat by value. In 2021, top exporters of peat (including peat litter), whether or not agglomerated, were Canada ($580,591.39K, 1,643,950,000 kg), European Union ($445,304.42K, 2,362,280,000 kg), Latvia ($275,459.14K, 2,184,860,000 kg), Netherlands ($235,250.84K, 1,312,850,000 kg), Germany ($223,414.66K, 1,721,170,000 kg).

<text>The Dabru Emet (Heb. דברו אמת &quot;Speak [the] Truth&quot;) is a document concerning the relationship between Christianity and Judaism. It was signed by over 220 rabbis and intellectuals from all branches of Judaism, as individuals and not as representing any organisation or stream of Judaism.

In light of the Second Vatican Council in 1965, the Dabru Emet was first published on 10 September 2000, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and has since been used in Jewish education programs across the U.S. While affirming that there are theological differences between these two religions, the purpose of Dabru Emet is to point out common ground and a legitimacy of Christianity, for non-Jews, from the Jewish perspective. It is not an official document of any of the Jewish denominations per se, but it is representative of what many Jews feel. Eight major themes are expressed:

#Jews and Christians worship the same God
#Jews and Christians seek authority from the same book
#Christians can respect the claim of the Jews on the land of Israel
#Jews and Christians together accept the moral principles of the Torah (Pentateuch)
#Nazism is not a Christian phenomenon
#The controversy between Jews and Christians will not be settled until God redeems the entire world as promised in scripture and no-one should be pressed into believing another&#x27;s belief
#A new relationship between Jews and Christians will not weaken Jewish practice
#Jews and Christians must work together for justice and peace

== Jewish criticism ==
There are various objections to &quot;Dabru Emet&quot; from within the Jewish community. Some hold that it understates the significant theological differences between the two religions. Thus, most Conservative and Reform rabbis have not signed it, although many do agree with most of the document. Very few Orthodox rabbis have signed it; The Institute for Public Affairs, of the &quot;Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations&quot; (commonly known as the Orthodox Union) issued this response:

While agreeing with desire to encourage inter-faith dialogue and reconciliation, many Jews disagree with the section in Dabru Emet which holds that Christian theology is not in any way to blame for most of the last 2,000 years of anti-Semitism, or the Holocaust. Instead, it is believed by many Jews that much of Christian theology and teachings have been deeply anti-Semitic. Jews point to the 2,000 year history of antisemetism committed by Christians, and anti-Judaism inherent in Christian theological dogma. For instance, statements in the New Testament, such as , in which Jesus speaks divisive words to some particular Jews of his day:

==Orthodox Rabbis&#x27; Statement: &quot;Christianity Is Neither Accident Nor Error&quot;==

On 3 December 2015, 28 Orthodox Rabbis released a statement through the Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation (CJCUC) in Israel. Rabbis Irving Greenberg, David Rosen, and Shlomo Riskin are prominent among them in the interfaith movement. The unprecedented declaration, entitled &quot;To Do the Will of Our Father in Heaven: Toward a Partnership between Jews and Christians&quot;, praises “Nostra Aetate,” a Vatican document that repudiated Christian persecution against Jews. “Now that the Catholic Church has acknowledged the eternal Covenant between God and Israel, we Jews can acknowledge the ongoing constructive validity of Christianity as our partner in world redemption, without any fear that this will be exploited for missionary purposes,” it reads.

== Christian reaction ==
The European Lutheran Commission on the Church and the Jewish People (Lutherische Europäische Kommission Kirche und Judentum, LEKKJ), an umbrella organization representing twenty-five Lutheran church bodies in Europe, issued on May 12, 2003 &quot;A Response to Dabru Emet&quot;:

<text>Cley next the Sea (, ) is a village and civil parish on the River Glaven in the English county of Norfolk.

Cley next the Sea is located north-west of Holt and north-west of Norfolk.

==History==
The village&#x27;s name is of Anglo-Saxon origin and derives from the Old English for &#x27;clay&#x27;.

In the Domesday Book, Cley is recorded as a settlement of 38 households located in the hundred of Holt. In 1086, the village formed parts of the East Anglian estates of King William I.

A ruined building on the marshes is known as Blakeney Chapel; despite its name, it is in Cley parish, and probably never had a religious purpose. It is a Grade II listed building and scheduled monument which was likely an old iron smeltery.

Cley was once one of the busiest ports in England, where grain, malt, fish, spices, coal, cloth, barley and oats were exported or imported. The many Flemish gables in the town are a reminder of trade with the Low Countries. But despite its name, Cley has not been &quot;next the sea&quot; since the 17th century, due to land reclamation.

Some of the buildings that once lined the quay remain, notably the 18th-century Cley Windmill. The windmill, a five-storey tower mill, was owned by the family of singer James Blunt for many decades and operated as a bed and breakfast. The mill was sold in 2006, but continues to operate as a bed and breakfast on a non-profit making basis. It was used as a backdrop of the 1949 film &quot;Conspirator&quot; with Elizabeth Taylor. Cley Mill has often been depicted by local artists and was the subject of a painting by the 20th-century English landscape artist, Rowland Hilder.

After a devastating fire in 1612 destroyed 117 buildings, much of Cley was rebuilt in the prevailing architectural styles of the time.

Cley Hall is dated to 1770 and is a red-brick country house. The hall has been Grade II listed since 1952.

After the silting up of the port, Cley had to find another industry; in the late 19th century, it became a holiday resort. The poet Rupert Brooke was staying in Cley with classics professor Francis Macdonald Cornford and his wife, the poet Frances Cornford, early in August 1914 when news came that Britain had entered what was to become the First World War. Brooke had dreamt about the war and woke to find it a reality. He did not speak to his hosts all day until Frances Cornford said, &quot;But Rupert, you won&#x27;t have to fight?&quot; to which Brooke replied, &quot;We shall all have to fight&quot;.

During the Second World War, significant defences (including mortar pits, slit trenches and bunkers) were built in Cley to defend against a possible German invasion. There was also a prisoner-of-war camp in Cley during the conflict.

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census, Cley next the Sea has a population of 401 people which shows a decrease from the 437 people recorded in the 2011 census.

The A149, between King&#x27;s Lynn and Great Yarmouth, runs through the centre of the village, causing congestion in the summer months due to the tight, narrow streets.

==St Margaret&#x27;s Church==

Cley next the Sea&#x27;s parish church is dedicated to Saint Margaret of Antioch and is located on Cley Green. St Margaret&#x27;s dates from the 14th century and has been Grade I listed since 1960.

St Margaret&#x27;s was built at the expense of the mercantile de Vaux family and was built by the mason, William de Ramsey, though the construction was halted during the Black Death. The church boasts several carved roundels, an elaborate Medieval font as well as a damaged set of royal arms from the reign of Queen Anne.

==Cley Marshes==

The marshes around Cley are internationally important for their populations of rare breeding and visiting birds. Cley Marshes bird reserve has been in the care of the Norfolk Wildlife Trust since 1926, making it the oldest county Wildlife Trust reserve in Britain. Among resident breeding birds are avocet, bearded tit, bittern, marsh harrier and spoonbill. Winter visitors include brent goose, Eurasian wigeon, pintail and many species of wading birds. Cley, like neighbouring Salthouse is ideally situated at the apex of the North Norfolk coast as a staging ground for passage migrants, vagrants and rarities of all kinds. A new eco-friendly visitor centre opened in 2007 containing a café, shop, viewing areas (including viewing from a camera on the reserve), exhibition area, interpretation and toilets. The view from the visitor centre across the marsh to the sea is breathtaking. Cley Marshes is the home of the Bird Information Service, publishers of &quot;Birding World&quot;.
The shingle bank holds large numbers of yellow horned poppy.

==Sea defences==
The salt and fresh water marshes used to be very well protected. However the cost of replenishing the shingle spit grew too much for the village to sustain. Once the repairing stopped, it became easier for waves to get through; in 1953 a large storm, measured at above ordnance datum (see North Sea flood of 1953) hit the North Norfolk coast and the shingle ridge was mostly destroyed. A further storm surge in 1978 measured above ordnance datum and the protection measures confined flooding to the marshes and A149 coast road. The North Norfolk Shoreline Management Plan introduced by the Environment Agency has proposed a number of strategies in the light of continual erosion and predicted rising sea levels caused by global warming: these include &quot;Advance the line&quot;, &quot;Hold the line&quot;, &quot;Managed retreat&quot; and &quot;Do nothing&quot;. Even after extensive public consultation there is widespread local concern that the marshes will be lost to the North Sea.

==Notable residents and appearance in media==

* William Jones was a merchant here in the 18th century. His daughter, Charlotte Jones, became a noted Royal miniature portrait painter.
* Singer and songwriter James Blunt spent time, in his early years, at his grandfather&#x27;s and later his father&#x27;s windmill in the village.
* Cley Old Hall was used as a location in the 1982 film &quot;The Ploughman&#x27;s Lunch&quot;. During July 1997 the BBC filmed one of its BBC One balloon idents, which ran from 1997 to 2002, in the village.

== Governance ==
Cley next the Sea is part of the electoral ward of Coastal for local elections and is part of the district of North Norfolk.

The village&#x27;s national constituency is North Norfolk, which has been represented by the Liberal Democrat Steff Aquarone MP since 2024.

<text>The Napoléon is the colloquial term for a former French gold coin. The coins were minted (at various times) in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 40, 50, and 100 francs. This article focuses on the 20 franc coins issued during the reign of Napoléon Bonaparte, which are 21 mm in diameter, weigh 6.45 grams (gross weight) and, at 90% pure, contain of pure gold. The coin was issued during the reign of Napoleon I and features his portrait on the obverse. The denomination (known as the Franc Germinal) continued in use through the 19th century and later French gold coins in the same denomination were generally referred to as &quot;Napoléons&quot;. Earlier French gold coins are referred to as &quot;Louis&quot; (the name of eighteen French kings) or &quot;écu&quot; (an old French word for shield). Gold Napoléons have historically proven more resilient than other gold coins to economic forces, such as after the Suez crisis when unlike other coins Napoléons did not weaken.

== Overview ==

The coins were originally minted in two denominations, 20 and 40 francs for Napoléon Bonaparte. The 40-franc gold piece did not become popular. The 20 franc coins are 21 mm in diameter (about the size of a U.S. five-cent piece or a Swiss 20 Rappen coin), weigh 6.45 grams (gross weight) and; at 90% pure, contain of pure gold. The 40 franc coins are 26 mm in diameter, weigh 12.90 grams (gross weight) and; are 90% pure gold.

They were issued during the reign of Napoleon I and feature his portrait, sometimes bare headed and other times wearing a laurel wreath (the ancient Roman symbol of imperial or military glory) and, depending upon the political status of France, the words on the front: either &quot;Bonaparte – Premier Consul&quot; (First Consul) or &quot;Napoléon Empereur&quot; (emperor). On the back: the legends read either &quot;RÉPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE&quot; (French Republic) or after 1809, &quot;EMPIRE FRANÇAIS&quot; (French Empire). There was even a 20 and 40 Lire Napoleon minted under the auspices of the Kingdom of Italy, a client state. &quot;Bonaparte First Consul&quot; pieces of similar size, weight and fineness were struck at the Turin Mint. The obverse (&quot;L&#x27;Italie Délivrée à Marengo]&quot;) recounts that Italy was liberated from Austria by Bonaparte at Marengo, Piedmont on 14 June 1800, whereat the French General Louis Desaix was killed. The reverse indicates the extent liberated lands, known as Gaul Subalpine, Eridania or Northern Italy. The type was created pursuant to the decree of the Gaul Subalpine government established after the Battle of Marengo and which existed from 16 June 1800, through 11 September 1802.

==Dates of usage of the &quot;Napoléon&quot; coins==
The coin continued in use through the 19th century and later French gold coins in the same denomination were generally referred to as &quot;Napoleons&quot;. In particular the coins of Napoleon I were minted not only at the several French mints but also at the mints in Italian territories: Genoa, Turin (1803 to 1813), Rome (1812 to 1813), the Netherlands: Utrecht (1812 to 1813), and Swiss territories: Geneva, during the French occupation of these places. Although the mints came under French administration and minted French Empire coins, it was otherwise business as usual as the incumbent mint masters remained in their posts, for example: Sarwaas in Utrecht, Paroletti in Turin and Mazzio in Rome.

==French coins minted in London==
Some coins of King Louis XVIII were minted in London in 1815. The English were supportive of the return of the French king to power after he was deposed by Napoleon in 1815, during the famous Hundred Days. The coins minted at London were purportedly authorized by Louis XVIII himself and were used to pay British troops occupying parts of North Western France. Some coins found their way to Paris and were considered counterfeits by the monetary authorities there and then. There was an exchange of diplomatic letters between France and England and the activity was stopped. The English artist who engraved the London dies, Thomas Wyon, Jr. (1792–1817), a highly accomplished artist, was insulted when his dies which were low relief based on the French struck coins and the original engravings of London born French engraver Pierre Joseph Tiolier (1763–1819) were considered inferior. Allegations also arose that the London Mint did not respect French law regarding fineness and tolerance with these coins and these facts have been offered for the early withdrawal of the coins from circulation. However, contemporaneous assays demonstrated adherence to the French law by the London minters. No coins were struck after 30 November 1815.

==First authorized by the Monetary Ordinance of 28 March 1803==
Napoleon tried to unify Europe and almost succeeded, especially in terms of the coinage. The Napoleon coin was first authorized by a Monetary Ordinance of 28 March 1803 by the Premier Consul (First Consul) Napoleon Bonaparte. The 20 franc gold pieces which he authorized in 1803, became the model of all the coins of the Latin Monetary Union which circulated in Europe until 1914. The French coin carries the effigy, in profile, Napoleon, who would later become the French Emperor. The coins had the same value as the Louis, which bears the likeness of the pre-French Revolution King Louis XIV. For Napoleon, there were ostensibly seven types or varieties of the coins minted. In general the varieties differed in terms of obverse legend, reverse legends, portraiture, and calendaring system. For each variety, there was a new enabling statute or executive decree: 28 March 1803; 7 April 1803; 26 June 1804; 8 September 1805; 11 February 1807; 5 August 1807; and 22 October 1808. By extension, the term &quot;Napoleon&quot; is applied today to all the various types of 20 franc French gold pieces.

===&quot;The Euro before the Euro&quot;===
Although the portraits and legends changed with the political changes in France, the denomination remained in usage until World War I under what was known as the Latin Monetary Union, the &quot;Euro before the Euro&quot;, so-to-speak. Switzerland had 20 Swiss franc pieces, Spain had 20 peseta coins, Italy had 20 lira pieces, Belgium had 20 Belgian franc coins, and Greece had 20 drachma coins, all of which circulated and were accepted throughout Europe. Only for political reasons did the United Kingdom and the German Empire refuse to follow this direction. Attempts were even taken to explore the unification of the European currency with the American dollar, which explains the extremely rare U.S. pattern coins carrying $4 marking on the face and 25 franc markings on the reverse.


==Distinguishing marks of the mint masters==
The coins bear the signature of the master engraver responsible for the engraving of the coins&#x27; dies. In later times the engraver used a symbol to identify himself. The coins also bear the mark (a symbol, letter, or monogram) denoting the particular French (or French controlled) mint which struck the coin. These mint marks often signal the rarity of the issue, for example the Napoleon 20 franc gold coin struck in 1809 at Paris and marked with the letter &quot;A&quot; had an issue of 687,508 coins; in the same year at the mint at Bordeaux, marked with the letter &quot;K&quot; only 2,534 coins were struck; while the mint at Lille, marked with a &quot;W&quot; struck 16,911 coins. Over the years there were some twenty-three French mints not only in France but also in annexed or occupied countries, including Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands.

==The engravers==
Jean Pierre Droz (1746–1823), was perhaps the most skillful and certainly the most famous engraver and medallist of his day. Born in La-Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Droz studied in Paris and won acclaim with his fine pattern piece known as the Écu de Calonne after the French finance minister. This coin was struck with an edge inscription using a six-segmented collar (virole brisée) of Droz&#x27; own invention at the Paris Mint. After a brief tenure at Matthew Boulton&#x27;s Birmingham (Soho) Mint, Droz returned to France and in 1799 was appointed Keeper of the Coins and Medals at the Paris Mint, which post he held throughout the Napoleonic era. Meanwhile, he was much in demand by other governments as a consultant. He struck patterns for Spain, the United States and his native Neuchâtel among others. In French coinage, the effigy of Napoleon as engraved by him appears both on the 20 and 40 franc gold pieces from 1804 through 1814. Droz was also responsible for the pattern of the 5 francs of the &quot;Hundred Days&quot; in 1815. Among his medallic work, the coronation medals for Napoleon in 1804 (&quot;Medal Celebrating the Coronation of Napoleon I by Pope Pius VII at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris&quot;) and several medals and jetons for the Bank of France are the most noteworthy.

Pierre-Joseph Tiolier (1763–1819), born in London, was appointed the engraver-general of the Paris Mint from 1803 to 1816. Tiolier engraved the patterns for the Bonaparte-First Consul coins. Tiolier was trained by his brother-in-law, the notable, Benjamin Duvivier. Many improvements of the coining machinery took place during Tiolier&#x27;s tenure at the mint. His many medals and coins attest to his high skill. Tiolier&#x27;s full signature appears on the dies he cut while coins bearing a &quot;Tr&quot; were from dies cut by others.

Thomas Wyon, Jr. (1792–1817) was an English medallist who died at the early age of 25. In both 1810 and again in 1811, he won the Society of Arts gold medal for medal engraving. In only four years, from 1811 to 1815, he rose at the Royal Mint from a probationer to chief engraver.

==Notes on varieties of Napoleon coins==
After a competition among artists who submitted designs: Nicholas Guy Antoine Brenet (1773-1846), André Galle (1761-1844), Romain-Vincent Jeuffroy (1749-1826), the design by the Swiss, Jean-Pierre Droz (1746-1823) was selected. The coins were the work of Joseph Pierre Tiolier (1763-1819), who was appointed Chief Engraver of the Paris Mint on 1 April 1803. There were no reducing machines at the time and the entirety of the engraver&#x27;s work was completed by directly cutting into the die face with punches and gravers.

In Year XI the government invested in a different method of minting pioneered by Jean-Pierre-Joseph Darcet (1777-1844). And in 1807, new minting equipment was introduced under the supervision of Philippe Joachim Gengembre (1764-1838), Inspector General of the Mints. This equipment, a &quot;Balancier Manuel&quot; (screw press) included a full ring (closed collar), produced slightly reduced reliefs. The general appearance of the coins is thus slightly modified compared to the coins struck by the prior methods.

In accordance with the Concordat with Pope Pius VII (1742-1823), signed 15 July 1801, a decree put an end to the revolutionary calendar. On 17 Brumaire Year 14 (8 November 1805) the Minister of Finance announced the return to the Gregorian calendar, which had been outlawed in October 1793, with effect from 1 January 1806.

Slight modifications in the portrait make it possible to distinguish the 1807 type from the preceding 1806 type; in particular, the variation is in the space between the rim and the top of the head. The 1807 issues are remarkable because the design was decided during Napoleon&#x27;s absence. When he returned to Paris he was surprised to discover the new coins which were the result of the engraver&#x27;s diligence. This is also considered a transitional issue, that is a coin struck after an official series ends, or before an official series starts. It can also refer to a coin struck with either the obverse or the reverse of a discontinued or upcoming series. These coins are a transitional issue because they were minted just before the 1807/08 issues (with laurel crown). The term &quot;tête de nègre&quot; sometimes used for these coins is a colloquial descriptor applied because of the frizzy appearance of Napoleon&#x27;s hair as that of an African man.

A decree was announced by the Ministry of Finance on 5 August 1807, specifying the addition of a laurel wreath to the bust of Napoleon symbolizing the military victories of the Emperor. The decree of 22 October 1808, specified that for coins issued after 1 January 1809, the legend ―French Republic‖ would be replaced by ―French Empire.

1813CL- Tiolier was responsible for the dies for the Napoleonic coinage of Genoa (15 November 1811 through 1814).

1813Flag- the coining of French coins at Utrecht began on 16 November 1812 and did not continue beyond 1813.
1815 – the beading for the 1815 issue consists of 100 beads rather than the 103 beads used from 1809 to 1814. The 1815 coins show a greater distance between the eyebrows and the points of the &quot;N&quot; in Napoleon which are 2.4 mm for 1815 compared to 1.5 mm for earlier strikes. It is unlikely that at the time of the Emperor&#x27;s return, Tiolier&#x27;s original 20 francs dies had been preserved and thus, the dies must have been re-cut for the Hundred Days (21 March 1815 through 14 July 1815). The 1815 issue constitutes a discrete variety and the dies, signed Tr, were cut by Droz.

1815R (London) was struck in a lower relief, therefore, examples are difficult to find in better quality, yielding what is known as &quot;condition rarities&quot;. On the obverse, the portrait is unsigned by the engraver, Wyon. On the edge, the word &quot;SALVUM&quot; appears to begin with the letter &quot;Z&quot; and the word &quot;FAC&quot; is not separated by a dot from the word &quot;REGEM.&quot; On the reverse, the date is flanked by a fleur de lye, which was not a mark of any mint director, and the letter &quot;R&quot; which was not assigned to any French mint. The issue was considered counterfeit at the time of issue; however, it was authorized by Louis XVIII, in exile, and used for the payment of British troops serving in France.

Between 1802 and 1814 millions of coins were struck and they circulated heavily. The average daily wage in 1805 was 1.50₣ (US 27¢).

The coins carry mottos on the edges. Irregularities of the rims are acceptable and are not considered defects as they were caused by shifts of the coining collar and are characteristic of the edge lettering process. The edge letters are not sharp. There may be adjustment marks on the rims as well. The die axis was not well fixed and oscillates between 5 and 7 o&#x27;clock (as illustrated in the above photo of the An IX coin).

==&quot;Coins, a reflection of the political events of 1814–1815&quot;==
In 1814 when Louis XVIII was restored to the throne of France (the Restoration), France changed its flag. Its coins, however, were merely modified to carry the king&#x27;s portrait. There was a possibility that in modifying the coinage, Louis XVIII could have broken the reforms of the Revolution and returned to the duodecimal system and the &quot;livres&quot; of the Old Regime. But the new coins were struck with the same weight and fineness envisaged by Napoleon in the law of the 7 Germinal year XI, with one effigy (Louis XVIII) replacing another (Napoleon I).

<text>Saqqara ( : saqqāra[t], ), also spelled Sakkara or Saccara in English , is an Egyptian village in the markaz (county) of Badrashin in the Giza Governorate, that contains ancient burial grounds of Egyptian royalty, serving as the necropolis for the ancient Egyptian capital, Memphis. Saqqara contains numerous pyramids, including the Pyramid of Djoser, sometimes referred to as the Step Pyramid, and a number of mastaba tombs. Located some south of modern-day Cairo, Saqqara covers an area of around .

Saqqara contains the oldest complete stone building complex known in history, the Pyramid of Djoser, built during the Third Dynasty. Another sixteen Egyptian kings built pyramids at Saqqara, which are now in various states of preservation. High officials added private funeral monuments to this necropolis during the entire Pharaonic period. It remained an important complex for non-royal burials and cult ceremonies for more than 3000 years, well into Ptolemaic and Roman times.

North of the Saqqara site lies the Abusir pyramid complex, and to its south lies the Dahshur pyramid complex, which together with the Giza Pyramid complex to the far north comprise the Pyramid Fields of Memphis, or the Memphite Necropolis, which was designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979.

Some scholars believe that the name Saqqara is not derived from the ancient Egyptian funerary deity, Sokar, but from a local Berber tribe called the Beni Saqqar, despite the fact that a tribe of this name is not documented anywhere. Medieval authors also refer to the village as Ard as-Sadr ().

==History==
===Early Dynastic===


 of nobles can be traced back to the First Dynasty, at the northern side of the Saqqara plateau. During this time, the royal burial ground was at Abydos. The first royal burials at Saqqara, comprising underground galleries, date to the early Second Dynasty reigns of Hotepsekhemwy, Raneb and Nynetjer. This is followed by a hiatus, with Seth-Peribsen and Khasekhemwy, the last Second Dynasty king, both buried in Abydos. Khasekhemwy may nonetheless also have built a funerary monument at Saqqara consisting of a large rectangular enclosure, known as Gisr el-Mudir, although this enclosure could also belong to Nynetjer. It probably inspired the monumental enclosure wall around the Step Pyramid complex. Djoser&#x27;s funerary complex, built by the royal architect Imhotep, further comprises a large number of dummy buildings and a secondary mastaba (the so-called &#x27;Southern Tomb&#x27;). French architect and Egyptologist Jean-Philippe Lauer spent the greater part of his life excavating and restoring Djoser&#x27;s funerary complex.

* Tomb of king Nynetjer
* Buried Pyramid, funerary complex of king Sekhemkhet
* Gisr el-Mudir, funerary complex of a Second Dynasty king, possibly Nynetjer or Khasekhemwy
* Step Pyramid, funerary complex of king Djoser
===Old Kingdom===
Nearly all Fourth Dynasty kings chose a different location for their pyramids. During the second half of the Old Kingdom, under the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties, Saqqara was again the royal burial ground. The Fifth and Sixth Dynasty pyramids are not built wholly of massive stone blocks, but instead with a core consisting of rubble. Consequently, they are less well preserved than the world-famous pyramids built by the Fourth Dynasty kings at Giza. Unas, the last ruler of the Fifth Dynasty, was the first king to adorn the chambers in his pyramid with Pyramid Texts. During the Old Kingdom, it was customary for courtiers to be buried in mastaba tombs close to the pyramid of their king. Thus, clusters of private tombs were formed in Saqqara around the pyramid complexes of Unas and Teti.

===Middle Kingdom===
From the Middle Kingdom onward, Memphis was no longer the capital of the country, and kings built their funerary complexes elsewhere. Few private monuments from this period have been found at Saqqara.

====Second Intermediate Period monuments====
*Pyramid of king Khendjer (Dynasty Thirteen)
*Pyramid of an unknown king

===New Kingdom===

During the New Kingdom, Memphis was an important administrative and military centre, being the capital after the Amarna Period. From the Eighteenth Dynasty onward, many high officials built tombs at Saqqara. While still a general, Horemheb built a large tomb here, although he later was buried as pharaoh in the Valley of the Kings at Thebes. Other important tombs belong to the vizier Aperel, the vizier Neferronpet, the artist Thutmose, and the wet-nurse of Tutankhamun, Maia.

Many monuments from earlier periods were still standing, but dilapidated by this period. Prince Khaemweset, son of Pharaoh Ramesses II, made repairs to buildings at Saqqara. Among other things, he restored the Pyramid of Unas and added an inscription to its south face to commemorate the restoration. He enlarged the Serapeum, the burial site of the mummified Apis bulls, and was later buried in the catacombs. The Serapeum, containing one undisturbed interment of an Apis bull and the tomb of Khaemweset, were rediscovered by the French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette in 1851.

====New Kingdom monuments====
*Several clusters of tombs of high officials, among which the tombs of Horemheb and of Maya and Merit. Reliefs and statues from these two tombs are on display in the National Museum of Antiquities at Leiden, the Netherlands, and in the British Museum, London.

===After the New Kingdom===
During the periods after the New Kingdom, when several cities in the Delta served as capital of Egypt, Saqqara remained in use as a burial ground for nobles. Moreover, the area became an important destination for pilgrims to a number of cult centres. Activities sprang up around the Serapeum, and extensive underground galleries were cut into the rock as burial sites for large numbers of mummified ibises, baboons, cats, dogs, and falcons.

====Monuments of the Late Period, the Graeco-Roman and later periods====
*Several shaft tombs of officials of the Late Period
*Serapeum (the larger part dating to the Ptolemaic Period)
*The so-called &#x27;Philosophers circle&#x27;, a monument to important Greek thinkers and poets, consisting of statues of Hesiod, Homer, Pindar, Plato, and others (Ptolemaic)
*Several Coptic monasteries, among which the Monastery of Apa Jeremiah (Byzantine and Early Islamic Periods)

==Site looting during 2011 protests==
Saqqara and the surrounding areas of Abusir and Dahshur suffered damage by looters during the 2011 Egyptian protests. Store rooms were broken into, but the monuments were mostly unharmed.

==Recent Discoveries==

===2010s===
During routine excavations in 2011 at the dog catacomb in Saqqara necropolis, an excavation team led by Salima Ikram and an international team of researchers led by Paul Nicholson of Cardiff University uncovered almost eight million animal mummies at the burial site next to the sacred temple of Anubis. It is thought that the mummified animals, mostly dogs, were intended to pass on the prayers of their owners to their deities.

In July 2018, German-Egyptian researchers’ team head by Ramadan Badry Hussein of the University of Tübingen reported the discovery of an extremely rare gilded burial mask that probably dates from the Saite-Persian period in a partly damaged wooden coffin. The last time a similar mask was found was in 1939. The eyes were covered with obsidian, calcite, and black hued gemstone possibly onyx. &quot;The finding of this mask could be called a sensation. Very few masks of precious metal have been preserved to the present day, because the tombs of most Ancient Egyptian dignitaries were looted in ancient times.&quot; said Hussein.

In September 2018, several dozen cache of mummies dating 2,000 years back were found by a team of Polish archaeologists led by Kamil Kuraszkiewicz from the Faculty of Oriental Studies of the University of Warsaw. The Polish-Egyptian expedition works under the auspices of the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw. Investigations were carried out for over two decades in the area to the west of the Djoser Pyramid. The most important discoveries include the tomb of vizier Merefnebef with a funerary chapel decorated with multi-colored reliefs, which was uncovered in 1997. as well as the tomb of courtier Nyankhnefertem uncovered in 2003. The expedition also explored two necropoles. Archaeologists revealed several dozen graves of noblemen from the period of the 6th Dynasty, dating to the 24th–21st century BC, and 500 graves of indigent people dating approximately to the 6th century BC – 1st century AD. Most of the bodies were poorly preserved and all organic materials, including the wooden caskets, had decayed. The tombs discovered most recently (in 2018) form part of the younger, so-called Upper Necropolis.

The research of the Polish-Egyptian expedition also focuses on the interpretation of the so-called Dry Moat, a vast trench hewn around the Djoser Pyramid. The most recent discoveries confirm the hypothesis that the Dry Moat was a model of the pharaoh&#x27;s journey to the netherworld, a road the deceased ruler had to follow to attain eternal life.

In November 2018, an Egyptian archaeological mission located seven ancient Egyptian tombs at the ancient necropolis of Saqqara. Three of the tombs were used for cats, some dating back to the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties, while one of four other sarcophagi was unsealed. Among the dozens of cat mummies were 100 wooden and gilded statues of cats and one in bronze dedicated to the cat goddess Bastet, and funerary items dating back to the 12th Dynasty. Another of the seven tombs belongs to Khufu-Imhat, the overseer of buildings in the royal palace.

Also in November 2018, a collection of rare mummified scarab beetles was unearthed in two sarcophagi, one of which was decorated with paintings of large black beetles.

Also in November 2018, the Egyptian government announced the discovery at Saqqara of a previously unknown 4,400-year-old tomb. It belongs to Wahtye, a high-ranking priest who served under King Neferirkare Kakai during the Fifth Dynasty, and his wife, four children and mother. The tomb is about long by wide and has five burial shafts and a basement. It contains more than fifty sculptures, and is painted with scenes of the family, wine and pottery making, musical performances, sailing, hunting, and furniture making.

On 13 April 2019, an expedition led by a member of the Czech Institute of Egyptology, Mohamed Megahed, discovered a 4,000-year-old tomb near Egypt&#x27;s Saqqara Necropolis. Archaeologists confirmed that the tomb belonged to an influential person named Khuwy, who lived in Egypt during the 5th Dynasty. &quot;The L-shaped Khuwy tomb starts with a small corridor heading downwards into an antechamber and from there a larger chamber with painted reliefs depicting the tomb owner seated at an offerings table&quot;, reported Megahed. Some paintings maintained their brightness over a long time in the tomb. Mainly made of white limestone bricks, the tomb had a tunnel entrance generally typical for pyramids. Archaeologists say that there might be a connection between Khuwy and pharaoh because the mausoleum was found near the pyramid of Egyptian Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi, who ruled during that time.

In October 2019, a cache of 30 coffins with mummies was discovered, at the time Egypt&#x27;s largest in more than a century and the first cache to be discovered by a solely Egyptian mission. The coffins were stacked on top of each other and arranged in two rows about three feet below the sandy surface. The first coffin&#x27;s head was partially exposed in the sand, which led to the cache&#x27;s discovery. Two of the coffins belonged to children, a rare occurrence in archeology. Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, explained that one could identify the mummy&#x27;s gender by the shape of the hands on the coffin, open hands being female and hands balled into fists being male. The colors of the coffin inscriptions---made from limestone, red oak, turquoise, and other natural stones mixed with eggwhites—stayed intact, and the mixture of egg yolk and candle wax spread over the coffins to make them shine was still visible, making this a unique find.

===2020s===

On April 28, 2020, archeologists announced they had found a 30-foot-deep (9 meter) burial shaft containing five limestone sarcophagi, four wooden coffins with human mummies, and an array of other artifacts. Among them were 365 faience ushabti and a small wooden obelisk about 40 centimeters tall that had been painted with depictions of Horus, Isis and Nepthys.

In September 2020, a deep burial shaft revealed almost 30 sarcophagi that had remained completely sealed since their interment.

On 3 October 2020, Khalid el-Anany, Egypt&#x27;s tourism and antiquities minister announced the discovery of at least 59 sealed sarcophagi with mummies more than 2,600 years old. Archaeologists also revealed the 20 statues of Ptah-Soker and a carved 35-centimeter tall bronze statue of god Nefertem.

On 19 October 2020, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced the discovery of gilded, wooden statues and more than 80 coffins in three burial shafts. Officials believed the coffins contain senior officials and priests from the 26th Dynasty.

In November 2020, archaeologists unearthed more than 100 delicately painted wooden coffins dating to the 26th Dynasty and 40 statues of the local goddess Ptah Soker. Other artifacts discovered include funeral masks, canopic jars and 1,000 ceramic amulets. “This discovery is very important because it proves that Saqqara was the main burial of the 26th Dynasty,” said Zahi Hawass, an Egyptologist and Egypt&#x27;s former Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs.

In January 2021, the tourism and antiquities ministry announced the discovery of more than 50 wooden sarcophagi in 52 burial shafts which date back to the New Kingdom period, each around 30 to 40 feet deep, and a 13 ft-long papyrus that contains texts from Chapter 17 of the &quot;Book of the Dead.&quot; The papyrus scroll belonged to a man named Bu-Khaa-Af, whose name is written on it, on his sarcophagus, and on four ushabtis. Excerpts from the Book of the Dead were also painted onto the surface of other coffins. Also found in the shafts were wooden funerary masks, board games, a shrine dedicated to god of the dead Anubis, bird-shaped artifacts and a bronze axe. A limestone stelae dated to the reign of Ramesses II was found in one of the shafts, depicting the overseer of the king&#x27;s military chariot Kha-Ptah and his wife Mwt-em-wia worshipping Osiris and sitting with six of their children.

Also in January 2021, a team of archaeologists led by Zahi Hawass found the funerary temple of Naert or Narat and three warehouses made of bricks attached to the southeastern side for storage of temple provisions, offerings and tools. Researchers also revealed that Narat&#x27;s name was engraved on a fallen obelisk near the main entrance. Previously unknown to researchers, Naert was a wife of Teti, the first king of the sixth dynasty.

In November 2021, archeologists from Cairo University discovered several tombs, including that of Batah-M-Woya, chief treasurer during the reign of Ramesses II, and of a military leader named Hor Mohib.

In March 2022, five 4000-year-old tombs belonging to senior officials from the Old Kingdom and First Intermediary Period were discovered. On 30 May 2022, 250 sarcophagi and 150 statuettes were displayed at Saqqara, dated back to the Late Period more than 2,500 years ago, in addition to a 9-meter-long papyrus scroll which could be a depiction of a chapter of the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;.

In May 2022, the discovery of the nearly 4,300-year-old tomb of an ancient Egyptian high-ranked person who handled royal, sealed documents of pharaoh was announced. According to University of Warsaw’s Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, the elaborately decorated tomb belonged to a man named Mehtjetju who served as a priest and an inspector of the royal property. Kamil O. Kuraszkiewicz, expedition director stated that Mehtjetju most likely lived at about the same time, at some point during the reigns of the first three rulers of the Sixth Dynasty: Teti, Userkare and Pepy I.

In January 2023, Zahi Hawass announced the discovery of four tombs at Saqqara including a 4,300-year-old mummy to a man named Hekashepes covered with gold, in addition to finds date back to the 5th and 6th dynasties, such as a priest inspector named Khnumdjedef, secret keeper called Meri and a judge and writer named Fetek.

In April 2024, a rock-cut tomb dating back to the Second Dynasty was uncovered in Saqqara by a team of Japanese and Egyptian archaeologists. The tomb contained artifacts from various periods, spanning over the Late Period, the Ptolemaic period, and the 18th Dynasty. Among the findings were remains of an adult with a colored mask and a small child, in addition to two terracotta statues depicting Isis and Harpocrates.

<text>Cleitarchus or Clitarchus () was one of the historians of Alexander the Great. Son of the historian Dinon of Colophon, he spent a considerable time at the court of Ptolemy Lagus. He was active in the mid to late 4th century BCE.

Quintilian (&quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot;. x. I. 74) credits him with more ability than trustworthiness, and Cicero (&quot;Brutus&quot;, II) accuses him of giving a fictitious account of the death of Themistocles. But there is no doubt that his history was very popular, and much used by Diodorus Siculus, Quintus Curtius, Justin and Plutarch, and the authors of the Alexander romances. His unnatural and exaggerated style became proverbial.

His work, the &quot;History of Alexander&quot;, is almost completely lost and has survived only in some thirty fragments preserved by ancient authors, especially by Aelian and Strabo.

A recent papyrological find from Oxyrhynchus (P.Oxy. LXXI 4808) records that he was a tutor () of Ptolemy IV Philopator, r.221–205 BCE, and suggests that he wrote in the mid to late 3rd century, not, as was hitherto thought, in the late 4th. Luisa Prandi (2012) has recently restated the case for the &quot;high&quot; dating.

<doc id="99421" wikidata="Q1360410" url="?curid=99421" title="Coppicing">
<text>Coppicing is the traditional method in woodland management of cutting down a tree to a stump, which in many species encourages new shoots to grow from the stump or roots, thus ultimately regrowing the tree. A forest or grove that has been subject to coppicing is called a copse or coppice, in which young tree stems are repeatedly cut down to near ground level. The resulting living stumps are called stools. New growth emerges, and after a number of years, the coppiced trees are harvested, and the cycle begins anew. Pollarding is a similar process carried out at a higher level on the tree in order to prevent grazing animals from eating new shoots. &quot;Daisugi&quot; (台杉, where &quot;sugi&quot; refers to Japanese cedar), is a similar Japanese technique.

Many silviculture practices involve cutting and regrowth; coppicing has been of significance in many parts of lowland temperate Europe. The widespread and long-term practice of coppicing as a landscape-scale industry is something that remains of special importance in southern England. Many of the English language terms referenced in this article are particularly relevant to historic and contemporary practice in that area.

Typically a coppiced woodland is harvested in sections or &quot;coups&quot; (also spelled &#x27;coupe&#x27; but pronounced &#x27;coop&#x27; and descended from the French or Norman French &#x27;couper&#x27;, to cut or coupé &#x27;has been cut&#x27;) on a rotation. English terms for an area of coppice include &#x27;cant&#x27;, &#x27;panel&#x27; and &#x27;fall&#x27; which can be interchangeable and regionally-based. In this way, a crop is available each year somewhere in the woodland. Coppicing has the effect of providing a rich variety of habitats, as the woodland always has a range of different-aged coppice growing in it, which is beneficial for biodiversity. The cycle length depends upon the species cut, the local custom, and the use of the product. Birch can be coppiced for faggots on a three- or four-year cycle, whereas oak can be coppiced over a fifty-year cycle for poles or firewood.

Trees being coppiced do not die of old age as coppicing maintains the tree at a juvenile stage, allowing them to reach immense ages. The age of a stool may be estimated from its diameter; some are so largeas much as acrossthat they are thought to have been continually coppiced for centuries.

== History ==
Evidence suggests that coppicing has been continuously practised since pre-history. Coppiced stems are characteristically curved at the base. This curve occurs as the competing stems grow out from the stool in the early stages of the cycle, then up toward the sky as the canopy closes. The curve may allow the identification of coppice timber in archaeological sites. Timber in the Sweet Track in Somerset (built in the winter of 3807 and 3806 BCE) has been identified as coppiced &quot;Tilia&quot; species.

Originally, the silvicultural system now called coppicing was practiced solely for small wood production. In German this is called &quot;Niederwald&quot;, which translates as low forest. Later on in Mediaeval times, farmers encouraged pigs to feed from acorns, and so some trees were allowed to grow bigger. This different silvicultural system is called in English &quot;coppice with standards&quot;. In German this is called &quot;Mittelwald&quot; (middle forest). As modern forestry (&quot;Hochwald&quot; in German, which translates as High forest) seeks to harvest timber mechanically, and pigs are generally no longer fed from acorns, both systems have declined. However, there are cultural and wildlife benefits from these two silvicultural systems, so both can be found where timber production or some other main forestry purpose (such as a protection forest against an avalanche) is not the sole management objective of the woodland.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the technology of charcoal iron production became widely established in England, continuing in some areas until the late 19th century. Charcoal once fuelled all metalworking (with evidence dating back many thousands of years) and other high temperature industrial processes (see white coal) but scarcity led to the eventual adoption of coal as the primary fuel. Decline in charcoal as an industrial fuel accelerated after the discovery of coke (coal heated in limited oxygen) in the 18th century and leading to a crash in UK charcoal production in the century thereafter. Notably, scarcity of charcoal for industrial processes actually led to the survival of large areas of woodland in the weald of Kent and the Sussexes as large areas of coppiced woodland were jealously guarded by Roman ironmasters and later by Medieval ironmasters. Charcoal hearths in woodlands are indications of ancient status (in context).

Along with the need for oak bark for tanning, charcoal required large amounts of coppiced wood. With this coppice management, wood could be provided for those growing industries in principle indefinitely. This was regulated by a statute of 1544 of Henry VIII, which required woods to be enclosed after cutting (to prevent browsing by animals) and 12 standels (&quot;standards&quot; or mature uncut trees) to be left in each acre, to be grown into timber. Coppice with standards (scattered individual stems allowed to grow on through several coppice cycles) has been commonly used throughout most of Europe as a means of giving greater flexibility in the resulting forest product from any one area. The woodland provides the small material from the coppice as well as a range of larger timber for such uses as house building, bridge repair, cart-making and so on. But note that coppice produce was used in parallel with larger timber. For example, hazel and willow as woven wattle infill panels (daubed or plastered) in housebuilding and ash coppice to produce components for carts, and several species for components for bridge rails and fences.

In the 18th century coppicing in Britain began a long decline. This was brought about by the erosion of its traditional markets. Firewood was no longer needed for domestic or industrial uses as coal and coke became easily obtained and transported, and wood as a construction material was gradually replaced by newer materials. Coppicing died out first in the north of Britain and steadily contracted toward the south-east until by the 1960s active commercial coppice was heavily concentrated in Kent and Sussex.

== Practice ==
The shoots (or &quot;suckers&quot;) may be used either in their young state for interweaving in wattle fencing (as is the practice with coppiced willows and hazel), or the new shoots may be allowed to grow into large poles, as was often the custom with trees such as oaks or ashes and sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa). This creates long, straight poles which do not have the bends and forks of naturally grown trees. Coppicing may be practised to encourage specific growth patterns, as with cinnamon trees which are grown for their bark.

(Note that the use of the term &#x27;suckers&#x27; above is incompatible with an accurate understanding of how coppice works. Coppice stems grow from epicormic buds developed from groups of cells called bud precursors in the cambium under the bark on cut stem bases. Epicormic buds develop and grow when the upper parts of the stem (which normally produce inhibitory plant hormone analogues) are removed. Suckers refers to shoots growing from roots in response to felling to ground as seen in wild cherry or gean (Prunus avium) and aspen (Populus tremula) but also has been adopted in horticulture to refer to a competing shoot sprouting from a rootstock below the interface with the scion. Such shoots (if not removed) can grow more vigorously then the grafted material which can fail and die).

Another, more complicated system is called &quot;compound coppice&quot;. Here some of the standards would be left, some harvested. Some of the coppice would be allowed to grow into new standards and some regenerated coppice would be there. Thus there would be three age classes. Coppiced hardwoods were used extensively in carriage and shipbuilding, and they are still sometimes grown for making wooden buildings and furniture. 

Compound coppice is a term used for when two or more different species are grown in the same cant and cut on different cycles. Example: Hazel-ash coppice with hazel cut at 7 years and ash in the same area cut at 21 years (every third cut, all stools in the cant are cut). But note that under coppice with standards (for instance oak standards over hazel) the oak was cut under a much longer cycle. With hazel-ash under oak standards you now have 3 cycles superimposed. However, a range of ages of standards was managed-for to allow for continuity of oak production for timber (shipbuilding especially) and this was sometimes legislated for. It is commonly written that there should be 12 standards per acre. BUT this &#x27;12 per acre&#x27; includes (as an average over the whole wood) maybe 1 mature oak per acre, a couple of young standards and several waivers with a larger number of seedlings/saplings whose genesis was sporadic and occurred when oak mast years coincided with coppice cuts - planting being relatively rare until perhaps the 16th century. Coppice can be complicated, which is likely why large areas of one species (hazel, sweet chestnut) with no standards is called &#x27;simple coppice&#x27;.

Waivers: (also &#x27;wavers&#x27;) Young oak trees (older than seedlings or saplings) that may become standards in due turn. Or may be cut before becoming standards. If you can get both hands around it at breast height but can&#x27;t get 4 Sussex fence rails out of the first 10’, it&#x27;s a waiver.

Withies for wicker-work are grown in coppices of various willow species, principally osier.

In France, sweet chestnut trees are coppiced for use as canes and &quot;bâtons&quot; for the martial art Canne de combat (also known as &quot;Bâton français&quot;).

Some &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species are coppiced in a number of countries, including Australia, North America, Uganda, and Sudan.&lt;ref name=&#x27;dpi.vic.gov.au/Trees&amp;NativeVege-FarmFor-ManagCoppiceEuc&#x27;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;

The Sal tree is coppiced in India, and the &quot;Moringa oleifera&quot; tree is coppiced in many countries, including India.

Sometimes former coppice is converted to high-forest woodland by the practice of singling. All but one of the regrowing stems are cut, leaving the remaining one to grow as if it were a maiden (uncut) tree.

The boundaries of coppice coups were sometimes marked by cutting certain trees as pollards or stubs.

=== United Kingdom ===

In southern Britain, coppice was traditionally hazel, hornbeam, field maple, ash, sweet chestnut, occasionally sallow, elm, small-leafed lime and rarely oak or beech, grown among pedunculate or sessile oak, ash or beech standards. In wet areas alder and willows were used. A small, and growing, number of people make a living wholly or partly by working coppices in the area today, at places such as at the Weald and Downland Living Museum.

Coppices provided wood for many purposes, especially charcoal before coal was economically significant in metal smelting. A minority of these woods are still operated for coppice today, often by conservation organisations, producing material for hurdle-making, thatching spars, local charcoal-burning or other crafts. The only remaining large-scale commercial coppice crop in England is sweet chestnut which is grown in parts of Sussex and Kent. Much of this was established as plantations in the 19th century for hop-pole production (hop-poles are used to support the hop plant while growing hops) and is nowadays cut on a 12 to 18-year cycle for splitting and binding into cleft chestnut paling fence, or on a 20- to 35-year cycle for cleft post-and-rail fencing, or for sawing into small lengths to be finger-jointed for architectural use. Other material goes to make farm fencing and to be chipped for modern wood-fired heating systems.

In northwest England, coppice-with-standards has been the norm, the standards often of oak with relatively little simple coppice. After World War II, a great deal was planted up with conifers or became neglected. Coppice-working almost died out, though a few men continued in the woods.

== Wildlife ==
Coppice management favours a range of wildlife, often of species adapted to open woodland. After cutting, the increased light allows existing woodland-floor vegetation such as bluebell, anemone and primrose to grow vigorously. Often brambles grow around the stools, encouraging insects, or various small mammals that can use the brambles as protection from larger predators. Woodpiles (if left in the coppice) encourage insects such as beetles to come into an area. The open area is then colonised by many animals such as nightingale, European nightjar and fritillary butterflies. As the coup grows, the canopy closes and it becomes unsuitable for these animals againbut in an actively managed coppice there is always another recently cut coup nearby, and the populations therefore move around, following the coppice management.

However, most British coppices have not been managed in this way for many decades. The coppice stems have grown tall (the coppice is said to be &quot;overstood&quot;), forming a heavily shaded woodland of many closely spaced stems with little ground vegetation. The open-woodland animals survive in small numbers along woodland rides or not at all, and many of these once-common species have become rare. Overstood coppice is a habitat of relatively low biodiversityit does not support the open-woodland species, but neither does it support many of the characteristic species of high forest, because it lacks many high-forest features such as substantial dead-wood, clearings and stems of varied ages. Suitable conservation management of these abandoned coppices may be to restart coppice management, or in some cases it may be more appropriate to use singling and selective clearance to establish a high-forest structure.

== Natural occurrence ==
Coppice and pollard growth is a response of the tree to damage, and can occur naturally. Trees may be browsed or broken by large herbivorous animals, such as cattle or elephants, felled by beavers or blown over by the wind. Some trees, such as linden, may produce a line of coppice shoots from a fallen trunk, and sometimes these develop into a line of mature trees. For some trees, such as the common beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;), coppicing is more or less easy depending on the altitude: it is much more efficient for trees in the montane zone.

== For energy wood ==
Coppicing of willow, alder and poplar for energy wood has proven commercially successful. The Willow Biomass Project in the United States is an example of this. In this case the coppicing is done in a way that an annual or more likely a tri-annual cut can happen. This seems to maximize the production volume from the stand. Such frequent growth means the soils can be easily depleted and so fertilizers are often required. The stock also becomes exhausted after some years and so will be replaced with new plants. The method of harvesting of energy wood can be mechanized by adaptation of specialized agricultural machinery.

Species and cultivars vary in when they should be cut, regeneration times and other factors. However, full life cycle analysis has shown that poplars have a lower effect in greenhouse gas emissions for energy production than alternatives.

<text>Ricky Meléndez (born Ricardo Omar Meléndez Saurí, November 22, 1967 in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico) is a Puerto Rican singer, lawyer and actor, best known for his tenures as a member of boy band Menudo and of El Reencuentro.

==Career==
He was raised in Guaynabo. He became a member of Menudo at the age of nine. He was one of the original five in the group joined by his brothers Carlos and Oscar, and brothers Fernando and Nefty Salaberry. He is also the cousin of group founder Edgardo Díaz. As a member of Menudo, he acted in two films: &quot;&quot; and &quot;Una Aventura Llamada Menudo&quot;. He was a member of the band through most of the band&#x27;s golden era and he&#x27;s remembered for singing lead in the tracks &quot;Y Yo No Bailo&quot;, &quot;Amor en Bicicleta&quot; and &quot;Cámbiale Las Pilas&quot;.

Meléndez retired from Menudo in 1984 at the mandatory age of 16, but since he had started at age nine, he became the band member with the longest tenure at eight years. He gave up his place to Ricky Martin. His final concert with Menudo was in Caguas, where he was joined by most of the former Menudo members on that concert&#x27;s date, September 16, 1984.

Once Meléndez left Menudo, he tried various business ventures, including a shop at Plaza Las Americas in San Juan, and became a lawyer. In 1998, he got together with former bandmates Rene Farrait, Johnny Lozada, Ray Reyes, Charlie Masso and Miguel Cancel to make a comeback tour under the name of El Reencuentro. They toured the world.

==Personal life==
Melendez attended the University High School in San Juanl. Meléndez graduated in 1995 with a juris doctor from the University of Puerto Rico Law School and practices corporate and real estate law at Pietrantoni Mendez &amp; Alvarez LLC. Meléndez also has a B.A. from University of Central Florida in broadcasting.

Melendez is married to Miriam &quot;Muñeca&quot; Calderín. He has one son and one daughter.

== In pop culture ==
Melendez is played by Marcelo Otano and by Eugenio Rivera in the 2020 Amazon Prime Video series based on Menudo, &quot;Subete A Mi Moto&quot;.

<text>Diodorus Siculus or Diodorus of Sicily (;  1st century BC) was an ancient Greek historian from Sicily. He is known for writing the monumental universal history &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot;, in forty books, fifteen of which survive intact, between 60 and 30 BC. 
The history is arranged in three parts. The first covers mythic history up to the destruction of Troy, arranged geographically, describing regions around the world from Egypt, India and Arabia to Europe. The second covers the time from the Trojan War to the death of Alexander the Great. The third covers the period to about 60 BC. &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, meaning &#x27;library&#x27;, acknowledges that he was drawing on the work of many other authors.

==Life==
According to his own work, he was born in Agyrium in Sicily (now called Agira). With one exception, antiquity affords no further information about his life and doings beyond his written works. Only Jerome, in his &quot;Chronicon&quot; under the &quot;year of Abraham 1968&quot; (49 BC), writes, &quot;Diodorus of Sicily, a writer of Greek history, became illustrious&quot;. However, his English translator, Charles Henry Oldfather, remarks on the &quot;striking coincidence&quot; that one of only two known Greek inscriptions from Agyrium (&quot;Inscriptiones Graecae&quot; XIV, 588) is the tombstone of one &quot;Diodorus, the son of Apollonius&quot; (“&quot;Διόδωρος ∙ Ἀπολλωνίου&quot;”) . The final work attributed to him is from 21 BC.

==Work==

Diodorus&#x27; universal history, which he named &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot; (, &quot;Historical Library&quot;), was immense and consisted of 40 books, of which 1–5 and 11–20 survive: fragments of the lost books are preserved in Photius and the &quot;Excerpts&quot; of Constantine Porphyrogenitus.

It was divided into three sections. The first six books treated the mythic history of the non-Hellenic and Hellenic tribes to the destruction of Troy and are geographical in theme, and describe the history and culture of Ancient Egypt (book I), of Mesopotamia, India, Scythia, and Arabia (II), of North Africa (III), and of Greece and Europe (IV–VI).

In the next section (books VII–XVII), he recounts the history of the world from the Trojan War down to the death of Alexander the Great. The last section (books XVII to the end) concerns the historical events from the successors of Alexander down to either 60 BC or the beginning of Julius Caesar&#x27;s Gallic Wars. (The end has been lost, so it is unclear whether Diodorus reached the beginning of the Gallic War as he promised at the beginning of his work or, as evidence suggests, old and tired from his labours, he stopped short at 60 BC.) He selected the name &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; in acknowledgment that he was assembling a composite work from many sources. Identified authors on whose works he drew include Hecataeus of Abdera, Ctesias of Cnidus, Ephorus, Theopompus, Hieronymus of Cardia, Duris of Samos, Diyllus, Philistus, Timaeus, Polybius, and Posidonius.
