<text>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive neurotherapy, a form of brain stimulation in which a changing magnetic field is used to induce an electric current at a specific area of the brain through electromagnetic induction. An electric pulse generator, or stimulator, is connected to a magnetic coil connected to the scalp. The stimulator generates a changing electric current within the coil which creates a varying magnetic field, inducing a current within a region in the brain itself.
TMS has shown diagnostic and therapeutic potential in the central nervous system with a wide variety of disease states in neurology and mental health, but has not demonstrated clinical worth for treatment of any other condition.
Adverse effects of TMS appear rare and include fainting and seizure.
== Medical uses ==

TMS does not require surgery or electrode implantation.

Its use can be diagnostic and/or therapeutic. Effects vary based on frequency and intensity of the magnetic pulses as well as the length of treatment, which dictates the total number of pulses given. TMS treatments are approved by the FDA in the US and by NICE in the UK for the treatment of depression and are provided by private clinics and some VA medical centers. TMS stimulates cortical tissue without the pain sensations produced in transcranial electrical stimulation.

=== Diagnosis ===
TMS can be used clinically to measure activity and function of specific brain circuits in humans, most commonly with single or paired magnetic pulses. The most widely accepted use is in measuring the connection between the primary motor cortex of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system to evaluate damage related to past or progressive neurologic insult. TMS has utility as a diagnostic instrument for myelopathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis.

=== Treatment ===
There is some evidence that TMS may have applications for a number of conditions including depression, fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain, and TMS treatment is covered by most private insurance plans as well as by traditional Medicare, but for no condition does the evidence rise to the level of showing clinical relevance.

== Adverse effects ==
TMS is generally advertised as a safe alternative to medications such as SSRI&#x27;s. The greatest immediate risk from TMS is fainting, though this is uncommon. Seizures have been reported, but are rare.

Risks are higher for therapeutic repetitive TMS (rTMS) than for single or paired diagnostic TMS. Adverse effects generally increase with higher frequency stimulation.

==Procedure==
During the procedure, a magnetic coil is positioned at the head of the person receiving the treatment using anatomical landmarks on the skull, in particular the inion and nasion. The coil is then connected to a pulse generator, or stimulator, that delivers electric current to the coil.

== Physics ==

TMS uses electromagnetic induction to generate an electric current across the scalp and skull. A plastic-enclosed coil of wire is held next to the skull and when activated, produces a varying magnetic field oriented orthogonally to the plane of the coil. The changing magnetic field then induces an electric current in the brain that activates nearby nerve cells in a manner similar to a current applied superficially at the cortical surface.

The magnetic field is about the same strength as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the pulse generally reaches no more than 5 centimeters into the brain unless using a modified coil and technique for deeper stimulation.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation is achieved by quickly discharging current from a large capacitor into a coil to produce pulsed magnetic fields between 2 and 3 teslas in strength. Directing the magnetic field pulse at a targeted area in the brain causes a localized electrical current which can then either depolarize or hyperpolarize neurons at that site. 
The induced electric field inside the brain tissue causes a change in transmembrane potentials resulting in depolarization or hyperpolarization of neurons, causing them to be more or less excitable, respectively.

TMS usually stimulates to a depth from 2 to 4 cm below the surface, depending on the coil and intensity used. Consequently, only superficial brain areas can be affected. Deep TMS can reach up to 6 cm into the brain to stimulate deeper layers of the motor cortex, such as that which controls leg motion. The path of this current can be difficult to model because the brain is irregularly shaped with variable internal density and water content, leading to a nonuniform magnetic field strength and conduction throughout its tissues.

===Frequency and duration===
The effects of TMS can be divided based on frequency, duration and intensity (amplitude) of stimulation:
* Single or paired pulse TMS causes neurons in the neocortex under the site of stimulation to depolarize and discharge an action potential. If used in the primary motor cortex, it produces muscle activity referred to as a motor evoked potential (MEP) which can be recorded on electromyography. If used on the occipital cortex, &#x27;phosphenes&#x27; (flashes of light) might be perceived by the subject. In most other areas of the cortex, there is no conscious effect, but behaviour may be altered (e.g., slower reaction time on a cognitive task), or changes in brain activity may be detected using diagnostic equipment.
* Repetitive TMS (rTMS) produces longer-lasting effects which persist past the period of stimulation. rTMS can increase or decrease the excitability of the corticospinal tract depending on the intensity of stimulation, coil orientation, and frequency. Low frequency rTMS with a stimulus frequency less than 1 Hz is believed to inhibit cortical firing, while a stimulus frequency greater than 1 Hz, referred to as high frequency, is believed to provoke it. Though its mechanism is not clear, it has been suggested as being due to a change in synaptic efficacy related to long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression like plasticity (LTD-like plasticity).

=== Coil types ===
Most devices use a coil shaped like a figure-eight to deliver a shallow magnetic field that affects more superficial neurons in the brain. Differences in magnetic coil design are considered when comparing results, with important elements including the type of material, geometry and specific characteristics of the associated magnetic pulse.

The core material may be either a magnetically inert substrate (&#x27;air core&#x27;), or a solid, ferromagnetically active material (&#x27;solid core&#x27;). Solid cores result in more efficient transfer of electrical energy to a magnetic field and reduce energy loss to heat, and so can be operated with the higher volume of therapy protocols without interruption due to overheating. Varying the geometric shape of the coil itself can cause variations in focality, shape, and depth of penetration. Differences in coil material and its power supply also affect magnetic pulse width and duration.

A number of different types of coils exist, each of which produce different magnetic fields. The round coil is the original used in TMS. Later, the figure-eight (butterfly) coil was developed to provide a more focal pattern of activation in the brain, and the four-leaf coil for focal stimulation of peripheral nerves. The double-cone coil conforms more to the shape of the head. The Hesed (H-core), circular crown and double cone coils allow more widespread activation and a deeper magnetic penetration. They are supposed to impact deeper areas in the motor cortex and cerebellum controlling the legs and pelvic floor, for example, though the increased depth comes at the cost of a less focused magnetic pulse.

== Research directions ==
For Parkinson&#x27;s disease, early results suggest that low frequency stimulation may have an effect on medication associated dyskinesia, and that high frequency stimulation improves motor function.

== History ==
Luigi Galvani (1737–1798) undertook research on the effects of electricity on the body in the late-eighteenth century and laid the foundations for the field of electrophysiology. In the 1830s Michael Faraday (1791–1867) discovered that an electrical current had a corresponding magnetic field, and that changing one could induce its counterpart.

Work to directly stimulate the human brain with electricity started in the late 1800s, and by the 1930s the Italian physicians Cerletti and Bini had developed electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT became widely used to treat mental illness, and ultimately overused, as it began to be seen as a panacea. This led to a backlash in the 1970s.

In 1980 Merton and Morton successfully used transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) to stimulate the motor cortex. However, this process was very uncomfortable, and subsequently Anthony T. Barker began to search for an alternative to TES. He began exploring the use of magnetic fields to alter electrical signaling within the brain, and the first stable TMS devices were developed in 1985. They were originally intended as diagnostic and research devices, with evaluation of their therapeutic potential being a later development. The United States&#x27; FDA first approved TMS devices in October 2008.

==Regulatory status ==

===Speech mapping prior to neurosurgery===
Nexstim obtained United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act§Section 510(k) clearance for the assessment of the primary motor cortex for pre-procedural planning in December 2009 and for neurosurgical planning in June 2011.

===Depression===
TMS is approved as a Class II medical device under the &quot;&quot;de novo&quot; pathway&quot;.

=== Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) ===
In August 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) authorized the use of TMS developed by the Israeli company Brainsway in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD).

In 2020, US FDA authorized the use of TMS developed by the U.S. company MagVenture Inc. in the treatment of OCD.

In 2023, US FDA authorized the use of TMS developed by the U.S. company Neuronetics Inc. in the treatment of OCD.

===Other neurological areas===
In the European Economic Area, various versions of deep TMS H-coils have CE marking for
Alzheimer&#x27;s disease,
autism,
bipolar disorder,
epilepsy,
chronic pain,
major depressive disorder,
Parkinson&#x27;s disease,
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
schizophrenia (negative symptoms)
and to aid smoking cessation.
One review found tentative benefit for cognitive enhancement in healthy people.

===Coverage by health services and insurers===

==== United Kingdom ====
The United Kingdom&#x27;s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issues guidance to the National Health Service (NHS) in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland (UK). NICE guidance does not cover whether or not the NHS should fund a procedure. Local NHS bodies (primary care trusts and hospital trusts) make decisions about funding after considering the clinical effectiveness of the procedure and whether the procedure represents value for money for the NHS.

NICE evaluated TMS for severe depression in 2007, finding that TMS was safe, but with insufficient evidence for its efficacy. Guidance was updated and replaced in 2015, concluding that evidence for short‑term efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for depression was adequate, although the clinical response is variable, and ruling that rTMS for depression may be used with arrangements for clinical governance and audit.

In January 2014, NICE reported the results of an evaluation of TMS for treating and preventing migraine (IPG 477). NICE found that short-term TMS is safe but there is insufficient evidence to evaluate safety for long-term and frequent uses. It found that evidence on the efficacy of TMS for the treatment of migraine is limited in quantity, that evidence for the prevention of migraine is limited in both quality and quantity.

 use of rTMS in the UK was reported to have remained limited due to the cost of equipment and establishing treatment centres. Camilla Nord, head of the Mental Health Neuroscience Lab at the University of Cambridge said &quot;The NHS has unfortunately been far behind the US and Canada on rTMS, which is at least as effective as antidepressants, if not more&quot;.

==== United States ====

;Commercial health insurance
In 2013, several commercial health insurance plans in the United States, including Anthem, Health Net, Kaiser Permanente, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska and of Rhode Island, covered TMS for the treatment of depression for the first time. In contrast, UnitedHealthcare issued a medical policy for TMS in 2013 that stated there is insufficient evidence that the procedure is beneficial for health outcomes in patients with depression. UnitedHealthcare noted that methodological concerns raised about the scientific evidence studying TMS for depression include small sample size, lack of a validated sham comparison in randomized controlled studies, and variable uses of outcome measures. Other commercial insurance plans whose 2013 medical coverage policies stated that the role of TMS in the treatment of depression and other disorders had not been clearly established or remained investigational included Aetna, Cigna and Regence.

;Medicare
Policies for Medicare coverage vary among local jurisdictions within the Medicare system, and Medicare coverage for TMS has varied among jurisdictions and with time. For example:
* In early 2012 in New England, Medicare covered TMS for the first time in the United States. However, that jurisdiction later decided to end coverage after October, 2013.
* In August 2012, the jurisdiction covering Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico determined that there was insufficient evidence to cover the treatment, but the same jurisdiction subsequently determined that Medicare would cover TMS for the treatment of depression after December 2013.

== Limitations ==

There are serious concerns about stimulating brain tissue using non-invasive magnetic field methods such as uncertainty in the dose and localisation of the stimulation effect.

<text>Konstanz ( , , , ), traditionally known as Constance in English, is a university city with approximately 83,000 inhabitants located at the western end of Lake Constance in the south of Germany. The city houses the University of Konstanz and was the residence of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Konstanz for more than 1,200 years.

==Location==
The city is located in the state of Baden-Württemberg and situated at the banks of Lake Constance (&quot;Bodensee&quot; in German). The river Rhine, which starts in the Swiss Alps, passes through Lake Constance and leaves it, considerably larger, by flowing under a bridge connecting the two parts of the city. North of the river lies the larger part of the city with residential areas, industrial estates, and the University of Konstanz; while south of the river is the old town, which houses the administrative centre and shopping facilities in addition to the &quot;Hochschule&quot; or the &quot;University of Applied Sciences&quot;. Car ferries provide access across Lake Constance to Meersburg, and the &quot;Katamaran&quot; provides a shuttle service for pedestrians to Friedrichshafen. The Germany–Switzerland border runs along the southwestern and southern edge of the city, demarcating it from the Swiss town of Kreuzlingen.

==Subdivisions==

Konstanz is subdivided into 15 wards or districts (&quot;Stadtteile&quot;). The island of Mainau belonged to the ward of Litzelstetten, a separate municipality, until its incorporation into Konstanz on 1 December 1971.
==History==


The first traces of civilization in Konstanz date back to the late Stone Age. 
During the reign of Augustus, the Celts living south of the Danube were conquered by the Romans. Around 40 AD, the first Romans settled on the site. This small town on the left bank of the Rhine was probably first called &quot;Drusomagus&quot; and belonged to the Roman province of &quot;Raetia&quot;. Its later name, originally &quot;Constantia&quot;, comes either from the Roman emperor Constantius Chlorus, who fought the Alemanni in the region and built a strong fortress around 300 AD, or from his grandson Constantius II, who visited the region in 354. The remains of the late Roman fortress &quot;Constantia&quot; were discovered in 2003.

Around 585 the first bishop took up residence in Konstanz and this marked the beginning of the city&#x27;s importance as a spiritual center. By the late Middle Ages, about one quarter of Konstanz&#x27;s 6,000 inhabitants were exempt from taxation on account of clerical rights.

Trade thrived during the Middle Ages. Konstanz owned the only bridge in the region, which crossed the Rhine, making it a strategic location in the Duchy of Swabia. Its linen production had made an international name for the city and it was prosperous. In 1192, Konstanz gained the status of Imperial City so it was henceforth subject only to the Holy Roman Emperor.

In 1414 to 1418, the Council of Constance took place, during which, on 6 July 1415, Jan Hus (Czech religious thinker, philosopher and reformer), who was seen as a threat to Christianity by the Roman Catholic Church, was burned at the stake. It was here that the Papal Schism was ended and Pope Martin V was elected during the only conclave ever held north of the Alps. Ulrich von Richental&#x27;s illustrated chronicle of the Council of Constance testifies to all the major happenings during the council as well as showing the everyday life of medieval Konstanz. The &quot;Konzilgebäude&quot; where the conclave was held can still be seen standing by the harbour. Close by stands the &quot;Imperia&quot;, a statue that was erected in 1993 to satirically commemorate the council.

In 1460, the Swiss Confederacy conquered Thurgau, Konstanz&#x27;s natural hinterland. Konstanz then made an attempt to get admitted to the Swiss Confederacy, but the forest cantons voted against its entry, fearing overbearing city states; Konstanz then joined the Swabian League instead. In the Swabian War of 1499, Konstanz lost its last privileges over Thurgau to the Confederation.

The Protestant Reformation took hold in Konstanz in the 1520s, headed by Ambrosius Blarer. Soon the city declared itself officially Protestant, pictures were removed from the churches, and the bishop temporarily moved to Meersburg, a small town across the lake. The city first followed the Tetrapolitan Confession, and then the Augsburg Confession. However, in 1548 Emperor Charles V imposed the Imperial Ban on Konstanz and it had to surrender to Habsburg Austria which had suddenly attacked. Thus Konstanz lost its status as an imperial city.
The new Habsburg rulers were eager to re-Catholicise the town and in 1604 a Jesuit College was opened. Its accompanying theatre, built in 1610, is the oldest theatre in Germany still performing regularly.

The city became part of the Grand Duchy of Baden in 1806. In 1821, the Bishopric of Constance was dissolved and became part of the Archdiocese of Freiburg. Konstanz became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the unification of Germany. After World War I it was included within the Republic of Baden.
On 22 October 1940, 110 of the last Jewish residents were deported to Gurs internment camp in France. Most of those who were still alive in August 1942 were murdered in either Sobibór or Auschwitz.

Because it almost lies within Switzerland, directly adjacent to the Swiss border, Konstanz was not bombed by the Allied Forces during World War II. After the war, Konstanz was included first in South Baden and then in the new state of Baden-Württemberg.

The &quot;Altstadt&quot; (Old Town), which is large considering the small size of modern Konstanz, has many old buildings and twisting alleys. The city skyline is dominated by Konstanz Cathedral, several other churches and three towers left over from the city wall, one of which marks the place of the former medieval bridge over the Rhine.

The University of Konstanz was established close to the town in 1966. It houses a library with approximately two million books, all freely accessible 24 hours a day, as well as a botanical garden (the Botanischer Garten der Universität Konstanz). Especially since 2007, the university, being one of the nine German universities most successful in the German Universities Excellence Initiative, has gained considerable reputation as a so-called &quot;elite university&quot;.

Konstanz was the birthplace of Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, constructor of the famous Zeppelin airships.
In the late 2010s, Konstanz has become a popular destination for &quot;Einkaufstourismus&quot;, or cross-border shopping by Swiss due to lower prices on basic items in Germany, a favorable exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the euro, and a generous German VAT refund for non-European Union residents. Retail chains such as H&amp;M and dm have built large new stores near the town&#x27;s central square to cater to this trade, and some Konstanz residents feel the city is losing its historic character in the process; many of them avoid the area on Saturdays. This has led to friction with officials from Kreuzlingen as their city has seen no economic benefit from this trade, and they have been requesting that their national government bring up the issue of the VAT refund with Germany. Subsequently, Germany has introduced a minimum spend amount of €50.01 per receipt for the German VAT to be refunded. Customs clearance centres are conveniently located near shopping centres.

==Climate==
Its location in south-west Germany gives Konstanz a degraded oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) with warm and humid summers (moderated by the lake) as well as cold and snowy winters.

<text>Hieratic (; ) is the name given to a cursive writing system used for Ancient Egyptian and the principal script used to write that language from its development in the third millennium BCE until the rise of Demotic in the mid-first millennium BCE. It was primarily written in ink with a reed brush on papyrus.

==Etymology==
In the second century, the term &quot;hieratic&quot; was used for the first time by the Greek scholar Clement of Alexandria to describe this Ancient Egyptian writing system. The term derives from the Greek for &#x27;priestly writing&#x27; () because at that time, for more than eight and a half centuries, hieratic had been used traditionally only for religious texts and literature.

&quot;Hieratic&quot; can also be an adjective meaning &#x27;of or associated with sacred persons or offices; &#x27;.

==Development==
Hieratic developed as a cursive form of hieroglyphic script in the Naqada III period of Ancient Egypt, roughly 3200–3000 BCE. Although handwritten printed hieroglyphs continued to be used in some formal situations, such as manuscripts of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, noncursive hieroglyphic script became largely restricted to monumental inscriptions.

Around 650 BCE, the more cursive Demotic script developed from hieratic. Demotic arose in northern Egypt and replaced hieratic and the southern shorthand known as abnormal hieratic for most mundane writing, such as personal letters and mercantile documents. Hieratic continued to be used by the priestly class for religious texts and literature into the third century AD.

==Uses and materials==

Through most of its long history, hieratic was used for writing administrative documents, accounts, legal texts, and letters, as well as mathematical, medical, literary, and religious texts. During the Greco-Roman period, when Demotic, and later, Greek, had become the chief administrative script, hieratic was limited primarily to religious texts. In general, hieratic was much more important than hieroglyphs throughout Egypt&#x27;s history, being the script used in daily life. It was also the writing system first taught to students, knowledge of hieroglyphs being limited to a small minority who were given additional training. It is often possible to detect errors in hieroglyphic texts that came about due to a misunderstanding of an original hieratic text.

Most often, hieratic script was written in ink with a reed brush on papyrus, wood, stone, or pottery ostraca. During the Roman period, reed pens (&quot;calami&quot;) were also used. Thousands of limestone ostraca have been found at the site of Deir al-Madinah, revealing an intimate picture of the lives of common Egyptian workers. Besides papyrus, stone, ceramic shards, and wood, there are hieratic texts on leather rolls, although few have survived. There are also hieratic texts written on cloth, especially on linen used in mummification. There are some hieratic texts inscribed on stone, a variety known as lapidary hieratic. These are particularly common on stelae from the twenty-second dynasty.

During the late sixth dynasty, hieratic was sometimes incised into mud tablets with a stylus, similar to cuneiform. About five hundred of these tablets have been discovered in the governor&#x27;s palace at Ayn Asil (Balat), and a single example was discovered from the site of Ayn al-Gazzarin, both in the Dakhla Oasis. At the time the tablets were made, Dakhla was located far from centers of papyrus production. These tablets record inventories, name lists, accounts, and approximately fifty letters. Of the letters, many are internal letters that were circulated within the palace and the local settlement, but others were sent from other villages in the oasis to the governor.

==Characteristics==

Hieratic script, unlike inscriptional and manuscript hieroglyphs, reads from right to left. Initially, hieratic could be written in either columns or horizontal lines, but after the twelfth dynasty (specifically during the reign of Amenemhat III), horizontal writing became the standard.

Hieratic is noted for its cursive nature and use of ligatures for a number of characters. Hieratic script also uses a much more standardized orthography than hieroglyphs; texts written in the latter often had to take into account extra-textual concerns, such as decorative uses and religious concerns that were not present in, say, a tax receipt. There are also some signs that are unique to hieratic, although Egyptologists have invented equivalent hieroglyphic forms for hieroglyphic transcriptions and typesetting. Several hieratic characters have diacritical additions so that similar signs could easily be distinguished.

Hieratic is often present in any given period in two forms, a highly ligatured, cursive script used for administrative documents, and a broad uncial bookhand used for literary, scientific, and religious texts. These two forms can often be significantly different from one another. Letters, in particular, used very cursive forms for quick writing, often with large numbers of abbreviations for formulaic phrases, similar to shorthand.

A highly cursive form of hieratic known as &quot;Abnormal Hieratic&quot; was used in the Theban area from the second half of the twentieth dynasty until the beginning of the twenty-sixth dynasty. It derives from the script of Upper Egyptian administrative documents and was used primarily for legal texts, land leases, letters, and other texts. This type of writing was superseded by Demotic—a Lower Egyptian scribal tradition—during the twenty-sixth dynasty, when Demotic was established as a standard administrative script throughout a re-unified Egypt.

==Influence==
Hieratic has had influence on a number of other writing systems. The most obvious is that on Demotic, its direct descendant. Related to this are the Demotic signs of the Meroitic script and the borrowed Demotic characters used in the Coptic alphabet and Old Nubian.

Outside of the Nile Valley, many of the signs used in the Byblos syllabary apparently were borrowed from Old Kingdom hieratic signs. It is also known that early Hebrew used hieratic numerals.

==Unicode==
The Unicode standard considers hieratic characters to be font variants of the Egyptian hieroglyphs, and the two scripts have been unified. Hieroglyphs were added to the Unicode Standard in October 2009 with the release of version 5.2.

<text>Friedrichshafen ( ; Low Alemannic: &quot;Hafe&quot; or &quot;Fridrichshafe&quot;) is a city on the northern shoreline of Lake Constance (the &quot;Bodensee&quot;) in Southern Germany, near the borders of both Switzerland and Austria. It is the district capital (&quot;Kreisstadt&quot;) of the Bodensee district in the federal state of Baden-Württemberg. Friedrichshafen has a population of about 63,000.

==History==

===19th and early 20th century===
Friedrichshafen was established in 1811 as part of the new Kingdom of Württemberg, an ally of France during the Napoleonic Wars. It was named for King Frederick I of Württemberg, who privileged it as a free port and transshipment point for the kingdom&#x27;s Swiss trade. Friedrichshafen was created from the former city of Buchhorn, whose coat of arms it adopted. The new city also incorporated the former village of Hofen, whose monastery was refurbished to serve as the summer residence of the Württemberger kings.

King William I continued improving the city, including the purchase of the steamship &quot;Wilhelm&quot;. Ministers and senior officials built villas around the royal castle, and many foreign tourists visited the city as well, including Tsar Alexander II of Russia. The first track laid by the Royal Württemberg State Railways connected the port to Ravensburg in 1847. Heilbronn was connected in 1850, and a ferry to Romanshorn in Switzerland began operating in 1869. Despite their previous opposition to Prussia, under the federal structure of the German Empire, Württemberg and Friedrichshafen continued to enjoy some special privileges following their incorporation into Germany following the Franco-Prussian War.

Ferdinand von Zeppelin established his famous dirigible factory at the end of the 19th century. The 128m-long LZ1 airship rose from its mooring on July 2, 1900. Other aviation companies, including Maybach, also arose in Friedrichshafen to help service the industry, which received a major impetus from World War I. Following the Treaty of Versailles, the Kingdom of Württemberg was dissolved but the deposed royal family continued in their possession of their castle in Friedrichshafen, despite a workers&#x27; revolution there in November, 1918.

===World War II===
Friedrichshafen served the Nazi regime as a resort for workers. The presence of Zeppelin, Maybach, Dornier, and Zahnradfabrik made it an important German industrial center during World War II. Between 1942 and 1945, the factories used slave labor of hundreds of concentration camp prisoners from Dachau and Dora-Mittelbau. They were housed first at Zeppelin&#x27;s hangar and then, following its destruction during a raid, the V-2 factory Raderach. The prisoners were also used to dig tunnels near Friedrichshafen to protect production sites from the repeated bombing.

Between June 1943 and February 1945, the city was targeted for Allied bombing attacks. The most accurate took place on April 28, 1944, and destroyed most of the old town center. Approximately two-thirds of the city was destroyed over the course of the war.

===Modern Germany===
Following World War II, Friedrichshafen was part of the French occupation zone before its incorporation into Baden-Württemberg, West Germany. In the aftermath of the war, Maybach and many other aviation companies turned to automobile construction, while Claudius Dornier purchased Theodor Kober&#x27;s failed Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen and established Dornier Flugzeugwerke. Owing to the provisions of the Versailles treaty, many of the planes were initially produced in Italy, Spain, the Netherlands or Japan, but resumed work at its Friedrichshafen and other German factories following the rise of the Nazi regime. The 1937 Hindenburg disaster and a subsequent embargo on sending American helium to Germany, however, effectively ended the production of German dirigibles. The German aeronautics industry was again banned for many years after the war, and companies again failed or shifted production.

The city&#x27;s principal recovery dates to its establishment as the administrative seat of the Bodenseekreis district of West Germany, in 1973. The last French troops withdrew from their &quot;Durand de Villers&quot; Quarter (&quot;Quartier Durand de Villers&quot;) in 1992.

== Geography ==

=== Geographical location ===
Friedrichshafen is located on a gently curved bay on the north shore of Lake Constance and on the southwest edge of the Schussen. The city is over an altitude of 395.2 m above sea level. NHH on the shores of Lake Constance up to 501.6 m in Ailingen. The core city is located not far to the west of the confluence of the Rotach and Lake Constance. Coming from Oberteuringen, this river reaches the city west of the village of Ailingen and flows through some smaller districts before it flows into the lake on the eastern edge of the city center. The somewhat larger Schussen touches the northeast corner of the urban area.

=== Neighboring communities ===
The following municipalities border the city of Friedrichshafen:

Immenstaad, Markdorf, Oberteuringen, Ravensburg, Meckenbeuren, Tettnang and Eriskich.

=== Climate ===
Friedrichshafen&#x27;s climate is mainly influenced by the Lake Constance and the nearby Alps. Compared to the Hinterland, the temperatures are rather mild. The proximity to the Alps creates foehn winds and sometimes strong thunderstorms. In addition, fog often forms in winter.
=== Border with Baden ===
The border line between the former states of Baden and Württemberg ran on the Grenzbach between Friedrichshafen, Fischbach and Immenstaad. Remains of the &quot;Grenzhof&quot; can still be found between the Bundesstraße 31 and the nature-protected shore zone.

==Economy==

===Aviation===

Airship construction in the first third of the 20th century attracted considerable industry and contributed significantly to Friedrichshafen&#x27;s relative prosperity. Friedrichshafen is best known for having been home to the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin Airship Company, the aircraft manufacturer Dornier Flugzeugwerke, ZF Friedrichshafen, a manufacturer of transmission systems and MTU Friedrichshafen GmbH, the engine manufacturing company founded by Wilhelm Maybach.

Ferdinand von Zeppelin, who was born in Konstanz (Constance), originally had his airships built in a floating airship hangar on the lake which could be aligned with the wind to support the difficult launch procedure of rigid airship flight. Today there is a large Zeppelin Museum in Friedrichshafen sited near the lake shore. In recent years the company ZLT Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik GmbH, also located in Friedrichshafen, is the constructor of small, semi-rigid airships designed by the Zeppelin firm, named (called &quot;Zeppelin NT&quot;), by using modern technology. These airships can be booked for sightseeing tours above Lake Constance.

Airbus Defence and Space maintains a site outside Friedrichshafen in Immenstaad am Bodensee, which is considered today as the successor of the &quot;Dornier Flugzeugwerke&quot; company. The Dornier Museum is located at the Friedrichshafen Airport and displays restored Dornier aviation technology as well as modern space technology.

AERO Friedrichshafen is a yearly aviation conference that hosted an attendance of 33,400 in 2011, and 30,800 in 2012. Aero 2013 took place on 24–27 April 2013 at Friedrichshafen Airport.

===Other===
Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG (MTU), the German engine manufacturing company owned by Rolls-Royce is also located in Friedrichshafen.

Apart from industry and tourism, various international regular trade fairs, such as &quot;Aero&quot; (aviation technology), &quot;Interboot&quot; (water sports), &quot;OutDoor&quot;, &quot;Motorradwelt&quot; (Motorbikes), &quot;Eurobike&quot; (bicycles) and &quot;Tuning World Bodensee&quot; (car tuning) are important economical factors. There is a large fair ground (Messe Friedrichshafen) near Friedrichshafen airport where all these and many more trade fairs take place every year. Furthermore, the Graf-Zeppelin-Haus cultural centre has become a popular location for congresses, conferences, musical and other events.

Friedrichshafen is the location for Europe&#x27;s largest ham radio convention.

==Education==

Zeppelin University, a private research university, is the only private university in the state of Baden-Württemberg to have received the rare right to confer PhD titles to its students. Only founded in 2003, its Cultural &amp; Communication Management programme has been already ranked the best university programme in that field in German speaking countries, according to the prestigious CHE ranking. The programme in Public Management &amp; Governance was ranked 4th while the programme in Corporate Management &amp; Economics was ranked 6th among all examined German, Austrian, Swiss and Dutch universities (figures from 2011). Zeppelin University holds the title of the &#x27;most committed&#x27; university in Germany with regard to civil society issues (Stifterverband für die deutsche Wissenschaft/Stiftung Mercator 2011). Ravensburg University of Cooperative Education also has a campus in Friedrichshafen.

==Sports==
VfB Friedrichshafen is a professional volleyball team based on Friedrichshafen. It is one of the top teams in Bundesliga.

== Culture ==

=== Music ===

The Seehasen-Fanfarenzug was founded in 1956 on the occasion of the Seehasenfest and Erich Deisel, a teacher at the Graf Zeppelin Gymnasium. At that time the club consisted of four drummers and two fanfare players. In 1959 the first typical yellow and red costumes reminiscent of the character from the Spanish era were designed. In 1972 the fanfare band took part in the German Championship of Fanfare Bands and came eighth place. Up until the 50th anniversary in 2006, he organized many concerts abroad and won several prizes in competitions across Germany.

The Friedrichshafen Music School was founded in 1953 as a municipal educational institution. In 2003 it moved to the newly built building near the Graf Zeppelin Gymnasium.

=== Festivals ===
Friedrichshafen has a number of town and local festivals that are held annually. Since 1985, the Kulturufer has taken place at the beginning of the summer holidays, a ten-day tent festival on the shores of Lake Constance. The performances range from music events to cabaret, drama and dance to readings, acrobatics and street theater. There is also a daily theater program for children in the tent. The Kulturufer is organized by the Culture Office and the Office for Family, Youth and Social Affairs.

One of the most famous and oldest festivals in Friedrichshafen is the Seehasenfest, a local kids festival that has been taking place since the post-war period.

==Transport==
Friedrichshafen Stadt station enjoys train services at regular intervals to Lindau and Ulm, as well as to Basel in Switzerland.

A car ferry service links Friedrichshafen to Romanshorn in Switzerland, and various other towns around the lake can also be reached by ferry. Since 2005, a fast catamaran ferry connection has been in service between Friedrichshafen and Konstanz.

Friedrichshafen Airport is the local airport. The Zeppelin manufacturing company Luftschiffbau Zeppelin (LZ) was re-established in 1993, and a commercial airline Deutsche Zeppelin Reederei (DZR) began flying passenger service from Friedrichshafen Airport in 2001. However, in recent years, passenger numbers have decreased such that, as of 2024, Friedrichshafen Airport no longer connects any domestic destinations.

The nearest big cities are Konstanz, Ravensburg, Bregenz, St. Gallen, Ulm, Augsburg, Munich, Zürich, and Stuttgart.

<doc id="98101" wikidata="Q1198466" url="?curid=98101" title="Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council">
<text>Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council (, Ulster Scots: &quot;Rathgannon an Sooth Owenslanngh Cooncil&quot;) was a local council in Northern Ireland from 1973 until 2015. It was originally named Dungannon District Council, gaining borough status and adding &quot;South Tyrone&quot; to its name on 25 November 1999, after petitioning the Secretary of State for the Environment. In May 2015, under local government reorganisation in Northern Ireland it merged with Cookstown District Council and Magherafelt District Council to become Mid-Ulster District Council.

==Subdivisions==

The main town in the district was Dungannon, where the council was headquartered. The council area covered the southern part of County Tyrone (along with a small area of County Armagh) and had a population of nearly 58,000. Its smaller towns included: Augher, Clogher, Fivemiletown, Ballygawley, Caledon, Aughnacloy, Benburb, Moy and Coalisland. The council area was divided into four electoral areas: Blackwater, Clogher Valley, Dungannon Town and Torrent. In the 2005 elections, 22 members were elected from the following political parties: 8 Sinn Féin, 5 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), 4 Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) 4 Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and 1 Éirígí (EIR). The Council adopted the d&#x27;Hondt system in 2001 which allows the position of Mayor and Deputy Mayor to be allocated according to party size. The last mayor was Councillor Michelle O&#x27;Neill (SF) and the Deputy Mayor was Councillor Norman Badger (UUP). In elections for the Westminster Parliament it was split between the Mid-Ulster and Fermanagh &amp; South Tyrone constituencies.

==Review of Public Administration==
Under the Review of Public Administration (RPA) the council was due to merge with Magherafelt District Council and Cookstown District Council in 2011 to form a single council for the enlarged area totalling 1714 km2 and a population of 120, 096. The next election was due to take place in May 2009, but on 25 April 2008, Shaun Woodward, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland announced that the scheduled 2009 district council elections were to be postponed until the introduction of the eleven new councils in 2011.

==Population==
The area covered by Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council has a population of 57,852 residents according to the 2011 Northern Ireland census.

<text>Lyfing of Winchester (died March 1046) was an Anglo-Saxon prelate who served as Bishop of Worcester, Bishop of Crediton and Bishop of Cornwall.

==Life==

Lyfing&#x27;s uncle was Burhweald, Bishop of Cornwall, according to the medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury. He was probably a monk either at Winchester Abbey or at Glastonbury Abbey. In 1009, he became Abbot of Tavistock, and that was always his favourite of the offices he held. In 1027, he became the Bishop of Crediton, and about the same time he became Bishop of Cornwall on the death of his uncle Brihtwold, so he united those two sees, with the seat at Crediton. His elevation probably was due both to his family and to his assistance to Cnut in Rome. There is also some indication he may have been a protégé of Godwin, Earl of Wessex.

In 1038 or 1039, Lyfing also became Bishop of Worcester, but was deprived of the see in 1040. King Harold Harefoot gave Worcester to Lyfing because of Lyfing&#x27;s support of Harold. His deprivation was due to King Harthacnut&#x27;s belief that Lyfing was involved in the death of Harthacnut&#x27;s half brother Alfred Atheling. Lyfing was accused by Aelfric Puttoc, the archbishop of York, who briefly replaced Lyfing at Worcester. Lyfing seems to have claimed that he was merely following the orders of Harold Harefoot. However, he was restored to Worcester in 1041 and held the three sees until his death on 20, 23 or 25 March 1046.

Lyfing was a close friend and trusted counsellor of King Canute the Great and accompanied him on a pilgrimage to Rome in 1027. Florence of Worcester, the medieval chronicler, claims that Lyfing, along with Godwin, was instrumental in securing the succession of Edward the Confessor to the throne of England on Harthacnut&#x27;s death. A tradition at Worcester also recorded that it was Lyfing, along with Archbishop Eadsige of Canterbury, who forced Sweyn Godwinson to release Eadgifu, the abbess of Leominster whom Sweyn had kidnapped. In revenge, Sweyn raided the lands of the diocese of Worcester.

Before Lyfing&#x27;s death, Aldred, who succeeded him at Worcester, had probably been acting as his suffragan or co-bishop. When Lyfing died, he chose to be buried at Tavistock Abbey. Lyfing was a pluralist and never enjoyed a good reputation. However, the D version of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; describes him as &quot;the eloquent bishop&quot;, which may imply that he was noted as an important preacher. Tavistock monks also remembered him as a great benefactor to their monastery.

<doc id="98119" wikidata="Q156447" url="?curid=98119" title="Treaty of Lunéville">
<text>The Treaty of Lunéville (or Peace of Lunéville) was signed in the Treaty House of Lunéville on 9 February 1801. The signatory parties were the French Republic and Emperor Francis II, who signed on his own behalf as ruler of the hereditary domains of the House of Austria and on behalf of the Holy Roman Empire. The signatories were Joseph Bonaparte and Count Ludwig von Cobenzl, the Austrian foreign minister. The treaty formally ended Austrian and Imperial participation in the War of the Second Coalition and the French Revolutionary Wars, as well as the Imperial Kingdom of Italy.

The Austrian army had been defeated by Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June 1800 and then by Jean Victor Moreau at the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December. Forced to sue for peace, the Austrians signed the Treaty of Lunéville, which largely confirmed the Treaty of Campo Formio (17 October 1797), which itself had confirmed the Treaty of Leoben (April 1797). The United Kingdom was the sole nation still at war with France for another year.

The Austrians would resume war against France in 1805.

==Negotiations==
On 25 December 1799, Bonaparte wrote to Francis II to propose peace. The imperial response was delayed. On 20 January 1800, Austria and Britain signed a convention of alliance against France. On 25 January, Austria responded negatively to Bonaparte&#x27;s offer. When Bonaparte renewed his offer after Marengo, however, the Austrian response was positive. A series of three negotiations followed.

Two armistices preceded the opening of negotiations: the Convention of Alessandria (15 June 1800) in Italy and the Armistice of Parsdorf (15 July) in Germany.

===First round===
Count Joseph von Saint-Julien arrived in Paris on 21 July 1800 and was received with enthusiasm. He met with French Foreign Minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord on 22–24 and 27 July. On 28 July, both signed a preliminary peace, which was mostly a copy of the Treaty of Campo Formio. The main difference was that the House of Austria was to be indemnified for its losses with territory in Italy, rather than in Germany. On 30 July, Saint-Julien left for Vienna accompanied by a French plenipotentiary, Géraud Duroc, although the French had intended for the final treaty to be signed in Paris.

Duroc was not allowed to cross the Austrian lines. Saint-Julian arrived in Vienna on 5 August, but his preliminary peace was rejected by the emperor. On 13 August, Duroc was denied a passport and given a letter from Austrian Foreign Minister Johann Amadeus von Thugut, the architect of the Anglo-Austrian alliance, to Talleyrand. Duroc returned to Paris on 20 August. It is thought that his report on the state of the Austrian forces, based on his stay at General Paul Kray&#x27;s headquarters, influenced Napoleon&#x27;s decision to launch a new offensive in September.

Shortly after Duroc had delivered the Austrian response, Saint-Julien was imprisoned and accused of signing a treaty without authorisation.

===Second round===
After the Saint-Julien fiasco, Thugut expressed a desire for Austria and Britain to negotiate together, but Napoleon rejected the idea of a peace conference. Britain, in turn, rejected French proposals for a separate peace. On 7 September, British Foreign Minister, Lord Grenville dispatched a counterproject to Paris, which contained a proposed naval armistice. The offer was received on 10 September, and Napoleon extended the armistice one week to consider the proposal, which was rejected. As a result, by the Convention of Hohenlinden of 20 September 1800, Austria ceded the fortresses of Ulm, Philippsburg and Ingolstadt to France in exchange for a one-month extension to the armistice. On 25 September, Thugut resigned as Austrian foreign minister.

===Final round===
The emperor originally nominated Ludwig Conrad von Lehrbach as his plenipotentiary for the peace talks in Lunéville. As Lehrbach had signed the Convention of Hohenlinden and caused Thugut&#x27;s fall, he was unacceptable to the British. He was replaced by Ludwig von Cobenzl, who was not initially authorised to negotiate apart from the British. The final round of negotiations thus began with a long period during which France and Austria haggled over the terms of negotiating while the armistices lapsed in late November.

The peace conference was supposed to open in Lunéville on 7 October, but Cobenzl did not arrive for over two weeks, and Lord Grenville never appeared. By 25 October, Cobenzl, without instructions, had gone from Lunéville to Paris. He left a week later, the French having failed to separate him from his British allies. Cobenzl returned for a meeting with Napoleon before his first negotiation at Lunéville on 9 November with Joseph Bonaparte. Since Cobenzl was not authorised to treat for a separate peace, and Joseph was authorised only to treat with Austria, the negotiations began at a deadlock. Joseph proposed that a secret treaty could be negotiated, with the British being invited to a public conference for appearance&#x27;s sake only after negotiations had been effectively complete and the treaty publicly signed and all earlier copies burnt, only in March 1801, after the expiration of the Anglo-Austrian alliance. The British, meanwhile, had by 23 November suspended payment of the second installment of the subsidy that they had agreed to pay Austria on 20 June.

During the negotiations at Lunéville, the French actively sought the alliance of Russia. After a rapprochement had been made, Napoleon withdrew the offer to admit a British representative under any circumstances on 7 December. On 3 December, the French had won their victory at Hohenlinden. New instructions reached Cobenzl on 26 December. He was authorised to sign a preliminary separate peace to obtain a general armistice. In fact, an armistice covering Germany had already been signed by the commanders in the field on 25 December. On 26 December, the Second League of Armed Neutrality was formed. On 27 December, Francis II informed King George III of the United Kingdom of being unable to meet his obligations as an ally. On 31 December, Cobenzl informed the French that he would negotiate without Britain.

The final negotiations concerned mainly boundaries and indemnities in Italy. The Grand Duchy of Tuscany was a major issue. The terms of Campo Formio were accepted by Austria for Germany, and only the nature and the methods of compensation for imperial princes losing territory had to be decided. As of 30 December, the emperor was offering to accept the Oglio (rather than the Adda) as the boundary of his territory in Italy if he held onto the Legations, and the Duke of Modena was indemnified for his losses in Italy, not Germany. Since the fighting continued in Italy while negotiations were underway at Lunéville, Cobenzl was forced to adjust his demands successively eastward as the French advanced in Italy. By 5 January, he was willing to accept the Chiese, by 9 January the Mincio and by 15 January the Adige and the .

On 16 January, the Austrian and French commanders in Italy concluded the Armistice of Treviso, which left the fortress of Mantua in Austrian hands. Cobenzl was not aware of that at the time of his sixth official conference with Joseph on 25 January. France demanded the cession of the fortresses of Mantua, Peschiera, Legnano, Ferrara and Ancona and the expulsion of the Grand Duke of Tuscany from Italy in return for an armistice in Italy. Since the Armistice of Steyr was expiring, both sides agreed to extend it as well. As a result, Mantua was lost to Austria.

On 1 February, France accepted an Austrian request to allow a representative of Naples and Sicily to take part in the negotiations although that did not happen. The final week was taken up by the issue of the Left Bank of the Rhine and the Empire. Austria wanted another congress like the Congress of Rastatt to make peace for the Empire. Napoleon demanded that Francis sign on behalf of himself, his own territories and the Holy Roman Empire. The treaty was finally signed at 5:00 in the evening on 9 February 1801.

==Terms==
The Treaty of Lunéville declared that &quot;there shall be, henceforth and forever, peace, amity, and good understanding&quot; among the parties. The treaty required Austria to enforce the conditions of the earlier Treaty of Campo Formio.

The independence and sovereignty of the Cisalpine, Ligurian, Batavian and Helvetic republics was recognized. The entire left bank of the Rhine, including the Austrian Netherlands, was ceded to France. Imperial Italy was also ceded by the Empire, becoming parts of France and the new Italian Republic.

Whereas Campo Formio had not affected the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, Lunéville ceded it to France. In another change from Campo Formio, certain imperial fortresses on the right bank of the Rhine were to be demolished.

Those princes who lost territory, including the Grand Duke of Tuscany and the Duke of Modena, were to be compensated with territory in Germany east of the Rhine. This was to be accomplished largely thought a programme of secularization of ecclesiastical principalities as laid out at the Congress of Rastatt. France would supervise the process. Although Austria had been promised the Archbishopric of Salzburg and some Bavarian lands at Campo Formio, those promises were withdrawn at Lunéville. The Austria acquisition of the Venetian &quot;Terraferma&quot;, Venetian Dalmatia and all of Istria was confirmed.

==Imperial deputation==

The treaty was accepted by the Imperial Diet on 7 March.

The task of compensation was left to an Imperial deputation (German: &quot;Reichsdeputation&quot;). France and Russia greatly influenced the negotiations in the Imperial Deputation, with France urging for larger new territories to be formed, which it hoped would later ally with them, and Russia favouring &quot;a more traditional balance&quot;. Eventually, the &quot;Reichsdeputationshauptschluss&quot; (Final Recess of the Imperial Deputation), the final document that reorganised the Empire, was signed on 25 February 1803. The Recess did far more than simply satisfy the need to compensate the princes, but it fundamentally restructured the Empire by secularising all ecclesiastical states except for the Electorate of Mainz. Almost all free imperial cities lost their sovereignty. The &quot;Reichsdeputationshauptschluss&quot; was the last major law in the history of the Holy Roman Empire before its dissolution in 1806.

<text>Radio waves (formerly called Hertzian waves) are a type of electromagnetic radiation with the lowest frequencies and the longest wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum, typically with frequencies below 300 gigahertz (GHz) and wavelengths greater than , about the diameter of a grain of rice. Radio waves with frequencies above about 1 GHz and wavelengths shorter than 30 centimeters are called microwaves. Like all electromagnetic waves, radio waves in vacuum travel at the speed of light, and in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at a slightly lower speed. Radio waves are generated by charged particles undergoing acceleration, such as time-varying electric currents. Naturally occurring radio waves are emitted by lightning and astronomical objects, and are part of the blackbody radiation emitted by all warm objects.

Radio waves are generated artificially by an electronic device called a transmitter, which is connected to an antenna, which radiates the waves. They are received by another antenna connected to a radio receiver, which processes the received signal. Radio waves are very commonly used in modern technology for fixed and mobile radio communication, broadcasting, radar and radio navigation systems, communications satellites, wireless computer networks and many other applications. Different frequencies of radio waves have different propagation characteristics in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere; long waves can diffract around obstacles like mountains and follow the contour of the Earth (ground waves), shorter waves can reflect off the ionosphere and return to Earth beyond the horizon (skywaves), while much shorter wavelengths bend or diffract very little and travel on a line of sight, so their propagation distances are limited to the visual horizon.

To prevent interference between different users, the artificial generation and use of radio waves is strictly regulated by law, coordinated by an international body called the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which defines radio waves as &quot;electromagnetic waves of frequencies arbitrarily lower than , propagated in space without artificial guide&quot;. The radio spectrum is divided into a number of radio bands on the basis of frequency, allocated to different uses. Higher-frequency, shorter-wavelength radio waves are called microwaves.

== Discovery and exploitation ==

Radio waves were first predicted by the theory of electromagnetism that was proposed in 1867 by Scottish mathematical physicist James Clerk Maxwell. His mathematical theory, now called Maxwell&#x27;s equations, predicted that a coupled electric and magnetic field could travel through space as an &quot;electromagnetic wave&quot;. Maxwell proposed that light consisted of electromagnetic waves of very short wavelength. In 1887, German physicist Heinrich Hertz demonstrated the reality of Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic waves by experimentally generating electromagnetic waves lower in frequency than light, radio waves, in his laboratory, showing that they exhibited the same wave properties as light: standing waves, refraction, diffraction, and polarization. Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi developed the first practical radio transmitters and receivers around 1894–1895. He received the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics for his radio work. Radio communication began to be used commercially around 1900. The modern term &quot;&quot;radio wave&quot; replaced the original name &quot;Hertzian wave&quot;&quot; around 1912.

== Generation and reception ==
Radio waves are radiated by charged particles when they are accelerated. Natural sources of radio waves include radio noise produced by lightning and other natural processes in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and astronomical radio sources in space such as the Sun, galaxies and nebulas. All warm objects radiate high frequency radio waves (microwaves) as part of their black body radiation.

Radio waves are produced artificially by time-varying electric currents, consisting of electrons flowing back and forth in a specially shaped metal conductor called an antenna. An electronic device called a radio transmitter applies oscillating electric current to the antenna, and the antenna radiates the power as radio waves. Radio waves are received by another antenna attached to a radio receiver. When radio waves strike the receiving antenna they push the electrons in the metal back and forth, creating tiny oscillating currents which are detected by the receiver.

From quantum mechanics, like other electromagnetic radiation such as light, radio waves can alternatively be regarded as streams of uncharged elementary particles called &quot;photons&quot;. In an antenna transmitting radio waves, the electrons in the antenna emit the energy in discrete packets called radio photons, while in a receiving antenna the electrons absorb the energy as radio photons. An antenna is a coherent emitter of photons, like a laser, so the radio photons are all in phase. However, from Planck&#x27;s relation formula_1, the energy of individual radio photons is extremely small, from 10−22 to 10−30 joules. So the antenna of even a very low power transmitter emits an enormous number of photons every second. Therefore, except for certain molecular electron transition processes such as atoms in a maser emitting microwave photons, radio wave emission and absorption is usually regarded as a continuous classical process, governed by Maxwell&#x27;s equations.

== Properties ==
Radio waves in vacuum travel at the speed of light formula_2. When passing through a material medium, they are slowed depending on the medium&#x27;s permeability and permittivity. Air is tenuous enough that in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere radio waves travel at very nearly the speed of light.

The wavelength formula_3 is the distance from one peak (crest) of the wave&#x27;s electric field to the next, and is inversely proportional to the frequency formula_4 of the wave. The relation of frequency and wavelength in a radio wave traveling in vacuum or air is
: formula_5
where
: formula_6
Equivalently, formula_2, the distance that a radio wave travels in vacuum in one second, is , which is the wavelength of a 1 hertz radio signal. A 1 megahertz radio wave (mid-AM band) has a wavelength of .

=== Polarization ===
Like other electromagnetic waves, a radio wave has a property called polarization, which is defined as the direction of the wave&#x27;s oscillating electric field perpendicular to the direction of motion. A plane-polarized radio wave has an electric field that oscillates in a plane perpendicular to the direction of motion. In a horizontally polarized radio wave the electric field oscillates in a horizontal direction. In a vertically polarized wave the electric field oscillates in a vertical direction. In a circularly polarized wave the electric field at any point rotates about the direction of travel, once per cycle. A right circularly polarized wave rotates in a right-hand sense about the direction of travel, while a left circularly polarized wave rotates in the opposite sense. The wave&#x27;s magnetic field is perpendicular to the electric field, and the electric and magnetic field are oriented in a right-hand sense with respect to the direction of radiation.

An antenna emits polarized radio waves, with the polarization determined by the direction of the metal antenna elements. For example, a dipole antenna consists of two collinear metal rods. If the rods are horizontal, it radiates horizontally polarized radio waves, while if the rods are vertical, it radiates vertically polarized waves. An antenna receiving the radio waves must have the same polarization as the transmitting antenna, or it will suffer a severe loss of reception. Many natural sources of radio waves, such as the sun, stars and blackbody radiation from warm objects, emit unpolarized waves, consisting of incoherent short wave trains in an equal mixture of polarization states.

The polarization of radio waves is determined by a quantum mechanical property of the photons called their spin. A photon can have one of two possible values of spin; it can spin in a right-hand sense about its direction of motion, or in a left-hand sense. Right circularly polarized radio waves consist of photons spinning in a right hand sense. Left circularly polarized radio waves consist of photons spinning in a left hand sense. Plane polarized radio waves consist of photons in a quantum superposition of right and left hand spin states. The electric field consists of a superposition of right and left rotating fields, resulting in a plane oscillation.

== Propagation characteristics ==

Radio waves are more widely used for communication than other electromagnetic waves mainly because of their desirable propagation properties, stemming from their large wavelength. Radio waves have the ability to pass through the atmosphere in any weather, foliage, and through most building materials. By diffraction, longer wavelengths can bend around obstructions, and unlike other electromagnetic waves they tend to be scattered rather than absorbed by objects larger than their wavelength.

The study of radio propagation, how radio waves move in free space and over the surface of the Earth, is vitally important in the design of practical radio systems. Radio waves passing through different environments experience reflection, refraction, polarization, diffraction, and absorption. Different frequencies experience different combinations of these phenomena in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, making certain radio bands more useful for specific purposes than others. Practical radio systems mainly use three different techniques of radio propagation to communicate:
* &quot;Line of sight&quot;: This refers to radio waves that travel in a straight line from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. It does not necessarily require a cleared sight path; at lower frequencies radio waves can pass through buildings, foliage and other obstructions. This is the only method of propagation possible at frequencies above 30 MHz. On the surface of the Earth, line of sight propagation is limited by the visual horizon to about 64 km (40 mi). This is the method used by cell phones, FM, television broadcasting and radar. By using dish antennas to transmit beams of microwaves, point-to-point microwave relay links transmit telephone and television signals over long distances up to the visual horizon. Ground stations can communicate with satellites and spacecraft billions of miles from Earth.
** &quot;Indirect propagation&quot;: Radio waves can reach points beyond the line-of-sight by &quot;diffraction&quot; and &quot;reflection&quot;. Diffraction causes radio waves to bend around obstructions such as a building edge, a vehicle, or a turn in a hall. Radio waves also partially reflect from surfaces such as walls, floors, ceilings, vehicles and the ground. These propagation methods occur in short range radio communication systems such as cell phones, cordless phones, walkie-talkies, and wireless networks. A drawback of this mode is &quot;multipath propagation&quot;, in which radio waves travel from the transmitting to the receiving antenna via multiple paths. The waves interfere, often causing fading and other reception problems.
* &quot;Ground waves&quot;: At lower frequencies below 2 MHz, in the medium wave and longwave bands, due to diffraction vertically polarized radio waves can bend over hills and mountains, and propagate beyond the horizon, traveling as surface waves which follow the contour of the Earth. This makes it possible for mediumwave and longwave broadcasting stations to have coverage areas beyond the horizon, out to hundreds of miles. Ground waves are gradually absorbed by the Earth, so the power density of the waves decreases exponentially with distance from the transmitting antenna, limiting the range of reception. As the frequency drops, the losses decrease and the achievable range increases. Military very low frequency (VLF) and extremely low frequency (ELF) communication systems can communicate over most of the Earth. VLF and ELF radio waves can also penetrate water to hundreds of meters deep, so they are used to communicate with submerged submarines.
* &quot;Skywaves&quot;: At medium wave and shortwave wavelengths, radio waves reflect off conductive layers of charged particles (ions) in a part of the atmosphere called the ionosphere. So radio waves directed at an angle into the sky can return to Earth beyond the horizon; this is called &quot;skip&quot; or &quot;skywave&quot; propagation. By using multiple skips communication at intercontinental distances can be achieved. Skywave propagation is variable and dependent on atmospheric conditions; it is most reliable at night and in the winter. Widely used during the first half of the 20th century, due to its unreliability skywave communication has mostly been abandoned. Remaining uses are by military over-the-horizon (OTH) radar systems, by some automated systems, by radio amateurs, and by shortwave broadcasting stations to broadcast to other countries.
At microwave frequencies, atmospheric gases begin absorbing radio waves, so the range of practical radio communication systems decreases with increasing frequency. Below about 20 GHz atmospheric attenuation is mainly due to water vapor. Above 20 GHz, in the millimeter wave band, other atmospheric gases begin to absorb the waves, limiting practical transmission distances to a kilometer or less. Above 300 GHz, in the terahertz band, virtually all the power is absorbed within a few meters, so the atmosphere is effectively opaque.

== Radio communication ==

In radio communication systems, information is transported across space using radio waves. At the sending end, the information to be sent, in the form of a time-varying electrical signal, is applied to a radio transmitter. The information, called the modulation signal, can be an audio signal representing sound from a microphone, a video signal representing moving images from a video camera, or a digital signal representing data from a computer. In the transmitter, an electronic oscillator generates an alternating current oscillating at a radio frequency, called the &quot;carrier wave&quot; because it creates the radio waves that &quot;carry&quot; the information through the air. The information signal is used to modulate the carrier, altering some aspect of it, encoding the information on the carrier. The modulated carrier is amplified and applied to an antenna. The oscillating current pushes the electrons in the antenna back and forth, creating oscillating electric and magnetic fields, which radiate the energy away from the antenna as radio waves. The radio waves carry the information to the receiver location.

At the receiver, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the incoming radio wave push the electrons in the receiving antenna back and forth, creating a tiny oscillating voltage which is a weaker replica of the current in the transmitting antenna. This voltage is applied to the radio receiver, which extracts the information signal. The receiver first uses a bandpass filter to separate the desired radio station&#x27;s radio signal from all the other radio signals picked up by the antenna, then amplifies the signal so it is stronger, then finally extracts the information-bearing modulation signal in a demodulator. The recovered signal is sent to a loudspeaker or earphone to produce sound, or a television display screen to produce a visible image, or other devices. A digital data signal is applied to a computer or microprocessor, which interacts with a human user.

The radio waves from many transmitters pass through the air simultaneously without interfering with each other. They can be separated in the receiver because each transmitter&#x27;s radio waves oscillate at a different rate, in other words each transmitter has a different frequency, measured in kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz). The bandpass filter in the receiver consists of one or more tuned circuits which act like a resonator, similarly to a tuning fork. The tuned circuit has a natural resonant frequency at which it oscillates. The resonant frequency is set equal to the frequency of the desired radio station. The oscillating radio signal from the desired station causes the tuned circuit to oscillate in sympathy, and it passes the signal on to the rest of the receiver. Radio signals at other frequencies are blocked by the tuned circuit and not passed on.

== Biological and environmental effects ==
Radio waves are &quot;non-ionizing radiation&quot;, which means they do not have enough energy to separate electrons from atoms or molecules, ionizing them, or break chemical bonds, causing chemical reactions or DNA damage. The main effect of absorption of radio waves by materials is to heat them, similarly to the infrared waves radiated by sources of heat such as a space heater or wood fire. The oscillating electric field of the wave causes polar molecules to vibrate back and forth, increasing the temperature; this is how a microwave oven cooks food. Radio waves have been applied to the body for 100 years in the medical therapy of diathermy for deep heating of body tissue, to promote increased blood flow and healing. More recently they have been used to create higher temperatures in hyperthermia therapy and to kill cancer cells.

However, unlike infrared waves, which are mainly absorbed at the surface of objects and cause surface heating, radio waves are able to penetrate the surface and deposit their energy inside materials and biological tissues. The depth to which radio waves penetrate decreases with their frequency, and also depends on the material&#x27;s resistivity and permittivity; it is given by a parameter called the &quot;skin depth&quot; of the material, which is the depth within which 63% of the energy is deposited. For example, the 2.45 GHz radio waves (microwaves) in a microwave oven penetrate most foods approximately .
Looking into a source of radio waves at close range, such as the waveguide of a working radio transmitter, can cause damage to the lens of the eye by heating. A strong enough beam of radio waves can penetrate the eye and heat the lens enough to cause cataracts.

Since the heating effect is in principle no different from other sources of heat, most research into possible health hazards of exposure to radio waves has focused on &quot;nonthermal&quot; effects; whether radio waves have any effect on tissues besides that caused by heating. Radiofrequency electromagnetic fields have been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as having &quot;limited evidence&quot; for its effects on humans and animals. There is weak mechanistic evidence of cancer risk via personal exposure to RF-EMF from mobile telephones.

Radio waves can be shielded against by a conductive metal sheet or screen, an enclosure of sheet or screen is called a Faraday cage. A metal screen shields against radio waves as well as a solid sheet as long as the holes in the screen are smaller than about of wavelength of the waves.

== Measurement ==
Since radio frequency radiation has both an electric and a magnetic component, it is often convenient to express intensity of radiation field in terms of units specific to each component. The unit &quot;volt per meter&quot; (V/m) is used for the electric component, and the unit &quot;ampere per meter&quot; (A/m) is used for the magnetic component. One can speak of an electromagnetic field, and these units are used to provide information about the levels of electric and magnetic field strength at a measurement location.

Another commonly used unit for characterizing an RF electromagnetic field is &quot;power density&quot;. Power density is most accurately used when the point of measurement is far enough away from the RF emitter to be located in what is referred to as the far field zone of the radiation pattern. In closer proximity to the transmitter, i.e., in the &quot;near field&quot; zone, the physical relationships between the electric and magnetic components of the field can be complex, and it is best to use the field strength units discussed above. Power density is measured in terms of power per unit area, for example, with the unit milliwatt per square centimeter (mW/cm2). When speaking of frequencies in the microwave range and higher, power density is usually used to express intensity since exposures that might occur would likely be in the far field zone.

<doc id="98141" wikidata="Q131711" url="?curid=98141" title="Kitsch">
<text>Kitsch ( ; loanword from German) is a term applied to art and design that is perceived as naïve imitation, overly eccentric, gratuitous or of banal taste. 

The modern avant-garde traditionally opposed kitsch for its melodramatic tendencies, its superficial relationship with the human condition and its naturalistic standards of beauty. In the first half of the 20th century, kitsch was used in reference to mass-produced, pop-cultural products that lacked the conceptual depth of fine art. However, since the emergence of Pop Art in the 1950s, kitsch has taken on newfound highbrow appeal, often wielded in knowingly ironic, humorous or earnest manners. 

To brand visual art as &quot;kitsch&quot; is often still pejorative, though not exclusively. Art deemed kitsch may be enjoyed in an entirely positive and sincere manner. For example, it carries the ability to be quaint or &quot;quirky&quot; without being offensive on the surface, as in the &quot;Dogs Playing Poker&quot; paintings. 

Along with visual art, the quality of kitsch can be used to describe works of music, literature or any other creative medium. Kitsch relates to camp, as they both incorporate irony and extravagance.

==History and analysis==

As a descriptive term, &quot;kitsch&quot; originated in the art markets of Munich, Germany in the 1860s and the 1870s, describing cheap, popular, and marketable pictures and sketches. In &quot;Das Buch vom Kitsch&quot; (&quot;The Book of Kitsch&quot;), published in 1936, Hans Reimann defined it as a professional expression &quot;born in a painter&#x27;s studio&quot;.

The study of kitsch was done almost exclusively in Germany until the 1970s, with Walter Benjamin being an important scholar in the field.

Kitsch is regarded as a modern phenomenon, coinciding with social changes in recent centuries such as the Industrial Revolution, urbanization, mass production, modern materials and media such as plastics, radio and television, the rise of the middle class and public educationall of which have factored into a perception of oversaturation of art produced for the popular taste.

===Kitsch in art theory and aesthetics===
Modernist writer Hermann Broch argues that the essence of kitsch is imitation: kitsch mimics its immediate predecessor with no regard to ethics—it aims to copy the beautiful, not the good. According to Walter Benjamin, kitsch, unlike art, is a utilitarian object lacking all critical distance between object and observer. According to critic Winfried Menninghaus, Benjamin&#x27;s stance was that kitsch &quot;offers instantaneous emotional gratification without intellectual effort, without the requirement of distance, without sublimation&quot;. In a short essay from 1927, Benjamin observed that an artist who engages in kitschy reproductions of things and ideas from a bygone age deserved to be called a &quot;furnished man&quot; (in the way that someone rents a &quot;furnished apartment&quot; where everything is already supplied).

Kitsch is less about the thing observed than about the observer. According to Roger Scruton, &quot;Kitsch is fake art, expressing fake emotions, whose purpose is to deceive the consumer into thinking he feels something deep and serious.&quot;

Tomáš Kulka, in &quot;Kitsch and Art&quot;, starts from two basic facts that kitsch &quot;has an undeniable mass-appeal&quot; and &quot;considered (by the art-educated elite) bad&quot;, and then proposes three essential conditions: 
# Kitsch depicts a beautiful or highly emotionally charged subject; 
# The depicted subject is instantly and effortlessly identifiable;
# Kitsch does not substantially enrich our associations related to the depicted subject.

===Kitsch in Milan Kundera&#x27;s &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;===

The concept of kitsch is a central motif in Milan Kundera&#x27;s 1984 novel &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;. Towards the end of the novel, the book&#x27;s narrator posits that the act of defecation (and specifically, the shame that surrounds it) poses a metaphysical challenge to the theory of divine creation: &quot;Either/or: either shit is acceptable (in which case don&#x27;t lock yourself in the bathroom!) or we are created in an unacceptable manner&quot;. Thus, in order for us to continue to believe in the essential propriety and rightness of the universe (what the narrator calls &quot;the categorical agreement with being&quot;), we live in a world &quot;in which shit is denied and everyone acts as though it did not exist&quot;. For Kundera&#x27;s narrator, this is the definition of kitsch: an &quot;aesthetic ideal&quot; which &quot;excludes everything from its purview which is essentially unacceptable in human existence&quot;.

The novel goes on to relate this definition of kitsch to politics, and specifically—given the novel&#x27;s setting in Prague around the time of the 1968 invasion by the Soviet Union—to communism and totalitarianism. He gives the example of the Communist May Day ceremony, and of the sight of children running on the grass and the feeling this is supposed to provoke. This emphasis on feeling is fundamental to how kitsch operates:

Kitsch causes two tears to flow in quick succession. The first tear says: How nice to see children running on the grass! The second tear says: How nice to be moved, together with all mankind, by children running on the grass! It is the second tear that makes kitsch kitsch.

According to the narrator, kitsch is &quot;the aesthetic ideal of all politicians and all political parties and movements&quot;; however, where a society is dominated by a single political movement, the result is &quot;totalitarian kitsch&quot;:

When I say &quot;totalitarian,&quot; what I mean is that everything that infringes on kitsch must be banished for life: every display of individualism (because a deviation from the collective is a spit in the eye of the smiling brotherhood); every doubt (because anyone who starts doubting details will end by doubting life itself); all irony (because in the realm of kitsch everything must be taken quite seriously).

Kundera&#x27;s concept of &quot;totalitarian kitsch&quot; has since been invoked in the study of the art and culture of regimes such as Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Kundera&#x27;s narrator ends up condemning kitsch for its &quot;true function&quot; as an ideological tool under such regimes, calling it &quot;a folding screen set up to curtain off death&quot;.

===Melancholic kitsch vs. nostalgic kitsch===
In her 1999 book &quot;The Artificial Kingdom: A Treasury of the Kitsch Experience&quot;, cultural historian Celeste Olalquiaga develops a theory of kitsch that situates its emergence as a specifically nineteenth-century phenomenon, relating it to the feelings of loss elicited by a world transformed by science and industry. Focusing on examples such as paperweights, aquariums, mermaids and the Crystal Palace, Olalquiaga uses Benjamin&#x27;s concept of the &quot;dialectical image&quot; to argue for the utopian potential of &quot;melancholic kitsch&quot;, which she differentiates from the more commonly discussed &quot;nostalgic kitsch&quot;.

These two types of kitsch correspond to two different forms of memory. Nostalgic kitsch functions through &quot;reminiscence&quot;, which &quot;sacrifices the intensity of experience for a conscious or fabricated sense of continuity&quot;:

Incapable of tolerating the intensity of the moment, reminiscence selects and consolidates an event&#x27;s acceptable parts into a memory perceived as complete. […] This reconstructed experience is frozen as an emblem of itself, becoming a cultural fossil.

In contrast, melancholic kitsch functions through &quot;remembrance&quot;, a form of memory that Olalquiaga links to the &quot;souvenir&quot;, which attempts &quot;to repossess the experience of intensity and immediacy through an object&quot;. While reminiscence translates a remembered event to the realm of the symbolic (&quot;deprived of immediacy in favour of representational meaning&quot;), remembrance is &quot;the memory of the unconscious&quot;, which &quot;sacrific[es] the continuity of time for the intensity of the experience&quot;. Far from denying death, melancholic kitsch can only function through a recognition of its multiple &quot;deaths&quot; as a fragmentary remembrance that is subsequently commodified and reproduced. It &quot;glorifies the perishable aspect of events, seeking in their partial and decaying memory the confirmation of its own temporal dislocation&quot;.

Thus, for Olalquiaga, melancholic kitsch is able to function as a Benjaminian dialectical image: &quot;an object whose decayed state exposes and reflects its utopian possibilities, a remnant constantly reliving its own death, a ruin&quot;.

==Further usage==

===Historical fiction===
Jewish-American author Art Spiegelman coined the term &quot;&quot; to describe mass-market, overly sentimental depictions of the Holocaust from the end of the Cold War onwards, including works inspired by his own graphic novel on the subject, &quot;Maus&quot;. The term is usually used to criticize works seen as relying on melodrama and mass recognition to commercialize the experiences of Holocaust survivors, such as &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; or &quot;The Boy in the Striped Pajamas&quot;, but also includes more positively received works like Polanski&#x27;s &quot;The Pianist&quot;.

===Reclamation===
The Kitsch movement is an international movement of classical painters, founded in 1998 upon a philosophy proposed by Odd Nerdrum, which he clarified in his 2001 book &quot;On Kitsch&quot;, in cooperation with Jan-Ove Tuv and others incorporating the techniques of the Old Masters with narrative, romanticism, and emotionally charged imagery.

<text>Small-C is both a subset of the C programming language, suitable for resource-limited microcomputers and embedded systems, and an implementation of that subset. Originally valuable as an early compiler for microcomputer systems available during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the implementation has also been useful as an example simple enough for teaching purposes.

The original compiler, written in Small-C for the Intel 8080 by Ron Cain, appeared in the May 1980 issue of &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot;. James E. Hendrix improved and extended the original compiler, and wrote &quot;The Small-C Handbook&quot;. Ron bootstrapped Small-C on the SRI International PDP 11/45 Unix system with an account provided by John Bass for Small C development. The provided source code was released with management permission into the public domain. Small-C was important for tiny computers in a manner somewhat analogous to the importance of GCC for larger computers. Just like its Unix counterparts, the compiler generates assembler code, which then must be translated to machine code by an available assembler.

Small-C is a retargetable compiler. Porting Small-C requires only that the back-end code generator and the library to operating system interface calls be rewritten for the target processor.

== Language subset ==
&quot;In May of 1980 Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal ran an article entitled &quot;A Small C Compiler for the 8080s&quot; in which Ron Cain presented a small compiler for a subset of the C language. The most interesting feature of the compiler besides its small size was the language in which it was written—the one it compiled. It was a self-compiler! (Although this is commonplace today, it was a fairly novel idea at the time.) With a simple, one-pass algorithm, his compiler generated assembly language for the 8080 processor. Being small, however, it had its limitations. It recognized only characters, integers, and single dimension arrays of either type. The only loop controlling device was the while statement. There were no Boolean operators, so the bitwise logical operators &amp; (AND) and | (OR) were used instead. But even with these limitations, it was a very capable language and a delight to use, especially compared to assembly language.

Recognizing the need for improvements, Ron encouraged me to produce a second version, and in December 1982 it also appeared in Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal. The new compiler augmented Small C with (1) code optimizing, (2) data initializing, (3) conditional compiling, (4) the extern storage class, (5) the for, do/while, switch, and goto statements, (6) combination assignment operators, (7) Boolean operators, (8) the ones&#x27; complement operator, (9) block local variables, and (10) various other features. Then in 1984 Ernest Payne and I developed and published a CP/M compatible run-time library for the compiler. It consisted of over 80 functions and included most of those in the UNIX C Standard I/O Library—the ones that pertained to the CP/M environment. This became version 2.1 and the subject of The Small C Handbook.

<text>Leofric (before 1016–1072) was a medieval Bishop of Exeter. Probably a native of Cornwall, he was educated on the continent. At the time Edward the Confessor was in exile before his succession to the English throne, Leofric joined his service and returned to England with him. After he became king, Edward rewarded Leofric with lands. Although a 12th-century source claims Leofric held the office of chancellor, modern historians agree he never did so.

Edward appointed Leofric as Bishop of Cornwall and Bishop of Crediton in 1046, but because Crediton was a small town, the new bishop secured papal permission to move the episcopal seat to Exeter in 1050. At Exeter, Leofric worked to increase the income and resources of his cathedral, both in lands and in ecclesiastical vestments. He was a bibliophile, and collected many manuscripts; some of these he gave to the cathedral library, including a famous manuscript of poetry, the &quot;Exeter Book&quot;. Leofric died in 1072; although his remains were moved to the new Exeter Cathedral which was built after his death, their location is no longer known and the current tomb does not mark his resting place.

==Early life==

Little is known about Leofric, as his cathedral town was not a centre of historical writing, and he took little part in events outside his diocese. Little notice was taken of his life and activities; only a few charters originated in his household and there is only one listing of gifts to his diocese. No official acts from his episcopate have survived, and there is just a brief death notice in the &quot;Leofric Missal&quot;, although no notice of his death occurs in the contemporary &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. He occurs as a witness to royal charters.

Leofric was probably born in Cornwall, and his parents were English. Because canon law required that a bishop be 30 years old when consecrated, it is likely that Leofric was born before 1016. The medieval chronicler Florence of Worcester referred to him as a &quot;Brytonicus&quot;, which presumably meant that he was a native of Cornwall. He had a brother, Ordmaer, who acted as his steward and administered the family estates. Leofric was educated in Lotharingia, and may have been brought up abroad. Leofric may have gone into exile either in 1013 when Sweyn Forkbeard, the king of Denmark invaded England or in 1016, when Sweyn&#x27;s son Cnut became king of England. His education possibly took place at the church of St Stephen&#x27;s in Toul, where the future Pope Leo IX was a canon from 1017 to 1024 and bishop after 1027.

==Service to Edward the Confessor==

Before Edward the Confessor became king of England, he was exiled to the continent. Leofric served as Edward&#x27;s chaplain, although how or when exactly the two met is unknown. The historian Frank Barlow speculates that it may have been at Bruges in 1039. When Edward returned to England at the invitation of King Harthacnut, Edward&#x27;s half-brother, Leofric accompanied him, witnessing charters during Harthacnut&#x27;s lifetime along with Herman who later became Bishop of Sherborne. Leofric remained a close supporter and friend of Edward for the king&#x27;s entire life. In 1044, Edward granted him lands at Dawlish in Devon.

Although a 12th-century monastic chronicler at Worcester called Leofric Edward&#x27;s chancellor, this is not correct, as Edward had no chancellor at this time. Historians are divided on whether or not Edward ever had an official that could be called a chancellor, but they are agreed that Leofric did not hold such an office.

==Bishop==

When Bishop Lyfing died in 1046, the king made Leofric Bishop of Cornwall as well as Bishop of Crediton. The two sees, or bishoprics, held by Lyfing became the see of Exeter in 1050 when Bishop Leofric moved his episcopal seat from Crediton to Exeter and combined it with Cornwall. The move of the see received the support of Pope Leo IX, and dates from 1051. Although Leofric had been a royal clerk before he became bishop, after his elevation he managed to avoid entanglement in the various disputes taking place between the king and Godwin, Earl of Wessex. Instead he spent his energies on the administration of his diocese, but remained on good terms with the king. Leofric&#x27;s penitential, the &quot;Leofric Missal&quot;, still survives, and it includes a prayer for a childless king, which probably referred to King Edward.

The abbey church of St. Peter&#x27;s at Exeter became Leofric&#x27;s cathedral and he was enthroned as Bishop of Exeter there on St Peter&#x27;s Day in 1050 with King Edward in attendance. The king, and his wife Edith took part in the ceremony of enthronement, with both of them leading the bishop to his cathedra, or episcopal chair. Edith had dower rights to the town of Exeter, which may explain her presence at the ceremony.

Leofric replaced the monks with canons. The new community was given the Rule of Chrodegang by Leofric, which rule he had probably learned in Lotharingia before his return to England. Leofric moved the seat of his see because Crediton was too poor and rural, and Exeter was a city with protective walls and an abandoned church that could be used as the new cathedral. Leofric claimed that he found his diocese lacking in episcopal vestments and the other items required for church services, and his surviving list of gifts to the church noted that he gave vestments, crosses, chalices, censers, altar coverings, and other furnishings to the cathedral.

After the move to Exeter, Leofric worked to increase the endowment of the diocese, and especially the cathedral library, which he found almost empty upon his arrival. He later claimed that there were only five books owned by the cathedral chapter when he became bishop. He still remained on good terms with the king, for he was present at Edward&#x27;s Christmas court in 1065 that saw the consecration of Edward&#x27;s Westminster Abbey church at Westminster. No evidence survives that Leofric was employed by the king in any diplomatic missions, nor does Leofric appear to have attended any papal councils or synods. He was a supporter of the cult of Leo IX, who was proclaimed a saint after Leo&#x27;s death.

==Death and legacy==

Leofric survived William the Conqueror&#x27;s 1068 siege of Exeter unscathed, although there is no evidence that he was present in the city during the siege. Whether Leofric had originally supported King Harold against William or if he supported William from the start is unclear. The fact that he survived William&#x27;s purge of the native English bishops in 1070 is evidence that he must not have been too outspoken against William. Leofric remained bishop until he died on 10 February or 11 February 1072. He was buried in the crypt of his cathedral. When the cathedral was rebuilt, his remains were moved to the new church, but the location of the tomb has been lost. The current tomb only dates from 1568 and does not mark Leofric&#x27;s resting place.

During Leofric&#x27;s bishopric, his cathedral library was the fourth largest in England, and was an important scriptorium. He gave an important manuscript of Old English poetry, the &quot;Exeter Book&quot;, to the cathedral library in 1072. Contained in the &quot;Exeter Book&quot; are a number of poems showing of all the principal types of poems composed in Old English. This manuscript is one of four main sources for modern knowledge of Anglo-Saxon poetry. Along with the &quot;Exeter Book&quot;, he also gave a number of other manuscripts and books to the cathedral upon his death. Three versions of the donation list drawn up by Leofric survive, which is one of the earliest surviving cathedral library catalogues. The list consists of 31 books used to conduct cathedral services, 24 other ecclesiastical works, and 11 works that were secular. This last group included philosophical works as well as poetry. The number of manuscripts that he owned and bequeathed to his cathedral was quite large for his time. Besides the &quot;Exeter Book&quot; and the &quot;Leofric Missal&quot;, Leofric&#x27;s own copy of the Rule of Chrodegang also survives, although it is no longer at Exeter. Now it is at Cambridge University, where it is Corpus Christi College MS 191. Another surviving manuscript from Leofric&#x27;s collection is a Gospel book written in Latin now in the Bodleian Library, which was probably acquired by Leofric while he was on the continent, as the manuscript was originally written for a Breton monastery. In all, about 20 of the manuscripts gifted by Leofric can be identified and are still extant, and only two remain at Exeter – including the &quot;Exeter Book&quot;.

The notice in his cathedral&#x27;s records recording his death stated that Leofric was active in his diocese as a preacher, that he built many churches in his bishopric, and was noted as a teacher of his clergy. The historian Frank Barlow describes Leofric as &quot;an able administrator and a progressive force&quot; and one who &quot;exemplifies the foreign prelate at his best&quot;.

<text>Ostholstein (; ) is a district in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is bounded by (from the southwest and clockwise) the districts of Stormarn, Segeberg and Plön, the Baltic Sea and the city of Lübeck. Geographically, the district covers the vast majority of what is considered to be the peninsular of Wagria.

==Geography==

The district consists of the Wagria peninsula between the Bay of Lübeck and the Bay of Kiel, the island of Fehmarn, the eastern part of the region called Holstein Switzerland and the northern suburbs of Lübeck.

Holsatian Switzerland is an area full of lakes and woody hills, which is shared with the adjoining district of Plön. The Bungsberg, though only 168 m in height, is the highest elevation in Schleswig-Holstein. The island of Fehmarn is the third largest island of Germany. Since 1963, it has been connected to the mainland by a suspension bridge.
==History==

The district was established in 1970 by merging the former districts of Eutin and Oldenburg in Holstein. These former districts have different histories.

The District of Eutin emerged from the Principality, and later Region of Lübeck, which again emerged from the secularised prince-bishopric of Lübeck. In 1803 it became an exclave of the Duchy of Oldenburg (which confusingly has nothing to do with the Holsteinian city of Oldenburg). In 1937 it was transferred to Prussia as the district of Eutin within the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein.

The region of Oldenburg was a part of the Duchy of Holstein. In 1864 Holstein became subordinate to Prussia, which soon afterwards established the district of Oldenburg in Holstein.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* a cross from the arms of the bishopric of Lübeck; this bishopric existed until 1535 and owned large possessions in the region
* a tower from the city arms of Oldenburg

<doc id="98164" wikidata="Q1569662" url="?curid=98164" title="Roger &amp; Me">
<text>Roger &amp; Me is a 1989 American documentary film written, produced, directed by, and starring Michael Moore, in his directorial debut. Moore portrays the regional economic impact of General Motors CEO Roger Smith&#x27;s action of closing several auto plants in his hometown of Flint, Michigan, reducing GM&#x27;s employees in that area from 80,000 in 1978 to about 50,000 in 1992.

In 2013, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Moore begins by introducing himself and his family through 8 mm archival home movies; he describes himself as the Irish American Catholic middle-class son of a General Motors employee assembling AC spark plugs. Moore chronicles how GM had previously defined his childhood in Flint, Michigan, and how the company was the primary economic and social hub of the town. He points out that Flint is the place where the Flint sit-down strike occurred, resulting in the birth of the United Auto Workers. He reveals that his heroes were the Flint natives who had escaped the oppressive life in GM&#x27;s factories, including &quot;Flint&#x27;s most famous native son,&quot; game show host Bob Eubanks. Eubanks is later interviewed in the film while preparing to do a stage version of &quot;The Newlywed Game,&quot; which sees him tell an off-color joke about Jewish women.

Initially, Moore achieves his dream of avoiding blue-collared factory life after being hired by &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine in San Francisco, but this venture fails for him and he ultimately travels back to Flint. As he returns (in 1986), GM announces the layoffs of thousands of Flint auto workers, whose jobs will be outsourced to cheaper, non-unionized labor in Mexico. GM makes this announcement even though the company is achieving record profits.

Disguised as a TV journalist, Moore interviews some auto workers in Flint and discovers their strong disgust for GM chairman Roger B. Smith. Moore begins seeking out Smith himself to confront him about the closing of the Flint plants. He repeatedly tries to visit Smith at the GM headquarters in Detroit, yet he is blocked by building security. Over the course of the film, Moore attempts to track down Smith at the Grosse Pointe Yacht Club and the Detroit Athletic Club, only to be told either that Smith is not there or to leave by employees and security guards.

From there, Moore begins to explore the emotional impact of the plant closings on his friends. He interviews Ben Hamper, an auto worker who suffered a nervous breakdown on the assembly line and is residing at a mental health facility. Moore also talks to the residents of the affluent suburb of Grand Blanc, who display classist attitudes about Flint&#x27;s hardships.

Moore changes course and turns his camera on the Flint Convention and Visitors Bureau, which promotes a vigorously incompetent tourism policy. The bureau, in an effort to lure tourists into visiting Flint, permits the construction of a Hyatt Regency Hotel, a festival marketplace called Water Street Pavilion, and AutoWorld, hailed as the world&#x27;s largest indoor theme park. All these efforts fail, as the Hyatt files for bankruptcy and is put up for sale, Water Street Pavilion sees most of its stores go out of business and AutoWorld closes six months after opening.

High-profile people are shown coming to Flint to bring hope to the unemployed, some of them interviewed by Moore. President Ronald Reagan visits the town and suggests that the unemployed auto workers find work by moving across the country, though the restaurant he visits has its cash register stolen during the event (off-camera). Pat Boone and Anita Bryant, who have supplied GM with celebrity endorsements, also come to town; Boone tells Moore that Smith is an &quot;optimistic, can-do&quot; kind of guy.

Moore attends the annual GM shareholder meeting, disguised as a shareholder himself. However, when he gets a turn at the microphone to air his grievances to the board, Smith appears to recognize Moore and immediately shuts him out and has the convention adjourned, despite Moore&#x27;s attempts to interrupt him. Meanwhile, Moore meets and interviews more residents of Flint, who are reeling from the economic fallout of the layoffs. A former feminist radio host, Janet, joins Amway as a saleswoman to find work. Another resident, Rhonda Britton, sells rabbits for &quot;Pets or Meat.&quot; Prevalent throughout the film is Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy Fred Ross, a former factory worker whose current job now demands that he go around town carrying out record numbers of evictions on families unable to pay their rent.

During all of this, Flint&#x27;s crime rate skyrockets, with shootouts and murders becoming much more common. Crime becomes so prevalent that when the ABC News program &quot;Nightline&quot; tries to do a live story on the plant closings, someone steals the network&#x27;s van (along with the cables), abruptly stopping the broadcast. The county jail also fills to its maximum capacity of inmates, and a second jail is built due to the over-crowding. Living in Flint becomes so desperate that &quot;Money&quot; magazine ranks the city as the worst place to live in America.

At the film&#x27;s climax, Moore finally confronts Smith at the chairman&#x27;s annual 1988 Christmas message in Detroit. Smith is shown expounding about generosity during the holiday season, concurrently as Deputy Ross evicts another family from their home. After Smith&#x27;s speech, Moore hounds Smith, addressing him from a distance.

After the credits, the film displays the message &quot;This film cannot be shown within the city of Flint,&quot; followed by &quot;All the movie theatres have closed.&quot;

==Production==
Moore decided to make the film after losing his job as the editor of &quot;Mother Jones&quot; and moving back to his former home town of Flint, Michigan, as it was suffering from deindustrialization due to General Motors&#x27; layoffs. After his attempt to restart the Flint Voice newspaper faltered, Moore decided to make a documentary on the city&#x27;s economic crisis. Initially, he intended to make it under the title &quot;The Moores and the Motts,&quot; contrasting his working-class family with the upper-class family descended from Charles Stewart Mott, but later shifted focus to the current U.S. automobile industry. Moore intended the film as a personal statement condemning not just GM but also the economic policies and social attitudes of the Reagan era, which he felt allowed corporations to remove the largest source of income from an entire town.

At the time Moore decided to make the documentary in 1984, he had no experience in filmmaking or funds to produce the film. To get the money, he filed a successful wrongful termination lawsuit against &quot;Mother Jones&quot; for $160,000. He also mortgaged his house, sold most of his belongings, and arranged a three-year series of weekly bingo games to raise the remainder of the film&#x27;s $200,000 budget. He also began teaching himself film technique, spending hours at local cinemas. Eventually Moore received grant awards from the J. Roderick MacArthur Foundation, the Channel Four Television Corporation, the Michigan Council for the Arts, and Ralph Nader. The Mackinac Center donated $5,000 to the film but later requested it to be refunded. Nader also requested that the $30,000 he donated to the production be returned. He claimed that the nonprofit group Essential Information had donated the funds with the understanding that Moore would start a newsletter that never operated, and an associate of Nader&#x27;s accused Moore of drawing ideas for &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot; from Nader&#x27;s book &quot;The Big Boys&quot;.

&quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot; was filmed under the working title &quot;A Humorous Look at How General Motors Destroyed Flint, Michigan&quot;. Moore and his crew decided after viewing a 15-minute bumper from the film that the depiction of mass unemployment would be too depressing for mainstream audiences, and decided to give it a humorous slant. Production began on February 11, 1987, on the 50th anniversary of the Flint sit-down strike. A large proportion of the filming was done in a 60-day period during the summer of 1988. Moore obtained interviews by pretending to be filming University of Michigan videos on poverty or booster films promoting the city. The production concluded in August 1989.

Moore was mentored during the production by documentarians Christopher Beaver, Anne Bohlen, Judy Irving, and Kevin Rafferty. Moore had previously assisted on Bohlen and Rafferty&#x27;s film &quot;Blood in the Face&quot;.

The film had its worldwide premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 1989. It was well received by the Canadian audience with it winning the coveted TIFF People&#x27;s Choice Award. Coincidentally, only a few weeks later, GM would announce the closing of their Toronto truck assembly plant, moving vehicle production to a plant in Flint, Michigan.

Moore briefly entered negotiations with Disney to distribute the film, meeting with CEO Michael Eisner. Warner Bros. gave Moore $3 million for distribution license, a very large amount for a first-time filmmaker and (at the time) unprecedented for any documentary. Part of the distribution deal required Warner Bros. to pay $25,000 in rent for two years for the families evicted in the film. Moore also donated 20,000 free tickets to unemployed Americans, stipulated that between 30 and 40 percent of his and the producers&#x27; profits would be donated to a new non-profit foundation supporting similar political documentaries.

To promote the film&#x27;s planned national release in 965 theaters, Moore and the film&#x27;s crew toured 65 GM plants around the country making demands such as a visit by Smith to Flint. During the film&#x27;s marketing campaign, GM and some commentators challenged the veracity of the film&#x27;s claims. GM refused to allow advertisements to its automobiles to play during television programs promoting the film, including an episode of &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot; filmed live at the Whiting Auditorium and an episode of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; featuring Moore as a guest. After Moore&#x27;s appearance, GM&#x27;s media relations chief Bill Ott mailed guest host Jay Leno a packet of news articles challenging his claims.

The film premiered in Flint on December 19, 1989, and was released in New York City and Los Angeles one day later. It went on to become America&#x27;s most successful documentary in its theatrical run and enjoyed wide critical acclaim, earning $12 million. Moore used $1 million of the film&#x27;s gross to donate to charities such as the National Union of the Homeless, Earth First!, the Jewish Women&#x27;s Coalition to End the Occupation, and the United Auto Workers faction New Directions. He also allocated $10,000 to rent payments or homeless shelters around Flint, and $20,000 to revive the Flint Voice.

Despite its success, the film was not nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1990. The film&#x27;s lack of a nomination was controversial; on the night of the 62nd Academy Awards, Moore attended a ceremony arranged by homelessness activists across the street which presented him with a &quot;People&#x27;s Award.&quot; Three years later, an anonymous member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences confirmed to &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; that the film was deliberately not nominated because the documentary committee believed it was &quot;dishonest and unfair to its subjects.&quot;

===Reaction to the film===
Despite the company&#x27;s public opposition to the film, its humorous and out-of-touch portrayal of Smith made it widely popular inside GM. By the time of the film&#x27;s release, GM had lost 8% of its market share and was taking on significant financial losses, leading many employees and executives to become disillusioned with Smith&#x27;s leadership.

By the time the film was released, Flint was making a slight economic recovery in which unemployment, violent crime, and the local government&#x27;s budget deficit declined. As a result, many commentators questioned the veracity of the film, accusing Moore of falsifying or embellishing details.

Larry Stecco, a lifetime Flint area resident and personal injury lawyer, discussed positive aspects of Flint (such as the local ballet and hockey) at a Great Gatsby-themed fundraiser. Stecco, who was filmed in front of two African-Americans posing as human statues, alleged that the film&#x27;s unflattering portrayal of him had been unfair. Stecco filed a lawsuit against Moore and Warner Bros, claiming that Moore had falsely told him he was making a booster film for Flint&#x27;s local PBS affiliate. After reviewing outtakes from the film, a jury sided with Stecco and ordered Moore to pay $6,250. Moore later expressed satisfaction with the decision since the slander charges were dismissed and because the settlement was less than the sought-after $50,000.

===Legacy===
Moore allowed the film to be aired on television for the first time as part of the PBS series &quot;P.O.V.&quot; in 1992. The broadcast included a new short documentary by Moore called &quot;Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint&quot; (1992), which served as a new epilogue. In this film, Moore returns to Flint two years after the release of &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot; to see what changes have taken place. Moore revisits Flint and its economic decline again in later films, including &quot;The Big One&quot;, &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;, &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, &quot;Fahrenheit 11/9&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. In 2013, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Critical reception==

The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. Film critic Emanuel Levy called the film &quot;scathingly funny&quot; and likened it to the works of Mark Twain. Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert both put the film on their lists of The 10 Best Films of 1989.

In contrast, Pauline Kael felt the film exaggerated the social impact of GM&#x27;s closing of the plant and depicted the actual events of Flint&#x27;s troubles out of chronological order. Kael called the film &quot;shallow and facetious, a piece of gonzo demagoguery that made me feel cheap for laughing&quot;. One such criticism is that the eviction at the end of the film occurred on a different day from Smith&#x27;s speech, but the two events were intercut for emotional effect. Filmmaker Emile de Antonio was also critical of the film. Ebert defended the film from those who criticized it for exaggerations and inaccuracies, writing that in the film, Moore &quot;was taking the liberties that satirists and ironists have taken with material for generations, and he was making his point with sarcasm and deft timing.&quot;

In 2007 during the promotion of Moore&#x27;s documentary &quot;Sicko,&quot; a documentary was released named &quot;Manufacturing Dissent: Uncovering Michael Moore&quot;, which featured a clip of a question-and-answer exchange between Moore and Smith at a 1987 GM shareholders&#x27; meeting it alleged had been filmed for but not included in &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot;. Moore acknowledged the encounter (described by the &quot;Associated Press&quot; as &quot;about a company tax abatement, as reported by &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine in 1990&quot;) but claimed it pre-dated the start of his work on the film and had nothing to do with it, and argued that had he omitted footage of an interview with Smith GM would have used it to discredit the film. In a 2014 oral history compiled by MLive to commemorate the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary, the film&#x27;s cinematographer Bruce Schermer recalled of the interview that Moore “Probably gave him 10 questions&quot;, “mainly what&#x27;s the plan for Flint and how many jobs are going to be lost,” and that “Roger Smith couldn&#x27;t give him the final answer and maybe he didn&#x27;t want to. He gave pretty boring answers. He was as honest as he was going to be.”

Critic Billy Stevenson described the film as Moore&#x27;s &quot;most astonishing&quot;, arguing it represents an effort to conflate film-making and labor, and that &quot;it&#x27;s this fusion of film-making and work that allows Moore to fully convey the desecration of Flint without ever transforming it into a sublime or melancholy poverty-spectacle, thereby distancing himself from the retouristing of the town-as-simulacrum that occupies the last and most intriguing part of the film&quot;. Eubanks later described Moore as not a documentarian but a &quot;propagandist&quot;.

==Awards==
The film would go on to win over 14 awards in the years since its release including:

<text>The ancient Egyptians believed that a soul ( and ; Egypt. pron. ka/ba) was made up of many parts. In addition to these components of the soul, there was the human body (called the &quot;ḥꜥ&quot;, occasionally a plural &quot;&quot;, meaning approximately &quot;sum of bodily parts&quot;).

According to ancient Egyptian creation myths, the god Atum created the world out of chaos, utilizing his own magic (ḥkꜣ). Because the earth was created with magic, Egyptians believed that the world was imbued with magic and so was every living thing upon it. When humans were created, that magic took the form of the soul, an eternal force which resided in and with every human. The concept of the soul and the parts which encompass it has varied from the Old Kingdom to the New Kingdom, at times changing from one dynasty to another, from five parts to more. Most ancient Egyptian funerary texts reference numerous parts of the soul:

Collectively, these spirits of a dead person were called the &quot;Akh&quot; after that person had successfully completed its transition to the afterlife. Egyptologist R. David, at the University of Manchester, explains the many facets of the soul as follows:

The Egyptians believed that the human personality had many facets—a concept that was probably developed early in the Old Kingdom. In life, the person was a complete entity, but if he had led a virtuous life, he could also have access to a multiplicity of forms that could be used in the next world. In some instances, these forms could be employed to help those whom the deceased wished to support or, alternately, to take revenge on his enemies.
==&quot;Khet&quot; (physical body)==
The &quot;&quot; (Egyptological spelling: &quot;khet&quot;), or physical form, had to exist for the soul (&quot;kꜣ&quot;/&quot;bꜣ&quot;) to have intelligence or the chance to be judged by the guardians of the underworld. Therefore, it was necessary for the body to be preserved as efficiently and completely as possible and for the burial chamber to be as personalized as it could be, with paintings and statuary showing scenes and triumphs from the deceased&#x27;s life. In the Old Kingdom, only the pharaoh was granted mummification and, thus, a chance at an eternal and fulfilling afterlife. By the Middle Kingdom, all dead were afforded the opportunity. Herodotus, an ancient Greek scholar, observed that grieving families were given a choice as to the type and or quality of the mummification they preferred: &quot;The best and most expensive kind is said to represent [Osiris], the next best is somewhat inferior and cheaper, while the third is cheapest of all.&quot;

Because the state of the body was tied so closely with the quality of the afterlife, by the time of the Middle Kingdom, not only were the burial chambers painted with depictions of favourite pastimes and great accomplishments of the dead, but there were also small figurines (&quot;ushabtis&quot;) of servants, slaves, and guards (and, in some cases beloved pets) included in the tombs, to serve the deceased in the afterlife.

Before a person could be judged by the gods, they had to be &quot;awakened&quot; through a series of funerary rites designed to reanimate their mummified remains in the afterlife. The main ceremony, the opening of the mouth ceremony, is best depicted within Pharaoh Seti I&#x27;s tomb. All along the walls and statuary inside the tomb are reliefs and paintings of priests performing the sacred rituals and, below the painted images, the text of the liturgy for opening of the mouth can be found. This ritual which, presumably, would have been performed during interment, was meant to reanimate each section of the body: brain, head, limbs, etc. so that the spiritual body would be able to move in the afterlife.

==&quot;Sah&quot; (spiritual body)==

If all the rites, ceremonies, and preservation rituals for the &quot;ẖt&quot; were observed correctly, and the deceased was found worthy (by Osiris and the gods of the underworld) of passing through into the afterlife, the &quot;&quot; (&quot;sah&quot;; spiritual representation of the physical body) forms. This spiritual body was then able to interact with the many entities extant in the afterlife. As a part of the larger construct, the ꜣḫ, the &quot;sꜥḥ&quot; was sometimes seen as an avenging spirit which would return from the underworld to seek revenge on those who had wronged the spirit in life. A well-known example was found in a tomb from the Middle Kingdom in which a man leaves a letter to his late wife who, it can be supposed, is haunting him:

What wicked thing have I done to thee that I should have come to this evil pass? What have I done to thee? But what thou hast done to me is to have laid hands on me although I had nothing wicked to thee. From the time I lived with thee as thy husband down to today, what have I done to thee that I need hide? When thou didst sicken of the illness which thou hadst, I caused a master-physician to be fetched ... I spent eight months without eating and drinking like a man. I wept exceedingly together with my household in front of my street-quarter. I gave linen clothes to wrap thee and left no benefit undone that had to be performed for thee. And now, behold, I have spent three years alone without entering into a house, though it is not right that one like me should have to do it. This have I done for thy sake. But, behold, thou dost not know good from bad.

==&quot;Ren&quot; (name, identity)==
A person&#x27;s name, or &quot;rn&quot; ( &#x27;name&#x27;) was an essential aspect of individuality and central to one&#x27;s survival after death. Most ancient Egyptian names embodied a meaning which was believed to have a direct relationship with its owner. Placing a name on a statue ceded the image to the dead named, providing a second body. The obliteration of a name from an object or monument destroyed this connection and in some cases was done intentionally to hinder one&#x27;s prospects in the afterlife.
==&quot;Ba&quot; (personality)==



The (Egyptological pronunciation: &quot;ba&quot;) 𓅽 was everything that makes an individual unique, similar to the notion of &#x27;personality&#x27;. In this sense, inanimate objects could also have a bꜣ, a unique character, and indeed Old Kingdom pyramids often were called the bꜣ of their owner. The bꜣ is an aspect of a person that the Egyptians believed would live after the body died, and it is sometimes depicted as a human-headed bird flying out of the tomb to join with the kꜣ in the afterlife.

In the Coffin Texts, one form of the bꜣ that comes into existence after death is corporeal—eating, drinking and copulating. Egyptologist Louis Vico Žabkar argues that the bꜣ is not merely a part of the person &quot;but is the person himself&quot;, unlike the soul in Greek, or late Judaic, Christian or Muslim thought. The idea of a purely immaterial existence was so foreign to Egyptian thought that when Christianity spread in Egypt, they borrowed the Greek word &quot;psychē&quot; to describe the concept of soul instead of the term bꜣ. Žabkar concludes that so particular was the concept of the bꜣ to ancient Egyptian thought that it ought not to be translated but instead the concept be footnoted or parenthetically explained as one of the modes of existence for a person.

In another mode of existence the bꜣ of the deceased is depicted in the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; returning to the mummy and participating in life outside the tomb in non-corporeal form, echoing the solar theology of Ra uniting with Osiris each night.

The word &quot;bꜣw&quot; (&quot;baw&quot;), plural of the word bꜣ, meant something similar to &quot;impressiveness&quot;, &quot;power&quot;, and &quot;reputation&quot;, particularly of a deity. When a deity intervened in human affairs, it was said that the bꜣw of the deity were at work.
==&quot;Ka&quot; (vital essence)==

The &quot;kꜣ&quot; (&quot;ka&quot;), 𓂓, was the Egyptian concept of vital essence, which distinguishes the difference between a living and a dead person, with death occurring when the kꜣ left the body. The Egyptians believed that Khnum created the bodies of children on a potter&#x27;s wheel and inserted them into their mothers&#x27; bodies. Depending on the region, Egyptians believed that Heqet or Meskhenet was the creator of each person&#x27;s kꜣ, breathing it into them at the instant of their birth as the part of their soul that made them be &quot;alive&quot;.

The Egyptians also believed that the kꜣ was sustained through food and drink. For this reason food and drink offerings were presented to the dead, although it was the kꜣ within the offerings that was consumed, not the physical aspect. In the Middle kingdom a form of offering tray known as a soul house was developed to facilitate this. The kꜣ was often represented in Egyptian iconography as a second image of the king, leading earlier works to attempt to translate kꜣ as &quot;double&quot;.

In the Old Kingdom private tombs, artwork depicted a &quot;doubleworld&quot; with essential people and objects for the owner of the ka. As Ancient Orient Curator Andrey Bolshakov explains:
&quot;The notion of the ka was a dominating concept of the next life in the Old Kingdom. In a less pure form, it lived into the Middle Kingdom, and lost much of its importance in the New Kingdom, although the ka always remained the recipient of offerings.&quot;

==&quot;Ib&quot; (heart)==
An important part of the Egyptian soul was thought to be the &quot;&quot; (&quot;ib&quot;), or heart. In the Egyptian religion, the heart was the key to the afterlife. 

It was essential to surviving death in the nether world, where it gave evidence for, or against, its possessor. Like the physical body (&quot;ẖt&quot;), the heart was a necessary part of judgement in the afterlife and it was to be carefully preserved and stored within the mummified body with a heart scarab carefully secured to the body above it to prevent it from telling tales. According to the text of the &quot;Books of Breathing&quot;:
:They drag Osiris into the Pool of Khonsu, ... and likewise [the Osirism Hor, justified] born of Taikhebyt, justified ... after he has grasped his heart. They bury ... the Book of Breathings which [Isis] made, which ... is written on both its inside and outside, (wrapped) in royal linen, and it is placed [under] the ... left arm near his heart.

It was thought that the heart was examined by Anubis and the deities during the Weighing of the Heart ceremony. If the heart weighed more than the feather of Maat, it was immediately eaten by the monster Ammit, and the soul became eternally restless.

==&quot;Shut&quot; (shadow)==
A person&#x27;s shadow or silhouette, &quot;šwt&quot; (&quot;shut&quot;), is always present. Because of this, Egyptians surmised that a shadow contains something of the person it represents. Through this association, statues of people and deities were sometimes referred to as shadows.

In a commentary to &quot;The Egyptian Book of the Dead&quot; (&quot;BD&quot;), Egyptologist Ogden Goelet, Jr. discusses the forms of the shadow:

In many &quot;BD&quot; papyri and tombs the deceased is depicted emerging from the tomb by day in shadow form, a thin, black, featureless silhouette of a person. The person in this form is, as we would put it, a mere shadow of his former existence, yet nonetheless still existing. Another form the shadow assumes in the &quot;BD&quot;, especially in connection with gods, is an ostrich-feather sun-shade, an object which would create a shadow.

==&quot;Sekhem&quot; (power, form)==
Little is known about the Egyptian interpretation of this portion of the soul. Many scholars define &quot;sḫm&quot; (&quot;sekhem&quot;) as the living force or life-force of the soul which exists in the afterlife after all judgement has been passed. It is defined in a &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; as the &quot;power&quot; and as a place within which Horus and Osiris dwell in the underworld.
==&quot;Akh&quot; (intellect)==
The &quot;(magically) effective one&quot; was a concept of the dead that varied over the long history of ancient Egyptian belief. Relative to the afterlife, akh represented the deceased, who was transfigured and often identified with light.

It was associated with thought, but not as an action of the mind; rather, it was intellect as a living entity. The ꜣḫ also played a role in the afterlife. Following the death of the ẖt (physical body), the bꜣ and kꜣ were reunited to reanimate the ꜣḫ. The reanimation of the ꜣḫ was only possible if the proper funeral rites were executed and followed by constant offerings. The ritual was termed s-ꜣḫ &quot;make (a dead person) into an (living) ꜣḫ&quot;. In this sense, it developed into a sort of roaming ghost (when the tomb was not in order any more) during the Twentieth Dynasty. An ꜣḫ could do either harm or good to persons still living, depending on the circumstances, causing, e.g., nightmares, feelings of guilt, sickness, etc. It could be invoked by prayers or written letters left in the tomb&#x27;s offering chapel also in order to help living family members, e.g., by intervening in disputes, by making an appeal to other dead persons or deities with any authority to influence things on earth for the better, but also to inflict punishments.

The separation of ꜣḫ and the unification of kꜣ and bꜣ were brought about after death by having the proper offerings made and knowing the proper, efficacious spell, but there was an attendant risk of dying again. Egyptian funerary literature (such as the Coffin Texts and the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;) were intended to aid the deceased in &quot;not dying a second time&quot; and to aid in becoming an ꜣḫ.

==Relationships==
Ancient Egyptians believed that death occurs when a person&#x27;s kꜣ leaves the body. Ceremonies conducted by priests after death, including the &quot;opening of the mouth (&quot;wp r&quot;)&quot;, aimed not only to restore a person&#x27;s physical abilities in death, but also to release a &quot;ba&quot;″s attachment to the body. This allowed the bꜣ to be united with the kꜣ in the afterlife, creating an entity known as an ꜣḫ.

Egyptians conceived of an afterlife as quite similar to normal physical existence – but with a difference. The model for this new existence was the journey of the Sun. At night the Sun descended into the Duat or &quot;underworld&quot;. Eventually the Sun meets the body of the mummified Osiris. Osiris and the Sun, re-energized by each other, rise to new life for another day. For the deceased, their body and their tomb were their personal Osiris and a personal Duat. For this reason they are often addressed as &quot;Osiris&quot;. For this process to work, some sort of bodily preservation was required, to allow the bꜣ to return during the night, and to rise to new life in the morning. The complete &quot;ꜣḫ&quot;s were also thought to appear as stars. Until the Late Period, non-royal Egyptians did not expect to unite with the Sun deity; this was reserved for royals.

The &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, the collection of spells which aided a person in the afterlife, had the Egyptian name of the &quot;Book of going forth by day&quot;. They helped people avoid the perils of the afterlife and also aided their existence, containing spells to ensure &quot;not dying a second time in the underworld&quot;, and to &quot;grant memory always&quot; to a person. In the Egyptian religion it was possible to die in the afterlife and this death was permanent.

The tomb of Paheri, an Eighteenth Dynasty nomarch of Nekhen, has an eloquent description of this existence, and is translated by James Peter Allen as:

<text>The archaeology of the Americas is the study of the archaeology of the Western Hemisphere, including North America (Mesoamerica), Central America, South America and the Caribbean. This includes the study of pre-historic/pre-Columbian and historic indigenous American peoples, as well as historical archaeology of more recent eras, including the trans-Atlantic slave trade and European colonization.

==Chronology==

The pre-Columbian era is the term generally used to encompass all time period subdivisions in the history of the Americas spanning the time from the original settlement of the Americas in the Upper Paleolithic until the European colonization of the Americas during the early modern period. While technically referring to the era before the voyages of Christopher Columbus from AD 1492 to 1504, in practice the term usually includes the history of American indigenous cultures until the 18th or 19th century. In more recent decades, archaeological scholarship has extended to include enslaved Africans and European and Asian migrant populations.

The pre-Columbian archaeological record in the Americas has conventionally been divided into five phases based on an enduring system established by Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips&#x27;s 1958 book &quot;Method and Theory in American Archaeology&quot;. Their chronology differs from old world prehistory from Europe and Asia which uses the three-age system, with the Stone Age divided into Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Chalcolithic, followed by the Bronze Age and Iron Age, remain in general use.
Numerous regional and sub-regional divisions have since been defined to distinguish various cultures through time and space, as later archaeologists recognized that these generalised stages did not adequately correspond to the cultural variation that existed in different locations in the Americas.
* Lithic stage
:Defined by the ostensible prevalence of big-game hunting. In most places, this can be dated to before 8000 BCE, starting most probably around 16,500 BCE (see Paleo-Indians). Examples include the Clovis culture and Folsom tradition groups.
* The Archaic stage
:Defined by the increasingly intensive gathering of wild resources with the decline of the big-game hunting lifestyle. Typically, Archaic cultures can be dated from 8000 to 1000 BCE. Examples include the Archaic Southwest, the Arctic small tool tradition, the Poverty Point culture, and the Chan-Chan culture in southern Chile.
* The Formative stage
:Defined as &quot;village agriculture&quot; based. Most of these can be dated from 1000 BCE to 500 CE. Examples include the Dorset culture, Zapotec civilization, Mimbres culture, Olmec, Woodland, and Mississippian cultures.
* The Classic stage

:Defined as &quot;early civilizations&quot;, and typically dating from 500 to 1200 CE. Willey and Phillips considered only cultures from Mesoamerica and Peru to have achieved this level of complexity. Examples include the early Maya and the Toltec.
* The Post-Classic stage
:Defined as &quot;later prehispanic civilizations&quot; and typically dated from 1200 CE until the advent of European colonisation. The late Maya, the Incan civilization, and the Aztec cultures were Post-Classic.

Today, for Meso- and Andean South America, the later periods are more often classified using the &quot;Horizon&quot; terminology, with &quot;Early Horizon&quot; typically broadly equating to the Late Formative stage. &quot;Horizons&quot; are periods of cultural stability and political unity, with &quot;Intermediate periods&quot; covering the politically fragmented transition between them. In the Andes, there are three Horizon periods, with two Intermediate periods between them. The Horizons, and their dominant cultures are: Early Horizon, Chavin; Middle Horizon, Tiwanaku and Wari culture; Late Horizon, Inca.

==Major regions==

===North America===
==== NAGPRA ====
Since 1990, in the United States, physical anthropology and archaeological investigations based on the study of human remains are influenced by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, (NAGPRA), which provides for the bodies of Native Americans and associated grave goods to be turned over to the recognized tribal body most legally affiliated with the remains; the law applies only to culturally identifiable remains and artefacts found on federally owned public land. In some cases, notably, that of Kennewick Man, these laws have been subject to close judicial scrutiny and great intellectual conflict.
===Mesoamerica===

Mesoamerica is a region and cultural area in the Americas, extending approximately from central Mexico to Honduras and Nicaragua, within which a number of pre-Columbian societies flourished before the Spanish colonization of the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries. Prehistoric groups in this area are characterized by agricultural villages and large ceremonial and politico-religious capitals This culture area included some of the most complex and advanced cultures of the Americas, including the Olmec, Teotihuacan, the Maya, and the Aztec, the most powerful tribe of Mesoamerica in their time.

===South America===
Important South American societies include the Moche, the Inca, the Wari.

Important South American archaeological sites include: Chavín de Huántar, Pikillaqta, Machu Picchu, Tiwanaku, Monte Verde, and the Upano Valley sites.

=== Central America ===
Central America is a region and cultural area in the Americas located south of Mesoamerica extending from Nicaragua to the southern border of Panama. Important sites include the Stone Spheres of Costa Rica.

==Archaeogenetics==
Molecular genetics study suggests that &quot;surviving&quot; Amerindian populations derived from a theoretical single founding population, possibly from only 50 to 70 genetic contributors. Preliminary research, restricted to only 9 genomic regions (or loci) have shown a genetic link between original Americas and Asia populations. The study does not address the question of separate migrations for these groups, and excludes other DNA data-sets.

The &quot;American Journal of Human Genetics&quot; released an article in 2007 stating, &quot;Here we show, by using 86 complete mitochondrial genomes, that all Indigenous American haplogroups, including Haplogroup X (mtDNA), were part of a single founding population.&quot; Amerindian groups in the Bering Strait region exhibit perhaps the strongest DNA or mitochondrial DNA relations to Siberian peoples. The genetic diversity of Amerindian indigenous groups increase with distance from the assumed entry point into the Americas. Certain genetic diversity patterns from West to East suggest at least some coastal migration events. Geneticists have variously estimated that peoples of Asia and the Americas were part of the same population from 42,000 to 21,000 years ago.
== Archaeological finds ==

In February 2021, archaeologists from the University of Buenos Aires–National Scientific and Technical Research Council announced the discovery of 12 graves dated to 6,000–1,300 years ago in Argentine Northwest. Researchers also revealed necklaces and pendants next to some of the bodies. According to archaeologist Leticia Cortés, there were many kinds of burial methods, in individual or collective graves, and also in the posture of the bodies. Some were hyperflexed, like squatting, with the shoulders touching the knees.

In 2018, 9000-year-old remains of a female hunter along with a toolkit of projectile points and animal processing implements were discovered at the Andean site of Wilamaya Patjxa, Puno District in Peru.

In September 2021, archaeologists announced the remains of eight 800-year-old bodies nearby ancient town of Chilca. Bodies included adults and children who were covered in plant material before being buried. Some dishes and musical instruments were uncovered as well. Researchers think remains belong to the Chilca culture, which was apart from other pre-Hispanic cultures in the area.

A mummy that is approximately 800 years old that is believed to be of pre-Inca cultures was found at the site of Cajamarquilla in Peru in November 2021. Researchers reported that the mummy was tied with strings, covering his face with his hands, so they assumed it was a southern Peruvian funeral custom. In February 2022, archaeologists announced the discovery of six mummified children thought to have been sacrificed, probably to accompany a dead elite man to the afterlife. According to archaeologist Pieter Van Dalen, 1,000-1,200 years old mummies were probably relatives and placed one above the other in different parts of the tomb.

In May 2022, archaeologists reported the discovery of 1,400-year-old remains of the Mayan site so-called Xiol on the outskirts of Mérida. They also uncovered a large central plaza and at least 12 buildings, workshops, burial places of adults and children, and an altar that served a ritual purpose.

In June 2022, archaeologists from the Mexico&#x27;s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) announced the discovery of a 1,300-year-old nine-inch-tall plaster head statue indicating a young Hun Hunahpu, the Maya&#x27;s mythological maize god. The figure&#x27;s semi-shaved haircut that resembles ripe corn gives reason to the possibility that it is a young maize god. Researchers assume that the Mayan inhabitants of Palenque possibly placed a large stone statuette over a pond to represent the entrance to the underworld. According to archaeologist Arnoldo González Cruz, the Mayan people symbolically shuttered the pool by breaking up some of the plaster and filling it with animal remains, including pottery fragments, carved bone remains, shells, obsidian arrowheads, beads, vegetables, and others.

<text>The Report of the Departmental Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution (better known as the Wolfenden report, after Sir John Wolfenden, the chairman of the committee) was published in the United Kingdom on 4 September 1957 after a succession of well-known men, including Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, Michael Pitt-Rivers, John Gielgud, and Peter Wildeblood were convicted of homosexual offences.

==Background==
Under the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, any homosexual activity between males was illegal. After the Second World War, there had been an increase in arrests and prosecutions, and by the end of 1954, in England and Wales, there were 1,069 men in prison for homosexual acts, with a mean age of 37 years. During a time of several significant trials, notably that of Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, the Conservative government set up a departmental committee (in the Home Office and Scottish Home Department responsible for criminal law) under Sir John Wolfenden to consider both homosexual offences and prostitution.

==Committee==
The committee of 15 (4 women and 11 men) was led by Sir John Wolfenden (1906–1985), a former headmaster of both Uppingham School and of Shrewsbury School; and who in 1950 was appointed Vice Chancellor of the University of Reading. He later became Director of the British Museum.

In addition to the chairman, the committee members were the following:
* James Adair, former Procurator-Fiscal for Glasgow
* Mary Cohen, vice-president of the City of Glasgow Girl Guides and chairwoman of the Scottish Association of Girls&#x27; Clubs
* Desmond Curran, senior psychiatrist at St George&#x27;s Hospital, London, and psychiatric consultant to the Royal Navy
* V. A. Demant, Anglo-Catholic priest serving as Canon of Christ Church, Oxford, and Regius Professor of Moral and Pastoral Theology at the University of Oxford
* Sir Kenneth Diplock, Recorder of Oxford and High Court judge
* Sir Hugh Linstead, Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Putney, barrister, and pharmaceutical chemist
* Peter Kerr, 12th Marquess of Lothian, a Foreign Office minister
* Kathleen Lovibond, chairwoman of the Uxbridge juvenile magistrates&#x27; court and member of the Conservative women&#x27;s organisation who became Mayor of Uxbridge in 1956
* Victor Mishcon, solicitor and Labour member and chairman of the London County Council
* Goronwy Rees, Principal of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth (resigned from the committee in April 1956)
* R. F. V. Scott, Presbyterian minister of St Columba&#x27;s Church, London (Church of Scotland) (resigned from the committee in March 1956)
* Lady (Lily) Stopford, ophthalmologist and magistrate
* William Wells, Labour MP for Walsall North and barrister
* Joseph Whitby, general practitioner with psychiatric experience

The committee first met on 15 September 1954 and met on 62 days, 32 of which were used for interviewing witnesses. Wolfenden suggested at an early stage that, for the sake of the ladies in the room, they use the terms Huntley &amp; Palmers after the biscuit manufacturers – Huntleys for homosexuals, and Palmers for prostitutes. Evidence was heard from police and probation officers, psychiatrists, religious leaders (who in those days were at the forefront of homosexual law reform), and gay men whose lives had been affected by the law.

The estimated cost of preparing the report was £8,046 of which £735 represented the estimated cost of printing and publication. The secretary for the committee was W. C. Roberts (Home Office) and his assistant was E. J. Freeman (Scottish Home Department).

Getting gay men to give evidence proved to be very difficult for the committee: Wolfenden considered placing an advert in a newspaper or magazine, but the committee instead decided to locate three men willing to give evidence: Peter Wildeblood, Carl Winter, and Patrick Trevor-Roper. Wildeblood had been convicted and sent to prison. Winter was director of the Fitzwilliam Museum and Trevor-Roper was an eye surgeon and brother of the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper. In order to protect their identities, Trevor-Roper was referred to as the &quot;Doctor&quot; while Winter was referred to as &quot;Mr White&quot;.

==Recommendations==
The committee recommended that &quot;homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence&quot;. All but James Adair were in favour of this and, contrary to some medical and psychiatric witnesses&#x27; evidence at that time, found that &quot;homosexuality cannot legitimately be regarded as a disease, because in many cases it is the only symptom and is compatible with full mental health in other respects.&quot; The report added:

The recommended age of consent was 21 years (the age of majority in the UK then, though for mixed sex couples the age of consent was 16 and 16-year-olds could marry with their parents&#x27; permission).

The report also discussed the rise in street prostitution at the time, which it associated with &quot;community instability&quot; and &quot;weakening of the family&quot;. As a result, there was a police crackdown on street prostitution following the report and the Street Offences Act 1959 was passed.

==Aftermath==
The report&#x27;s recommendations attracted considerable public debate, including an exchange of views in publications by Lord Devlin, a leading British judge, whose ideas and publications argued against the report&#x27;s philosophical basis, and H. L. A. Hart, a leading jurisprudential scholar, who provided argument in its support.

In &quot;The Enforcement of Morals&quot;, Devlin states that the Wolfenden report &quot;is recognized to be an excellent study of two very difficult legal and social problems&quot;. Devlin attacks the principle, derived from John Stuart Mill&#x27;s &quot;On Liberty&quot;, that the law ought not concern itself with &quot;private immorality&quot;, saying that the report &quot;requires special circumstances to be shown to justify the intervention of the law. I think that this is wrong in principle&quot;.

In late 1957, shortly after the report was published, the General Assembly of the Church of England, by a vote of 155 to 138, passed a resolution &quot;That this Assembly generally approves the principles on which the criminal law concerned with sexual behaviour should be based as stated by the Wolfenden Committee, and also its recommendations relating to homosexuality, but considers that the recommendations relating to prostitution require further study&quot;.

The recommendations eventually led to the passage of the Sexual Offences Act 1967, applying to England and Wales only, that replaced the previous law on sodomy contained in the Offences against the Person Act 1861 and the 1885 Labouchere Amendment which outlawed every homosexual act short of sodomy. The Act did not become law until a decade after the report was published in 1957.

The historian Patrick Higgins has described a number of flaws with the report: &quot;its failure to understand or appreciate (except in the most negative terms) the importance of the homosexual subculture&quot;. 

It later became known publicly, (in 2017), that Wolfenden&#x27;s son Jeremy Wolfenden was gay when historian Roger Lockyer stated the fact in a BBC interview.

In 1997, John Wolfenden came 45th in the &quot;Pink Paper&quot;’s list of the “top 500 lesbian and gay heroes”.

<text>Andjety (meaning &quot;He of Andjet&quot;) is a local ancient Egyptian deity of the ninth nome, centered at Andjet, which was known as Busiris to the Greeks. This deity is also known by the alternative names Anezti &quot;or&quot; Anedjti. Andjety is considered one of the earliest Egyptian gods, possibly with roots in prehistoric Egypt.

Andjety is thought to have been a precursor of Osiris. Like Osiris, he is depicted holding the crook and flail and has a crown similar to Osiris&#x27;s Atef crown. Pharaoh Sneferu of the Fourth Dynasty, builder of the first true pyramid, is shown wearing the crown of Andjety. In the Pyramid Texts the deceased pharaoh is identified with Andjety. In the temple of Seti I, the pharaoh is shown offering incense to Osiris-Andjety who is accompanied by Isis.

He also is shown to have fertility aspects, being known by the epithet &quot;bull of vultures&quot;. His name is sometimes written with a substitution of a stylized uterus for the feather in the hieroglyphs.
==Writings mentioning Andjety==

* Coffin Text V-385 – “I immerse the waterways as Osiris, Lord of corruption, as Adjety, bull of vultures.”

* Coffin Text I-255 – “O Horus Lord of Life, far downstream and upstream from Andjety, make inspection of those who are in Djedu, come and go in Rosetau, clear the vision of those who are in the underworld. Farther upstream from Rosetau to Abydos, the primeval place of the Lord of All.&quot;

* Coffin Text IV-331 – “O Thoth vindicate Osiris against his foes in:--- the great tribunal which is in the two banks of the kite on the night of the drowning of the great god in Andjety.&quot;

* Pyramid texts 182 – “In your name the one who is in Andjet headman of his nomes&quot;

* Pyramid texts 220 – “May your staff be the head of the spirits, as Anubis who presides over the Westerners, and Andjety who presides over the eastern nomes&quot;

* Pyramid texts 614 – “Horus has revived you in this your name of Andjety&quot;

<doc id="98192" wikidata="Q5097834" url="?curid=98192" title="Child custody laws in the United States">
<text>Child custody, conservatorship and guardianship describe the legal and practical relationship between a parent and the parent&#x27;s child, such as the right of the parent to make decisions for the child, and the parent&#x27;s duty to care for the child.

Custody issues typically arise in proceedings involving divorce, as well as in paternity, annulment, and other legal proceedings in which children are involved. In most jurisdictions the issue of with which parent the child will reside is determined in accordance the best interests of the child standard. In rare cases custody may be awarded to somebody other than a parent, but only after the fundamental right afforded to biological parent&#x27;s has been overcome or where the third party has an established role that is in the manner of a parent. When a child&#x27;s parents are not married it is necessary to establish paternity before issues of child custody or support may be determined by a court.

Family law proceedings that involve issues of custody and visitation often generate the most acrimonious disputes. In extreme cases, one parent may accuse the other of trying to &quot;turn&quot; the child(ren) against him or her, allege some form of emotional, physical, or even sexual abuse by the other parent, the &quot;residential&quot; parent may disrupt the other parent&#x27;s contact or communication with the child(ren), or a parent may remove the child from the jurisdiction in violation of court orders, so as to frustrate the other parent&#x27;s contact with the children.

Courts and legal professionals within the U.S. may use terms such as &quot;parenting time&quot; instead of custody and visitation. The goal of the newer, alternative terminology is to eliminate the distinction between custodial and noncustodial parents, and to better focus on the best interests of the children by crafting schedules that meet the developmental needs of the children. For example, small children may need shorter, more frequent time with parents, whereas older children and teenagers can tolerate and may demand less frequent shifts, but longer blocks of time with each parent.

==History==
In the decades leading up to the 1970s child custody battles were rare, and in most cases the mother of minor children would receive custody. Since the 1970s, as custody laws have been made gender-neutral, contested custody cases have increased as have cases in which the children are placed in the primary custody of the father.

== State law ==

=== New York ===
Where there are children of the marriage residing in New York State and under the age of 18, a demand for custody is mandatory in divorce actions. Whether the parents are divorced or just separated one parent cannot demand the child stays between the parents. Where the children reside outside New York State custody may not be determined, except in some instances by stipulation. Custody may not be awarded to a person other than the father or mother, except under unusual circumstances that require a hearing. In unusual circumstances, children may be placed with a third party such as a grandparent or a sibling. Children under the age of 18 must be supported by both parents to the extent that they are able to support the children under the provisions of the Child Support Standards Act.

=== New Jersey ===

New Jersey courts require all divorcing parents with minor children to complete a mandatory Parents&#x27; Education Program before granting a divorce per the Parent&#x27;s Education Act. The law, , enacted in 1999, was established to promote cooperation between the parties and to assist in resolving issues that arrive during the divorce process that may impact a child. However, courts will not refer a party to the program if a restraining order has been issued pursuant to the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act or if either party is restrained from contact under the criminal or civil laws of New Jersey or any other state.

=== Texas ===

In the State of Texas, rather than using the term &quot;custody&quot;, a parent who is granted custody of a child by a court is deemed a &quot;conservator&quot;. Conservatorship is divided into two categories, a &quot;managing conservator&quot; and a &quot;possessory conservator.&quot;
*The first time a court must make a decision about conservatorship, a court may presume that both parents should be Joint Managing Conservators. When joint managing conservatorship is awarded, the parties or the judge must decide on how to divide the rights and duties, which is written into the decree.
*However, the court may alternatively appoint a &quot;Sole Managing Conservator&quot; with one or more &quot;Possessory Conservators&quot;. In doing so, the Judge can weigh a history of domestic violence, or whether the parent has had little prior contact or relationship with the child when considering restrictions on rights and possession. The possessory conservator may be virtually eliminated from the process of making decisions concerning health, education and welfare. The sole managing conservator takes sole responsibility for a child, making all the important decisions regarding health (both mental and physical), education, and moral or religious upbringing alone.

Conservatorship orders divide various parental rights and duties, including

:(1) the right to make major decisions regarding the children;

:(2) the right to have physical possession of the children; and

:(3) the duty to financially support the children among the parents after the divorce.

== Rights of grandparents ==
In &quot;Troxel v. Granville&quot; (2000), the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that a biological parent holds a fundamental right in choosing how to raise one&#x27;s children as they see fit, and that right includes limiting the children’s access to their grandparents.

In &quot;In re O&#x27;Donnell-Lamont&quot; (2004), the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed an Oregon statute requiring a presumption the parent acts in the child&#x27;s best interests to be met prior to applying the best interests of the child standard, placing both parties on equal footing. Likewise, the court upheld the requirement set forth mandating that either a child-parent relationship or a long-term personal relationship existed between the child and non-blood related intervenor under the concept of the fundamental right of the parent. The court noted that the issue in itself allowed for an intervenor with a legitimate purpose to come forth, and through the statute&#x27;s requirement of first showing the relationship, second showing the rebuttal of the presumption, and finally judging the choice on the best interest of the child standard, the fundamental right of the parent was being given proper Due Process Requirements under the 14th Amendment Due Process Clause.

== Military parents and child custody ==
In the 21st century, a new body of case law for custody of children in military families is developing due to more frequent deployments of both mothers and fathers in active duty, as well as dual-career military couples.

==Contrast with other countries==
Following ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in most countries other than the United States (which has not ratified the convention), terms such as &quot;custody&quot; and &quot;access&quot; (known as &quot;visitation&quot; in the United States) have been superseded in many countries by the concepts of &quot;residence&quot; and &quot;contact&quot;. Instead of a parent having &quot;custody&quot; of or &quot;access&quot; to a child, a child is now said to &quot;reside&quot; or have &quot;contact&quot; with a parent. For a discussion of the new international standards, see parental responsibility.

<text>Arensnuphis (in Egyptian: Iryhemesnefer, &quot;ỉrỉ-ḥms-nfr&quot;, &quot;the good companion&quot;) is a deity from the Kingdom of Kush, first attested at Musawwarat el-Sufra in the 3rd century BC. His worship spread to the Egyptian-controlled portion of Kush in the Ptolemaic Period (305–30 BC). His mythological role is unknown; he was depicted as a lion and as a human with a crown of feathers and sometimes a spear.

Arensnuphis was worshipped at Philae, where he was called the &quot;companion&quot; of the Egyptian goddess Isis, as well as at Dendur. In the ancient Egyptian religion, the Egyptians syncretized him with their gods Anhur and Shu.

<doc id="98205" wikidata="Q368305" url="?curid=98205" title="Alimony">
<text>Alimony, also called [[aliment]] (Scotland), maintenance (England, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Wales, Canada, New Zealand), spousal support (U.S., Canada) and spouse maintenance (Australia), is a legal obligation on a person to provide financial support to their spouse before or after marital separation or divorce. The obligation arises from the divorce law or family law of each country. In most jurisdictions, it is distinct from child support, where, after divorce, one parent is required to contribute to the support of their children by paying money to the child&#x27;s other parent or guardian.

==Etymology==
The term alimony comes from the Latin word , from . Also derived from this word are the terms alimentary , and aliment .

==History==

The Code of Hammurabi (1754 BC) declares that a man must provide sustenance to a woman who has borne him children so that she can raise them:

: 137. If a man wish to separate from a woman who has borne him children, or from his wife who has borne him children: then he shall give that wife her dowry, and a part of the usufruct of field, garden, and property, so that she can rear her children. When she has brought up her children, a portion of all that is given to the children, equal as that of one son, shall be given to her. She may then marry the man of her heart.

The above law only applies to women who had children with her husband. This fits more closely with the definition of child support in some jurisdictions.

Alimony is also discussed in the Code of Justinian.

The modern concept of alimony is derived from English ecclesiastical courts that awarded alimony in cases of separation and divorce. &quot;Alimony pendente lite&quot; was given until the divorce decree, based on the husband&#x27;s duty to support the wife during a marriage that still continued. &quot;Post-divorce&quot; or &quot;permanent alimony&quot; was also based on the notion that the marriage continued, as ecclesiastical courts could only award a &quot;divorce a mensa et thoro&quot;, similar to a legal separation today. As divorce did not end the marriage, the husband&#x27;s duty to support his wife remained intact.

Liberalization of divorce laws occurred in the 19th century, but divorce was only possible in cases of marital misconduct. As a result, the requirement to pay alimony became linked to the concept of fault in the divorce. Alimony to wives was paid because it was assumed that the marriage, and the wife&#x27;s right to support, would have continued but for the misbehavior of the husband. Ending alimony on divorce would have permitted a guilty husband to profit from his own misconduct. In contrast, if the wife committed the misconduct, she was considered to have forfeited any claim to ongoing support. However, during this period, parties could rarely afford alimony, and so it was rarely awarded by courts. As husbands&#x27; incomes increased, and with it the possibility of paying alimony, the awarding of alimony increased, generally because a wife could show a need for ongoing financial support, and the husband had the ability to pay. No-fault divorce led to changes in alimony. Whereas spousal support was considered a right under the fault-based system, it became conditional under the no-fault approach. According to the American Bar Association, marital fault is a &quot;factor&quot; in awarding alimony in 25 states and the District of Columbia. Permanent alimony has begun to fall out of favor because it encourages the alimony recipient to not remarry so that they will continue to receive money from their ex-spouse. However, many states still have permanent alimony awards. 

In the 1970s, the United States Supreme Court ruled against gender bias in alimony awards and, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the percentage of alimony recipients who are male rose from 2.4% in 2001 to 3.6% in 2006. In states like Massachusetts and Louisiana, the salaries of new spouses may be used in determining the alimony paid to the previous partners. Most recently, in several high-profile divorces, women such as Britney Spears, Victoria Principal, and Jessica Simpson have paid multimillion-dollar settlements in lieu of alimony to ex-husbands. According to divorce lawyers, aggressive pursuit of spousal support by men is becoming more common, as the stigma associated with asking for alimony fades.

==Reckoning==

Once dissolution proceedings commence, either party may seek interim or pendente lite support during the course of the litigation.

Where a divorce or dissolution of marriage (civil union) is granted, either party may ask for post-marital alimony. It is not an absolute right, but may be granted, the amount and terms varying with the circumstances. If one party is already receiving support at the time of the divorce, the previous order is not automatically continued (although this can be requested), as the arguments for support during and after the marriage can be different.

Unless the parties agree on the terms of their divorce in a binding written instrument, the court will make a determination based on the legal argument and the testimony submitted by both parties. This can be modified at any future date based on a change of circumstances by either party on proper notice to the other party and application to the court. The courts are generally reluctant to modify an existing agreement unless the reasons are compelling. In some jurisdictions the court always has jurisdiction to grant maintenance should one of the former spouses become a public charge.

==By country==
===Canada===
Types of spousal support

In Canada, spousal support may be awarded upon divorce, under the federal &quot;Divorce Act&quot;, or upon separation without divorce under provincial statutes. There are generally three different forms of spousal support awarded:

# Compensatory support – This form of support compensates an individual for her or his contributions to the relationship as well as for any losses that individual has suffered;
# Non-compensatory support – In some cases support may be awarded on a needs basis. This form of support may be awarded by a Court where an individual is sick or disabled; and
# Contractual support (divorce agreement) – This form of support upholds a contract between the parties which governs support payments.

Married spouses and common-law spouses

Both married spouses and common-law spouses may be entitled to spousal support. An important distinction between the two is that common-law spouses must start an action claiming spousal support within one year of the breakdown of the relationship. A second important distinction is that only married couples may divorce under the federal &quot;Divorce Act&quot;, common-law spouses may only separate under provincial legislation, such as Ontario&#x27;s &quot;Family Law Act&quot; or British Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Family Relation&#x27;s Act&quot;. No such limitation arises for married individuals.
In addition to being in a marriage or common-law relationship, courts will look at the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse. This includes:

# The length of time the spouses cohabited;
# The functions performed by each spouse during the relationship; and
# Any existing orders or agreements.

This is by no means an exhaustive list of factors which the court will consider when determining entitlement. Each case is determined on its own unique set of circumstances.

Factors for awarding spousal support

The federal &quot;Divorce Act&quot; at s.15.2 (6) states that there are four objectives of spousal support orders:

# Recognize any economic advantages or disadvantages to the spouses arising from the marriage or its breakdown;
# Apportion between the spouses any financial consequences arising from the care of any child of the marriage over and above any obligation for the support of any child of the marriage;
# Relieve any economic hardship of the spouses arising from the breakdown of the marriage; and
# In so far as practicable, promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse within a reasonable period of time.

Amount and duration

The longer the length of cohabitation and the greater the disparity between each party’s incomes, the larger an award of spousal support will be and the longer the duration will be. Although there is no set formula to determine the exact amount and duration of spousal support, there are guidelines, referred to as the &quot;Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines&quot;, which provides ranges for both. the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines calculate ranges for support after taking into account the relevant factors. Although the courts are not required to abide by the &quot;Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines&quot;, they are required to take them into account when deciding on the issue of spousal support. The length of the relationship will be taken into account when determining how long spousal support should be paid for. Awards for spousal support can be for a limited term or indefinite.

While declaring bankruptcy does not absolve Canadians of obligations to pay alimony or child support, a 2011 ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada established that under current laws &quot;equalization payments agreed to as part of a divorce are considered debts, and are wiped off a person&#x27;s balance sheet when they declare bankruptcy.&quot;

=== Czech Republic ===
Laws of the Czech Republic provide for spousal maintenance both during marriage and after divorce. As main principle, both spouses have the right for generally equal standard of living during the marriage.

The same &quot;generally equal standard of living&quot; applies also to post-divorce period in special cases, when the payee wasn&#x27;t mostly responsible for the failure of marriage or did not agree with the divorce and the payee suffered serious harm due to the divorce and hadn&#x27;t committed an act of domestic violence against the payer. In such case the payee may request alimony in amount providing &quot;generally equal standard of living&quot; for a period adequate to circumstances, but no longer than three years.

If those special conditions are not met, both of the divorced have mutual spousal maintenance obligation in case that one of them is not able to provide for themselves due to circumstances originating in marriage, if payment of alimony is reasonable under general circumstances that each of the divorced found themselves in.

=== England ===
English courts award spousal maintenance, either in a lump sum or in installments, when one party cannot support themselves without payments from the other party.

Under traditional English common law, a woman gave up her personal property rights on marriage (see Coverture). Upon separation from marriage, the husband retained the right to the wife&#x27;s property, but, in exchange, had an ongoing responsibility to support the wife after dissolution of the marriage. English law was amended by legislation including the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1870 and Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1882 which reformed women&#x27;s property rights relating to marriage, by, for example, permitting divorced women to regain the property they owned before marriage.

=== India ===
Alimony in India is governed by personal laws based on religion:

Hindus: Governed by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (Section 24 for pendente lite, Section 25 for permanent alimony).

Christians: Governed by the Divorce Act, 1869 (Section 36 for pendente lite, Section 37 for permanent alimony).

Parsis: Governed by the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act (Section 39 for pendente lite, Section 40 for permanent alimony).

Secular: Special Marriage Act, 1954 (Section 36 for pendente lite, Section 37 for permanent alimony).

=== Italy ===
The duty of mutual assistance of the spouses turns into an obligation of maintenance following the personal separation. The spouse who is not responsible for the separation has, in fact, the right to receive from the other &quot;what is necessary for its maintenance&quot; (Article 156 of the Italian Civil Code).

In case of dissolution of the marriage, art. 5, paragraph 6, of Law 898/1970 provides for the obligation for a spouse to periodically provide the other with a check &quot;when the latter does not have adequate means or in any case cannot obtain them for objective reasons&quot;, the determination of which it is entrusted to certain specific parameters (conditions of the spouses, reasons for the decision, personal and economic contribution given by each to the family management and to the formation of the patrimony of each or the common one, income of both, duration of marriage).

=== Japan ===
Under the Japanese Civil Code, spousal support is available while the parties are married, but terminates upon divorce. Japanese courts typically award a one-time payment of &quot;isha-ryo&quot;, or consolation money, to the &quot;wronged&quot; spouse in the divorce, a type of compensation which does not exist in some other jurisdictions such as most U.S. states.

=== United States ===
In the U.S., state law establishes requirements regarding alimony (and child support) payments, recovery and penalties. A spouse trying to recover back alimony sometimes may use only the collection procedures that are available to all other creditors, such as reporting the amount due to a collection agency, or seek enforcement through contempt of court proceedings against an obligor who is able to pay but has failed to do so. Alimony obligations are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.

The determination of alimony varies greatly from state to state within the U.S. Some state statutes, including those of Texas, Montana, Kansas, Utah, Kentucky and Maine, give explicit guidelines to judges on the amount and/or duration of alimony. In Texas, Mississippi and Tennessee, for example, alimony is awarded only in cases of marriage or civil union of ten years or longer and the payments are limited to three years unless there are special, extenuating circumstances. Also, in case of Texas, there is a legal presumption while dealing with a spousal maintenance case, that the alimony isn&#x27;t appropriate. Once the requesting spouse can reasonably demonstrate that he/she has given the best effort in good faith to secure an independent income but failed, only then the case is taken into consideration. Furthermore, the amount of spousal support in Texas is limited to the lesser of $5,000 per month or 20% of the payee&#x27;s gross income. In Delaware, spousal support is usually not awarded in marriages of less than 10 years. In Kansas, alimony awards cannot exceed 121 months. In Utah, the duration of alimony cannot exceed the length of the marriage. In Maine, Mississippi, and Tennessee alimony is awarded in marriages or civil union of 10 to 20 years and the duration is half the length of the marriage barring extenuating circumstances. Other states, including California, Nevada and New York, have relatively vague statutes which simply list the &quot;factors&quot; a judge should consider when determining alimony (see list of factors below). In these states, the determination of duration and amount of alimony is left to the discretion of the family court judges who must consider case law in each state. In Mississippi, Texas and Tennessee, for example, there are 135 Appellate Cases in addition to 47 sections of State Statute that shape divorce law. As a result of these Appellate Cases, for example, Mississippi judges cannot order an end date to any alimony award. In 2012, Massachusetts signed into law comprehensive alimony reform. This law sets limits on alimony and eliminates lifetime alimony. Similarly, in 2013, Colorado signed into law alimony reform, creating a standardized non-presumptive guideline upon which courts can rely.

In general, there are four types of alimony:

# Temporary alimony: Support ordered when the parties are separated prior to divorce. Also called &quot;alimony pendente lite&quot;, which is Latin, meaning, &quot;pending the suit&quot;.
# Rehabilitative alimony: Support given to a lesser-earning spouse for a period of time necessary to acquire work outside the home and become self-sufficient.
# Permanent alimony: Support paid to the lesser-earning spouse until the death of the payor, the death of the recipient, or the remarriage of the recipient.
# Reimbursement alimony: Support given as a reimbursement for expenses incurred by a spouse during the marriage (such as educational expenses).

Some of the possible factors that bear on the amount and duration of the support are:
====Prenuptial agreements====
Prenuptial agreements are recognized in all fifty states and the District of Columbia, and every jurisdiction allows parties to agree to spousal support and alimony terms in a premarital or postnuptial agreement, if their marital agreement is prepared in accordance with state and federal law requirements.  Divorce courts retain the discretion to refuse to enforce prenuptial agreement terms restricting a party’s right to seek alimony if that party would have to seek public assistance as a result of the alimony waiver, or if the restriction on the right to seek alimony is unconscionable or unfair when the divorce occurs. Lack of financial disclosure prior to signing a prenuptial agreement or a post-nuptial agreement by the party against whom alimony is sought may also cause a court to invalidate a waiver of alimony provision.  Prenuptial Agreements with valid alimony waivers or restrictions entered into in one state should be fully enforceable by the courts of another state in the event of a divorce, unless the terms of the prenuptial agreement violate the foreign jurisdiction&#x27;s laws.

California is the only state with a law that requires that the parties be represented by counsel if spousal support (alimony) is limited by the agreement.

Instead of a complete waiver of the right to seek alimony, prenuptial agreements and post-nuptial agreements can also contain terms where the parties agree to a set amount of guaranteed alimony for the lower wage earner at the time of divorce, or a cap/limit on the amount of alimony either party can seek in the event of a divorce.

==== Reform ====
In the United States, family laws and precedents as they relate to divorce, community property and alimony vary based on state law. Also, with new family models, &quot;working couples&quot;, &quot;working wives&quot;, &quot;stay-at-home dads&quot;, etc., there are situations where some parties to a divorce question whether traditional economic allocations made in a divorce are fair and equitable to the facts of their individual case. Some groups have proposed various forms of legislation to reform alimony parameters (i.e. amounts and term). Alimony terms are among the most frequent issues causing litigation in family law cases. Eighty percent of divorce cases involve a request for modification of alimony.

Some states (e.g. Florida, Texas, Maine) are moving away from permanent alimony awards that are intended to maintain a spouse&#x27;s standard of living enjoyed during the marriage and are moving towards durational or rehabilitative alimony. In other states, like Mississippi and Tennessee, alimony is usually awarded for life.

Some of the critical issues that proponents and opponents of alimony reform disagree upon are:
* Whether alimony should be temporary or permanent
* Regardless of duration, should alimony payers have the unquestionable right to retire?
* Does the lesser earning spouse deserve alimony to meet his or her basic needs (sustenance) or enough to sustain &quot;the lifestyle accustomed to during the civil union or marriage&quot;?
* Should the income and assets of a new spouse be used in determining how much alimony gets paid?
* How clear and prescriptive should state statutes be versus allowing a larger degree of Judicial Discretion?

In 2012, bills were introduced in the New Jersey Assembly and Senate. The Assembly passed a bill calling for a Blue Ribbon Commission to address Alimony Reform. The Senate has a similar bill pending that has not yet been posted in the Judiciary Committee. The NJ Matrimonial Bar Association has been vehemently fighting against Alimony Reform, led by Patrick Judge Jr. chairman of the Family Law section of the New Jersey State Bar Association. Attorney Judge stated that the New Jersey State Bar Association (&quot;NJSBA&quot;) objected to the inclusion of individuals with a vested interest in reforming alimony on the Blue Ribbon Commission and that the NJSBA supported the &quot;establishment of a commission [to study alimony reform] but only as long as the commission is constituted so that a fair and unbiased review of the current alimony laws takes place…[and] should not be predisposed to an outcome….&quot;

In 2023 Florida passed an alimony reform bill (SB 1416) which eliminated permanent alimony and established a process for allowing alimony payers to request modifications when they want to retire. The bill allowed judges to reduce or terminate alimony obligations based on a number of factors. The passage came after decades of contentious debate garnering three vetoes of similar bills. Some groups that were previously major opponents of the reform approved of the 2023 policy, such as Florida Family Fairness and The Florida Bar.

California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Oklahoma, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and West Virginia have all passed laws that allow for the modification or termination of alimony upon demonstration that the recipient is cohabitating with another person. In April 2009, the Governor of New Jersey, Jon Corzine, signed into law changes in the alimony statutes for his state which would bar alimony payments to parents who kill, abuse, or abandon their children.

==== Taxation ====
In divorces and separation agreements signed on December 31, 2018 and earlier, alimony is tax-deductible for the payer, and treated as taxable income for the recipient. Pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, for divorce judgments dated January 1, 2019 and later, spousal support is treated as not-taxable and non-deductible for either party.

<text>Ba-Pef was a minor underworld god in Egyptian mythology. The name literally means &quot;that Ba&quot;, meaning &quot;that soul&quot; ().

<doc id="98213" wikidata="Q797676" url="?curid=98213" title="Babi (mythology)">
<text>Babi, also Baba, in ancient Egyptian religion, was the deification of the hamadryas baboon, one of the animals present in ancient Egypt. His name is usually translated as &quot;bull of the baboons&quot;, roughly meaning &quot;chief of the baboons&quot;.

Baboons are extremely aggressive and omnivorous, and Babi was viewed as being very bloodthirsty, and living on entrails. Consequently, he was viewed as devouring the souls of the sinful after they had been weighed against Maat (the concept of truth/order), and was thus said to stand by a lake of fire, representing destruction. Since this judging of righteousness was an important part of the underworld, Babi was said to be the first-born son of Osiris, the god of the dead in the same regions in which people believed in Babi.

Baboons also have noticeably high libidos, in addition to their high level of genital marking, and so Babi was considered the god of virility of the dead. He was usually portrayed with an erection, and due to the association with the judging of souls, was sometimes depicted as using it as the mast of the ferry which conveyed the righteous to Aaru, a series of islands. One spell in a funerary text identifies the deceased person&#x27;s phallus with Babi, ensuring that the deceased will be able to have sexual intercourse in the afterlife.

== Mythology ==

The Papyrus Jumilhac describes a mythological conflict between the gods Thoth and Babi. In the story, Babi, depicted as a red dog with yellow eyes, accuses Thoth of theft before the Ennead and the sun god Ra. However, the Ennead rejects the accusation, as they did not witness the alleged crime. When Babi continues to spread rumors about Thoth, the latter retaliates by anointing Babi’s sleeping phallus with his writing reed and casting a spell upon him. This enchantment causes Babi’s penis to swell during intercourse, making it impossible for him to separate from his partner. When Babi engages in intercourse with an unnamed female, his penis swells, and he becomes trapped. Thoth then convenes the Great and Small Ennead, mocking Babi’s exposed testicles. Ra declares Babi guilty, though the exact nature of his crime remains unclear. As punishment, Babi is handed over to Thoth, who executes him on a sacrificial block. This passage in the papyrus appears to justify the tradition of sacrificing a dog in Thoth’s honor.

Babi’s offense could have been rape, adultery, or simply excessive sexual indulgence. His partner is referred to as “mnt”, which translates to “someone”, suggesting that her identity is either irrelevant or deliberately concealed. In ancient Egyptian belief, written words held power, so crimes against deities—such as the murder of Osiris—were often described in euphemistic terms. A related inscription in the Temple of Edfu includes a spell to suppress Babi’s sexual virility with a goddess who is paradoxically referred to as both a “God’s Wife” and a woman who abstains from relationships with gods and men. The title “God’s Wife” was used for both priestesses and goddesses associated with the Eye of Ra. A similar mythological motif appears in the Mythological Manual of the Delta, where a goddess is bound and raped by Set while she isholding onto him to prevent his escape.

Another reference to Babi and dogs appears in the Papyrus Geneva. In a episode from Horus childhood, the goddess Isis warns her son Horus to stay away from Babi, who is roaming the land with 77 dogs. When Horus is bitten on the lower leg by one of Babi’s dogs, Isis instructs him to treat the wound with an unknown plant called Sryw, which had been stored in jars exposed to sunlight. The text seems to serve as a medical guide for dog bites, identifying the patient with Horus himself. The dog is then fed the plant, after which it dies, symbolizing the removal of the venom, while the patient is now able to recover.

<text>Legal separation (sometimes judicial separation, separate maintenance, divorce&#x27;, ordivorce from bed-and-board) is a legal process by which a married couple may formalize a separation while remaining legally married. A legal separation is granted in the form of a court order. In cases where children are involved, a court order of legal separation often makes child custody arrangements, specifying sole custody or shared parenting, as well as child support. Some couples obtain a legal separation as an alternative to a divorce, based on moral or religious objections to divorce.

Legal separation does not automatically lead to divorce. The couple might reconcile, in which case they do not have to do anything in order to continue their marriage.

== &quot;&quot; separation ==

 is a legal Latin phrase which means &quot;from table and bed&quot;, often translated as &quot;from bed and board&quot;, in which &quot;board&quot; is a word for &quot;table&quot;. Separation &quot;&quot; is essentially a separation that is sanctioned by a court order, meaning that the spouses may legally live apart, but they are still legally married. The legitimacy of any future child born to the couple remains intact, and the spouses may not legally remarry. This type of separation allows the couple to live apart without concerns about being taken to court for &quot;desertion&quot;. (In some jurisdictions, provable &quot;desertion&quot; is legal grounds for a divorce.)

There are several reasons why a couple might seek &#x27; separation. In some legal jurisdictions, including certain countries, it can be difficult to get a full and final divorce, but if the spouses are already separated &#x27; for an extended period of time (for example, three years), the court may decide to grant a full and final divorce. When the requirements of burden of proof for a divorce are difficult to meet, in most jurisdictions, an &quot; ruling assures the couple a slot in the court&#x27;s schedule whenever they file for a full divorce, by showing that they were both serious about their separation.

Sometimes, an &quot; separation is used when one partner is claimed to be emotionally, verbally, or physically abusive, keeping the marriage in existence while the two spouses are physically separated. This physical separation may give the two of them a chance to work out the problems in their relationship while residing in legally sanctioned separate dwellings. Spouses may also request an separation to protect themselves from accusations of desertion or abandonment—such as in cases where one must depart from the other for an extended period of time.

==In specific countries==

===Canada===

In most provinces of Canada, the terms &quot;legal separation&quot; or &quot;judicial separation&quot; are often used informally to describe a situation of separation where the couple has formalized certain agreements or entered into a contract. However, this situation is different from the specific legal &quot;status&quot; of legal/judicial separation that exists in some other jurisdictions and requires filing the courts for. As such, &quot;&quot; separation does not exist in most provinces of Canada, but the term &quot;legal separation&quot; has gained widespread use to describe a contract that is created between two spouses at the time of their separation. This contract is more properly referred to as a separation agreement, a legally binding written agreement voluntarily signed by two spouses (either married or common law) who have separated. 

However, the province of Saskatchewan does allow a legal separation under provincial law, which is distinct from a divorce under federal law. A legal separation in Saskatchewan can be granted by the Court of King&#x27;s Bench.

In Ontario, a separation agreement is unenforceable unless it is made in writing, signed by the parties and witnessed. This written agreement usually resolves all issues arising from the separation, including custody and access, child support, spousal support and the division of property, except only a court can grant a divorce itself.

===Ireland===
Before the introduction of the &quot;Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989&quot;, the only means of judicial separation available in the Republic of Ireland was to seek a decree of divorce . This could only be obtained on the grounds of adultery, cruelty, or &quot;unnatural practices&quot; (a concept never defined by the legislature or the courts). Post-1989 judicial separation is possible on one of six grounds, proven on the balance of probabilities:

# Respondent has committed adultery.
# Respondent has behaved in such a way that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to live with them (mental or physical cruelty).
# The respondent has deserted for a continuous period of at least one year immediately preceding the date of application.
# Both parties have lived apart for a continuous period of at least one year immediately preceding the date of application, and the respondent consents to the decree.
# Both parties have lived apart for a continuous period of at least three years immediately preceding the date of application.
# The marriage has broken down to the extent that the court is satisfied in all the circumstances that a normal marital relationship has not existed between the spouses for a period of at least one year immediately preceding the date of the application.

Of the six grounds, the latter forms the basis of the vast majority of judicial separation decrees. A &quot;normal marital relationship&quot; is not defined. The court must only be satisfied that there has been the loss of an &quot;essential ingredient of the marriage&quot;.

===United States===
In the United States of America, a legal separation may address the division of assets, division of debts, child custody, child support, and alimony. A separate maintenance agreement is not a legal separation and therefore child support and custody are typically not allowed to be addressed. A separate maintenance agreement is often confused with a legal separation which is filed with a court. Separate maintenance agreements are contracts between spouses and not approved by a court. They are similar to prenuptial agreements.

Under the law of some states, a separation can occur by judicial decree, or by an acknowledged (&quot;notarized&quot;) agreement of the parties. In some states, there must be grounds or a cause of action to get a judicial decree of separation, such as &quot;cruel and inhuman treatment ... abandonment ... neglect or refusal [to] support ... adultery by the defendant, [or] confinement of the defendant in prison ...&quot; Reconciliation is allowed. So, therefore, separation is revocable; state laws may require &quot;the joint application of the parties, accompanied with satisfactory evidence of their reconciliation ... by the court which rendered it, subject to such regulations and restrictions as the court thinks fit to impose.&quot;

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, a legal separation may only be had through a valid judicial decree. In addition, actions for legal separation shall not be tried &quot;before six months have elapsed since the filing of the petition.&quot; During this six-month &quot;cooling-off&quot; period, the spouses are encouraged to find forgiveness.

Under the Civil Code, there were only two grounds for legal separation:
# For adultery on the part of the wife and for concubinage on the part of the husband as defined in the Penal Code; or
# An attempt by one spouse against the life of the other.

The grounds were later expanded under Article 55 of the Family Code:
# Repeated physical violence or grossly abusive conduct directed against the petitioner, a common child, or a child of the petitioner;
# Physical violence or moral pressure to compel the petitioner to change religious or political affiliation;
# Attempt of respondent to corrupt or induce the petitioner, a common child, or a child of the petitioner, to engage in prostitution, or connivance in such corruption or inducement;
# Final judgment sentencing the respondent to imprisonment of more than six years, even if pardoned;
# Drug addiction or habitual alcoholism of the respondent;
# Lesbianism or homosexuality of the respondent;
# Contracting by the respondent of a subsequent bigamous marriage, whether in the Philippines or abroad;
# Sexual infidelity or perversion;
# Attempt by the respondent against the life of the petitioner; or
# Abandonment of petitioner by respondent without justifiable cause for more than one year.
(Note that the term &quot;child&quot; includes a child by nature or by adoption)

Article 63 of the Family Code enumerates the following concrete effects of a decree of legal separation:
# The spouses shall be entitled to live separately from each other, but the marriage bonds shall not be severed;
# The absolute community or the conjugal partnership shall be dissolved and liquidated but the offending spouse shall have no right to any share of the net profits earned by the absolute community or the conjugal partnership, which shall be forfeited in accordance with the provisions of Article 43(2);
# The custody of the minor children shall be awarded to the innocent spouse, subject to the provisions of Article 213 of this Code; and
# The offending spouse shall be disqualified from inheriting from the innocent spouse by intestate succession. Moreover, provisions in favor of the offending spouse made in the will of the innocent spouse shall be revoked by operation of law.
===Italy===
The law of Italy requires a period of legal separation (one year for contested separations, six months for consensual separations) before a decree of full and final divorce can be issued.

<doc id="98215" wikidata="Q5460279" url="?curid=98215" title="Flora Brovina">
<text>Flora Brovina (born 30 September 1949) is a Kosovar Albanian poet, pediatrician and women&#x27;s rights activist. She was born in the town of Skenderaj in the Drenica Valley of Kosovo, and was raised in Pristina, where she went to school and began studying medicine. After finishing her university studies in Zagreb, where she specialized in pediatrics, she returned to Kosovo and worked for a time as a journalist for the Albanian-language daily newspaper &quot;Rilindja&quot;. Soon thereafter, she returned to the health care profession and worked for many years in the Pediatrics Ward of the Pristina General Hospital.

==Kosovo war==
As the political situation in Kosovo deteriorated in the 1990s, and fighting broke out, Brovina ran a health clinic in Pristina in which she distributed health care information on matters as diverse as snake bites, dressing wounds and delivering babies. She also used the centre to shelter a number of orphaned children, many of whom had lost their parents during the fighting and expulsions. She and her fellow workers took care of as many as 25 children at a time.

On 20 April 1999 during the Kosovo War, Brovina was abducted by eight masked Serbia paramilitaries from the home she was staying in and was driven off by car to an initially unknown destination. She was thus in captivity in Serbia when NATO forces took Priština and Serb troops withdrew from the Kosovo province. The first news of her abduction broke on 24 April 1999 when her son managed to contact the international writers’ association, PEN, with an urgent appeal that the news of her abduction be made known as widely as possible. She was transferred to a Serb prison in Požarevac and, in her first month of detention, was subjected to over 200 hours of interrogation in 18 separate sessions lasting typically from 7 A.M. to 5 P.M. On 9 December 1999, in a show trial, she was accused of &#x27;terrorist activities&#x27; under Article 136 of the Yugoslav Penal Code. She spent a year and a half in Serb prisons before being released as a result of international pressure.

==Writing==
As a writer, Flora Brovina is the author of three volumes of lyric verse. The first collection, &quot;Verma emrin tim&quot; (Call me by my name), containing 42 verses, was published in Pristina in 1973 when she was a mere twenty-four years old. Six years later, in 1979, the collection &quot;Bimë e zë&quot; (Plant and voice) followed. It is in this collection that some of the main themes of Brovina&#x27;s poetry crystallize. Conspicuous among them is the fate of women in society, and in particular the role of women as mothers, as life-givers and nurturers. It is here that births, umbilical cords, amniotic fluid and suckling breasts begin to make their appearance. Along with plants, these are perhaps the most ubiquitous symbols of her verse production. Her third and last collection of original verse, entitled &quot;Mat e çmat&quot; (With the tape it measures), was published in Pristina in 1995. &quot;Mat e çmat&quot; appeared at a time when Kosovo was obviously gravitating towards war. Though this third collection cannot be interpreted as political verse to any great extent, there are many poems in the volume which reflect her preoccupation not only with the problems and aspirations of individuals, but also with the fate of her people, with freedom and self-determination.

In 1999, Flora Brovina was recipient of the annual Tucholsky Award of the Swedish PEN Club, a prize which has been awarded to other writers of note such as Salman Rushdie, Adam Zagajewski, Nuruddin Farah, Taslima Nasrin, Shirali Nurmuadov, and Vincent Magombe. She is also the recipient of the PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award by PEN American Center and the Human Rights Award of the Heinrich Böll Foundation in Berlin.

Despite this international recognition, as a poet, Flora Brovina has never been part of the literary establishment of Kosovo, nor has her verse found its way into the mainstream of contemporary Albanian literature. A collection of her verse has appeared in English in &quot;Flora Brovina, Call me by my Name, Poetry from Kosova&quot; in a bilingual Albanian-English Edition, translated by Robert Elsie, New York: Gjonlekaj 2001.

==Politics==
After Kosovo was proclaimed independent, Flora Brovina ran for the President of Kosovo in 2001 on the list of the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), a surprise candidate instead of the party&#x27;s leader Hashim Thaci. Since then, she has been a Member of the Assembly of Kosovo during each of its legislation period.

<doc id="98217" wikidata="Q361257" url="?curid=98217" title="Shel Silverstein">
<text>Sheldon Allan Silverstein (; September 25, 1930 – May 10, 1999) was an American writer, cartoonist, songwriter, and musician. Born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, Silverstein briefly attended university before being drafted into the United States Army. During his rise to prominence in the 1950s, his illustrations were published in various newspapers and magazines, including the adult-oriented &quot;Playboy&quot;. He also wrote a satirical, adult-oriented alphabet book, &quot;Uncle Shelby&#x27;s ABZ Book&quot;.

As a children&#x27;s author, some of his most acclaimed works include &quot;The Giving Tree&quot;, &quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot;, and &quot;A Light in the Attic&quot;. His works have been translated into more than 47 languages and have sold more than 20 million copies. As a songwriter, Silverstein wrote the 1969 Johnny Cash track &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot;, which peaked at number 2 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. His songs have been recorded and popularized by a wide range of other acts including Tompall Glaser, The Irish Rovers, Dr. Hook &amp; the Medicine Show and Marianne Faithfull. He was the recipient of two Grammy Awards as well as nominations at the Golden Globe Awards and Academy Awards.

His book &quot;A Light in the Attic&quot; is dedicated to his daughter who died at age 11. Silverstein died at home in Key West, Florida, of a heart attack on May 10, 1999, at age 68.

==Early life==
Sheldon Allan Silverstein was born in Chicago on September 25, 1930. His father, Nathan, was an immigrant from Eastern Europe of Jewish ancestry, and his mother, Helen, was born in Chicago. They ran a bakery which fared poorly, having been opened during the Great Depression. He grew up in the Logan Square neighborhood of Chicago, where he attended Theodore Roosevelt High School. He then attended the University of Illinois for one semester and was enrolled in the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts for one semester before being drafted into the U.S. Army; he served in Japan and Korea.

==Career==
===Cartoons===

Silverstein began drawing at age seven by tracing the works of Al Capp. He told &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;: &quot;When I was a kid—12 to 14, I&#x27;d much rather have been a good baseball player or a hit with the girls, but I couldn&#x27;t play ball. I couldn&#x27;t dance. Luckily, the girls didn&#x27;t want me. Not much I could do about that. So I started to draw and to write. I was also lucky that I didn&#x27;t have anybody to copy, be impressed by. I had developed my own style; I was creating before I knew there was a Thurber, a Benchley, a Price and a Steinberg. I never saw their work &#x27;til I was around 30. By the time I got to where I was attracting girls, I was already into work, and it was more important to me. Not that I wouldn&#x27;t rather make love, but the work has become a habit.&quot;

He was first published in the &quot;Roosevelt Torch,&quot; a student newspaper at Roosevelt University, where he studied English after leaving the Art Institute. During his time in the military, his cartoons were published in &quot;Pacific Stars and Stripes&quot;, where he had originally been assigned to do layouts and paste up. His first book &quot;Take Ten&quot;, a compilation of his military &quot;Take Ten&quot; cartoon series, was published by &quot;Pacific Stars and Stripes&quot; in 1955. He later said his time in college was a waste and would have been better spent traveling around the world meeting people.

After returning to Chicago, Silverstein began submitting cartoons to magazines while also selling hot dogs at Chicago ballparks. His cartoons began appearing in &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and &quot;This Week&quot;.

Mass-market paperback readers across America were introduced to Silverstein in 1956 when &quot;Take Ten&quot; was reprinted by Ballantine Books as &quot;Grab Your Socks!&quot;

In 1957, Silverstein became one of the leading cartoonists in &quot;Playboy&quot;, which sent him around the world to create an illustrated travel journal with reports from far-flung locales. During the 1950s and 1960s, he produced 23 installments called &quot;Shel Silverstein Visits...&quot; as a feature for &quot;Playboy&quot;. Employing a sketchbook format with typewriter-styled captions, he documented his own experiences at such locations as a New Jersey naturist community, the Chicago White Sox training camp, San Francisco&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury, Fire Island, Mexico, London, Paris, Spain and Africa. In a Swiss village, he drew himself complaining, &quot;I&#x27;ll give them 15 more minutes, and if nobody yodels, I&#x27;m going back to the hotel.&quot; These illustrated travel essays were collected by the publisher Fireside in &quot;Playboy&#x27;s Silverstein Around the World,&quot; published in 2007 with a foreword by Hugh Hefner and an introduction by music journalist Mitch Myers.

In a similar vein were his illustrations for John Sack&#x27;s &quot;Report from Practically Nowhere&quot; (1959), a collection of humorous travel vignettes previously appearing in &quot;Playboy&quot; and other magazines.

====&quot;Now here&#x27;s my plan...&quot;====
A cartoon he made during the 1950s was featured on the cover of his next cartoon collection, titled &quot;Now Here&#x27;s My Plan: A Book of Futilities&quot;, which was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1960. Silverstein biographer Lisa Rogak wrote:
The cartoon on the cover that provides the book&#x27;s title would turn out to be one of his most famous and often-cited cartoons. In the cartoon, two prisoners are chained to the wall of a prison cell. Both their hands and feet are shackled. One says to the other, &quot;Now here&#x27;s my plan.&quot; Silverstein was both fascinated and distressed by the amount of analysis and commentary that almost immediately began to swirl around the cartoon. &quot;A lot of people said it was a very pessimistic cartoon, which I don&#x27;t think it is at all,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of hope even in a hopeless situation. They analyze it and question it. I did this cartoon because I had an idea about a funny situation about two guys.&quot;
Silverstein&#x27;s cartoons appeared in issues of &quot;Playboy&quot; from 1957 through the mid-1970s, and one of his &quot;Playboy&quot; features was expanded into &quot;Uncle Shelby&#x27;s ABZ Book&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1961), his first book of new, original material for adults.

===Music===

Silverstein studied briefly at Chicago College of Performing Arts at Roosevelt University. Silverstein was associated with the outlaw country movement. His musical output included a large catalog of songs; a number of them were hits for other artists, such as the rock group Dr. Hook &amp; the Medicine Show. He wrote Tompall Glaser&#x27;s highest-charting solo single &quot;Put Another Log on the Fire&quot;, &quot;One&#x27;s on the Way&quot; and &quot;Hey Loretta&quot; (both hits for Loretta Lynn, in 1971 and 1973 respectively), and &quot;25 Minutes to Go&quot;, sung by Johnny Cash, about a man on death row with each line counting down one minute closer. Lynn recorded five songs written by Silverstein. Lynn&#x27;s producer Owen Bradley once said Silverstein&#x27;s style of song writing was the most similar to that of Lynn&#x27;s own writing. Silverstein also wrote one of Cash&#x27;s biggest hits, &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot;, as well as &quot;The Unicorn&quot;, first recorded by Silverstein in 1962 but better known in its version by The Irish Rovers. Other songs co-written by Silverstein include &quot;The Taker&quot; written with Kris Kristofferson and recorded by Waylon Jennings, and a sequel to &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot; titled &quot;Father of a Boy Named Sue&quot;, which is less known, but he performed the song on television on &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot;. He also penned a lesser known song titled &quot;Fuck &#x27;em.&quot;

He wrote the lyrics and music for most of the Dr. Hook &amp; the Medicine Show songs on their first few albums, including &quot;The Cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&quot;, &quot;Freaker&#x27;s Ball&quot;, &quot;Sylvia&#x27;s Mother&quot;, &quot;The Things I Didn&#x27;t Say&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Give a Dose to the One You Love Most&quot;. He wrote many of the songs performed by Bobby Bare, including &quot;Rosalie&#x27;s Good Eats Café&quot;, &quot;The Mermaid&quot;, &quot;The Winner&quot;, &quot;Daddy What If&quot;, &quot;Warm and Free&quot;, and &quot;Tequila Sheila&quot;. He co-wrote with Baxter Taylor &quot;Marie Laveau&quot;. The third album by Tompall Glaser contained eight songs by Silverstein and three by Silverstein and others.

Silverstein&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad of Lucy Jordan&quot;, first recorded by Dr. Hook in 1975, was re-recorded by Lee Hazlewood (1976), Marianne Faithfull (1979), Belinda Carlisle (1996), and Bobby Bare (2005) and later featured in the films &quot;Montenegro&quot; and &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;. &quot;Queen of the Silver Dollar&quot; was first recorded by Dr. Hook on their 1972 album &quot;Sloppy Seconds&quot;, and later by Doyle Holly (on his 1973 album &quot;Doyle Holly&quot;), Emmylou Harris (on her 1975 album &quot;Pieces of the Sky&quot;) and Dave &amp; Sugar (on their 1976 album &quot;Dave &amp; Sugar&quot;).

Silverstein composed original music for several films and displayed a musical versatility in these projects, playing guitar, piano, saxophone and trombone. He wrote &quot;In the Hills of Shiloh&quot;, a poignant song about the aftermath of the American Civil War, recorded by The New Christy Minstrels, Judy Collins, Bobby Bare, and others. The soundtrack of the 1970 film &quot;Ned Kelly&quot; features Silverstein songs performed by Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson, and others. He also co-wrote with Waylon the song &#x27;A Long Time Ago&#x27;.

In addition, Silverstein wrote &quot;Hey Nelly Nelly&quot;, a 1960s-era folk song recorded by Judy Collins.

Silverstein had a popular following on Dr. Demento&#x27;s radio show. Among his better-known comedy songs were &quot;Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout (Would Not Take the Garbage Out)&quot;, &quot;The Smoke-Off&quot; (a tale of a contest to determine who could roll—or smoke—marijuana joints faster), &quot;I Got Stoned and I Missed It&quot; and &quot;Stacy Brown Got Two.&quot; He wrote the 1962 song &quot;Boa Constrictor&quot;, sung by a person who is being swallowed by a snake. The latter song was recorded by the folk group Peter, Paul and Mary, and also by Johnny Cash for his 1966 album &quot;Everybody Loves a Nut&quot;.

One of Silverstein&#x27;s last musical projects was &quot;Old Dogs&quot;, a 1998 album with songs about getting old, all of which Silverstein wrote or co-wrote.

A longtime friend of singer-songwriter Pat Dailey, Silverstein collaborated with him on the posthumously released &quot;Underwater Land&quot; album (2002). It contains 17 children&#x27;s songs written and produced by Silverstein and sung by Dailey (with Silverstein joining him on a few tracks). The album features art by Silverstein.

He was a friend of Chicago songwriter Steve Goodman, for whom he wrote the final verse of &quot;What Have You Done For Me Lately?&quot; (refusing a songwriting credit for his contribution). 

In 2010, Bobby Bare and his son Bobby Bare Jr produced a CD called &quot;Twistable, Turnable Man: A Musical Tribute to the Songs of Shel Silverstein&quot; which was released on Sugar Hill Records. Other artists who recorded Silverstein&#x27;s songs include the Brothers Four, Andrew Bird, My Morning Jacket and Bobby Bare Jr.

===Theater===
In January 1959, &quot;Look, Charlie: A Short History of the Pratfall&quot; was a chaotic off-Broadway comedy staged by Silverstein, Jean Shepherd and Herb Gardner at New York&#x27;s Orpheum Theatre on Second Avenue in the Lower East Side. Silverstein went on to write more than 100 one-act plays. &quot;The Lady or the Tiger Show&quot; (1981) and &quot;Remember Crazy Zelda?&quot; (1984) were produced in New York.&quot; The Devil and Billy Markham&quot;, published in &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1979, was later adapted into a solo one-act play that debuted on a double bill with Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Bobby Gould in Hell&quot; (1989) with Dr. Hook vocalist Dennis Locorriere narrating. In 1990, Silverstein&#x27;s one-act modernized version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; starred Melvin Van Peebles playing all the roles. Karen Kohlhaas directed &quot;An Adult Evening of Shel Silverstein&quot;, produced by New York&#x27;s Atlantic Theater Company in September 2001 with a variety of short sketches:
*&quot;One Tennis Shoe&quot;—Harvey claims his wife is becoming a bag lady.
*&quot;Bus Stop&quot;—Irwin stands on a corner with a &quot;bus stop&quot; sign.
*&quot;Going Once&quot;—A woman auctions herself.
*&quot;The Best Daddy&quot;—Lisa&#x27;s daddy shot the &quot;pony&quot; he got for her birthday.
*&quot;The Lifeboat is Sinking&quot;—Jen and Sherwin, Husband and Wife, play a game of Who-Would-You-Save-If—the family was drowning.
*&quot;Smile&quot;—Bender plans to punish the man responsible for the phrase &quot;Have a nice day&quot;.
*&quot;Watch and Dry&quot;—Marianne discovers her laundry has not been cleaned.
*&quot;Thinking Up a New Name for the Act&quot;—Pete thinks &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; is the perfect name for a vaudeville act.
*&quot;Buy One, Get One Free&quot;—Hookers offer a golden opportunity.
*&quot;Blind Willie and the Talking Dog&quot;—Blind Willie&#x27;s talking dog argues they could profit from his talent.

A production of &quot;An Adult Evening of Shel Silverstein&quot; was produced by a Hofstra University theater group named The Spectrum Players, founded by Francis Ford Coppola in 1959. The production used a &quot;victorian sailors on shore leave watching a play&quot; aesthetic and used live rag-time and a character of an emcee not in the script to transition between pieces. The production was directed by Richard Traub of Chicago and starred several of Hofstra&#x27;s most promising young actors: Nick Pacifico, Amanda Mac, Mike Quattrone, Ross Greenberg, Chelsea Lando, Allie Rightmeyer, and Paolo Perez as the MC.

In December 2001, &quot;Shel&#x27;s Shorts&quot; was produced in repertory as two separate evenings under the titles &quot;Signs of Trouble&quot; and &quot;Shel Shocked&quot; by the Market Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. &quot;Signs of Trouble&quot; was directed by Wesley Savick, and &quot;Shel Shocked&quot; was directed by Larry Coen.

On November 29, 2022, a revival of Shel Silverstein&#x27;s &quot;Lafcadio: The Lion Who Shot Back&quot; opened at the Gishen Hall of the Niavaran Cultural Center in Tehran, Iran. The performance was reviewed in the Tehran Times on December 15, 2022. The review said &quot;But is a famous, successful, and admired lion a happy lion? Or is he a lion at all? Told and drawn with wit and gusto. Shel Silverstein&#x27;s modern fable speaks not only to children but to us all!&quot;

===TV and film===
Silverstein co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;Things Change&quot; with David Mamet. He also wrote several stories for the TV movie &quot;Free to Be... You and Me&quot;. Silverstein wrote and narrated an animated short of &quot;The Giving Tree&quot;, first produced in 1973; a remake based on Silverstein&#x27;s original screenplay but without his narration was released in 2015 by director Brian Brose. Other credits include the shorts &quot;De boom die gaf&quot; (based on his novel) and &quot;&quot;.

His songs have been used in many TV shows and movies, including &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (&quot;The Cover of Rolling Stone&quot;), &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; (&quot;The Ballad of Lucy Jordan&quot;), &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m Checkin&#x27; Out&quot;), and &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (&quot;One&#x27;s on the Way&quot;), as well as the Dustin Hoffman film &quot;Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?&quot; (&quot;Bunky and Lucille&quot;, &quot;Last Morning&quot;).

==Views on his own writing==
Ursula Nordstrom, Silverstein&#x27;s editor at Harper &amp; Row, encouraged Silverstein to write children&#x27;s poetry. Silverstein said that he had never studied the poetry of others and had therefore developed his own quirky style, laid back and conversational, occasionally employing profanity and slang. In an interview with &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; in 1975, he was asked how he came to do children&#x27;s books:

&quot;I didn&#x27;t,&quot; Shel said, &quot;I never planned to write or draw for kids. It was Tomi Ungerer, a friend of mine, who insisted—practically dragged me, kicking and screaming, into Ursula Nordstrom&#x27;s office. And she convinced me that Tomi was right; I could do children&#x27;s books.&quot; The relationship between Ursula Nordstrom and Shel Silverstein is mutually rewarding. He considers her a superb editor who knows when to leave an author-illustrator alone. Asked if he would change something he had produced on an editor&#x27;s say-so, he answered with a flat &quot;No.&quot; But he added: &quot;Oh, I will take a suggestion for revision. I do eliminate certain things when I&#x27;m writing for children if I think only an adult will get the idea. Then I drop it, or save it. But editors messing with content? No.&quot; Had he been surprised by the astronomical record of &quot;The Giving Tree&quot;, his biggest seller to date and one of the most successful children&#x27;s books in years? Another emphatic no. &quot;What I do is good,&quot; he said. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t let it out if I didn&#x27;t think it was.&quot; But &quot;The Giving Tree&quot;, which has been selling steadily since it appeared almost 10 years ago and has been translated into French, is not his own favorite among his books. &quot;I like &quot;Uncle Shelby&#x27;s ABZ&quot;, &quot;A Giraffe and a Half&quot;, and &quot;Lafcadio, the Lion Who Shot Back&quot;—I think I like that one the most.&quot;

Otto Penzler, in his crime anthology &quot;Murder for Revenge&quot; (1998), commented on Silverstein&#x27;s versatility:

This anthology was the second in a series, which also included &quot;Murder for Love&quot; (1996) and &quot;Murder and Obsession&quot; (1999). All three anthologies included Silverstein contributions. He did not really care to conform to any sort of norm, but he did want to leave his mark for others to be inspired by, as he told &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;:

I would hope that people, no matter what age, would find something to identify with in my books, pick up one and experience a personal sense of discovery. That&#x27;s great. I think that if you&#x27;re a creative person, you should just go about your business, do your work and not care about how it&#x27;s received. I never read reviews because if you believe the good ones you have to believe the bad ones too. Not that I don&#x27;t care about success. I do, but only because it lets me do what I want. I was always prepared for success but that means that I have to be prepared for failure too. I have an ego, I have ideas, I want to be articulate, to communicate but in my own way. People who say they create only for themselves and don&#x27;t care if they are published... I hate to hear talk like that. If it&#x27;s good, it&#x27;s too good not to share. That&#x27;s the way I feel about my work. So I&#x27;ll keep on communicating, but only my way. Lots of things I won&#x27;t do. I won&#x27;t go on television because who am I talking to? Johnny Carson? The camera? Twenty million people I can&#x27;t see? Uh-uh. And I won&#x27;t give any more interviews.

==Personal life==
From around 1967 to 1975, Silverstein lived on a houseboat in Sausalito, California. He also owned homes on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Massachusetts; Greenwich Village, New York; and Key West, Florida. He never married, and according to the 2007 biography &quot;A Boy Named Shel&quot;, had sex with &quot;hundreds, perhaps thousands of women&quot;. He was also a frequent presence at Hugh Hefner&#x27;s Playboy Mansion and Playboy Clubs.

Silverstein met a woman from Sausalito named Susan Taylor Hastings at the Playboy Mansion, and they had a daughter named Shoshanna Jordan Hastings (b. June 30, 1970). Susan died on June 29, 1975, one day before Shoshanna&#x27;s fifth birthday, and Shoshanna went to live with her uncle and aunt in Baltimore, Maryland. Shoshanna died of a cerebral aneurysm on April 24, 1982, at age 11. Silverstein&#x27;s 1981 book &quot;A Light in the Attic&quot; is dedicated to her. Silverstein later met Key West native Sarah Spencer, who drove a tourist train and inspired Silverstein&#x27;s song &quot;The Great Conch Train Robbery&quot;. They had a son named Matthew De Ver (b. November 10, 1984), who later became a New York City–based songwriter and producer.

==Death==
On May 10, 1999, Silverstein died at age 68 of a heart attack at home in Key West, Florida. He was buried at Westlawn Cemetery in Norridge, Illinois.

==Awards==
Silverstein&#x27;s song &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot; won a 1970 Grammy. He was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for his song &quot;I&#x27;m Checkin&#x27; Out&quot; from the film &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot;.

Together with longtime friend and producer Ron Haffkine, Silverstein released &quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot; on cassette in 1983, and as an LP phonograph record in 1984, winning the 1984 Grammy Award for Best Recording For Children.

Silverstein was posthumously inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2002. Silverstein was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame in 2014.

Silverstein believed that written works needed to be read on paper, with specific paper for the particular work. He usually would not allow his poems and stories to be published unless he could choose the type, size, shape, color, and quality of the paper. Being a book collector, he took seriously the feel of the paper, the look of the book, the fonts, and the binding. Most of his books did not have paperback editions because he did not want his work to be diminished in any way. Silverstein&#x27;s estate continues to control copyright permissions on his work and has blocked the quotations of that work in at least one biographical treatment.

<text>The Château du Clos Lucé (; or simply Clos Lucé), formerly called Manoir du Cloux, is a large château located in the center of Amboise, in the department of Indre-et-Loire, in the Centre-Val de Loire region of France. It is located in the natural Val de Loire (formerly called Touraine) region. Built by Hugues d&#x27;Amboise in 1471, the palace has known several famous owners such as the French king Charles VIII and Leonardo da Vinci. Clos Lucé is 500 metres from the royal Château d&#x27;Amboise, to which it is connected by an underground passageway.

King Charles VIII bought the home from Étienne Le Loup in 1490 and during this time it became known as the ‘summer house’, housing French royalty. After a few decades Francis I gave it to Leonardo da Vinci when he invited him to live in France in 1516. The ageing polymath lived his last years in this house until his death on 2 May 1519.

&quot;The Death of Leonardo da Vinci&quot;, an 1818 oil painting by the French artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, depicts Leonardo da Vinci on his deathbed at Clos Lucé on May 2, 1519 with Francis I of France holding his head. Another version of the painting created is held by the Smith College Museum of Art.

Thanks to its famous owners, this house today ranks as an ‘historic monument’ and therefore is protected from demolition or reconstruction. After 1855 it became a well-known museum about Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s life, work and memory, which was put together and directed by The Saint-Bris family, the current owners of the property.

== History ==

=== The Middle-Ages and the Renaissance period ===
The house was built by Hugues d&#x27;Amboise on a Gallo-Roman foundation. It was organized around an octagonal tower, within which a spiral staircase stood. Around the spiral staircase were two buildings that had two floors each. The elegant facade made with pink bricks and whites stones was typical of the 15th century. Formally called Château de Cloux, the building was property of the Chateau D’Amboise, and the lands of Lucé were annexed to the castle from the 14th century. At the time, the manor was surrounded by fortifications; only one still remains, the watchtower.

For a short time the building housed religious people of the abbaye of Moncé, as they resided in the building until 1471. The Clos Lucé was then sold on 26 May to Etienne le Loup, who was Louis XI Counselor and Amboise beadle. The building was in ruin when Etienne acquired the lands, he restored it giving it the famous visual aspect that we see today - a square tower with Gothic windows that created a towering and well protected medieval fortress.

====Ownership by royalty====

On the 2 July 1490, Charles VIII bought the castle from Etienne Le Loup for 3500 golden ecus and transformed the medieval stronghold into a more comfortable and habitable home. He also built a chapel for his wife, Anne of Brittany who lived at the Clos-Lucé until she left for the royal castle of Blois. It became known as ‘the summer house’ for the French royalty for 200 years.

The oratory was a chapel of the Gothic movement made with chalk stones (tuffeau) and decorated with murals painted by Leonardo&#x27;s disciples: there is an &quot;Annunciation&quot;, a &quot;Last Judgement&quot; and a final painting called &quot;Virgo Lucis&quot; above the door, which may have gave its name to the castle. The museum also includes a copy of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, painted in 1654 by Ambroise Dubois.

Between 1509 and 1515 the Castle housed Charles IV Duke of Alençon and Marguerite of Valois. The duke then sold the castle to Louise of Savoy, Regent of France, who took up residence and raised her two children the Duke of Angoulême who was destined to become the next king of France, Francis I and Marguerite de Navarre, intellectual and writer of the &quot;Heptaméron&quot;.

=== Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s years at the Clos Lucé ===

In 1516, aged 64, Leonardo da Vinci left Rome and traveled through Italy, armed with his sketchbooks and three of his most famous paintings: &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, &quot;The Virgin and Child&quot;, &quot;with St. Anne&quot; and &quot;St. John the Baptist&quot;. They are now conserved in the Musée du Louvre, Paris. His disciples Francesco Melzi and Salaì followed him throughout his travels, as did his servant, Batista of Vilanis.

Benvenuto Cellini wrote that King Francis I gave Leonardo da Vinci a pension of 700 gold ecus, as well as buying his artwork, allowing him to live and work in the Clos Lucé. Leonardo da Vinci was appointed ‘The first painter, engineer and architect of the King’. Leonardo da Vinci was enthusiastic and productive during his years at the Clos Lucé. He worked on numerous projects, organized feasts for the court of Amboise, and even drew the famous “Double Spiral Staircase” of the Château de Chambord. He also spent time on other projects, one of them consisting of designing the perfect city of Romorantin. In this, Leonardo da Vinci wanted to dig a canal to connect two rivers allowing easier trade. He is still considered as one of the most renowned artists of his time.

On October 10, 1517, he was visited by the Cardinal Luigi d’Aragona, who was so impressed by his works of art that he described them in his &quot;Itinerario&quot; as “rare perfection”. These include some of his most famous pieces of work: the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; and &quot;The Virgin and Child with St. Anne&quot; and &quot;St John the Baptist&quot;.

Leonardo organized a feast in the Château du Clos Lucé on June 19, 1518, to thank The French King Francis I for his multiple gifts and generosity. There were a lot of similarities with the feast that Leonardo organised in Milan on January 13, 1490 (&quot;Festa del paradisio&quot;, play of Bernardo Bellincioni): there was complex machinery to impress the guests, which referred to the movements of the celestial bodies thanks to a blue canvas which symbolized the heavens where ran planets, stars, the Sun, the Moon and the twelve zodiac signs.

Despite the rumors that he would die in the king&#x27;s arms, Leonardo da Vinci passed away in his room at the Clos Lucé on May 2, 1519. He left his books, drawings, sketches and manuscripts to his beloved apprentice, Francesco Melzi.

=== From the Renaissance to Modern times ===
After Leonardo&#x27;s death, Louise of Savoy took over the Chateau, however this did not last too long as Philibert Babou of the Bourdaisière and his wife succeeded her in 1523. The Chateau was then taken over by Michel of Gast, who was the Guards Captain under King Henri III of France and became the owner after the murder of the Cardinal of Guise by the king himself, in 1583.

In 1632, the marriage of Antoine d’Amboise and Michel de Gast&#x27;s granddaughter brought the Chateau back in the hands of House Amboise. During the French Revolution the castle was miraculously spared and remained in the Amboise family until 1832 - it was then designed as a historical monument by the list of 1862.

Finally, the castle became the property of the Saint-Bris family on 30 July 1855, after ownership by the Amboise family who protected the property, by then, named Clos Lucé instead of Manoir du Cloux, during the French Revolution. The chateau was opened to the public in 1954 by Hubert and Agnès Saint Bris. A major restoration was completed in the 1960s. In 1979, Jean Saint Bris continued his parents&#x27; work. As of 2019, president of the family enterprise was François Saint Bris.

=== The castle today ===

The castle is set in the heart of a 7-hectares park, crossed by the &quot;Amasse&quot;, a tributary of the Loire. The facade of the house is made with pink bricks and white stones and has remained almost unaltered since the Renaissance in which an old rampart walkway still remains. Within the castle, remain the rooms of Leonardo da Vinci, Anne of Brittany and Marguerite of Navarre, including the oratory and council rooms. The first floor bedrooms were restored in 2011 with period details and artifacts. There is a restaurant on site.

According to the Smithsonian, restoration over the years was extensive: &quot;the mansion has been restored to the way it appeared during Leonardo&#x27;s stay there, including his bedroom, his basement studio, the original frescoes on the walls and the high stone hearth in the kitchen&quot;.

In the basement, there are 40 models that IBM made from Leonardo&#x27;s sketches and drawings, including a helicopter, as well as some 3D animations about the Italian master&#x27;s inventions, allowing the public to see them working. In the park is a pigeon house from the middle of 15th century built by Etienne le Loup, Amboise beadle that can shelter up to a thousand birds. In 2003, Jean Saint-Bris set up an educational and cultural course in the park of the Clos Lucé with several sound terminals and impressive machines inspired from Leonardo&#x27;s mind. The open-air museum in the garden, with its forty translucent canvasses, houses full-size models of some Da Vinci inventions, including a chariot, a multi-barrelled gun, an aerial screw and a revolving bridge.

During 2019, the 500th anniversary of his death, Amboise held many events celebrating Da Vinci&#x27;s life, some at Clos Lucé. The number of visitors to the chateau in 2019 was estimated as 500,000, a 30% increase over the typical annual number. Da Vinci is special to the French, according to François Saint Bris. &quot;He lived a long time in France and he died here ... And &#x27;La Joconde&#x27; [Mona Lisa] is in France. So ... for us, he&#x27;s a little French.&quot;

<doc id="98220" wikidata="Q2082582" url="?curid=98220" title="Anytus">
<text>Anytus (; ; probably before 451 – after 388 BCE), son of Anthemion of the deme Euonymon, was a politician in Classical Athens. Anytus served as a general in the Peloponnesian War of 431 to 404 BCE, and later became a leading supporter of the democratic forces opposed to the Thirty Tyrants who ruled Athens from 404 to 403 BCE. He is best remembered as one of the prosecutors of the philosopher Socrates in 399 BCE; probably because of that role, Plato depicted Anytus as an interlocutor in the dialogue &quot;Meno&quot;.

== Ancestry ==
Anytus appears to have been one of the &quot;nouveaux riche&quot; of Athens, that is, of the commercial class and not one of the landed aristocracy that had ruled the city since time immemorial.  His father is believed to be the Anthemion, son of Diphilus, that dedicated a statue on the Acropolis in thanks for his rise to class of “knight”.  The Aristotelian &quot;Athenaion Politeia&quot; had this attribution:In the Acropolis there is a votive offering, a statue of Diphilus, bearing this inscription:  

“Anthemion, the son of Diphilos, has dedicated this statue to the Gods, when from the status of a Thetis he had been raised to the status of a Knight.”

And a horse stands in evidence beside the man, implying that this was what was meant by belonging to the rank of Knight.Though this connection for Anytus is not certain, most modern historians accept it based on Socrates’ comment in Plato’s &quot;Meno&quot; to the effect that Anytus was:the son of Anthemion, a man of property and good sense, who didn’t get his money out of the blue or as a gift… but earned it by his own brains and hard work.The family wealth was generated by Anthemion’s tannery and shoemaking businesses.  Anytus inherited and continued to manage these.

== Career ==
Little is known of Anytus’ activities during his adult years – just a few incidents in which he was involved.

He was appointed to the post of general (&quot;strategos&quot;) in late years of the Peloponnesian War.  In 409/8 BC, he was assigned the task of taking a fleet of ships to defend the outpost of Pylos in the western Peloponnese.  Athens had captured this rocky crag in 425 BC and staffed it with runaway &quot;helots&quot; who harassed the Spartans in the region in the following years. In the spring and summer of 409 BC, it was under attack by the Spartans, and the Athenians sought to bolster its defenses with the force led by Anytus.  He failed to complete the mission because storms at sea prevented his sailing around the southern reaches of the Peloponnese.  When he returned to Athens he was prosecuted for treason, something frequently done to generals who failed to complete the tasks assigned to them. In this case, he was acquitted on the charge, allegedly because he bribed the jury – the first person to have done so.  (This was not easy to do, given that Athenian juries numbered between 200 and 2,000 men.)

=== Relationship with Alcibiades ===
Anytus was reportedly a lover of the young Alcibiades, former ward of Pericles, profligate playboy, and (later) general at Athens. Both Plutarch and Athenaeus described an incident where Anytus was hosting a dinner party during which Alcibiades rudely commandeered half the gold and silver cups at the table and presented them as a gift to Thrasyllus, another of the evening’s guests who was quite poor. When their companions expressed indignation at Alcibiades’ effrontery, Anytus responded that his beloved had not been inconsiderate, but just the opposite, since he had the power to take everything and yet left half behind.

=== Tyranny of the Thirty ===
After the battle of Aigospotami in 405 BC, in which the Athenian fleet was destroyed, the city was besieged by the Spartans and eventually capitulated. The Spartans demanded that the city take down its walls, recall its exiles (oligarchic sympathizers all), and restore the ancient government – i.e., dismantle its democracy. At their “suggestion”, a ruling body of thirty governors was selected, mimicking Sparta’s own ruling board of thirty, the &quot;gerousia&quot;.

At this time many of those opposed to this coup abandoned the city and took refuge in such places as Thebes and Argos. The leader of these democratic partisans was Thrasybulus, and Anytus was among his lieutenants. Lysias, in one of his forensic orations, related an incident where one Agoratus, who had cooperated with the Thirty at first, later tried to join the exiles at Phyle, a fortress in northern Attica where they were organizing a counter coup. As soon as they saw him they laid hold of him [Agoratus] and dragged him straight away to be killed in the place where they executed ordinary pirates or robbers that fell into their hands. Anytus, who was the general, said that they ought not to do that, on the ground that they were not yet in a position to punish certain of their enemies; at that moment they should rather keep quiet. If ever they returned home, they would then proceed to punish the guilty.The counter coup was ultimately successful and democracy restored at Athens. One of the means implemented to reconcile the warring parties was a general amnesty, which was resented by many who had lost loved ones and property during the carnage perpetrated by the Thirty. They chafed under the proscription of suing those who had wronged them and occasionally tried to seek recompense in the courts in spite of the law forbidding it. Isocrates wrote the defense speech in one such case and pointed out that certain wealthy and influential men and foregone such suits, even though they had the political pull to succeed in such efforts when ordinary men might fail. He specifically named Thrasyboulus and Anytus as:men of greatest influence in the city, although they have been robbed of large sums of money and know who gave in lists of their goods, nevertheless are not so brazen as to bring suit against them or to bring up old grudges against them; on the contrary, even if, in respect to all other claims, they have greater power than others to accomplish their ends, yet in matters covered by the covenant at least they see fit to put themselves on terms of equality with the other citizens.

== Trial of Socrates ==
In 399 BC, Anytus joined Meletus and Lycon in bringing an indictment against Socrates. We have two statements that purport to quote the specific charges, one from Plato and another from Diogenes Laertius. In his &quot;Apology&quot;, Plato had Socrates read out the complaint:
Socrates is guilty of criminal meddling in that he inquires into things below the earth and in the sky, and makes the weaker argument defeat the stronger, and teaches others to follow his example.
Diogenes, on the other hand, wrote:
The affidavit in the case, which is still preserved, says Favorinus, in the , ran as follows: “This indictment and affidavit is sworn by Meletus, the son of Meletus of Pitthos, against Socrates, the son of Sophroniscus of Alopece: Socrates is guilty of refusing to recognize the gods recognized by the state, and of introducing other new divinities. He is also guilty of corrupting the youth. The penalty demanded is death.”The discrepancies between these accounts have generated much discussion among modern scholars. So too the fact that neither accuses Socrates of any particular act. He seems to have been charged with just being Socrates. As such, the motivation of his accusers has been an issue for modern scholars. Foremost among the explanations proffered was Athens’ recent experience with overthrows and attempted overthrows of its democracy: the coup of the Four Hundred in 411, that of the Thirty in 404, and the attempted reimposition of that oligarchy in 401 by the remnants of the Thirty living at Eleusis. The prejudice against Socrates was not so much about his religious beliefs as about his impact on Athenian politics – namely that he was well known for favoring Spartan society over Athenian and that among the leaders of the coups were men who had spent considerable time with him in their youth. Among the most prominent of these were Theramenes, Critias, and Charmides. As a latter-day democrat, and one who had fought against the Thirty at Phyle and Peiraieus, Anytus would certainly have supported any effort to get rid of persons who directly or indirectly were responsible for these violent attacks on Athens’ government. But in Socrates’ case, he may have had more personal motives. Both Plato and Xenophon related events where enmity between the two men was on display. In &quot;Meno&quot; Plato constructed a conversation between them where Socrates was exploring the inability of the great men of Athens to pass on their excellence to their sons. Themistocles, Aristeides, Pericles, and Thucydides (son of Melesias, not the historian) were his examples – men whom one would think would have included ethical education among those subjects taught to them. Since they did not, Socrates reluctantly drew the inference that virtue could not be taught. Anytus, however, drew the inference that Socrates was criticizing them (and himself, presumably) for not making the effort.Socrates, I consider you are too apt to speak ill of people. I, for one, if you will take my advice, would warn you to be careful: in most cities it is probably easier to do people harm than good, and particularly in this one; I think you know that yourself.Antyus left the conversation at this point, and Socrates said to Meno:Meno, I think Anytus is angry, and I am not at all surprised: for he conceives, in the first place, that I am speaking ill of these gentlemen; and in the second place, he considers he is one of them himself.Xenophon provided the background for Anytus’ sensitivity on this issue.It is said also that [Socrates] remarked as he saw Anytus passing by: “There goes a man who is filled with pride at the thought that he has accomplished some great and noble end in putting me to death, because, seeing him honored by the state with the highest offices, I said that he ought not to confine his son&#x27;s education to hides [i.e., the tanning business]…

“At one time I had a brief association with the son of Anytus, and I thought him not lacking in firmness of spirit; and so I predict that he will not continue in the servile occupation that his father has provided for him; but through want of a worthy adviser he will fall into some disgraceful propensity and will surely go far in the career of vice.”

In saying this he was not mistaken; the young man, delighting in wine, never left off drinking night or day, and at last turned out worth nothing to his city, his friends, or himself.Xenophon was not in Athens at this time; he was in Asia on a military campaign, so this is hearsay and probably not a verbatim quote. But it accords with the general pattern of Socrates enthralling the youth of Athens by embarrassing its leading citizens when they failed to satisfactorily answer his probing questions about virtue and wisdom. In this case, it is likely that Anytus lost the affection and respect of his son and blamed Socrates for it – in his eyes, probably sufficient reason to join in his prosecution. The scholiast to Plato’s &quot;Apology&quot; (18b), cited in note 3 above, provided some additional background:[Anytus] was rich from his tanning business, for which he was mocked by Socrates. Because of this mockery Anytus persuaded Meletus by bribing him to bring a charge of impiety against Socrates.Adding all this up, it seems Anytus had both political and personal reasons for wanting Socrates out of the way. As for Meletus’ and Lycon’s motives, we have only what Socrates said about the former in Plato’s &quot;Euthyphro&quot;:I am not too clear about the man myself, Euthyphro. He appears to me to be a young man, and unknown. I think however, thet they call him Meletus, and his deme is Pitthos, if you happen to know anyone named Meletus of that deme – a hook-nosed man with long, straight hair, and not much beard… He says, in fact, that he knows the method by which young people are corrupted, and knows who the persons are that do it… And so Meletus no doubt begins by clearing us away, the ones who ruin, as he says, the tender shoots of the young... With such a notable beginning, his chances of success look good.If the scholiast is correct, Meletus’ desire to keep the young from corruption was aided by a little corruptive bribery by Anytus. His “chances of success” were, in the end, in some doubt. In the aftermath of Socrates’ conviction and execution, there are stories of the remorse felt by the citizens of Athens and the punishments they meted out on his accusers. Diogenes Laërtius said:So [Socrates] was taken from among men; and not long afterwards the Athenians felt such remorse that they shut up the training grounds and gymnasia. They banished the other accusers, but put Meletus to death; they honoured Socrates with a bronze statue, the work of Lysippus, which they placed in the hall of processions. And no sooner did Anytus visit Heraclea than the people of that town expelled him on that very day.In another place, Diogenes credited Antisthenes, the cynic philosopher and former protégé of Socrates, with initiating these reprisals. The 4th century CE orator Themistius went so far as to claim that the people of Heraclea, rather than expel Anytus, stoned him to death on arrival.

These vignettes may simply be the inventions of later apologists for Socrates, for there is evidence that Anytus remained in Athens for some years. The &quot;Hellenica Oxyrhinchia&quot; places him at a meeting of the Athenian Assembly (&quot;Ecclesia&quot;) in 397/6 BC and Lysias, in one of his forensic orations, has the speaker call Anytus, who was serving as grain inspector at the time, as a witness in a trial that took place in 388 BC. Both of these events were long after any retribution for his prosecution of Socrates would have been meted out. Furthermore, in 336/5 BC, two men, Anytus (II) and Anthemion (II), of the same deme as our subject, served on the Athenian Council of 500 (&quot;Boule&quot;). This Anytus also served as &quot;trierarch&quot;in 323/2 BC. If they were, indeed descendants, it would argue against Anytus I having been forcibly exiled, as his son (and any other issue) would have lost citizenship rights in the process.

== Legacy ==
Anytus made somewhat mixed contributions to the Athens of his time.  He failed at the one military command we know of and bribed his way out of taking responsibility for it – though to be fair, the punishment he faced was unduly severe.  He played a significant role in restoring both the democracy and the rule of law after the tyranny of the Thirty and went on to hold positions of responsibility in that democracy in later years.  Finally, he appears to have done a poor job of raising his son, and, rather than take responsibility for that, placed the blame for how the lad turned out on a man who did little more than ask people to question their assumptions about life. For all his contributions to Athenian society, both positive and negative, his lasting legacy is to have prosecuted on trumped up charges one of the most admired men in world history.

<text>The United States Marshals Service (USMS) is a federal law enforcement agency in the United States. The Marshals Service serves as the enforcement and security arm of the U.S. federal judiciary, and it is an agency of the U.S. Department of Justice and operates under the direction of the U.S. attorney general. U.S. Marshals are the original U.S. federal law enforcement officers, created by the Judiciary Act of 1789 during the presidency of George Washington as the &quot;Office of the United States Marshal&quot; under the U.S. District Courts. The USMS was established in 1969 to provide guidance and assistance to U.S. Marshals throughout the federal judicial districts.

The Marshals Service is primarily responsible for locating and arresting federal suspects, the administration of fugitive operations, the management of criminal assets, the operation of the United States Federal Witness Protection Program and the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System, the protection of federal courthouses and judicial personnel, and the protection of senior government officials through the Office of Protective Operations. Throughout its history the Marshals have also provided unique security and enforcement services including protecting African American students enrolling in the South during the civil rights movement, escort security for United States Air Force LGM-30 Minuteman missile convoys, law enforcement for the United States Antarctic Program, and protection of the Strategic National Stockpile.

==History==

===Origins===
The office of United States Marshal was created by the First Congress. President George Washington signed the Judiciary Act into law on September 24, 1789. The Act provided that a United States Marshal&#x27;s primary function was to execute all lawful warrants issued to him under the authority of the United States. The law defined marshals as officers of the courts charged with assisting federal courts in their law-enforcement functions:

Six days after signing the act into law, President Washington appointed the first thirteen U.S. Marshals, for each of the then extant federal districts. To each of his appointees for Marshal and District Attorney, the president addressed a form letter:

The critical Supreme Court decision affirming the legal authority of the federal marshals was made in .

For over 100 years marshals were patronage jobs, typically controlled by the district judge. They were paid primarily by fees until a salary system was set up in 1896. Many of the first U.S. Marshals had already proven themselves in military service during the American Revolutionary War. Among the first marshals were John Adams&#x27;s son-in-law Congressman William Stephens Smith for the District of New York, another New York district marshal, Congressman Thomas Morris, and Henry Dearborn for the District of Maine.

From the nation&#x27;s earliest days, marshals were permitted to recruit special deputies as local hires, or as temporary transfers to the Marshals Service from other federal law-enforcement agencies. Marshals were also authorized to swear in a posse to assist with manhunts, and other duties, ad hoc. Marshals were given extensive authority to support the federal courts within their judicial districts, and to carry out all lawful orders issued by federal judges, Congress, or the President. Federal marshals were by far the most important government officials in territorial jurisdictions. Local law enforcement officials were often called &quot;marshals&quot; so there is often an ambiguity whether someone was a federal or a local official.

Federal marshals are most famous for their law enforcement work, but that was only a minor part of their workload. The largest part of the business was paper work—serving writs (e.g., subpoenas, summonses, warrants), and other processes issued by the courts, making arrests and handling all federal prisoners. They also disbursed funds as ordered by the courts. Marshals paid the fees and expenses of the court clerks, U.S. Attorneys, jurors, and witnesses. They rented the courtrooms and jail space, and hired the bailiffs, criers, and janitors. They made sure the prisoners were present, the jurors were available, and that the witnesses were on time. The marshals thus provided local representation for the federal government within their districts. They took the national census every decade through 1870. They distributed presidential proclamations, collected a variety of statistical information on commerce and manufacturing, supplied the names of government employees for the national register, and performed other routine tasks needed for the central government to function effectively.

===19th century===
During the settlement of the American frontier, marshals served as the main source of day-to-day law enforcement in areas that had no local government of their own. U.S. Marshals were instrumental in keeping law and order in the &quot;Old West&quot; era. They were involved in apprehending desperadoes such as Bill Doolin, Ned Christie, and in 1893, the infamous Dalton Gang after a shoot-out that left dead Deputy Marshals Ham Hueston and Lafe Shadley, and posse member Dick Speed. Individual deputy marshals have been seen as legendary heroes in the face of rampant lawlessness (see Notable marshals below) with Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Dallas Stoudenmire, and Bass Reeves as examples of well-known marshals. Bill Tilghman, Heck Thomas, and Chris Madsen formed a legendary law enforcement trio known as &quot;Three Guardsmen&quot; when they worked together policing the vast, lawless Oklahoma and Indian Territories.

Until its repeal in 1864, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 tasked marshals to accept an affidavit on its face to recover a fugitive slave.

On October 26, 1881, Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp, his brothers, Special Deputy U.S. Marshals Morgan and Wyatt Earp, and Special Deputy U.S. Marshal John &quot;Doc&quot; H. Holliday gunned down Frank and Tom McLaury and Billy Clanton in the legendary gunfight at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona. In 1894, U.S. Marshals helped suppress the Pullman Strike.

====Marshals of the Consular Court====
During the 19th century, the United States government appointed marshals to be attached to the courts of American consulates in China, the Ottoman Empire, and Siam. The duties of these marshals included settling shipboard disputes and mutinies aboard American vessels, the apprehension of runaway sailors and American crews engaged in the illegal slave trade, adjusting claims for damages caused by American sailors to natives, and the rescue of natives kidnapped for slavery by Americans.

===20th century===
During the 1920s, U.S. Marshals enforced Prohibition. Marshals registered enemy aliens in wartime, sealed the American border against armed expeditions from foreign countries, and at times during the Cold War also swapped spies with the Soviet Union.

In the 1960s the marshals were on the front lines of the civil rights movement, mainly providing protection to volunteers. In September 1962, President John F. Kennedy ordered 127 marshals to accompany James Meredith, an African American who wished to register at the segregated University of Mississippi. Their presence on campus provoked riots at the university, but the marshals stood their ground, and Meredith registered. Marshals provided continuous protection to Meredith during his first year at Ole Miss, and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy later proudly displayed a deputy marshal&#x27;s dented helmet in his office. U.S. Marshals also protected black school children integrating public schools in the South. Artist Norman Rockwell&#x27;s famous painting &quot;The Problem We All Live With&quot; depicted a tiny Ruby Bridges being escorted by four towering United States Marshals in 1964.

Until 1965, each U.S. district court hired and administered its own marshals independently from all others. In 1965, the Executive Office for U.S. Marshals, was created as &quot;the first organization to supervise U.S. Marshals nationwide&quot;. The United States Marshals Service, a federal agency, was created in 1969. Since June 1975, the Marshals Service has the mission of providing law enforcement support and escort security to United States Air Force LGM-30 Minuteman and missile systems from military facilities.

In 1985, the Marshals Service partnered with local Washington, D.C. law enforcement officers to create Operation Flagship, arresting fugitives by using faked free tickets to a local American football game as a lure. In 1989, the Marshals Service was given jurisdiction over crimes committed relating to U.S. personnel in Antarctica. During the 1992 Los Angeles riots, 200 deputy marshals of the tactical unit Special Operations Group were dispatched to assist local and state authorities in restoring peace and order throughout Los Angeles County, California. In the 1990s, deputy marshals protected abortion clinics.

===21st century===
Marshals have protected American athletes at Olympic Games, the refugee boy Elián González before his return to Cuba in 2000, and abortion clinics as required by federal law. In 2003, Marshals retrieved North Carolina&#x27;s copy of the Bill of Rights.

In 2002, the Marshals Service was tasked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to provide protective security and law enforcement capabilities in the protection of the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), such as warehouses, materiel and CDC personnel during deployment. Marshals also provide secure transportation of critical medical supplies and bio-terrorism response resources throughout the nation. Senior Inspectors of the U.S. Marshals Service SNS Security Operations (SNSSO) Program have deployed to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and responded during the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009. SNSSO Senior Inspectors have also staffed National Security Special Events (NSSE) with their state, local and other federal partners on a regular basis.

In 2006, the Sex Offenders Investigations Branch (SOIB) was formed on July 27 with the passage of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (AWA). The SOIB carries out the USMS&#x27;s three principal responsibilities under the AWA: assist state, local, tribal and territorial authorities in the location and apprehension of non-compliant and fugitive sex offenders; investigate violations of the act for federal prosecution, and assist in the identification and location of sex offenders relocated as a result of a major disaster. To ensure the safety of communities and children across the country, the USMS has implemented an aggressive enforcement strategy for its responsibilities under the AWA. This branch apprehends sex offenders, primarily those who prey on minors. Offenders are apprehended due to failure to register, among other things.

In February 2017, Marshals began providing protective security to United States Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, the first time since 2009 that a United States Cabinet-level official has been provided security by the Marshals. Marshals were deployed to keep order in Washington, D.C. during the George Floyd protests on May 31, 2020, as well as during the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

On April 29, 2024, in Charlotte, North Carolina, one Marshal, two Department of Adult Corrections officers, and one local police officer on a task force were killed serving a warrant on a man for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Four Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department officers were wounded.

==Duties and responsibilities==
The Marshals Service is responsible for apprehending wanted fugitives, providing protection for the federal judiciary, transporting federal prisoners, protecting endangered federal witnesses, and managing assets seized from criminal enterprises. The Marshals Service is responsible for 55.2% of arrests of federal fugitives. Between 1981 and 1985, the Marshals Service conducted Fugitive Investigative Strike Team operations to jump-start fugitive capture in specific districts. In 2012, U.S. marshals captured over 36,000 federal fugitives and cleared over 39,000 fugitive warrants.

The Marshals Service also executes all lawful writs, processes, and orders issued under the authority of the United States, and can command all necessary assistance to execute its duties.

Historically, under Section 27 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 U.S. Marshals had the common law-based power to enlist any willing civilians as deputies for necessary assistance in the execution of their duties. In the Old West this was known as forming a posse, although under the Posse Comitatus Act, they could not use military troops in uniform representing their unit or the military service for law enforcement duties. However, if a service member was off duty, wearing civilian clothing, and willing to assist a law enforcement officer on their own behalf, it was acceptable. In contemporary times, the deputation of a civilian would be extraordinarily unusual. However, the Director of the United States Marshals Service currently has the statutory authority to deputize (for one year) selected officers of the United States Department of Justice; federal, state, or local law enforcement officers; employees of private security companies to provide courtroom security for the Federal judiciary; or other persons as designated by the United States Associate Attorney General.

Title 28 USC Chapter 37 § 564 authorizes United States Marshals, deputy marshals and such other officials of the Service as may be designated by the Director, in executing the laws of the United States within a State, to exercise the same powers which a sheriff of the State may exercise in executing the laws thereof.

Except for suits by incarcerated persons, non-prisoner litigants proceeding &quot;in forma pauperis&quot;, or (in some circumstances) by seamen, U.S. Marshals no longer serve leading process or subpoenas in private civil actions filed in the U.S. district courts. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, process may be served by any U.S. citizen over the age of 18 who is not a party involved in the case. The Marshals still levy executions and serve writs of garnishment.

===Witness Protection Program===
A chief responsibility of the Marshals is the United States Federal Witness Protection Program.

===Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS)===
The Marshals Service operates the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS), an airline used mainly to transport inmates between prisons and courts across the United States; multiple Marshals guard the prisoners on every flight. The service is also used to carry out ordered deportations of undocumented immigrants.

===Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015===
The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 amends the federal judicial code to authorize the United States Marshals Service to assist state, local, tribal, and other federal law enforcement agencies, upon request, in locating and recovering missing children. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act also established The Missing Child Unit of The Marshals Service.

===Fugitive programs===
The Marshals Service publicizes the names of wanted persons it places on the list of U.S. Marshals 15 Most Wanted Fugitives, which is similar to and sometimes overlaps the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives Most Wanted List, depending on jurisdiction.

The 15 Most Wanted Fugitive Program was established in 1983 in an effort to prioritize the investigation and apprehension of high-profile offenders who are considered to be some of the country&#x27;s most dangerous fugitives. These offenders tend to be career criminals with histories of violence or whose instant offense(s) pose a significant threat to public safety. Current and past fugitives in this program include murderers, sex offenders, major drug kingpins, organized crime figures, and individuals wanted for high-profile financial crimes.

The Major Case Fugitive Program was established in 1985 in an effort to supplement the successful 15 Most Wanted Fugitive Program. Much like the 15 Most Wanted Fugitive Program, the Major Case Fugitive Program prioritizes the investigation and apprehension of high-profile offenders who are considered to be some of the country&#x27;s most dangerous individuals. All escapes from custody are automatically elevated to Major Case status.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported on November 14, 2014, that the Marshals Service&#x27;s Technical Operations Group utilizes a so-called dirtbox to track fugitives.

===Special Operations Group===
The Special Operations Group (SOG) was created in 1971, and is the Marshals Service&#x27;s tactical unit. It is a self-supporting response team capable of responding to emergencies anywhere in the U.S. or its territories.

Most of the deputy marshals who have volunteered to be SOG members serve as full-time deputies in Marshals Service offices throughout the nation, and they remain on call 24 hours a day. The SOG also maintains a small, full-time operational cadre stationed at the Marshals Service Tactical Operations Center at Louisiana National Guard Training Center Pineville, Louisiana, where all deputies undergo extensive, specialized training in tactics and weaponry.

Deputies must meet rigorous physical and mental standards. The group&#x27;s missions include: apprehending fugitives, protecting dignitaries, providing court security, transporting high-profile and dangerous prisoners, providing witness security, and seizing assets.

===Office of Protective Operations===
The Office of Protective Operations (OPO) is the United States Marshals Service&#x27;s preeminent expert on physical protection. OPO provides subject matter expertise, guidance, and direct action support to district offices on high-threat/-profile proceedings and risk-/threat-based protective operations. The footprint is national, covering all twelve federal judicial circuits across the country, with the ability to project globally.

Currently, the OPO is responsible for two permanent risk-based protection details for the Deputy Attorney General (DAG) and the Secretary of Education (SecEd), respectively.

These Senior Inspectors routinely deploy across the U.S. and around the globe to protect the DAG and Secretary of Education. They lead security for nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court through the pendency of the nomination, which are often fraught with threats of violence and protests. They also provide security for sitting U.S. Supreme Court Justices, when those Justices are farther than 50 miles from Washington, D.C., where the U.S. Supreme Court Police have statutory protection authority. As a result, they develop a deep expertise in protective operations and partner extensively with the U.S. Secret Service, Diplomatic Security Service, along with local, state, federal, and foreign law enforcement and security agencies.

In 2019, the Trump administration investigated the feasibility of shifting protective responsibility for many government officials to the U.S. Marshals.

==Training and equipment==

===Training===
Marshals Service hiring is competitive and comparable to the selection process for Special Agent positions in agencies with similar duties. Typically fewer than five percent of qualified applicants are hired and must possess at a minimum a four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree or competitive work experience (which is usually three or more years at a local or state police department). While the USMS&#x27;s hiring process is not entirely public, applicants must pass a written test, an oral board interview, an extensive background investigation, a medical examination and drug test, and multiple Fitness In Total (FIT) exams to be selected for training. Deputy U.S. Marshals complete a 18-week training program at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Georgia.

===Firearms and protective gear===
The primary handgun for marshals is usually a Glock 22. Deputy Marshals may also carry a backup gun, but it must meet certain requirements. Deputy Marshals are also equipped with body armor and collapsible batons for daily use, and ballistic shields, helmets, and protective goggles for serving high risk warrants.

Members of the U.S. Marshal SOG Teams are armed with The Staccato Model P 2011 pistols in 9mm Parabellum. They have both a full size with a red dot sight as well as a smaller, more concealable version for covert operations. In 2019, the SOG adopted the STI 2011, a 1911 platform of pistol that is modified for USMS SOG needs.

All marshals have a variety of AR-platform rifles, shotguns, and less-lethal options available for their use. Recently, the service has introduced a body-worn camera (BWC) program. Marshals are issued various body armor including a concealable vest, a tactical vest that accepts their soft-armor panels and rifle plates, as well as a rifle plate only carrier depending on their needs. Ballistic helmets and shields are also available.

===Surveillance airplanes===
The U.S. Marshals Service has planes registered under a front company named Early Detection Alarm Systems, which has an address of a UPS Store mailbox in Spring, Texas. This operation has been in place since at least 2007, and by 2014 were based in five airports across the country.

The planes tend to fly in a tight circle; GPS/radio trackers, cameras, video recorder, and video transmitter installations are documented. It is also presumed to include an IMSI-catcher such as the Stingray phone tracker or the Boeing DRTbox (Dirtbox), which are used by the Marshals&#x27; Technical Operations Group.

; Observed locations of U.S. Marshals planes:
* Mexico states of Sinaloa and Durango during April–May, July, and November 2017, including during the capture of a Sinaloa Cartel member in El Dorado, Sinaloa on May 1, 2017
* Guatemala
* Carver Shores, Orlando, Florida, January 2017

==Organization==

The Marshals Service is based in Arlington County, Virginia, and, under the authority of the Attorney General, is headed by a director, who is assisted by a deputy director. The Director is supervised by the Deputy Attorney General. The Marshals Service headquarters provides command, control, and cooperation for the disparate elements of the service.

===Federal judicial districts===
The U.S. court system is divided into 94 federal judicial districts, each with a district court (except the territory of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, which share a U.S. Marshal). For each district there is a presidentially-appointed and Senate-confirmed United States Marshal, a Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal (GS-14 or 15) (and an Assistant Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal in certain larger districts), Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshals (GS-13), and as many deputy U.S. Marshals (GS-7 and above) and special deputy U.S. Marshals as needed. In the United States federal budget for 2005, funds for 3,067 deputy marshals and criminal investigators were provided. The U.S. Marshal for each United States courts of appeals (the 13 circuit courts) is the U.S. Marshal in whose district that court is physically located.

The director and each United States Marshal are appointed by the President of the United States and subject to confirmation by the U.S. Senate. The District U.S. Marshal is traditionally appointed from a list of qualified law enforcement personnel for that district or state. Each state has at least one district, while several larger states have three or more.

==Personnel==

===Titles===
Agency executives
* The director, originally titled the Chief United States Marshal, overall head of the USMS and overseer of the Marshals.
* The deputy director, principal deputy and first in line of succession to the director.

Marshals
* United States Marshal: the top executive of the Marshals Service in each of the 94 federal judicial districts, appointed by the president subject to confirmation by the senate
* Chief Deputy United States Marshal: the senior career manager for the federal judicial district who is responsible for management of the Marshals office and staff
* Supervisory Deputy United States Marshal, responsible for the supervision of three or more deputy U.S. Marshals and clerks
* Deputy United States Marshal: for all nonsupervisory positions

===Deputy Marshals===
Deputy U.S. Marshals start their careers at the GS-7 pay grade. After the first year in grade, they are promoted to GS-9, then to GS-11 after a second year, and then to GS-12 after a third year. Once deputies reach the GS-11 pay grade, they are reclassified as 1811 Criminal Investigators. Criminal Investigators work additional hours and receive an additional 25% Law Enforcement Availability Pay on top of their base pay.

Duties performed include criminal investigations, execution of warrants, and other investigative operations. They also protect government officials, process seized assets of crime rings for investigative agencies, and relocate and arrange new identities for federal witnesses in the United States Federal Witness Protection Program, which is headed by the USMS. After Congress passed the Adam Walsh Act, the U.S. Marshals Service was chosen to head the new federal sex offender tracking and prosecution team.

===Special Deputy Marshals===
The Director of the United States Marshals Service is authorized to deputize the following persons to perform the functions of a Deputy U.S. Marshal in any district designated by the Director:
* Selected officers or employees of the Department of Justice;
* Selected federal, state, or local law enforcement officers whenever the law enforcement needs of the U.S. Marshals Service so require;
* Selected employees of private security companies in providing courtroom security for the Federal judiciary;
* Other persons designated by the Associate Attorney General pursuant to 28 CFR 0.19(a)(3).

===Coast Guard as Deputy Marshals===
Commissioned officers in the United States Coast Guard may be appointed as United States Deputy Marshals in Alaska.

===Court Security Officers===
Court Security Officers (CSOs) are contracted former law enforcement officers who receive limited deputations as armed Special Deputy Marshals and play a role in courthouse security. Using security screening systems, Court Security Officers attempt to detect and intercept weapons and other prohibited items that individuals attempt to bring into federal courthouses. There are more than 5,000 Court Security Officers with certified law enforcement experience deployed at more than 400 federal court facilities in the United States and its territories.

===Inspectors===
The Marshal Service has the positions of Inspector, Senior Inspector and Chief Inspector, depending on the duties and position to which a Deputy Marshal has been assigned to.
This title was created for promotions within the service usually for senior non-supervisory personnel. Senior Deputy Marshals assigned to regional fugitive task forces or working in special assignments requiring highly skilled criminal investigators often receive the title Inspector. Operational non-supervisory employees assigned to the Witness Protection Program are given the title Senior Inspector. Deputy Marshals assigned to the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) department within the USMS also hold the title of Senior Inspector. Senior Inspectors receive a GS-13 pay grade level.

===Line-of-duty deaths===
More than 200 U.S. Marshals, deputy marshals, and special deputy marshals have been killed in the line of duty since Marshal Robert Forsyth was shot dead by an intended recipient of court papers in Augusta, Georgia, on January 11, 1794. He was the first U.S. federal law enforcement officer to be killed in the line of duty. The dead are remembered on an Honor Roll permanently displayed at Headquarters.

==Criticism and controversy==
===Inspector General audits===
An audit by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) (November 2010) of the Justice Department found &quot;weaknesses in the USMS&#x27;s efforts to secure federal court facilities in the six USMS district offices we visited&quot;. The report found, among other things, that the Marshals Service&#x27;s Judicial Security Division had contracted private security firms to provide Court Security Officers without having completed background checks. Another incident involved the Marshals Service awarding a $300 million contract to a security guard company named USProtect Corporation, which had a known history of numerous criminal activities leading to convictions for mail fraud and bank fraud and false insurance claims in addition to a civil judgment against its chief financial officer. Technical problems included court security officers not being properly trained on security screening equipment, which also meant equipment not being used. The OIG noted that in February 2009, several courthouses failed to detect mock explosives sent by Marshals Service Headquarters in order to test security procedures. They also found that 18% of court security officers had outdated firearms qualifications.

===Internal thefts===
On March 26, 2009, the body of Deputy U.S. Marshal Vincent Bustamante was discovered in Juárez, Mexico, according to the Marshals Service. Bustamante, who was accused of stealing and pawning government property, was a fugitive from the law at the time of his death. Chihuahua State Police said the body had multiple wounds to the head apparently consistent with an execution-style shooting.

In January 2007, Deputy U.S. Marshal John Thomas Ambrose was charged with theft of Justice Department property, disclosure of confidential information, and lying to federal agents during an investigation. Deputy Ambrose had been in charge of protecting mobster-turned-informant Nicholas Calabrese, who was instrumental in sending three mob bosses to prison for life. A federal jury convicted Ambrose on April 27, 2009, of leaking secret government information concerning Calabrese to William Guide, a family friend and former Chicago police officer who had also served time in prison for corruption. Ambrose also was convicted of theft of government property but acquitted of lying to federal agents. On October 27, 2009, Ambrose was sentenced to serve four years in prison.

===Racial discrimination===
In 1998, retired Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Matthew Fogg won a landmark EEO and Title VII racial discrimination and retaliation lawsuit against the Justice Department, for which he was awarded $4 million. The jury found the entire Marshals Service to be a &quot;racially hostile environment&quot; which discriminates against black employees in its promotion practices. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson summarized the jurors&#x27; decision by stating that they felt there was an &quot;atmosphere of racial disharmony and mistrust within the United States Marshal Service&quot;. As of 2011, Fogg is president of &quot;Bigots with Badges&quot;, and executive director of CARCLE (Congress Against Racism and Corruption in Law Enforcement), and is also associated with Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP), a drug law reform organization of law enforcement officers.

In September 2023, U.S. Marshals Service settled a $15 million, nearly 30-year-old EEOC class action lawsuit filed by Matthew Fogg in January, 1994. Alleging discrimination against African-American Deputy U.S. Marshal applicants, employees and Detention Officers with regard to hiring, promotions, recruitment and headquarter assignments.

===Ruby Ridge===
The Department of Justice under Janet Reno acknowledged wrongdoing in U.S. marshals&#x27; decisions surrounding a firefight at Ruby Ridge in 1992, where a deputy U.S. marshal shot 14-year-old Samuel Weaver in the back. Afterwards, deputy U.S. marshals became involved in a gunfight with Weaver&#x27;s father, who was wanted on a federal warrant for failure to appear, and another person. Deputy U.S. marshals dispute this claim. Deputy U.S. marshal Billy Deegan was killed during a surveillance operation after identifying himself as a federal agent. This led to an extended gunfight in which both sides fired several rounds. Samuel Weaver was shot and killed. His body was taken to a small building for more than a week and an autopsy was unable to determine entry and exit wounds (see Idaho Federal Court Transcripts for clarification of this incident). &quot;Newsweek&quot; described the incident as &quot;one of the most shameful episodes in the history of American law enforcement&quot;.

<text>Montu was a falcon-god of war in the ancient Egyptian religion, an embodiment of the conquering vitality of the pharaoh. He was particularly worshipped in Upper Egypt and in the district of Thebes.

== Name ==
Montu&#x27;s name, shown in Egyptian hieroglyphs to the right, is technically transcribed as &quot;mntw&quot; (meaning &quot;Nomad&quot;). Because of the difficulty in transcribing Egyptian vowels, it is often realized as Mont, Monthu, Montju, Ment or Menthu.

== Role and characteristics ==

A very ancient god, Montu was originally a manifestation of the scorching effect of Ra, the sun – and as such often appeared under the epithet Montu-Ra. The destructiveness of this characteristic led to him gaining characteristics of a warrior, and eventually becoming a widely revered war-god. The Egyptians thought that Montu would attack the enemies of Maat (that is, of the truth, of the cosmic order) while inspiring, at the same time, glorious warlike exploits. It is possible that Montu-Ra and Atum-Ra symbolized the two kingships, respectively, of Upper and Lower Egypt. When linked with Horus, Montu&#x27;s epithet was &quot;Horus of the Strong Arm&quot;.

Because of the association of raging bulls with strength and war, the Egyptians also believed that Montu manifested himself as a white, black-snouted bull named Buchis (hellenization of the original Bakha: a living bull revered in Armant) — to the point that, in the Late Period (7th-4th centuries BC), Montu was depicted with a bull&#x27;s head too. This special sacred bull had dozens of servants and wore precious crowns and bibs. 

In Egyptian art, Montu was depicted as a falcon-headed or bull-headed man, with his head surmounted by the solar disk (because of his conceptual link with Ra) with either a double or singular uraeus, and two feathers. The falcon was a symbol of the sky and the bull was a symbol of strength and war. He could also wield various weapons, such as a curved sword, a spear, bow and arrows, or knives: such military iconography was widespread in the New Kingdom (16th-11th centuries BC).

Montu had several consorts, including the little-known Theban goddesses Tjenenyet and Iunit, and a female form of Ra, Raet-Tawy. He was also revered as one of the patrons of the city of Thebes and its fortresses. The sovereigns of the 11th Dynasty (c. 2134–1991 BC) chose Montu as a protective and dynastic deity, inserting references to him in their own names. For example, four pharaohs of the 11th Dynasty were called &quot;Mentuhotep&quot;, which means &quot;Montu (Mentu) is satisfied&quot;:

* Mentuhotep I (c. 2135 BC) — maybe a fictional figure; 
* Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II (c. 2061–2010 BC); 
* Sankhkare Mentuhotep III (c. 2010–1998 BC); 
* Nebtawyre Mentuhotep IV (c. 1998–1991 BC).

The Greeks associated Montu with their god of war Ares – although that did not prevent his assimilation to Apollo, probably due to the solar radiance that distinguished him.

== Montu and the pharaohs at war ==
The cult of this military god enjoyed great prestige under the pharaohs of the 11th Dynasty, whose expansionism and military successes led, around 2055 BC, to the reunification of Egypt, the end of a period of chaos known today as the First Intermediate Period, and a new era of greatness for the country. This part of Egyptian history, known as the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC), was a period in which Montu assumed the role of supreme god — before then gradually being surpassed by the other Theban god Amun, destined to become the most important deity of the Egyptian pantheon.

From the 11th Dynasty onward, Montu was considered the symbol of the pharaohs as rulers, conquerors and winners, as well as their inspirer on the battlefield. The Egyptian armies were surmounted by the insignia of the &quot;four Montu&quot; (Montu of Thebes, of Armant, of Medamud, and of El-Tod: the main cult centers of the god), all represented while trampling and piercing enemies with a spear in a classic pugnacious pose. A ceremonial battle ax, belonging to the funeral kit of Queen Ahhotep II, Great Royal Wife of the warlike pharaoh Kamose (c. 1555–1550 BC), who lived between the 17th and 18th Dynasty, represents Montu as a proud winged griffin: an iconography clearly influenced by the same Syriac origin which inspired Minoan art.

Egypt&#x27;s greatest general-kings called themselves &quot;Mighty Bull&quot;, &quot;Son Of Montu&quot;, &quot;Montu Is with His Strong/Right Arm&quot; (&quot;Montuherkhepeshef&quot;: which was also the given name of a son of Ramesses II, of one of Ramesses III and one of Ramesses IX). Thutmose III (c. 1479—1425 BC), &quot;the Napoleon of Egypt&quot;, was described in ancient times as a &quot;Valiant Montu on the Battlefield&quot;. An inscription from his son Amenhotep II (1427–1401 BC) recalls that the eighteen-year-old pharaoh was able to shoot arrows through copper targets while driving a war chariot, commenting that he had the skill and strength of Montu. The latter&#x27;s grandson, Amenhotep III the Magnificent (c.1388–1350 BC), called himself &quot;Montu of the Rulers&quot; in spite of his own peaceful reign. In the narrative of the Battle of Kadesh (c. 1274 BC), Ramesses II the Great — who proudly called himself &quot;Montu of the Two Lands&quot; — was said to have seen the enemy and &quot;raged at them like Montu, Lord of Thebes&quot;.

== Temples ==
=== Medamud ===

The Temple complex of Montu in Medamud, the ancient Medu, less than five kilometers north-east of today&#x27;s Luxor, was built by the great Pharaoh Senusret III (c. 1878–1839 BC) of the 12th Dynasty, probably on a pre-existing sacred site of the Old Kingdom. The temple courtyard was used as a dwelling for the living Buchis bull, revered as an incarnation of Montu. The main entrance was to the north-east, while a sacred lake was probably on the west side of the sanctuary. The building consisted of two distinct adjoining sections, perhaps a temple to the north and a temple to the south (houses of the priests). It was built in raw bricks, while the innermost cella of the deity was built of carved stone. The templar complex of Medamud underwent important restorations and renovations during the New Kingdom, and in the Ptolemaic and Roman period.

=== Armant ===

At Armant, the ancient Iuni, there was an impressive Temple of Montu at least since the 11th Dynasty, which may have been native of Armant. King Mentuhotep II is its first known builder, but the original complex was enlarged and embellished during the 12th Dynasty, the less well-known 13th Dynasty (c. 1803–1649 BC), and later in the New Kingdom (especially under King Thutmose III). Ramesses II (1279–1213 BC) and his son Merneptah (1213–1203 BC) of the 19th Dynasty added colossi and statues. It was dismantled, except for a pylon, in the Late Period (7th/4th century BC) — but a new temple was begun by King Nectanebo II (360–342 BC), the last native pharaoh of Egypt, and continued by the Ptolemies. In the 1st century BC, Cleopatra VII (51–30 BC) built a mammisi and a sacred lake there in honour of her son, the very young Ptolemy XV Caesarion. The building remained visible until 1861, when it was demolished to reuse its material in the construction of a sugar factory; however, etchings, prints and previous studies (for example the Napoleonic &quot;Description de l&#x27;Égypte&quot;) show its appearance. Only the remains of the pylon of Thutmose III are still visible — in addition to the ruins of two entrances, one of which was built under the 2nd century AD Roman emperor/Pharaoh Antoninus Pius. In the large Armant complex, moreover, there was the Bucheum, necropolis of the Buchis sacred bulls. The first burial of a Buchis in this special necropolis dates back to the reign of Nectanebo II (c. 340 BC), while the final one took place at the time of the Emperor/Pharaoh Diocletian (c. 300 AD).

=== Karnak and Uronarti ===
In the great Karnak Temple Complex, north of the monumental Temple of Amun, King Amenhotep III built a sacred enclosure to Montu. Another temple had been dedicated to him at the little-known fortress of Uronarti (near the Second Cataract of the Nile, specifically to the south of it) during the Middle Kingdom.

<text>In Egyptian mythology, Buchis (, ) (also spelt Bakh and Bakha) was the deification of the kꜣ (&quot;power, life-force&quot;, Egyptological pronunciation &quot;ka&quot;) of the war god Montu as a sacred bull that was worshipped in the region of Hermonthis. In order to being chosen as the Buchis incarnation of Montu, a bull was required to have a white body and black face. When these bulls – and in later times also their mothers – died, they were mummified, and placed in a special cemetery known as the &quot;Bucheum&quot;.

Unlike the other Egyptian sacred bulls – the Apis and the Mnevis – the Buchis cult started towards the end of the pharaonic period, with the earliest known burial taking place in regnal year 14 of Nectanebo II (mid 4th century BC). However, four different bull cults dedicated to Montu were known in earlier times in Upper Egypt, and it seems that the Buchis was the result of their syncretism. Eventually, the Buchis bull was identified as a form of the Apis, and consequently became considered an incarnation of Osiris.

It is uncertain when the Buchis cult disappeared. The last confirmed tomb at the Bucheum is dated to the regnal year 12 of Diocletian (circa 295 CE), while the latest attestation of a Buchis burial is a stela reporting its installation in regnal year 33 of Diocletian (317 CE) and its demise in regnal year 57 of the same pharaoh (more precisely on 4 November 340 CE).

<text>Sarmizegetusa Regia (also known as &quot;Sarmisegetusa&quot;, &quot;Sarmisegethusa&quot;, &quot;Sarmisegethuza&quot;; ) was the capital and the most important military, religious and political centre of the Dacians before the wars with the Roman Empire. Built on top of a 1200 m high mountain, the fortress, consisting of six citadels, was the core of a strategic and defensive system in the Orăștie Mountains (in present-day Romania).

Sarmizegetusa Regia should not be confused with Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa, the Roman capital of Dacia built by Roman Emperor Trajan some 40 km away, which was not the Dacian capital. Sarmizegetusa Ulpia was discovered earlier, was known already in the early 1900s, and was initially mistaken for the Dacian capital, a confusion which led to incorrect conclusions being made regarding the military history and organization of the Dacians.

== Etymology ==
Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain the origin of the name &quot;Sarmizegetusa&quot;. The most important of these ascribe the following possible meanings to the city&#x27;s name:

* &#x27;Center where horse-mounted archers meet&#x27; from &quot;sar&quot; &#x27;horse&#x27; (Getian and Sarmatian) combined with &quot;gethusa&quot; &#x27;arrow&#x27; (cognate with Sarmatian &quot;sageta&quot;) and &quot;gethate&quot; &#x27;center&#x27; (cognate Sarmatian &quot;cetate&quot;)
* ‘Citadel built of palisades on a mountain peak’ from &quot;zermi&quot; (*gher-mi ‘mountain peak, top’, cf. *gher ‘stone; high’) and &quot;zeget&quot; (*geg(H)t)
* ‘City of the warm river’ from &quot;zarmi&quot; ‘warm’ (cognate with Sanskrit &quot;gharma&quot; ‘warm’) and &quot;zeget&quot; ‘flow’ (cognate with Sanskrit &quot;sarj-&quot; in &quot;sarjana-&quot; ‘flow’ and Bactrian &quot;harez-&quot; in &quot;harezâna&quot; ‘id.’), the city being named after the nearby river Sargetia
* ‘Palace illuminating the world of life’ from &quot;zaryma&quot; ‘palace’ (cf. Sanskrit &quot;harmya&quot; ‘palace’), &quot;zegeth&quot; ‘world of life’ (cf. Sanskrit &quot;jagat&quot;- ‘go’, and &quot;jigat&quot;- ‘mobility; world of life’) and &quot;usa&quot; ‘illuminating, enlightening; burning’)
* &#x27;SARMIS.E[T].GETUSA REGIA&#x27; is an alternate spelling of the full Latin name of the location. It translates to, the capital city/royal court of the Sarmatian and Getae/Gets. Getae and Dacians were interchangeable terms. The -A after GETUS is part of the genitive case in Latin, indicating ownership. This is plausible as the Dacians were allied with the Sarmatians (e.g., Roxolani) during the Dacian Wars in the early first century CE.

== Layout ==
Sarmizegetusa Regia contained a citadel and residential areas with dwellings and workshops as well as a sacred zone.
* The fortress, a quadrilateral formed by massive stone blocks (murus dacicus), was constructed on five terraces, on an area of almost 30,000 m².
* The sacred zone — among the most important and largest circular and rectangular Dacian sanctuaries – includes a number of rectangular temples, the bases of their supporting columns still visible in regular arrays. Perhaps the most enigmatic construction at the site is the large circular sanctuary. It consisted of a setting of timber posts in the shape of a D, surrounded by a timber circle which in turn was surrounded by a low stone kerb. The layout of the timber settings bears some resemblance to the stone monument at Stonehenge in England.
* An artifact referred to as the “Andesite Sun&quot; seems to have been used as a sundial. Since it is known that Dacian culture was influenced by contact with Hellenisitic Greece, the sundial may have resulted from the Dacians&#x27; exposure to Hellenistic learning in geometry and astronomy.
* Civilians lived below the citadel itself in settlements built on artificial terraces, such as the one at Feţele Albe. A system of ceramic pipes channeled running water into the residences of the nobility.

The archaeological inventory found at the site demonstrates that Dacian society had a relatively high standard of living.

== History ==

=== Variants of the name of the city===
Historical records show considerable variation in the spelling of the name of the Dacian capital:

* Zarmigethusa, Sarmisegethusa (Ptolemy, Geography, 2nd century AD)
* Zermizegethusa (Dio Cassius 2nd-3rd century)
* Sarmazege (Anonymous Geographer from Ravenna, around 700 AD)
* Sarmategte (Tabula Peutingeriana, 13th century)
* Zarmizegetusa and Sarmizegetusa (from inscriptions)
* Sargetia (name of the river nearby)

=== Pre-Roman era ===
Towards the end of his reign, Burebista transferred the Geto-Dacian capital from Argedava to Sarmizegetusa. Serving as the Dacian capital for at least one and a half centuries, Sarmizegethusa reached its zenith under King Decebal. Archeological findings suggest that the Dacian god Zalmoxis and his chief priest had an important role in Dacian society at this time. They have also shed new light on the political, economic and scientific development of the Dacians and their successful assimilation of technical and scientific knowledge from the Greek and Romans.

The site has yielded two especially notable finds:
* A medical kit, in a brassbound wooden box with an iron handle, containing a scalpel, tweezers, powdered pumice and miniature pots for pharmaceuticals
* A huge vase, 24 in (0.6 m) high and 41 in (1.04 m) across, bearing an inscription in the Roman alphabet: DECEBAL PER SCORILO, i.e. ‘Decebalus, son (cf. Latin &quot;puer&quot;) of Scorilus’ 
The smithies north of the sanctuary also provide evidence of the Dacians&#x27; skill in metalworking: findings include tools such as metre-long tongs, hammers and anvils which were used to make some 400 metallic artefacts — scythes, sickles, hoes, rakes, picks, pruning hooks, knives, plowshares, and carpenters&#x27; tools — as well as weapons such as daggers, curved Dacian scimitars, spearpoints, and shields.

Nevertheless, the flowering of Dacian civilization apparently underway during the reign of Decebalus came to an abrupt end when Trajan&#x27;s legions destroyed the city and deported its population.

=== The defensive system ===

The Dacian capital’s defensive system includes six Dacian fortresses — Sarmizegetusa, Costești-Blidaru, Piatra Roșie, Costești-Cetățuie, Căpâlna and Bănița.
All six have been named UNESCO World heritage sites.

=== Roman era ===
Sarmizegetusa&#x27;s walls were partly dismantled at the end of the First Dacian War in AD 102, when Dacia was invaded by the Emperor Trajan of the Roman Empire and rebuilt as Roman fortifications. The latter were subsequently destroyed, possibly by the Dacians, and then rebuilt again following the successful siege of the site in AD 105–6.

The Roman conquerors established a military garrison at Sarmizegetusa Regia. Later, the capital of Roman Dacia was established 40 km from the ruined Dacian capital, and was named after it - Colonia Ulpia Traiana Augusta Dacica Sarmizegetusa.

<doc id="98226" wikidata="Q4454907" url="?curid=98226" title="Unification Theological Seminary">
<text>HJ International Graduate School for Peace and Public Leadership is a private Unification Church-affiliated graduate seminary headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, New York. It was known as Unification Theological Seminary (UTS) from its founding in 1975 until July 2023. 

In September 1975, UTS acquired a 250-acre campus, including a former Catholic novitiate dating to 1931 and circa 1886 mansion, in Barrytown, Dutchess County, New York. Its first class entered that year and consisted of 56 MRE students. 

The seminary was granted an absolute charter from the State of New York in January 1984 and received accreditation from the Middle States Commission on Higher Education in November 1996.

Following a decline in enrollment and financial challenges, it was sold in January 2024 to nearby Bard College. Since then, all instruction is now conducted through the seminary’s New York City headquarters.

== Students and alumni ==

While the majority of UTS students have been Unification Church members, there are also students from other faiths. Historically, the UTS faculty has included academics representing the Jewish, Islamic, and Christian faiths, as well as Unificationist faculty with degrees from Ivy League universities, as well as the Graduate Theological Union, The New School, Vanderbilt University, and Drew University, among others. The seminary has over 125 students enrolled in its three Master degrees and in its Doctor of Ministry (DMin) program. Most Unification Church leaders in the United States hold UTS degrees. UTS graduates have also played major leadership roles in many of the Unification Church-related organizations in the United States, as well as Unification-inspired civil society and corporate entities including the Universal Peace Federation, the Family Federation for World Peace, World Collegiate Association for the Research of Principles (CARP), the American Clergy Leadership Conference, World &amp; I Magazine, Paragon Publishers, the Professors World Peace Academy, Unification Theological Seminary, and the Women’s Federation for World Peace. As of 2022, there are over 1,550 UTS graduates.

== Research and publication ==
Since its inception, the Unification Theological Seminary has served as the principal venue to provide formal, academic religious and theological training for its Church leaders. It has offered courses in New Testament, Old Testament, the Pauline Epistles, Patristics, Hermeneutics, Church History, Apologetics as well as Islam, East Asian Religion, Religious Education, Peace Studies, as well as in the Unification Church’s own canon of Divine Principle, Unification Thought, the Teachings and Writings of Sun Myung Moon and Hak Ja Han Moon and their applications, and other related sources.

The seminary has played an important role in Unification apologetics, academic research related to the movement’s historical development, and in the articulation of the Unificationist perspective. Young Oon Kim, the Unification Church’s first theologian and the first Korean missionary to the United States, taught at Unification Theological Seminary from its founding in 1975 until just prior to her death in 1989. Kim authored several seminal church academic texts including &quot;Unification Principle and its Applications&quot; (1980) &quot;and Unification Theology&quot; (1980), &quot;Unification Thought and Christian Theology&quot; (date), and &quot;Systematic Theology.&quot; David S.C. Kim, an early missionary, who served as President of the Unification Theological Seminary from 1975-1994 edited the authoritative three-volume &quot;Day of Hope in Review&quot; texts, comprehensive collections of the press coverage of the early years of Moon&#x27;s speaking tours in the United States. Andrew Wilson, a Harvard-trained Old Testament Scholar, oversaw the selection of texts and the editing of &quot;World Scriptures&quot; (1991) and also served as co-author together with Joong Hyun Pak of &quot;True Family Values&quot;. Wilson is currently working with Hee Hun Standard in the translation, editing, preparation for publication of 원리 원본 (Wolli Wonbon), the original draft of Unification teachings personally drafted by Sun Myung Moon. Michael Mickler’s &quot;History of the Unification Church in America&quot; (1993) and his &quot;40 Years in America: An Intimate History of the Unification Movement 1959-1999&quot; (2000) are authoritative texts on the Unification Movement, documenting both its achievements and challenges. Over the past five decades, numerous volumes on Theology, Church History, Religious Education, Inter-Religious Dialogue, Peace Studies, Evolution, Threats to Ecosystems, and on the Philosophy of Science have been published by UTS faculty and alums, including Jonathan Wells, Thomas Walsh, Karen Smith, Keisuke Noda, Frank Kaufmann, Frederick Swarts, and Kathy Winings, who currently serves as National President of the Religious Education Association. The seminary also sponsors &quot;The Journal of Unification Studies,&quot; an academic journal.

==Academics==
The seminary offers four distinct degree programs:
==Presidents==
==Notable alumni==
*Daniel Fefferman, executive director of the International Coalition for Religious Freedom.
*Michael Jenkins, president of U.S. Unification Church (2000–2009)

<text>Piquet (; ) is an early 16th-century plain-trick card game for two players that became France&#x27;s national game. David Parlett calls it a &quot;classic game of relatively great antiquity... still one of the most skill-rewarding card games for two&quot; but one which is now only played by &quot;aficionados and connoisseurs.&quot; Historically also known as Sant or Saunt from the French &quot;Cent&quot;.

==History==
Piquet is one of the oldest card games still being played. It is first mentioned, as &quot;Le Cent&quot;, in a written reference dating to 1535, in &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; by Rabelais. Although legend attributes the game&#x27;s creation to Stephen de Vignolles, also known as La Hire, a knight in the service of Charles VII during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, it may possibly have come into France from Spain because the words &quot;&quot;pique&quot; and &quot;repique&quot;&quot;, the main features of the game, are of Spanish origin. The earliest clear mention of the game – leaving aside various predecessors – is in 1585 by Jacques Perrache, described as a &quot;Provençal gentleman&quot;, who refers to two unusual games, &quot;premieres, &amp; piquets&quot;.

The game was introduced in Germany during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and texts of that period provide substantial evidence of its vogue, like the metaphorical use of the word &quot;&quot;repique&quot; in the 1634–8 political poem &quot;Allamodisch Picket Spiel&quot; (&quot;Piquet Game à la mode&quot;&quot;), which reflects the growing popularity of the game at that time. As with other games like &quot;Bête,&quot; the substantive form of the word &quot;piquet&quot; was turned into a verb and this is used substantially by Rist&#x27;s 1640 &quot;Spiele, die man Picquetten heißet&quot;, who gives the word his grudging assent. Historical sources also distinguish between &quot;Rummel-Piquet&quot;, the normal game in which &quot;Rummel&quot; referred to the feature of &quot;point&quot;, and &quot;Offenherziges Piquet&quot; (lit.: &quot;Open-hearted Piquet&quot;), which was played ouverte. Mizka states that the former was known as &quot;Ronfelspiel&quot; (French: &quot;Ronfler&quot;) until 1664.

Until the early twentieth century, piquet was perhaps the most popular card game in France, occupying a similar position to cribbage in England. It first became popular in England after the marriage of Mary I of England to Philip II of Spain in 1554. During this period the game was known as cent, after the Spanish game &quot;cientos&quot;, referring to the fact that one of the chief goals of piquet is to reach 100 points. Following the marriage of King Charles I of England to Henrietta Maria of France in 1625, the British adopted the French name for the game. It went in and out of fashion among the upper classes in Britain between the 17th and early 20th centuries, its demise from the end of the First World War being put down to the rise of Gin Rummy &quot;and other lowbrow games that are easier to learn and faster to play.&quot;

==Rules==

Piquet is played with a 32-card pack, normally referred to as a &quot;piquet pack&quot; or &quot;piquet deck&quot;. The pack comprises the 7s through to 10s, the face cards, and the aces in each suit, and can be created by removing all 2–6 values from a 52-card poker pack. Each game consists of a &quot;partie&quot; of six deals (&quot;partie&quot; meaning match in French). The player scoring the most points wins (see the scoring section for further details).

===Cards===
In Piquet cards rank as follows (from highest to lowest) :



===Cut===
The player who cuts the higher card has to deal, and the dealer has the choice of cards at the commencement of each partie. A &quot;partie&quot; consists of six deals. The players deal alternately for each hand in the &quot;partie&quot;. It is preferable to deal first so as not to deal the last hand. Dealing puts a player at a disadvantage.

===Deal===
Twelve cards are dealt to each player, with the remaining eight forming the &quot;talon&quot;, which is placed face-down between the players. The talon may be split by the dealer into two piles of five and three cards, respectively. The dealer is referred to as the &quot;younger hand&quot; and the non-dealer as the &quot;elder hand.&quot;

===Exchanging cards===
The goal of exchanging cards is to improve one&#x27;s hand before the declaration and the play. The elder hand exchanges first. This is done by taking one to five cards from the hand and placing them face down. An equal number is then drawn from the talon. At least one card must be exchanged. The player must state how many cards he intends to exchange if fewer than the maximum. If the elder chooses to take fewer than the maximum, he may then look at the remainder from the five (which are the first ones that the younger will take).

The younger hand exchanges next. Again, at least one card must be exchanged. The younger may also exchange up to five cards, depending on how many the elder exchanged. If the elder exchanged all five, then the younger may only exchange up to the three remaining in the talon.

===Carte blanche===
After the deal, players sort their cards in their hands. A player with no court cards (J, Q, K) may declare &quot;&quot;carte blanche&quot;,&quot; which is worth 10 points. &quot;Carte blanche&quot; should be declared immediately. Either player declaring &quot;carte blanche&quot; must show their hand to the other. However, to preserve fairness, a formal protocol should be followed:

====Elder has &quot;carte blanche&quot;====
* Elder declares the number of cards that will be exchanged, and sets them to the side.
* Younger chooses cards to be exchanged, and sets them to the side.
* Elder displays entire hand, including cards set aside.

====Younger has &quot;carte blanche&quot;====
* Younger displays after elder has exchanged cards.

A hand of this type is fairly rare, appearing roughly once every 1,800 hands. Although it often scores poorly, it is usually advantageous to declare it to prevent the opponent from scoring pique or repique, despite the tactical disadvantage of giving information to the opponent.

Note: It is impossible for both players to hold &quot;carte blanche,&quot; so it will never happen that both players declare &quot;carte blanche&quot;. (There are 12 face cards in the pack (J,Q,K x 4). There are only 8 cards in the talon, so at least one player&#x27;s hand must hold some face cards.)

===Declaration phase===
In the declaration phase, the players ascertain who has the better hand in each of three categories: point, sequence, and set. This is done in an oblique sort of way that leads to some of the intrigue of piquet. Elder hand declares first always, with younger responding. In each part of the declaration, the younger hand may choose to contest the elder&#x27;s claim. By doing so, the younger may reveal information that would be useful during the trick-taking phase, called the play. Likewise, the elder may choose not to reveal information in one or more parts of the declaration.

====Point====
If the elder has at least four cards in a suit, he may make a declaration: for example, &quot;Point of four&quot;. The younger would then respond indicating that he has more, fewer, or the same number of cards in a suit. This is done by saying &quot;Good&quot; (the elder has more and wins the point), &quot;Not good&quot; (the elder has fewer), or &quot;Making?&quot; or &quot;How many?&quot;, indicating that the younger has the same number of cards in a suit, which requires clarification.

If both players have the same number of cards in a suit, then they must tally the value of the cards. The values of the cards are as follows: ace = 11, face cards = 10, and face value for the rest. After adding the values of the cards, the elder calls out the number. The younger may then say &quot;Good&quot;, if the elder&#x27;s value is greater, or &quot;Not good&quot; and the number that wins the point. For example: &quot;Not good: 39&quot; or &quot;Not good, I have 39&quot;. If the values are the same, younger says &quot;Equal&quot;.

The player with the better point scores the number of cards in the suit, not their value. If the values are the same, neither player scores. Note that younger does not actually score for any declarations until elder has led to the first trick in the play (see below).

====Sequence====
The next part of the declaration is the sequence, in which the longest consecutive run of cards is valued. A sequence must have at least three cards and they must all be in the same suit. Again, the elder hand starts. For example, &quot;Run of three&quot; or &quot;Sequence of four&quot;. The younger than responds with &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Not good&quot;, in the same way as before, or by contesting. To contest, the younger says &quot;How high?&quot;, to which the elder responds with the highest card in the sequence. For example, &quot;To the queen&quot;. Younger replies with &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Not good&quot; or &quot;Equal&quot;.

In keeping with the game&#x27;s ancestry, one may utilize the historical names for sequences in this part of the declaration, instead of the prosaic &quot;Run of three&quot;, for example. The following are the proper names and their associated values; those from 6 up are obsolete in English:

The person winning the sequence may declare any additional sequences that he has, if desired. If both players&#x27; best sequences are equal then neither player may score for any sequences.

====Set====
A set is three or four of a kind, ten or greater (7s, 8s, and 9s don&#x27;t count, and aces are highest). Sets of three are called &quot;trios&quot; or &quot;brelans&quot; and are worth 3 points, and sets of four, &quot;quatorzes&quot; (&quot;cat-orz&quot;), are worth 14 points. The declarations take place in the same manner as &quot;point&quot; and &quot;sequence&quot;, with elder stating his best set (for example, &quot;Three kings&quot;), to which younger replies &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Not good&quot;. The player with the best set may declare any additional sets that he has if desired.

====&quot;Carte rouge&quot;====
A variation is sometimes played in which 20 points are received if every card in a player&#x27;s hand is used at some point while making up one or more &quot;good&quot; declarations, &quot;carte blanche&quot; excluded. The points are scored at the time this occurs and are not subject to the order of point counting, below.

The following example should illustrate one way &quot;carte rouge&quot; may apply during a hand.

Six cards were good in points, and the other six were good in sequences.

The 20 points would then be awarded at that stage of the counting towards a &quot;repique&quot;.

====&quot;Pique&quot; and &quot;repique&quot;====
If a player scores 30 points during the declaration phase prior to his opponent scoring anything, that player gains a &quot;repique&quot;, which is worth an additional 60 points. If elder scores 30 points in declarations and play combined, before younger scores any points, then elder gains a &quot;pique&quot; and scores an additional 30 points. A player can only score either &quot;repique&quot; or &quot;pique&quot;, not both.

All declaration scoring must be evaluated in the following order, after the play of the first card by elder:

# &quot;Carte blanche&quot;
# Points
# Sequences
# Sets

If a player were to score more than 30 points in points and sequences before the other might score in sets, then the player would receive a &quot;repique&quot;.

For example: elder has a &quot;quatorze&quot; of aces for 14 points; younger has a point of 7 and two &quot;quints&quot; for a total of 37 points. According to the order of scoring, above, younger would receive the &quot;repique&quot; bonus.

Note that younger can never gain a &quot;pique&quot; because elder always scores one point for leading to the first trick (see below). By the end of the declaration, each player will have a pretty good idea of the other&#x27;s hand (to the degree that each chooses to claim their points).

Additionally, should elder achieve &quot;cards&quot;—more than 6 tricks—prior to younger winning any tricks, then the 10 points for &quot;cards&quot; may immediately be applied to a &quot;pique&quot;. If elder subsequently wins all the tricks, elder only receives the remaining 30 of the 40 points awarded for &quot;capot&quot;. The &quot;capot&quot; does not count towards a &quot;pique&quot;.

Equality has no effect on &quot;pique&quot; or &quot;repique&quot;.

&quot;Carte rouge&quot; is applied as soon as it occurs, and is not subject to the ordering, above; however, a common variation is that a &quot;pique&quot; or &quot;repique&quot; cannot be scored as the result of a &quot;Carte Rouge&quot; by the younger hand, once elder has played a first card.

===Play===
The play is the trick-taking part of the game. Players must follow suits with the elder hand placing a card face up and scoring one point. The younger than scores for their declarations and plays a card that follows suit, if possible. If not, he may discard anything he chooses. The winner of the trick (the player with the highest card in the suit led), takes the trick, placing it face-down (usually; see variations) in front of themself. The winner of the trick leads the next. When forced to discard, it is important to choose the right card. See tactics.

The score is usually kept verbally as play progresses. Trick score counts as follows:
* 1 point for leading a trick
* If the second player (the player who doesn&#x27;t lead) wins a trick, they get a point.
* The winner of the last trick wins a 1-point bonus (see variations).

==== Cards ====
The player with the greater number of tricks won at the end of play scores 10 for &quot;cards&quot;. If there is a tie, then neither player scores the additional points.

====&quot;Capot&quot;====
If all 12 tricks are won by one player, that player scores 40 points for &quot;capot&quot; (&quot;capot&quot; is the origin of the word &quot;&quot;).

===Scoring===
* Rubicon piquet: Six hands are played regardless of final score. The winner&#x27;s margin is computed as winner&#x27;s score – loser&#x27;s score + 100. If, however, the loser fails to score at least 100 points, then the final score is computed as: winner&#x27;s score + loser&#x27;s score + 100; since the loser failed to &quot;cross the Rubicon&quot;.

E.g. 105 to 101 = 4 + 100 = 104 to the winner; 97 to 89 = 97 + 89 + 100 = 286 to the winner

* Classic piquet, also known as &quot;piquet au cent&quot;: Played to 100 or 101 points, regardless of how many hands it takes to reach 100, usually five or six, uses a pack that includes the sixes of all four suits, and allows up to seven cards to be exchanged by the elder hand. In this variation, it is possible for both hands to score &quot;carte blanche&quot;, since the six of each suit is available to be used in a sequence of 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, A in each player&#x27;s hand, two suits each. Additionally, points are not accumulated for leading to a trick, but are rather earned by the winner of the trick, one point per 10-card or higher; thus, a person could win a trick, and earn 0, 1, or 2 points. There is no point for winning the last trick.

===Variations===
* Players may choose to keep tricks face up in front of them. 
* Players may look through both players&#x27; winning tricks. 
* The winner of the last trick may score 10 points instead of 1, making the choice of how to close the play more significant.
* Declarations state the total card values for points each time it is declared, not just when the dealer says &quot;Equal&quot;.
* &quot;Carte rouge&quot; may award 10 or 40 points instead of 20, at the players&#x27; discretion.

===Tactics===
Players discard low cards (nine or lower) even if this means getting rid of four or more of one suit. This diminishes the chances of winning the point round, but this round is the lowest scoring one. Getting rid of these lower cards to get straights of five or more is very beneficial and will increase one&#x27;s score greatly. Players may attempt to hold &quot;stop&quot; cards (usually queens or kings in their opponent&#x27;s strong suit) for the last stage of play, in order to block their opponent&#x27;s run of tricks with their long sequences.

==Background==

In &quot;The Gaming Table: Its Votaries and Victims&quot; author Andrew Steinmetz (18161877) describes how the game is played:

&lt;poem&gt;The card game piquet is said to have derived its name from that of its inventor, who contrived it to amuse Charles VI of France. The game was played with thirty two cards, that is, discarding out of the pack all the deuces, treys, fours, fives, and sixes. Regular piquet-packs were sold. In reckoning up the points, every card counted for its value, as ten for ten, nine for nine, and so on down to seven, which was, of course, the lowest; but the ace reckoned for eleven. All court cards reckoned for ten. As in other games, the ace won the king, the king the queen, and so on, to the knave, which won the ten. The cards were dealt at option by fours, threes, or twos, to the number of twelve, which was the hand— &#x27;discarding&#x27; being allowed; but both the dealer and he that led were obliged to discard at least one card. When the cards were played out, each counted his tricks; and he that had most reckoned 10 for winning the cards; if the tricks were equal, neither reckoned at all. He who, without playing (that is, according to the various terms of the game), could reckon up 30 in hand, when his antagonist reckoned nothing, scored 90 for them; this was called a repic; and all above 30 counted so many—32 counting 92, and so on. He who could make up 30, part in hand and part by play, before the other made anything, scored 60; this was called a pic.

The game was also played as pool precisely according to the rules briefly sketched as above, the penalty for losing being a guinea to the pool. Piquet required much practice to play it well. It became so great a favourite that, by the middle of the 18th century, the meanest people were well acquainted with it, and &#x27;let into all the tricks and secrets of it, in order to render them complete sharpers.&#x27; Such are the words of an old author, who adds that the game was liable to great imposition, and he explains the methods in use. Short cards were used for cutting, as in whist, at the time. Of these cards there were two sorts, one longer than the rest; and the advantage gained by them was as the adversary managed it, by cutting the longer or broader, as best suited his purpose, or imposing on the dealer, when it was his turn, to cut those that made most against him. The aces, kings, queens, and knaves were marked with dots at the corners, and in the very old book from which I am quoting precise directions are given how this marking can be effected in such a manner &#x27;as not to be discovered by your adversary, and at the same time appear plain to yourself. With a fine pointed pen and some clear spring water, players made dots upon the glazed card at the corners according to the above method; or they coloured the water with India ink, to make the marks more conspicuous. The work concludes as follows: There are but 32 cards made use of at piquet, so that just half of them will be known to you; and in dealing you may have an opportunity to give yourself those you like best; and if you cannot conveniently change the pack according to your desire, you will commonly know what you are to take in, which is a demonstrative advantage to win any one&#x27;s money.&lt;/poem&gt;

He also describes a &quot;card telegraphy&quot; signalling system used by cheaters. The 32 cards used in the game can be described using a combination of twelve signals—eight for the value of the card and four for its color. Steinmetz lists some signals and their meaning:

* Player looks at his confederate: A king.
* Player looks at the play of his adversary: A queen.
* Player looks at the stake: A knave.
* Player looks at the opposite: An ace. 
* Player&#x27;s mouth is slightly open: Hearts.
* Player&#x27;s mouth is closed: Diamonds.
* Player&#x27;s upper lip is &quot;slightly pouting over the lower&quot;: Clubs
* Player&#x27;s lower lip is drawn over the upper: Spades

Should a cheater wish to announce the knave and ace of hearts, he would glance at the stake and then to the opposite side, whilst keeping his mouth slightly open.

Steinmetz adds:

&lt;poem&gt;It is evident that this telegraphy may be employed at all games where there is a gallery. In effect, nothing is easier at piquet than to indicate, by the aid of these signals, the colour in which the player should discard and that in which he should keep what cards he has.

These are the simplest signs; but some of the [cheaters] have a great number of them, to designate everything; and even sometimes to communicate and receive intelligence, when necessary. This telegraphy is so imperceptible that it is difficult to describe it, and altogether impossible to detect it.&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Basset (French &quot;bassette&quot;, from the Italian &quot;bassetta&quot;), also known as barbacole and hocca, is a gambling game using cards, that was considered one of the most polite. It was intended for persons of the highest rank because of the great losses or gains that might be accrued by players.

==Basset in Italy==
According to DELI (&quot;Dizionario etimologico della lingua italiana&quot;), the word &quot;Basetta&quot; is first recorded in the first half of the 15th century. The game Basset is described by a few authors as having been invented in 1593 by a noble Venetian named Pietro Cellini, who was punished with exile in Corsica for his contrivance. It may have been devised out of the game of Hocca, Hoca or even Hoc, considered the precursor and an outlawed form of Italian roulette at which people lost considerable sums of money and also an early iteration of Biribi, which was brought into fashion by Cardinal Mazarin.

==Basset in France==
Basset was first introduced into France by Signior Justiniani, ambassador of Venice, in 1674.
The game was very popular at the court of King Charles II, and even after 15 January 1691 when Louis XIV issued an order from the privy council, by which he expressly forbade not only the officers belonging to his army, but likewise all other persons of whatever sex or denomination to play at Hoca, Pharaoh, Barbacole and Basset. The sums of money lost in France at this game were so considerable that the nobility were in danger of being undone after many persons of distinction were ruined. Later the law against gambling was tightened eluding which they disguised Basset under the name of &quot;pour et contre&quot;, that is, &quot;for and against&quot;.

By the constitution of Basset, large advantages were secured to the &quot;tailleur&quot; (the dealer / keeper of the bank) and so vast were their gains, that the privilege of keeping a bank at Basset, where the stakes were unlimited, was granted only to cadets or other members of great families. It was basically certain that a considerable fortune could be realized by the &quot;tailleur&quot; in a short time. The advantages of the dealer arise in many ways, but mainly from the temptations for adventurous players to increase their stakes on certain desperate chances, which rarely turn up, and which in the long run told largely in favor of the bank. Where licenses were otherwise conceded for keeping a public Basset table in France, the stakes were strictly limited to twelve pence.

==Basset in England==
Basset migrated to England in about 1677, introduced by a croupier called Morin, but never caught on outside Court circles on account of its costliness and the heavy risks it entailed on the players. Its heyday seems to have been in the early 18th century. It has no place in Cotton&#x27;s 1674 &quot;The Complete Gamester&quot;, but rates a lengthy entry in the 1721 edition where the fierceness of the gambling is stressed. It is there described as a &quot;French Game&quot;, presumably because it was imported from France. The game&#x27;s high stakes, along with its devastations, is the subject of Susanna Centlivre&#x27;s 1705 comedy &quot;The Basset Table&quot;.

The English made Basset quite different from what it was in France where, by royal edict, the public at large were not allowed to play at more than a franc or ten-penny bank, – and the losses or gains could not bring desolation to a family. In England the punters (gamblers) could do as they liked, staking from one guinea to one hundred guineas and more, upon a card. After three or four years, many players had impoverished their families to such an extent that Parliament enacted a prohibition with severe penalties against both games.
However, it was &quot;of so bewitching a nature,&quot; says our old writer, &quot;by reason of the several multiplications and advantages which it seemingly offered to the unwary punter, that a great many like it so well that they would play at small game rather than give out; and rather than not play at all would punt at six-penny, three-penny, nay, a two-penny bank, – so much did the hope of winning the quinze-et-le-va and the trente-et-le-va intoxicate them.&quot;

==The Edge==
The play in Basset resulted in, basically, a lottery. A player might occasionally win, but the big winner was the dealer (banker). The dealer had a number of privileges under the rules, including having the sole disposal of the first and last card; this gave them a significant edge. This was a truth so acknowledged in France that the king ordered, by public edict, that the privilege of a &quot;tallière&quot; (banker) should be allowed only to the &quot;chief cadets&quot; (sons of noblemen). His assumption was that whoever kept the bank must, in a very short time, acquire a considerable fortune.

== Modern Rules ==
This interpretation is based on the glossary and the rules in The Compleat Gamester as described in the 5th edition (1725).

Each player (&quot;punter&quot;) takes a &quot;book&quot; of cards from another deck (13 cards of the same suit). Players place cards whose rank they wish to bet on to the table. They can place as many (or as few) cards as they wish. The amount wagered (&quot;couch&quot;) on each card can also vary according to the player&#x27;s choice. No new cards may be added once play begins. 

The banker (&quot;talliere&quot;) shuffles a deck of 52 cards (without jokers) and lifts the deck to reveal the bottom card (&quot;fasse&quot;). Any players who have bets on this rank must pay half the value of their wager to the banker (from their personal stock, not from the cards themselves). This bottom card is then discarded. The banker then reveals the first players’ card (winning). Any players who have wagered on that card&#x27;s rank may receive a payout of 1:1. The banker then reveals a second card, the bank&#x27;s card (losing). Any players who wagered on this rank lose their wager and their card of that rank is removed from play (this rank can no longer truly &quot;win&quot; wagers on any draw for the rest of this round as all players&#x27; wagers on this rank have now been lost). The banker continues in this manner, drawing a players’ (winning) card, then a bank’s (losing) card, calling out the values and resolving wagers.

If a rank is revealed as both the players&#x27; and the bank&#x27;s (twins, a tie) the draw is null and no wagers (or parlays) are lost or paid. However, if a rank is drawn as the players&#x27; &quot;winning&quot; card twice in a row (including after a tie), it instead loses.

If a player&#x27;s wager wins, instead of accepting the payout (1:1), they may place a token (small die, coin, etc.) on a corner of a card to parlay (&quot;paroli&quot;) their bet. If this card wins again (before being drawn as the bank&#x27;s), the player wins an increased payout (see Parlay Table below). Instead of accepting this increased winning, the player may again refuse the payout to push their luck further by placing another token on a second corner. The player may continue in this manner on subsequent wins, either accepting the payout or continuing to parlay with tokens added to the card. If the deck runs out and the player still has a parlayed card on the table, that card must carry over into the next round until it either pays or loses. Any wager that has been parlayed may not be altered until it either wins or loses. If a parlayed card ever loses (drawn as the bank&#x27;s), the player only loses the original wager that was placed on the card regardless of any current parlay.

Alternatively, after a card wins (either for a 1:1 payout or after the payout of any parlay), the player may remove their card of that rank from play and place no more wagers on it. Or, the player may accept the payout (either 1:1 or after any successful parlay) and place the same wager as their original bet (or higher) on that same card as a new bet (&quot;masse&quot;) with any previous parlay tokens removed. 

The final card in the deck is null and pays nothing, no wagers (or parlays) are lost or paid. Players then prepare for the next round by placing new cards and wagers or removing others from the table. However, any standing parlays may not be removed or altered until the next round reveals whether they win or lose.

=== Paroli System ===
Sources differ on whether the first parlay pays 2:1 or is the &quot;sept-et-le-va&quot; of 7:1. Many sources, including Andrew Steinmetz&#x27;s 1870 work, source back to the ruleset described in the later editions of The Compleat Gamester. The second parlay is most commonly depicted as being the &quot;sept-et-le-va&quot;, per these rules. However, this would give a mathematical edge to the players with approximately a 25% chance to win 7 times their wager.

In all editions of The Compleat Gamester which include Basset, this issue is confused by the wording of the glossary. This includes that to achieve a &quot;soissant-et-le-va&quot; requires carrying the parlay into the next round, but not the &quot;trent-et-le-va&quot;. However, the same glossary describes the player adjusting the &quot;third corner&quot; of their card for a &quot;quinze-et-le-va&quot; and the &quot;fourth corner&quot; of their card for a &quot;trent-et-le-va&quot;. If the &quot;sept-et-le-va&quot; follows the original paroli, only one corner would have been adjusted, suggesting another parlay that is not well described. 

The glossary entry for &quot;The Pay&quot; in The Compleat Gamester mentions the doubling of the player&#x27;s wager if &quot;by this adventure Fortune favors him&quot; after having already established the 1:1 payout of whatever their first stake may be on their first win. This suggests a 2:1 payout that precedes the 7:1 &quot;sept-et-leva&quot;. This accounts for both the number of corners altered before the described &quot;quinze-et-le-va&quot; (the first being the 2:1, then the 7:1, and third the 15:1) and gives the mathematical edge to the bank for which the game of Basset is historically infamous. Additionally, this interpretation of the parlay system is more consistent in the use of odds as associated with other games of chance that include parlays.

===Variants===
The Compleat Gamester states that a &quot;masse&quot; is only permitted on winning cards. However, in Act IV of Susanna Centlivre&#x27;s 1705 comedy &quot;The Basset Table&quot; (in which the characters are playing Basset), losing cards are not removed from the table and players seem to be permitted to &quot;masse&quot; a further couch on them (as in Faro).

== Source Rules ==
The players sat round a table, the talliere (banker/dealer) in the midst of them, with the bank of gold before him, and the punters or players each having a book of 13 cards. Each laid down one, two, three, or more, as they pleased, with money upon them, as stakes. The talliere took the remaining pack in his hand and turned them up, with the bottom card appearing being called the fasse; he was then paid half the value of the stakes laid down by the punters upon any card of that sort (rank).

After the fasse was turned up, and the talliere and croupiere (bet collector, similar to a stickman) had looked round the cards on the table, and taken advantage of the money laid on them, the former proceeded with his deal; and the next card appearing, whether the king, queen, ace, or whatever it might be, won for the player (1–1 payout), the latter might receive it, or making paroli (parlay their bet), as before said, go on to sept-et-le-va (7–1 payout). The card after that won for the talliere, who took money from each player&#x27;s card of that sort, and brought it into his bank, an obvious and prodigious advantage over the players.

The talliere, if the winning card was a king, and the next after it was a ten, said (showing the cards all round): &#x27;King wins, ten loses,&#x27; paying the money to such cards and taking the money from those who lost, adding it to his bank. This done, he went on with the deal: &#x27;Ace wins, five loses; &#x27;Knave (Jack) wins, seven loses;&#x27; and so on, every other card alternately winning and losing, till all the pack was dealt but the last card. According to the rules of the game, the last card turned up was for the advantage of the talliere; although a player might have one of the same sort, still it was allowed to him as one of the dues of his office, he (the &quot;tallière&quot;) paid nothing on it.

The bold player who was lucky and adventurous, and could push on his couch with a considerable stake to &quot;sept-et-le-va&quot; (7–1 payout), &quot;quinze-et-le-va&quot; (15–1 payout), &quot;trente-et-le-va&quot; (33–1 payout), etc., must in a wonderful manner have multiplied his couch, or first stake up to &quot;soissante-et-le-va&quot; (67-1 payout); but this was seldom done; and the loss of the players, by the very nature of the game, invariably exceeded that of the bank; in fact, this game was altogether in favour of the bank; and yet it is evident that, in spite of this obvious conviction, the game must have been one of the most tempting and fascinating that was ever invented.

Suppose ten, or any other card wins for the punter, if another ten comes up just after in the winning card&#x27;s place, it does not win for him, but for the bank, but if it comes up three or four cards after that, it wins for the punter. For example, if ace or any other card wins at first, and afterwards come up again in the next winning card&#x27;s place, it does not go for the punters, but by a term they have for that part of the game is said to &quot;retire&quot;, till the next opportunity, because by the rule of the game it must go for the bank before the punter. But then in return of this, and subtly to gain the esteem of all the young adventurers who are apt to let their money briskly, if the same card happens to come in the next losing place (tie), it does not lose, because it has not gone for the punter but also retires without paying the bank, having won a couch, which the talliere saves, and should have paid.

===Frauds===
Of course there were frauds practiced at Basset by the talliere, or banker, in addition to his prescriptive advantages. The cards might be dealt so as not to allow the punter any winning throughout the pack; and it was in the power of the dealer to let the punter have as many winnings as he thought convenient.

===Glossary===
By 1870 the game as described in England used a mixture of French and English words and spellings:
*The &quot;tallière&quot; (banker), who laid down a sum of money to answer every winning card which might turn up.
*The &quot;croupière&quot; (assistant of the former), standing by to supervise the losing cards, so that when there were many at play, he might not lose by overlooking anything which might turn up to his profit.
*The punter: (in French, &quot;ponter&quot; – to bet), hence, each player.
*The &quot;fasse&quot;: the first card turned up by the tallière, by which he gained half the value of the money laid upon every card of that sort by the punters or players.
*The couch (from &quot;couche&quot;, stake): which was the first stake that each punter laid upon each card. Each player had a book of 13 cards before him, upon which he must lay his money.
*The &quot;paroli&quot; (probably from &quot;parole&quot;, to &quot;give your word&quot; - parlay the bet): whoever won the &quot;couch&quot;, and intended to go on for another advantage, crooked the corner of his card to indicate he would let his money lie, without being paid the value by the tallière.
*The &quot;masse&quot;: when those who had won the couch, would venture more money on the same card.
*The pay: when the player had won the couch, and, being doubtful of making the paroli, left off; for by going for the pay, if the card turned up wrong, he lost nothing, having won the couch before; but if by this adventure, fortune favoured him, he won double the money he had staked.
*The &quot;alpieu&quot;: when the &quot;couch&quot; was won by turning up, or crooking, the corner of the winning card.
*The &quot;sept-et-le-va&quot; (seven and the go): the first great chance that showed the advantages of the game, namely, if the player had won the couch, and then made a paroli by crooking the corner of his card, and going on to a second chance, if his winning card turned up again, it became a &quot;sept-et-le-va&quot;, which was seven times as much as he had laid upon his card.
*The &quot;quinze-et-le-va&quot; (fifteen and the go): attending the player&#x27;s humour, who, perhaps, was resolved to follow his fancy, and still lay his money upon the same card, which was done by crooking the third corner of his card. If this card came up by the dealing of the talliere, it made him win 15 times as much money as he staked.
*The &quot;trent-et-le-va&quot; (&quot;trente&quot; – thirty and the go): marked by the lucky player by crooking the end of the fourth corner of his card, which, coming up, made him win three and thirty (33) times as much money as he staked.
*The &quot;soissante-et-le-va&quot; (&quot;soixante&quot; -sixty and the go): is the highest and greatest chance that could happen in the game, for it paid sixty seven (67) times as much money as was staked. It was seldom won except by some player who pushed his good fortune to the utmost.

==Mathematical calculations==
Basset has been the object of mathematical calculations. Abraham de Moivre estimated the loss of the punter under any circumstance of cards remaining in the stock when he lays his stake, and of any number of times that his card is repeated in the stock. De Moivre created a table showing the several losses of the punter in whatsoever circumstances he may happen to be. From this table it appears:
#&quot;That the fewer the cards are in the stock, the greater is the loss of the punter.&quot;
#&quot;That the least loss of the punter, under the same circumstances of cards remaining in the stock, is when the card is but twice in it; the next greater when but three times; still greater when four times; and the greatest when but once. The gain of the banker upon all the money adventured at Basset is 15s 3d. per cent.&quot;

<text>Faro ( ), Pharaoh, Pharao, or Farobank is a late 17th-century French gambling game using cards. It is descended from Basset, and belongs to the Lansquenet and Monte Bank family of games due to the use of a banker and several players. Winning or losing occurs when cards turned up by the banker match those already exposed.

It is not a direct relative of poker, but Faro was often just as popular due to its fast action, easy-to-learn rules, and better odds than most games of chance. The game of Faro is played with only one deck of cards and admits any number of players.

Popular in North America during the 19th century, Faro was eventually overtaken by poker as the preferred card game of gamblers in the early 20th century.

Variants include German Faro, Jewish Faro, and Ladies&#x27; Faro.

==History==
The earliest references to a card game named &quot;Pharaon&quot; (French for &quot;Pharaoh&quot;) are found in Southwestern France during the reign of Louis XIV. Basset was outlawed in 1691, and Pharaoh emerged several years later as a derivative of Basset, before it too was outlawed.

After the French ban, Pharaoh and Basset continued to be widely played in England during the 18th century, where it was known as &quot;Pharo&quot;, an English alternate spelling of &quot;Pharaoh&quot;. The game was easy to learn, quick, and when played honestly, the odds for a player were considered by some to be the best of all gambling games, as Gilly Williams records in a letter to George Selwyn in 1752.

With its name shortened to &quot;Faro&quot;, it spread to the United States in the 19th century to become the most widespread and popularly favored gambling game. It was played in almost every gambling hall in the Old West from 1825 to 1915. Faro could be played in over 150 places in Washington, D.C. alone during the American Civil War. An 1882 study considered faro to be the most popular form of gambling, surpassing all others forms combined in terms of money wagered each year.

It was also widespread in the German states during the 19th century, where it was known as &quot;Pharao&quot; or &quot;Pharo&quot;. A simplified version played with 32 German-suited cards was known as &quot;Deutsches Pharao&quot; (&quot;German Pharo&quot;) or &quot;Süßmilch&quot; (&quot;Sweet Milk&quot;). It is recorded in card game compendia from at least 1810 to 1975. In Low German the game was also referred to as Pitje-Patje (= &quot;money&quot; + &quot;small heaps&quot;).

In the US, Faro was also called &quot;bucking the tiger&quot; or &quot;twisting the tiger&#x27;s tail&quot;, a reference to early card backs that featured a drawing of a Bengal tiger. By the mid 19th century, the tiger was so commonly associated with the game that gambling districts where faro was popular became known as &quot;tiger town&quot;, or in the case of smaller venues, &quot;tiger alley&quot;. Some gambling houses would simply hang a picture of a tiger in their windows to advertise that a game could be played there.

Faro&#x27;s detractors regarded it as a dangerous scam that destroyed families and reduced men to poverty because of rampant rigging of the dealing box. Crooked faro equipment was so popular that many sporting-house companies began to supply &quot;gaffed&quot; dealing boxes specially designed so that the bankers could cheat their players; methods of cheating in faro are detailed below. Cheating was so prevalent that editions of &quot;Hoyle&#x27;s Rules of Games&quot; began their faro section by warning readers that not a single honest faro bank could be found in the United States. Criminal prosecutions of faro were involved in the Supreme Court cases of &quot;United States v. Simms&quot;, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 252 (1803), and &quot;Ex parte Milburn&quot;, 34 U.S. (9 Pet.) 704 (1835).

Although the game became scarce after World War II, it continued to be played at a few Las Vegas and Reno casinos through 1985.

===Etymology===

Historians have suggested that the name &quot;Pharaon&quot; comes from Louis XIV&#x27;s royal gamblers, who chose the name from the motif that commonly adorned one of the French-made court cards.

==Rules==

===Description===

A game of faro was often called a &quot;faro bank&quot;. It was played with an entire deck of playing cards. One person was designated the &quot;banker&quot; and an indeterminate number of players, known as &quot;punters&quot;, could be admitted. Chips (called &quot;checks&quot;) were purchased by the punter from the banker (or house) from which the game originated. Bet values and limits were set by the house. Usual check values in the US were 50 cents to $10 each.

The faro table was typically oval, covered with green baize, and had a cutout for the banker. A board was placed on top of the table with one suit of cards (traditionally spades) pasted to it in numerical order, representing a standardized betting &quot;layout&quot;. Each player laid his stake on one of the 13 cards on the layout. Players could place multiple bets and could bet on multiple cards simultaneously by placing their bet between cards or on specific card edges. A player could reverse the intent of his bet by placing a hexagonal (6-sided) token called a &quot;copper&quot; on it. Some histories said a penny was sometimes used in place of a copper. This was known as &quot;coppering&quot; the bet, and reversed the meaning of the win/loss piles for that particular bet. Players also had the choice of betting on the &quot;high card&quot; bar located at the top of the layout.

===Procedure===
* A deck of cards was shuffled and placed inside a &quot;dealing box&quot;, a mechanical device also known as a &quot;shoe&quot;, which was used to prevent manipulations of the draw by the banker and intended to assure players of a fair game.
* The first card in the dealing box was called the &quot;soda&quot; and was &quot;burned off&quot;, leaving 51 cards in play. The dealer then drew two cards: the first was called the &quot;banker&#x27;s card&quot; and was placed on the right side of the dealing box. The next card after the banker&#x27;s card was called the &quot;carte anglaise&quot; (English card) or simply the &quot;player&#x27;s card&quot;, and it was placed on the left of the shoe.
* The banker&#x27;s card was the bettor&#x27;s &quot;losing card&quot;; regardless of its suit, all bets placed on the layout&#x27;s card that had the same denomination as the banker&#x27;s card were lost by the players and won by the bank. The player&#x27;s card was the &quot;winning card&quot;. All bets placed on the card that had that denomination were returned to the players with a 1 to 1 (even money) payout by the bank (e.g., a dollar bet won a dollar). A &quot;high card&quot; bet won if the player&#x27;s card had a higher value than the banker&#x27;s card.
* The dealer settled all bets after each two cards drawn. This allowed players to bet before drawing the next two cards. Bets that neither won nor lost remained on the table, and could be picked up or changed by the player prior to the next draw.
* When only three cards remained in the dealing box, the dealer would &quot;call the turn&quot;, which was a special type of bet that occurred at the end of each round. The object now was to predict the exact order that the three remaining cards, Bankers, Players, and the final card called the Hock, would be drawn. The player&#x27;s odds here were 5 to 1, while a successful bet paid off at 4 to 1 (or 1 to 1 if there were a pair among the three, known as a &quot;cat-hop&quot;). This provided one of the dealer&#x27;s few advantages in faro. If it happened that the three remaining cards were all the same, there would be no final bet, as the outcome was not in question.

Certain advantages were reserved to the banker: if he drew a doublet, that is, two equal cards, he won half of the stakes upon the card which equaled the doublet. In a fair game, this provided the only &quot;house edge&quot;. If the banker drew the last card of the pack, he was exempt from doubling the stakes deposited on that card. These and the advantage from the odds on the turn bet provided a slight financial advantage to the dealer or house.

A device, called a &quot;casekeep&quot; was employed to assist the players and prevent dealer cheating by counting cards. The casekeep resembled an abacus, with one spindle for each card denomination, with four counters on each spindle. As a card was played, either winning or losing, one of four counters would be moved to indicate that a card of that denomination had been played. This allowed players to plan their bets by keeping track of what cards remained available in the dealing box. The operator of the case keep is called the &quot;casekeeper&quot; or, colloquially in the American West, the &quot;coffin driver&quot;.

==Cheating==

To give themselves more of an advantage, and to counter the losses from players cheating, dealers would also often cheat. In a fair game the house&#x27;s edge was low, so dealers increasingly resorted to cheating the players to increase the profitability of the game for the house. This, too, was acknowledged by &quot;Hoyle&quot; editors when describing how faro banks were opened and operated: &quot;To justify the initial expenditure, a dealer must have some permanent advantage.&quot;

=== By dealers ===
Dealers employed several methods of cheating:
* Stacked or rigged decks: A stacked deck would consist of many paired cards, allowing the dealer to claim half of the bets on that card, as per the rules. A rigged deck would contain textured cards that allowed dealers to create paired cards in the deck while giving the illusion of thorough shuffling.
* Rigged dealing boxes: Rigged, or &quot;gaffed&quot;, dealing boxes came in several variants. Typically, they allowed the dealer to see the next card prior to the deal, by use of a small mirror or prism visible only to the dealer. If the next card was heavily bet, the box could also allow the dealer to draw two cards in one draw, thus hiding the card that would have paid. This would result in the casekeep not accounting for the hidden card, however. If the casekeeper were employed by the house, though, he could take the blame for &quot;accidentally&quot; not logging that card when it was drawn.
* Sleight of hand: In concert with the rigged dealing box, the dealer could, when he knew the next card to win, surreptitiously slide a player&#x27;s bet off of the winning card if it was on the dealer&#x27;s side of the layout. At a hectic faro table he could often get away with this, though it was obviously a risky move.

===By players===
Players would routinely cheat as well. Their techniques employed distraction and sleight-of-hand, and usually involved moving their stake to a winning card, or at the very least off the losing card, without being detected. Their methods ranged from crude to creative, and worked best at a busy, fast-paced table:
* Simple move of their bet: The most basic cheat was simply to move one&#x27;s bet to the adjacent card on the layout while avoiding the banker noticing. While the simplest, it also carried the greatest risk of detection.
* Moving with a thread: A silk thread or single horse hair would be affixed to the bottom check in the bet, and allowed the stack to be pulled across the table to another card on the layout. This was less risky, as the cheating player would not have to make an overt action.
* Removing the copper: A variant on the use of the thread was to affix it to the copper token used to reverse the bet. If the losing card matched the player&#x27;s bet, the copper made it a winning bet and no cheat was needed. If, however, the winning card, dealt second, were to match the player&#x27;s bet the copper would ordinarily make it a loser, but quickly snatching the copper from the stack with the invisible thread turned it into a winner. This held the least risk, as once the copper was yanked from the stack, there was no thread left attached to the bet.
Being caught cheating often resulted in a fight, or even gunfire.

==In culture==

===Etymology===
* The old phrase &quot;from soda to hock&quot;, meaning &quot;from beginning to end&quot; derives from the first and last cards dealt in a round of faro. The phrase evolved from the better known &quot;&quot;. In turn, &quot;soda&quot; and &quot;hock&quot; are probably themselves derived from &quot;hock and soda&quot;, a popular nineteenth-century drink consisting of hock (a sweet German wine) combined with soda water.

* The town of Faro, Yukon, Canada was named after the game.

<text>Hazard is an early English game played with two dice; it was mentioned in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; in the 14th century.

Despite its complicated rules, hazard was very popular in the 17th and 18th centuries and was often played for money. At Crockford&#x27;s Club in London, hazard was especially popular. In the 19th century, the game craps developed from hazard through a simplification of the rules. Craps is now popular in North America but neither game remains popular within the rest of the world.

==Rules==
Any number may play, but only one player – the caster – has the dice at any time.

In each round, the caster specifies a number between 5 and 9 inclusive: this is the main. They then throw two dice.
* If they roll the main, they win (throwing in or nicking).
* If they roll a 2 or a 3, they lose (throwing out or outing).
* If they roll an 11 or 12, the result depends on the main:
** with a main of 5 or 9, they throw out with both an 11 and a 12;
** with a main of 6 or 8, they throw out with an 11 but nick with a 12;
** with a main of 7, they nick with an 11 but throw out with a 12.
* If they neither nick nor throw out, the number thrown is called the chance. They throw the dice again:
** if they roll the chance, they win;
** if they roll the main, they lose (unlike on the first throw);
** if they roll neither, they keep throwing until they roll one or the other, winning with the chance and losing with the main.

The caster keeps their role until losing three times in succession. After the third loss, they must pass the dice to the left, that player becoming the new caster.

==Betting==
Bets are between the caster and the bank (the setter), which may be the remaining players acting as a group.

If the caster nicks on the first throw, they win an amount equal to their stake. After the first throw, the caster wins their stake if they get their chance before their main.

After the first throw, the caster (and others, via side bets) may wager an additional sum that the chance will come before the main. These bets are made at odds determined by the relative proportions of the main and the chance.

For example, there are six possible rolls (out of 36 total combinations with two dice) that add up to 7: 1-6, 2-5, 3-4, 4-3, 5-2, and 6-1; in comparison, there are only four possible rolls that add up to 5: 1-4, 2-3, 3-2, and 4-1. The relative proportion of the probabilities with a main of 7 and a chance of 5 is which is or, simplified, . Assuming an odds stake of £10, a caster stands to win £15 ( × £10) with a main of 7 and a chance of 5; with the same stake, a main of 5 and a chance of 6, they could win £8 ( × £10).

==Probability of winning==
For each main the probability of winning can be calculated:
In some reports on the rules of the game, the main is determined randomly by tossing the dice until a valid main appears. In this case, the overall player disadvantage is 1.84%. 

If the caster can choose a main, they should always choose 7 (resulting in the lowest disadvantage, with 1.41%). This is the origin of a similar dice game, craps, since if 7 is always chosen, the game is played under the rules of craps.

==Etymology and history==
The name &quot;hazard&quot; is borrowed from Old French. The origin of the French word is unclear, but probably derives from Spanish &quot;azar&quot; (&quot;an unfortunate card or dice roll&quot;), with the final -d by analogy with the common French suffix &quot;-ard&quot;. The Spanish word has been supposed in turn to come from Arabic, either from the name of a castle in Palestine, or from the word &quot;az-zahr&quot; (الزهر) meaning &quot;dice&quot;. However, early evidence for this word in Arabic is lacking, as it is absent from Classical Arabic dictionaries, making the etymology doubtful (although any other source is unknown). Another possibility is Arabic &quot;yasara&quot; (&quot;he played at dice&quot;).

According to William of Tyre, the game was invented by Crusaders during the siege of Hazart (Azaz), but this origin has been called into question. The game was popular in 17th century England, as described by Charles Cotton in &quot;The Compleat Gamester&quot; (1674): &quot;Certainly &quot;Hazzard&quot; is the most bewitching Game that is plaid on the Dice; for when a man begins to play he knows not when to leave off; and having once accustom&#x27;d himself to play at &quot;Hazzard&quot; he hardly ever after minds anything else.&quot; By that time, the game had already been brought to the Colony of Virginia, as a law barring ministers from playing dice was passed in 1624. The rules including relative odds for side wagers were largely complete by 1790, as published in &quot;Hoyle&#x27;s Games, Improved&quot;.

It was brought to France some time before 1792, when it was described in the &quot;Encyclopédie Méthodique&quot; as &quot;Krabs&quot;, after the English term crabs, referring to the roll combination of 2 or 3. This was corrupted to &quot;craps&quot; by 1818, as it was named in &quot;Bibliothèque Historique&quot;, although the rules of that game described at that time were identical to those of Hazard.

==Derivations from Hazard==
From the game of Hazard came the modern terms:

* Possibly, the phrase &quot;at sixes and sevens&quot; (another possible derivation is discussed under that article). &quot;Set upon six and seven&quot; first appeared in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Tales&quot; relating to betting one&#x27;s entire fortune on a single throw of the dice. Over time the phrase became associated with any circumstances involving general confusion or disorder.
* The word &quot;hazard&quot; in its modern sense of &quot;risk&quot; or &quot;danger&quot;.
* &quot;An eye for (on / to) the main chance&quot;: habitually looking for opportunities to take advantage of a situation for personal gain, especially financial gain.

<text>Passe-dix, also called passage in English, is a game of chance using dice.

==Gameplay==
It was described by Charles Cotton in &quot;The Compleat Gamester&quot; (1674) thus:

Andrew Steinmetz, in &quot;The Gaming Table: Its Votaries and Victims&quot;, described it at greater length but somewhat ambiguously (the results of rolling a 10 are unclear, depending on whether it wins for the bank or is a push, the house advantage is at best 0, and at worst negative):

==In Germany==
In southern Germany, playing passe-dix (or &quot;Paschen&quot;) is a New Year&#x27;s Eve tradition, which dates to the Late Middle Ages.

The rules of Paschen vary, but the following account, found in the 1896 Brockhaus Konversationslexikon is typical. The banker first wagers an ante, known as the &quot;banco&quot;. The punters either place their own bets, the sum of which must equal the banco, or one punter goes alone and wagers a stake equal to the banco themselves before the banker rolls three dice. If the sum of the dice is eleven or higher, then the &quot;banker&quot; wins; if the sum is between 3 and 10, the punters win by a ratio of 1:1. It is typical for the role of the banker to pass to their right-hand neighbour on a loss. Another typical rule is that the banker must re-roll if triples of any number are rolled.

In the present, it is common for wins to be pooled, and for sweet pastries to be bought with them and eaten by the entire party.

<text>Limavady (; ) is a market town in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, with Binevenagh as a backdrop. Lying east of Derry and southwest of Coleraine, Limavady had a population of 11,279 people at the 2021 Census. In the 40 years between 1971 and 2011, Limavady&#x27;s population nearly doubled. Limavady is within Causeway Coast and Glens Borough.

From 1988 to 2004, a total of 1,332 dwellings were built in the town, mainly at Bovally along the southeastern edge of the town. The large industrial estate at Aghanloo is 2 miles (3 km) north of the town.

== History ==

Limavady and its surrounding settlements derive from Celtic roots, although no-one is sure about the exact date of Limavady&#x27;s origins. Estimates date from around 5 CE. Early records tell of Saint Columba, who presided over a meeting of the Kings at Mullagh Hill near Limavady in 575 CE, a location which is now part of the Roe Park Resort.

Gaelic Ireland was divided into kingdoms, each ruled by its own family or clan. In the Limavady area, the predominant family was the O&#x27;Cahans. Their mark is found everywhere in the town and surrounding area. O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s Rock is one of Limavady&#x27;s main historical points. This is where, according to local myth, a dog belonging to one of the Chiefs jumped the river to get help from nearby clans after a surprise enemy attack. This gave Limavady its name, Limavady being the anglicised version of &quot;Leim an Mhadaidh&quot;, which means leap of the dog. This rock, along with other relics of Limavady&#x27;s history, can be seen at Roe Valley Country Park.

The town developed from a small Plantation settlement founded by Sir Thomas Phillips. In 1610 Sir Thomas Phillips was granted 13,100 acres of land at Limavady which included an O’Cahan castle. He commenced the building of the &#x27;Newtown of Limavady&#x27; which was laid out in a cruciform road pattern. Newtown Limavady was incorporated, with the appointment of a Provost and 12 Burgesses, on 31 March 1613 with a charter granted by King James I. By 1622, 18 one-storey houses and an inn had been built and they were centred on the crossroads which contained a flagpole, a cross and stocks.

Limavady had an early association with the linen and Irish whiskey industries. In 1608, a licence was granted to Sir Thomas Phillips by King James I to distil whiskey.

for the next seven years, within the countie of Colrane, otherwise called O Cahanes countrey, or within the territorie called Rowte, in County Antrim, by himselfe or his servauntes, to make, drawe, and distil such and soe great quantities of aquavite, usquabagh and aqua composita, as he or his assignes shall thinke fitt; and the same to sell, vent, and dispose of to any persons, yeeldinge yerelie the somme 13s 4d...

The Limavady Distillery was founded in 1750 on the banks of the River Roe. Limavady, however, did not benefit from subsequent expansion of linen manufacturing in the 19th century. As a result, it remained a modest sized market town until the late 20th century. Limavady Town Hall, later known as the Alexander Memorial Hall and now part of the Roe Valley Arts &amp; Cultural Centre, was completed in 1872.

In 1941 RAF Limavady, a base for air patrols over the Atlantic during World War II, was opened just to the north of the town. The RAF left the base in 1945 but it continued as a naval air station until 1958, when the land was returned to agricultural use.

During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, four people were killed in or near Limavady by the Provisional Irish Republican Army. Two were members of the security forces and two were civilians who were killed by a bomb as they drove past Limavady Royal Ulster Constabulary station.
In 1987, Limavady became famous as the unintended arrival point for the world&#x27;s first transatlantic hot air balloon crossing by Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand.

== Townlands ==
Limavady sprang up within the townland of Rathbrady Beg in the parish of Drumachose and was originally known as Newtown Limavady. Over time, the urban area has expanded into the surrounding townlands. These include:
* Bovally ()
* Coolessan ()
* Enagh ()
* Killane ()
* Rathbrady Beg ()
* Rathbrady More ()

== Politics ==
Limavady is in both the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council area and the East Londonderry constituency for elections to the Westminster Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly. In 2023, the residents of Limavady district elected 2 Democratic Unionist Party, 1 Social Democratic and Labour Party, 1 Sinn Féin and 1 Alliance Party councillor to the borough council.

== Places of interest ==
* Limavady lies in the scenic Roe Valley area and the Roe Valley Country Park on the River Roe lies to the southwest of the town.
* The birthplace of New Zealand Prime Minister Rt. Hon. William Massey is on Irish Green Street. Nearby Massey Avenue is named after him.
* The archaeologically significant Broighter Gold collection was found nearby in 1896. It is currently in the National Museum in Dublin.
* Jane Ross, who first transcribed Londonderry Air, was born and lived in Limavady. A plaque is shown above her old house on Main Street.

==Popular culture==

===Danny Boy===
Limavady is most famous for the tune &quot;Londonderry Air&quot; collected by Jane Ross in the mid-19th century from a local fiddle player. The tune was later (ca. 1913) used for the song &quot;Danny Boy&quot;.

===Events===
The town hosts events such as the NI Super Cup, the Danny Boy Jazz and Blues Festival, the Roe Valley Folk Festival the Stendhal Festival of Art, and the Bishop Hervey International Summer School.

== Transport ==
Limavady is in close proximity to City of Derry Airport, 9 miles (15 km) to the west, and the Port of Londonderry, 13 miles (22 km) to the west.

===Road===
In 2003 a road bypass was completed to the north of Limavady at a cost of £11.5 million. This bypass aimed to reduce the time taken to travel on the A2 between Derry and Coleraine.

===Rail===
The Limavady Railway was a branch line to the main Belfast–Derry line. Limavady railway station opened on 29 December 1852, closed for passenger traffic on 3 July 1950 and finally closed altogether on 2 May 1955. Nowadays it is the site of the bus station, which Ulsterbus occupies. Limavady Junction railway station opened on 1 March 1855 and finally closed on 17 October 1976. Limavady is no longer served by the branch line – the nearest station is at Bellarena, approximately from the town.

Bellarena railway station has direct trains west to Derry~Londonderry and east to Castlerock, Coleraine (for stations to ), and stations to Belfast Lanyon Place and Belfast Grand Central.

An All-Island Review on railways commissioned in 2021 recommended that a short spur of the Limavady branch line be reinstated up to Limavady to restore services.

===Canal===
The Broharris Canal was constructed in the 1820s when a cut, some long on the south shore of Lough Foyle near Ballykelly was made in the direction of Limavady. The inhabitants of Limavady appealed for the building of a canal from Lough Foyle to the town but were turned down, and the Broharris Canal was the nearest they came to achieving such a navigable link.

== Education ==
There are four primary schools, three secondary schools, a regional college and a special needs school in Limavady. Limavady&#x27;s schools are closely located in an &#x27;education circle&#x27;. The three secondary schools are all located along the same stretch of road (Ballyquin Road and Irish Green Street), with Rossmar Special School opposite Limavady Grammar School, Termoncanice Primary opposite Limavady High School and St. Mary&#x27;s High School. Limavady Central Primary School is located a short distance from the other schools.

<text>The London College of Communication is a constituent college of the University of the Arts London. Its origins are in education for the printing and retail industries; it now specialises in media-related subjects including advertising, animation, film, graphic design, photography and sound arts. 

It has approximately 5,000 students, and offers about sixty courses at foundation, undergraduate and postgraduate level. It is organised in three schools: media, design and screen; all are housed in a single building in Elephant and Castle. It received its present name in 2004; it was previously the London School of Printing and Graphic Arts, then the London College of Printing, and briefly the London College of Printing and Distributive Trades.

== History ==

The school was formed in 1990 by the merger of the College for Distributive Trades with the London College of Printing.

The London College of Printing descended from the St Bride&#x27;s Foundation Institute Printing School, which was established in November 1894 under the City of London Parochial Charities Act of 1883. The Guild and Technical School opened in Clerkenwell in the same year, but moved a year later to Bolt Court, and became the Bolt Court Technical School; it was later renamed the London County Council School of Photoengraving and Lithography. 

Annual portfolios of student work were assembled during the years that the printing school was administered by St Bride Foundation. These, and other early documentation, form part of the permanent collections at St Bride Printing Library. 

St Bride&#x27;s came under the control of the London County Council in 1922 and was renamed the London School of Printing and Kindred Trades; in 1949 it was merged with the LCC School of Photoengraving and Lithography, forming the London School of Printing and Graphic Arts. In 1960 this was renamed the London College of Printing. The printing department of the North Western Polytechnic was merged into it in 1969. The London College of Printing became part of the London Institute in 1986.

The Westminster Day Continuation School opened in 1921, and was later renamed the College for Distributive Trades, providing practical education relating to retail, and later to the related area of marketing. It too became part of the London Institute in 1986. In 1990 it merged with the London College of Printing to form the London College of Printing and Distributive Trades, which in 1996 was renamed the London College of Communication.

In 2003 the London Institute received Privy Council approval for university status, and in 2004 was renamed University of the Arts London.

== Cutbacks and closures ==

LCC had student protests and sit-ins in November 2009, as students expressed anger over proposed course closures and staff redundancies. About 100 students tried to occupy the office of Sandra Kemp, the head of the college at that time, in protest over the lack of supervision for dissertations. Students later occupied a lecture theatre and private security guards tried to remove protesting students. This failed when a member of academic staff questioned their right to touch the students and police were summoned who prevailed upon the protesters to leave the building. Several students faced disciplinary action, including suspension.

The director of the university&#x27;s course in public relations resigned over the proposed cutbacks, saying that there weren&#x27;t enough staff. Much of the teaching was then supplied by sessional lecturers on short-term contracts. A member of the teaching staff said that sackings resulted in cancelled lectures and students left without dissertation supervisors.

In 2011 an inquiry by the Quality Assurance Agency into restructuring at the LCC found standards were so badly affected by course closures that the marks of some students were raised to compensate. The report followed complaints by students relating to the restructuring, including claims that quality had been &#x27;severely compromised&#x27; and that those studying were not informed of the plans before enrolment. The investigation was the first of its kind and is the QAA&#x27;s revised “whistleblower” process for investigating concerns about academic standards and quality. The decision to investigate the complaints followed the closure of 16 courses and 26 full-time redundancies.

== Alumni ==

Among the alumni of the college are Rebekah Brooks, former chief executive of News International; Jane Root, former controller of BBC Two; the advertising executive and art collector Charles Saatchi; graphic designer and typographer Neville Brody and the cartoonist and illustrator Ralph Steadman.

<text>Newcastle is a small seaside resort town in County Down, Northern Ireland, which had a population of 8,298 at the 2021 Census. It lies by the Irish Sea at the foot of Slieve Donard, the highest of the Mourne Mountains. Newcastle is known for its sandy beach, forests (Donard Forest and Tollymore Forest Park), and mountains. The town lies within the Newry, Mourne and Down District.

The town aims to promote itself as the &quot;activity resort&quot; for Northern Ireland. It has benefited from a multi-million pound upgrade to the promenade and main street. The town is twinned with New Ross, County Wexford, in the Republic of Ireland.

== History ==
The name of the town is thought to derive from the castle built by Felix Magennis of the Magennis clan in 1588, which stood at the mouth of the Shimna River. This castle was demolished in 1830. The town is referred to as New Castle in the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; in 1433, so it is likely that he built on the site of an existing structure.

The Montgomery Manuscripts record that Newcastle was besieged and later captured by Sir James Montgomery of the Ards in April 1642 in the aftermath of the 1641 Rebellion (pp. 128–134). Prior to 1641 the Castle belonged to the Magennis&#x27;, but after the rebellion the property was confiscated and granted to Robert Hawkins, great grandfather to Robert Hawkins who assumed the surname of Magill. The date 1588 was inscribed on a stone placed over the front entrance of the Castle, built by Felix Magenis. Newcastle passed from the Magills to the Mathews, and subsequently to the Annesleys. In the late 1700s the Castle was modernised by the Matthews and then the Annesleys, and rented by the Board of Customs for the accommodation of revenue officers. Around 1830 the castle was demolished and the &#x27;Annesley Arms Hotel&#x27; was constructed within the original castle compound. The 3rd Earl Annesley built a new &#x27;marine residence&#x27;, called &#x27;Donard Lodge&#x27; on the lower mountain slope above the town (it was demolished in 1966). St. John&#x27;s Church was also opened on &#x27;The Rock&#x27; in 1832 to accommodate the visitors and growing population in Earl Annesley&#x27;s developing seaside resort.

The Newcastle fishing disaster occurred on 13 January 1843 when boats from Newcastle and Annalong set out for the usual fishing stations, and were caught in a gale. 14 boats were lost in the heavy seas including a boat which had gone to the rescue. Only two boats survived, the &quot;Victoria&quot; and the &quot;Brothers&quot;. 73 men perished, 46 of whom were from Newcastle. They left twenty-seven widows, one hundred and eighteen children, and twenty-one dependents. A public subscription was raised and the cottages, known as Widows Row, were built for the widows and dependents. A local song about the disaster says &quot;Newcastle town is one long street entirely stripped of men&quot;

In 1910 Harry Ferguson flew a small plane across Newcastle beach in one of the first engine powered flights by aircraft in Ireland. He completed the flight in an attempt to win a £100 prize offered by the town for the first powered flight along the strand. His first take off ended badly, but according to a modern newspaper report &#x27;He flew a distance of almost three miles along the foreshore at a low altitude varying between fifty and five hundred feet&#x27;. This event is recorded by a plaque on the promenade.

Information on the town&#x27;s history is available on signs throughout the forests and hills. The Mourne Mountains is the setting for many local myths and legends. There are stories of &#x27;The Blue Lady&#x27;, a woman abandoned by her husband whose ghost still haunts the mountains, and more recently the idea of a wild cat living in the Mournes. Many of the stories although have true origins are only folklore and give many of the towns attractions their names, such as Maggie&#x27;s Leap being named after a local girl called Maggie, who leapt over the impressive chasm to her death while fleeing soldiers with a basket of eggs. Many other places in the Newcastle area get their names from other sources, &#x27;The Brandy Pad&#x27;, a path through the mountains, is named so because of the illegal brandy smuggling that took place through the area. Another example is Bogey Hill just above the harbour at the Southern end of the town, which is named after the carts that carried Mourne granite from the quarry on Thomas Mountain down to the harbour. In 1897, T.R.H. The Duke and Duchess of York (the future George V and Queen Mary), grandparents to Queen Elizabeth II, visited Newcastle to open the Slieve Donard Hotel. Afterwards they visited Hugh Annesley, 5th Earl Annesley at Castlewellan Castle.

A process of preserving the local history has begun since 2014 via a community Facebook page &#x27;History of Newcastle, Co. Down&#x27;. Photographs and information on the area&#x27;s history are being collected via the page, and a history of the town will be published. Greater historical detail about the town will be added to this page as part of this research process. It is hoped that this collective history will enhance the experience of both locals and tourists by promoting an informed historical appreciation for the area.

Newcastle was fortunate enough to escape the worst of the Troubles and its residents both Catholic and Protestant lived in relative peace with each other though there has been considerable objection to loyalist band parades in the town.

==Climate==
== Tourism ==

Newcastle is a popular seaside resort and attracts visitors from elsewhere in Ireland and from overseas. In 2006, the new promenade won a number of National awards including a Civic Trust Award for Excellence in the Public Realm. In recent years, the town has started a large Halloween festival, with a carnival-like atmosphere. The free event includes fireworks and a fancy dress competition. The crime rate in Newcastle remains relatively low, although there is a stronger police presence during peak holiday periods due to the increase in petty crimes.

Newcastle is close to Northern Ireland&#x27;s highest mountain, Slieve Donard, which is nearby in the Mourne mountain range. Visitors come to walk in the Mourne Mountains, made famous by the song by Percy French. Another popular attraction in the town is Royal County Down Golf Club (venue for the 2007 Walker Cup and 2015 Irish Open), now recognised as the no.1 golf course in the world, and is said to be one of Tiger Woods&#x27; favourite golf courses. The town is also known for Mourne Granite, which was quarried here for many years and shipped all round the world. It was used to make paving stones in many cities including London and New York. Mourne granite was used to make the base of the 9/11 memorial in New York.

Since 2010, Newcastle has held an annual &#x27;Festival of Flight&#x27; airshow which attracts upwards of 100,000 people to the event. The RAF Red Arrows are usually the star attraction of the show which is heavily supported by both the RAF and Irish Air Corps as well as the Irish Coast Guard. Many of the UK&#x27;s top civilian air displays have also visited Newcastle on a regular basis.

===Places of interest===


* The Mourne Mountains lie south of the town and the local area includes the Tollymore Forest Park and Donard Park. The Shimna River flows through Tollymore Park and enters the sea at Newcastle.
* The Murlough Nature Reserve is situated between Dundrum and Newcastle. The rugged sand dunes and beach are National Trust property.
* Slidderyford Dolmen is a neolithic portal tomb located near the entrance to Murlough Nature Reserve. It is composed of four stones, two granite and two slate.
* Saint Patrick&#x27;s Stream – in popular mythology, the Mourne Mountains was the site where Saint Patrick banished the &#x27;snakes&#x27; from Ireland, and that in his first landings to Ireland he visited the Mournes and even converted the local hill folk to Christianity. The small stream is said to mark the boundary of the Kingdom of Mourne and legend has it that there is a rock in the stream with his hand print in it where he knelt down to drink the water.
* Newcastle Harbour – In 1820, Lord Annesley created a pier as a loading point for the famous Mourne granite.
* The Bloody Bridge – The bridge and the Bloody Bridge River, were so named because of an incident during the 1641 Rebellion, during which a massacre of Protestants took place. The bridge is sometimes visited by tourists who go to see the &#x27;Brandy Pad&#x27;, called after the trade of illegal brandy which was smuggled down this route and from there onwards at the dead of night to Hilltown. The remains of an ancient church and the old bridge which once carried the coast road can still be seen.
* Widows Row. A set of listed cottages just south of the harbour, built by public subscription after the Newcastle Fishing disaster of 1843.

==Education==
There is one post-primary school in Newcastle, Shimna Integrated College, founded in 1994 as an all-ability, non-selective, 11-18 school. There are four primary schools. St. Mary&#x27;s Primary School was formerly St. Mary&#x27;s Boys Primary School and St. Mary&#x27;s Girls Primary School. The school became mixed in September 2001 but remained split over the two sites, younger children at one and older children at the other until recent years. A new building, large enough to support all the students has since been built. All Children&#x27;s Primary School was founded in 1986 and was the first primary school outside Belfast that was fully religiously integrated. The other two schools are Newcastle Primary School, founded in 1962, and St. Joseph&#x27;s Primary School, founded in 1838. There is also a Technical College in the town.

<text>Newtownards (; ) is a town in County Down, Northern Ireland. It lies at the most northern tip of Strangford Lough, 10 miles (16 km) east of Belfast, on the Ards Peninsula. It is in the civil parish of Newtownards and the historic baronies of Ards Lower and Castlereagh Lower. Newtownards is in the Ards and North Down Borough. The population was 29,677 in the 2021 Census.

==History==

===Irish settlement===
In 540 AD, St. Finian founded Movilla Abbey, a monastery, on a hill overlooking Strangford Lough about a mile northeast of present-day Newtownards town centre. &quot;Movilla&quot; (&quot;Magh Bhile&quot;) means &quot;the plain of the sacred tree&quot; in Irish, which suggests that the land had previously been a sacred pagan site. It became a significant Christian settlement – a centre for worship, study, mission and commercial trade, well known throughout Ireland. It was sacked by the Vikings sometime after AD 824, though survived for a thousand years as a monastic settlement (becoming part of the Augustinian Order in 1135), until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1542.

The Normans conquered east Ulster in the 1170s, founding the Earldom of Ulster. Around 1226, they established a new town around Movilla, which became known as the &quot;New Town of Blathewic&quot;, after the Irish territory of Uí Blathmhaic. A Dominican priory was built in 1244 by Walter de Burgh and was also dissolved in 1542.

In 1572, both monasteries were burned by the Clannaboy O&#x27;Neills under Sir Brian McPhelim O&#x27;Neill to deny buildings to the English, who were attempting to colonize the Ards. After this the urban settlement at Movilla disappeared and the area around it became known as &quot;Ballylisnevin&quot; (&quot;the town of Nevin&#x27;s fort&quot;).

===The Scottish town===

In 1605 (prior to the official Plantation of Ulster in 1610), Hugh Montgomery was granted the lands and set about rebuilding what was by then known as &quot;Newtown&quot;, later expanded to &quot;Newtownards&quot;. Official records show the town was established in 1606. Montgomery built a residence in the ruins of the old priory, the tower of which remains. Scottish Protestant settlers, particularly from Ayr, and to a lesser extent Irvine, in Ayrshire, arrived in large numbers and the town grew quickly.

Due to the shallow mud of Strangford Lough, Newtown never developed as a port, with goods instead transported from the nearby town of Donaghadee on the Irish Sea coast of the Ards Peninsula. Instead, it became a market town, with the Market House in Conway Square constructed in 1771.

===United Irishmen rebellion===

North Down and the Ards were briefly held by United Irish insurgents in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. On the morning of 9 June, &quot;Pike Sunday&quot;, United Irishmen, mainly from Bangor, Donaghadee, Greyabbey and Ballywalter, under the command of the Presbyterian licentiate (later American diplomat) David Bailie Warden, marched on the town. They were driven off with musket fire from the Market House, but the garrison, consisting of troops from the York Fencible Regiment of Foot subsequently withdrew, allowing the rebels to establish a French revolutionary-style Committee of Public Safety. The &quot;Republic&quot; in Newtownards did not survive the rout two days later of the main rebel force at Ballynahinch.

===The Great Famine===
During the Great Famine, which resulted from the dependence of small tenants and cottiers on a blighted potato crop, the largest local landowner, Lord Londonderry, rejected rent reductions on grounds of &quot;personal inconvenience&quot;. By 1847 the 800 inhabitants of the town were witness to &quot;emaciated and half-famished souls&quot; queuing at soup kitchens and overflowing the newly built workhouse. Despite Lord Londonderry&#x27;s objection, with the upgrading of the road to Donaghadee several public works programs for famine relief were instigated. In general, conditions on the land, not as acutely subdivided as in western districts of Ireland, and the availability of weaving and other employments, saved the town from the worst.

===Victorian growth===
The early 19th century saw the reclamation of the marshlands south of the town. At the same time, its growth was accelerated by integration into the Belfast and Lagan Valley industrial region and market. The Belfast and County Down Railway connected Newtownards to Belfast, via Comber and Dundonald, in 1850, and to Donaghadee in 1861. By the same year, the town&#x27;s population had risen to 9,500. (This rail line was closed in 1950.) On 12 July 1867, despite the Party Processions Acts, the Orange Order paraded from Bangor to Newtownards. The parade was organised by William Johnston (sentenced to a short term in prison the next year for his actions) and about 30,000 took part.

As the nineteenth century progressed the economy became increasingly tied to the growing city of Belfast and the town continued to prosper and by the 20th century had increasingly become a commuter town. Newtownards&#x27; population reached 13,100 in 1961 and had doubled to 28,000 by 2011.

===The Troubles===
During the Troubles, Newtownards was the scene of a car bomb attack on 5 July 1993, when Roma&#x27;s Bar in Regent Street was targeted. The pub was destroyed, but has since been rebuilt. The attack was carried out by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) with a 700 kg (1,500 lb) device. There were no fatalities. Police said the 10-minute warning, telephoned to a local radio station, was &quot;totally inadequate.&quot; The warning said the bomb contained 1,500 pounds of explosives.

===Recent times===
On 1 November 2021, a bus in the town was hijacked and set on fire by two masked assailants allegedly protesting the Northern Ireland Protocol.

==Places of interest==
===Scrabo Tower===

The town of Newtownards is overlooked by the high Scrabo Tower. The tower is 41 metres high, and was erected on Scrabo Hill as a memorial to Charles Stewart, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry in 1857. Those loyal to the Stewart family suggested the inspiration lay in the gratitude of his tenantry for his solicitude during the famine. Given the popular criticism the Marquess in those years, this seems doubtful. In 1847 he and his wife made contributions of £20 and £10 to their local relief committees. The following year they expended £15,000 renovating their home in Mount Stewart. Only 450 subscribers were connected to the estate on which there were 1,200 tenants farmers and many associated employees. Two-thirds of the cost was met by 98 subscribers (on a list headed by Emperor Napoleon III of France), most of whom were fellow gentry.

The Scottish baronial-style tower is open to the public and houses a historical and local environment exhibition. The basalt-topped sandstone hill at Scrabo is one of the dominant features of north Down. The tower now stands in Scrabo Country Park with its woodland walks and parkland through Killynether Wood.

===Movilla Abbey===
The ancient ruins of Movilla Abbey, monastic settlement are situated within the grounds of Movilla Cemetery. Nothing visible remains today of Finnian&#x27;s original Celtic Abbey, but the 15th Century Augustinian ruins still stand, and are worth seeing. They are a part of the St Patrick&#x27;s Trail Tourist Route

===Somme Heritage Centre===
The Somme Heritage Centre, which is situated a little north of the town, is the Somme Association&#x27;s flagship project. Situated adjacent to the Clandeboye Estate outside Newtownards, the centre is a unique visitor attraction of international significance showing the reality of the Great War and its effects on the community at home. The centre commemorates the involvement of the 36th (Ulster) and 16th (Irish) divisions in the Battle of the Somme, the 10th (Irish) Division in Gallipoli, Salonika and Palestine, and provides displays and information on the entire Irish contribution to the First World War.

===Mount Stewart===
On the east shore of Strangford Lough, a few miles outside Newtownards and near Greyabbey, stands Mount Stewart, an 18th-century house and garden – the home of the Londonderry family. The house and its contents reflect the history of the Londonderrys who played a leading role in British social and political life. The ninety-eight acre garden at Mount Stewart has been proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

;Ards motor racing Circuit

The Ards Circuit through Newtownards was a motorsport street circuit used for RAC Tourist Trophy sports car races from 1928 until 1936. At the time it was Northern Ireland&#x27;s premier sporting event, regularly attracting crowds in excess of a quarter of a million people.

On 5 September 1936, in appallingly wet conditions, local driver Jack Chambers lost control of his Riley approaching the Strangford Arms in Newtownards at the Newtownards rail bridge and crashed into the crowd, killing eight spectators. This tragedy brought an end to nine years of racing over the Ards street circuit.

<text>Strabane (; ) is a town in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland.

Strabane had a population of 13,507 at the 2021 census. It lies on the east bank of the River Foyle. It is roughly midway from Omagh, Derry and Letterkenny. The River Foyle marks the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. On the other side of the river (across Lifford Bridge) is the smaller town of Lifford, which is the county town of Donegal. The River Mourne flows through the centre of the town and meets the Finn to form the Foyle River. A large hill named Knockavoe, which marks the beginning of the Sperrin Mountains, forms the backdrop to the town.

==History==
===Early history===
The locale was home to a group of northern Celts known as the Orighella as far back as the fourth century when the territories of Owen (later Tír Eoghain) and Connail (later Tír Chonaill - mostly modern County Donegal) were established, and Orighella were assimilated into the Cenél Conaill. With the arrival of Saint Patrick, a mission established a church in the area near Castlefin, and having visited the Grianán Aileach for the conversion of Owen, returned along the Foyle river, establishing a further church at Leckpatrick (the name means &#x27;the flagstone of St. Patrick&#x27;). A later church was established at Lifford/Clonleigh by a mission headed by St. Colmcille. In AD 586 St. Colgan established a monastery at Camus [from whence the parish of Camus-Juxta-Mourne gets its name]. Other monasteries and religious sites were established at this time at Urney, Ballycolman, Donagheady, and Artigarvan.

===Middle Ages===
Vikings arrived at Lifford in AD 832 and maintained a presence on the Foyle until AD 863 when they were expelled by Áed Findliath. The regional seat of power was to be the Grianán Aileach until 1101, when it was destroyed by the O&#x27;Briens of Thomond, and was then moved to Urney, three miles outside Strabane. In 1243, the seat of power for all Tyrone and the O&#x27;Neill dynasty was moved to Cookstown. It was during this epoch, in AD 1231, that Franciscan friars established a religious foundation on what is now the old graveyard at St. Patrick&#x27;s Street, Strabane.

===Seventeenth century===
The town was settled by Scottish families in the 1600s, an action that preceded the Plantation of Ulster. In 1608, during O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s Rebellion, most of the inhabitants fled to the safety of the fort of Lifford following Sir Cahir O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s Burning of Derry and Burning of Strabane.

===Twentieth century===

In 1921, Strabane became a border town following the partition of Ireland. Sitting directly astride the border, Strabane suffered extensive damage during the Troubles from the early 1970s: Strabane Town Hall was destroyed in a bomb attack in 1972. The damage continued throughout much of the 1990s, with bombings and shootings commonplace; Irish Republican paramilitary groups, mainly the Provisional Irish Republican Army, regularly attacked the town&#x27;s British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) bases. Strabane was once the most bombed town in Europe in proportion to its size, and was the most bombed town in Northern Ireland.

Many civilians and members of the security forces were killed or injured in the area over the course of the Troubles. Many British Army regiments from England, Scotland and Wales served in Strabane at various times during the Troubles in the barracks at the locally named &quot;Camel&#x27;s hump&quot; beside Lifford Bridge. As a result of the Good Friday Agreement, there is no longer any British Army presence in the town. Strabane became involved in the Ulster Project International, sending Catholic and Protestant teenagers to the United States for prejudice-reduction work.

At the height of The Troubles, Strabane garnered the dubious distinction of the highest unemployment rate in the industrial world. It is one of the most economically deprived towns in the United Kingdom. Huge economic damage occurred when much of the town centre flooded in 1987.

In August 2005, a Channel 4 television programme presented by property experts Kirstie Allsopp and Phil Spencer named Strabane the eighth-worst place to live in the UK, largely owing to unemployment. Strabane had been moved out of the top 20 in the 2007 edition.

As a result, the Strabane Community Unemployed Group was founded to find solutions to long-term unemployment and combat the causes of unemployment. Sister Mary Carmel Fanning, a retired Catholic girls school principal who had been awarded the MBE for her services to education in 1997, became a director of the group later that year.

==Transport==

===Railways===
The Irish gauge Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway (L&amp;ER) reached Strabane in 1847, Omagh in 1852 and Enniskillen in 1854. The Great Northern Railway (Ireland) took over the L&amp;ER in 1883.

The Finn Valley Railway (FV) opened from Strabane to Stranorlar in 1863. The FV was originally Irish gauge but in 1892 it merged with the narrow gauge West Donegal Railway (WD) to form the Donegal Railway and was reduced to the same narrow gauge for through running. The Donegal Railway opened its own line to Derry in 1900. In 1906 the GNR and Northern Counties Committee jointly took over the Donegal Railway, making it the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee. The gauge Strabane and Letterkenny Railway opened in 1909 and was worked by the Joint Committee.

The partition of Ireland in 1922 turned the boundary with County Donegal into an international frontier. This changed trade patterns to the railways&#x27; detriment and placed border posts on the Joint Committee&#x27;s FV and S&amp;L lines and on the GNR line to Derry. Stops for customs inspections greatly delayed trains and disrupted timekeeping. Over the next few years customs agreements between the two states enabled GNR trains between Strabane and Derry to pass through the Free State without inspection unless they were scheduled to serve local stations on the west bank of the Foyle, and for goods on all railways to be carried between different parts of the Free State to pass through Northern Ireland under customs bond. The Joint Committee&#x27;s Strabane-Derry line was closed in 1954, followed by the remainder of the narrow gauge system in 1960. In 1958 the Ulster Transport Authority took over the remaining GNR lines on the Northern Ireland side of the border. In accordance with The Benson Report submitted to the Northern Ireland Government in 1963, the UTA closed the former GNR line through Strabane to Derry in 1965.

Little trace remains of Strabane&#x27;s railways except for one old railway building that survives in the town. The nearest railway is operated by Northern Ireland Railways and runs from Derry~Londonderry railway station via Coleraine to Belfast Lanyon Place railway station and Belfast Grand Central station. The Belfast-Derry railway line has been upgraded to facilitate more frequent trains.

==Politics==
As of 2015, Strabane and Derry councils joined to form Derry City and Strabane District Council, and have a strong nationalist majority. At the local elections in May 2011, members of Strabane District Council were elected from the following political parties: 8 Sinn Féin, 4 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), 1 Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), 1 Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and 2 Independent Nationalist. The council chairperson for 2013-14 was Ruairí McHugh of Sinn Féin.

Since 1997 Strabane has been part of the United Kingdom parliamentary constituency of West Tyrone, held since 2001 by Sinn Féin&#x27;s Pat Doherty. From 1983 to 1997 it was part of the Foyle constituency, held during that time by the then-SDLP leader John Hume.

==Culture==
===Sport===
The local Gaelic football team is Strabane Sigersons.

Strabane Cricket Club and Fox Lodge Cricket Club are members of the North West Senior League.

Strabane Athletic F.C. play in the Northern Ireland Intermediate League.

The town has three golf courses prominent among which is the 18-hole Strabane Golf Course.

Angling has historically been popular in the Strabane area. The town and immediate countryside is served by several rivers, with lough fishing at Moorlough and Lough Ash. Strabane is situated at the confluence of the rivers Mourne and Finn where they meet to form the Foyle. Strabane Glen, a steep wooded gorge adjacent to the town, is a designated ASSI (Area of Special Scientific Interest).

===Irish language===
Strabane has an Irish-medium nursery, &quot;Naíscoil an tSratha Báin&quot;, which was founded in 1994, and a Gaelscoil (primary school).

A common greeting in Strabane and the wider North West is &quot;Have ye any bars?&quot; This means &quot;What&#x27;s the news?&quot; or &quot;What&#x27;s the latest gossip?&quot; This may derive from Irish, from the phrase &quot;barr nuachta,&quot; meaning &quot;titbit,&quot; referring to a tasty piece of news.

===Music and arts===

In 2007, the Alley Arts and Conference Centre (designed by architects Glenn Howells and AJA) opened to the general public, offering a 270-seat theatre, art gallery, tourist information centre and cafe-bar. The venue was Northern Ireland Building of the Year in 2008, and won the Allianz Arts and Business Award 2009 and the Green Apple Award 2008. It has also hosted the All Ireland Confined Drama Finals (2008), the North West Music Festival, the Stage Write Schools Drama Festival, Sounds Like Summer Music Festival, Strabane Drama Festival, and the Johnny Crampsie Music Festival.

Strabane plays host to a Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade each year. One of Strabane&#x27;s most notable features are five steel structures on the banks of the river. Designed by Maurice Harron, they consist of two dancers and a fiddle player on the Lifford side, a flute player on the Strabane side and a drummer in the middle.

==Religion==

According to the 2011 census, 91.57% of the residents were from a Catholic background and 7.22% were from a Protestant background. There are a number of places of worship for the residents of Strabane and the surrounding district. The three main Catholic churches are the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Barrack Street, Sacred Heart Church, Derry Road and St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Melmount Road.

The main Church of Ireland church is Christ Church, Bowling Green. The main Presbyterian Church is located on the Derry Road while the main Methodist Church is located on Railway Street.

==Education==
There are a number of infant, primary and secondary schools in the Strabane area. The central location of the town allows parents the choice of schools in Derry, Omagh and Donegal.

There are two secondary schools in the town: Holy Cross College and Strabane Academy. Holy Cross College was created in 2003 with the amalgamation of Strabane&#x27;s three Catholic post-primary schools, the Convent Grammar School, St Colman&#x27;s High School and Our Lady of Mercy High School. The college had been operating across the three sites until its new £29 million building opened in September 2009, catering for 1,400 pupils. Holy Cross is a co-ed bilateral college, which means it offers grammar status education within an all-ability school. It is regarded as a &quot;blueprint for the future of education in Northern Ireland&quot; because it caters for both academic and vocational paths. The other secondary school is Strabane Academy which was formed in 2011 when Strabane Grammar School merged with Strabane High School.

The North West Regional College, which has campuses in Derry, Limavady as well as Strabane, offers a range of vocational and non-vocational courses for post 16 year olds.

<doc id="98258" wikidata="Q165241" url="?curid=98258" title="Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway">
<text>Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway (; Haakon Magnus; born 20 July 1973) is the heir apparent to the Norwegian throne. He is the only son of King Harald V and Queen Sonja.

Haakon represents the fourth generation of the sitting Norwegian royal family of the House of Glücksburg. He married Mette-Marit Tjessem Høiby, with whom he has two children, Princess Ingrid Alexandra and Prince Sverre Magnus.

Haakon has been a member of the Young Global Leaders network, its Foundation, a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations, and a philanthropist. He is a trained naval officer and, as crown prince, a top military official in the Norwegian Armed Forces. He holds a BA in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley, as well as an MSc in Development Studies from the London School of Economics.

== Early life and family ==
Haakon was born on 20 July 1973 at The National Hospital in St Hanshaugen, Oslo, the only son and younger child of Crown Prince Harald and Crown Princess Sonja. His father was the son of the reigning Norwegian monarch, Olav V. At birth he was named Haakon Magnus, and it was stressed in the announcement that he would go by the name Haakon. He was baptised in the Church of Norway on 20 September 1973 in the chapel of the Royal Palace. He was named in honour of his paternal great-grandfather, Haakon VII, his maternal uncle Haakon Haraldsen, and Magnus for the Norwegian saint and martyr. When Haakon was 17, his grandfather Olav died on 17 January 1991, leading to the accession of his father as King Harald V and his own advancement to crown prince.

Haakon has one sibling, Princess Märtha Louise of Norway (born 1971). In 1990, the Norwegian constitution was altered, granting absolute primogeniture to the Norwegian throne, meaning that the eldest child, regardless of gender, takes precedence in the line of succession. This was not, however, done retroactively (as, for example, Sweden had done in 1980), meaning that Haakon continues to take precedence over his older sister.

=== Education and military ===
Haakon served in the Royal Norwegian Navy. He graduated from the Norwegian Naval Academy in 1995, followed with a year aboard missile torpedo boats and navy vessels.

He attended and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1999. Haakon later attended lectures at the University of Oslo and took the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs&#x27; civil servant introductory course in 2001. He completed his education in 2003 at the London School of Economics, where he was awarded an MSc in development studies, specializing in international trade and Africa.

As of 15 November 2013, in the Royal Norwegian Navy his officer rank is Admiral, and in the Norwegian Army and the Royal Norwegian Air Force his rank is General.

In 2016 he completed the Norwegian Army&#x27;s paratrooper course and was certified as a military paratrooper. The course attended was administered by the Special Operations Commando.

== Marriage and children ==
Haakon married a commoner and single mother, Mette-Marit Tjessem Høiby, on 25 August 2001, at Oslo Cathedral. Frederik (then Crown Prince, and now King) of Denmark was the best man. When the engagement between Crown Prince Haakon and Høiby was announced, many Norwegians felt that his choice of wife was inappropriate. This was primarily about her being a single mother, but information concerning her involvement in the rave scene in Oslo, which included a significant drug-subculture, also added to the controversy. In addition, the father of her child was convicted of drug-related offences. In a heartfelt press conference before the wedding the bride explained her past, saying among other things that her youthful rebelliousness might have been stronger than most young people. The issue of Mette-Marit&#x27;s past was an ongoing discussion in Norwegian public discourse in the early years after their engagement and marriage.

The couple have two children together: Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway (born 21 January 2004 at Oslo University National Hospital in Oslo) and Prince Sverre Magnus (born 3 December 2005 in Oslo University National Hospital in Oslo). Haakon is also the stepfather to Mette-Marit&#x27;s son, Marius Borg Høiby. The Skaugum Estate, situated in the area of Semsvannet, is their official residence.

== Activities ==
From 25 November 2003 to 12 April 2004, Haakon was regent during the King&#x27;s treatment for cancer and the subsequent convalescence period. Likewise, Haakon was regent from 29 March 2005 until the King had fully recovered from the heart surgery he underwent on 1 April. This period ended on 7 June. Haakon served as regent a third time during 2024 during the King&#x27;s hospitalization due to an infection and pacemaker implantation surgery.

In addition to his official duties, Haakon has a strong interest in cultural matters. He also has given patronage to a number of organisations. In 2006, Haakon was one of three founders of Global Dignity, alongside Pekka Himanen and John Hope Bryant.

In 2003, the Crown Prince was appointed as Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). In 2013, Crown Prince Haakon established the SIKT conference. The Crown Prince attends the annual conference of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise (NHO), and met the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO) for an introduction in the Tripartite cooperation in 2016.

Crown Prince Haakon was a member of the Young Global Leaders network from 2005 until 2010. From 2010 until 2017, the Crown Prince served as a member of the Young Global Leaders Foundation Board.

Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit established The Crown Prince and Crown Princess&#x27;s Foundation. He is a patron of 4H Norge, ANSA, The Ibsen Stage Festival, Nordland Music Festival, and several other organizations. In 2017, he became a patron of the Norwegian Refugee Council.

In May 2022 Haakon joined an expedition from the University of Tromsø aimed at disseminating knowledge about polar history and the critical scientific research taking place in the Arctic for two weeks and crossed the Greenland ice sheet using a snowkite.

In response to the 2022 Oslo shooting, Haakon told reporters, &quot;We must protect the right in Norway to love whomever we want.&quot;

=== Personal interests ===
Haakon was involved in several sports and seemed to take a particular liking to windsurfing and surfing, although he has not engaged in serious competitions. Haakon is known as a big music fan. When he was younger, he attended music festivals all over Europe, including the Roskilde Festival in Denmark and the Quart Festival in Kristiansand, Norway.

He has also been part of Olympics ceremonies. In 1994, the Crown Prince and his father played roles during the opening ceremony in Lillehammer: while the King declared the Games opened, the Crown Prince lit the cauldron, paying tribute to his father and grandfather having served as Olympians. In 2016, his daughter Princess Ingrid Alexandra did the same at the II Winter Youth Olympics, which was also held in Lillehammer. In 2010, Haakon attended the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

He accompanied the band Katzenjammer in their recording of the song &quot;Vi tenner våre lykter&quot; (i.e., &#x27;We light our lanterns&#x27; for the 2011 Christmas-themed album of the same name). Proceeds benefited &quot;Their Royal Highnesses The Crown Prince and Crown Princess funds.&quot;

<doc id="98262" wikidata="Q131045" url="?curid=98262" title="Queen Sonja of Norway">
<text>Sonja (born Sonja Haraldsen; 4 July 1937) is Queen of Norway as the wife of King Harald V.

Sonja and the then Crown Prince Harald had dated for nine years prior to their marriage in 1968. They had kept their relationship a secret due to the controversy of Sonja&#x27;s status as a commoner. Harald had told his father, King Olav V, that he would remain unmarried if his father did not grant consent to marry Sonja. Upon their marriage, Sonja became crown princess and later the queen of Norway upon her husband&#x27;s accession to the throne in 1991, becoming Norway&#x27;s first queen consort in 52 years. The couple has two children together: Princess Märtha Louise and Crown Prince Haakon.

As queen, Sonja holds patronage of up to fifteen organisations. Sonja has also served as Vice President of the Norwegian Red Cross from 1987 to 1990. In 2005, she became the first queen to visit Antarctica. In 2017, she was awarded the Trysil-Knut Prize, making her the first woman to receive the award. She is also known for her interest in music, art and culture, having founded the Queen Sonja International Music Competition and the Queen Sonja Print Award. She is also a graphic artist and ceramicist, with many of her works being featured in exhibitions across Norway and other countries.

==Early life==
Sonja Haraldsen was born on 4 July 1937 in Oslo, the daughter of clothing merchant Karl August Haraldsen and Dagny Ulrichsen. She had three siblings, Haakon Haraldsen, Gry Henriksen and Karl Herman Haraldsen, who died in a boating accident. She grew up at Tuengen Allé 1B in the district of Vinderen in Oslo and completed her lower secondary schooling in 1954. She received a diploma in dressmaking and tailoring at the Oslo Vocational School, and a diploma from École Professionnelle des Jeunes Filles (a finishing school) in Lausanne, Switzerland. There, she studied accounting, fashion design, and social science. She returned to Norway for further studies and received an undergraduate degree (French, English and Art History) from the University of Oslo.

==Marriage==

In June 1959 she first met Crown Prince Harald (the future King Harald V) at a party hosted by Johan H. Stenersen. Later in August the Crown Prince invited her to his graduation ball, where they were photographed together for the first time. They dated for nine years, although their relationship had been kept secret because she was a commoner. The Crown Prince made it clear to his father, King Olav V, that he would remain unmarried for life unless he could marry her. This would in effect have put an end to the rule of his family, and likely to the monarchy in Norway, as Harald was the sole heir to the throne. Faced with having to choose one of his relatives from the Danish royal family, the Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein or even the Grand Dukes of Oldenburg as his new heir in place of his son, Olav V consulted the government for advice; as a result, Sonja became engaged to Crown Prince Harald on 19 March 1968. The couple married on 29 August 1968, at Oslo Cathedral. She thus acquired the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; and the title of Crown Princess of Norway.

==Public life==

Following the death of King Olav V on 17 January 1991, Sonja became Norway&#x27;s first queen consort in 52 years. Queen Sonja accompanied King Harald V when he swore his oath to uphold the Constitution in the Storting on 21 January 1991. During Haakon VII of Norway&#x27;s reign, his wife Queen Maud died in 1938 and his son Olav V was then crown prince when his wife Princess Märtha of Sweden died in 1954 before he became king three years later. It was also the first time in 69 years that a Norwegian queen had been present in the Storting. Since his accession, Queen Sonja has accompanied the King to the formal opening of the autumn session of the Storting and the reading of the Speech from the Throne.

In accordance with their own wishes, the King and Queen were consecrated in Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim on 23 June 1991. Following the consecration, the King and Queen conducted a 10-day tour of Southern Norway. In 1992, the entire royal family conducted a 22-day tour of Norway&#x27;s four northernmost counties.

The Queen accompanies the King on official state visits abroad. She acts as the hostess when foreign heads of state officially visit Norway.

In 2005, Queen Sonja became the first queen ever to visit Antarctica. The Queen was there to open the Norwegian Troll research station in the country&#x27;s Antarctic dependency, Queen Maud Land. The Queen flew in on one of the Royal Norwegian Air Force&#x27;s C-130H Hercules transport aircraft, landing at Troll Airfield.

In 2017 Queen Sonja was awarded the Trysil-Knut Prize. She is the first woman to ever receive the award.

The Queen was appointed a Rear Admiral in the Royal Norwegian Navy and a Brigadier in the Norwegian Army. She has undergone a basic officer training course and has participated in exercises.

On 17 January 2021, Queen Sonja celebrated 30 years as Norway&#x27;s queen consort.

===Activities===
In 1972 she was involved in establishing Princess Märtha Louise&#x27;s Fund, which provides assistance to disabled children in Norway. She has taken active part in large-scale initiatives to raise funds for international refugees and spent time in the 1970s visiting Vietnamese boat refugees in Malaysia.

From 1987 to 1990, Crown Princess Sonja served as Vice President of the Norwegian Red Cross. She was responsible for the organisation&#x27;s international activities. She took part in a Red Cross delegation to Botswana and Zimbabwe in 1989.

Queen Sonja&#x27;s School Award was established in 2006 and is awarded to schools who have &quot;demonstrated excellence in its efforts to promote inclusion and equality&quot;.

In 2021, Frank Rossavik said that now she is starting an [art] gallery, to sell works by artists that she has given her prestigious prizes to.

===Personal interests===
Sonja established the Queen Sonja International Music Competition in 1988. It was originally for pianists, but in 1995 the competition became only for singers. The jury consists of diverse authoritative figures in opera and the winners receive a cash amount and prestigious engagements at Norwegian music institutions.

She is a longtime avid photographer and has a keen interest in art. She is a printmaker, and held exhibitions with artists Kjell Nupen and Ørnulf Opdahl in 2011 and 2013. The Queen Sonja Nordic Art Award was established in 2011 with Tiina Kivinen from Finland being the first recipient in 2012. The prize will be awarded every other year.

In 2017, The Queen Sonja Art Stable was opened, a venue which will function as a scene for arts and culture. Together with King Harald, the queen has for decades attempted to establish a palace museum in Oslo.

The Queen is a keen hiker, and this was marked by a sculpture unveiled for her 80th birthday as a gift from the Norwegian Trekking Association.

===Health===
In January 2025, Sonja was admitted to Lillehammer Hospital for observation following atrial fibrillation during on a skiing trip. She underwent surgery at the Oslo University Hospital on 16 January to receive a pacemaker implant.

=== In popular culture ===
In the 2025 on Amazon Prime Video published period drama &quot;The Commoner&quot;, which tells the story of the fight of then Crown Prince Harald and Sonja Haraldsen for their right to marry, Queen Sonja of Norway is portrayed by Gina Bernhoft Gørvell.

==Honours==
In 1982 she was awarded the Nansen Refugee Award. In 2007, she received the Holmenkollen medal with Simon Ammann, Frode Estil, Odd-Bjørn Hjelmeset, and her husband, King Harald V.

<text>Hatmehit or Hatmehyt () was an Ancient Egyptian goddess associated with the city in the Nile Delta known as Djedet () or Mendes ().

== Etymology ==
Hatmehit&#x27;s name is typically translated as &quot;Foremost of Fish&quot;, literally from the words &quot;ḥꜢt&quot; &quot;Chief, head, foremost&quot; and &quot;mḥyt&quot; &quot;fish&quot; (as a mass noun). However, the word &quot;mḥyt&quot; in Hatmehit&#x27;s name does not include the fish determinative, which allows it to have a double meaning. The root of &quot;mḥyt&quot; is &quot;mḥj&quot;, which also means &quot;to flood&quot;. Therefore her name is sometimes considered to mean &quot;Foremost of the Inundation&quot;, with a connection drawn between the floodwaters and the fish that come with them.

== Iconography ==
In Ancient Egyptian art, Hatmehit was traditionally depicted either as a fish or a woman with a fish emblem or crown on her head. The fish can be directly above her head or presented on a standard, as in the nome symbol of Nome 16 of Lower Egypt. Due to that, it is difficult to distinguish images that depict Hatmehit from that of a female personification of the Mendesian nome.

The identification of the fish that is her symbol has been debated, with various researchers identifying it as a dolphin, a lepidotes, or a schilbe. However, the iconography of the creature was consistent, with a relatively small head, prominent dorsal spine, and a long anal fin which extends most of the way down its tail. More recent interpretations of the Mendes fish by the current excavation headed by Donald and Susan Redford describe it as &quot;Schilbe mystus&quot;.

In later periods Hatmehit takes on the iconography of Isis and Hathor, with her fish standard or crown replaced by the horns and sun disk that both shared.

== Cult ==
Hatmehit was part of the Mendesian triad which consisted of her, the god Banebdjedet, and Harpocrates (Horus the child).

Her cult was localized mainly to Nome 16 of Lower Egypt around Mendes although there are depictions of her found widely around Egypt. She can be found in the temples at Behbeit El Hagar, Dendera, and Edfu, as well as in tombs in Abusir and Bahariya Oasis. The first evidence of her dates back to the Old Kingdom as part of the titulary of the official Hetepi, who was called &quot;Inspector of the Estate &#x27;Seat of the Goddess Hatmehit&#x27; of the Great phyle&quot; as well as on the walls of the mortuary complex of Sahure.

Due to the identical iconography, Hatmehit may have originated as the tutelary goddess of the city of Mendes and its accompanying nome. Her spheres of influence corresponded with the concerns and lifestyle of those who resided within Mendes. For example, due to Mendes&#x27; role as a center for perfume production, Hatmehit gained an association with good scents and perfumery. Some of her epithets included &quot;Lady of Punt&quot;, &quot;Lady of myrrh&quot;, and &quot;She who creates everyone&#x27;s scent&quot;.

The only location of a shrine to Hatmehit discovered thus far in Mendes was one located near an ancient harbor. Several examples of stelae inscribed with fish as well as fish-shaped jars with the remains of juvenile schilbe were found. These represent votive offerings to the goddess, supported by the beer jug and bread molds that were also found in the area.

Outside of Mendes, Hatmehit appears as a deity overseeing the day on IV Akhet 22 in Dendera and II Peret 3 in Edfu. On IV Akhet 28, there is a Procession of Hatmehit recorded in the Cairo Calendar. This is accompanied by instructions to neither eat nor offer fish on that day, due to Hatmehit leaving Mendes in the form of an &quot;i͗tn&quot; fish.

== Connections with other gods ==
===Isis===

In earlier periods, Hatmehit was considered her own goddess. However from the Third Intermediate Period onwards, Isis would begin to take the role of Hatmehit in the local cult, with Hatmehit being considered a form of Isis particular to Mendes. This was prompted by the growing association between Banebdjedet and Osiris, with Banebdjedet being considered the &quot;ba&quot; of Osiris. This is also evidenced by her epithets &quot;She who looks for (the members of) her brother on the flow&quot; and &quot;The excellent Sister of He who wakes healthy (=Osiris)&quot;.

The Dendera temple complex contains the most evidence of the connection between Isis and Hatmehit, where Isis is referred to explicitly as Hatmehit on two occasions. The first is on the wall of the mysterious hall in a series of inscriptions about Isis visiting the various nomes. When they get to Nome 16 of Lower Egypt it states:
: &quot;The king of Upper and Lower Egypt, the son of Ra comes to you, Isis the great, the mother of the god, mistress of Iatdi. He brings you to the capital of the Mendesian nome carrying his possessions, it garnishes your chapel, you are Hatmehit, sovereign in Mendes, who seeks (the members of) her brother on the flow.&quot; 
The second was a shorter reference found on the doorjamb to a room called the Birthplace of Isis where as part of her titulary she was called by the name &quot;Hatmehit, who protects ames-scepter&quot;.

As the connection between Isis and Hatmehit became stronger, eventually Isis was shown as part of the Mendesian triad without necessarily being explicitly identified as Hatmehit. For example, a stela from Mendes from the reign of Iuput II depicts an offering being given to a triad of Banebdjedet, Isis the Great, and Harpocrates. Another stela depicts Ptolemy II Philadelphus making an offering to the deified Arsinoe II, the ram of Mendes, Banebdjedet the &quot;ba&quot; of Osiris, and a figure with the inscription &quot;Ꜣst-wrt-ḥꜢt-mḥyt&quot; &quot;Isis the Great Hatmehit&quot;.

Isis-Hatmehit remained an important part of life in the Mendesian nome into the Roman period. She featured on several coins from the reign of Trajan and Hadrian, typically wearing the sun disk and horns and holding a small goat or ram representing Banebdjedet. 

=== Hathor ===
Hatmehit is considered by some Egyptologists to be connected with Hathor. Hathor is one of the oldest deities of Egypt who also went by the name Mehet-Weret, meaning &quot;great flood&quot;. This may possibly be due to being seen as a remnant of the primal waters of creation from which all things arose. Other goddesses associated with the primal waters of creation are Mut and Naunet.

=== Nephthys ===
There is one note of a Nephthys-Hatmehit in a hieratic papyrus Book of Hours. Additionally, Herman de Meulenaere argues that due to Hatmehit&#x27;s epithets describing her as one of the parties who search for the body of Osiris that pointed to a connection with Nephthys as well.

<doc id="98275" wikidata="Q618477" url="?curid=98275" title="Aphotic zone">
<text>The aphotic zone (aphotic from Greek prefix + &quot;without light&quot;) is the portion of a lake or ocean where there is little or no sunlight. It is formally defined as the depths beyond which less than 1 percent of sunlight penetrates. Above the aphotic zone is the photic zone, which consists of the euphotic zone and the disphotic zone. The euphotic zone is the layer of water in which there is enough light for net photosynthesis to occur. The disphotic zone, also known as the twilight zone, is the layer of water with enough light for predators to see but not enough for the rate of photosynthesis to be greater than the rate of respiration.

The depth at which less than one percent of sunlight reaches begins the aphotic zone. While most of the ocean&#x27;s biomass lives in the photic zone, the majority of the ocean&#x27;s water lies in the aphotic zone. Bioluminescence is more abundant than sunlight in this zone. Most food in this zone comes from dead organisms sinking to the bottom of the lake or ocean from overlying waters.

The depth of the aphotic zone can be greatly affected by such things as turbidity and the season of the year. The aphotic zone underlies the photic zone, which is that portion of a lake or ocean directly affected by sunlight.

==The Dark Ocean==

In the ocean, the aphotic zone is sometimes referred to as the dark ocean. Depending on how it is defined, the aphotic zone of the ocean begins between depths of about to and extends to the ocean floor. The majority of the ocean is aphotic, with the average depth of the sea being deep; the deepest part of the sea, the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, is about deep. The depth at which the aphotic zone begins in the ocean depends on many factors. In clear, tropical water sunlight can penetrate deeper and so the aphotic zone starts at greater depths. Around the poles, the angle of the sunlight means it does not penetrate as deeply so the aphotic zone is shallower. If the water is turbid, suspended material can block light from penetrating, resulting in a shallower aphotic zone. Temperatures can range from roughly to .

The aphotic zone is further divided into the mesopelagic, bathyal, abyssal, and hadal zones. The mesopelagic zone extends from to . The bathyal zone extends from to . The abyssal zone extends from to or , depending on the authority. The hadal zone refers to the greatest depths, deeper than the abyssal zone. Some twilight occurs in the mesopelagic zone, but creatures below the mesopelagic must be able to live in complete darkness.

==Life in the aphotic zone==
Though photosynthesis cannot occur in the aphotic zone, it is not unusual to find an abundance of phytoplankton there. Convective mixing due to cooling surface water sinking can increase the concentration of phytoplankton in the aphotic zone and lead to under-estimations of primary production in the euphotic zone during convective mixing events.

Unusual and unique creatures dwell in this expanse of pitch black water, such as the gulper eel, giant squid, anglerfish, and vampire squid. Some life in the aphotic zone does not rely on sunlight at all. Benthic communities around methane seeps rely on methane-oxidizing microorganisms to supply energy to other microorganisms.

In some rare cases, bacteria use chemical energy sources such as sulfides and methane. Many of the animals in the aphotic zone are bioluminescent, meaning they can produce their light. Bioluminescence can be used both for navigation and luring small animals into their jaws. An excellent example of this is the angler fish, as it has a light lure protruding in front of its mouth from a unique appendage on its head which provides navigation and as bait for smaller animals.

Some animals can cross between the photic and aphotic zones in search of food. For example, the sperm whale and the southern elephant seal occasionally hunt in the aphotic zone despite the water pressure squashing their bodies; however, not fatally.

== Aphotic zone migration ==
After sunset, millions of organisms swarm up from the depths to feed on the microorganisms floating in the warm epipelagic zone. Many copepods and invertebrate larvae come up to shallower waters to eat the phytoplankton, which attracts many predators like squid, hatchetfish, and lantern fish. The migration of the many bioluminescent animals is visible to the naked eye. This nightly vertical migration is the largest (in terms of the number of animals) on our planet.

<doc id="98279" wikidata="Q430544" url="?curid=98279" title="Silver Age of Comic Books">
<text>The Silver Age of Comic Books was a period of artistic advancement and widespread commercial success in mainstream American comic books, predominantly those featuring the superhero archetype. Following the Golden Age of Comic Books, the Silver Age is considered to cover the period from 1956 to 1970, and was succeeded by the Bronze Age of Comic Books.

The popularity and circulation of comic books about superheroes had declined following World War II, and comic books about horror, crime and romance took larger shares of the market. However, controversy arose over alleged links between comic books and juvenile delinquency, focusing in particular on crime, horror, and superheroes. In 1954, publishers implemented the Comics Code Authority to regulate comic content.

In the wake of these changes, publishers began introducing superhero stories again, a change that began with the introduction of a new version of DC Comics&#x27; The Flash in &quot;Showcase&quot; #4 (October 1956). In response to strong demand, DC began publishing more superhero titles including &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, which prompted Marvel Comics to follow suit beginning with &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #1.

A number of important comics writers and artists contributed to the early part of the era, including writers Stan Lee, Gardner Fox, John Broome, and Robert Kanigher, and artists Curt Swan, Jack Kirby, Gil Kane, Steve Ditko, Mike Sekowsky, Gene Colan, Carmine Infantino, John Buscema, and John Romita Sr. By the end of the Silver Age, a new generation of talent had entered the field, including writers Denny O&#x27;Neil, Gary Friedrich, Roy Thomas, and Archie Goodwin, and artists such as Neal Adams, Herb Trimpe, Jim Steranko, and Barry Windsor-Smith.

Silver Age comics have become collectible, with a copy in the best condition known of &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 (August 1962), the debut of Spider-Man, selling for $1.1 million in 2011. In 2022, a copy of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #1 sold for $1.5 million.

==Origin of the term==
Comics historian and movie producer Michael Uslan traces the origin of the &quot;Silver Age&quot; term to the letters column of &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #42 (February 1966), which went on sale December 9, 1965. Letter-writer Scott Taylor of Westport, Connecticut, wrote: &quot;If you guys keep bringing back the heroes from the [1930s–1940s] Golden Age, people 20 years from now will be calling this decade the Silver Sixties!&quot; According to Uslan, the natural hierarchy of gold-silver-bronze, as in Olympic medals, took hold: &quot;Fans immediately glommed onto this, refining it more directly into a &quot;Silver&quot; Age version of the Golden Age. Very soon, it was in our vernacular, replacing such expressions as ... &#x27;Second Heroic Age of Comics&#x27; or &#x27;The Modern Age&#x27; of comics. It wasn&#x27;t long before dealers were ... specifying it was a Golden Age comic for sale or a Silver Age comic for sale.&quot;

==History==
===Background===

Spanning World War II, when American comics provided cheap and disposable escapist entertainment that could be read and then discarded by the troops, the Golden Age of comic books covered the late 1930s to the late 1940s. A number of major superheroes were created during this period, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, and Captain America. In subsequent years comics were blamed for a rise in juvenile crime statistics, although this rise was shown to be in direct proportion to population growth. When juvenile offenders admitted to reading comics, it was seized on as a common denominator; one notable critic was Fredric Wertham, author of the book &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; (1954), who attempted to shift the blame for juvenile delinquency from the parents of the children to the comic books they read. The result was a decline in the comics industry. To address public concerns, in 1954 the Comics Code Authority was created to regulate and curb sex, drugs and violence in comics, marking the start of a new era.

===DC Comics===
The Silver Age began with the publication of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Showcase&quot; #4 (October 1956), which introduced the modern version of the Flash. At the time, only three superheroes—Superman (and his younger incarnation as Superboy), Batman (with his sidekick Robin), and Wonder Woman—were still published under their own titles. According to DC comics writer Will Jacobs, Superman was available in &quot;great quantity, but little quality&quot;. Batman and Robin were doing better, but Batman&#x27;s comics were &quot;lackluster&quot; in comparison to his earlier &quot;atmospheric adventures&quot; of the 1940s, and Wonder Woman, having lost her original writer and artist, was no longer &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; or &quot;interesting&quot;. Aquaman and Green Arrow (with his sidekick, Speedy) were also still appearing as back-up features in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;, &quot;the only other two superheroes&quot; known to have remained continuously in print from the Golden Age as the Silver Age began, largely due to their creator&#x27;s ongoing affection for them. Jacobs describes the arrival of &quot;Showcase&quot; #4 on the newsstands as &quot;begging to be bought&quot;, the cover featured an undulating film strip depicting the Flash running so fast that he had escaped from the frame. Editor Julius Schwartz, writer Gardner Fox, and artist Carmine Infantino were some of the people behind the Flash&#x27;s revitalization. Robert Kanigher wrote the first stories of the revived Flash, and John Broome was the writer of many of the earliest stories.
With the success of &quot;Showcase&quot; #4, several other 1940s superheroes were reworked during Schwartz&#x27; tenure, including Green Lantern, Aquaman, the Atom, and Hawkman, and the Justice Society of America was reimagined as the Justice League of America. The DC artists responsible included Murphy Anderson, Gil Kane, Ramona Fradon, Mike Sekowsky, and Joe Kubert. Only the characters&#x27; names remained the same; their costumes, locales, and identities were altered, and imaginative scientific explanations for their superpowers generally took the place of magic as a modus operandi in their stories. Schwartz, a lifelong science-fiction fan, was the inspiration for the re-imagined Green Lantern—the Golden Age character, railroad engineer Alan Scott, possessed a ring powered by a magical lantern, but his Silver Age replacement, test pilot Hal Jordan, had a ring powered by an alien battery and created by an intergalactic police force.

In the mid-1960s, DC established that characters appearing in comics published prior to the Silver Age lived on a parallel Earth the company dubbed Earth-Two. Characters introduced in the Silver Age and onward lived on Earth-One. The two realities were separated by a vibrational field that could be crossed, should a storyline involve superheroes from different worlds teaming up.

Although the Flash is generally regarded as the first superhero of the Silver Age, the introduction of the Martian Manhunter in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #225 predates &quot;Showcase&quot; #4 by almost a year, and at least one historian considers this character the first Silver Age superhero. However, comics historian Craig Shutt, author of the &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; column &quot;Ask Mister Silver Age&quot;, disagrees, noting that the Martian Manhunter debuted as a detective who used his alien abilities to solve crimes, in the &quot;quirky detective&quot; vein of contemporaneous DC characters who were &quot;TV detectives, Indian detectives, supernatural detectives, [and] animal detectives&quot;. Shutt feels the Martian Manhunter only became a superhero in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #273 (November 1959) when he received a secret identity and other superhero accoutrements, saying, &quot;Had Flash not come along, I doubt that the Martian Manhunter would&#x27;ve led the charge from his backup position in &quot;Detective&quot; to a new super-hero age.&quot; Unsuccessful attempts to revive the superhero archetype&#x27;s popularity include Captain Comet, who debuted in &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #9 (June 1951); St. John Publishing Company&#x27;s 1953 revival of Rocket Man under the title Zip-Jet; Fighting American, created in 1954 by the Captain America team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby; Sterling Comics&#x27; Captain Flash and its backup feature Tomboy that same year; Ajax/Farrell Publishing&#x27;s 1954–55 revival of the Phantom Lady; Strong Man, published by Magazine Enterprises in 1955; Charlton Comics&#x27; Nature Boy, introduced in March 1956, and its revival of the Blue Beetle the previous year; and Atlas Comics&#x27; short-lived revivals of Captain America, the Human Torch, and the Sub-Mariner, beginning in &quot;Young Men Comics&quot; #24 (December 1953). In the United Kingdom, the Marvelman series was published from 1954 to 1963, substituting for the British reprints of the Captain Marvel stories after Fawcett stopped publishing the character&#x27;s adventures.

The talking animal superheroes Supermouse and Mighty Mouse were published continuously in their own titles from the end of the Golden Age through the beginning of the Silver Age. Atomic Mouse was given his own title in 1953, lasting ten years. Atomic Rabbit, later named Atomic Bunny, was published from 1955 to 1959.

===Marvel Comics===

DC Comics sparked the superhero revival with its publications from 1955 to 1960. Marvel Comics then capitalized on the revived interest in superhero storytelling with sophisticated stories and characterization. In contrast to previous eras, Marvel characters were &quot;flawed and self-doubting&quot;.

DC added to its momentum with its 1960 introduction of Justice League of America, a team consisting of the company&#x27;s most popular superhero characters. Martin Goodman, a publishing trend-follower with his 1950s Atlas Comics line, by this time called Marvel Comics, &quot;mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most. It was a book called &quot;The&quot; [sic] &quot;Justice League of America&quot; and it was composed of a team of superheroes&quot;, Marvel editor Stan Lee recalled in 1974. Goodman directed Lee to likewise produce a superhero team book, resulting in &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #1 (November 1961).

Under the guidance of writer-editor Stan Lee and artists/co-plotters such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, Marvel began its own rise to prominence. With an innovation that changed the comic-book industry, &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #1 initiated a naturalistic style of superheroes with human failings, fears, and inner demons, who squabbled and worried about the likes of rent-money. In contrast to the straitlaced archetypes of superheroes at the time, this ushered in a revolution. With dynamic artwork by Kirby, Steve Ditko, Don Heck, and others complementing Lee&#x27;s colorful, catchy prose, the new style became popular among college students who could identify with the angst and the irreverent nature of the characters such as Spider-Man, the X-Men and the Hulk during a time period of social upheaval and the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s.

Comic books of the Silver Age explained superhero phenomena and origins through science, inspired by contemporary science fiction, as opposed to the Golden Age, which commonly relied on magic or mysticism.

Comics historian Peter Sanderson compares the 1960s DC to a large Hollywood studio, and argues that after having reinvented the superhero archetype, DC by the latter part of the decade was suffering from a creative drought. The audience for comics was no longer just children, and Sanderson sees the 1960s Marvel as the comic equivalent of the French New Wave, developing new methods of storytelling that drew in and retained readers who were in their teens and older and thus influencing the comics writers and artists of the future.

===Other publishers===
One of the few most-selling American comics publishers in 1956, Harvey Comics, discontinued its horror comics when the Comics Code was implemented and sought a new target audience. Harvey&#x27;s focus shifted to children from 6 to 12 years of age, especially girls, with characters such as Richie Rich, Casper the Friendly Ghost, and Little Dot. Many of the company&#x27;s comics featured young girls who &quot;defied stereotypes and sent a message of acceptance of those who are different&quot;. Although its characters have inspired a number of nostalgic films and ranges of merchandise, Harvey comics of the period are not nearly as sought after in the collectors&#x27; market in contrast to DC and Marvel titles.

The publishers Gilberton, Dell Comics, and Gold Key Comics used their reputations as publishers of wholesome comic books to avoid becoming signatories to the Comics Code and found various ways to continue publishing horror-themed comics in addition to other types. Gilberton&#x27;s extensive &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; line adapted literary classics, with the likes of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; alongside &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;; Classics Illustrated Junior reprinted comic book versions of children&#x27;s classics such as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Rapunzel&quot;, and &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. During the late 1950s and the 1960s, Dell, which had published comics in 1936, offered licensed TV series comic books from &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; to &quot;Top Cat&quot;, as well as numerous Walt Disney titles. Its successor, Gold Key—founded in 1962 after Western Publishing started its own label rather than packaging content for business partner Dell—continued with such licensed TV series and movie adaptations, as well as comics starring such Warner Bros. Cartoons characters as Bugs Bunny and such comic strip properties as &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot;.

With the popularity of the &quot;Batman&quot; television show in 1966, publishers that had specialized in other forms began adding campy superhero titles to their lines. As well, new publishers sprang up, often using creative talent from the Golden Age. Harvey Comics&#x27; Harvey Thriller imprint released &quot;Double-Dare Adventures&quot;, starring new characters such as Bee-Man and Magicmaster. Dell published superhero versions of Frankenstein, Dracula and the Werewolf. Gold Key did licensed versions of live-action and animated superhero television shows such as &quot;Captain Nice&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein Jr.&quot; and &quot;The Impossibles&quot;, and continued the adventures of Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; Goofy character in &quot;Supergoof&quot;. American Comics Group gave its established character Herbie a secret superhero identity as the Fat Fury, and introduced the characters of Nemesis and Magic-Man. Even the iconic Archie Comics teens acquired super powers and superhero identities in comedic titles such as &quot;Archie as Capt. Pureheart&quot; and &quot;Jughead as Captain Hero&quot;. Archie Comics also launched its Archie Adventure line (subsequently titled Mighty Comics), which included the Fly, the Jaguar, and a revamp of the Golden Age hero the Shield. In addition to their individual titles, they teamed in their group series &quot;The Mighty Crusaders&quot;, joined by the Comet and Flygirl. Their stories blended typical superhero fare with the 1960s camp.

Among straightforward Silver Age superheroes from publishers other than Marvel or DC, Charlton Comics offered a short-lived superhero line with characters that included Captain Atom, Judomaster, the Question, and Thunderbolt; Tower Comics had Dynamo, Mercury Man, NoMan and other members of the superhero espionage group T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents; and even Gold Key had Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom.
===Underground comics===

According to John Strausbaugh of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;traditional&quot; comic book historians feel that although the Silver Age deserves study, the only noteworthy aspect of the Silver Age was the advent of underground comics. One commentator has suggested that, &quot;Perhaps one of the reasons underground comics have come to be considered legitimate art is due to the fact that the work of these artists more truly embodies what much of the public believes is true of newspaper strips—that they are written and drawn (i.e., authentically signed by) a single person.&quot; While a large number of mainstream-comics professionals both wrote and drew their own material during the Silver Age, as many had since the start of American comic books, their work is distinct from what another historian describes as the &quot;raw id on paper&quot; of Robert Crumb and Gilbert Shelton. Most often published in black-and-white with glossy color cover and distributed through counterculture bookstores and head shops, underground comics targeted adults and reflected the counterculture movement of the time.

===End and aftermath===

The Silver Age of comic books was followed by the Bronze Age. The demarcation is not clearly defined, but there are a number of possibilities.

Historian Will Jacobs suggests the Silver Age ended in April 1970 when the man who had started it, Julius Schwartz, handed over &quot;Green Lantern&quot;—starring one of the first revived heroes of the era—to the new-guard team of Denny O&#x27;Neil and Neal Adams in response to reduced sales. John Strausbaugh also connects the end of the Silver Age to Green Lantern. He observes that in 1960, the character embodied the can-do optimism of the era. However, by 1972 Green Lantern had become world-weary, with the character saying in one story, &quot;Those days are gone—gone forever—the days I was confident, certain ... I was so young ... so sure I couldn&#x27;t make a mistake! Young and cocky, that was Green Lantern. Well, I&#x27;ve changed. I&#x27;m older now ... maybe wiser, too ... and a lot less happy.&quot; Strausbaugh writes that the Silver Age &quot;went out with that whimper&quot;.

Comics scholar Arnold T. Blumberg places the end of the Silver Age in June 1973, when Gwen Stacy, girlfriend of Peter Parker (Spider-Man), was killed in a story arc later dubbed &quot;The Night Gwen Stacy Died&quot;, saying the era of &quot;innocence&quot; was ended by &quot;the &#x27;snap&#x27; heard round the comic book world—the startling, sickening snap of bone that heralded the death of Gwen Stacy.&quot; Silver Age historian Craig Shutt disputes this, saying, &quot;Gwen Stacy&#x27;s death shocked Spider-Man readers. Such a tragedy makes a strong symbolic ending. This theory gained adherents when Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross&#x27;s &quot;Marvels&quot; miniseries in 1994 ended with Gwen&#x27;s death, but I&#x27;m not buying it. It&#x27;s too late. Too many new directions—especially [the sword-and-sorcery trend begun by the character] Conan and monsters [in the wake of the Comics Code allowing vampires, werewolves and the like]—were on firm ground by this time.&quot; He also dismisses the end of the 12-cent comic book, which went to 15 cents as the industry standard in early 1969, noting that the 1962 hike from 10 cents to 12 cents had no bearing in this regard. Shutt&#x27;s line comes with &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #102 (September 1970), Jack Kirby&#x27;s last regular-run issue before the artist left to join DC Comics; this combines with DC&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; #229 (August 1970), editor Mort Weisinger&#x27;s last before retiring.
According to historian Peter Sanderson, the &quot;neo-silver movement&quot; that began in 1986 with &quot;&quot; by Alan Moore and Curt Swan, was a backlash against the Bronze Age with a return to Silver Age principles. In Sanderson&#x27;s opinion, each comics generation rebels against the previous, and the movement was a response to &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, which itself was an attack on the Silver Age. Neo-silver comics creators made comics that recognized and assimilated the more sophisticated aspects of the Silver Age.

==Legacy==
The Silver Age marked a decline in horror, crime, romance, talking animal humor, and Westerns as American-comics genres.

An important feature of the period was the development of the character makeup of superheroes. Young children and girls were targeted during the Silver Age by certain publishers; in particular, Harvey Comics attracted this group with titles such as &quot;Little Dot&quot;. Adult-oriented underground comics also began during the Silver Age.

Some critics and historians argue that one characteristic of the Silver Age was that science fiction and aliens replaced magic and gods. Others argue that magic was an important element of both Golden Age and Silver Age characters. Many Golden Age writers and artists were science-fiction fans or professional science-fiction writers who incorporated SF elements into their comic-book stories. Science was a common explanation for the origin of heroes in the Silver Age.

The Silver Age coincided with the rise of pop art, an artistic movement that used popular cultural artifacts, such as advertising and packaging, as source material for fine, or gallery-exhibited, art. Roy Lichtenstein, one of the best-known pop art painters, specifically chose individual panels from comic books and repainted the images, modifying them to some extent in the process but including in the painting word and thought balloons and captions as well as enlarged-to-scale color dots imitating the coloring process then used in newsprint comic books. An exhibition of comic strip art was held at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs of the Palais de Louvre in 1967, and books were soon published that contained serious discussions of the art of comics and the nature of the medium.

In January 1966, a live-action &quot;Batman&quot; television show debuted to high ratings. Circulation for comic books in general and Batman merchandise in particular soared. Other masked or superpowered adventurers appeared on the television screen, so that &quot;American TV in the winter of 1967 appeared to consist of little else but live-action and animated cartoon comic-book heroes, all in living colour.&quot; Existing comic-book publishers began creating superhero titles, as did new publishers. By the end of the 1960s, however, the fad had faded; in 1969, the best-selling comic book in the United States was not a superhero series, but the teen-humor book &quot;Archie&quot;.

Swedish cartoonist Joakim Lindengren draws a Silver Age pastiche in his &quot;Kapten Stofil&quot; comic book series (1998–2009) about the powers of nostalgia in a grumpy, old comic book named Captain Geezer who longs to return to the Silver Age. Lindengren also borrows many elements from Silver Age comics in United States of Banana, a comic book he created with Puerto Rican author Giannina Braschi.

==Artists==
Arlen Schumer, author of &quot;The Silver Age of Comic Book Art&quot;, singles out Carmine Infantino&#x27;s Flash as the embodiment of the design of the era: &quot;as sleek and streamlined as the fins Detroit was sporting on all its models&quot;. Other notable pencilers of the era include Curt Swan, Gene Colan, Steve Ditko, Gil Kane, Jack Kirby, Joe Kubert, Don Heck, George Tuska, Dick Ayers, and John Romita Sr.

Two artists that changed the comics industry dramatically in the late 1960s were Neal Adams, considered one of his country&#x27;s greatest draftsmen, and Jim Steranko. Both artists expressed a cinematic approach at times that occasionally altered the more conventional panel-based format that had been commonplace for decades. Adams&#x27; breakthrough was based on layout and rendering. Best known for returning Batman to his somber roots after the campy success of the Batman television show, his naturalistic depictions of anatomy, faces, and gestures changed comics&#x27; style in a way that Strausbaugh sees reflected in modern graphic novels.

One of the few writer-artists at the time, Steranko made use of a cinematic style of storytelling. Strausbaugh credits him as one of Marvel&#x27;s strongest creative forces during the late 1960s, his art owing a large debt to Salvador Dalí. Steranko started by inking and penciling the details of Kirby&#x27;s artwork on &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; beginning in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #151, but by &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #155 Stan Lee had put him in charge of both writing and drawing Fury&#x27;s adventures. He exaggerated the James Bond-style spy stories, introducing the vortex beam (which lifts objects), the aphonic bomb (which explodes silently), a miniature electronic absorber (which protected Fury from electricity), and the Q-ray machine (a molecular disintegrator)—all in his first 11-page story.

==Collectibility==
The following comics are sought after by collectors due to their historic significance. A near-mint-plus copy of &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15, the first appearance of Spider-Man, sold for $1.1 million to an unnamed collector on March 7, 2011.

==Footnotes==
Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961, Timely and Atlas publisher Martin Goodman was playing golf with either Jack Liebowitz or Irwin Donenfeld of rival DC Comics (then known as National Periodical Publications), who bragged about DC&#x27;s success with the Justice League of America, which had debuted in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #28 (Feb. 1960) before going on to its own title.

Film producer and comics historian Michael Uslan later contradicted some specifics, while supporting the story&#x27;s framework:

<text>Rodhocetus (from &quot;Rodho&quot;, the geological anticline at the type locality, and &quot;cetus&quot;, Latin for whale) is an extinct genus of protocetid early whale known from the Lutetian of Pakistan. The best-known protocetid, &quot;Rodhocetus&quot; is known from two partial skeletons that taken together give a complete image of an Eocene whale that had short limbs with long hands and feet that were probably webbed and a sacrum that was immobile with four partially fused sacral vertebrae. It is one of several extinct whale genera that possess land mammal characteristics, thus demonstrating the evolutionary transition from land to sea.

==Description==

&quot;Rodhocetus&quot; was a small whale measuring long. Throughout the 1990s, a close relationship between cetaceans and mesonychians, an extinct group of cursorial, wolf-like ungulates, was generally accepted based on morphological analyses. In the late 1990s, however, cladistic analyses based on molecular data clearly placed Cetacea within the Artiodactyla near the hippopotamus. One of the diagnostic characteristics of artiodactyls is the double-pulley astragalus (heel bone), and palaeontologists, unconvinced by the data from the labs, set themselves out to find archaeocete single-pulley heel bones. Hind legs from three archaeocete species were recovered within a few years, among them those of &quot;Rodhocetus balochistanensis&quot;, and all three had double-pulley heel bones, thus settling the cladistic controversy.

Through a principal components analysis demonstrated that &quot;Rodhocetus&quot; had trunk and limb proportions similar to the Russian desman, a foot-powered swimmer using its tail mainly as a rudder. From this Gingerich concluded that &quot;Rodhocetus&quot; was swimming mostly at the surface by alternate strokes of its hind feet, and that it was insulated by fur rather than blubber, as are &quot;Dorudon&quot; and modern cetaceans, which made it buoyant and incapable of deep diving.

===&quot;R. kasrani&quot;===
The holotype of &quot;R. kasrani&quot;, GSP-UM 3012 found in 1992, was described by : a cranium with two dentaries, most of the vertebral column as far as the anterior tail (C2–C7; T1–13; L1–6, S1–4, Ca1–4), most ribs, parts of the sternum, both hip bones, and a left femur. Gingerich et al. 1994 referred a specimen collected in 1981, GSP-UM 1852 two dentaries with teeth, to &quot;R. kasrani&quot;. The body mass of the holotype has been estimated between based on different techniques.

Derived traits in &quot;R. kasrani&quot;, relative to older archaeocetes such as &quot;Pakicetus&quot;, include high-crowned cheek teeth, larger auditory bullae, larger mandibular foramen, and mandibular canals. The higher neural spines and shorter femur (60–70%) distinguish &quot;Rodhocetus&quot; from the more primitive &quot;Ambulocetus&quot;. The convex posterior surface of the exoccipital, shorter cervical vertebrae, and unfused sacral vertebrae distinguishes &quot;R. kasrani&quot; from &quot;Indocetus&quot;. In contrast to later archaeocetes such as &quot;Protocetus&quot; and later cetaceans, &quot;Rodhocetus&quot; retains external nares above upper canines, high neural spines on anterior thoracic vertebrae, and four sacral vertebrae with sacroiliac joints similar to those in land-mammals (suggesting a hip joint that could support the body weight.)

Several cranial features identifies &quot;R. kasrani&quot; as an archaeocete: both the premaxillae and the dentaries are elongated, the frontal shield is wide, and the nuchal crest is high. The auditory bullae are large and dense but, there are no associated pterygoid fossae or air sinuses. The mandibular foramina are large with a pan bone long and high.

The specific name &quot;kasrani&quot; comes from Qaisrani, the Baloch tribe inhabiting the type locality. The protocetid &quot;Qaisracetus&quot; is also named after them.

===&quot;R. balochistanensis&quot;===
The fossil remains of &quot;R. balochistanensis&quot; were found in eastern Balochistan, Pakistan in 2001 by Philip Gingerich. Dating from about 47 million years ago, they are one of a series of recent discoveries, including the pakicetids, which have thrown considerable light on the previously mysterious evolutionary origin of whales.

The holotype of &quot;Rodhocetus balochistanensis&quot;, GSP-UM 3485, is:
* A weathered braincase found at the surface next to a partial dentary with an unfused mandibular symphysis, a characteristic of protocetids.
* Large parts of the axial skeleton including cervical, thoracic and proximal caudal vertebrae, but excluding sacral vertebrae.
* Forelimb material including the left distal humerus, radius and ulna, and two virtually complete hand skeletons including all carpal bones, unfused and lacking an os centrale, and phalanges.
* Parts of the pelvis including an acetabular rim.
* Hind limb material includes the right femur, patella, tibia, and possible partial fibula; two virtually complete foot skeletons include tarsal and metatarsal bones and phalanges. The astragalus (heel bone) is characteristic of artiodactyls with a deep tibial trochlea restricting lateral movements and a large calcaneal tuber (posterior part of heel bone) providing leverage for powerful extension. The metatarsals and phalanges are very long and thin and can not have been weight-bearing, suggesting that &quot;Rodhocetus&quot; was predominantly aquatic and on land must have walked on the plantar surface of the tarsals. The shape of the metatarsal and phalanges reveal that these bones could be tightly compressed during flexion and widely separated during extension.

The five-fingered hand of &quot;R. balochistanensis&quot; is mesaxonic (i.e. has a central digit) with three weight-bearing central digits equipped with nail-like hooves, flanked by two more slender digits lacking hooves (distal phalanges preserved on first, second, and fourth digits). The four-toed foot is paraxonic (i.e. central axis passes between the two central digits), with all four digits ending in pointed nails (distal phalanges preserved on second and third digits).

With an estimated body weight of , &quot;R. balochistanensis&quot; was 13% smaller than &quot;R. kasrani&quot; (), but its femur is larger.

<text>In Egyptian mythology, Khenti-kheti (also spelt Chenti-cheti), was a crocodile-god, though he was later represented as a falcon-god. His name means &quot;foremost retreater&quot;.

==Origin and evolution==
At earlier times, he was the crocodile god of the region called Athribis in Lower Egypt. This is why, in Egyptian history, he has often been associated with Sebek and is said to be &quot;The&quot; &quot;Owner of Athribis&quot;. However, during the New Kingdom, he was shown to be related to Horus and was shaped like a hawk. At that time his name was Horas Khenti-Kheti.

==Legend==
He could take the form of a giant black bull, named Kemwer. He was later replaced by Osiris, also known as &quot;Osiris, who lived in Athribis&quot;.

<text>Dedun (or Dedwen) was a Kushite or Nehasi (C-Group culture) god worshipped during ancient times in ancient Egypt and Sudan and attested as early as 2400 BC. There is much uncertainty about his original nature, especially since he was depicted as a lion, a role that usually was assigned to the son of another deity. Nothing is known of the earlier Kushite mythology from which the deity arose, however. The earliest known information in Egyptian writings about Dedun indicates that he already had become a god of incense by the time of the writings. Since at that historical point, incense was an extremely expensive luxury commodity, and Nubia was the source of much of it, he was quite an important deity. The wealth that the trade in incense delivered to Nubia led to his being identified by them as the god of prosperity and of wealth in particular.

Although he is mentioned in the Pyramid Texts of ancient Egypt as being a Nubian deity, there is no evidence that Dedun was worshipped by the Egyptians or that he was worshipped in any location north of Swenet (contemporary Aswan), which was considered the most southerly city of Ancient Egypt. Nevertheless, in the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, during the Egyptian rule over Kush, Dedun was said by the Egyptians to be the protector of deceased Nubian rulers and their god of incense, thereby associated with funerary rites.

Atlanersa, a Kushite ruler of the Napatan kingdom of Nubia, is known to have started a temple dedicated to the syncretic god Osiris-Dedun at Jebel Barkal.

<text>The impossible cube or irrational cube is an impossible object invented by M.C. Escher for his print &quot;Belvedere&quot;. It is a two-dimensional figure that superficially resembles a perspective drawing of a three-dimensional cube, with its features drawn inconsistently from the way they would appear in an actual cube.

==Usage in art==
In Escher&#x27;s &quot;Belvedere&quot; a boy seated at the foot of a building holds an impossible cube. A drawing of the related Necker cube (with its crossings circled) lies at his feet, while the building itself shares some of the same impossible features as the cube.

Other artists than Escher, including Jos De Mey, have also made artworks featuring the impossible cube.
A doctored photograph purporting to be of an impossible cube was published in the June 1966 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;, where it was called a &quot;Freemish crate&quot;. An impossible cube has also been featured on an Austrian postage stamp.

==Explanation==
The impossible cube draws upon the ambiguity present in a Necker cube illustration, in which a cube is drawn with its edges as line segments, and can be interpreted as being in either of two different three-dimensional orientations.

An impossible cube is usually rendered as a Necker cube in which the line segments representing the edges have been replaced by what are apparently solid beams.
In Escher&#x27;s print, the top four joints of the cube, and the upper of the two crossings between its beams, match one of the two interpretations of the Necker cube, while the bottom four joints and the bottom crossing match the other interpretation. Other variations of the impossible cube combine these features in different ways; for instance, the one shown in Escher&#x27;s painting draws all eight joints according to one interpretation of the Necker cube and both crossings according to the other interpretation.

The apparent solidity of the beams gives the impossible cube greater visual ambiguity than the Necker cube, which is less likely to be perceived as an impossible object. The illusion plays on the human eye&#x27;s interpretation of two-dimensional pictures as three-dimensional objects. It is possible for three-dimensional objects to have the visual appearance of the impossible cube when seen from certain angles, either by making carefully placed cuts in the supposedly solid beams or by using forced perspective, but human experience with right-angled objects makes the impossible appearance seem more likely than the reality.

<doc id="98295" wikidata="Q1586994" url="?curid=98295" title="Harsomtus">
<text>Harsomtus (also known as Harsomptus and Somtus) was an ancient Egyptian child god with main cult places at Dendera and Edfu. This less-known deity was worshipped from the Old Kingdom period all the way to Graeco-Roman Egypt. Popularity of Harsomtus, along with other child gods, greatly increased in the Graeco-Roman period, with most information coming from that era. The connection with Horus had formed early, and Harsomtus is considered by researchers to be a form of Ra or Horus. His name translates to &quot;Horus who unites the two lands.&quot;

==Iconography==

Harsomtus usually appears as a naked child sitting on a lotus flower. He can also appear as a snake that emerges from a lotus flower as seen in several reliefs at the temple of Dendera.

Due to connection with Horus, Harsomtus can appear with a falcon head. 

==Mythology==
Harsomtus simultaneously embodies sun, primordial, and creator god: the emergence of the world from the primordial matter is linked to the daily sunrise.

Harsomtus is the son of Hathor and Horus in the form of Heru-Behdeti, with these two gods he formed the Triad of Edfu. Harsomtus is very similar to Ihy because both were child deities that were the son of Hathor and Horus. 

In Thebes during the late New Kingdom, Harsomtus became the firstborn son of Amun and Hathor-chief-of-Thebes, a local Theban form of the goddess Hathor. He was worshiped in the Mammisi of the Hathor Temple in Deir el-Medina as well as in the Ptah Temple in Karnak. Hathor and Harsomtus were frequently equated with Isis and another childform of Horus named Hariese (&quot;Horus, the son of Isis&quot;).

<text>Aspen Hill is a census-designated place and an unincorporated area in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. It is located 6 miles north of Washington D.C. Its population as of the 2020 census was 51,063.

==Etymology==
The community name is derived from aspen trees that once were found near the first post office in the area. The post office was located in a general store on what was then known as the Washington-Brookeville Pike (now the intersection of Connecticut and Georgia Avenues) and opened &quot;circa&quot; 1864.

==History==
In the 1920s and 1930s, Aspen Hill was known as being the location of Aspin Hill Memorial Park, one of three pet cemeteries then operating on the East Coast of the United States. Burials at Aspen Hill Cemetery included dogs that had served the during World War I as well as the pets of area residents. Memorial ceremonies honoring pets were often held there on World Day for Animals.

In July 1950, Louis M. Denit sold of land in Aspen Hill to Gelman Construction Company for about $300,000. Denit was a well-known attorney who specialized in banking and trust law. Gelman Construction Company bought the land to build 2,450 three-bedroom ramblers, a shopping center, schools, playgrounds, and churches. The homes were priced at less $10,000 each.

In January 1955, Minnie Goodman sold of land in Aspen Hill to Metropolitan Homes, Inc. The land was the last vacant tract of land of its size between Rockville and Wheaton. Metropolitan Homes planned to build 12,000 homes, schools, shopping centers, and churches on the land. Prices for the homes started at $15,000 each.

Aspen Hill was one of the locations in which a fatal shooting took place in October 2002 as part of the Beltway sniper attacks.

==Geography== 
As a census-designated place, Aspen Hill&#x27;s boundaries are defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. The United States Postal Service does not accept “Aspen Hill” as a place name; addresses in the community must use the place names Rockville, Silver Spring, or Wheaton.

Some addresses use Wheaton (20906), notably in the Aspen Hill Shopping Center, while immediately across Aspen Hill Road at the Northgate Plaza Shopping Center, the addresses use Silver Spring (20906). Immediately to the west across Connecticut Avenue, addresses use Rockville (20853). As a result, crime statistics which are reasonably considered as belonging to Aspen Hill are buried in the statistics of three different areas. Aspen Hill straddles a corner where three statistical areas meet in what locals consider the commercial heart of Aspen Hill.

The United States Census Bureau, defines Aspen Hill as a census-designated place located at 39°6&#x27; North, 77°5&#x27; West. In the 2000 Census Bureau Gazetteer, Aspen Hill was located at (39.088525, −77.080267).

Other organizations, such as the Aspen Hill Civic Association, Inc. (AHCA) (2021), have their own definitions. For the most accurate boundaries and geographical map of the AHCA visit Aspen Hill Civic Association, Inc., Boundaries &amp; Map (AHCA) (2021). 
This an archived website from the early 2000&#x27;s Aspen Hill Civic Association, Inc.. The Aspen Hill Civic Association, Inc. has been serving the community since 1985 for over 35 years in Aspen Hill, Montgomery County, Maryland.

Other local resources such as the Montgomery Gazette and the Washington Post use a more broad definition. Generally speaking, if it is not a part of Manor Country Club or Leisure World, and is south of Norbeck Road and north of Veirs Mill Road, east of Rock Creek and west of Bel Pre Creek or Matthew Henson State Park or Matthew Henson Greenway, the local media consider it to be Aspen Hill.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the community has a total area of , of which is land and (0.57%) is water.
