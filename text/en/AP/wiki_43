<text>Brookline () is a town in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, United States, and part of the Boston metropolitan area. An exclave of Norfolk County, Brookline borders six of Boston&#x27;s neighborhoods: Brighton, Allston, Fenway–Kenmore, Mission Hill, Jamaica Plain, and West Roxbury. The city of Newton borders Brookline to the west. It is known for being the birthplace of John F. Kennedy.

The land which comprises what is today Brookline was first settled in 1638 as a hamlet in Boston, known as Muddy River (as it was settled on the west side of the river of the same name). It was incorporated as a separate town with the name of Brookline in 1705. In 1873, Brookline had a contentious referendum in which it voted to remain independent from Boston. The later annexations of Brighton and West Roxbury, both in 1874, and that of Hyde Park in 1912, eventually made Brookline into an exclave of Norfolk County. The town has a history of racial discrimination in zoning, which has led to a disproportionately wealthy population and a very low percentage of Black residents, at only 2.5%.

Several streets and railroads were laid out in the town in the 19th century. Today, these are Massachusetts Route 9 (locally Boylston St., which cuts the town in two) and the various branches of the MBTA&#x27;s Green Line. To the north of Route 9, the area is fairly urban; the southern part is much less so.

At the time of the 2020 census, the population of the town was 63,191. It has been the most populous municipality in Massachusetts to have a town (rather than city) form of government since Framingham changed to a city in 2018, following a 2017 referendum.

==History==
Once part of Algonquian territory, Brookline was first settled by European colonists in the early 17th century. The area was an outlying part of the colonial settlement of Boston and known as the hamlet of Muddy River. In 1705, it was incorporated as the independent town of Brookline. The northern and southern borders of the town were marked by two small rivers or brooks, which is the town&#x27;s namesake. The northern border with Brighton (which was itself part of Cambridge until 1807) was Smelt Brook. (That name appears on maps starting at least as early as 1852, but sometime between 1888 and 1925, the brook was covered over.) The southern boundary, abutting Boston, was the Muddy River.

In 1843, a racially restrictive covenant in Brookline forbade resale of property to &quot;any negro or native of Ireland.&quot;

The Town of Brighton was merged with Boston in 1874, and the Boston-Brookline border was redrawn to connect the new Back Bay neighborhood with Allston-Brighton. This merger created a narrow strip of land along the Charles River belonging to Boston, cutting Brookline off from the shoreline. It also put certain lands north of the Muddy River on the Boston side, including what are now Kenmore Square and Packard&#x27;s Corner. The current northern border follows Commonwealth Avenue, and on the northeast, St. Mary&#x27;s Street. When Frederick Law Olmsted designed the Emerald Necklace of parks and parkways for Boston in the 1890s, the Muddy River was integrated into the Riverway and Olmsted Park, creating parkland accessible by both Boston and Brookline residents.

Throughout its history, Brookline has resisted being annexed by Boston, in particular during the Boston–Brookline annexation debate of 1873. The neighboring towns of West Roxbury and Hyde Park connected Brookline to the rest of Norfolk County until they were annexed by Boston in 1874 and 1912, respectively, putting them in Suffolk County. Brookline is now separated from the remainder of Norfolk County.

Brookline has long been regarded as a pleasant and verdant environment. In the 1841 edition of the &quot;Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening&quot;, Andrew Jackson Downing described the area this way:
Brookline residents were among the first in the country to propose extending the vote to women. Benjamin F. Butler, in his 1882 campaign for governor, advocated the idea.

===Transportation history===
Two branches of upper Boston Post Road, established in the 1670s, passed through Brookline. Brookline Village was the original center of retail activity. In 1810, the Boston and Worcester Turnpike, now Massachusetts Route 9, was laid out, starting on Huntington Avenue in Boston and passing through the village center on its way west.

Steam railroads came to Brookline in the middle of the 19th century. The Boston and Worcester Railroad was constructed in the early 1830s, and passed through Brookline near the Charles River. The rail line is still in active use, now paralleled by the Massachusetts Turnpike. The Highland branch of the Boston and Albany Railroad was built from Kenmore Square to Brookline Village in 1847, and was extended into Newton in 1852. In the late 1950s, this became the Green Line D branch.

The portion of Beacon Street west of Kenmore Square was laid out in 1850. Streetcar tracks were laid above ground on Beacon Street in 1888, from Coolidge Corner to Massachusetts Avenue in Boston, via Kenmore Square. In 1889, they were electrified and extended over the Brighton border at Cleveland Circle. They would eventually become the Green Line C branch.

Due to the Boston Elevated Railway system, this upgrade from horse-drawn carriage to electric trolleys occurred on many major streets all over the region, and made transportation into downtown Boston faster and cheaper. Much of Brookline was developed into a streetcar suburb, with large, brick apartment buildings sprouting up along the new streetcar lines.

===Housing and zoning history===
Brookline has a history of racial covenants that blocked people of color and some ethnic minorities to own housing there. In the early 20th century, Brookline banned the construction of triple-decker housing, which was a form of housing popular with poor immigrant communities in the United States. Advocates for the ban justified the ban with anti-immigrant rhetoric.

In 1922, Prescott F. Hall, a Brookline resident who co-founded the Immigration Restriction League, petitioned the Brookline government to exclusively allow single-family housing. In 1924, the Brookline government enacted a zoning change to only permit single-family housing in most of the territory of Brookline. Many of the present-day apartment buildings in Brookline were constructed prior to this zoning change.

In 1970, the state authorized rent control in municipalities with more than 50,000 residents. Brookline, Lynn, Somerville, and Cambridge subsequently adopted rent control. Brookline began decontrolling units in 1991.

Brookline has a recent history of blocking multifamily housing construction. Since the 1970s, new housing construction has plunged in Brookline. It has enacted zoning changes that ban multifamily apartment buildings and limit the height of buildings. Proposals for new development frequently face onerous lawsuits. These restrictions on housing supply have led housing prices in Brookline to skyrocket in recent decades. In 2023, the median sale price for a single-family home in Brookline was $2.51 million, and the median condo price was $927,500.

As a consequence of restrictions on housing supply, Brookline is overwhelmingly wealthy. Only 2.5% of its population is Black, which is the second-lowest share of Black people in any community in the Boston area. Only 14% of Brookline teachers, 21% of Brookline police, and 22% of Brookline firefighters live in Brookline, as median salaries for these kinds of jobs make housing in Brookline largely unaffordable.

===Etymology===
Brookline was known as the hamlet of Muddy River and was considered part of Boston until the Town of Brookline was independently incorporated in 1705. (The Muddy River was used as the Brookline–Boston border at incorporation.) The name is said to derive from a farm therein once owned by Judge Samuel Sewall. Originally, the property of CPT John Hull and Judith Quincy Hull. Judge Sewall came into possession of this tract, which embraced more than 350 acres, through Hannah Quincy Hull (Sewall) who was the Hull&#x27;s only daughter. John Hull in his youth lived in Muddy River Hamlet, in a little house which stood near the Sears Memorial Church. Hull removed to Boston, where he amassed a large fortune for those days. Judge Sewall probably never lived on his Brookline estate.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Brookline has a total area of , (0.44%) of which is covered by water.

The northern part of Brookline, roughly north of the D-line tracks, is urban in character, as highly walkable and transit rich. The population density of this northern part of town is nearly , similar to the densest neighborhoods in nearby Cambridge, Somerville, and Chelsea, Massachusetts (the densest cities in New England), and slightly lower than that of central Boston&#x27;s residential districts (Back Bay, South End, Fenway, etc.). The overall density of Brookline, which also includes suburban districts and grand estates south of the D-line, is still higher than that of many of the largest cities in the United States, especially in the South and West. Brookline borders Newton (part of Middlesex County) to the west and Boston (part of Suffolk County) in all other directions; it is therefore noncontiguous with any other part of Norfolk County. Brookline became an exclave of Norfolk County in 1873, when the neighboring town of West Roxbury was annexed by Boston (and left Norfolk County to join Suffolk County). Brookline refused to be annexed by Boston after the Boston–Brookline annexation debate of 1873.

Brookline separates the bulk of the city of Boston (except for a narrow neck or corridor near the Charles River) from its westernmost neighborhoods of Allston–Brighton, which had been the separate town of Brighton until annexed by Boston in 1873.

<text>The Ranger program was a series of uncrewed space missions by the United States in the 1960s whose objective was to obtain the first close-up images of the surface of the Moon. The Ranger spacecraft were designed to take images of the lunar surface, transmitting those images to Earth until the spacecraft were destroyed upon impact. A series of mishaps, however, led to the failure of the first six flights. At one point, the program was called &quot;shoot and hope&quot;. Congress launched an investigation into &quot;problems of management&quot; at NASA Headquarters and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. After two reorganizations of the agencies, Ranger 7 successfully returned images in July 1964, followed by two more successful missions.

Ranger was originally designed, beginning in 1959, in three distinct phases, called &quot;blocks&quot;. Each block had different mission objectives and progressively more advanced system design. The JPL mission designers planned multiple launches in each block, to maximize the engineering experience and scientific value of the mission and to assure at least one successful flight. Total research, development, launch, and support costs for the Ranger series of spacecraft (Rangers 1 through 9) was approximately $170 million (equivalent to $ in ).

==Ranger spacecraft==
Each of the block III Ranger spacecraft had six cameras on board. The cameras were fundamentally the same with differences in exposure times, fields of view, lenses, and scan rates. The camera system was divided into two channels, P (partial) and F (full). Each channel was self-contained with separate power supplies, timers, and transmitters. The F-channel had two cameras: the wide-angle A-camera and the narrow angle B-camera. The P-channel had four cameras: P1 and P2 (narrow angle) and P3 and P4 (wide angle). The final F-channel image was taken between 2.5 and 5 seconds before impact (altitude about ) and the last P-channel image 0.2 to 0.4 seconds before impact (altitude about ). The images provided better resolution than was available from Earth-based views by a factor of 1000. The design and construction of the cameras was led by Leonard R Malling.

The Ranger program manager for the first six spacecraft was James D. Burke.

The camera preamplifiers of the Ranger program used Nuvistors.

==Mission list==
===Block 1 missions===
*Ranger 1, launched 23 August 1961, lunar prototype, launch failure
*Ranger 2, launched 18 November 1961, lunar prototype, launch failure

Block 1, consisting of two spacecraft launched into Earth orbit in 1961, was intended to test the Atlas-Agena launch vehicle and spacecraft equipment without attempting to reach the Moon.

Problems with the early version of the launch vehicle left Ranger 1 and Ranger 2 in short-lived, low-Earth orbits in which the spacecraft could not stabilize themselves, collect solar power, or survive for long. In 1962, JPL utilized the Ranger 1 and Ranger 2 design for the failed Mariner 1 and successful Mariner 2 deep-space probes to Venus.

===Block 2 missions===
*Ranger 3, launched 26 January 1962, lunar probe, spacecraft failed, missed Moon
*Ranger 4, launched 23 April 1962, lunar probe, spacecraft failed, Moon impact
*Ranger 5, launched 18 October 1962, lunar probe, spacecraft failed, missed Moon

Block 2 of the Ranger project launched three spacecraft to the Moon in 1962, carrying a TV camera, a radiation detector, and a seismometer in a separate capsule slowed by a rocket motor and packaged to survive its low-speed impact on the Moon&#x27;s surface. The craft weighed 331 kg. The three missions together demonstrated good performance of the Atlas/Agena B launch vehicle and the adequacy of the spacecraft design, but unfortunately not both on the same attempt. Ranger 3 had problems with both the launch vehicle and the spacecraft, missed the Moon by about 36,800 km, and has orbited the Sun ever since. Ranger 4 had a perfect launch, but the spacecraft was completely disabled. The project team tracked the seismometer capsule to impact just out of sight on the lunar far side, validating the communications and navigation system. Ranger 5 missed the Moon and was disabled. No significant science information was gleaned from these missions.

Around the end of Block 2, it was discovered that a type of diode used in previous missions produced problematic gold-plate flaking in the conditions of space. This may have been responsible for some of the failures.

===Block 3 missions===
*Ranger 6, launched 30 January 1964, lunar probe, Moon impact, cameras failed
*Ranger 7
**Launched 28 July 1964
**Impacted Moon 31 July 1964 at 13:25:49 UT
** - Mare Cognitum
*Ranger 8
**Launched 17 February 1965
**Impacted Moon 20 February 1965 at 09:57:37 UT
** - Mare Tranquillitatis (Sea of Tranquility)
*Ranger 9
**Launched 21 March 1965
**Impacted Moon 24 March 1965 at 14:08:20 UT
** - Alphonsus crater

Ranger&#x27;s Block 3 embodied four launches in 1964-65. These spacecraft boasted a television instrument designed to observe the lunar surface during the approach; as the spacecraft neared the Moon, it would reveal detail smaller than the best Earth telescopes could show, and finally dishpan-sized craters. The first of the new series, Ranger 6, had a flawless flight, except that the television system was disabled by an in-flight accident and could take no pictures.

The next three Rangers, with a redesigned television, were completely successful. Ranger 7 photographed its way down to target in a lunar plain, soon named Mare Cognitum, south of the crater Copernicus. It sent more than 4,300 pictures from six cameras to waiting scientists and engineers. The new images revealed that craters caused by impact were the dominant features of the Moon&#x27;s surface, even in the seemingly smooth and empty plains. Great craters were marked by small ones, and the small with tiny impact pockmarks, as far down in size as could be discerned—about . The light-colored streaks radiating from Copernicus and a few other large craters turned out to be chains and nets of small craters and debris blasted out in the primary impacts.

In February 1965, Ranger 8 swept an oblique course over the south of Oceanus Procellarum and Mare Nubium, to crash in Mare Tranquillitatis about distant from where Apollo 11 would land 4½ years later. It took more than 7,000 images, covering a wider area and reinforcing the conclusions from Ranger 7. About a month later, Ranger 9 came down in the diameter crater Alphonsus. Its 5,800 images, nested concentrically and taking advantage of very low-level sunlight, provided strong confirmation of the crater-on-crater, gently rolling contours of the lunar surface.

<text>Battlestar Galactica is an American science fiction media franchise created by Glen A. Larson. It began with the original television series in 1978, and was followed by a short-run sequel series, &quot;Galactica 1980&quot;, a line of book adaptations, original novels, comic books, a board game, and video games. A reimagined version aired as a two-part, three-hour miniseries developed by Ronald D. Moore and David Eick in 2003, followed by a 2004 television series, which aired until 2009. A prequel series, &quot;Caprica&quot;, aired in 2010.

All &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; productions share the premise that in a distant part of the universe, a human civilization has extended to a group of planets known as the Twelve Colonies, to which they have migrated from their ancestral homeworld of Kobol. The Twelve Colonies have been engaged in a lengthy war with the Cylons, a cybernetic race whose goal is the extermination of the human species. The Cylons offer peace to the humans, which proves to be a ruse. With the aid of a human named Baltar, the Cylons carry out a massive nuclear attack on the Twelve Colonies and the Colonial Fleet of starships that protect them, devastating the fleet, laying waste to the Colonies, and destroying all but a small remaining population. Survivors flee into outer space aboard a motley fleet of spaceworthy ships. Of the Colonial battle fleet, only the Battlestar &quot;Galactica&quot;, a gigantic battleship and spacecraft carrier, appears to have survived the attack. Under the leadership of Commander Adama, the &quot;Galactica&quot; and the pilots of &quot;Viper fighters&quot; lead a fugitive fleet of survivors in search of the fabled thirteenth colony known as Earth.

==Television series==
=== Original continuity ===

==== &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (1978–79) ====

Glen A. Larson, the creator and executive producer of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, claimed he had conceived of the &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; premise, which he called &quot;Adam&#x27;s Ark&quot;, during the late 1960s. As James E. Ford detailed in &quot;&quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; and Mormon Theology&quot;, a paper read at the Joint Conference of the American Culture and Popular Culture Associations on April 17, 1980 (and published as &quot;Theology in Prime Time Science Fiction: &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; and Mormon Doctrine&quot;, &quot;Journal of Popular Culture&quot; #17 [1983]: 83–87), the series incorporated many themes from Mormon theology, such as marriage for &quot;time and eternity&quot;, a &quot;council of twelve&quot;, a lost thirteenth tribe of humans, and a planet called Kobol (an anagram of Kolob), as Larson was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. However, he was unable to find financial backing for his TV series for a number of years. &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; was finally produced in the wake of the success of the 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The original Cylons of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, robotic antagonists bent on destroying all humankind, owe much to Fred Saberhagen&#x27;s berserker stories, including Saberhagen&#x27;s fictional race the Builders whose &quot;sliding single red eye&quot; became the signature design element for the Cylons.
Larson had envisioned &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; as a series of made-for-TV movies (a three-hour pilot program and two two-hour episodes) for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). A shortened version of the three-hour pilot, &quot;Saga of a Star World&quot;, was screened in Canadian theaters (before the TV series was telecast) and in American, European and Australian theaters later on. Instead of two additional TV movies, ABC decided to commission a weekly TV series of one-hour episodes.

In 1979 at the sixth annual People&#x27;s Choice Awards, the TV series won in the category of &quot;Best New TV Drama Series&quot;.

The first episode of the TV series (the long pilot TV movie) was broadcast on September 17, 1978. About 30 minutes before the scheduled end, that broadcast was interrupted by the signing of the Egyptian–Israeli Camp David Accords. After the interruption (which was nearly an hour in length), the episode picked back up where it left off.

During the eight months after the pilot&#x27;s first broadcast, 17 original episodes of the series were made (five of them two-part shows), equivalent to a standard 24-episode TV season. Citing declining ratings and cost overruns, ABC canceled &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; in April 1979. Its final episode &quot;The Hand of God&quot; was telecast on April 29, 1979.

==== &quot;Galactica 1980&quot; (1980) ====
During the autumn of 1979, ABC executives met with &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;″s creator Glen Larson to consider restarting the series. A suitable concept was needed to draw viewers, and it was decided that the arrival of the Colonial Fleet at present-day Earth would be the storyline. A new TV movie called &quot;Galactica 1980&quot; was produced. Again, it was decided this new version of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; would be made into a weekly TV series. Despite the early success of the premiere, this program failed to achieve the popularity of the original series, and it was canceled after just ten episodes.

In this 1980 sequel series, the Colonial fleet finds the Earth, and then it covertly protects it from the Cylons. This series was a quick failure due to its low budget (e.g., recycling footage from the 1974 Universal Studios movie &quot;Earthquake&quot; during a Cylon attack sequence), widely panned writing, and ill-chosen time slot (Sunday evenings, a time generally reserved for family-oriented programming and, more specifically, also for the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; newsmagazine program). The TV series also had to adhere to strict content restrictions such as limiting the number of acts of violence and being required to shoehorn educational content into the script and dialogue.

To cut costs, the show was set mostly on the contemporary Earth, to the great dismay of fans. Another factor for fan apathy was the nearly complete recasting of the original series: Lorne Greene reprised his role as Adama, Herb Jefferson Jr. played &quot;Colonel&quot; Boomer in about half of the episodes (with little screentime), and Dirk Benedict as Starbuck for one episode (the abrupt final episode, though his character was to have also appeared in the unfilmed episode &quot;Wheel of Fire&quot;, which was a semi-sequel to &quot;The Return of Starbuck&quot;). Richard Hatch (Apollo in the original series) was sent a script for &quot;Galactica 1980&quot;, but he turned it down since he was not sure what his part in the series would be now that all the characters had changed.

Some TV syndication packages for &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; incorporate the episodes of this series.

=== Reimagined continuity ===

==== Miniseries (2003) ====

Despite attempts to revive the series over the years, none came to fruition until it was reimagined in 2003 by Universal Television as &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, a three-hour miniseries where a long-standing armistice following a war between humans and Cylons is broken by a second Cylon War, when the machines launch a sneak attack wiping out virtually all of humanity. Commissioned by the Sci-Fi Channel, screenwriter Ronald D. Moore and producer David Eick were the creative forces behind it. Academy Award-nominated actor Edward James Olmos was cast in the role of Commander Adama, while two-time Academy Award nominee Mary McDonnell was cast as President Laura Roslin. Starbuck and Boomer were now female characters, portrayed by Katee Sackhoff and Grace Park respectively. Other cast members included Jamie Bamber (Captain Lee &#x27;Apollo&#x27; Adama), James Callis (Dr. Gaius Baltar), and Tricia Helfer as a Cylon-humanoid known as &quot;Number Six&quot;. The mini-series was a ratings success for the Sci-Fi Channel and they commissioned a new weekly &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; series to follow.

==== &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (2004–09) ====

The new television series was co-funded by the UK&#x27;s Sky Television, and premiered in the United Kingdom on the Sky1 satellite channel in October 2004. The series was then broadcast in North America on the Sci-Fi Channel in January 2005. Continuing where the 2003 mini-series left off, the main cast all returned to reprise their roles. Several new characters were introduced, and Richard Hatch, who played Captain Apollo in the 1970s &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; TV series, also appeared in several episodes as Tom Zarek, a former political terrorist who later becomes part of the new Colonial government.

An edited version of the pilot miniseries was aired on NBC on January 9, 2005, five days before the Sci-Fi series premiere. NBC also aired three selected first-season episodes to promote the show in advance of the second-season premiere in July 2005. The series ran for four seasons between 2004 and 2009. The second season was split into two halves screened several months apart. Due to production delays caused by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild strike, the fourth season was also split into two parts, with a seven-month hiatus in between.

The series has won widespread critical acclaim among many mainstream non-SF-genre publications. &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;New York Newsday&quot; named it the best show on television in 2005. Other publications such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine also gave the show positive reviews.

The show has received a Peabody Award for overall excellence, several Emmy Awards for Visual Effects, and Emmy nominations for Writing and Directing. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named it one of the 100 Best TV Shows of All Time.

==== &quot;Caprica&quot; (2010) ====
&quot;Caprica&quot; is a prequel television series to the re-imagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. It premiered on Syfy (formerly Sci-Fi) on January 22, 2010, and was described as &quot;television&#x27;s first science fiction family saga&quot;. It was a two-hour back door pilot for a possible weekly television series, but on December 2, 2008, Syfy gave the go-ahead to expand the project into a full, 20-episode series. &quot;Caprica&quot; is set on the titular planet, 58 years before the events of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. The show revolves around two families, the Adamas and the Graystones, and the creation of the Cylons.

The pilot was directed by Jeffrey Reiner and starred Eric Stoltz, Esai Morales, Paula Malcomson, Alessandra Torresani, and Polly Walker. The pilot was released on DVD on April 21, 2009, and the series was broadcast in January 2010.

On October 27, 2010, Syfy canceled &quot;Caprica&quot; due to low ratings. The final five episodes were aired in the US on January 4, 2011, though they had aired a couple of months earlier on the Canadian network Space. The entire series was released on DVD in 2011.

== Web series ==

=== &quot;The Resistance&quot; (2006) ===
The first set of webisodes were a series of shorts produced in 2006 to promote the third season of the re-imagined show. Made as an &quot;optional extra&quot; to Season 3, the webisodes filled in some of the events between the second and third seasons and featured some of the main cast, though did not reveal what would happen in the beginning of Season 3, nor was viewing them essential to follow the story of the third season. Each of the ten webisodes was approximately three minutes long, and they were released twice a week leading up to the U.S. Season 3 premiere in 2006.

=== &quot;Razor Flashbacks&quot; (2007) ===
The &quot;Razor Flashbacks&quot; were a series of seven webisodes produced in 2007, set some 40 years earlier during William Adama&#x27;s fighter pilot days during the later stages of the First Cylon War. They were released on the Internet as &quot;webisodes&quot; leading up to &quot;Razor&quot; release. They are now available on the DVD and Blu-Ray releases of &quot;Battlestar Galactica: Razor&quot;, and some are inserted into both the broadcast and extended cuts of the movie on DVD and Blu-Ray. The installments that did not make the final cut include 1, 2, and the latter half of 7.

=== &quot;The Face of the Enemy&quot; (2008) ===
A set of ten webisodes were released during the seven-month hiatus between episodes 10 and 11 of Season 4. Titled &quot;The Face of the Enemy&quot;, the web series premiered on December 12, 2008, on SciFi.com.

===&quot;Blood &amp; Chrome&quot; (2012)===
&quot;Battlestar Galactica: Blood &amp; Chrome&quot; was to be a spin-off series from the re-imagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; series. Syfy approached show runner Ronald D. Moore to produce another spin-off set in the reimagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; universe, which was to begin as a two-hour pilot focused on William &quot;Husker&quot; Adama (portrayed by Luke Pasqualino) during the First Cylon War (as was glimpsed in &quot;Razor&quot; and the corresponding webisodes).

Syfy decided against moving forward with the &quot;Blood and Chrome&quot; TV series, but aired a 10-part webseries over four weeks via Machinima.com, beginning on November 9, 2012. The webseries was also aired as a 2-hour movie on Syfy on February 10, 2013, and was released on DVD shortly afterwards.

==Films==
===&quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;===
&quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; is a re-edit of the pilot episode of the 1978 TV series, &quot;Saga of a Star World&quot;. It was released theatrically in Canada before the television series aired in the United States, in order to help recoup its high production costs. Later, the standalone film edit was also released in the United States.

===&quot;Razor&quot;===
&quot;Battlestar Galactica: Razor&quot; is a 2007 television movie produced and broadcast in the gap between Seasons 3 and 4 of the re-imagined series. &quot;Razor&quot; is also the first two episodes of Season 4 though it chronicles events on Battlestar &quot;Pegasus&quot; in two time periods, both of which are &quot;in the past&quot; with respect to the Season 4 continuity. The &quot;present day&quot; framing scenes are set during Lee Adama&#x27;s command of the &quot;Pegasus&quot; in the latter half of Season 2, while &quot;flashback&quot; scenes depict Helena Cain&#x27;s command in the period between the Cylon attack (shown in the 2003 mini-series) and the reunion with the &quot;Galactica&quot; in the second season. It aired in the United States and Canada on November 24, 2007, and in the UK and Ireland on December 18, 2007. An expanded version of the movie was released on DVD on December 4, 2007.

===&quot;The Plan&quot;===
Sci Fi Channel produced a two-hour TV movie which was planned to air after the final episode of the series in 2009. The movie began production on September 8, 2008. The movie premiered exclusively on DVD, Blu-ray and digital download on October 27, 2009 and aired on January 10, 2010, on Sci Fi. Written by Jane Espenson and directed by Edward James Olmos, &quot;The Plan&quot; storyline begins before the attack on the Twelve Colonies and shows events primarily from the perspective of the Cylons. Edward James Olmos reprised his role as Adama, and ten of the eleven actors who played Cylons appeared, including Michael Trucco, Aaron Douglas, Dean Stockwell, Tricia Helfer, Grace Park, Rick Worthy, Matthew Bennett, Callum Keith Rennie, Michael Hogan and Rekha Sharma. The only &quot;Cylon&quot; actor not present was Lucy Lawless (although previously filmed footage of her was included).

===Feature film===
In 1999, the producer of &quot;Wing Commander&quot;, Todd Moyer, and the producer of the original TV series, Glen Larson, planned to produce a motion picture based on the TV series. It would have featured Battlestar &quot;Pegasus&quot;.

Creator Glen A. Larson entered negotiations with Universal Pictures for a film adaptation of the 1978 series in February 2009. Bryan Singer signed on to direct the reboot the following August, but was obliged to direct &quot;Jack the Giant Slayer&quot;. In October 2011 John Orloff was hired to write the script. &quot;I have wanted to write this movie since I was 12 years old, and built a Galactica model from scratch out of balsa wood, cardboard, old model parts and LEDs&quot;, Orloff told &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot;. By August 2012 the script was being rewritten, with Singer explaining that &quot;It will exist, I think, quite well between the Glen Larson and Ron Moore universes&quot;. On April 7, 2014, the studio hired Jack Paglen to write the script for the film. On February 12, 2016, Universal signed Michael De Luca, Scott Stuber and Dylan Clark to produce the &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; film. On June 9, 2016, Lisa Joy was reportedly writing the film, and Francis Lawrence was in talks to direct. On December 18, 2018, it was reported that Jay Basu (&quot;The Girl in the Spider&#x27;s Web&quot;) had been hired to rewrite Joy&#x27;s script. On October 22, 2020, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Simon Kinberg will be writing and co-producing the film with Dylan Clark.

===Cinema releases===
Besides a re-edited version of the pilot, released in Canada, Europe, parts of Latin America, and, following the broadcast of the series, in the U.S., two other &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; feature films were released in cinemas. &quot;Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack&quot; and &quot;Conquest of the Earth&quot; were made up of various episodes of the original series and &quot;Galactica 1980&quot; respectively. (See List of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (1978 TV series) and &quot;Galactica 1980&quot; episodes § Theatrical releases)

==Attempted revivals==
The original series maintained a cult fandom, which supported efforts by Glen A. Larson, Richard Hatch, and Bryan Singer (independently of one another) to revive the premise.

=== Battlestar Galactica: The Second Coming ===
Richard Hatch produced a demonstration video in 1998 to 1999 which featured several actors from the original series combined with state-of-the-art special effects. This video, titled &quot;Battlestar Galactica: The Second Coming&quot;, was screened at some science fiction conventions, but it did not lead to a new series.

=== Brian Singer Revival ===
In 2000, the director and an executive producer of the &quot;X-Men&quot; movie, Bryan Singer and Tom DeSanto, began developing a &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; TV miniseries under the auspices of Studios USA for the Fox TV network. A continuation of the original series but set 25 years later, Singer and DeSanto&#x27;s version included several members of the original cast reprising their original roles and the introduction of newer characters. It was intended to be telecast as a backdoor pilot in May 2002, and pre-production commenced and sets had even been partially constructed with a view to filming starting in November 2001. However, production delays caused by the September 11, 2001 attacks meant that Bryan Singer had to drop out, due to his commitment to direct the &quot;X-Men 2&quot; movie. This caused the executives of Fox TV to cancel the project.

=== Proposed Peacock series ===
In September 2019, NBCUniversal was planning a new series as part of their Peacock streaming service, set in the same continuity as the 2004 &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; series, and produced by Sam Esmail. In March 2021, writer and producer Michael Lesslie had reportedly left the project, leaving production plans in doubt. In July 2024, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Peacock were no longer developing the series, though the project was planned to be shopped to other networks.

==Books==
Both the original and the reimagined series have had books published about the series, academically oriented analysis, novelizations, and new works based on the characters.

===Original series books===
These &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; softcover novelisations were written by Glen A. Larson with the authors listed below. They were critically disparaged, but proved popular, with the first novel selling over a million copies within its first year. The first ten novels adapt the episode of the same title except as indicated. All novels except &quot;Battlestar Galactica 14: Surrender the Galactica!&quot; (ACE publishing) were originally published by Berkley, and have been republished, recently, by I Books, which called them &quot;Battlestar Galactica Classic&quot; to differentiate it from the reimagined series. The episodic novels featured expanded scenes, excerpts from &quot;The Adama Journals&quot;, more background on the characters, and the expansion of the ragtag fleet to almost 22,000 ships as opposed to the 220 in the TV series.

A new book series written by series star Richard Hatch starting in the 1990s continued the original story based on his attempt to revive the series, and ignored the events of &quot;Galactica 1980&quot;. His series picked up several years after the TV series ended, and featured Apollo in command of the &quot;Galactica&quot; after the death of Adama, a grown-up Boxey, who was now a Viper pilot, and the rediscovery of Commander Cain and the battlestar &quot;Pegasus&quot;, who had started a new colony and was preparing to restart the war with the Cylons.

==Comic books==
A series of comic book publishers have adapted &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; since its inception.

Marvel Comics published a 23-issue comic book series based upon the show between 1978 and 1981. Walt Simonson, who later wrote and drew &quot;Thor&quot; and had a long stint on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic, was the artist for the series at its conclusion. Other comics have since been published by Maximum Press, Grandreams, &quot;Look-in&quot; magazine, Realm Press, and Dynamite Comics.

Dynamite Entertainment was the last company to publish comic books featuring both the classic and reimagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; series. They also released a 4-issue &quot;Galactica 1980&quot; comic miniseries written by Marc Guggenheim. The limited miniseries was a re-imagining of the original series but at the end featured a second, smaller &quot;Battlestar&quot; (replacing the original which was destroyed) also named &quot;Galactica&quot; but strongly resembling the ship seen in the reimagined Sci-Fi Channel series.

==Games==

=== Video games ===

In 1978, Mattel Electronics released a handheld electronic LED game based on the series. The player tries to defend &quot;Galactica&quot; from kamikaze Cylon Raiders by manipulating a switch on the game unit to direct their fire, triggered by a red button to the left of the unit.

In November 2003, shortly before the premiere of the re-imagined TV series, Sierra released a 3D space combat &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; computer game for the original Xbox, PlayStation 2, and PC. The game took place 40 years before the original series and featured an ensign Adama flying a Viper during the Cylon war. The game was developed by Warthog.

There is also a 2D Xbox 360 Live Arcade title called &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; wherein players can co-op or dogfight with up to 8 people over Xbox Live.

&quot;Battlestar Galactica Online&quot; was a 3D browser-based MMOG released as an open beta on February 8, 2011, by Bigpoint Games.

&quot;Battlestar Galactica Deadlock&quot; is a 2017 3D turn based strategy game (released on PC, Xbox One and PS4) featuring the First Cylon War. The game is developed by Black Lab Games and published by the Slitherine Software.

=== Tabletop games ===
The original series inspired a &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; board game. The game is set during a training mission, where two to four players maneuver pieces representing Colonial Vipers to capture a damaged Cylon Raider. Play includes using terrain elements and a number of special-ability cards to the players&#x27; advantage.

In 1979, FASA released a tabletop counter piece game for &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; based on the fighter combat, which included the &quot;Galactica&quot; and a Cylon Basestar to be launched from, attack with and be attacked/defended. The counters for the Vipers and the Raiders included three model versions MKI/MKII/MKIII, not just the MKII Viper and Raider MKI.

Wiz Kids, Inc. (a collectible game manufacturer) produced the &quot;Battlestar Galactica Collectible Card Game&quot; based on the 2003 mini-series and 2004 TV show. The premier set of this game was released in May 2006. After the release of one expansion set, Wizkids cancelled the game on March 13, 2007.

A &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; role-playing game was released in August 2007 by Margaret Weis Productions at Gen Con.

In 2008 Fantasy Flight Games produced &quot;Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game&quot;, based on the 2003 re-imagined series. It is a semi-cooperative game of strategy for 3–6 players with some players being Cylon agents, either aware at start of the game or become aware later, as sleeper agents. Each of the 10 playable character has its own abilities and weaknesses, and they must all work together in order for humanity to survive, as well as attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threaten to tear the fleet apart. The game had three expansions, &quot;Pegasus&quot;, &quot;Exodus&quot; and &quot;Daybreak&quot;.

In 2018, Ares Games released &quot;Battlestar Galactica: Starship Battles&quot;, a miniature game by Andrea Angiolino and Andrea Mainini simulating space duels between Vipers and Raiders, with expansions including further models. The game is based on the 2003 re-imagined series, but the license will also allow use of spaceships from the original series, with a game approach similar to Wings of War.

Battle of Galactica opened June 9, 1979, as an event on the Studio Tour at Universal Studios Hollywood at a cost of $1 million, the most expensive special effects attraction ever built at the park at the time. This high-technology attraction featured animatronics and live actors in a spectacular laser battle based on the television series, with a 200-foot long spaceship that &quot;swallowed&quot; the passengers. This was the first themed attraction to feature Audio-Animatronics characters outside Disney Parks, and was the first dark ride to combine sophisticated animatronics and lasers with live actors. It was replaced in 1992 by the foundations of &quot;Back to the Future: The Ride&quot;.

A Battlestar Galactica: Human vs. Cylon roller coaster opened March 18, 2010, at Universal Studios Singapore.

<text>Major-General Sir Isaac Brock KB (6 October 1769 – 13 October 1812) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator from Guernsey. Brock was assigned to Lower Canada in 1802. Despite facing desertions and near-mutinies, he commanded his regiment in Upper Canada (part of present-day Ontario) successfully for many years. He was promoted to major general, and became responsible for defending Upper Canada against the United States. While many in Canada and Britain believed war could be averted, Brock began to ready the army and militia for what was to come. When the War of 1812 broke out, the populace was prepared, and quick victories at Fort Mackinac and Detroit defeated American invasion efforts.

Brock&#x27;s actions, particularly his success at Detroit, earned him accolades including a knighthood in the Order of the Bath and the sobriquet &quot;The Hero of Upper Canada&quot;. His name is often linked with that of the Native American leader Tecumseh, although the two men collaborated in person only for a few days. Brock died at the Battle of Queenston Heights, which the British won.

==Early life==
Brock was born at St Peter Port on the Channel Island of Guernsey, the eighth son of John Brock (1729–1777), a midshipman in the Royal Navy, and Elizabeth de Lisle, daughter of Daniel de Lisle, then Lieutenant-Bailiff of Guernsey. The Brocks were an English family who had been established in Guernsey since the sixteenth century. Brock earned a reputation during his early education on Guernsey as an assiduous student, as well as an exceptional swimmer and boxer. At age ten, he was sent to school in Southampton. He also studied for one year in Rotterdam, learning French.

Despite his lack of an extensive formal education, Brock appreciated its importance. As an adult, he spent much time reading in an attempt to improve his education. He read many works on military tactics and science, but he also read ancient history and other less immediately practical topics. At the time of his death, he owned a modest library of books, including classic works by Shakespeare, Voltaire, and Samuel Johnson.

He kept a reputation as an &quot;unusually tall, robust&quot; man throughout his life, with an adult height of about . Measurements taken from his uniform show that at his death he had a waist size of and the inside brim of his hat measured in circumference. Though Brock was noted as a handsome man who enjoyed the company of women, he never married.

==Military service==
Brock had a successful pre-war military career and a quick rise through the ranks, which many commented on at the time. Some credited luck and others skill in his rapid promotions, and Brock had substantial portions of both on his way to prominence. Lacking special political connections, Brock&#x27;s ability to gain promotions even when the nation was at peace attests to his skills in recruiting men and organising finances, and ambition.

===Early career===

At the age of fifteen, Brock joined the 8th (The King&#x27;s) Regiment of Foot on 8 March 1785 with the rank of ensign, and was likely given responsibility for the regimental colours. His elder brother John was already an officer in the same regiment. As was usual at the time, Brock&#x27;s commission was purchased. On 16 January 1790 he bought the rank of lieutenant and later that year he raised his own company of men. As a result, he was promoted to captain (of an Independent Company of foot) on 27 January 1791 and transferred to the 49th (Hertfordshire) Regiment of Foot on 15 June 1791.

His nephew and biographer (Ferdinand Brock Tupper) asserts that shortly after Brock joined the regiment, a professional dueller forced a match on him. As the one being challenged Brock had his choice of terms, and he insisted that they use pistols. His friends were shocked as Brock was a large target and his opponent an expert shot. Brock, however, refused to change his mind. When the duellist arrived at the field, he asked Brock to decide how many paces they would take. Brock insisted that the duel would take place not at the usual range, but at handkerchief distance (i.e., close range). The duellist declined and subsequently was forced to leave the regiment. This contributed to Brock&#x27;s popularity and reputation among his fellow officers, as this duellist had a formidable reputation and was reportedly regarded as a bully in the regiment. During his time with this regiment, Brock served in the Caribbean, where he fell ill with fever and nearly died. He did not fully recover until after returning to England in 1793.

Once back in Britain he spent much of his time recruiting, and he was placed in charge of recruits on Jersey. He purchased his majority on 27 June 1795, and rejoined his regiment in 1796, when the rest of his men returned from the West Indies.

===First command===
On 28 October 1797 Brock purchased the rank of lieutenant-colonel for £3,000, and became acting commanding officer of the regiment, assuming substantive command on 22 March 1798 with the retirement of Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Keppel. The rank was apparently bought cheaply; his predecessor from whom he purchased the rank was advised to sell up and leave the army rather than face a court martial and probable dismissal.

In 1799 the 49th was assigned to the Helder Expedition against the Batavian Republic (now known as the Netherlands), to be led by Sir Ralph Abercromby. During the troop landings, Brock saw his first combat on 10 September 1799 under the command of then-Major-General John Moore. Given that the 49th was in poor shape when Brock took command, they saw little actual combat. Likely Moore was sparing them and using more experienced troops to establish the beachhead. Finally on 2 October the 49th was actively involved in heavy combat at the Battle of Alkmaar, where they acquitted themselves well, sustaining only 33 deaths.

The 49th had been ordered to proceed up the beaches of Egmont-op-Zee, a steep climb through sand dunes and poor terrain. The risks were exacerbated by harassment from French sharpshooters, who had excellent cover. After about six hours of heavy fighting, the attack was stopped about a mile (1.6 km) short of the British objective. After an hour of close combat, the French began to withdraw. Brock was injured in the fighting when hit in the throat by a spent musket ball. His neck cloth prevented a possibly fatal injury. In his own words, &quot;I got knocked down shortly after the enemy began to retreat, but never quitted the field, and returned to my duty in less than half an hour.&quot;

In 1801 while aboard the 74-gun (commanded by Captain Thomas Fremantle, a personal friend), Brock was present at the Battle of Copenhagen. His troops were supposed to lead an assault on the forts at Copenhagen. The outcome of the sea battle made such an assault unnecessary, and Brock was able to observe first-hand the tactical brilliance of Lord Nelson. After the battle, Fremantle and Brock celebrated the victory with Nelson. In 1802, Brock and the 49th were ordered to Canada.

===Transfer to Canada===
Brock arrived in Canada with the rest of the 49th and was initially assigned to Montreal. Almost immediately, in 1804 he was faced with one of the primary problems in Canada: desertion. Seven soldiers stole a boat and fled across the river (and border) into the United States. Despite having no jurisdiction on American soil, Brock sent a party across the border in pursuit and the men were captured.

===Mutiny===
A short time later Brock received a report from Fort George that some of the garrison were planning to imprison the officers and flee to the U.S. Immediately he boarded the schooner that had brought the message and proceeded to Fort George, under the command of then-Lieutenant-Colonel Roger Hale Sheaffe. A hastily assembled honour guard formed to greet Brock&#x27;s unexpected arrival. Alone on entering the fort, Brock ordered the sergeant of the guard to disarm and had him confined.

As it was the dinner hour, all the soldiers were in barracks. Brock ordered the drummers to call out the men. He ordered the first officer on the scene, Lieutenant Williams, to bring him a soldier suspected of being one of the mutiny&#x27;s ringleaders. Pinning the man with a sabre, Williams took him into custody. The other suspected mutineers were also captured.

Brock sent the twelve mutineers and the seven deserters to Quebec for court martial. The mutineers had planned to jail all the officers (save Sheaffe, who was to be killed) and to cross the Niagara River into the U.S. at Queenston. Seven soldiers were subsequently executed by firing squad. The mutineers testified that they were forced to such measures by the severity of Sheaffe&#x27;s command. They said if they had continued under Brock&#x27;s command, they would never have taken such action. Brock was evidently upset by the news that the conspirators had been shot. In a botched execution, the firing squad discharged their weapons at too long a distance, so that the condemned men were not killed instantly.

Brock&#x27;s younger brother John Savery Brock was compelled to retire from the Royal Navy after his involvement in a mutinous incident; he induced &quot;his brother midshipmen of the fleet at Spithead to sign a round robin against their being subjected to the practice of mast-heading.&quot; He was &quot;recommended privately to retire from the service.&quot;

===Pre-war preparations===

After a period of leave in England over winter 1805–1806 and promotion to colonel on 29 October 1805, Brock returned to Canada temporarily in command of the entire British army there. By 1806 the United States was becoming increasingly hostile to the British Empire; relations between the two nations continued to deteriorate until war finally broke out in 1812.

The United States had grievances at British violations of American sovereignty, restriction of American trade by Britain, and an American desire to gain territory by invading and annexing the poorly defended British North American colonies. American grievances included the impressment of American sailors by the Royal Navy, the blockade of French ports, and a belief that the British were inciting American Indians to attack U.S. settlements on the western frontier. War hawks in the U.S. called for an invasion of Canada to punish the British Empire and to lessen the threat to American interests represented by the Native Americans. At the same time, the US leaders believed that the growing population needed new territory; some imagined that the United States was destined to control all of the North American continent. (This philosophy was later known as Manifest Destiny.) American hawks assumed that Canadian colonists would rise up and support the invading U.S. armies as liberators and that, as Thomas Jefferson famously wrote, conquering Canada would be &quot;a mere matter of marching&quot;.

In response to this emerging threat, Brock moved quickly to bolster Canadian defences. He strengthened the fortifications of Quebec by building walls and an elevated battery. Brock succeeded in creating a formidable defensive position due largely to his military reading, which included several volumes on the science of running and setting up artillery. He also rearranged and strengthened the Provincial Marine (responsible for transport on the lakes and rivers). He ordered warships to be built and developed a naval force capable of holding the Great Lakes. This was to be pivotal during the war. But Brock&#x27;s appropriation of civilian lands and labour for military use brought him into conflict with the civilian authorities led by Thomas Dunn.

In 1807 Brock was appointed brigadier general by Governor General Sir James Henry Craig, the new commander of Canadian forces. He was to take command of all forces in Upper Canada in 1810. During this time Brock continued to ask for a posting in Europe. In June 1811 he was promoted to major general and in October of that year Lieutenant Governor Francis Gore left for England. Brock was sent to Upper Canada as senior officer commander of the troops and senior member of the [executive] council, putting him fully in charge of both the military and civil authority. He was usually referred to as president of the council or administrator of Upper Canada (never as lieutenant governor). When permission to leave for Europe finally came in early 1812, Brock declined the offer, believing he had a duty to defend Canada in war against the United States.

As Upper Canada&#x27;s administrator, Brock made a series of changes to prepare for war. He amended the militia act to allow use of all available volunteers and ordered enhanced training of these raw recruits, despite opposition from the provincial legislature. He continued strengthening and reinforcing defences. Brock also began seeking out First Nations leaders, such as the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, to build alliances with him against the Americans in the event of war. Although the conventional wisdom of the day was that Canada would fall quickly in the event of an invasion, Brock pursued these strategies to give the colony a fighting chance.

Meanwhile, back in England, Brock&#x27;s brother William faced financial difficulties, as the bank in which he was a senior partner failed. Isaac&#x27;s commissions had been purchased with a loan entered into the bank&#x27;s books by his brother, and the Brocks faced a demand for payment. Isaac could not meet the £3000 debt, but made over the whole of his salary to his brother Irving, to be used for whatever was considered most critical: his commission debt or the family&#x27;s other bills.

==War of 1812==

===Early war and the capture of Detroit===
The United States declared war on Britain on 18 June 1812. Despite his preparations, Brock was worried about Canadian security. In Upper Canada, besides the militia, there was only one British regular infantry regiment, a detachment of retired veterans, and a company of artillery. These had to be dispersed among several widely separated posts. Brock&#x27;s advantage was that the armed vessels of the Provincial Marine controlled the lakes, and allowed him to move his reserves rapidly between threatened points.

Brock continually kept the commanders of his posts informed of all developments. When news of the outbreak of war reached him, he sent a canoe party under the noted trader and voyager William McKay to the British outpost at St. Joseph Island on Lake Huron. His orders to commander (Captain Charles Roberts) allowed him to stand on the defensive or attack the nearby American outpost at Fort Mackinac at his discretion. Roberts immediately launched an attack on Fort Mackinac with a scratch force of regulars, fur traders, and First Nations warriors. On 17 July, the American garrison was taken by surprise (not being aware that war had been declared) and surrendered. This victory immediately encouraged many First Nations tribes, who had hitherto been neutral or undecided, to give their active support to the British. They hoped to expel the American settlers from their territories west of the Appalachian Mountains.

Brock felt he needed to go further. He was hampered by Governor General George Prevost, who had replaced Craig in late 1811. Prevost&#x27;s orders from the government, and his own inclinations, were to emphasise defence. Prevost kept the bulk of his forces in Lower Canada to protect Quebec, and opposed any attack into United States. Brock also believed that he was handicapped by inertia and defeatism among the legislature and other officials.

He wrote to Prevost&#x27;s adjutant general,
My situation is most critical, not from anything the enemy can do, but from the disposition of the people – The Population, believe me is essentially bad – A full belief possesses them that this Province must inevitably succumb – This Prepossession is fatal to every exertion – Legislators, Magistrates, Militia Officers, all, have imbibed the idea, and are so sluggish and indifferent in all their respective offices that the artful and active scoundrel is allowed to parade the Country without interruption, and commit all imaginable mischief... What a change an additional regiment would make in this part of the Province! Most of the people have lost all confidence – I however speak loud and look big.

On 12 July, an American army under William Hull had invaded Canada at Sandwich (later known as Windsor). The invasion was quickly halted, and Hull withdrew, but this gave Brock the excuse he needed to abandon Prevost&#x27;s orders. Having finally obtained limited support from the legislature for his measures to defend the Province, Brock prorogued the Assembly and set out on 6 August with a small body of regulars and some volunteers from the York Militia (the &quot;York Volunteers&quot;) to reinforce the garrison at Fort Malden – Amherstburg at the western end of Lake Erie, facing Hull&#x27;s position at Detroit. Travelling mainly by water in bad weather, Brock reached Amherstburg on 13 August.

Here, Brock met Tecumseh, and was immediately impressed. Brock also read American dispatches captured from Hull&#x27;s army. He quickly judged Hull to be timid and afraid of the First Nations in particular, and the American force to be demoralised and short of rations. Against the advice of his officers, Brock immediately prepared to launch an attack on Detroit.

He later (3 September) wrote to his brothers,
Some say that nothing could be more desperate than the measure, but I answer that the state of the Province admitted of nothing but desperate remedies. I got possession of the letters my antagonist addressed to the Secretary at War, and also of the sentiments which hundreds of his army uttered to their friends. Confidence in the General was gone, and evident despondency prevailed throughout. I have succeeded beyond expectation. I crossed the river contrary to the opinion of Cols. Procter, St. George etc.; it is therefore no wonder that envy should attribute to good fortune what in justice to my own discernment, I must say, proceeded from a cool calculation of the &quot;pours&quot; and &quot;contres&quot;.

Even with his First Nations allies, Brock was outnumbered. His force included 600 &quot;Indians&quot; and 1300 soldiers, as well as two battleships, according to his later report. Hull had 2,500 soldiers under his command.

He decided to use tricks to intimidate Hull. He dressed his militia contingent in uniforms discarded by his regulars, making it appear (at a distance) as if his force consisted entirely of British regular infantry. Brock laid siege to Fort Detroit, from established artillery positions across the river in Sandwich. Through a carefully crafted series of marches, he gave the appearance of having much more numerous forces. He had Tecumseh&#x27;s forces cross in front of the fort several times (doubling back under cover), intimidating Hull with the show of a large, raucous, barely controlled group of First Nations warriors. Finally, he sent Hull a letter demanding his surrender, in which he stated, in part, &quot;It is far from my inclination to join in a war of extermination, but you must be aware that the numerous body of Indians who have attached themselves to my troops will be beyond my control the moment the contest commences.&quot; Brock hammered the fort with cannon fire.

On 16 August, the day after receiving Brock&#x27;s letter, Hull surrendered. Hull, elderly and without recent military experience, was terrified by the risk of losing the battle.
 He later wrote that the surrender had saved 2,500 troops and 700 civilians from &quot;the horrors of an Indian massacre&quot;.

The capture of Detroit and Hull&#x27;s army wounded American morale, and eliminated the main American force in the area as a threat, while at the same time boosting morale among his own forces. Brock took the American supplies at Detroit and used them for his own forces, particularly the ill-equipped militia. Under prize regulations, a substantial part of the value of the captured military stores would accrue to him. (If he had lived longer, he could have settled his debts.) Brock valued the captured ordnance supplies at £30,000. Finally, the victory secured the support of Tecumseh and the other chiefs in his confederation, who took Brock&#x27;s actions as both a sign of competence and a willingness to take action.

Tecumseh evidently trusted and respected Brock, reportedly saying, &quot;This is a &quot;man&quot;&quot; after meeting him for the first time. Although Brock&#x27;s correspondence indicates a certain amount of paternal condescension for the First Nations, he seems to have regarded Tecumseh very highly, calling him &quot;the Wellington of the Indians&quot;, and saying &quot;a more sagacious or a more gallant warrior does not I believe exist&quot;. Brock made a number of commitments to the Shawnee. He promised to negotiate no peace treaty without addressing the Shawnee&#x27;s vision of an independent homeland. There is no evidence Brock negotiated in bad faith. Brock&#x27;s personal integrity and respect for First Nations peoples has been well documented, and suggest that if he had lived he would have kept his word to the Shawnee.

The capture of Detroit led to British domination over most of Michigan Territory. Brock had planned to continue his campaign into the U.S., but he was thwarted by negotiation of an armistice by Prevost with American Major General Henry Dearborn. This stalled Brock&#x27;s momentum, and gave the Americans time to regroup and prepare to invade Canada. Unable to predict the point of invasion, Brock frantically worked to prepare defences throughout Upper Canada.

The Prince Regent decreed a silver medal be struck for presentation to the senior officers to commemorate the event.

===Death at Battle of Queenston Heights===

Meanwhile, American general Stephen Van Rensselaer III, a Federalist political appointee, in command of a sizable army near Lewiston, was pressured by the American president to invade. Although Van Rensselaer had severe doubts about the quality of his troops, he had no choice but to attack. He was an inexperienced militia general, and not trusted by the majority of regular army troops. In the early morning of 13 October 1812, he attempted to cross the Niagara River, leading to the Battle of Queenston Heights. Despite heavy fire from British artillery, the first wave of Americans (under Captain John E. Wool) managed to land, and then follow a fishermen&#x27;s path up to the heights. From this point, they attacked and routed the British artillery. Brock had arrived from nearby Fort George and moved up to the artillery battery to gain a better view only minutes before Wool attacked. He, his aides, and the gunners were forced to beat a hasty retreat, leading their horses down the steep slope.

Fearing that the Americans would move the rest of their troops across the river, Brock ordered an immediate attack on their position. True to his philosophy of never ordering men where he would not lead them, he personally led the charge on foot. Brock&#x27;s charge was made by Dennis&#x27; and Williams&#x27; two companies of the 49th and two companies of militia. The assault was halted by heavy fire and as he noticed unwounded men dropping to the rear, Brock shouted angrily that &quot;This is the first time I have ever seen the 49th turn their backs! Surely the heroes of Egmont will not tarnish their record!&quot; At this rebuke, the ranks promptly closed up and were joined by two more companies of militia, those of Cameron and Heward. Brock saw that the militia supports were lagging behind at the foot of the hill and ordered one of his Provincial aides-de-camp, Lieutenant Colonel John Macdonell, to &quot;Push on the York Volunteers,&quot; while he led his own party to the right, presumably intending to join his party with that of Williams&#x27; detachment, who were beginning to make progress on that flank.

Brock was struck in the wrist of his sword arm by a musket ball but continued to press home the attack. His height and energetic gestures, together with his officer&#x27;s uniform and a gaudy sash given to him eight weeks earlier by Tecumseh after the siege of Detroit, made him a conspicuous target. An unknown American stepped forward from a thicket and fired at a range of barely fifty yards. The musketball struck Brock in the chest and he fell. His last words have been reported as &quot;Push on, brave York Volunteers&quot; (in reference to a group of the militia Brock favoured) or &quot;Push on, don&#x27;t mind me&quot; or &quot;Surgite!&quot; (Latin for &quot;rise&quot; or &quot;push on&quot;  – now used as a motto by Brock University), and even &quot;a request that his fall might not be noticed or prevent the advance of his brave troops, adding a wish, which could not be distinctly understood, that some token of remembrance should be transmitted to his sister.&quot; These accounts are considered unlikely, since he was not in the company of the York Volunteers but regular soldiers at the time and it is also reported that Brock died almost immediately without speaking, and the hole in his uniform suggests that the bullet entered his heart. His body was carried from the field and secreted in a nearby house at the corner of Queenston and Partition streets, diagonally opposite that of Laura Secord.

Following the death of Brock, Lieutenant-Colonel John Macdonell became the senior officer. A lawyer by trade and having little military experience, Macdonell led a second attempt to retake the redan. With Williams&#x27; men of the 49th starting from brush to the right of the line near the escarpment and Macdonell&#x27;s anchoring the left, the force of between 70 and 80 men (more than half of whom were militia) advanced toward the redan. Wool had been reinforced by more troops who had just made their way up the path to the top of the Heights, and Macdonell faced some four hundred troops. During the charge, it is reported that the 49th used &quot;Revenge the General&quot; as a battle cry.

Despite the disadvantage in numbers as well as attacking a fixed position, Williams&#x27; and Macdonell&#x27;s small force was driving the opposing force to the edge of the gorge on which the redan was situated, and seemed on the verge of success before the Americans were able to regroup and stand firm. The momentum of the battle turned when a musket ball hit Macdonell&#x27;s mount (causing it to rear and twist around) and another shot hit him in the small of the back, causing him to fall from the horse. He was removed from the battlefield and died from his injuries early the next day. Captain Williams was laid low by a wound to the head, and Dennis by a severe wound to the thigh (although he continued to lead his detachment throughout the action). Carrying Macdonnell and the body of Brock, the British fell back through Queenston to Durham&#x27;s Farm, a mile north near Vrooman&#x27;s Point.

In the afternoon, Sheaffe arrived on the battlefield with reinforcements and took command of the British forces. In sharp contrast to his predecessors&#x27; direct attacks, Sheaffe took a more cautious approach. This ultimately proved successful, leading to a total victory over the Americans.

===Burial===

After the battle, Sheaffe and his staff decided to entrust the funeral arrangements to Captain John Glegg, who had served with Brock for many years. On 16 October, a funeral procession for Brock and Colonel Macdonell went from Government House to Fort George, with soldiers from the British Army, the colonial militia, and First Nations warriors on either side of the route. The caskets were lowered into a freshly dug grave at the northeast corner of Fort George. The British fired a twenty-one gun salute in three salvos, in a gesture of respect. Later that day, the American garrison at Fort Niagara respectfully fired a similar salute. Over five thousand people attended the funeral, a remarkable number given the limited population of Upper Canada at that time.

A small cairn at the foot of the Niagara Escarpment marks the spot where Brock fell. In 1824, Brock&#x27;s and Macdonell&#x27;s remains were moved into Brock&#x27;s Monument, which overlooked the Queenston Heights. That original monument was bombed and heavily damaged in 1840. (This action was reputedly by Irish-Canadian terrorist Benjamin Lett although a subsequent Assize failed to confirm this.). It was replaced by a larger structure high, built at public expense, that still stands. Brock&#x27;s remains were reinterred inside the new Monument on 13 October 1853. An inscription reads: &quot;Upper Canada has dedicated this monument to the memory of the late Major-General Isaac Brock, K.B. provisional lieutenant-governor and commander of the forces in the province whose remains are deposited in the vault beneath. Opposing the invading enemy he fell in action near these heights on 13 October 1812, in the forty-third year of his age. Revered and lamented by the people whom he governed and deplored by the sovereign to whose services his life had been devoted.&quot;

==Legacy==
===On British leadership===

British military leadership, which had been decisive up to Brock&#x27;s death, suffered a blow with his loss. His direct successor, Major-General Sheaffe, although successful in his approach at Queenston Heights, was never able to live up to Brock&#x27;s reputation. He was criticised by many, including John Strachan, for his retreat at the Battle of York, and was shortly after recalled to England, where he continued a successful, if not brilliant, military career.

Brock&#x27;s successor at Detroit, however, fared much worse. Colonel Henry Procter faced an attack from a resurrected American Army of the Northwest under future President William Henry Harrison. Harrison set out to retake Detroit, but a detachment of his army was defeated at Frenchtown on 22 January 1813. Procter, displaying poor judgement, left the prisoners in the custody of his First Nations allies, who proceeded to execute an indeterminate number of them. Subsequent American victories allowed Harrison to attempt another invasion of Canada, which led to the Battle of the Thames on 5 October 1813. After a successful American charge, Procter&#x27;s forces turned and fled, leaving Tecumseh and his American Indian troops to fight alone. They fought on, eventually being defeated. Perhaps of more importance to the British, at this battle Tecumseh died, and their alliance with the American Indians effectively ended.

As for Governor General Prevost, who often clashed with Brock, he remained in command of all British forces until after the Battle of Plattsburgh, in 1814. The battle was intended to be a joint naval/infantry attack, but Prevost did not commit his forces until after the naval battle had nearly ended. When he finally did attack, his forces proved unable to cross the Saranac River bridge, which was held by a small group of American regulars under the command of the recently promoted John E. Wool. Despite a heavy advantage in manpower, Prevost finally retreated upon hearing of the failure of the naval attack. For his failure at Plattsburgh, Prevost was recalled to England to face an inquiry, and a naval court martial determined that the blame for the loss at Plattsburgh primarily rested with Prevost. Prevost&#x27;s health failed him, and he died in early 1816.

===In Britain===

Although Brock&#x27;s achievements in Canada were overshadowed by larger-scale fighting in Europe, his death was still widely noted, particularly in Guernsey. In London, he is remembered at a memorial in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. This was paid for by £1575 voted by the House of Commons, which also granted pensions of £200 to each of his four surviving brothers. For his actions in the capture of Detroit, Brock was appointed a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath (KB) on 10 October 1812. He died at the Battle of Queenston Heights before learning of his knighthood.

As a mark of esteem, the Prince Regent made a special grant to allow the heraldic supporters that would have been incorporated into his coat of arms if he had lived, to be incorporated into the arms of Brock&#x27;s father&#x27;s descendants, and on monuments raised in Brock&#x27;s memory.

A British naval vessel named in his honour, HMS &quot;Sir Isaac Brock&quot;, was destroyed at the Battle of York while under construction to prevent it falling into enemy hands. The Regimental Depot of the 49th of Foot (later the Royal Berkshire Regiment), was established at Reading and named Brock Barracks in his memory in 1934. It is now used as a cadets and reserve infantry centre.

===In Canada===
Canadians regard Brock as one of their greatest military heroes. He was voted number 28 on the television show &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot;, although he was not born or naturalised as a Canadian.

Although many Canadians have come to view Brock as one of their own, Brock never really felt at home in Canada. On the whole, he viewed the country as a backwater, and earnestly wished to return to Europe to fight against Napoleon. Brock mistrusted the Canadian colonists, many of whom he suspected of being American sympathisers, and he was reluctant to arm them indiscriminately to help defend the colonies. He favoured expansion of volunteer forces which could be trained and supervised, as well as the use of British regulars and Tecumseh&#x27;s warriors.

Since his death, several legends and myths about Brock have arisen. In 1908, the story of Brock&#x27;s betrothal to Sophia Shaw, the daughter of General Æneas Shaw, was first published. There is no supporting evidence for the claim and most biographers consider it apocryphal. A legend about Brock&#x27;s horse Alfred was first published in 1859. The horse was supposedly shot and killed during the battle while being ridden by Macdonell, and it is commemorated in a monument erected in 1976 in Queenston near the cairn marking the spot where Brock fell. But little evidence supports this account. The General&#x27;s horse &quot;fully caparisoned, led by four Grooms,&quot; is listed as preceding the coffin at the General&#x27;s interment at Fort George.

In 1816, an unknown company issued a series of private half-penny tokens honouring Brock with the title &quot;The Hero of Upper Canada&quot;. Private copper tokens became common in Canada due to initial distrust of &quot;army bills&quot;, paper notes issued by Brock when there was a currency shortage caused by economic growth.

Brockville and Brock in Ontario, Brock in Saskatchewan, General Isaac Brock Parkway on Highway 405 and Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario, are all named in tribute to Brock. Schools named in his honour include one in Winnipeg, and public schools in Toronto, Guelph, Hamilton, London, Vancouver, and Windsor, Ontario. An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate Major-General Sir Isaac Brock&#x27;s role in Ontario&#x27;s heritage. The section of Spadina Avenue south of Queen Street in Toronto was once named Brock Street in his honour.

In September 2012, the Royal Canadian Mint issued a .99999 pure gold coin with a face value of 350 dollars to honor the bicentenary of Brock&#x27;s death. The reverse design was taken from a half-penny token issued in 1816 as a memorial to Brock. In addition, there have been quarters that have been released, one with a coloured maple leaf and the other with a frosted maple leaf.

The Bathurst Street Bridge was renamed the Sir Isaac Brock Bridge by the City of Toronto at the suggestion of the Friends of Fort York.

===In Guernsey===
Brock&#x27;s childhood home on High Street, St Peter Port, Guernsey still stands, and is marked with a memorial plaque. A memorial, paid for by Canada, is fitted into the side of the Town Church, the parish church of St Peter Port.

Brock University in Ontario provides scholarships to Guernsey students who achieve sufficiently high grades. In 1969, the Guernsey Post Office issued postage stamps to commemorate his life and achievements.

<text>A found object (a calque from the French &quot;objet trouvé&quot;), or found art, is art created from undisguised, but often modified, items or products that are not normally considered materials from which art is made, often because they already have a non-art function. Pablo Picasso first publicly utilized the idea when he pasted a printed image of chair caning onto his painting titled &quot;Still Life with Chair Caning&quot; (1912). Marcel Duchamp is thought to have perfected the concept several years later when he made a series of readymades, consisting of completely unaltered everyday objects selected by Duchamp and designated as art. The most famous example is &quot;Fountain&quot; (1917), a standard urinal purchased from a hardware store and displayed on a pedestal, resting on its back. In its strictest sense the term &quot;readymade&quot; is applied exclusively to works produced by Marcel Duchamp, who borrowed the term from the clothing industry () while living in New York, and especially to works dating from 1913 to 1921.

Found objects derive their identity as art from the designation placed upon them by the artist and from the social history that comes with the object. This may be indicated by either its anonymous wear and tear (as in collages of Kurt Schwitters) or by its recognizability as a consumer icon (as in the sculptures of Haim Steinbach). The context into which it is placed is also a highly relevant factor. The idea of dignifying commonplace objects in this way was originally a shocking challenge to the accepted distinction between what was considered &quot;art&quot; as opposed to &quot;not art&quot;. Although it may now be accepted in the art world as a viable practice, it continues to arouse questioning, as with the Tate Gallery&#x27;s Turner Prize exhibition of Tracey Emin&#x27;s &quot;My Bed&quot;, which consisted literally of a transposition of her unmade and disheveled bed, surrounded by shed clothing and other bedroom detritus, directly from her bedroom to the Tate. In this sense the artist gives the audience time and a stage to contemplate an object. As such, found objects can prompt philosophical reflection in the observer ranging from disgust to indifference to nostalgia to empathy.

As an art form, found objects tend to include the artist&#x27;s output—at the very least an idea about it, i.e. the artist&#x27;s designation of the object as art—which is nearly always reinforced with a title. There is usually some degree of modification of the found object, although not always to the extent that it cannot be recognized, as is the case with readymades. Recent critical theory, however, would argue that the mere designation and relocation of any object, readymades included, constitutes a modification of the object because it changes our perception of its utility, its lifespan, or its status.

== History ==
=== Antecedents ===

One curator considers East Asian scholar&#x27;s rocks to be early examples of found objects. Found and collected in natural settings, the rocks are changed only minimally for display, seldom beyond the addition of a display stand, and are meant to be contemplated as idealized representations of nature. Geological processes, chief among them erosion, give the rocks their distinctive qualities, rather than any modification by an artist or artisan.

In 2017–2018, the French expert found and identified seventeen unpublished works in a private collection, classified as a national treasure on May 7, 2021, by the French Ministry of Culture, including &quot;Des souteneurs encore dans la force de l&#x27;âge et le ventre dans l&#x27;herbe&quot; by Alphonse Allais&quot;,&quot; consisting of a green carriage curtain suspended from a wooden cylinder. This work was certainly exhibited at the Incoherents exhibitions in Paris between 1883 and 1893. According to Johann Naldi, this work is the oldest known readymade and was a source of inspiration for Marcel Duchamp.

=== Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;readymades&quot; ===
Marcel Duchamp coined the term &quot;readymade&quot; in 1915 to describe a common object that had been selected and not materially altered in any way. Duchamp assembled &quot;Bicycle Wheel&quot; in 1913 by attaching a common front wheel and fork to the seat of a common stool. This was not long after his &quot;Nude Descending a Staircase&quot; was attracting the attention of critics at the International Exhibition of Modern Art. In 1917, &quot;Fountain&quot;, a urinal signed with the pseudonym &quot;R. Mutt&quot;, and generally attributed to Duchamp, confounded the art world. In the same year, Duchamp indicated in a letter to his sister, Suzanne Duchamp, that a female friend was centrally involved in the conception of this work. As he writes: &quot;One of my female friends who had adopted the pseudonym Richard Mutt sent me a porcelain urinal as a sculpture.&quot; Irene Gammel argues that the piece is more in line with the scatological aesthetics of Duchamp&#x27;s friend, the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, than Duchamp&#x27;s. The other possible, and more probable, &quot;female friend&quot; is Louise Norton (later Varèse), who contributed an essay to &quot;The Blind Man&quot; discussing &quot;Fountain&quot;. Norton, who recently had separated from her husband, was living at the time in an apartment owned by her parents at 110 West 88th Street in New York City, and this address is partially discernible (along with &quot;Richard Mutt&quot;) on the paper entry ticket attached to the object, as seen in Stieglitz&#x27;s photograph.

Research by Rhonda Roland Shearer indicates that Duchamp may have fabricated his found objects. Exhaustive research of mundane items like snow shovels and bottle racks in use at the time failed to reveal identical matches. The urinal, upon close inspection, is non-functional. However, there are accounts of Walter Arensberg and Joseph Stella being with Duchamp when he purchased the original &quot;Fountain&quot; at J. L. Mott Iron Works.

=== Later development ===

The use of found objects was quickly taken up by the Dada movement, being used by Man Ray and Francis Picabia who combined it with traditional art by sticking combs onto a painting to represent hair. A well-known work by Man Ray is &quot;Gift&quot; (1921), which is an iron with nails sticking out from its flat underside, thus rendering it useless. Jose de Creeft began making large-scale assemblages in Paris, such as &quot;Picador&quot; (1925), made of scrap metal, rubber and other materials.

The combination of several found objects is a type of readymade sometimes known as an assemblage. Another such example is Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;Why Not Sneeze, Rose Sélavy?&quot;, consisting of a small birdcage containing a thermometer, cuttlebone, and 151 marble cubes resembling sugar cubes.

By the time of the Surrealist Exhibition of Objects in 1936 a whole range of sub-classifications had been devised—including found objects, ready-made objects, perturbed objects, mathematical objects, natural objects, interpreted natural objects, incorporated natural objects, Oceanic objects, American objects and Surrealist objects. At this time Surrealist leader, André Breton, defined readymades as &quot;manufactured objects raised to the dignity of works of art through the choice of the artist&quot;.

In the 1960s, found objects were present in both the Fluxus movement and in pop art. Joseph Beuys exhibited modified found objects; examples include rocks with a hole in them stuffed with fur and fat, a van with sledges trailing behind it, and a rusty girder.

In 1973, Michael Craig-Martin claimed of his work &quot;An Oak Tree&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s not a symbol. I have changed the physical substance of the glass of water into that of an oak tree. I didn&#x27;t change its appearance. The actual oak tree is physically present, but in the form of a glass of water.&quot;

==Other types of found objects==
===Commodity sculpture===

In the 1980s, a variation of found objects emerged called &quot;commodity sculpture&quot; where commercially mass-produced items would be arranged in the art gallery as sculpture. The focus of this variety of sculpture was on the marketing, display of products. These artists included Jeff Koons, Haim Steinbach, and Ashley Bickerton (who later moved on to do other kinds of work).

One of Jeff Koons&#x27; early signature works was &quot;Two Ball 50/50 Tank&quot;, 1985, which consisted of two basketballs floating in water, which half-fills a glass tank.

===Trash art===

A specific subgenre of found objects is known as trash art or junk art. These works primarily comprise components that have been discarded. Often they come quite literally from the trash. One example of trash art is trashion, fashion made from trash. Marina DeBris takes trash from the beach and creates dresses, vests, and other clothes. Many organizations sponsor junk art competitions. Trash art may also have a social purpose, of raising awareness of trash.

Creating and using trash art can expose people to hazardous substances. For instance, older computer and electronic components can contain lead (in solder and insulation). Jewelry made from these items may require careful handling. In France, trash art became known as &quot;Poubellisme&quot;, art made from contents of &quot;poubelles&quot; (trash bins).

Artists who create art from trash include:
*Spanish artist Francisco de Pajaro (&quot;Art is trash&quot; or &quot;&quot;)
*Australian artist Paul Yore, who uses trash to create a kind of &quot;kitsch queerness&quot;, &quot;bad taste aesthetic&quot;, in order to challenge people&#x27;s perceptions, and to examine excess consumption in society.

=== In music ===
Found objects can also be used as musical instruments. It is an important part of the &quot;musique concrète&quot; genre.

Found sounds have been used by acts including Cop Shoot Cop, Radiohead, Four Tet, The Books, and Björk. The musician Cosmo Sheldrake, who uses found sounds from the natural world in his music, has stated that incorporating the &quot;soundscape&quot; of ecosystems into music may be an effective means of communicating important messages about issues such as climate change.

==Criticism==
The found object in art has been a subject of polarised debate in Britain throughout the 1990s due to the use of it by the Young British Artists. It has been rejected by the general public and journalists, and supported by public museums and art critics. In his 2000 Dimbleby lecture, &quot;Who&#x27;s afraid of modern art&quot;, Sir Nicholas Serota advocated such kinds of &quot;difficult&quot; art, while quoting opposition such as the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; headline &quot;For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all&quot;. A more unexpected rejection in 1999 came from artists—some of whom had previously worked with found objects—who founded the Stuckists group and issued a manifesto denouncing such work in favour of a return to painting with the statement &quot;Ready-made art is a polemic of materialism&quot;.

<text>The National Trust () is a heritage and nature conservation charity and membership organisation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The Trust was founded in 1895 by Octavia Hill, Sir Robert Hunter and Hardwicke Rawnsley to &quot;promote the permanent preservation for the benefit of the Nation of lands and tenements (including buildings) of beauty or historic interest&quot;. It has since been given statutory powers, starting with the National Trust Act 1907. Historically, the Trust acquired land by gift and sometimes by public subscription and appeal, but after World War II the loss of country houses resulted in many such properties being acquired either by gift from the former owners or through the National Land Fund.

One of the largest landowners in the United Kingdom, the Trust owns almost of land and of coast. Its properties include more than 500 historic houses, castles, archaeological and industrial monuments, gardens, parks, and nature reserves. Most properties are open to the public for a charge (members have free entry), while open spaces are free to all. The Trust has an annual income of over £680 million, largely from membership subscriptions, donations and legacies, direct property income, profits from its shops and restaurants, and investments. It also receives grants from a variety of organisations including other charities, government departments, local authorities, and the National Lottery Heritage Fund.

==History==
===Founders===
The Trust was incorporated on 12 January 1895 as the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty, which is still the organisation&#x27;s legal name. The founders were social reformer Octavia Hill, solicitor Sir Robert Hunter and clergyman Hardwicke Rawnsley.

In 1876, Hill, together with her sister Miranda Hill, had set up a society to &quot;diffuse a love of beautiful things among our poor brethren&quot;. Named after John Kyrle, the Kyrle Society campaigned for open spaces for the recreational use of urban dwellers, as well as having decorative, musical, and literary branches. Hunter had been solicitor to the Commons Preservation Society, while Rawnsley had campaigned for the protection of the Lake District. The idea of a company with the power to acquire and hold buildings and land had been mooted by Hunter in 1894.

In July 1894 a provisional council, headed by Hill, Hunter, Rawnsley and the Duke of Westminster met at Grosvenor House and decided that the company should be named the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. Articles of association were submitted to the Board of Trade and on 12 January 1895, the Trust was registered under the Companies Act. Its purpose was to &quot;promote the permanent preservation for the benefit of the Nation of lands and tenements (including buildings) of beauty or historic interest&quot;.

===Early years===
The Trust acquired its first land in early 1895; Dinas Oleu, on the clifftop above Barmouth in Wales, was donated by Fanny Talbot, a friend of Rawnsley. The Trust&#x27;s first building was acquired the following year; Alfriston Clergy House, a 14th-century house in the Sussex village of Alfriston, was bought for £10 and required a further £350 for repairs.

In 1907 Hunter drafted the first National Trust Act, which was passed by Parliament and gave the Trust the power to declare its land inalienable, meaning that it could not be sold without parliamentary approval. In addition, the Act enabled the Trust to make by-laws. Further Acts would follow in 1919, 1937, 1939, 1953, and 1971.

In the early days, the Trust was concerned primarily with the acquisition (by gift or purchase) of open spaces and a variety of threatened buildings. The buildings were generally of modest size, an exception being Barrington Court in Somerset, the Trust&#x27;s first large country house. Two of the sites acquired by the Trust in its early years later became nature reserves: Wicken Fen in Cambridgeshire and Blakeney Point in Norfolk, both purchased with the help of a donation by naturalist and banker Charles Rothschild. White Barrow on Salisbury Plain was the Trust&#x27;s first archaeological monument, purchased in 1909 for £60.

By 1914 the Trust, operating out of a small office in London, had 725 members and had acquired 63 properties, covering .

===Expansion===
In 1920 the Trust lost the last of its three founders, Rawnsley. The Trust&#x27;s of land in the Lake District were augmented by gifts in his memory, including part of the Great Wood on Derwentwater. In 1923 literary critic John Bailey took over as chairman of the Trust. Under his chairmanship, the Trust saw an increase in funds, membership, and properties. The 1920s saw the acquisition of more archaeological sites, including Cissbury Ring in West Sussex, and early buildings, including two medieval castles (Bodiam Castle in East Sussex and Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire) bequeathed to the Trust by Lord Curzon. In 1925 the Trust launched a national appeal to buy the Ashridge Estate in Hertfordshire, successfully raising a record £80,000. When Bailey died in 1931 &quot;The Times&quot; paid tribute to him: &quot;The strong position which the National Trust now occupies is largely due to him, and it will perhaps never be known how many generous gifts of rural beauty and historic interest the nation owes, directly or indirectly, to his persuasive enthusiasm.&quot;

The Trust, which already owned a large area of the Lake District, acquired its first piece of land in the Peak District in 1930. Four years later, Ilam Hall was presented to the Trust for use as a youth hostel. The 1930s saw an expansion of the Trust&#x27;s interest in coastal conservation, with more than thirty small coastal properties in Devon and Cornwall alone given to the Trust. In 1934 the Trust acquired its first village, West Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, which was donated to the Trust by the Royal Society of Arts, which had bought it from Sir John Lindsay Dashwood five years previously. Quarry Bank Mill in Cheshire was donated to the Trust in 1939 with an estate including the village of Styal, which had been built for the mill workers by Samuel Greg.

During the 1930s and 1940s, the Trust benefited from the unconventional fundraising tactics of Ferguson&#x27;s Gang; a group of women with pseudonyms such as Bill Stickers and Red Biddy who wore disguises and carried out stunts when delivering money to the Trust. Their donations enabled the Trust to purchase various properties including Shalford Mill, in Surrey, and Newtown Old Town Hall, on the Isle of Wight.

===The country house scheme===
Bailey was followed as chairman of the Trust by the 2nd Marquess of Zetland, and in 1936 the Trust set up the Country Houses Committee, with James Lees-Milne as secretary, to look into ways of preserving country houses and gardens at a time when their owners could no longer afford to maintain them. A country house scheme was set up and the National Trust Acts of 1937 and 1939 facilitated the transfer of estates from private owners to the Trust. The scheme allowed owners to escape estate duty on their country house and on the endowment which was necessary for the upkeep of the house, while they and their heirs could continue to live in the property, providing the public were allowed some access. The first house offered under the scheme was Stourhead in Wiltshire, although it was not acquired by the Trust until after the death in 1947 of the owners Sir Henry and Lady Hoare.
The first property to be actually handed over to the Trust under the scheme was a relatively modern house: Wightwick Manor near Wolverhampton had been built just fifty years earlier. Lacock Abbey, also in Wiltshire, was another early acquisition, handed to the Trust by Matilda Talbot (granddaughter of Henry Fox Talbot) after nearly seven years of negotiations. The house came with the village of Lacock and an endowment of .

===The postwar years===
After World War II the National Land Fund was set up by the government as a &quot;thank-offering for victory&quot; with the purpose of using money from the sale of surplus war stores to acquire property in the national interest. The scheme also allowed for the transfer to the Trust of historic houses and land left to the government in payment of estate duty. The first open space acquired by the Trust under the Land scheme was farmland at Hartsop in the Lake District; the first country house was Cotehele in Cornwall. Later acquisitions included Hardwick Hall, Ickworth House, Penrhyn Castle and Sissinghurst Castle Garden. The Land Fund was replaced in 1980 by the National Heritage Memorial Fund.

The work of the Trust was aided by further legislation during this period: the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 led to greater cooperation between local authorities and the Trust, while the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act 1953 allowed the Trust to receive government grants for the upkeep and maintenance of historic buildings on the same terms as other owners.

A major project, begun in 1959 and completed in 1964, was the restoration of the southern section of the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal. The Trust was persuaded to take on the scheme by John Smith and the work was carried out by hundreds of volunteers.

Between 1945 and 1965 the Trust, under the chairmanship of the Earl of Crawford, saw a growth in its membership from 7,850 to 157,581 and growth in its staff from 15 to 450. The area of land owned by the Trust increased from in 1945 to in 1965, with a further covenanted. In May 1945, the Trust&#x27;s London headquarters had moved to premises in Queen Anne&#x27;s Gate.

===The Benson Report===
In 1965 the Trust launched Enterprise Neptune, a campaign to raise funds to buy or acquire covenants over stretches of coastline and protect them from development. The project was successful, raising over £800,000 in its first year, but it had unforeseen consequences for the Trust as the project director, Conrad Rawnsley (a former naval commander and grandson of one of the Trusts&#x27; founders, Hardwicke Rawnsley), fell out with the administration of the Trust and conducted a public attack against it. An extraordinary general meeting was called in February 1967 and, although the reform group&#x27;s resolutions were defeated, the Trust recognised the need for change and set up an advisory committee to look at their management and organisation. The committee was chaired by accountant Sir Henry Benson, who was independent of the Trust. The other three members, Len Clark, Sir William Hayter, and Patrick Gibson, were all on the Trust&#x27;s council. The Benson report was published in 1968 and, although broadly endorsing the Trust&#x27;s policy, recommended a number of organisational changes, which were then embodied in the National Trust Act of 1971. Following the publication of the report, much of the administration of the Trust was devolved to the regions.

===Centenary===
The last three decades of the 20th century saw a large increase in membership of the Trust from 160,000 in 1968 to over two million by the time of its centenary in 1995, much of it down to the Trust&#x27;s employment of a director of public relations, as recommended by the Benson report, and regional information officers. Starting in the 1970s, tea rooms and souvenir shops were opened in Trust properties, and in 1984 a company was set up to operate the trading activities. Programmes of events, including plays and concerts, and educational activities were organised at Trust properties. In 1986 the Trust appointed its first female chairman, Dame Jennifer Jenkins.

When the Trust reached its centenary in 1995 it owned or looked after 223 houses, 159 gardens, of open countryside, and of coastline.

In the 1990s, there was a dispute within the Trust over stag hunting, which was the subject of much debate at annual general meetings. The Trust banned stag hunting on its land in 1997.

===21st century===
In 2002 the Trust bought its first country house in more than a decade. Tyntesfield, a Victorian Gothic mansion in Somerset, was acquired with donations from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the Heritage Lottery Fund as well as members of the public. Three years later, in 2005, the Trust acquired another country house, Seaton Delaval Hall in Northumberland.
In 2005, the Trust moved to Heelis, a new head office in Swindon, Wiltshire. The building was constructed on the site of the former Great Western Railway factory and is intended as a model of brownfield renewal. The name Heelis is taken from the married name of children&#x27;s author Beatrix Potter, a supporter of, and donor to, the Trust, which now owns the land she formerly owned in Cumbria. A refit of the premises to accommodate increasing staff numbers was announced in June 2019.
In 2007, the bicentenary of the official abolition of the slave trade, the Trust published the article &quot;Addressing the Past&quot; in its quarterly magazine, examining aspects of the Trust&#x27;s &quot;hidden history&quot; and finding ways of &quot;reinterpreting some of its properties and collections&quot;. Research carried out by the Trust revealed in 2020 that 93, nearly one third, of their houses and gardens had connections with colonialism and historic slavery: &#x27;this includes the global slave trades, goods and products of enslaved labour, abolition and protest, and the East India Company&#x27;. The report attracted controversy and the Charity Commission opened a regulatory compliance case into the Trust in September 2020 to examine the trustees&#x27; decision-making. The Charity Commission concluded that there were no grounds for regulatory action against the Trust. In 2020 the Dunham Massey Hall sundial statue of &quot;a kneeling African figure clad in leaves carrying the sundial above his head&quot; was removed from its position in front of Dunham Massey Hall after calls were made for the removal of statues in Britain with links to the slave trade in the wake of the murder of George Floyd.

Between 2008 and 2013, the National Trust in Devon was defrauded of over £1 million by one of its employees. Building surveyor Roger Bryant was convicted in September 2024 of having submitted false invoices to the Trust and was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison. The fraud had only come to light when the Trust decided to update its procurement procedures in 2013.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to the closure in March 2020 of National Trust houses, shops, and cafes, closely followed by all gated parks and gardens. At the same time, the Trust launched the #BlossomWatch campaign which encouraged people to share images on social media of blossoms seen on lockdown walks. Parks and gardens started to re-open from June 2020. 

In 2021, a group of members started a campaign, Restore Trust, to debate concerns about the future of the charity. At the Trust&#x27;s 2023 annual general meeting the Restore Trust Group put up three candidates for the council and two resolutions, but all were rejected by the membership.

==Governance==



The trust is an independent charity (no. 205846). It was founded as a not-for-profit company in 1895, but was later re-incorporated by a local act of Parliament, the &#x27; (7 Edw. 7. c. cxxxvi). Subsequent acts of Parliament between 1919 and 1971 amended and extended the trust&#x27;s powers and remit. The governance of the trust was amended by the &#x27; (SI 2005/712).

The trust is governed by a board of trustees (of between nine and fifteen members), appointed and overseen by a council consisting of eighteen people elected by the members of the trust and eighteen appointed by other organisations whose work is related to that of the Trust, such as the Soil Association, the Royal Horticultural Society and the Council for British Archaeology. The members periodically vote on the organisations which may appoint half of the council. Members may also propose and vote on motions at the annual general meeting.

At an operational level, the trust is organised into regions which are aligned with the official local government regions of the UK. Its headquarters are in Swindon.

In 2019/20 the trust was employing 14,000 staff, including about 4,000 seasonal workers. Since 2009, customer services have been outsourced to Capita. The director-general of the Trust, Hilary McGrady, is paid an annual salary of £195,700, with a further eight executives being paid over £100,000 a year. The Trust is not a real living wage employer. In July 2020 the Trust announced that 1,200 jobs were at risk due to the coronavirus pandemic. In October 2020 the Trust announced 1,300 job losses.

==Funding==
For the year ended February 2020, the total income of the Trust was £680.95 million. The largest sources of income were membership subscriptions (£269.7 million), direct property income (£196.9 million), enterprise and renewable energy income (£79.3 million), and legacies (£61.6 million). The Trust also received £20.8 million in grants, including £5.6 million from Natural England, £4.3 million from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, and £3.5 million from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. In recognition of National Lottery funding, the Trust invited lottery ticket holders to visit over 100 properties free of charge for a few days in November 2017, 2018, and 2019.&lt;ref name=&quot;Annual Report 2019/20&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust also takes part in the annual Heritage Open Days programme, when non-members can visit selected properties free of charge.

==Membership and volunteering==
In the year ending February 2020, the Trust had 5.95 million members (2.78 million memberships). Members are entitled to free entry to trust properties that are open to the public for a charge. There is a separate organisation called the Royal Oak Foundation for American supporters.

The trust is supported by volunteers, who, as of 2020, numbered over 53,000.

==National Trust properties==
As of 2020, the Trust owns almost of land, of coast, more than 200 historic houses, 41 castles and chapels, 47 industrial monuments and mills, the sites of factories and mines, 9 lighthouses, 56 villages, 39 public houses, and 25 medieval barns. Most of the land is farmed, either in-hand or by tenant farmers. The Trust also rents out holiday cottages, which are given a rating of 1–5 Acorns to reflect the quality of the property.

===Historic houses and gardens===
The Trust owns more than 200 historic houses that are open to the public. Most of them are large country houses or stately homes set in gardens and parks. They contain collections of pictures, furniture, books, metalwork, ceramics, and textiles that have remained in their historic context. Service wings are preserved at many houses. Attingham Park in Shropshire, the most visited National Trust country house in 2019/20, is set in typical grounds with a walled garden and extensive parkland planted with trees to the designs of Humphry Repton. The most visited National Trust property in England in 2019/20 for which an admission charge is made was Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire, a park without a country house. Clumber House was largely demolished in 1938, leaving a 19th-century chapel as the focus of the park, which also contains a lake with wooded islands, a stable block, glasshouses, and two classical temples.

The first country house to be acquired by the Trust, the Elizabethan manor house Barrington Court in Somerset, was bought in 1907 and came in a dilapidated state and devoid of contents. The experience taught the Trust a salutary lesson about the need for endowments to cover the costs of the upkeep of country houses. The Trust acquired the majority of its country houses in the mid 20th century, when death duties were at their highest and many country houses were being demolished. The arrangements made with families bequeathing their homes to the Trust often allowed them to continue to live in the property. Since the 1980s, the Trust has been increasingly reluctant to take over large houses without substantial accompanying endowment funds, and its acquisitions in this category have been less frequent, with only two, Tyntesfield and Seaton Delaval Hall, since 2000.

As well as great country houses, the Trust also owns smaller properties, many of them associated with famous people. Examples include: Cherryburn, the cottage in Northumberland where Thomas Bewick was born; Smallhythe Place in Kent, home to Ellen Terry; Shaw&#x27;s Corner in Hertfordshire, the country home of George Bernard Shaw. The home of architect Ernő Goldfinger, 2 Willow Road in Hampstead, London, was the first example of Modernist architecture to be acquired by the Trust. In 1995 the Trust bought 20 Forthlin Road in Liverpool, the childhood home of Paul McCartney; 251 Menlove Avenue, the childhood home of John Lennon, was bought by Yoko Ono in 2002 and donated to the Trust. The Birmingham Back to Backs are an example of working-class housing preserved by the Trust.

Some properties have individual arrangements with the Trust, so for example Wakehurst Place is managed by the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew and Waddesdon Manor by a private foundation; both are open to the public. In January 2025, it was announced that the Trust had entered into an agreement with Historic Coventry Trust to run the The Charterhouse, Coventry.

===Art collection===

Since its founding in 1895, the trust has gradually expanded its collection of art, mostly through whole property acquisitions. From 1956 until the post was removed in 2021, there was a curator of pictures and sculpture. The first was St John (Bobby) Gore, who was appointed &quot;Adviser on Paintings&quot; in 1956. He published catalogues of the pictures at Upton House, Polesden Lacey, Buscot Park, Saltram House, and Ascott House. His successor in 1986 was Alastair Laing, who cared for the works of art at 120 properties and created the exhibition &quot;In Trust for the Nation&quot;, held at the National Gallery in 1995–96. From 2009 until 2021, the curator was David Taylor, who approved photographs of the Trust&#x27;s 12,567 oil paintings to be included in the Public Catalogue Foundation&#x27;s searchable online archive of oil paintings, available since 2012. Artists represented in the Trust&#x27;s collections include Rembrandt (whose &quot;Self-portrait wearing a white feathered bonnet&quot; which is now displayed at Buckland Abbey was recently re-attributed to the artist), Hieronymous Bosch, El Greco, Peter Paul Rubens, Angelica Kauffmann, and Stanley Spencer.

From the 1980s to 2001 the Trust commissioned artists to create works depicting National Trust places with their &quot;Foundation for Art&quot;, and in 2009 launched its contemporary art programme entitled &quot;Trust New Art&quot; in a joint venture with Arts Council England and Arts Council of Wales. As part of this programme, the Trust has worked with over 200 artists to create new artworks inspired by their places including: Jeremy Deller, Anya Gallaccio, Antony Gormley, Sir Richard Long, Serena Korda, Marcus Coates and Katie Paterson.

===Coastline and countryside===

The National Trust is the largest private landowner in the United Kingdom. The Trust&#x27;s land holdings account for almost , mostly of countryside. A large part of this consists of parks and agricultural estates attached to country houses, but there are many countryside properties which were acquired specifically for their scenic or scientific value. The Trust owns or has covenant over about a quarter of the Lake District; it has similar control over about 12% of the Peak District National Park (e.g. South Peak Estate and High Peak Estate).

Most National Trust land, about , consists of tenant or in-hand farms, where public access is restricted to rights of way and sometimes additional routes. At Wimpole Estate in Cambridgeshire, the home farm is open to the public. The Trust also owns forests, woods, downs, and moorland. These areas are generally open to the public free of charge, as are some of the parks attached to country houses (others have an admission charge).

The Trust owns or protects roughly one-fifth of the coastline in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (), and has a long-term campaign, Project Neptune, which seeks to acquire more.

===Protection of National Trust property===
The National Trust Acts grant the Trust the unique statutory power to declare land inalienable. This prevents the land from being sold or mortgaged against the Trust&#x27;s wishes without special parliamentary procedure. The inalienability of trust land was over-ridden by Parliament in the case of proposals to construct a section of the Plympton bypass through the park at Saltram, on the grounds that the road proposal had been known about before the park at Saltram was declared inalienable.

In 2017 the Trust, in spite of criticism by members, supported the government&#x27;s scheme to build a road tunnel under the Stonehenge World Heritage Site as part of the plans to upgrade the A303 road. The scheme would involve the compulsory purchase of land held inalienably by the Trust.

===Most visited properties===

The Trust&#x27;s 2022–2023 Annual Reports lists all properties open at charge with more than 50,000 visitors. The top ten are:

<text>The National Trust for Scotland () is a Scottish conservation organisation. It is the largest membership organisation in Scotland and describes itself as &quot;the charity that cares for, shares and speaks up for Scotland’s magnificent heritage&quot;.

The Trust owns and manages around 130 properties and of land, including castles, ancient small dwellings, historic sites, gardens, coastline, mountains and countryside. It is similar in function to the National Trust, which covers England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and to other national trusts worldwide.

==History==
The Trust was established in 1931 as the &quot;National Trust for Scotland for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty&quot;, following discussions held in the smoking room of Pollok House (now a Trust property). The Trust was incorporated on 1 May 1931, with John Stewart-Murray, 8th Duke of Atholl being elected as its first president, Sir Iain Colqhoun serving as the first chairman. Sir John Stirling Maxwell, owner of Pollok House, was appointed as a vice-president, and provided the trust with its first property, Crookston Castle. Another early acquisition was Glen Coe, which was purchased with assistance from the Scottish Mountaineering Club in 1935.

In 1935, following the passage of the National Trust for Scotland Order Confirmation Act 1935, the Trust gained the power to declare its properties &quot;inalienable&quot;, meaning that they are effectively held &quot;in perpetuity&quot;, and can only be removed from the Trust with parliamentary permission. 

When the Trust took on the management of mountain estates there was controversy concerning issues such as the siting of visitor centres, which some considered inappropriate for land of &quot;wild&quot; character. The Trust has since removed some intrusive facilities, with the original Glen Coe Visitor Centre being removed in 2002; a new centre was built lower down the glen. Similarly the visitor centre at Ben Lawers was removed in 2012.

In August 2010, a report called &quot;Fit For Purpose&quot; by George Reid, commissioned by the Trust, cited shortcomings that were corrected though organizational restructuring largely completed by the end of its 2011/12 Fiscal Year. The stabilisation of the Trust&#x27;s finances allowed it to make its first acquisition in seven years when it bought the Alloa Tower in Clackmannanshire in 2015.

Historians working for the NTS have estimated that at least 36 of the 139 historic properties owned by the Trust have links to the Atlantic slave trade. Many former of owners of NTS properties either directly or indirectly benefited from the ownership or exploitation of enslaved people, or received compensation payments from the Slave Compensation Act 1837.

==Organisation==
The Trust is a registered charity under Scottish law. it employed 1,144 people in total (taking account of seasonal employees), up from 760 in 2022. This equated to 617 people on a full-time equivalent basis, up from 469 in 2022. The Trust&#x27;s Patron is King Charles III; the President is Jackie Bird; the CEO is Philip Long OBE; and the chairman is Sir Mark Jones. 

==Funding==
For the year ending 28 February 2022, the Trust&#x27;s total income was £51.9 million, up from £44.3 million in 2020–21. The largest sources of income were membership subscriptions (£14.7 million), commercial activities (£9.0 million), investment income (£5.3 million), and property income (£5.3 million). In the same year the Trust&#x27;s total expenditure was £51.9 million, up from £44.1 million in 2020–21. The Trust therefore recorded an operating operational deficit of £11.3 million, however this was less bad than anticipated and largely attributed to the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. A three-year Business Recovery Plan was put in place to restore financial sustainability and ensure the trust was able to undertake repairs and maintenance delayed by the pandemic, and to continue to invest in conservation and visitor engagement activities at its properties.

For the year ended 29 February 2024, the Trust&#x27;s total income was £69.5 million; in the same year the Trust&#x27;s total expenditure was £75.9 million. The Trust therefore recorded an annual operating deficit of £6.4 million, however this loss was offset with investment growth of £7.9 million during the year, meaning the trust recorded a small increase in overall balance carried forward to the following year.

==Membership==
Annual membership of the Trust allows free entry to properties and &quot;Discovery Tickets&quot; are available for shorter term visitors. Membership also provides free entry to National Trust properties in England and Wales and Northern Ireland, and many otherother national trusts worldwide; members of these organisations enjoy a reciprocal right of free entry to NTS properties. The Trust has independent sister organisations in the United States (The National Trust for Scotland Foundation USA), and Canada (The Canadian National Trust for Scotland Foundation). The organisation&#x27;s membership magazine was &quot;Heritage Scotland&quot; until 2002 when it was re-named &quot;Scotland in Trust&quot;.

For the maintenance of its nature properties, the Trust depends on the contributions of volunteers, with local circles of Conservation Volunteers working on projects during weekends. The charity also formerly organised working holidays called &quot;Thistle Camps&quot; on various properties, with activities undertaken including footpath maintenance and woodland work such as rhododendron control. However as of 2025 Thistle Camps are currently not on offer, with the programme having original been suspended in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==National Trust for Scotland properties==

===Historic houses===
The Trust owns 27 historic houses, ranging from large houses such as Culzean Castle and the House of Dun to humbler dwellings such as the Tenement House and Moirlanich Longhouse.

===Gardens===
The Trust is Scotland&#x27;s largest garden owner with just under 70 gardens that cover 238 hectares and contain 13,500 varieties of plant. These gardens include 35 &quot;major gardens&quot; with the remainder forming part of other properties. The gardens represent the full history of Scottish gardening ranging from the medieval, to the renaissance at Culross Palace, through the 18th-century picturesque at Culzean Castle and Victorian formality at the House of Dun to 20th-century plant collections at Brodick and Inverewe.

===Coastline and countryside===

The Trust is the third largest land manager in Scotland, owning 76,000 hectares of Scottish countryside including 46 Munros, 8 national nature reserves, more than 400 islands and islets, and significant stretches of coastline. Trust countryside properties include Glen Coe, Torridon and Mar Lodge Estate.
The Trust&#x27;s management of its coastal and countryside sites is guided by its &quot;Wild Land Policy&quot; which aims to preserve the land in its undeveloped state and provide access and enjoyment to the public. Trust sites are home to a diverse variety of native wildlife. The Trust estimate that almost 25% of Scotland&#x27;s seabirds nest on its island and coastal sites, equivalent to 8% of seabirds in Europe. The Trust&#x27;s countryside properties are home to native mammal species including red deer, pine marten, wildcat and red squirrel.

Since 1957, the Trust have owned and managed the archipelago of St Kilda, Scotland&#x27;s first World Heritage Site and the only World Heritage Site in the UK to be listed for both its natural and cultural significance. St Kilda and the surrounding sea stacks are home to over one million seabirds as well as three species unique to the islands; the Soay sheep; St Kilda field mouse and St Kilda wren.

===Paintings and sculpture collection===
Across its properties the Trust is responsible for the conservation and display of hundreds of thousands of objects from paintings to furniture and domestic tools. The primary aim of the Trust&#x27;s curatorship is to present collections and works of art in the historic settings for which they were commissioned or acquired.

===Most visited sites===
During the 2023-24 financial year the Trust received in 4.5 million visitors in total, including an estimated 1.8 million visitors recorded at free-to-enter countryside properties: the Trust considers this figure to be below the actual number due to practical challenges of recording open access across a large countryside estate. In the year 2021–21 the Trust welcomed a total of 2.2 million visitors to its properties, of which 1.3 million were visits to &quot;gated&quot; properties (properties which non-members are required to pay for entry). In 2016 the 10 most visited properties were:

<text>The National Trust for Historic Preservation is a privately funded, nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., that works in the field of historic preservation in the United States. The member-supported organization was founded in 1949 by congressional charter to support the preservation of America’s diverse historic buildings, neighborhoods, and heritage through its programs, resources, and advocacy.

==Overview==

The National Trust for Historic Preservation aims to empower local preservationists by providing leadership to save and revitalize America&#x27;s historic places, and by working on both national policies as well as local preservation campaigns through its network of field offices and preservation partners, including the National Park Service, State Historic Preservation Offices, and local preservation groups.

The National Trust is headquartered in Washington, D.C., with field operations located throughout the country. The organization is governed by a board of trustees and led by president &amp; CEO, Carol Quillen. As of November 2023, the National Trust reports that it has over 1 million actively engaged visitors, followers, supporters, and advocates.

In addition to leading campaigns and advocacy, the National Trust provides a growing educational resource through the Preservation Leadership Forum, which offers articles, journals, case studies, and conferences and training. The National Trust issues the quarterly &quot;Preservation&quot; magazine as well as online stories.

The National Trust’s current work focuses on building sustainable communities through the adaptive reuse of historic spaces; preserving and empowering cultural diversity through protecting sites of cultural significance; advocating for greater stewardship of historic places on public land; and leading innovation in the management of historic properties.

==History==

Toward the end of the 19th century, in response to increased immigration and the broad effort of rebuilding after the Civil War, the country was developing a renewed sense of national identity and history. The government began to enact legislation for the preservation of sites and objects deemed significant to the nation’s history. In 1872, an Act of Congress established the first National Park, Yellowstone. In 1906, the Antiquities Act enabled the President to declare landmarks or objects as a national monument. Then in 1935, during the Great Depression, Congress passed the Historic Sites Act, which outlined programs for research and inventory of historic sites.

Meanwhile, historic preservation initiatives existed on local and state levels. In 1931, Charleston, South Carolina created the first historic district for protection. However, efforts to save and maintain historic sites were still largely limited to private citizens or local groups.

In the late 1940s, leaders in American historic preservation saw the need for a national organization to support local preservation efforts. In 1946, David E. Finley Jr., George McAneny, Christopher Crittenden, and Ronald Lee met at the National Gallery of Art to discuss the formation of such a national organization. This meeting was followed by a larger gathering on April 15, 1947, attended by representatives from a number of art, architectural, and historical societies, which culminated in the creation of the National Council for Historic Sites and Buildings. The meeting’s attendants became the first charter members of the council. The organization’s first headquarters was in the offices of Ford’s Theatre (Lincoln Museum) in downtown Washington, D.C.

The Council pursued the formation of a National Trust for Historic Preservation, somewhat modeled on the British National Trust, which would be tasked with the acquisition and maintenance of historic properties. The creation of the National Trust was proposed as a bill to Congress, H.R. 5170, introduced by Congressman J. Hardin Peterson of Florida and passed.

The private, nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation was formally established by charter through the Act of Congress when President Harry S. Truman signed the legislation on October 26, 1949. The charter provided that the Trust should acquire and preserve historic sites and objects of national significance and provide annual reports to Congress on its activities. Finley served as the National Trust&#x27;s first chairman of the board, remaining in the position for 12 years. Archaeologist Richard Hubbard Howland became the nonprofit&#x27;s first president in 1956.

 The National Trust and the National Council existed side by side for several years until the need to merge resources compelled the executive committee to integrate the two entities. In 1952, the boards of both organizations approved a merger of the Council into the National Trust. The merger was effective the following year and was completed by 1956. The National Trust became a membership organization and assumed all other functions of the National Council.

In its early years, the National Trust’s founders envisioned an organization whose primary purpose would be the acquisition and administration of historic sites, while encouraging public participation in their preservation. In 1957, the National Trust officially acquired its first property, Woodlawn Plantation in northern Virginia. Since then, the National Trust portfolio of historic properties and contracted affiliates has expanded to include twenty-seven historic sites, ranging from the 18th-century Drayton Hall in South Carolina to the Modernist Glass House in Connecticut.

Over the next decade, the National Trust grew to become the leading national organization in historic preservation. They began working with citizens and city planning officials on legislative matters, including federal, state, and municipal ordinances for historic preservation. National Trust staff also traveled to parts of the country to advise local communities on preservation projects.

In 1966, Congress passed the National Historic Preservation Act, significant legislation for the preservation movement. The Act also provided federal funding in support of the National Trust’s work. The funding later ceased in 1996, at which point the National Trust became entirely privately funded.

Following the adoption of the National Historic Preservation Act, the National Trust broadened in its mission beyond administering historic sites. In 1969, the National Trust created the Preservation Services Fund to provide financial assistance to local preservation projects. In 1971, the National Trust opened its first field office in San Francisco. As the organization grew, the National Trust expanded its work, consisting of programs, educational resources, and advocacy. In 1980, the National Trust initiated the National Main Street Center, specializing in revitalizing historic business districts, which has since transitioned into a subsidiary.

In 2010, Stephanie Meeks became the organization’s president, replacing Richard Moe, who had led the organization for 17 years. 

In 2013, the National Trust headquarters moved from the Andrew Mellon Building on 1785 Massachusetts Avenue, NW in Washington D.C.’s Dupont Circle to the historic Watergate office complex. Meeks said in a statement about the move, &quot;The selection of the Watergate demonstrates our ongoing commitment to recognizing and protecting important places from every era in American history, including the recent past.&quot; In 2022, the National Trust headquarters moved from the Watergate to a shared coworking space (located in a former Garfinckel&#x27;s department store) in downtown D.C.

The National Trust’s programs include publication of the annual list of America&#x27;s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places, first issued in 1988, which highlights endangered sites across the country.

Meeks stepped down as president in December 2018. Former general counsel and chief legal officer Paul Edmondson then served as president and CEO until the spring of 2023. 

Beginning in January of 2024, Carol Quillen, former president of Davidson College, began serving as president and CEO.
==Programs==


=== America&#x27;s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places List ===

First published in 1988, the National Trust’s list of America&#x27;s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places is an annual list that highlights endangered historic sites across the United States. The list serves to raise national awareness of these sites. The sites are nominated by the public and eventually selected based on a range of factors, including its significance, whether there is a local group engaged in its preservation, the urgency of the threat, and potential solutions to that threat.

=== African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund ===
In 2017, the Trust launched an initiative called the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund to identify underrepresented Black cultural sites in need of funding for restoration and preservation. The program has been directed by historian Brent Leggs.

===Preservation Leadership Forum and resources===
The National Trust for Historic Preservation organizes the Preservation Leadership Forum, a network of preservation professionals.

=== Historic Hotels of America ===
The National Trust for Historic Preservation created Historic Hotels of America in 1989, with 32 charter members. Historic Hotels of America identifies hotels that have maintained their authenticity, sense of place, and architectural integrity. As of June 5, 2015, the program includes over 260 members in 44 states, including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

To be included in the program, hotels must be at least 50 years old; designated by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior as a National Historic Landmark or listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places; and recognized as having historic significance.

===National Treasures===
Initiated in 2011, the National Treasures program identified historically significant landmarks that face imminent threat. With the support of local preservationists, the National Trust led direct action to save these sites through fundraising, coalition building, and legal advocacy. The sites were selected based on criteria including: integrity, contribution to America’s diverse history, and preservation strategies that can be applied to other sites.

The portfolio of National Treasures included, for example:
*Fort Monroe in Hampton, Virginia
*Historic Wintersburg in Huntington Beach, California
* Houston Astrodome in Houston, Texas
*Miami Marine Stadium in Miami, Florida
*The historic Rosenwald Schools built in the early 19th century to educate African-American children.
*South Side Community Art Center

== Advocacy ==
The National Trust’s advocacy arm works to effect policy at the local, state, and federal level. Current advocacy priorities are:

=== Historic Tax Credit (HTC) ===
The Historic Tax Credit (HTC) is the federal tax credit program that incentivizes the rehabilitation of historic buildings. The HTC, which has rehabilitated more than 38,700 buildings and leveraged about $106 billion in private investment nationwide, is in danger of being eliminated in current budget-balancing discussions in Congress.

=== Federal transportation legislation ===
The federal Department of Transportation Act of 1966 included Section 4(f), which stipulates that planners must develop projects that protect or avoid historic resources. However, Section 4(f) is periodically challenged through the transportation reauthorization process, most recently during the consideration of MAP-21. Due to work by preservationists, Section 4(f) remains intact.

=== Public lands ===
The National Trust advocates for the preservation of historic and cultural resources on federal public lands, partnering with the Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service, and the National Park Service. The National Trust supported the Green Mountain Lookout Heritage Protection Act, a bill that would prevent the United States Forest Service from removing a building from the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area in Washington State unless the agency determines that the structure is unsafe for visitors. The National Trust stating that it was &quot;pleased that Congress has acted to protect this historically significant and locally cherished landmark. With this vote, the House joins the Senate in affirming that the preservation of this historic resource is compatible with wilderness protection.&quot;

<doc id="99110" wikidata="Q719661" url="?curid=99110" title="Jack O'Neill">
<text>Jonathan J. &quot;Jack&quot; O&#x27;Neill is a fictional character in the MGM&#x27;s military science fiction franchise &quot;Stargate&quot;, primarily as one of the main characters of the television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. Richard Dean Anderson played O&#x27;Neill in all the &quot;Stargate&quot; media since 1997, when he took over the role from actor Kurt Russell, who portrayed the character in the original &quot;Stargate&quot; film in 1994. O&#x27;Neill and Daniel Jackson are the only two characters to appear in both the original film and all three live-action &quot;Stargate&quot; television series.

In his first appearance in the 1994 film as Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neill, the character leads the first team to go through the Stargate on a reconnaissance mission. He subsequently becomes the main character of the television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; created in 1997 as a sequel to the movie. In the first seven seasons of the show, Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neill, recalled from retirement after the first film, is the leader of the team SG-1, a part of the Stargate Program, whose goal is to explore the galaxy and defend against alien threats.

He became less prominent in the eighth season, in which he is promoted to Commanding Officer of Stargate Command, at the rank of brigadier general, therefore greatly reducing the character&#x27;s time spent exploring via the Stargate. Anderson chose to spend more time with his family, eventually leaving the show at the start of its ninth season and only appearing four times until the end of the series in its tenth and final season. The character&#x27;s absence from the show was explained by yet another promotion, to the position of head of the Department of Homeworld Security, as a major general.

Anderson reprised his role once again in the direct-to-DVD film &quot;&quot;, a sequel to the TV series. O&#x27;Neill also appeared in the two other &quot;Stargate&quot; television series: he was an occasional character in the first three seasons of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, serving as an Earth contact with Atlantis, this running parallel with Stargate SG-1 for a time, and in four episodes of &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;, as a lieutenant general, having been promoted sometime after both &quot;SG-1&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; had ended. His appearance in this show&#x27;s first season finale is his last appearance in the &quot;Stargate&quot; universe to date. Anderson also voiced the character in the video game &quot;Stargate SG-1: Unleashed&quot;.

==Character arc==
Jack O&#x27;Neill is a United States Air Force colonel with experience in special operations before joining the Stargate Program. He was married to Sara O&#x27;Neill, but their marriage suffered when Jack sank into a deep depression after their son accidentally shot himself with O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s pistol. He then joins a dangerous mission through the Stargate with a couple of airmen and Dr. Daniel Jackson, who deciphers how to use the Stargate. They are transported to another planet. O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s standing order is to detonate a nuclear warhead near the Stargate at any sign of danger. But a young boy named Skaara gives him a renewed sense of life. After the defeat of Ra, O&#x27;Neill and his team return to Earth, while Jackson remains on the planet. Though he and Sara were still together when Jack was initially recruited for his first mission through the Stargate, by the time he returned she had left him.

O&#x27;Neill returns to the Stargate Program when the Goa&#x27;uld Apophis attacks the Earth installation via its stargate. He is given command of the SG-1 team, which consists of himself, Samantha Carter, Teal&#x27;c and Jackson. Eventually O&#x27;Neill gets the Repository of the Ancients temporarily &quot;downloaded&quot; to his brain and becomes the first modern human to travel to another galaxy, the Asgard home galaxy. A second download of the Ancients&#x27; knowledge into his brain during the season 7 finale, allows him to lead SG-1 to an Ancient outpost in Antarctica. O&#x27;Neill possesses the ATA gene, and thus is able to operate the Ancient weapons chair and save Earth from Anubis&#x27;s fleet. With the Ancient knowledge about to overwhelm his personality and kill him, he is placed into a stasis pod in the outpost until Thor of the Asgard is able to remove the knowledge and save his life. After that event, O&#x27;Neill is promoted to brigadier general and is given command of Stargate Command. O&#x27;Neill is promoted again off-screen and becomes the new head of the Office of Homeworld Security/Homeworld Command after the retirement of General Hammond, with Major General Hank Landry taking his position as the new commander of Stargate Command.

In the pilot of Stargate Atlantis, O&#x27;Neill convinces John Sheppard to join the Atlantis expedition to the Pegasus Galaxy. In 2006, he, along with Richard Woolsey, visits Atlantis to create a treaty between the humans of Earth and the Ancients. The death of O&#x27;Neill is briefly shown in an alternate timeline where Ba&#x27;al controls the Goa&#x27;uld Empire. O&#x27;Neill reappears as a lieutenant general in &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; with Nicholas Rush, where he is recruiting Eli Wallace into the Icarus Project. After the attack on the Icarus Base, he contacts Carter from The Pentagon to talk about the ongoing situation. With help from the Ancient Communication Stones, Everett Young body swaps with Colonel David Telford to tell O&#x27;Neill about a dire situation in which they find themselves.

==Conceptual history==
===Conception===

John Symes approached Michael Greenburg and Richard Dean Anderson of &quot;MacGyver&quot; fame. Although Anderson was never a real fan of the science fiction genre, he believed the original feature film to be a good vehicle for a series. Anderson agreed to become involved with the project if his character was allowed significantly more comedic leeway than Kurt Russell&#x27;s character in the feature film, shown especially Anderson&#x27;s flippant and utter disregard for appropriate military protocol and decorum over the series, which contrasted Russell&#x27;s &quot;by the book&quot; adherence to protocol. He also requested &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; to be more of an ensemble show, so that he would not be carrying the plot alone as on &quot;MacGyver&quot;. Anderson was part of the main cast from season 1 through 8 and played a recurring role in several episodes each season thereafter. He was influential in the development of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s character and personality from the beginning. While he praised the work done by Russell in the &quot;Stargate&quot; film, he said he couldn&#x27;t be that serious all the time and worked with the writers and directors to give his O&#x27;Neill a more lighthearted tone while maintaining the sense of importance the role required. Additionally, he joked that he would never be able to get his hair to stay like Russell&#x27;s. This &quot;double personality&quot; was also joked in the second season, when Jack introduced himself as: &quot;It&#x27;s &#x27;O&#x27;Neill,&#x27; with two &#x27;L&#x27;s. There&#x27;s another Colonel O&#x27;Neil with only one L, and he has no sense of humor at all.&quot; Fans have speculated that the transition is due to Russell&#x27;s O&#x27;Neill still being deeply traumatised by the recent death of his son, while Anderson&#x27;s has overcome the worst of his issues even if he makes it clear he will never forget his loss.

===Development===
In season 8, Anderson chose to have a reduced role in the series so that he could spend more time with his young daughter. When Anderson left the show as a main character in the eighth season, the producers were talking about ending the series. Instead, the series introduced two new characters in the ninth season, Ben Browder as Cameron Mitchell, the new SG-1 team leader, and Beau Bridges as Hank Landry, the new commanding officer of Stargate Command. Anderson continued to appear in a recurring status on &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, albeit with less frequent appearances. He returned for the second straight-to-DVD film, &quot;&quot; in a brief cameo, and was expected to return for the third movie. Executive producer Brad Wright stressed the importance of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s presence in the Stargate universe even after the character went on hiatus during the last two seasons of SG-1 when Anderson took a leave from regular acting.

Anderson has also had various guest appearances on the two spin off series&#x27; &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;. Anderson had several guest cameos scattered over the first season of &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;. He is mainly seen in the Pentagon but later visits the Destiny after the revelations about Telford emerge. In total, he appears in six episodes of &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;, the most of any main actor from &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;.

==Reception==

For his portrayal of O&#x27;Neill, Richard Dean Anderson won a Saturn Award in the category &quot;Best Genre TV Actor&quot; in 1999, and was nominated in the same category in 1998 and 2000. From 2001 to 2005, Anderson was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category &quot;Best Actor on Television&quot; but never won. Anderson was nominated in the category for &quot;Best Male Performance in a 2008 Science Fiction Film, TV Movie, or Mini-Series&quot; at the Constellation Awards in 2009 for his work in &quot;&quot; (2008), where he reprised his role as O&#x27;Neill.

He was presented with an award at the Air Force Association&#x27;s 57th Annual Air Force Anniversary Dinner in Washington, D.C., on September 14, 2004, because of his role as star and executive producer of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, a series which has portrayed the Air Force in a positive light since it first premiered. It was presented by the then-Air Force Chief-of-Staff, General John P. Jumper. Anderson was made an honorary brigadier general.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked Jack O&#x27;Neill #10 on its &quot;25 Greatest Sci-Fi Legends of All Time&quot; list.

<text>Veronica Cecilia Lodge is one of the main characters in the Archie Comics franchise, and is the keyboardist and one of the three vocalists of rock band The Archies.

She is from New York but currently resides in the town of Riverdale, with her parents Hiram Lodge and Hermione Lodge. She is portrayed by Camila Mendes in &quot;Riverdale&quot; and Suhana Khan in &quot;The Archies&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
Veronica Lodge is the only child of Hiram Lodge, the richest man in Riverdale, and his wife Hermione Lodge. She is called both by her name &quot;Veronica&quot; and her nicknames &quot;Ronnie&quot; and &quot;Ron&quot;. Bob Montana knew the real-life Lodge family, because he had once painted a mural for them. Montana combined that name with actress Veronica Lake to create the character of Veronica Lodge. Her character was added in Pep Comics 38, just months after Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper, and Jughead Jones debuted, and just a few months before Reggie Mantle debuted.

Veronica is a beautiful young woman with raven hair, favoring expensive, up-to-the-minute fashion. In some comics, Mr. Lodge claimed that he moved his family to Riverdale in order to avoid Veronica becoming spoiled, like many of the children he knew and grew up with. His plan did not succeed as well as he had hoped, as Veronica is often depicted on spending sprees, in which she maxes out her credit cards. In one story she buys out every shoe store in Riverdale to prevent any other girl from buying a pair of shoes that she herself wanted. (Ironically, Veronica is often depicted going barefoot, both at home and away.) At times, Veronica&#x27;s vain and conceited attitude infuriates her father to the point that he has to somehow &quot;teach her a lesson&quot; and Veronica is forced to get a job of some kind or loses access to Archie.

In the earliest Archie Comics, there were a few different &#x27;Veronica origin&#x27; stories. In her debut story, in Pep #26, April 1942, Veronica was referred to as a &#x27;sub-debutante&#x27;, daughter of &#x27;Money Bags&#x27; Lodge of Beacon Hill, who had just come to live in Riverdale.
In Pep #31, September 1942, Veronica was revealed to have lived in Boston before coming to Riverdale. Her father Burton K. Lodge was introduced as a &#x27;big shot Boston politician&#x27;.

In &quot;Archie Comics&quot; #1 (Winter 1942), another version of Veronica&#x27;s emigration to Riverdale is depicted. In this story, Veronica was referred to as &#x27;the elusive sub-deb&#x27; and &#x27;that girl from New York&#x27;. Archie had never met this &#x27;society dame&#x27;, but kept daydreaming about her, and wrote letters to her he never sent. Archie wrote to her asking her to a dance in Riverdale, and the letter got sent accidentally; he really wanted to ask Betty Cooper, and was only daydreaming. Even after he realized he had sent the letter, he did not think she would really come. Veronica accepted the invitation, thinking that a dance would be fun. At the time she apparently lived in New York with her mother, and she begged Mrs. Lodge to let her go to the Riverdale dance. Archie struggled trying to keep his dates with both girls, thus beginning their love triangle.

Veronica was ranked 87th in the &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&#x27;s&quot; &quot;100 Sexiest Women in Comics&quot; list created by Brent Frankenhoff.

==Lifestyle and relationships==
Veronica enjoys a very posh lifestyle, as her family are among the richest people in the world. She nevertheless chooses to hang out with her less affluent friends, including the boy she is in love with, Archie Andrews, whom she nicknames &quot;Archiekins.&quot; Her level of interest in him varies, however. Mr. Lodge often has nightmares that Veronica and Archie will marry. In 2009, Archie Comics published the Archie Marries Veronica to explore this possible future, marrying Veronica to Archie in one universe and to Reggie in another.

Veronica&#x27;s best friend (and sometimes arch-rival) is Betty Cooper, and the two enjoy countless activities and interests. However, they are also at constant competition for Archie&#x27;s affections. Veronica is often jealous of Betty, and will go to any length to steal anything that is important or a triumph for Betty, even if she (Veronica) did not want it in the first place. If Betty has a date with a new boy, Veronica will let her have Archie for a brief time, so that she can steal the date. If Betty is praised for some achievement, Veronica will do anything to ruin it for her. In one story, she gave Betty a candy bar containing nuts (to which Betty is allergic), so that Veronica could steal her modeling job. Veronica is often seen scheming to get Archie from Betty whenever she spots the two dating. Occasionally, she is victorious. But usually, Betty manages to successfully take revenge on her. Also, Archie occasionally has stood up to Veronica and stuck with Betty.

Her other friends include Ethel Muggs, Midge Klump and Nancy Woods, and they all enjoy having slumber parties and shopping at the mall together. 

Periodically, she can be cocky and snobbish, constantly looking down on those less fortunate than herself, or sees herself as the rules of common society don&#x27;t apply to her simply because she is wealthy, which causes her friends to be upset with her. During those times, she derisively refers to the public at large as &quot;the common horde.&quot; At other times, when she can be snobbish, her father will punish her with having her credit cards confiscated.

Living in a house full of servants, Veronica often thinks that they are only there to serve her, and she doesn&#x27;t see them as people. She will often yell at her maids to bring her something and &quot;to be quick about it.&quot; At one point, her mother forced her to do all her own chores and fetch her own snacks, throughout the entire summer.

Even though they&#x27;re great friends in the TV series, her relationship with Jughead Jones is less friendly in the comics. They constantly argue and are critical of each other&#x27;s lifestyles. She cannot stand his laid-back attitude and witticisms, and he considers her an uncaring snob and enjoys arousing her temper. Jughead enjoys flouting her. However, Jughead and Veronica usually manage to stand being around each other for Archie&#x27;s sake.

Veronica, being the only child of her wealthy parents, is outrageously spoiled and indulged by her family. Her father, Mr. Lodge, loves her dearly, and even though he frequently loses his temper with her snobbishness, frivolity, spendthrift nature, and choice of boyfriends, he can never refuse when Veronica asks him for something. Mr. Lodge does not consider most of the local boys worthy of his only daughter.

Veronica&#x27;s cousin, Leroy, in Elementary School, has a mean-spirited, juvenile delinquent-like personality. When Leroy visits, he antagonizes Archie even more than Reggie does. Veronica has a young female cousin named Marcy, aged 14, who enjoys science fiction and other things that Veronica finds &quot;geeky.&quot; So Veronica considers her annoying. Most of the time, however, Marcy is helpful to Veronica, who discovers that her cousin is not so geeky after all.

Veronica also has an older (teenage) cousin Alice, who lives on the &quot;West Coast&quot;, who is so attractive that Veronica doesn&#x27;t trust Alice to be alone with Archie.

==Interests and personality==
Self-absorbed, insensitive, shallow, and easily succumbing to jealousy, the fashion-conscious Lodge stars the &quot;Archie&quot; spin-offs &quot;Betty and Veronica Magazine&quot; and &quot;Betty and Veronica Spectacular,&quot; as well as her own series, &quot;Veronica&quot;. Her foibles are commonly featured in stories. When upset, she has an extremely bad temper, which it is unwise to arouse. She is an impulsive shopper who cannot go long without buying clothes.

For example, she bought out every shoe store in Riverdale so she could have all the shoes which amounted to 200 pairs and so she could be totally exclusive and nobody else could have any shoes. This act of unbridled selfishness angers her father who grounds her indefinitely, orders her to return the shoes and cancels a party she wanted to throw, and she has a nightmare where she remade Riverdale in her own image, calling it Veronicaville. At first the idea of running the town her way, and basically being the queen was fun, but when Betty wore the same outfit she did, she naturally got upset and banished everyone out of town. When they leave for a new town to live in, and finally losing her father, when he leaves for greener pastures and she is left alone, she wakes up and finally wises up. She gives Betty the 200 pairs of shoes and throws the party she scheduled as a birthday party for her. (This was in a story called &quot;The Me-ning of life&quot;).

She is often addicted to gossip, which tends to aggravate Betty. Though commonly a cheerleader, her athletic abilities vary from superior to nonexistent, and she lacks domestic talents and many other skills that Betty has mastered. In fact, her cooking skills are so notoriously poor that the other characters literally fear for their lives when she tries to prepare a meal. Several stories portray Veronica as an expert at billiards, the reason being that her family owns a pool table, and she has been playing since she was a child.

At various times, she will take a common situation (for example being named the Most Popular Student in the Riverdale High School Yearbook) and make it into a full-blown situation aimed at increasing her already inflated ego.

Her best school subject is economics, and it is implied that she will eventually take over her father&#x27;s business. She also has worked as a fashion model. By 1968, Betty and Veronica join Archie&#x27;s band, The Archies. Betty plays the tambourine, Veronica plays the organ, and both sing accompaniment. In the 2000s, Veronica appeared a few times as Powerteen – a comic book character created by Chuck Clayton. She also enjoys traveling to exotic places, which was the basis for &quot;Veronica&#x27;s Passport&quot;.

Besides being in The Archies, Veronica also appeared alongside indirect namesakes The Veronicas (Australian twins Lisa and Jess Origliasso) on the &quot;Veronica #167&quot; cover and in the feature story, &quot;What&#x27;s in a Name?&quot;, which includes the duo performing in Riverdale and explaining to Veronica how she was an influence on their name. (The issue had been enabled after Archie Comics and Warner Music Group had settled their legal battle over the duo&#x27;s name by agreeing to a cross-promotion deal).

<doc id="99123" wikidata="Q108006" url="?curid=99123" title="Speed (1994 film)">
<text>Speed is a 1994 American action thriller film directed by Jan de Bont in his feature directorial debut, and written by Graham Yost. Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, and Sandra Bullock star in the film, alongside Joe Morton and Jeff Daniels in supporting roles.

The plot centers on a city bus rigged by a vengeful extortionist (Hopper) to explode if its speed drops below 50 miles per hour (80 km/h). Reeves plays an LAPD officer tasked with preventing the disaster, with Bullock portraying a passenger who becomes unexpectedly involved in the mission.

&quot;Speed&quot; premiered on June 10, 1994 by 20th Century Fox. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed $350 million worldwide against a $30-37 million budget, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1994. At the 67th Academy Awards, &quot;Speed&quot; won Best Sound. The film also won Best Sound and Best Editing at the 48th British Academy Film Awards.

A sequel, &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot;, was released on June 13, 1997, but performed poorly and was critically lambasted, receiving widespread criticism for Reeves&#x27;s absence and the film&#x27;s change in setting.

==Plot==

LAPD SWAT bomb disposal officers Jack Traven and Harry Temple are tasked with preventing a bombing on a city elevator containing 13 people, masterminded by a vengeful extortionist, Howard Payne. After narrowly rescuing the passengers, where Payne seemingly blows himself up, Jack and Harry are conferred medals in a ceremony. However, Payne, who survived, resurfaces with a new deadly scheme: a bomb planted on a city bus that will detonate if the bus slows below 50 miles per hour (80 km/h).

Jack receives the ultimatum from Payne—$3.7 million in ransom or the bomb will go off. Racing through traffic, Jack boards the bus, but a felon’s panic leads to the driver being shot. A passenger, Annie Porter, takes over driving. With the bomb armed and passengers aware of the threat, Jack contacts Harry for help while trying to keep the bus moving.

Despite Payne’s constant surveillance, Jack maneuvers the bus through several dangerous obstacles, including a gap in the freeway, and directs it to Los Angeles International Airport to prevent traffic issues. Meanwhile, Harry discovers Payne’s identity as a former Atlanta Police Department bomb squad officer and leads a SWAT team to his home. Most of the team, including Harry, is killed when Payne’s house explodes, leaving Jack to try and defuse the bomb alone. When that fails, he learns Payne is monitoring the bus through a hidden camera. A clever ruse involving looping the surveillance footage allows the passengers to escape, and the empty bus explodes while crashing into an empty cargo plane. After Payne realizes his plan’s been foiled, he kidnaps Annie and demands the ransom.

Jack chases Payne into the subway system. Payne straps an explosive vest to Annie, but his plans unravel when Jack fights back, resulting in Payne’s decapitation. Jack deactivates the vest, but the subway train cannot be stopped. Jack accelerates the train, causing it to derail and crash onto Hollywood Boulevard. Jack and Annie emerge unscathed and share a kiss as onlookers watch in amazement.

==Production==
===Writing===
Screenwriter Graham Yost was inspired to write &quot;Speed&quot; after hearing about the 1985 film &quot;Runaway Train&quot; from his father, Canadian television host Elwy Yost. Elwy mistakenly believed the train&#x27;s out-of-control situation was caused by a bomb, leading Graham to think that such a concept would work better on a bus. He initially envisioned a bomb that would detonate if the bus dropped below 20 mph, but a friend suggested raising the speed limit to 50 mph. The film&#x27;s ending was inspired by the 1976 film &quot;Silver Streak&quot;. Originally titled &quot;Minimum Speed&quot;, Yost renamed it &quot;Speed&quot; to avoid negative connotations associated with &quot;minimum&quot;.

Yost&#x27;s initial draft had the entire film set on the bus, with no elevator or subway sequences. The bus was meant to drive around Dodger Stadium and ultimately crash into the Hollywood Sign. After finishing the script, Yost presented it to Paramount Pictures, which showed interest and suggested John McTiernan to direct. However, McTiernan declined, feeling the script was too similar to &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988), and recommended Jan de Bont instead. De Bont, who had been the director of photography for action films like &quot;Die Hard&quot; and &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990), agreed to direct. Michael Bay had also expressed interest in directing.

Paramount ultimately passed on the project, believing audiences wouldn’t want to watch a film set almost entirely on a bus. Yost and de Bont then pitched the film to 20th Century Fox, who agreed to green-light the project but requested additional action sequences beyond the bus. De Bont suggested starting the movie with a bomb on an elevator, drawing from his own experience of being trapped in an elevator while working on &quot;Die Hard&quot;. Yost used this opening to establish the cleverness of LAPD SWAT officer Jack Traven, inspired by Perseus’ trickery with Medusa. De Bont also suggested concluding the film with a subway sequence to provide a final twist, which Fox approved.

Joss Whedon was brought in a week before filming began to rework the dialogue and improve the script. Whedon made significant contributions, including transforming Jack Traven’s character from a maverick hotshot into a more earnest and polite officer, removing forced one-liners, and creating the iconic line, &quot;Pop quiz, hotshot.&quot; Whedon also reworked minor characters, such as turning Doug Stephens (Alan Ruck) from a lawyer into a hapless tourist. Additionally, the character of Harry Temple was originally intended to be the film’s villain, but once Dennis Hopper was cast as Howard Payne, this role was adjusted, and Temple’s character remained non-complicit.

===Casting===
When &quot;Speed&quot; was under development at Paramount Pictures, Jeff Speakman was originally attached to star in the lead role. However, after the project was acquired by 20th Century Fox, Speakman was dropped. Stephen Baldwin was initially offered the role of Jack Traven but declined, citing the character’s similarity to John McClane from &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988). Richard Grieco also turned down the role, later expressing regret over his decision. Other actors considered for the part included Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, Wesley Snipes, and Woody Harrelson. Director Jan de Bont ultimately cast Keanu Reeves after seeing his performance in &quot;Point Break&quot; (1991), believing that Reeves projected a balance of vulnerability and strength. Reeves underwent physical training and shaved his head for the role, a decision that initially concerned the studio.

The character of Annie was originally written as an African American paramedic to justify her ability to drive the bus. The role was first offered to Halle Berry, who declined, but later expressed regret over her decision. As the character evolved into a comic relief sidekick, Ellen DeGeneres was considered for the part. Eventually, the role was rewritten as a love interest for Jack Traven, leading to the casting of Sandra Bullock. Bullock auditioned alongside Reeves to ensure their on-screen chemistry, which involved performing physically demanding scenes. Meryl Streep, Kim Basinger, and Anne Heche were also offered or considered for the role but declined.

===Filming===
Principal photography for &quot;Speed&quot; commenced on September 7, 1993, and concluded on December 23, 1993, in Los Angeles. Director Jan de Bont used an 80-foot model of a 50-story elevator shaft for the film’s opening sequence. During production, actor Keanu Reeves experienced the death of his close friend River Phoenix. In response, de Bont adjusted the shooting schedule to accommodate Reeves, giving him less demanding scenes. De Bont noted that the loss deeply affected Reeves, making him quieter and emotionally withdrawn. Initially hesitant about the film’s action sequences, Reeves expressed to de Bont, “I’m not an action hero. I don’t like it. I don’t know how to do it,” which de Bont saw as an advantage, believing it paralleled Reeves’ character, who was thrust into an extraordinary situation. As production progressed, Reeves became more involved with his stunts, even secretly rehearsing the Jaguar-to-bus jump, which he later performed himself, against de Bont&#x27;s approval.

The production utilized eleven GM New Look buses (TDH-5303) and three Grumman 870 buses. Two of these buses were destroyed in explosions, while others were adapted for specific scenes, including high-speed sequences, interior shots, and &quot;under bus&quot; scenes. The bus jump scene was filmed in one take using a specially rigged bus equipped with a ramp to allow for lift-off. The driver was suspended in a shock-absorbing harness to prevent injury during the landing. The film&#x27;s fictionalized bus route, &quot;33 Downtown&quot;, was modeled after the real-life Big Blue Bus serving Santa Monica. One of the buses used in the film was auctioned for $102,000 in 2018.

Many of the freeway scenes were shot on California&#x27;s Interstate 105 and Interstate 110, specifically at the Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange, which was under construction at the time of filming. De Bont noticed unfinished sections of the freeway during a location scout and suggested adding a bus jump to the script. The scene where the bus jumps over an incomplete freeway was achieved using a ramp to give the vehicle the necessary lift. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was later used to create the appearance of a gap in the freeway, aided by Sony Pictures Imageworks. A 2009 episode of &quot;MythBusters&quot; tested the feasibility of the bus jump and concluded that it was impossible under real-world conditions.

De Bont revealed in a DVD commentary that the bus jump stunt did not go as planned on the first attempt. The stunt driver missed the ramp, damaging the bus beyond repair. A second bus was prepared, and a successful jump was filmed two days later, although it traveled further than expected and destroyed one of the cameras set up to capture the landing. Fortunately, another camera, placed 90 feet from the jump ramp, recorded the stunt.

The film&#x27;s final scenes were shot at Mojave Airport, which stood in for Los Angeles International Airport. Shots of the LACMTA Metro Red Line during the film&#x27;s climactic subway sequence were created using an 1/8 scale model, except for the train derailment jump.

The MD520N helicopter featured in the film, registration N599DB, was later sold to the Calgary Police Service in 1995 and remained in use until 2006, after which it was sold to a private owner.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Speed&quot; was released on June 10, 1994, in 2,138 theaters across the United States and Canada. It debuted at number 1 at the US box-office, surpassing &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and &quot;City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly&#x27;s Gold&quot;, and grossing $14.5 million in its opening weekend. &quot;Speed&quot; held the number one position for a week before being overtaken by &quot;Wolf&quot;, generating $12.9 million in its second weekend. In its third weekend, despite the debut of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, the film retained second place at the box office. It enjoyed prolonged success in international markets, staying number one for 8 consecutive weeks in Australia and 10 weeks in Japan. The film set opening records for 20th Century Fox in South Korea with $216,077; Brazil with $669,725; and South Africa with $267,140. 

Overall, &quot;Speed&quot; grossed $121.3 million in the United States and Canada, with an additional $229.2 million internationally, for a total worldwide gross of $350.5 million. This far exceeded its production budget, estimated between $30 million and $37 million. The film remained Sandra Bullock&#x27;s highest-grossing film until &quot;Gravity&quot; surpassed it in 2013.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Speed&quot; holds a 95% approval rating based on 73 reviews, with an average rating of 8.10/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;A terrific popcorn thriller, &quot;Speed&quot; is taut, tense, and energetic, with outstanding performances from Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, and Sandra Bullock.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film 4 out of 4 stars, describing it as &quot;manic exhilaration&quot; and praised Reeves&#x27;s transition into a credible action hero, while also commending Hopper&#x27;s performance as the film&#x27;s villain. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked that &quot;&quot;Speed&quot; works like a charm,&quot; highlighting its entertainment value. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Hopper’s portrayal of &quot;crazy menace&quot; and noted the film’s swift pacing, which left little room for character development but maintained momentum. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film an &quot;A&quot; rating, lauding director Jan de Bont’s craftsmanship, and Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; noted the film’s ability to tap into common anxieties, calling it an effective thriller.

The film has also received long-term recognition. Quentin Tarantino named &quot;Speed&quot; as one of the top 20 films he had seen between 1992 and 2009. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked the film eighth on its list of &quot;The Best Rock-&#x27;em, Sock-&#x27;em Movies of the Past 25 Years.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; included &quot;Speed&quot; in its &quot;500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot; list in 2008, ranking it #451. In 2017, BBC&#x27;s Mark Kermode revisited the film and declared it a &quot;timeless masterpiece,&quot; praising its enduring appeal as an action classic.

==Music==
===Soundtrack===
A soundtrack album featuring &quot;songs from and inspired by&quot; the film was released on June 28, 1994, with the following tracks. The soundtrack was commercially successful in Japan, being certified gold by the RIAJ in 2002.

===Score===
Michael Kamen was initially considered to do the score of the movie, however De Bont chose Mark Mancina, who at the time worked in some Hans Zimmer scores like &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;, &quot;Where Sleeping Dogs Lie&quot; and &quot;True Romance&quot;.

In addition to the soundtrack release, a separate album featuring 40 minutes of Mark Mancina&#x27;s score from the film was released on August 30, 1994, by 20th Century Fox Film Scores.

La-La Land Records and Fox Music released a limited expanded version of Mark Mancina&#x27;s score on February 28, 2012. The newly remastered release features 69:25 of music spread over 32 tracks (in chronological order). In addition, it includes the song &quot;Speed&quot; by Billy Idol.

==Sequel==

On June 13, 1997, &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Speed&quot;, was released to overwhelming negative reviews and poor box-office performance. Sandra Bullock reprised her role as Annie, reportedly in exchange for financial backing on another project, but Keanu Reeves declined to return as Jack Traven. As a result, Jason Patric was cast as Alex Shaw, Annie’s new boyfriend, with the storyline explaining that she and Jack had broken up due to her concerns over Jack’s dangerous profession. Willem Dafoe portrayed the villain, John Geiger, while Glenn Plummer, who played a carjacking victim in the first film, made a cameo as the same character, this time involved with a boat. &quot;Speed 2&quot; is widely regarded as one of the worst sequels ever made, holding a 4% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 71 reviews.

==Legacy==

* &quot;MythBusters&quot;″ 2009 season tested the real-world viability of the film&#x27;s bus jump scene.
* The film is parodied in the UK Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot;, in the 1998 episode &quot;Speed 3&quot;, where Father Dougal drives a booby-trapped milk float that will explode if its speed falls below 4 mph.
* In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Springfield Files&quot;, the film is cited by Homer Simpson as the inspiration for his idea to use old CCTV footage to allow him and his friends to go drinking, though he believes it is called &quot;The Bus That Couldn&#x27;t Slow Down&quot;.
* A hidden mission in &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; features the player having to drive a bus at speed, with the vehicle exploding in the event that it slows down too much.
* The mission &quot;Publicity Tour&quot; from &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; was inspired by the movie. Also, a character named Steve Scott was voiced by Dennis Hopper.
* The level &quot;Velocity&quot; in the video game &quot;Pursuit Force&quot; is an adaptation of the main premise of the movie.
* A clip of &quot;Speed&quot; is seen in the 2020 live-action/CGI film &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, in which the title character considers it one of his favorite action films and quotes some lines from the film. Keanu Reeves would later voice Shadow the Hedgehog in the third installment in the series, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; (2024). Paramount Pictures posted the clip of Sonic watching &quot;Speed&quot; to the film&#x27;s official TikTok account with the caption &quot;foreSHADOWing&quot; to announce the casting.
* In the 2018 video game &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, the title character can mention that a crime committed by the Demon Gang involving an armed bomb inside of a truck is similar to the plot of the film. In the voice line, he attempts to recall the name of the film, suggesting &quot;&quot;Fastness&quot; and &quot;Super Quick&quot;&quot;.
* In 2018, the vehicle simulator BeamNG.drive released an update featuring a new campaign titled &quot;Hustle and Bustle&quot; inspired by the movie. The bomb detonates when the bus is driven with a speed under 55 km/h for more than 10 seconds.
* A sequence in the 1997 anime film &quot;Detective Conan: The Time-Bombed Skyscraper&quot; involves a train on the city&#x27;s &quot;loop line&quot; being threatened by bombs that will detonate should the speed of the train go under 60 kmph. The bombs are revealed to have sensors that react to sunlight, so each time a train passes over one at full speed, it does so with just enough time to reset the bombs countdown timers.
* Webcomic series Cyanide &amp; Happiness made an animated short film named &quot;Waiting for the Bus&quot;, a man who waits in bus stop starts to catch the bus because it doesn&#x27;t slow down due to bomb on its board. The man succeeds to catch the bus and eventually becomes world&#x27;s fastest man.

<text>A national trust is an organisation dedicated to preserving the cultural heritage of a particular geographic region. Although the focus may vary by region, the principal goals are to ensure the preservation of historically significant items and conserve areas of natural beauty. They generally operate as private non-profit organisations. 

The first such trust organisation, The Trustees of Reservations, originated in 1890 as a regional group serving the state of Massachusetts, USA. The first on a national level, the National Trust, was founded in England in 1895 and operates as a charitable organisation serving England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Others were later founded around the world.

In 2007 the International National Trusts Organisation was established at a gathering in New Delhi, India, with a mandate to support collaboration and best practices among national trusts and similar associations, with member organisations from over 50 countries.

<doc id="99147" wikidata="Q772193" url="?curid=99147" title="Fernando Vargas">
<text>Fernando Javier Vargas (born December 7, 1977) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1997 to 2007. He was a two-time light middleweight world champion, having held the IBF title from 1998 to 2000, and the WBA title from 2001 to 2002. As an amateur he won a bronze medal in the light welterweight division at the 1995 Pan American Games, and reached the second round of the welterweight bracket at the 1996 Olympics.

Vargas is best known for his heated rivalries against Felix Trinidad, Oscar De La Hoya, Shane Mosley, and Ricardo Mayorga.

==Amateur career==
In his youth Vargas compiled a remarkable amateur record of 100–5. In 1992, he won the 132 lb. championships at the Junior Olympics Box-Offs, and came in second at the Junior Olympics. In 1993, he captured the triple crown of amateur boxing: the Junior Olympics Box-Offs, the Junior Olympics, and the Junior Olympics International tournament. The following year he solidified his position as one of the premier amateur fighters in the world by winning the 132 lb gold medal at the Olympic Festival, seizing the U.S. Junior Championships at 132 lb, and by becoming the youngest fighter ever to win the U.S. Championships. In 1995, he was selected to the 1996 U.S. Olympic Team.

Vargas lost a controversial decision in the second round of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. He was scheduled to turn pro in November 1996, however, while training for his debut bout he broke his right hand. Eager to turn pro and begin his march toward a world championship, Vargas &quot;ferociously&quot; followed his physical therapy program, and within five months he was ready for his professional debut.

===Amateur achievements===
*Won the 132-lb Junior Olympics Box-Offs; came in second at the Junior Olympics (1992)
*Won the Junior Olympics Box-Offs, the Junior Olympics, and the Junior Olympics International tournament (1993)
*Won the 132-lb gold medal at the U.S. Olympic Festival (1994), seizing the U.S. Championships at 132 pounds, becoming the youngest boxer ever to win the U.S. Championships (Seniors).
* Participated at the 1994 World Junior Championships, losing in the quarter-finals.
* 1995 Pan American Games Bronze Medalist in Mar Del Plata (ARG)
*Selected to the 1996 U.S. Olympic Team, defeated Tengiz Meskhadze (Georgia) 10–4, but lost to Marian Simion (Romania) 7–8 in the second bout.

==Professional career==
In his professional debut on March 25, 1997, Vargas crushed Jorge Morales in just 56 seconds. He quickly beat his next five opponents, spending only eight rounds in his first six bouts. By the time of his first world championship he won all his 14 bouts by knockout. He won his first world title in 1998, knocking out Yori Boy Campas in seven rounds for the IBF light middleweight championship. Vargas successfully defended the title throughout 1999, with victories over Howard Clarke (TKO 4), Raúl Márquez (TKO 11), Winky Wright (MD 12), and Ike Quartey (UD 12).

===Trinidad vs. Vargas===
Vargas lost the title to Félix Trinidad in 2000. Vargas was knocked down twice in the first round, he was able to fight his way back by knocking down Trinidad in the fourth round until finally being knocked out in the 12th and final round.

===Legal troubles===
In 2001 Vargas was sentenced to 90 days in House Arrest stemming from a 1999 assault charge. Vargas and four friends were originally charged with assault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy to commit a crime stemming from a July 25, 1999, altercation at a Summerland, California home. The defendants were accused of assaulting Doug Rossi, 23, who had broken up a fight between Vargas and a female friend&#x27;s ex-boyfriend.

===De La Hoya vs. Vargas===
*On September 14, 2002, Vargas surrendered his WBA title to Oscar De La Hoya in a historical light middleweight championship unification showdown that filled the Mandalay Bay Events Center to capacity and sold approximately one million pay-per-view buys.
*In the early rounds Vargas bullied De La Hoya against the ropes and landed right hands to the head and body; however, in the middle and late rounds Vargas fatigued and De La Hoya&#x27;s hand speed took over. After hurting Vargas at the end of round 10, De La Hoya dropped Vargas in the next round with a left hook to the head, and stopped him moments later with a flurry at the 1:48 mark of the round.
*During the mandatory drug testing after the de la Hoya fight, Vargas tested positive for the banned steroid stanozolol better known as Winstrol. Vargas said the steroids were given to him without his knowledge, but he accepted full responsibility. The Nevada Athletic Commission announced on November 20, 2002, that it would fine Vargas $100,000 because of his use of steroids. Fernando Vargas was suspended for nine months.

===Comeback trail===
Despite these problems, Fernando remained an accessible and popular celebrity, known for signing many autographs. After his knockout win over Fitz Vanderpool on July 26, 2003, he stood in a corner and yelled &quot;I love you guys!&quot; to his fans. Vargas continued his comeback, on December 12, with a seventh-round knockout of Tony Marshall that was shown live nationwide from Tucson, on TeleFutura. During that fight, Vargas injured a disc in his back, and his doctor recommended surgery, but Vargas chose to rehabilitate his back himself without having the procedure. This caused him to spend almost two years in inactivity, but, on March 26, 2005, he returned to boxing with a ten-round unanimous decision win over Ray Joval in Corpus Christi, Texas.

On August 20, 2005, he returned to the boxing ring to fight fellow former world light middleweight champion Javier Castillejo of Spain. Vargas dropped Castillejo in the third round, but he apparently broke his right hand and went on to win by a ten-round unanimous decision.

===Mosley vs. Vargas I &amp; II===
On February 25, 2006, Vargas once again returned to the ring to face fellow Southern California boxer Sugar Shane Mosley. In a tightly contested battle, Vargas&#x27; left eye became grotesquely swollen and referee Joe Cortez decided to stop the fight in the 10th round to minimize further damage, granting a technical knockout (TKO) victory to Mosley. The reasoning behind the stoppage, explained Nevada State Athletic Commission czar Marc Ratner, was that the referee and the fight doctor deemed that Vargas was unable to defend himself adequately against Mosley&#x27;s right-hand shots. At the time of the stoppage, two judges had Mosley winning the fight 86–85. One judge had Vargas winning the fight 86–85. Fightnews.com had the bout scored 86-85 for Mosley. In the post fight press conference, Vargas made it clear that he would resume his boxing career and stated that a rematch with Mosley should be in order because the match was stopped on a technicality. ESPN boxing expert Dan Rafael wrote: &quot;Vargas is so utterly delusional about what actually happened in his first fight with Mosley that we think he might have a concussion. When will he stop lying to himself -- and when will his team stop going along with him? He needs to admit that: (a) The swelling around his eye was caused by a clean punch, not a headbutt; and (b) He was not winning the fight when it was stopped in the 10th round.&quot;

In their highly anticipated July 15, 2006, rematch, Vargas was stopped in the 6th round via TKO. When the sixth round began, Mosley landed a huge left hook that sent Vargas crashing to the canvas. Vargas rolled over onto all fours and was unsteady, but after stumbling twice he finally beat referee Kenny Bayless&#x27; count. Moments later, Mosley unleashed another flurry as Vargas could only protect his face, and the referee stopped the fight at 2:38 as a beaten and disoriented Vargas staggered back to his corner.

===Showdown with Ricardo Mayorga===
It was confirmed on May 13, 2007, that Vargas would face Ricardo Mayorga on September 8, 2007, on Showtime PPV for the vacant WBC Continental Americas super middleweight title. However the fight was postponed after it was discovered during a routine blood test that Vargas was suffering from a severe iron deficiency. Doctors ordered Vargas not to participate in the upcoming bout until he received the necessary weeks of treatment to correct the problem. When the bout eventually took place it would be fought at 162 pounds, a weight that neither boxer has ever fought at. Many sources claim that Vargas had complained about fighting at the Jr. Middleweight limit of 154 pounds, stating that it&#x27;s &quot;too much for his body to take&quot;. Vargas has stated that fighting at that weight was the reason he did poorly against Mosley in the second fight.

Vargas claimed that this would be the last fight of his career regardless of the result. He warned Mayorga that he would not tolerate any insults from him like the ones he hurled at Oscar De La Hoya in their press conferences. Vargas stayed true to his promise when at the first official press conference for the fight, Mayorga said some offensive things towards Vargas and attempted to slap him. Vargas immediately jumped up from his seat and retaliated with punches and a brawl broke out between the two fighters&#x27; camps, though order was quickly restored. Vargas also recalled the time when Mayorga said Vargas was scared of him when he had defeated Javier Castillejo, then was stripped of his WBC light middleweight title rather than face Mayorga, who then defeated Michele Piccirillo for the vacant title. Ultimately the contestants faced off, and Mayorga defeated Vargas by majority decision on November 23, 2007. The scores were 113-113, 114–112, and 115–111. Crucially, Vargas was knocked down in the 1st round and again in the 11th round. Post-fight Ricardo Mayorga apologized to Vargas and the two forgave each other. Vargas officially declared his retirement soon after.

===Cancelled return to boxing in 2011===
It was confirmed that after a three-year hiatus, former world champion Fernando Vargas would return to the boxing ring against super middleweight Henry Buchanan on April 16, 2011, at Hard Rock Casino in Las Vegas. However, the fight was canceled for unknown reasons.

==Acting career==
Vargas had a role in the 2006 crime drama film &quot;Alpha Dog&quot;, playing the character Tiko &quot;TKO&quot; Martinez.
Vargas also played an unnamed guest star on the television show &quot;Moesha&quot;, in the season two episode &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out.&quot;

==Reality television series==
In 2014, Vargas and his family became the subjects of a reality show on Mun2 television station, &quot;Welcome to Los Vargas&quot;. He also participated, alongside Judith Grace, Maripily, Pedro Rivera and Sissi Fleitas, among others, in the Telemundo reality contest, &quot;Top Chef Celebrity.&quot;

<doc id="99148" wikidata="Q192372" url="?curid=99148" title="Luna programme">
<text>The Luna programme (from the Russian word &quot;Luna&quot; meaning &quot;Moon&quot;), occasionally called &quot;Lunik&quot; by western media, was a series of robotic spacecraft missions sent to the Moon by the Soviet Union between 1959 and 1976. The programme accomplished many firsts in space exploration, including first flyby of the Moon, first impact of the Moon and first photos of the far side of the Moon. Each mission was designed as either an orbiter or lander. They also performed many experiments, studying the Moon&#x27;s chemical composition, gravity, temperature, and radiation.

Twenty-four spacecraft were formally given the Luna designation, although more were launched. Those that failed to reach orbit were not publicly acknowledged at the time, and not assigned a Luna number. Those that failed in low Earth orbit were usually given Cosmos designations. The estimated cost of the Luna programme in 1964 was US$6–10 billion (equivalent to US$– billion in ). The Luna 25 mission also continues the Luna designation, although it is considered to be a part of the Luna-Glob exploration programme. The same applies to other planned missions such as Luna 26, Luna 27 and Luna 28.

== Mission types ==

The name &quot;Luna&quot; was used to designate a variety of spacecraft designs, to achieve several types of missions:

=== Impactors ===

Impactor spacecraft had the generic designation of Ye-1 (or E-1 depending on transliteration from Russian) and were designed to hit the near side of the Moon. Luna 1 (January 1959) missed its intended impact with the Moon and became the first spacecraft to escape the Earth-Moon system. Luna 2 (September 1959) mission successfully hit the Moon&#x27;s surface, becoming the first man-made object to reach the Moon. This was Luna&#x27;s only impact success out of six tries from September 1958 to September 1959.

=== Flybys ===

A flyby is the simplest lunar spacecraft, requiring neither a propulsion device for slowing, nor a guidance system sensitive enough to hit the Moon. Flyby spacecraft had the generic designations of Ye-2 and Ye-3 (E-2 and E-3 depending on transliteration from Russian). Their function was to transmit photographs back to Earth. Luna 3 (October 1959) rounded the Moon later that year, and returned the first photographs of its far side, which can never be seen from Earth. This was Luna&#x27;s only successful flyby, out of three tries from October 1959 to April 1960.

=== Soft landers ===
Soft landers require rocket propulsion to slow their speed sufficiently to prevent the craft&#x27;s destruction. They can continue to transmit pictures from the surface, and possibly dig into the lunar soil or return other information about the lunar environment. 

Luna program landers had the generic designations of Ye-6 or Ye-6M (E-6 or E-6M depending on transliteration from Russian). Two successful soft landings were achieved out of thirteen attempts from January 1963 to December 1966. 

Luna 9 (&quot;E-6 No.13&quot;) became the first probe to achieve a soft landing on another planetary body in February 1966. It transmitted five black and white stereoscopic circular panoramas, which were the first close-up shots of the lunar surface. 

=== Orbiters ===

Orbiter spacecraft require less thrust and propellant than landers, but still require enough to achieve lunar orbit insertion. Luna 10 (March 1966) became the first artificial satellite of the Moon. Luna program orbiters had the generic designations of Ye-6LF, Ye-6LS, Ye-6S or Ye-8LS (E-6, E-6LS, E-6S or E-8LS depending on transliteration from Russian). Luna flew six successful orbiters out of eight attempts from March 1966 to May 1974.

=== Rovers ===
More sophisticated soft lander craft can deploy wheeled vehicles to explore a wider area of the lunar surface than the immediate landing site. Luna program landers with rovers had the generic designations of Ye-8 (E-8 depending on transliteration from Russian).

The first attempted Lunokhod failed in February 1969. Luna 17 (November 1970) and Luna 21 (January 1973) carried Lunokhod vehicles, which were the first robotic wheeled vehicles to explore the Moon&#x27;s terrain. Lunokhod 1 travelled in 322 days and returned more than 20,000 television images and 206 high-resolution panoramas. Lunokhod 2 operated for about four months, and covered of terrain, A third Lunokhod was built and intended for launch in 1977, but never flew due to lack of launchers and funding.

=== Sample return ===
More complex soft lander craft can robotically scoop up a small amount of lunar material, lift off from the surface, and return the material to Earth. Luna program sample return landers had the generic designations of Ye-8-5 or Ye-8-5M (E-8-5 or E-8-5M depending on transliteration from Russian).

Luna 16 (September 1970), Luna 20 (February 1972) and Luna 24 (August 1976), returned samples of lunar soil to Earth. A total of of soil sample was returned from the three missions.

Luna 15 (July 1969) flew at the same time as the Apollo 11 mission. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had already performed the first crewed lunar landing when Luna 15 began its descent, and the spacecraft crashed into a mountain minutes later.

== Mission success rates ==
While the programme was active, it was Soviet practice not to release any details of missions that had failed to achieve orbit. This resulted in Western observers assigning their own designations to the missions. For example, Luna E-1 No.1, the first failure of 1958 which NASA believed was associated with the Luna programme, was known as Luna 1958A.

<doc id="99150" wikidata="Q2735090" url="?curid=99150" title="Axel Olrik">
<text>Axel Olrik (3 July 1864 – 17 February 1917) was a Danish folklorist and scholar of mediaeval historiography, and a pioneer in the methodical study of oral narrative.

Olrik was born in Frederiksberg, the son of the artist Henrik Olrik. Artist Dagmar Olrik, judge Eyvind Olrik, historian Hans Olrik and cultural historian Jørgen Olrik were his siblings.

==Career==
Olrik began his studies at the University of Copenhagen in 1881. In 1886, he won the university gold medal for an essay on the age of the Eddic poems; he received his Master of Arts in Nordic Philology in 1887 and his Ph.D. in 1892. The following year, he became a private docent at the university. On 1 April 1896 he was awarded a temporary position in Scandinavian folklore, which on 9 April 1913 was converted into an extraordinary professorship. Apart from a period at Kristiania (now Oslo) in 1892 studying with Moltke Moe, he spent his entire career at the University of Copenhagen.

==Scholarly work==
===Folklore===
While a student, Olrik soon came under the influence of Svend Grundtvig, and until the latter&#x27;s death in 1883, was treated almost like a son. His first major scholarly work was therefore a continuation of Grundtvig&#x27;s work on the Danish ballads; with &quot;Danske Ridderviser&quot; (1898–1919) he continued the publication of &quot;Danmarks gamle Folkeviser&quot;, which was in turn continued after his own death by his pupil Hakon Grüner-Nielsen. Olrik was able to draw more than Grundtvig on collected oral material; in 1888–89 he himself did some fieldwork collecting folksongs.

Grundtvig had amalgamated what he considered useful features from various versions of a folksong or ballad to produce a long, complex whole; Olrik, in contrast, sought to trace the history of the oral texts back to simple originals. He published several sample studies in &quot;Danske Studier&quot;, the journal he co-founded with Marius Kristensen in 1904, and in 1899–1909, with Ida Falbe-Hansen, he published a collection of reconstructed texts, &quot;Danske Folkeviser i Udvalg&quot; (Selection of Danish Folk Songs); in 1899–1904, an edition with melodic arrangements by Thomas Laub was published. These were very popular and were translated into German and English.

In addition to &quot;Danske Studier&quot;, Olrik together with Henning Frederik Feilberg and H. O. Lange founded the Danish folklore archive (&quot;Dansk Folkemindesamling&quot;), and served as its first president. He was also the first president of Danmarks Folkeminder, an association founded in 1908, and set up its committees for the study of folklore material and of placenames, both of which are now research institutes at the University of Copenhagen. In addition, with Kaarle Krohn and C. W. von Sydow, he co-founded the international organisation of Folklore Fellows in 1907, and the first issue of &quot;Folklore Fellows&#x27; Communications&quot;, of which he was co-editor from its inception in 1910, consists of an account by him of the Danish folklore archive. Upon his death, his professorship and with it folklore studies at the University of Copenhagen came to an end; the field was only revived in 1961.

===Mediaeval historiography and culture===
Olrik&#x27;s Ph.D. dissertation, &quot;Forsøg på en tvedeling af kilderne til Sakses oldhistorie&quot; (&quot;Attempts at a two-part division of the sources for Saxo&#x27;s history of the Danes&quot;), was on the sources of Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; Latin history of the Danes, &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;. Based on the presence or absence of West Norse names and familiarity with West Norse geography and with material in pre-existing Icelandic historical works, he believed it was possible to distinguish passages in which Saxo had drawn on Norwegian and Icelandic sources and those where he had used native Danish traditions. This work led him to the view that the religious, heroic and historical traditions of the different Scandinavian peoples had already diverged by the Viking Age, and he sought to trace the origins, development and regional variation of individual works and concepts. He published many articles on Scandinavian religion, onomastics, and related subjects, including an interpretation of the images on the Golden Horns of Gallehus which was published in 1918, after his death, studies of Ragnarök, and a book on Scandinavian paganism in the Viking Age, &quot;Nordisk Åndsliv i Vikingetid og tidlig Middelalder&quot;, all of which were revised and completed by his student Hans Ellekilde and published in 1926 and 1951 as &quot;Nordens Gudeverden&quot;.

Olrik eventually developed a system for the study of oral narrative (which he called &quot;sagn&quot; - &#x27;saga&#x27;), including principles for the study of sources (developed with Kristian Erslev), a theory of transmission and most influentially, a theory of form which he called &quot;epic laws&quot;. This was based on an idea of Moltke Moe&#x27;s, but Olrik&#x27;s approach is structural whereas Moe sought to derive rules for the historical development of narratives. His unfinished work on the study of oral narrative was published posthumously in 1921 by Ellekilde as &quot;Nogle grundsætninger for sagnforskning&quot;.

==Private life==
In 1893 he married Margrete Sofie Eleonore Hasselquist, who died in November 1911. He died in Øverød on 17 February 1917 from pneumonia following a successful operation on his ear.

==Honours==
In 1911 Olrik was named the first external member of the Finnish Academy of Sciences. In 1914 he was elected foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<text>Luna 5, or E-6 No.10 (Ye-6 series), was an uncrewed Soviet spacecraft intended to land on the Moon as part of the Luna programme. It was intended to become the first spacecraft to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, however its retrorockets failed, and the spacecraft impacted the lunar surface.

==Launch==
&quot;Luna 5&quot; was launched by a Molniya-M carrier rocket, flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Liftoff occurred at 07:49:37 UTC on 9 May 1965. The spacecraft and Blok L upper stage entered a low Earth parking orbit, before the Blok L fired to propel &quot;Luna 5&quot; towards the Moon.

&quot;Luna 5&quot; became the first Soviet probe to be successfully launched towards the Moon in two years. Between it and the previous mission to be launched successfully, &quot;Luna 4&quot;, there were three launch failures: &quot;E-6 No.6&quot; and &quot;No.5&quot; in 1964 and &quot;Kosmos 60&quot; in 1965.

==Failure==

Following the mid-course correction on 10 May, the spacecraft began spinning around its main axis due to a problem in a flotation gyroscope in the I-100 guidance system unit. A subsequent attempt to fire the main engine failed because of ground control error, and the engine never fired. As a result of these failures, the soft landing attempt failed, and &quot;Luna 5&quot; impacted the Moon. The place of impact was first announced as (coast of Mare Nubium), but later it was estimated as (near crater Copernicus). It was the second Soviet spacecraft to reach the surface of the Moon, following &quot;Luna 2&quot; in 1959. The Abastumani Astrophysical Observatory registered television images of the failed landing noted that shown it produced a plume which was visible for ten minutes. A 2017 analysis of the reprocessed images allowed to refine the impact coordinates, provide an altitude estimate of 3.7−3.9 km for the generated gas cloud and corroborate estimations published for the 2009 LCROSS impact.

<text>Luna 6, or E-6 No.7 (Ye-6 series) was an uncrewed Soviet spacecraft which was intended to perform a landing on the Moon as part of the Luna program. Due to the failure of a mid-course correction manoeuvre, &quot;Luna 6&quot; failed to land, instead flying past the Moon at a distance of .

==Launch==
&quot;Luna 6&quot; was launched by a Molniya-M carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Liftoff occurred at 07:40 UTC on 8 June 1965, with the spacecraft and Blok L upper stage entering a low Earth parking orbit, before the upper stage propelled the spacecraft into a heliocentric orbit passing the Moon.

==Failure==
The &quot;Luna 6&quot; mission proceeded as planned until a scheduled mid-course correction late on 9 June. Although the spacecraft&#x27;s S5.5A main engine ignited on time, it failed to cut off and continued to fire until its propellant supply was exhausted. An investigation later determined that the problem had been due to a command which had been mistakenly sent to the timer that ordered the main engine to shut down.

Despite the spacecraft being unable to land on the Moon, controllers used the spacecraft to simulate a landing; a task which was satisfactorily accomplished. &quot;Luna 6&quot; flew past the Moon late on 11 June, with a closest approach of . Contact was maintained to a distance of from Earth.

<text>Luna 7 (E-6 or Ye-6 series) was an uncrewed space mission of the Soviet Luna program, also called Lunik 7. 

== Mission ==
The &quot;Luna 7&quot; spacecraft was intended to achieve a soft landing on the Moon. However, due to premature retrofire and cutoff of the retrorockets, the spacecraft impacted the lunar surface in Oceanus Procellarum.
Unlike its predecessors, Luna 7 successfully carried out its mid-course correction on October 5 on the way to the Moon, in anticipation of a soft-landing two days later. However, immediately prior to planned retro-fire during the approach to the lunar surface, the spacecraft suddenly lost attitude control and failed to regain it. Automatic programmed systems then prevented the main engine from firing. As controllers observed helplessly, &quot;Luna 7&quot; plummeted to the lunar surface at a very high speed, crashing at 22:08:24 UT on October 7, 1965, west of the Kepler crater, relatively near the actual intended target. Impact coordinates were .

Later investigation indicated that the optical sensor of the astronavigation system had been set at the wrong angle and had lost sight of Earth during the critical attitude-control maneuver. It was the tenth consecutive failure in the Ye-6 program.

<text>Luna 8 (E-6 or Ye-6 series), also known as Lunik 8, was a lunar space probe of the Luna program.

== Mission ==

It was launched in on 3 December 1965 with the objective of achieving a soft landing on the Moon; however, its retrorocket firing occurred too late, and suffered a hard impact on the lunar surface on the Oceanus Procellarum (Ocean of Storms). The mission did complete the experimental testing of its stellar-guidance system and the ground-control of its radio telemetry equipment, its flight trajectory, and its other instrumentation.

This, the eleventh Soviet attempt to achieve a lunar soft landing, nearly succeeded. After a successful midcourse correction on 4 December, this spacecraft headed toward the Moon without any apparent problems. Just before the scheduled firing of its retrorocket, a command was sent to inflate cushioning air bags around the landing probe. However, a plastic mounting bracket apparently pierced one of the two air bags. The resulting ejection of the air put the spacecraft into a spin of about 12 degrees per second. The spacecraft momentarily regained its proper attitude, long enough for a nine-second-long retrorocket firing, but &quot;Luna 8&quot; became unstable again. Without a retrorocket burn long enough to reduce its velocity sufficiently for a survivable landing, &quot;Luna 8&quot; plummeted to the lunar surface and crashed at 21:51:30 UT on 6 December in the west of Oceanus Procellarum. The coordinates of the crash site are .

<text>Luna 9 (Луна-9), internal designation Ye-6 No.13, was an uncrewed space mission of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Luna programme. On 3 February 1966, the Luna 9 spacecraft became the first spacecraft to achieve a soft landing on the Moon and return imagery from its surface.

==Spacecraft==
The spacecraft carrying on top the lander capsule, weighed together 1538 kg and was 2.7 meters tall. It commenced the main descent, shortly before its controlled impact it ejected the lander capsule.
The lander had a mass of and consisted of a spheroid &quot;Automatic Lunar Station&quot; (ALS) capsule measuring . It used a landing bag to survive the impact speed of over . It was a hermetically sealed container with radio equipment, a program timing device, heat control systems, scientific apparatus, power sources, and a television system.

The spacecraft was developed in the design bureau then known as OKB-1, under Chief Designer Sergei Korolev (who had died before the launch). The first 11 Luna missions were unsuccessful for a variety of reasons. At that time the project was transferred to Lavochkin design bureau since OKB-1 was busy with a human expedition to the Moon. &quot;Luna 9&quot; was the twelfth attempt at a soft-landing by the Soviet Union; it was also the first successful deep space probe built by the Lavochkin design bureau, which ultimately would design and build almost all Soviet (later Russian) lunar and interplanetary spacecraft. 

==Launch and translunar coast==
&quot;Luna 9&quot; was launched by a Molniya-M rocket, serial number 103-32, flying from Site 31/6 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. Liftoff took place at 11:41:37 GMT on 31 January 1966. The first three stages of the four-stage carrier rocket injected the payload and fourth stage into low Earth orbit, at an altitude of and an inclination of 51.8°. The fourth stage, a Blok-L, then fired to raise the perigee of the orbit to a new apogee approximately , before deploying &quot;Luna 9&quot; into a highly elliptical geocentric orbit.

For thermal control, the spacecraft then spun itself up to 0.67 rpm using nitrogen jets. On 1 February at 19:29 GMT, a mid-course correction took place involving a 48-second burn and resulting in a delta-v of .

==Descent and landing==

At an altitude of from the Moon, the spacecraft was oriented for the firing of its retrorockets and its spin was stopped in preparation for landing. From this moment the orientation of the spacecraft was supported by measurements of directions to the Sun and the Earth using an optomechanical system. At above the lunar surface, the radar altimeter triggered the jettison of the side modules, the inflation of the airbags and the firing of the retro rockets. At from the surface, the main retrorocket was turned off by the integrator of an acceleration having reached the planned velocity of the braking manoeuver. The four outrigger engines were used to slow the craft. About above the lunar surface, a contact sensor touched the ground triggering the engines to be shut down and the landing capsule to be ejected and its landing airbag being inflated. The capsule landed at .

The capsule bounced several times before coming to rest in Oceanus Procellarum west of Reiner and Marius craters at approximately 7.08 N, 64.37 W (other sources indicate ) on 3 February 1966 at 18:45:30 GMT.

== Surface operations ==
Approximately 250 seconds after landing in the Oceanus Procellarum, four petals that covered the top half of the spacecraft opened outward for increased stability. Seven hours after (to allow for the Sun to climb to 7° elevation) the probe began sending the first of nine images (including five panoramas) of the surface of the Moon. Seven radio sessions with a total of 8 hours and 5 minutes were transmitted, as well as a series of three TV pictures. After assembly the photographs gave a panoramic view of the immediate lunar surface, comprising views of nearby rocks and of the horizon, away.

The pictures from &quot;Luna 9&quot; were not released immediately by the Soviet authorities, but scientists at Jodrell Bank Observatory in England, which was monitoring the craft, noticed that the signal format used was identical to the internationally agreed Radiofax system used by newspapers for transmitting pictures. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; rushed a suitable receiver to the Observatory and the pictures from &quot;Luna 9&quot; were decoded and published worldwide. The BBC speculated that the spacecraft&#x27;s designers deliberately fitted the probe with equipment conforming to the standard, to enable reception of the pictures by Jodrell Bank Observatory.

The radiation detector, the only dedicated scientific instrument on board, measured dosage of 30 millirads (0.3 milligrays) per day. The mission also determined that a spacecraft would not sink into the lunar dust; that the ground could support a lander. The last contact with the spacecraft was at 22:55 GMT on 6 February 1966.

== Models and displays ==
Detailed Luna 9 models are on display at the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics, Tsiolkovsky State Museum of the History of Cosmonautics, Museum of Cosmonautics and Rocket Technology, Museum of Air and Space Paris and other locations.

== Stamps ==
The successful Luna 9 landing was commemorated on stamps.

<text>Luna 10 (or Lunik 10) was a 1966 Soviet lunar robotic spacecraft mission in the Luna program. It was the first artificial satellite of the Moon.

Luna 10 conducted extensive research in lunar orbit, gathering important data on the strength of the Moon&#x27;s magnetic field, its radiation belts, and the nature of lunar rocks (which were found to be comparable to terrestrial basalt rocks), cosmic radiation, and micrometeoroid density. Perhaps its most important finding was the first evidence of mass concentrations (called &quot;mascons&quot;) — areas of denser material below the lunar surface that distort lunar orbital trajectories.

==The spacecraft==
Part of the &quot;E-6S&quot; series, Luna 10 was battery powered and had an on-orbit dry mass of 540 kg. Scientific instruments included a gamma-ray spectrometer for energies between 0.3–3 MeV (50–500 pJ), a triaxial magnetometer, a meteorite detector, instruments for solar-plasma studies, and devices for measuring infrared emissions from the Moon and radiation conditions of the lunar environment. Gravitational studies were also conducted.

==The flight==
Luna 10 launched towards the Moon on 31 March 1966 at 10:48 GMT.

After a midcourse correction on 1 April, the spacecraft entered lunar orbit on 3 April 1966 and completed its first orbit 3 hours later (on 4 April Moscow time). A 245-kilogram instrument compartment separated from the main bus, which was in a 218 x 621 mile orbit inclined at 71.9° to the lunar equator. 

Luna 10 operated for 460 lunar orbits and performed 219 active data transmissions before radio signals were discontinued on 30 May 1966. The spacecraft eventually crashed on the moon on an unknown date.

==The Internationale==
The spacecraft carried a set of solid-state oscillators that had been programmed to reproduce the notes of &quot;The Internationale&quot;, so that it could be broadcast live to the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. During a rehearsal on the night of 3 April, the playback went well, but the following morning, controllers discovered a missing note and played the previous night&#x27;s tape to the assembled gathering at the Congress — claiming it was a live broadcast from the Moon.

<text>Luna 11 (E-6LF series) was an uncrewed space mission of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Luna program. It was also called Lunik 11. Luna 11 was launched towards the Moon onboard a Molniya-M and entered lunar orbit on 27 August 1966.

== Overview ==
The objectives of the mission included the study of:
* lunar gamma and X-ray emissions in order to determine the Moon&#x27;s chemical composition;
* lunar gravitational anomalies;
* the concentration of meteorite streams near the Moon;
* the intensity of hard corpuscular radiation near the Moon.

137 radio transmissions and 277 orbits of the Moon were completed before the batteries failed on 1 October 1966.

This subset of the &quot;second-generation&quot; Luna spacecraft, the E-6LF, was designed to take the first photographs of the surface of the Moon from lunar orbit. A secondary objective was to obtain data on mass concentrations (&quot;mascons&quot;) on the Moon first detected by Luna 10. Using the Ye-6 bus, a suite of scientific instruments (plus an imaging system similar to the one used on Zond 3) replaced the small lander capsule used on the soft-landing flights. The resolution of the photos was 15 to 20 meters. To reduce problems caused by damage to the film due to solar radiation it was planned to take all photos within the first 24 hours of lunar orbits. A technological experiment included testing the efficiency of gear transmission in a vacuum as a test for a future lunar rover.

Luna 11, launched only two weeks after the U.S. Lunar Orbiter, entered lunar orbit at 21:49 GMT on 27 August 1966. Parameters were 99 x 742 miles. During the mission, the TV camera failed to return usable images because the spacecraft lost proper orientation to face the lunar surface when a foreign object was lodged in the nozzle of one of the attitude-control thrusters. The other instruments functioned without fault before the mission formally ended on 1 October 1966 after the power supply had been depleted. The spacecraft eventually crashed on the moon on an unknown date.

<text>Luna 12 (E-6LF series) was an uncrewed space mission of the Luna program, also called Lunik 12.

==Overview==
Luna 12 was launched towards the Moon onboard a Molniya-M and achieved lunar orbit on October 25, 1966. The spacecraft was equipped with a television system that obtained and transmitted photographs of the lunar surface. The photographs contained 1100 scan lines with a maximum resolution of 14.9-19.8 m. Pictures of the lunar surface were returned on October 27, 1966. The number of photographs is not known. Radio transmissions from Luna 12 ceased on January 19, 1967, after 602 lunar orbits and 302 radio transmissions.

Luna 12 was launched to complete the mission that Luna 11 had failed to accomplish—take high-resolution photos of the Moon&#x27;s surface from lunar orbit. Luna 12 reached the Moon on October 25, 1966, and entered a 133 x 1,200-kilometer orbit. The Soviet press released the first photos taken of the surface on October 29—pictures that showed the Sea of Rains and the Aristarchus crater. Resolution was as high as 15 to 20 meters. Film was developed, fixed, dried automatically, and scanned for transmission to Earth. No further photos were ever released. After completing its main imaging mission, Luna 12 was put into a spin-stabilized roll to carry out its scientific mission, which was successfully fulfilled.

Luna 12 was the first soviet probe where deliberate steps were taken to prevent interception of its signals by Jodrell Bank Observatory. When the probe was in the field of view of the observatory it began switch its signals between two different frequencies, something Jodrell Bank was not able to follow.

==Legacy and status==
On January 21, 1967, the Soviet news agency TASS announced that Luna 12 had completed its mission, breaking contact with ground stations.

<text>Luna 13 (E-6M series) was an uncrewed space mission of the Luna program by Soviet Union.

==Overview==
The Luna 13 spacecraft was launched toward the Moon onboard a Molniya-M and accomplished a soft landing on 24 December 1966, in the region of Oceanus Procellarum (&quot;Ocean of Storms&quot;).

The petal encasement of the spacecraft was opened, antennas were erected, and radio transmissions to Earth began four minutes after the landing. On 25 and 26 December 1966, the spacecraft television system transmitted panoramas of the nearby lunar landscape at different Sun angles. Each panorama required approximately 100 minutes to transmit. The spacecraft was equipped with a mechanical soil-measuring penetrometer, a dynamograph, and a radiation densitometer for obtaining data on the mechanical and physical properties and the cosmic ray reflectivity of the lunar surface. Transmissions from the spacecraft ceased on 28 December 1966.

Luna 13 became the third spacecraft to land successfully on the surface of the Moon (after Luna 9 and the American Surveyor 1). The probe landed in the Ocean of Storms at 18:01 UT on 24 December 1966, between the Krafft and Seleucus craters at 18°52&#x27; north latitude and 62°3&#x27; west longitude. Unlike its predecessor, the heavier Luna 13 lander (113 kilograms) carried a suite of scientific instruments in addition to the usual imaging system.

A three-axis accelerometer within the pressurized frame of the lander recorded the landing forces during impact to determine the soil structure down to a depth of . A pair of spring-loaded booms were also deployed. One of these booms carried a penetrometer, designed to measure the forces required to penetrate the lunar regolith – the penetrating force being supplied by a minute explosive charge. The other boom carried a backscatter densitometer that was used to infer the density of the lunar near-surface regolith. Four radiometers recorded infrared radiation from the surface indicating a noon temperature of 117 ±3 °C while a radiation detector indicated that radiation levels would be less than hazardous for humans.

The lander returned a total of five panoramas of the lunar surface, showing a more smooth terrain than seen by Luna 9. One of the two cameras (intended to return stereo images) failed, but this did not diminish the quality of the photographs. The penetrometer measured the regolith density at 800 kg/m3.

After a fully successful mission, contact was lost at 06:13 UTC on 28th of December when the on-board batteries were exhausted.

<text>Luna 14 (E-6LS series) was an uncrewed space mission of the Luna program run by the Soviet Union. It was also called Lunik 14.

==Overview==
The spacecraft is believed to have been similar to Luna 12 and the instrumentation was similar to that carried by Luna 10. It provided data for studies of the interaction of the Earth and lunar masses, the lunar gravitational field, the propagation and stability of radio communications to the spacecraft at different orbital positions, solar charged particles and cosmic rays, and the motion of the Moon. This flight was the final flight of the second generation of the Luna series.

Luna 14 successfully entered lunar orbit at 19:25 UT on 10 April 1968. Initial orbital parameters were 160 × 870 kilometers at 42° inclination. The primary goal of the flight was to test communications systems in support of the N1-L3 piloted lunar landing project. Ground tracking of the spacecraft&#x27;s orbit also allowed controllers to accurately map lunar gravitational anomalies in order to predict trajectories of future lunar missions such as those of the LOK and LK lunar landing vehicles. Luna 14 also carried scientific instruments to study cosmic rays and charged particles from the Sun, although few details have been revealed. The mission lasted 75 days.

<text>Argyria or argyrosis is a condition caused by excessive exposure to chemical compounds of the element silver, or silver dust. The most dramatic symptom of argyria is that the skin turns blue or blue-gray, and is usually most prominent in sun-exposed areas of the skin. It may take the form of &quot;generalized argyria&quot; or &quot;local argyria&quot;. Generalized argyria affects large areas over much of the visible surface of the body. Local argyria shows in limited regions of the body, such as patches of skin, parts of the mucous membrane, or the conjunctiva.

The terms &quot;argyria&quot; and &quot;argyrosis&quot; have long been used interchangeably, with &quot;argyria&quot; being used more frequently. &quot;Argyrosis&quot; has been used particularly in referring to argyria of the conjunctiva, but the usage has never been consistent and cannot be relied on except where it has been explicitly specified. The term is from the (, &#x27;silver&#x27;).

==Pathophysiology==

In humans and other animals, chronic intake of silver products commonly leads to the gradual accumulation of silver compounds in various parts of the body. As in analog photography (where silver is used for its sensitivity to light), exposure of pale or colorless silver compounds to sunlight decomposes them to silver metal or silver sulfides. Commonly these products deposit as microscopic particles in the skin, in effect a dark pigment. This condition is known as argyria or argyrosis.

Chronic intake also may lead to silver pigments depositing in other organs exposed to light, particularly the eyes. In the conjunctiva this is not generally harmful, but it also may affect the lens, leading to serious effects.

Localized argyria often results from topical use of substances containing silver, such as some kinds of eye drops. Generalized argyria results from chronically swallowing or inhaling silver compounds, either for home medicinal purposes or as a result of working with silver or silver compounds.

While silver is potentially toxic to humans at high doses, the risk of serious harm from low doses, given over a short term, is small. Silver is used in some medical appliances because of its anti-microbial nature, which stems from the oligodynamic effect. Chronic ingestion or inhalation of silver preparations (especially colloidal silver) can lead to argyria in the skin and other organs. This is not life-threatening but is considered by most to be cosmetically undesirable.

The reference dose, published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1991, which represents the estimated daily exposure that is unlikely to incur an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime, is 5 μg/(kg·d).

Argyria worsens and builds up as exposure to silver continues, and does not resolve once exposure stops because the silver atoms cannot be removed from the skin and other tissues.

== History ==
Since at least the mid-19th century, doctors have known that silver or silver compounds can cause some areas of the skin and other body tissues to turn grey or blue-gray. Argyria occurs in people who ingest or inhale silver in large quantities over a long period (several months to many years). People who work in factories that manufacture silver products can also breathe in silver or its compounds. In the past, some of these workers have become argyric. However, the level of silver in the air and the length of exposure that caused argyria in these workers is not known. Historically, colloidal silver, a liquid suspension of microscopic silver particles, was also used as an internal medication to treat a variety of diseases. In the 1940s, they were overtaken by the use of pharmaceutical antibiotics, such as penicillin.

==Society and culture==

A prominent case involving the ingestion of colloidal silver was that of American Stan Jones, a Libertarian candidate for the United States Senate in 2002 and 2006. The peculiar coloration of his skin was featured prominently in media coverage of his unsuccessful campaign, though his supporters contended that the best-known photo was &quot;doctored&quot;. Jones promised that he was not using his silvery complexion as a gimmick. His purposeful consumption of colloidal silver was a self-prescribed measure undertaken in response to fears that the Y2K problem would make antibiotics unavailable, an event that did not occur. He is reported to have said that given the chance to go back, he would do it again. He maintains that his good health, excepting the unusual skin tone, is the result of his use of colloidal silver.

In 2007, press reports described Paul Karason, an American man whose skin gradually turned blue after he took a homemade silver chloride colloid and used a silver salve on his face in an attempt to treat problems with his sinuses, dermatitis, acid reflux and other issues. At the time of the reports, Karason maintained his belief in silver&#x27;s effectiveness and continued to take it, albeit in smaller doses. He died in 2013 of a heart attack; &quot;a cause of death was not immediately known&quot;, but according to Jo Anna Karason, his estranged wife, &quot;Paul Karason had suffered heart problems for years. He was a heavy smoker, despite undergoing triple bypass surgery about five years ago&quot;.

Rosemary Jacobs is a prominent activist against alternative medicine. As a child, Jacobs was treated for allergies with nose drops that contained colloidal silver and developed argyria as a result. Jacobs came to international attention after Paul Karason was on &quot;The Today Show&quot; in 2008. From 2010 to 2013, Jacobs posted about topics in health fraud, particularly naturopathy, on her blog.

==Possible implications==
Although research is still not definitive, the literature has suggested that argyria can cause a decrement in kidney function. Additionally, a lack of night vision may be present.

<text>Luna 15 was a robotic space mission of the Soviet Luna programme, that was in lunar orbit together with the Apollo 11 Command module &quot;Columbia&quot;.

On 21 July 1969, while Apollo 11 astronauts finished the first human moonwalk, Luna 15, a robotic Soviet spacecraft in lunar orbit at the time, began its descent to the lunar surface. Launched three days before the Apollo 11 mission, it was the second Soviet attempt to bring lunar soil back to Earth with a goal to outstrip the US in achieving a sample return in the Moon race. The previous mission, designated E-8-5-402, launched 14 June 1969, did not achieve Earth orbit because the third stage of its launch vehicle failed to ignite. The Luna 15 lander crashed into the Moon at 15:50 UT, hours before the scheduled American lift off from the Moon.

==Mission==
Luna 15 was capable of studying circumlunar space, the lunar gravitational field, and the chemical composition of lunar rocks. It was also capable of providing lunar surface photography. Luna 15 was placed in an intermediate Earth orbit after launch and was then sent toward the Moon. After a mid-course correction the day after launch, Luna 15 entered lunar orbit at 10:00 UT on 17 July 1969. The spacecraft remained in lunar orbit for two days while controllers checked all on-board systems and performed two orbital manoeuvres.

After completing 86 communications sessions and 52 orbits of the Moon at various inclinations and altitudes, it began its descent. Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had already set foot on the Moon when Luna 15 fired its main retrorocket engine to initiate descent to the surface at 15:47 UT on 21 July 1969. Transmissions ceased four minutes after de-orbit, at a calculated altitude of . The spacecraft had probably crashed into the side of a mountain. 

Impact coordinates were 17° north latitude and 60° east longitude, in Mare Crisium. Luna&#x27;s impact site is some north-northeast of the Apollo 11 landing site, on a bearing of 328 degrees. An audio recording of the minutes in which British technicians at the radio telescope facility in Jodrell Bank observed Luna 15&#x27;s descent was first made available to the public on 3 July 2009.

==Implications==
The simultaneous missions became one of the first instances of Soviet–American space communication: the Soviet Union released Luna 15&#x27;s flight plan to ensure it would not collide with Apollo 11, although its exact mission was not publicized.

In a race to reach the Moon and return to Earth, the parallel missions of Luna 15 and Apollo 11 represented, in many ways, the culmination of the Space Race between the space programs of the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1960s.

<text>Luna 16 was an uncrewed 1970 space mission, part of the Soviet Luna program. It was the first robotic probe to land on the Moon and return a sample of lunar soil to Earth. The 101 grams (3.56 ounces) sample was returned from Mare Fecunditatis. It represented the first successful lunar sample return mission by the Soviet Union and was the third lunar sample return mission overall.

==Overview==

The spacecraft consisted of two attached stages, an ascent stage mounted on top of a descent stage. The descent stage was a cylindrical body with four protruding landing legs, fuel tanks, a landing radar, and a dual descent-engine complex.

A main descent engine was used to slow the craft until it reached a cutoff point, which was determined by the on-board computer based on altitude and velocity. After cutoff a bank of lower-thrust jets was used for the final landing. The descent stage also acted as a launch pad for the ascent stage.

The ascent stage was a smaller cylinder with a rounded top. It carried a cylindrical hermetically sealed soil-sample container inside a re-entry capsule.

The spacecraft descent stage was equipped with a television camera, radiation and temperature monitors, telecommunications equipment, and an extendable arm with a drilling rig for the collection of a lunar soil sample.

==Mission summary==
The &quot;Luna 16&quot; automated station was launched toward the Moon from a preliminary Earth orbit and after one mid-course correction on 13 September it entered a circular 111 km with 70° inclination lunar orbit on 17 September 1970.
The lunar gravity was studied from this orbit. After two orbital adjustments were performed on 18 and 19 September the perilune was decreased to 15.1 km, as well as the inclination altered in preparation for landing. At perilune at 05:12 UTC on 20 September, the main braking engine was fired, initiating the descent to the lunar surface. Six minutes later, at 05:18 UT, the spacecraft safely soft-landed in its target area at 0°41&#x27; south latitude and 56°18&#x27; east longitude, in the northeast area of Mare Fecunditatis (Sea of Fertility) approximately 100 kilometers west of Webb crater and 150 km north of Langrenus crater. 

This was the first landing made in lunar night, as the Sun had set about 60 hours earlier. The main descent engine cut off at an altitude of 20 m, and the landing jets cut off at 2 m height at a velocity less than 2.4 m/s, followed by vertical free fall. The mass of the spacecraft at landing was 1,880 kilograms. Less than an hour after landing, at 06:03 UT, an automatic drill penetrated the lunar surface to collect a soil sample. After drilling for seven minutes, the drill reached a stop at 35 centimeters depth and then withdrew its sample and lifted it in an arc to the top of the spacecraft, depositing the lunar material in a small spherical capsule mounted on the main spacecraft bus. The column of regolith in the drill tube was then transferred to the soil sample container.

After 26 hours and 25 minutes on the lunar surface, at 07:43 UT on 21 September, the spacecraft&#x27;s upper stage lifted off from the Moon. The lower stage of &quot;Luna 16&quot; remained on the lunar surface and continued transmission of lunar temperature and radiation data. Three days later, on 24 September, after a direct ascent traverse with no mid-course corrections, the capsule, with its 101 grams of lunar soil, reentered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at a velocity of 11 kilometers per second. The capsule parachuted down 80 kilometers southeast of the town of Jezkazgan in Kazakhstan at 05:25 UT on 24 September 1970. Analysis of the dark basalt material indicated a close resemblance to soil recovered by the American Apollo 12 mission.

According to the Bochum Observatory in Germany, strong and good-quality television pictures were returned by the spacecraft. &quot;Luna 16&quot; was a landmark success for the Soviets in their deep-space exploration program; the mission accomplished the first fully automatic recovery of soil samples from the surface of an extraterrestrial body.

A 0.4825 g sample of material from a depth of 27 cm was sent to Britain.

==Legacy==
Three tiny samples (0.2 grams) of the &quot;Luna 16&quot; soil were sold at Sotheby&#x27;s auction for $442,500 in 1993. The samples were resold by Sotheby&#x27;s for US$855,000 on 29 November 2018.

A series of 10-kopeck stamps was issued in 1970 to commemorate the flight of &quot;Luna 16&quot; lunar probe and depicted the main stages of the programme: soft landing on Moon, launch of the lunar soil sample return capsule, and parachute assisted landing back on Earth.

Replicas of Luna 16 are on display at the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics and Tsiolkovsky State Museum of the History of Cosmonautics.

<text>Luna 17 (Ye-8 series) was an uncrewed space mission of the Luna program, also called Lunik 17. It deployed the first robotic rover onto the surface of the Moon.

== Launch ==

&quot;Luna 17&quot; was launched from an Earth parking orbit towards the Moon and entered lunar orbit on 15 November 1970. The spacecraft softly landed on the Moon in the Mare Imbrium (Sea of Rains). The spacecraft had dual ramps by which the payload, &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot;, descended to the lunar surface. 

&quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; was a lunar vehicle formed of a tub-like compartment with a large convex lid on eight independently powered wheels. &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; was equipped with a cone-shaped antenna, a highly directional helical antenna, four teleray spectrometer, an x-ray telescope, cosmic-ray detectors, and a laser retro-reflector (supplied by France) was also included. The vehicle was powered by a solar cell array mounted on the underside of the lid. 

&quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; was intended to operate through three lunar days but actually operated for eleven lunar days (eleven Earth months). The operations of Lunokhod officially ceased on 4 October 1971, the anniversary of Sputnik 1, after having traveled over while taking pictures and performing numerous tests.

&quot;Luna 17&quot; continued the spate of successes in Soviet lunar exploration begun by &quot;Luna 16&quot; and Zond 8. &quot;Luna 17&quot; carried &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot;, the first in a series of robot lunar roving vehicles whose conception had begun in the early 1960s, originally as part of the piloted lunar landing operations. This was the second attempt to land such a vehicle on the Moon after a failure in February 1969. 

The descent stage was equipped with two landing ramps for the rover, to disembark onto the Moon&#x27;s surface. 

The rover stood about high and was across. Each of its eight wheels could be controlled independently for two forward and two reverse speeds. Its top speed was about , with commands issued by a five-man team of &quot;drivers&quot; on Earth who had to deal with the 5-second delay. The set of scientific instruments was powered by solar cells (installed on the inside of the hinged top lid of the rover) and chemical batteries.

After two mid-course corrections en route to the Moon, &quot;Luna 17&quot; entered lunar orbit and then landed on the lunar surface at 03:46:50 UT on 17 November 1970 at 38°17&#x27; north latitude and 35° west longitude, about from the Luna 16 site in the Sea of Rains. 

The Lunokhod 1 rover rolled over the ramps and onto the lunar surface at 06:28 UT. During its 322 Earth days of operation, the rover traveled and returned more than 20,000 TV images and 206 high-resolution panoramas. 

In addition, &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; performed twenty-five soil analyses with its RIFMA X-ray fluorescence spectrometer and used its penetrometer at 500 different locations. 

Controllers finished the last communications session with &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; at 13:05 UT on 14 September 1971. Attempts to reestablish contact were finally discontinued on 4 October.

In March 2010, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter photographed the landing site of &quot;Luna 17&quot;, showing the lander and tracks of the rover. In April 2010, the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation team announced that with the aid of these photos, they had found the long-lost &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; rover and had received returns from the laser retroreflector.

<text>Luna 18, part of the Ye-8-5 series, was an uncrewed space mission of the Luna program.

==Overview==
&quot;Luna 18&quot; was placed in an Earth parking orbit after it was launched and was then sent towards the Moon. On 7 September 1971, it entered lunar orbit. The spacecraft completed 85 communications sessions and 54 lunar orbits before it was sent towards the lunar surface by use of braking rockets. It impacted the Moon on 11 September 1971, at 3 degrees 34 minutes N, 56 degrees 30 minutes E (selenographic coordinates) in rugged mountainous terrain. Signals ceased at the moment of impact.

This mission was the seventh Soviet attempt to recover soil samples from the surface of the Moon and the first after the success of &quot;Luna 16&quot;. After two mid-course corrections on 4 September and 6 September 1971, &quot;Luna 18&quot; entered a circular orbit around the Moon on 7 September at 100 kilometers altitude with an inclination of 35°. After several more orbital corrections, on 11 September, the vehicle began its descent to the lunar surface. Contact with the spacecraft was lost at 07:48 UT at the previously determined point of lunar landing. Impact coordinates were 3°34&#x27; north latitude and 56°30&#x27; east longitude, near the edge of the Mare Fecunditatis (&quot;Sea of Fertility&quot;). Officially, the Soviets announced that &quot;the lunar landing in the complex mountainous conditions proved to be unfavorable.&quot; Later, in 1975, the Soviets published data from &quot;Luna 18&quot;″s continuous-wave radio altimeter that determined the mean density of the lunar topsoil.

<text>Luna 19 (a.k.a. Lunik 19) (E-8-LS series), was an uncrewed space mission of the Luna program. &quot;Luna 19&quot; extended the systematic study of lunar gravitational fields and location of mascons (mass concentrations). It also studied the lunar radiation environment, the gamma-active lunar surface, and the solar wind. Photographic coverage via a television system was also obtained.

==Overview==
&quot;Luna 19&quot; was the first of the “advanced” lunar orbiters whose design was based upon
the same Ye-8-class bus used for the lunar rovers and the sample collectors. For these orbiters, designated Ye-8LS, the basic “lander stage” was topped off by a wheelless Lunokhod-like frame that housed all scientific instrumentation in a pressurized container.

&quot;Luna 19&quot; was launched into an Earth parking orbit on 28 September, of the year 1971 and, from this orbit, was sent toward the Moon. &quot;Luna 19&quot; entered an orbit around the Moon on 2 October 1971 after two midcourse corrections on 29 September and 1 October. Initial orbital parameters were 140 x 140 kilometers at 40.58° inclination.

Soon afterward, the spacecraft began its main imaging mission — providing panoramic images of the mountainous region of the Moon between 30° and 60° south latitude and between 20° and 80° east longitude. Other scientific experiments included extensive studies on the shape and strength of the lunar gravitational field and the locations of the mascons. Occultation experiments in May and June 1972 allowed scientists to determine the concentration of charged particles at an altitude of 10 kilometers. Additional studies of the solar wind were evidently coordinated with those performed by the Mars 2 and 3 orbiters and Veneras 7 and 8. Communications with Luna 19 was lost on 1 November 1972, after a year of operation and more than 4,000 orbits around the Moon.

<text>Luna 20 was the second of three successful Soviet lunar sample return missions. It was flown as part of the Luna program as a robotic competitor to the six successful Apollo lunar sample return missions.

&quot;Luna 20&quot; was placed in an intermediate Earth parking orbit and from this orbit was sent towards the Moon. It entered lunar orbit on 18 February 1972. On 21 February 1972, &quot;Luna 20&quot; soft landed on the Moon in a mountainous area known as the Terra Apollonius (or Apollonius highlands) near Mare Fecunditatis (Sea of Fertility), 120 km from where &quot;Luna 16&quot; had landed. 

While on the lunar surface, the panoramic television system was operated. Lunar samples were obtained by means of an extendable drilling apparatus. The ascent stage of &quot;Luna 20&quot; was launched from the lunar surface on 22 February 1972 carrying 1.9 ounces (55 grams) of collected lunar samples in a sealed capsule. It landed in the Soviet Union on 25 February 1972. The lunar samples were recovered the following day.

==Overview==

This was the eighth Soviet spacecraft launched with the intent of returning lunar soil to Earth. It was evidently sent to complete the mission that Luna 18 had failed to accomplish. After a 4.5-day flight to the Moon, which included a single midcourse correction on 15 February, &quot;Luna 20&quot; entered orbit around the Moon on 18 February. Initial orbital parameters were 100 x 100 kilometers at 65° inclination.

Three days later, at 19:13 UT, the spacecraft fired its main engine for 267 seconds to begin descent to the lunar surface. A second firing further reduced velocity before Luna 20 set down safely on the Moon at 19:19 UT on 21 February 1972 at coordinates 3.7863 North and 56.6242 East, only 1.8 kilometers from the crash site of Luna 18.

After collecting a small sample of lunar soil, the spacecraft&#x27;s ascent stage lifted off at 22:58 UT on 22 February and quickly accelerated to 2.7 kilometers per second velocity—sufficient to return to Earth. The small spherical capsule eventually parachuted down safely on an island in the Karkingir River, 40 kilometers north of the town of Jezkazgan in Kazakhstan, at 19:19 UT on 25 February 1972.

The 30-gram soil sample differed from that collected by &quot;Luna 16&quot; in that the majority (50 to 60%) of the rock particles in the newer sample were ancient lunar highlands anorthosite (which consists largely of feldspar) rather than the basalt of the earlier one (which contained about 1 to 2% of anorthosite). The American Apollo 16 mission returned similar highlands material two months later.

Like the &quot;Luna 16&quot; soil, samples of the &quot;Luna 20&quot; collection were shared with American and French scientists. A 0.4983g sample of material from a depth of 27 and 32 cm was sent to Britain.

In March 2010, NASA reported that its Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter satellite had spotted &quot;Luna 20&quot; on the lunar surface.

<text>Luna 21 (Ye-8 series) was an uncrewed space mission, and its spacecraft, of the Luna program, also called Lunik 21, in 1973. The spacecraft landed on the Moon and deployed the second Soviet lunar rover, &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot;. The primary objectives of the mission were to collect images of the lunar surface, examine ambient light levels to determine the feasibility of astronomical observations from the Moon, perform laser ranging experiments from Earth, observe solar X-rays, measure local magnetic fields, and study mechanical properties of the lunar surface material.

== Mission ==

&quot;Luna 21&quot; carried the second successful Soviet lunar rover, &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot;, and was launched less than a month after the last Apollo lunar landing. The Proton-K/D launcher put the spacecraft into Earth parking orbit followed by translunar injection. On 12 January 1973, &quot;Luna 21&quot; was braked into a 90 × 100 km orbit about the Moon, at a 60° inclination. On 13 and 14 January, the perilune was lowered to 16 km altitude. On 15 January after 40 orbits, the braking rocket was fired at 16 km altitude, and the craft went into free fall. At an altitude of 750 meters the main thrusters began firing, slowing the fall until a height of 22 meters was reached. At this point the main thrusters shut down and the secondary thrusters ignited, slowing the fall until the lander was 1.5 meters above the surface, where the engine was cut off. Landing occurred at 23:35 UT in Le Monnier crater at 25.85° N, 30.45° E, between Mare Serenitatis (&quot;Sea of Serenity&quot;) and the Taurus Mountains. The lander carried a bas-relief of Vladimir Lenin and the Soviet coat-of-arms.

Less than three hours later, at 01:14 UT on 16 January, the rover disembarked onto the lunar surface. The 840 kilogram &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; was an improved version of its predecessor and was equipped with a third TV camera, an improved eight-wheel traction system, and additional scientific instrumentation. By the end of its first lunar day, &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; had already traveled further than &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; in its entire operational life. On 9 May, the rover inadvertently rolled into a crater and dust covered its solar panels and radiators, disrupting temperatures in the vehicle. Attempts to save the rover failed, and on 3 June, the Soviet news agency announced that its mission was over. Before last contact, the rover took 80,000 TV pictures and 86 panoramic photos and had performed hundreds of mechanical and chemical surveys of the soil. The Soviets later revealed that during a conference on planetary exploration in Moscow, 29 January to 2 February 1973 (that is, after the landing of &quot;Luna 21&quot;), an American scientist had given photos of the lunar surface around the &quot;Luna 21&quot; landing site to a Soviet engineer in charge of the &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; mission. These photos, taken prior to the Apollo 17 landing, were later used by the &quot;driver team&quot; to navigate the new rover on its mission on the Moon
*Launch Date/Time: 1973-01-08 at 06:55:38 UTC

<text>Luna 22 (Ye-8-LS series) was an uncrewed space mission, part of the Soviet Luna program, also called Lunik 22.

==Overview==

&quot;Luna 22&quot; was a lunar orbiter mission. The spacecraft carried imaging cameras and also had the objectives of studying the Moon&#x27;s magnetic field, surface gamma ray emissions and composition of lunar surface rocks, and the gravitational field, as well as micrometeorites and cosmic rays. Luna 22 was launched into Earth parking orbit and then to the Moon. It was inserted into a circular lunar orbit on 2 June 1974. The spacecraft made many orbit adjustments over its 18-month lifetime in order to optimize the operation of various experiments, lowering the perilune to as little as 25 km. 

&quot;Luna 22&quot; was the second of two &quot;advanced&quot; lunar orbiters, the first of which being &quot;Luna 19 . The orbiter was&quot; designed to conduct extensive scientific surveys from orbit. Well in route to the Moon, &quot;Luna 20&quot; had to perform a single mid-course correction on 30 May, and entered lunar orbit on 2 June 1974. When the orbiter first entered orbit of the Moon, it started at periapsis altitude at and apoapsis altitude as , and an inclination of 19°35&#x27;, these orbital parameters changed throughout its mission. Throughout the orbiters various orbital changes, Luna 22 had performed without any problems, and it continued to return photos fifteen months into its mission, past the conclusion of its primary mission, which had ended by 2 April 1975. The maneuvering propellant on the spacecraft was depleted on 2 September 1975, and the mission was formally concluded in early November 1975, following a highly successful mission.

<text>Luna 23 was an uncrewed space mission of the Luna program developed by the Soviet Union.

==Overview==
&quot;Luna 23&quot; was a Soviet Moon lander mission which was intended to return a lunar sample to Earth. Launched to the Moon by a Proton-K/D, the spacecraft tipped over on its side and was damaged upon landing in Mare Crisium. The sample collecting apparatus could not operate and no samples were returned. The lander continued transmissions for three days after landing. In 1976, &quot;Luna 24&quot; landed several hundred meters away and successfully returned samples. The asteroid-like object 2010 KQ is believed to be a rocket that parted the &quot;Luna 23&quot; module after launch.

&quot;Luna 23&quot; was the first modified lunar sample return spacecraft, designed to return a deep core sample of the Moon&#x27;s surface (hence the change in index from Ye-8-5 to Ye-8-5M). While &quot;Luna 16&quot; and &quot;Luna 20&quot; had returned samples from a depth of 0.3 meters, the new spacecraft was designed to dig to 2.5 meters. After a midcourse correction on 31 October, &quot;Luna 23&quot; entered orbit around the Moon on 2 November 1974. Parameters were 104 × 94 kilometers at 138° inclination. Following several more changes to the orbit, the spacecraft descended to the lunar surface on 6 November and landed in the southernmost portion of Mare Crisium. Landing coordinates were 13° north latitude and 62° east longitude. During landing in &quot;unfavorable&quot; terrain, the lander&#x27;s drilling device was evidently damaged, preventing fulfillment of the primary mission, the return of lunar soil to Earth. Scientists devised a makeshift plan to conduct a limited science exploration program with the stationary lander. Controllers maintained contact with the spacecraft until 9 November 1974.

High resolution orbital photographs taken by the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and released in March 2012 showed the &quot;Luna 23&quot; spacecraft lying on its side on the lunar surface. The spacecraft evidently tipped over upon landing, perhaps due to higher than nominal vertical and/or horizontal velocities at touchdown.

==In culture==
In the 2007 BioWare video game &quot;Mass Effect&quot;, derelict remains of this spacecraft can be found in the accessible parts of Earth&#x27;s Moon and can be salvaged for random materials.

<text>Luna 24 was a robotic probe of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Luna programme. The 24th mission of the Luna series of spacecraft, the mission of the &quot;Luna 24&quot; probe was the third Soviet mission to return lunar soil samples from the Moon (the first two sample return missions were &quot;Luna 16&quot; and &quot;Luna 20&quot;). The probe landed in Mare Crisium (Sea of Crises). The mission returned of lunar samples to the Earth on 22 August 1976.

== Spacecraft ==

Luna 24 was based on the Ye-8-5 spacecraft body, consisting of two attached stages, an ascent stage mounted on top of a descent stage. The lander stood 3.96 meters tall and had an unfueled landed mass of 1880 kg. With a full load of fuel its launch mass was between 5600 and 5750 kg.

The descent stage was the same as the Ye-8 lower stage for the Lunokhod rovers, a cylindrical body with four protruding landing legs, fuel tanks, a landing radar altimeter, and a dual descent engine complex. The main descent rocket, the KTDU-417, was a throttleable 1920 kg thrust engine used for mid-course corrections, orbit insertion, braking for descent to the surface, and to slow the craft until it reached a cutoff point which was determined by the onboard computer based on altitude and velocity. After cutoff a bank of lower thrust (210 and 350 kg) vernier jets was used for the final landing. The descent stage also acted as a launch pad for the ascent stage. The spacecraft descent stage was equipped with a television camera, radiation and temperature monitors, telecommunications equipment, and a 90 cm extendable arm with a drilling rig for the collection of a lunar soil sample. Communications were via a conical antenna at the end of a boom at 768 and 922 MHz (downlink) and 115 MHz (uplink).

The ascent stage was a smaller cylinder with a spherical top which replaced the Lunokhod rover and housing from the Ye-8 bus. It carried a cylindrical hermetically sealed soil sample container inside a spherical re-entry capsule, mounted on a 1920 kg thrust KRD-61 rocket. Total mass of the ascent stage was 520 kg, of which 245 kg was the nitric acid and UDMH propellant. It was 2 meters tall. The sample return cabin was 50 cm in diameter and had a mass of 39 kg. The KRD-61 could only fire once, for 53 seconds, to put it on a free return trajectory to Earth. Specific impulse of the engine was 313 seconds, it could impart a velocity of 2600–2700 m/s to the return craft.

== Mission ==
&quot;Luna 24&quot; was the third attempt to recover a sample from the unexplored Mare Crisium, the location of a large lunar mascon (after &quot;Luna 23&quot; and a launch failure in October 1975). After a trajectory correction on 11 August 1976, &quot;Luna 24&quot; entered lunar orbit three days later. Initial orbital parameters were at 120° inclination. After further changes to its orbit, &quot;Luna 24&quot; set down safely on the lunar surface at 06:36 UTC on 18 August 1976 at 12°45&#x27; North latitude and 62°12&#x27; East longitude, not far from where &quot;Luna 23&quot; had landed. Exact landing location (12.7145° N, 62.2097° E) was determined by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter probe orbital cameras in 2012. The crater adjacent to the lander was subsequently named &quot;Lev&quot; by the IAU.

Under command from ground control, the lander deployed its sample arm and pushed its drilling head about two metres into the nearby soil. The sample was safely stowed in the small return capsule, and after nearly a day on the Moon, &quot;Luna 24&quot; lifted off successfully at 05:25 UTC on 19 August 1976. After an uneventful return trip, &quot;Luna 24&quot;″s capsule entered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and parachuted safely to land at 05:55 UTC on 22 August 1976, about southeast of Surgut in western Siberia. Study of the recovered of soil indicated a laminated type structure, as if laid down in successive deposits. The Soviet Union swapped a gram of the mission sample for a lunar sample from NASA in December 1976. &quot;Luna 24&quot; was the final lunar spacecraft to be launched by the Soviet Union. It was also the last spacecraft to make a soft landing on the Moon until the landing of China&#x27;s &quot;Chang&#x27;e 3&quot; on 14 December 2013, 37 years later. For over 40 years, it was also the last Lunar sample return mission until China&#x27;s Chang&#x27;e 5 in December 2020.

== Detection of water in returned samples ==
In February 1978, Soviet scientists M. Akhmanova, B. Dement&#x27;ev, and M. Markov of the Vernadsky Institute of Geochemistry and Analytic Chemistry published a paper claiming a detection of water fairly definitively. Their study showed that the samples returned to Earth by the probe contained about 0.1% water by mass, as seen in infrared absorption spectroscopy (at about 3 μm wavelength), at a detection level about 10 times above the threshold, although Crotts points out that &quot;The authors... were not willing to stake their reputations on an absolute statement that terrestrial contamination was completely avoided.&quot; This would represent the first detection of water content on the surface of the moon, although that result has not been confirmed by other researchers.

<text>The Reverend is an honorific style given before the names of certain Christian clergy and ministers. There are sometimes differences in the way the style is used in different countries and church traditions. &quot;The Reverend&quot; is correctly called a &quot;style&quot;, but is sometimes referred to as a title, form of address, or title of respect.

The term is an anglicisation of the Latin , the style originally used in Latin documents in medieval Europe. It is the gerundive or future passive participle of the verb (&quot;to respect; to revere&quot;), meaning &quot;[one who is] to be revered/must be respected&quot;. &quot;The Reverend&quot; is therefore equivalent to &quot;the Honourable&quot; or &quot;the Venerable&quot;. Originating as a general term of respectful address in the 15th century, it became particularly associated with clergy by the 17th century, with variations associated with certain ranks in the church. It is paired with a modifier or noun for some offices in some religious traditions: Lutheran archbishops, Anglican archbishops, and most Catholic bishops are usually styled &quot;The Most Reverend&quot; (); other Lutheran bishops, Anglican bishops, and Catholic bishops are styled &quot;The Right Reverend&quot;.

The forms &quot;His Reverence&quot; and &quot;Her Reverence&quot; are also sometimes used, along with their parallel in direct address, &quot;Your Reverence&quot;.

== Usage ==
In traditional and formal English usage it is still considered incorrect to drop the definite article, &quot;the&quot;, before &quot;Reverend&quot;. In practice, however, &quot;the&quot; is often not used in both written and spoken English. When the style is used within a sentence, &quot;the&quot; is correctly in lower-case. Abbreviations for &quot;Reverend&quot; include &quot;Rev.&quot;, &quot;Revd&quot; (or &quot;Revd&quot;), and &quot;Rev&#x27;d&quot;.
&quot;The Reverend&quot; is traditionally used as an adjectival form with first names (or initials) and surname, e.g. &quot;the Reverend John Smith&quot; or &quot;the Reverend J. F. Smith&quot;; if the first names (or initials) are unknown, the correct form is &quot;The Reverend Mr/Mrs/Miss/Ms Smith&quot;. Use of the prefix with the surname alone, e.g. &quot;The Reverend Smith&quot;, is incorrect (a solecism) in formal usage. The style always precedes titles, such as Canon or Doctor.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, it has been increasingly common for the term to be used as a noun and for clergy to be referred to as being either &quot;a reverend&quot; or &quot;the reverend&quot;, or to be addressed as simply &quot;reverend&quot;. This has traditionally been considered incorrect on the basis that it is equivalent to referring to a judge as being &quot;an honourable&quot; or an adult man as &quot;a mister&quot;, both of which are also grammatically improper. It is likewise incorrect to form the plural &quot;reverends&quot;. Some dictionaries, however, do place the noun rather than the adjective as the word&#x27;s principal form, owing to an increasing use of the word as a noun among people with no religious background or knowledge of traditional styles of ecclesiastical address. When several clergy are referred to, they are often styled individually (e.g. &quot;The Reverend John Smith and the Reverend Henry Brown&quot;); in a list of clergy, &quot;the Revv&quot; is sometimes put before the list of names, especially in the Catholic Church in Britain and Ireland.

In a unique case, &quot;the Reverend&quot; was used to refer to a church consistory, a local administrative body. &quot;The Reverend Coetus&quot; and &quot;the Reverend Assembly&quot; were used to refer to the collective body of local officials during the transformation of the Dutch Reformed Church in the mid-18th century.

The use of the Christian term &quot;Reverend&quot; for the rabbi of a congregation was common in Reform Judaism in the 19th and early 20th centuries; however, the Central Conference of American Rabbis deprecated this usage in 1897. The style is also sometimes used by leaders in other religions such as Buddhism.

The origin of the name of Bungay is thought to derive from the Anglo-Saxon title &quot;Bunincga-haye&quot;, signifying the land belonging to the tribe of Bonna, a Saxon chieftain. Due to its high position, protected by the River Waveney and marshes, the site was in a good defensive position and attracted settlers from early times. Roman artefacts have been found in the region.

Bungay Castle, which is shown on Bungay&#x27;s town sign, was originally built by the Normans but was later rebuilt by Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk and his family, who also owned Framlingham Castle. The castle contains a unique surviving example of mining galleries, dating to the siege of the castle in 1174. They were intended to undermine and thus collapse the castle&#x27;s tower and keep.

The Church of St. Mary was once the church of the Benedictine Bungay Priory, founded by Gundreda, wife of Roger de Glanville. The 13th-century Franciscan friar Thomas Bungay later enjoyed a popular reputation as a magician, appearing as Roger Bacon&#x27;s sidekick in Robert Greene&#x27;s Elizabethan comedy &quot;Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay&quot;.

The 11th-century church of Holy Trinity, with its round tower, lies southeast of St. Mary&#x27;s churchyard, while the 19th-century red brick Roman Catholic church of St. Edmund is immediately south of St Mary&#x27;s churchyard.

The town was almost destroyed by a great fire in 1688. The central Buttercross was constructed in 1689 and was the place where local farmers displayed their butter and other farm produce for sale. Until 1810, there was also a Corn Cross, but this was taken down and replaced by a pump.

Bungay was important for the printing and paper manufacture industries. Joseph Hooper, a wealthy Harvard University graduate who fled Massachusetts when his lands were seized after the American Revolution, rented a mill at Bungay in 1783 and converted it for paper manufacture. Charles Brightly established a printing and stereotype foundry in 1795. Then in partnership with John Filby Childs, the business became Brightly &amp; Childs in 1808 and later Messrs. Childs and Son. Charles Childs (1807–1876) succeeded his father as the head of the firm of John Childs &amp; Son. The business was further expanded after 1876 as R. Clay and Sons, Ltd.

The railway arrived with the Harleston to Bungay section of the Waveney Valley Line opening in November 1860 and the Bungay to Beccles section in March 1863. Bungay had its own railway station near Clay&#x27;s Printers. The station closed to passengers in 1953 and freight in 1964.

In 1910 Bungay became an urban district in the administrative county of East Suffolk, the district contained the parish of Bungay. On 1 April 1974 the district and parish were abolished and became part of Waveney district in the non-metropolitan county of Suffolk. A successor parish was formed covering the same area as the former district and its parish. In 2019 it became part of East Suffolk district.

== Modern Bungay ==
Local firms include St. Peter&#x27;s Brewery, based at St. Peter&#x27;s Hall to the south of the town.

In 2008, Bungay became Suffolk&#x27;s first Transition Town and part of a global network of communities that have started projects in the areas of food, transport, energy, education, housing and waste as small-scale local responses to the global challenges of climate change, economic hardship and limited cheap energy.

=== Reeve ===
Bungay is the only town in the United Kingdom still to have a town reeve, though there are surviving portreeves in Laugharne and Ashburton. The reeve runs the town trust, from which each reeve selects the following reeve.

== Black Shuck ==
St Mary&#x27;s Church was struck by lightning on Sunday 4 August 1577. According to legend, an apparition appeared during the thunderstorm, consisting of a black Hell Hound which dashed around the church, attacking members of the congregation. It then suddenly disappeared and re-appeared in Holy Trinity Church, Blythburgh away, injuring members of the congregation there. The dog has been associated with Black Shuck, a dog haunting the coasts of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex.

An image of the Black Dog has been incorporated in the coat of arms of Bungay and has been used in the titles of various enterprises associated with Bungay as well as several of the town&#x27;s sporting events. An annual race, The Black Dog Marathon, begins in Bungay and follows the course of the River Waveney, and the town&#x27;s football club is nicknamed the &quot;Black Dogs&quot;. Black Shuck was also the subject of a song by The Darkness.

==Sport==
The local football club, Bungay Town, play in the Anglian Combination, having previously been members of the Eastern Counties League. The team plays its home games at the Maltings Meadow Sports Ground.

Godric Cycling Club is based in Bungay. It organises a number of events each year, including weekly club runs.

== Notable residents ==
Bungay was home to several literary figures. Thomas Miller (1731–1804), the bookseller and antiquarian, settled in the village. His publisher son, William Miller (1769–1844), was born there. The author Elizabeth Bonhôte, née Mapes, (1744–1818) was born and grew up there, marrying Daniel Bonhôte and writing the notable book &quot;Bungay Castle&quot;, a gothic romance. Bonhôte even once owned Bungay Castle. The Strickland family which, according to the &quot;Canadian Dictionary of Biography&quot;, was as prolific as the Brontës, Edgeworths and Trollopes, settled in the village 1802–08. Their daughters included Agnes Strickland, a historian.

The noted French writer, politician, diplomat and historian, &quot;François-René, vicomte de Chateaubriand&quot; while exiled from France, 1792 – 1800, during the Revolution spent a period living at the Music House, No. 34 Bridge Street. This is recorded on a blue plaque.

Others were Catharine Parr Traill, who concentrated on children&#x27;s literature, and Susanna Moodie, who emigrated to Canada and wrote &quot;Roughing it in the Bush&quot; (1852) as a warning to others. The novelist Sir H. Rider Haggard (1856–1925) was born nearby in Bradenham and presented St. Mary&#x27;s Church with a wooden panel, displayed behind the altar. Religious writer Margaret Barber (1869–1901), author of the posthumously published best-selling book of meditations, &quot;The Roadmender&quot;, settled in Bungay. In 1954, the electrical industry pioneer Caroline Haslett retired to the town to live with her sister Rosalind Messenger.

More recently, Formula 1 motor racing president Bernie Ecclestone was brought up in Bungay and internet activist Julian Assange was confined to nearby Ellingham Hall, Norfolk in 2010–11. Authors Elizabeth Jane Howard and Louis de Bernières have lived in the town. Artist Michael Fell lived in the town in the 1980s and 1990s. Blind artist Sargy Mann moved to Bungay in 1990 and lived there until his death in 2015. Poet Luke Wright has lived in Bungay since 2010. Children&#x27;s author and illustrator James Mayhew lives in Bungay.

Darts professional Andrew Gilding lives in Bungay. Gilding won the PDC&#x27;s UK Open tournament in 2023, defeating Michael van Gerwen 11-10 in the final at Butlin&#x27;s Minehead Resort.

<text>Kessingland is a village and civil parish in the East Suffolk district of the English county of Suffolk. It is located around south of Lowestoft on the east coast of the United Kingdom. It is of interest to archaeologists as Palaeolithic and Neolithic implements have been found here; the remains of an ancient forest lie buried on the seabed.

The parish, which had a population of 4,327 at the 2011 United Kingdom census, borders the parishes of Gisleham, Henstead with Hulver Street and Benacre. It extends from the edge of the Pontins holiday park south of Pakefield in the north to the Hundred River which marks the southern border of the parish. The main A12 road cuts through the parish, bypassing the main built up area of the village.

==History==
There has been a settlement at Kessingland since Palaeolithic times. Between the Hundred River and Latmer Dam was once a large estuary which was used by the Vikings and Romans. The sea provided the village with its main livelihood, and at one time the village paid a rent of 22,000 herrings to their Lords, which then made it more important than nearby Lowestoft.

The Domesday Book of 1086 records: &quot;Kessingalanda / gelanda: King&#x27;s land, kept by Roger Bigot; Earl Hugh and Hugh FitzNorman from him; Hugh de Montfort
Mill (100 herrings). 43 pigs.&quot; Roger Bigod or Bigot was a Norman Knight who came to England in the Norman Conquest.

During the early part of World War II, anti-tank defences and gun batteries were installed at Kessingland to help protect the adjacent stretch of vulnerable coastline and the south of Lowestoft itself. As the threat of invasion receded from 1942 onwards, defence levels were reduced, although the advent of V1s prompted a shift of focus to anti-aircraft defences.
The village comprised two separate communities: the &quot;beach&quot; and the &quot;street&quot; and it was not until the 1960s that more housing united the village into a single community. The population is little over 4,000 – though this can double due to the holiday-makers in the many chalets and holiday villages in the area.

The Suffolk Coast and Heaths area was designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in 1970 and the Suffolk Coasts and Heath Project runs many conservation projects.
St Edmund&#x27;s church is one of the finest in the region. With an imposing tower it was built in around 1436 for the Franciscans of London. The tower, built like many coastal churches to act as a beacon for ships out at sea, constitutes the majority of the medieval structure, the rest having been rebuilt in the ensuing centuries. Renovations continue in the contemporary era, with a new window by Nicola Kantorowicz being added in 2007.

==Governance==
An electoral ward of the same name exists. This ward includes Gisleham and had a total population at the 2011 census of 5,105.

==Features of the village==

Kessingland is home to a Parkdean Resorts holiday park with caravans, chalets and various leisure facilities which are open to the general public, along with other independent parks. There is also a small tearooms housed in a repurposed and refurbished beach hut, which is next to a children&#x27;s playground and a fish and chip shop. Kessingland is also home to Africa Alive, an African-themed zoo. The village also has a medieval church.

== Connections to the arts ==
Sir Henry Rider Haggard, the author of ‘’King Solomon’s Mines’’, was born in Bradenham, but later in his life spent his summers at Kessingland in a cliff-top house called The Grange (now demolished, however a local road, Rider Haggard Lane, is named after Haggard). He was visited by his friend Rudyard Kipling. In a letter to Haggard dated 20 July 1912, his daughter Lillias documented a sighting of a sea serpent off the coast of Kessingland: &quot;we are convinced we saw a sea serpent! I happened to look up when I was sitting on the lawn, and saw what looked like a thin, dark line with a blob at one end, shooting through the water at such a terrific speed it hardly seemed likely that anything alive could go at such a pace ... I suppose it was about 60 feet long.&quot; The letter was printed in the &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot; shortly after. To counter the force of the North Sea and the winds off it, H. Rider Haggard sloped the cliff on the edge of his property and experimented with growing marram grass upon it. The experiment proved a success, and the slope increased in height rather than decreased. He spent the rest of the year at Ditchingham some to the west. In 1928 Kessingland Grange was sold to a Mr Catchpole who established a holiday camp in the grounds, and subsequently demolished the Grange. The current Kessingland Cottages development was begun in 1979.

Acclaimed social history photographer Hardwicke Knight visited Kessingland in the 1950s and documented aspects of the village in a series of vivid 35 mm Kodachrome slide images.

German writer (and sometime lecturer at the University of East Anglia) W. G. Sebald in his second book &quot;The Rings of Saturn&quot; () details a coastal walk along the Suffolk coast. In his book he describes Kessingland beach fishermen with their oilskins and thermoses as resembling &quot;the last stragglers of some nomadic people ... at the outermost limit of the earth, in expectation of the miracle longed for since time immemorial, the miracle which would justify all their erstwhile privations and wanderings.&quot; He also mentions nearby Benacre, Lowestoft and Covehithe.

The horror writer Joseph Freeman was a resident of Kessingland between 2000 and 2009, and has set some of his work there. Most notably the village appeared (as Freshfield, but featuring many familiar landmarks) as the setting for his novel &quot;Vermilion Dawn&quot;.

BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Jan Zalasiewicz recorded a programme about geology on Kessingland&#x27;s stony beach.

Fashion historian and television presenter Amber Butchart is from Kessingland.

The pioneering cave diver, Penelope Powell, was born in Kessingland in 1904.

<text>Davos (, ; ; ; Old ) is an Alpine resort town and municipality in the Prättigau/Davos Region in the canton of Graubünden, Switzerland. It has a permanent population of (). Davos is located on the river Landwasser, in the Rhaetian Alps, between the Plessur and Albula Ranges.

The municipality covers nearly the entire valley of the Landwasser, and the centre of population, economic activity and administration is two adjacent villages, &quot;Davos Dorf&quot; (engl.: Davos Village) and &quot;Davos Platz&quot; (Davos Place), which are above sea level.

Gaining prominence in the 19th century as a mountain health resort, Davos is perhaps best known today for hosting the World Economic Forum, an annual meeting of global political and corporate leaders. With its long history of winter sports, Davos also has one of Switzerland&#x27;s largest ski resorts and hosts the international Spengler Cup, an ice hockey tournament, every December.

==Name==
&quot;Tavau&quot;, the Romansh name, derives from the Latin &quot;tubus&quot;, which is here used in the sense of &quot;ravine&quot;.

==History==
The current settlement of the Davos area began in the High Middle Ages with the immigration of Rhaeto-Romans. The village of Davos is first mentioned in 1213 as &quot;Tavaus&quot;. From about 1280 the barons of Vaz allowed German-speaking Walser colonists to settle and conceded them extensive self-administration rights. In 1289 an agreement between the people of Davos and the baron of Vaz included that the Davoser citizens would not have to pay personal taxes, only the Government of Davos had to pay a yearly amount of goods to the baron of Vaz. Davos became the largest Walser settlement area in eastern Switzerland. Natives still speak a dialect that is atypical for Graubünden, showing similarities with the German spoken in Raron in Canton Valais. In 1338, with the death of the last Baron of Vaz, Davos came into possession of Frederick V, the Count of Toggenburg, who was the brother of the wife of the deceased baron. Davos retained its right to elect its Landamman independently.

In 1436, the League of the Ten Jurisdictions was founded in Davos. In 1438, Davos received additional rights in an agreement in which the League of the Ten Jurisdictions and the rights received in the older treaty from 1289 were both acknowledged. With this agreement, Davos was exempted from trade taxes in the territory of the Ten Jurisdictions and only obliged to provide men for military services within the territory of eight of the Ten Jurisdictions. In 1443 Davos came under the control of the Counts of Montfort, under which Davos also retained its rights. In 1450 an alliance between the League of the Ten Jurisdictions and the League of God&#x27;s House was signed. The Counts of Montfort reached a financial impasse and sold Davos to Duke Sigmund of Tyrol in 1466. This lead Davos to search for support of the two other Raethian leagues and a treaty with the Grey League was reached in 1471. As a result, Davos refused to follow the orders of the Austrian Empire. Eventually a compromise was found, under which Davos would come under the control of the House of Matsch, but Austria kept a right to repurchase Davos.
From the middle of the 19th century, Davos, modeled on Görbersdorf (now Sokołowsko), became a popular destination for the sick and ailing because the microclimate in the high valley was deemed excellent by doctors (initiated by Alexander Spengler) and recommended for lung disease patients. Robert Louis Stevenson, who suffered from tuberculosis, wintered in Davos in 1880 on the recommendation of his Edinburgh physician George Balfour. Arthur Conan Doyle wrote an article about skiing in Davos in 1899. A sanatorium in Davos is also the inspiration for the Berghof Sanitorium in Thomas Mann&#x27;s novel &quot;Der Zauberberg&quot; (&quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;). Between 1936 and 1938, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, then at the end of his life and living in Davos since 1917, depicted Davos and the Junkerboden. His painting has a both Romantic and pantheistic atmosphere and simplified formal structure.

The several sanatoria in Davos attracted a great number of German patients, of which many remained in Davos. As a result, during World War II, in which Switzerland remained neutral, Davos was a centre of Nazi activity in Switzerland. Nowhere else in the country were there more NSDAP members as a share of the population. In the many German-led sanatoria and schools, Nazi salutes and flags were &quot;de rigueur&quot;. Swiss Nazi leader Wilhelm Gustloff&#x27;s 1936 assassination in Davos led to tensions with Nazi Germany. At the end of the war, Federal Councillor Ernst Nobs described Davos as &quot;more nazi-infested than any other Swiss place&quot;. In 2022, Davos mayor Philip Willhelm commissioned a study from historian Stefan Keller documenting the history of Nazi influence in Davos.

During the &quot;natural ice&quot; era of winter sports, Davos and the &quot;Davos Eisstadion&quot; were a mecca for speed skating. Many international championships were held here, and many world records were set, beginning with Peder Østlund who set four records in 1898. The only European Bandy Championship was held in the town in 1913. Subsequently, Davos became a ski resort, especially frequented by tourists from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. After peaking in the 1970s and 1980s, the city settled down as a leading but less high-profile tourist attraction. The American Van Leer family immigrated from here with their former Valär surname. Today Valärs still live and are members of government.

<text>Châlons-en-Champagne () is a city in the Grand Est region of France. It is the capital of the department of Marne, despite being only a quarter the size of the city of Reims.

Formerly called Châlons-sur-Marne, the city was officially renamed in 1995. It should not be confused with the Burgundian town of Chalon-sur-Saône.

==History==

The city was a Gallic and later a Gallo-Roman settlement known in Latin as &quot;Catalaunum&quot;, taking its name from the Catalauni, a Belgic tribe dwelling in the region of modern Champagne.

Châlons is conjectured to be the site of several battles including the Battle of Châlons fought in 274 between Roman Emperor Aurelian and Emperor Tetricus I of the Gallic Empire. The Catalaunian Fields was the site of the battle of Châlons in 451 which turned back the westward advance of Attila. The Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1776. 

==Population==

==Main sights==

* &quot;Saint Etienne&#x27;s cathedral&quot;, including parts of the first Romanesque cathedral built in the 12th century. Nevertheless, it was mainly rebuilt in Gothic style. The west façade (in Baroque style) and two close spans were added in the 17th century.
* &quot;Notre-Dame-en-Vaux&quot; church, part of the UNESCO World Heritage. Built between 1157 and 1217, the collegiate church had a cloister and was a place of pilgrimage in the 12th century, and &quot;Museum du Cloitre de Notre-Dame-en-Vaux&quot; 12th century.
* &quot;Saint-Alpin&quot;, possibly the oldest church of the city. It was rebuilt around 1170 in a Gothic style, but still marked by the Romanesque style.
* &quot;Hôtel de Ville&quot; (city hall): It has a façade representative of the neo-classic period of the end of the 18th century. The steps of the building are protected by four stone lions.
* &quot;Porte Sainte-Croix&quot; (Sainte-Croix Gate), previously called Porte Dauphine, this gate was one of the entries into the city. It was dedicated to Marie-Antoinette when she came via Châlons on her way to Paris to marry the future king Louis XVI of France.
* &quot;La Dernière Relève&quot; (&quot;The Last Relief&quot;), a war memorial next to the cathedral, with group of bronzes by French sculptor Gaston Broquet.
* &quot;Ancien Hotel des Intendants de Champagne&quot; (eighteenth century), today home to the Prefecture of the Champagne-Ardenne region and Prefecture of the Marne.
* &quot;Le Cirque&quot;, the old town circus, completed in 1899, is sheltering the Centre National des Arts du Cirque (CNAC).

==Camp de Mourmelon==
The &quot;Camp de Mourmelon&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Camp de Châlons&quot;) is a military camp of circa 10,000 hectares located near Mourmelon-le-Grand north. It was created at the behest of Napoleon III and opened 30 August 1857 during the Second French Empire.

The initial purpose was simply for practising military manoeuvres, but it quickly turned into a showcase of the French Imperial Army, a theatrical propaganda display, where French citizens could meet the army and watch parades. Each year the camp was transformed into a town of tents and wooden chalets.

The camp survived the fall of the Second Empire in 1870, but changed into a training camp and a departure point for troops engaging in overseas operations.

The camp is used for military manoeuvres, and cavalry training, along with the neighbouring, 2,500 hectare, &quot;Camp de Moronvillers&quot;. Firing of live ordnance (rockets, missiles) is prohibited.

== History ==
The town was established in 1551 by three lords as a location to dig peat which was used for fuel, hence the name (&quot;heer&quot; is &quot;lord&quot;, &quot;veen&quot; is &quot;peat&quot;). Heerenveen was not one of the traditional eleven cities in Friesland (Fryslân) as it did not have so-called city rights. However, it is now one of the larger municipalities of the province.

The windmill &quot;Welgelegen&quot; or &quot;Tjepkema&#x27;s Molen&quot; is the only survivor of seventeen which have stood in Heerenveen.

== Sports ==

Heerenveen is notable for its world class sports facilities. These include the Abe Lenstra football stadium and the Thialf speed skating arena which was one of the first indoor 400m ice rinks in the world, and where international events draw large crowds. Thialf is also home to the city&#x27;s ice hockey team, the Heerenveen Flyers. In 2006, the &quot;Sportstad&quot; (Sport City) project was completed, which included a gymnastics hall, swimming pool and an extension to the football stadium, all clustered together. The Abe Lenstra stadium is unusual because its capacity is larger than the number of inhabitants of the town. One of the few football venues to shares this distinction is Stade Félix Bollaert in Lens, France.

The town&#x27;s football team, SC Heerenveen, plays in the first-tier Eredivisie, topped by the team&#x27;s biggest achievement when they qualified for the UEFA Champions League in 2000.

<doc id="99187" wikidata="Q7003" url="?curid=99187" title="Dijon">
<text>Dijon (, ; ; in Burgundian: &quot;Digion&quot;) is a city in and the prefecture of the Côte-d&#x27;Or department and of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region in eastern France. the commune had a population of 156,920.

The earliest archaeological finds within the city limits of Dijon date to the Neolithic period. Dijon later became a Roman settlement named &quot;Divio&quot;, located on the road between Lyon and Paris. The province was home to the Dukes of Burgundy from the early 11th until the late 15th centuries, and Dijon became a place of tremendous wealth and power, one of the great European centres of art, learning, and science.

The city has retained varied architectural styles from many of the main periods of the past millennium, including Capetian, Gothic, and Renaissance. Many still-inhabited townhouses in the city&#x27;s central district date from the 18th century and earlier. Dijon&#x27;s architecture is distinguished by, among other things, &quot;toits bourguignons&quot; (Burgundian polychrome roofs) made of glazed terracotta tiles of various colours arranged in geometric patterns.

Dijon holds an International and Gastronomic Fair every year in the northern-hemisphere autumn. Dijon also hosts every three years the international flower show &quot;Florissimo&quot;. Dijon has become famous for Dijon mustard, which originated in 1856, when Jean Naigeon of Dijon substituted verjuice, the acidic &quot;green&quot; juice of not-quite-ripe grapes, for vinegar in the traditional mustard recipe. Dijon is a green city with an important tertiary sector, as well as a regional economic centre with a diversified fabric, a traditional food-processing center (Dijon &quot;crême de cassis&quot; and kir, gingerbread, Lanvin chocolate...) and a renowned pharmaceutical sector.

On 4 July 2015, UNESCO registered the historical centre of the city as a World Heritage site, as one of the components of the &quot;Climats, terroirs of Burgundy&quot; site, because of its historical importance in regulating the system of wine production in Burgundy.

==History==

The earliest archaeological finds within the city limits of Dijon date to the Neolithic period. Dijon later became a Roman settlement called &quot;Divio&quot;, which may mean &quot;sacred fountain&quot;, located on the road from Lyon to Paris. Saint Benignus, the city&#x27;s apocryphal patron saint, is said to have introduced Christianity to the area before being martyred. 

This province was home to the Dukes of Burgundy from the early 11th until the late 15th century, and Dijon was a place of tremendous wealth and power and one of the great European centres of art, learning, and science. The Duchy of Burgundy was key in the transformation of medieval times toward early modern Europe. The Palace of the Dukes of Burgundy now houses the Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) and the musée des Beaux-Arts (Museum of Fine Arts).

In 1513, Swiss and Imperial armies invaded Burgundy and besieged Dijon, which was defended by the governor of the province, Louis II de la Trémoille. The siege was extremely violent, but the town succeeded in resisting the invaders. After long negotiations, Louis II de la Trémoille managed to persuade the Swiss and the Imperial armies to withdraw their troops and also to return three hostages who were being held in Switzerland. During the siege, the population called on the Virgin Mary for help and saw the town&#x27;s successful resistance and the subsequent withdrawal of the invaders as a miracle. For those reasons, in the years following the siege, the inhabitants of Dijon began to venerate Notre-Dame de Bon-Espoir (Our Lady of Good Hope). Although a few areas of the town were destroyed, there are nearly no signs of the siege of 1513 visible today. However, Dijon&#x27;s museum of fine arts has a large tapestry depicting this episode in the town&#x27;s history: it shows the town before all subsequent destruction (particularly that which occurred during the French Revolution) and is an example of 16th-century art.

A system of purified water for the citizens of Dijon was constructed by Henry Darcy a quarter-century before Paris was so supplied.

Dijon was also occupied by anti-Napoleonic coalitions in 1814, by the Prussian army in 1870–71, and by Nazi Germany beginning in June 1940, during WWII, when it was bombed by US Air Force B-17 Flying Fortresses, before the liberation of Dijon by the French Army and the French Resistance, 11 September 1944.

==Geography==
Dijon is situated at the heart of a plain drained by two small converging rivers: the Suzon, which crosses it mostly underground from north to south, and the Ouche, on the southern side of town. Farther south is the &quot;côte&quot;, or hillside, of vineyards that gives the department its name. Dijon lies southeast of Paris, northwest of Geneva, and north of Lyon.

===Climate===
Dijon features an oceanic climate (Cfb) with continental influence under the Köppen climate classification. The city is highly influenced by its position far inland in Northeastern France. Thus, winters are cool to cold with moderate frosts at night and thawing conditions during the day while summers are warm to hot and humid with frequent thunderstorms. 


&lt;br&gt;
==Sights==
Dijon has a large number of churches, including Notre Dame de Dijon, St. Philibert, St. Michel, and Dijon Cathedral, dedicated to the apocryphal Saint Benignus, the crypt of which is over 1,000 years old. The city has retained varied architectural styles from many of the main periods of the past millennium, including Capetian, Gothic and Renaissance. Many still-inhabited townhouses in the city&#x27;s central district date from the 18th century and earlier. Dijon architecture is distinguished by, among other things, &quot;toits bourguignons&quot; (Burgundian polychrome roofs) made of glazed terracotta tiles of various colours arranged in geometric patterns.

Dijon was largely spared the destruction of wars such as the 1870 Franco-Prussian War and the Second World War, despite the city being occupied. Therefore, many of the old buildings such as the half-timbered houses dating from the 12th to the 15th centuries (found mainly in the city&#x27;s core district) are undamaged, at least by organized violence.

Dijon is home to many museums, including the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon in part of the Ducal Palace (see below). It contains, among other things, ducal kitchens dating back to the mid-15th century, and a substantial collection of primarily European art, from Roman times through the present.

Among the more popular sights is the Ducal Palace, the &quot;Palais des Ducs et des États de Bourgogne&quot; or &quot;Palace of the Dukes and the States of Burgundy&quot; (), which includes one of only a few remaining examples of Capetian period architecture in the region. Many art interested visitors flock to the &quot;Puits de Moïse&quot; or Well of Moses, a monumental sculpture by Claus Sluter.
The church of Notre Dame is famous for both its art and architecture. Popular legend has it that one of its stone relief sculptures, an owl (&quot;la chouette&quot;) is a : visitors to the church touch the owl with their left hands to make a wish. (The current carving was restored after it was damaged by vandalism in the night of 5 and 6 January 2001).

The Grand Théâtre de Dijon, built in 1828 and one of the main performing venues of the Opéra de Dijon, was declared a of France in 1975. It was designed by the Dijon-born architect Jacques Cellerier (1742–1814) in the Neo-classical style with an interior modelled on Italian opera houses.

==Transport==
=== Roads ===
Dijon is located approximately southeast of Paris, about three hours by car along the A38 and A6 motorways. The A31 provides connections to Nancy, Lille and Lyon. The A39 connects Dijon with Bourg-en-Bresse and Geneva, the A36 with Besançon, Mulhouse and Basel.

=== Water transport ===
The Canal de Bourgogne passes through the heart of Dijon and creates a navigable route to Paris in the north-west via the river Yonne, a tributary of the river Seine, and to the Saône river 25 km to the south-east. The canal joins the Saône at Saint-Jean-de-Losne which is the barging centre of France and Europe. In addition to the connection to the Atlantic via the Seine it has navigable water connections to the Mediterranean—via the Saône to the Rhône river at Lyon and further south (ultimately west to the Atlantic via the Canal du Midi)—Germany and central Europe—via the Rhône-Rhine canal—plus west to the centre and river Loire via the Canal du Centre. These waterways were largely completed before the 19th century and were the main means of industrial transport until the railways began taking over in the mid-19th century. Today they form a water route for mostly pleasure craft between northern Europe and the south. For example the route through Dijon is popular with those sailing their boats from the United Kingdom to the Mediterranean.

=== Public transport ===
==== Trains ====
Dijon is an important railway junction for lines from Paris to Lyon and Marseille, and the east–west lines to Besançon, Belfort, Nancy, Switzerland, and Italy. The Dijon-Ville station is the main railway station, providing service to Paris-Gare de Lyon by TGV high-speed train (LGV Sud-Est), covering the in one hour and 40 minutes. For comparison, Lyon is away and two hours distant by standard train. The city of Nice takes about six hours by TGV and Strasbourg only 1 hour and 56 minutes via the TGV Rhin-Rhône. Lausanne in Switzerland is less than away or two hours by train. Dijon has a direct overnight sleeper/couchette service to Milan, Verona and Venice by the operator Thello. Numerous regional TER Bourgogne-Franche-Comté trains depart from the same station. There is another railway station east of the city centre, Dijon-Porte-Neuve station, on the line to Is-sur-Tille and Culmont-Chalindrey.

==== Trams ====
A new tram system opened in September 2012. Line T1 is an line with 16 stations running west–east from the Dijon railway station to Quetigny. Line T2 opened in December 2012, an north–south line with 21 stations running between Valmy and Chenôve.

==Culture==
Dijon holds its International and Gastronomic Fair every year in autumn. With over 500 exhibitors and 200,000 visitors every year, it is one of the ten most important fairs in France. Dijon is also home, every three years, to the international flower show &quot;Florissimo&quot;.

Dijon has numerous museums such as the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon, the Musée Archéologique, the Musée de la Vie Bourguignonne, the Musée d&#x27;Art Sacré, and the Musée Magnin. It also contains approximately 700 hectares of parks and green space, including the Jardin botanique de l&#x27;Arquebuse.

Dijon is home to the prominent contemporary art centre Le Consortium, a fine-arts school (ENSA), as well as a number of art galleries like the Fonds régional d&#x27;art contemporain, which holds a permanent collection including pieces by locally established artist Yan Pei-Ming.

Apart from the numerous bars, which sometimes have live bands, some popular music venues in Dijon are : Le Zenith de Dijon, La Vapeur, l&#x27;Espace autogéré des Tanneries and l&#x27;Atheneum.

Dijon mustard originated in 1856, when Jean Naigeon of Dijon substituted verjuice, the acidic &quot;green&quot; juice of not-quite-ripe grapes, for vinegar in the traditional mustard recipe. In general, mustards from Dijon today contain white wine rather than verjuice. Dijon mustard is not necessarily produced near Dijon, as the term is regarded as genericized under European Union law, so that it cannot be registered for protected designation of origin status. Most Dijon mustard (brands such as Amora or Maille) is produced industrially and over 90% of mustard seed used in local production is imported, mainly from Canada. In 2008, Unilever closed its Amora mustard factory in Dijon. Dijon mustard shops sell exotic or unusually-flavoured mustard (fruit-flavoured, for example), often sold in decorative hand-painted &quot;faience&quot; (china) pots.

Burgundy is a world-famous wine growing region, and notable vineyards, such as Vosne-Romanée and Gevrey-Chambertin, are within 20 minutes of the city center. The town&#x27;s university boasts a renowned enology institute. The road from Santenay to Dijon is known as the &quot;route des Grands Crus&quot;, where eight of the world&#x27;s top ten most expensive wines are produced, according to Wine Searcher.

The city is also well known for its &quot;crème de cassis&quot;, or blackcurrant liqueur, used in the drink known as &quot;Kir&quot;, named after former mayor of Dijon canon Félix Kir, a mixture of crème de cassis with white wine, traditionally Bourgogne Aligoté.

==Sport==
Dijon is home to Dijon FCO, a football club with a men&#x27;s team competing in the Championnat National and a women&#x27;s team competing in the Division 1 Féminine. 

Dijon has a its own (Pro A) basketball club, JDA Dijon Basket. The Palais des Sports de Dijon serves as playground for the team and hosted international basketball events such as the FIBA EuroBasket 1999 in the past. 

Dijon is also home to the Dijon Ducs ice hockey team, who play in the Magnus League. 

To the northwest, the race track of Dijon-Prenois hosts various motor sport events. It hosted the Formula 1 French Grand Prix on five occasions from 1974 to 1984.

<text>Arezzo ( , ; ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in Italy and the capital of the province of the same name located in Tuscany. Arezzo is about southeast of Florence at an elevation of above sea level. As of 2022, the population was about 97,000.

Known as the city of gold and of the high fashion, Arezzo was home to artists and poets such as Giorgio Vasari, Guido of Arezzo and Guittone d&#x27;Arezzo and in its province to Renaissance artist Michelangelo. In the artistic field, the city is famous for the frescoes by Piero della Francesca inside the Basilica of San Francesco, and the crucifix by Cimabue inside the Basilica of San Domenico. The city is also known for the important Giostra del Saracino, a game of chivalry that dates back to the Middle Ages.

==History==

Described by Livy as one of the &quot;Capita Etruriae&quot; (Etruscan capitals), Arezzo (&quot;Aritim&quot; in Etruscan) is believed to have been one of the twelve most important Etruscan cities—the so-called Dodecapolis, part of the Etruscan League. Etruscan remains establish that the acropolis of San Cornelio, a small hill next to that of San Donatus, was occupied and fortified in the Etruscan period. There is other significant Etruscan evidence: parts of walls, an Etruscan necropolis on &quot;Poggio del Sole&quot; (still named &quot;Hill of the Sun&quot;), and most famously, the two bronzes, the &quot;Chimera of Arezzo&quot; (5th century BC) and the &quot;Minerva&quot; (4th century BC) which were discovered in the 16th century and taken to Florence. Increasing trade connections with Greece also brought some elite goods to the Etruscan nobles of Arezzo: the krater painted by Euphronios c. 510 BC depicting a battle against Amazons (in the Museo Civico, Arezzo 1465) is unsurpassed.
Conquered by the Romans in 311 BC, &quot;Arretium&quot; became a military station on the via Cassia, the road by which Rome expanded into the basin of the Po. Arretium sided with Marius (157 – 86 BC) in the Roman Civil War, and the victorious Sulla ( 138 – 78 BC) planted a colony of his veterans in the half-demolished city, as &quot;Arretium Fidens&quot; (&quot;Faithful Arretium&quot;). The old Etruscan aristocracy was not extinguished: Gaius Cilnius Maecenas, whose name has become eponymous with &quot;patron of the arts&quot;, came of the noble Aretine Etruscan stock. The city continued to flourish as &quot;Arretium Vetus&quot; (&quot;Old Arretium&quot;), the third-largest city in Italy in the Augustan period, well known in particular for its widely exported pottery manufactures, the characteristic moulded and glazed Arretine ware, &quot;bucchero&quot;-ware of dark clay and red-painted vases (the so-called &quot;coral&quot; vases).

Around 261 AD the town council of Arezzo dedicated an inscription to its patron L. Petronius Taurus Volusianus. See that article for discussion of the possible political/military significance of Volusianus&#x27;s association with the city.

In the 3rd to 4th century Arezzo became an episcopal seat: it is one of the few cities whose succession of bishops are known by name without interruption to the present day, in part because the bishops operated as the feudal lords of the city in the Middle Ages. The Roman city was demolished, partly in the course of the Gothic War and of the late-6th-century invasion of the Lombards, partly dismantled, as elsewhere throughout Europe. The Aretines re-used the stones for fortifications. Only the amphitheater remained.

The commune of Arezzo threw off the control of its bishop in 1098 and functioned as an independent city-state until 1384. Generally Ghibelline in tendency, it opposed Guelph Florence. In 1252 the city founded its university, the &quot;Studium&quot;. After the rout of the Battle of Campaldino (1289), which saw the death of Bishop , the fortunes of Ghibelline Arezzo started to ebb, apart from a brief period under the Tarlati family, chief among them Guido Tarlati, who became bishop in 1312 and maintained good relations with the Ghibelline party. The Tarlati sought support in an alliance with Forlì and its overlords, the Ordelaffi, but failed: Arezzo yielded to Florentine domination in 1384; its individual history became subsumed in that of Florence and of the Medicean Grand Duchy of Tuscany. During this period Piero della Francesca ( 1415–1492) worked in the church of San Francesco di Arezzo producing the splendid frescoes, recently restored, which are Arezzo&#x27;s most famous works. Afterwards the city began an economical and cultural decay, which ensured the preservation of its medieval centre.

In the 18th century the neighbouring marshes of the Val di Chiana, south of Arezzo, were drained and the region became less malarial. At the end of the-century French troops led by Napoleon Bonaparte conquered Arezzo, but the city soon turned (1799–1800) into a resistance base against the invaders with the &quot;Viva Maria&quot; movement, winning the city the role of provincial capital. In 1860 Arezzo became part of the Kingdom of Italy.

City buildings suffered heavy damage during World War II; the Germans made a stand in front of Arezzo early in July 1944 and fierce fighting ensued before the British 6th Armoured Division, assisted by New Zealand troops of the 2nd New Zealand Division, liberated the town 16 July 1944. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission&#x27;s Arezzo War Cemetery, where 1,266 men are buried, is located to the north-west of the city.

Pope Benedict XVI visited Arezzo and two other Italian municipalities on May 13, 2012.

==Geography==
Arezzo is set on a steep hill, rising from the floodplain of the River Arno. In the upper part of the town are the cathedral, the town hall and the Medici Fortress (&quot;Fortezza Medicea&quot;), from which the main streets branch off towards the lower part as far as the gates. The upper part of the town maintains its medieval appearance despite the addition of later structures. Arezzo&#x27;s city proper is near the high risk areas for earthquakes, but located in a transitional area where the risk for severe earthquakes is much lower than in nearby Umbria and Abruzzo, albeit it is slightly more vulnerable than Florence. Notable earthquakes are still a very rare phenomenon in the province, with a 4.6 quake to its north-east that claimed no lives on 26 November 2001 the exception.

===Climate===
Arezzo has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot and dry summers combined with mild and rainy winters. The annual average temperature is , the hottest month in August is , and the coldest month is in January. The annual precipitation is , of which November is the wettest with , while July is the driest with only .

Publicly funded, it attracts bands of high repute and attendees from all over Europe and North America. It also features literary and film expositions. In 2007 it was replaced by PLAY Arezzo Art Festival, still about rock music, involving local bands.

Once the main marketplace of the city, it is currently the site of the &quot;Giostra del Saracino&quot; (&quot;Joust of the Saracen&quot;). It has a sloping pavement in red brick with limestone geometrical lines. Aside from the apse of the church, other landmarks of the square include:
*The Palace of the Lay Fraternity (&quot;Fraternita dei Laici&quot;): 14th–15th century palazzo, with a Gothic ground floor and a Quattrocento second floor by Bernardo Rossellino
*The Vasari Loggia along the north side, a flat Mannerist façade designed by Giorgio Vasari
*Episcopal Palace, seat of the bishops, rebuilt in the mid-13th century. The interior has frescoes by Salvi Castellucci, Teofilo Torri and Pietro Benvenuti. In front of the Palace is the Monument to Grand Duke Ferdinando I de&#x27; Medici (1595), by Pietro Francavilla, following a design of Giambologna.
*Palazzo Cofani-Brizzolari, with the Torre Faggiolana
*Remains of the Communal Palace and the Palazzo del Popolo can also be seen.

===Churches===
*Santa Maria della Pieve: the most striking feature of this Romanesque church is the massive, square-planned bell tower with double orders of mullioned windows. The church was built in the 12th century over a pre-existing Palaeo-Christian edifice, and was renovated a century later with the addition of the characteristic façade made of loggias with small arches surmounted by all different-styled columns. Also from the same century is the lunette with the &quot;Virgin between Two Angels&quot; and the sculptures of the months (1216) over the main portal. the interior has a nave and two aisles, with a transept also added in the 13th century. In the following century chapels, niches and frescoes were added, including the polyptych of &quot;Virgin with Child and Saints&quot; by Pietro Lorenzetti (1320). In the crypt is a relic bust of St. Donatus (1346). From the same epoch is the hexagonal baptismal font, with panels of the &quot;Histories of St. John the Baptist&quot;, by Giovanni di Agostino. The &quot;Pieve&quot; was again renovated by Giorgio Vasari in 1560.
*Cathedral of Saint Donatus (13th – early 16th centuries): the façade of this Gothic style church remained unfinished, and was added in the 20th century. The interior has a nave and aisles divided by massive pilasters. The left aisle has a fresco by Piero della Francesca portraying the &quot;Madeleine&quot;. Noteworthy are also the medieval stained glass, the Tarlati Chapel (1334) and the Gothic tomb of Pope Gregory X.
*Basilica of San Francesco (13th–14th centuries): built in Tuscan-Gothic style. Of the projected façade cover in sculpted stone only the lower band was completed. The interior has a single nave: the main attraction is &quot;The History of the True Cross&quot; fresco (1453–1464) cycle by Piero della Francesca in the Bacci Chapel. Under the church is another Basilica with a nave and two aisles (&quot;Basilica inferiore&quot;), today used for art exhibitions.
*Basilica of San Domenico (founded in 1275 and completed in the early 14th century): the interior has a single nave with a &quot;Crucifix&quot; by Cimabue, a masterwork of 13th-century Italian art. Other artworks include a &quot;Sts. Philip and James the Younger and St. Catherine&quot; by Spinello Aretino and other 14th century painting and sculpture decorations.
*Santissimi Annunziata
*San Michele: this church has a modern façade. Traces of the original Romanesque edifice and the Gothic restoration can be seen in the interior.
*Santa Maria in Gradi: this medieval church was initially built in the 11th or the 12th century, but reconstructed in the late 16th century by Bartolomeo Ammannati. The interior has a single nave with stone altars (17th century) and a &quot;Madonna of Misericordia&quot;, terracotta by Andrea della Robbia.
*Church of St. Augustine: founded in 1257, modified in the late 15th and the late 18h centuries. The façade and the interior decoration are largely from Baroque times. The square plan bell tower is from the 15th century.
*Badia delle Sante Flora e Lucilla (12th century): The abbey was built by Benedictine monks in the 12th century, it was totally restored in the 16th century under the direction of Giorgio Vasari. The octagonal bell tower is from 1650. The interior, in Mannerist style, has an illusionistic canvas depicting a false dome by Andrea Pozzo (1702). There are also a &quot;St. Lawrence&quot; fresco by Bartolomeo della Gatta (1476) and a &quot;Crucifix&quot; by Segna di Buonaventura (1319).
*San Lorenzo: one of the most ancient of the city, having been built before the year 1000, most likely in Palaeo-Christian times. Rebuilt in the 13th century and restored in 1538, it was totally rebuilt in 1705. The apse exterior is in Romanesque style.
*Santa Maria delle Grazie: a late Gothic sanctuary with a Renaissance portal by Benedetto da Maiano (1490). It has also a marble high altar by Andrea della Robbia including a pre-existing fresco by Parri di Spinello (1428–1431). The sanctuary was built over a font dedicated to Apollo, which was destroyed by San Bernardino of Siena in 1428, building an oratory in its place. The church was erected in 1435–1444 and has a chapel entitled to St. Bernardino.
*Santa Maria a Gradi (1591): a monastery existing already in 1043. It has a Baroque interior, but with an altar by a collaborator of Andrea della Robbia.
*Santissima Trinità: this church was built in 1348, it was totally renovated in 1723–1748 in Baroque style. It houses a 14th-century Crucifix, a banner painted by Giorgio Vasari in 1572, a painting of &quot;Noli me tangere&quot; by Alessandro Allori (1584) and other artworks.
*Santa Maria Maddalena: built in 1561 over a pre-14th century structure. It houses a &quot;Madonna with Child&quot; (Madonna of the Rose) by Spinello Aretino, visible in the high altar (c. 1525) designed by Guillaume de Marcillat. It is now private property.
*Pieve di San Paolo: erected as Palaeo-Christian baptismal church, rebuilt in the 8th-9th centuries and then rebuilt in Romanesque style in the 13th century. The bell tower is from the 14th-15th centuries. The entire church was again renovated after the 1796 earthquake. It has kept 15th-century frescoes by Lorentino d&#x27;Andrea and a cyborium. The transept entrance has granite columns with marble capitals from the 5th century AD.
*Pieve di Sant&#x27;Eugenia al Bagnoro: documented from 1012, it was one of the most important &quot;pievi&quot; of the diocese during the Middle Ages. The presbytery area is from the 12th century, while the rest is from the 11th century. The bell tower, partially ruined, stands on one of the three apses.
*Pieve di San Donnino a Maiano, at Palazzo del Pero (6th–9th centuries): documented from 1064, it replaced a Palaeo-Christian baptismal church. The frontal part was rebuilt in the 14th century. The apse has 15th century frescoes and a wooden &quot;Madonna with Child&quot; from the same age.

<doc id="99192" wikidata="Q8006913" url="?curid=99192" title="William Clowes (printer)">
<text>William Clowes (1 January 1779 – 26 January 1847) was a British printer who developed the use of steam-powered printing presses in the industry. He founded the printing firm that became William Clowes Ltd. in London in 1803.

Clowes was born in Chichester, Sussex, the eldest son of schoolteachers William Clowes and Elizabeth (née Harraden) Clowes. His father died when William was an infant, and he became a printer&#x27;s apprentice at the age of 10.

In 1803, he moved to London and founded his own business in October 1803 at 22 Villiers Street, with just one employee. Through his wife&#x27;s cousin, William Winchester, Clowes was able to gain access to government printing work which enabled the firm to develop rapidly, moving to Northumberland Court in 1807.

In 1823, Clowes installed a steam-powered printing press designed by Applegarth and Edward Cowper. His factory adjoined the palace of Britain&#x27;s wealthiest man, the Duke of Northumberland, who successfully instituted a court action for noise and pollution abatement. In 1827, the firm took over Applegarth&#x27;s premises in Duke Street, Blackfriars, a site which became the largest printing works in the world, printing a wide variety of works and employing over 500 workers directly.

The development of powered presses by Clowes is credited with increasing levels of accuracy as well as speed of output, making printed material cheaper and more accessible. He was also an innovator in terms of working practices and in 1820, became one of the first employers to start a benevolent fund for this workforce. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.

Clowes married Mary Winchester, the niece of William Winchester, in 1804 and had four daughters and four sons with her. Three of his sons, William, Winchester and George, ran the business which had become William Clowes and Sons in 1839. In 1824, Clowes was made a freeman of Chichester. He died in Marylebone in January 1847, aged 68, and was buried in West Norwood Cemetery.

<doc id="99199" wikidata="Q681007" url="?curid=99199" title="George Gilbert Scott">
<text>Sir George Gilbert Scott (13 July 1811 – 27 March 1878), largely known as Sir Gilbert Scott, was a prolific English Gothic Revival architect, chiefly associated with the design, building and renovation of churches and cathedrals, although he started his career as a leading designer of workhouses. Over 800 buildings were designed or altered by him.

Scott was the architect of many notable buildings, including the Midland Grand Hotel at St Pancras Station, the Albert Memorial, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, all in London, St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Glasgow, the main building of the University of Glasgow, St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Edinburgh and King&#x27;s College Chapel, London.

==Life and career==

Born in Gawcott, Buckingham, Buckinghamshire, Scott was the son of the Reverend Thomas Scott (1780–1835) and grandson of the biblical commentator Thomas Scott. He studied architecture as a pupil of James Edmeston and, from 1832 to 1834, worked as an assistant to Henry Roberts. He also worked as an assistant for his friend, Sampson Kempthorne, who specialised in the design of workhouses, a field in which Scott was to begin his independent career.

===Early work===

Scott&#x27;s first work was built in 1833; it was a vicarage for his father in the village of Wappenham, Northamptonshire. It replaced the previous vicarage occupied by other relatives of Scott. Scott went on to design several other buildings in the village.

In about 1835, Scott took on William Bonython Moffatt as his assistant and later (1838–1845) as his partner. Over ten years or so, Scott and Moffatt designed more than forty workhouses in the wake of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. Their first churches were St Mary Magdalene at Flaunden, Bucks (1838, for Samuel King, Scott&#x27;s uncle); St Nicholas, Newport, Lincoln (1839); St John, Wall, Staffordshire (1839); and the Neo-Norman church of St Peter at Norbiton, Surrey (1841). They built Reading Gaol (1841–42) in a picturesque, castellated style.

===Gothic Revival===

Meanwhile, he was inspired by Augustus Pugin to participate in the Gothic Revival. While still in partnership with Moffat. he designed the Martyrs&#x27; Memorial on St Giles&#x27;, Oxford (1841), and St Giles&#x27; Church, Camberwell (1844), both of which helped establish his reputation within the movement.

Commemorating three Protestants burnt during the reign of Queen Mary, the Martyrs&#x27; Memorial was intended as a rebuke to those very high church tendencies which had been instrumental in promoting the new authentic approach to Gothic architecture. St Giles&#x27; was in plan, with its long chancel, of the type advocated by the Ecclesiological Society: Charles Locke Eastlake said that &quot;in the neighbourhood of London no church of its time was considered in purer style or more orthodox in its arrangement&quot;. It did, however, like many churches of the time, incorporate wooden galleries, not used in medieval churches and highly disapproved of by the high church ecclesiological movement.

In 1844 he received the commission to rebuild the Nikolaikirche in Hamburg (completed 1863), following an international competition. Scott&#x27;s design had originally been placed third in the competition, the winner being one in a Florentine inspired style by Gottfried Semper, but the decision was overturned by a faction who favoured a Gothic design. Scott&#x27;s entry had been the only design in the Gothic style.

In 1854 he remodelled the Camden Chapel in Camberwell, a project in which the critic John Ruskin took a close interest and made many suggestions. He added an apse, in a Byzantine style, integrating it to the existing plain structure by substituting a waggon roof for the existing flat ceiling.

Scott was appointed architect to Westminster Abbey in 1849, and in 1853 he built a Gothic terraced block adjoining the abbey in Broad Sanctuary. In 1858 he designed ChristChurch Cathedral, Christchurch, New Zealand which now lies partly ruined following the earthquake in 2011 and subsequent attempts by the Anglican Church authorities to demolish it. Demolition was blocked after appeals by the people of Christchurch, and in September 2017 the Christchurch Diocesan Synod announced that the cathedral would be reinstated.

The choir stalls at Lancing College in Sussex, which Scott designed with Walter Tower, were among many examples of his work that incorporated green men.

Later, Scott went beyond copying mediaeval English gothic for his &quot;Victorian Gothic&quot; or &quot;Gothic Revival&quot; buildings, and began to introduce features from other styles and European countries as evidenced in his Midland red-brick construction, the Midland Grand Hotel at London&#x27;s St Pancras Station, from which approach Scott believed a new style might emerge.
In 1863, after restoration of the chapel at Sudeley Castle, the remains of Queen Catherine Parr were placed in a new neo-Gothic canopied tomb designed by Gilbert Scott and created by sculptor John Birnie Philip.

Between 1864 and 1876, the Albert Memorial, designed by Scott, was constructed in Hyde Park. It was a commission on behalf of Queen Victoria in memory of her husband, Prince Albert.

Scott advocated the use of Gothic architecture for secular buildings, rejecting what he called &quot;the absurd supposition that Gothic architecture is exclusively and intrinsically ecclesiastical.&quot; He was the winner of a competition to design new buildings in Whitehall to house the Foreign Office and War Office. Before work began, however, the administration which had approved his plans went out of office. Palmerston, the new Prime Minister, objected to Scott&#x27;s use of the Gothic, and the architect – after some resistance – drew up new plans in a more acceptable style.

Scott designed the memorial to Thomas Clarkson in Wisbech, where his brother Rev John Scott was vicar. The Clarkson Memorial was completed after his death under the direction of his son John in 1881.

==Honours==

Scott was awarded the RIBA&#x27;s Royal Gold Medal in 1859. He was appointed an Honorary Liveryman of the Turners&#x27; Company; and on 9 August 1872 he was knighted, choosing the style Sir Gilbert Scott. He died in 1878 and is buried in Westminster Abbey.

A London County Council &quot;blue plaque&quot; (in fact brown) was placed in 1910 to mark Scott&#x27;s residence at the Admiral&#x27;s House on Admiral&#x27;s Walk in Hampstead.

==Family==
Scott married Caroline Oldrid of Boston in 1838. Two of his sons George Gilbert Scott, Jr. (founder of Watts &amp; Company in 1874) and John Oldrid Scott, and his grandson Giles Gilbert Scott, were also prominent architects. His third son, photographer, Albert Henry Scott (1844–65) died at the age of twenty-one; George Gilbert designed his funerary monument in St Peter&#x27;s Church, Petersham, whilst he was living at The Manor House at Ham in Richmond. His fifth and youngest son was the botanist Dukinfield Henry Scott. He was also great-uncle of the architect Elisabeth Scott.

==Pupils==

Scott&#x27;s success attracted a large number of pupils and many would go on to have successful careers of their own, not always as architects. Some notable pupils are as follows, their time in Scott&#x27;s office shown after their name: Hubert Austin (1868), Joseph Maltby Bignell (1859–78), George Frederick Bodley (1845–56), Charles Buckeridge (1856–57), Somers Clarke (1865), William Henry Crossland (dates uncertain), C. Hodgson Fowler (1856–60), Thomas Garner (1856–61), Thomas Graham Jackson (1858–61), John T. Micklethwaite (1862–69), Benjamin Mountfort (1841–46), John Norton (1870–78), George Gilbert Scott, Jr. (1856–63), John Oldrid Scott (1858–78), J. J. Stevenson (1858–60), George Edmund Street (1844–49), and William White (1845–47).

====Other restoration work====
Scott restored the Inner Gateway (also known as the Abbey Gateway) of Reading Abbey in 1860–61 after its partial collapse. St Mary&#x27;s of Charity in Faversham, which was restored (and transformed, with an unusual spire and unexpected interior) by Scott in 1874, and Dundee Parish Church, and designed the chapels of Exeter College, Oxford, St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge and King&#x27;s College, London. He also designed St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Dundee.

Lichfield Cathedral&#x27;s ornate West Front was extensively renovated by Scott from 1855 to 1878. He restored the cathedral to the form he believed it took in the Middle Ages, working with original materials where possible and creating imitations when the originals were not available. It is recognised as some of his finest work.

In 1854 Gilbert Scott began a restoration of Sudeley Castle &quot;working on the western side of the inner court in the style of the existing Medieval and Elizabethan buildings&quot; and subsequently began the restoration of St Mary&#x27;s chapel, with the assistance of John Drayton Wyatt.

<text>Sir Giles Gilbert Scott (9 November 1880 – 8 February 1960) was a British architect known for his work on the New Bodleian Library, Cambridge University Library, Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, Battersea Power Station, Liverpool Cathedral, and designing the iconic red telephone box.

Scott came from a family of architects. His father George Gilbert Scott Jr. was a co-founder of Watts &amp; Co., which Scott became the second chairman of. He was noted for his blending of Gothic tradition with modernism, making what might otherwise have been functionally designed buildings into popular landmarks.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Born in Hampstead, London, Scott was one of six children and the third son of George Gilbert Scott Jr. and his wife, Ellen King Samson. His father was an architect who had co-founded the architecture and interior design company Watts &amp; Co. in 1874. His paternal grandfather was Sir (George) Gilbert Scott, a more famous architect, known for designing the Albert Memorial and the Midland Grand Hotel at St Pancras Station.

When Scott was three, his father was declared to be of unsound mind and was temporarily confined to the Bethlem Royal Hospital. Consequently, his sons saw little of him. Giles later said that he remembered seeing his father only twice. A bequest from an uncle in 1889 gave the young Scott ownership of Hollis Street Farm, near Ninfield, Sussex, with a life tenancy to his mother. During the week Ellen Scott and her three sons lived in a flat in Battersea, spending weekends and holidays at the farm. She regularly took them on cycling trips to sketch buildings in the area, and encouraged them to take an interest in architecture. Among the buildings the young Scott drew were Battle Abbey, Brede Place and Etchingham Church; Scott&#x27;s son, Richard Gilbert Scott, suggests that the last, with its solid central tower, &quot;was perhaps the germ of Liverpool Cathedral&quot;.

Scott and his brothers were raised as Roman Catholics; their father was a Catholic convert. Giles attended Beaumont College on the recommendation of his father who admired the buildings of its preparatory school, the work of J. F. Bentley. In January 1899 Scott became an articled pupil in the office of Temple Moore, who had studied with Scott&#x27;s father. From Moore, or Ellen Scott, or from his father&#x27;s former assistant P. B. Freeman, Scott got to know the work of his father. In a 2005 study of Scott&#x27;s work, John Thomas observes that Scott senior&#x27;s &quot;important church of St Agnes, Kennington (1874–77; 1880s–93) clearly influenced Giles&#x27;s early work, including Liverpool Cathedral Lady Chapel.&quot;

In later years Scott remarked to John Betjeman, &quot;I always think that my father was a genius. … He was a far better architect than my grandfather and yet look at the reputations of the two men!&quot; Scott&#x27;s father and his grandfather had been exponents of High Victorian Gothic; Scott, when still a young man, saw the possibility of designing in Gothic without the profusion of detail that marked their work. He had an unusually free hand in working out his ideas, as Moore generally worked at home, leaving Freeman to run the office.

===Liverpool Cathedral===

In 1901, while Scott was still a pupil in Moore&#x27;s practice, the diocese of Liverpool announced a competition to select the architect of a new cathedral. Two well-known architects were appointed as assessors for an open competition for architects wishing to be considered. G. F. Bodley was a leading exponent of the Gothic revival style, and a former pupil and relative by marriage of Scott&#x27;s grandfather. R. Norman Shaw was an eclectic architect, having begun in the Gothic style, and later favouring what his biographer Andrew Saint calls &quot;full-blooded classical or imperial architecture&quot;. Architects were invited by public advertisement to submit portfolios of their work for consideration by Bodley and Shaw. From these, the two assessors selected a first shortlist of architects to be invited to prepare drawings for the new building.

For architects, the competition was an important event; not only was it for one of the largest building projects of its time, but it was only the third opportunity to build an Anglican cathedral in England since the Reformation in the 16th century (St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral being the first, rebuilt from scratch after the Great Fire of London in 1666, and Truro Cathedral being the second, begun in the 19th century). The competition attracted 103 entries, from architects including Temple Moore, Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Charles Reilly. With Moore&#x27;s approval, Scott submitted his own entry, on which he worked in his spare time.

In 1903, the assessors recommended that Scott should be appointed. There was widespread comment at the nomination of a 22-year-old with no existing buildings to his credit. Scott admitted that so far his only design to be constructed had been a pipe-rack. The choice of winner was even more contentious when it emerged that Scott was a Roman Catholic, but the assessors&#x27; recommendation was accepted by the diocesan authorities.

Because of Scott&#x27;s age and inexperience, the cathedral committee appointed Bodley as joint architect to work in tandem with him. A historian of Liverpool Cathedral observes that it was generous of Bodley to enter into a working relationship with a young and untried student. Bodley had been a close friend of Scott&#x27;s father, but his collaboration with the young Scott was fractious, especially after Bodley accepted commissions to design two cathedrals in the US, necessitating frequent absences from Liverpool. Scott complained that this &quot;has made the working partnership agreement more of a farce than ever, and to tell the truth my patience with the existing state of affairs is about exhausted&quot;. Scott was on the point of resigning when Bodley died suddenly in 1907, leaving him in charge. The cathedral committee appointed Scott sole architect, and though it reserved the right to appoint another co-architect, it never seriously considered doing so.
In 1910 Scott realised that he was not happy with the main design, which looked like a traditional Gothic cathedral in the style of the previous century. He persuaded the cathedral committee to let him start all over again (a difficult decision, as some of the stonework had already been erected) and redesigned it as a simpler and more symmetrical building with a single massive central tower instead of the original proposal for twin towers. Scott&#x27;s new plans provided more interior space. At the same time Scott modified the decorative style, losing much of the Gothic detailing and introducing a more modern, monumental style.

The Lady Chapel, the first part of the building to be completed, was consecrated in 1910 by Bishop Chavasse in the presence of two archbishops and 24 other bishops. Work was severely limited during the First World War, with a shortage of manpower, materials and money. By 1920, the workforce had been brought back up to strength and the stone quarries at Woolton, source of the red sandstone for most of the building, reopened. The first section of the main body of the cathedral was complete by 1924, and on 19 July 1924, the 20th anniversary of the laying of the foundation stone, the cathedral was consecrated in the presence of King George V and Queen Mary, and bishops and archbishops from around the globe.

Construction continued throughout the 1930s, but slowed drastically throughout the Second World War, as it had done during the First. Scott continued to work on the project until his death, refining the design as he went. He designed every aspect of the building down to the fine details. The cathedral was finished in 1978, nearly two decades after Scott&#x27;s death.

===Other early work===
While Scott was feuding with Bodley in Liverpool, he managed to design and see built his first complete church. This was the Church of the Annunciation, a Roman Catholic church in Bournemouth, in which he made a high transept similar to his original plan for Liverpool. His work on another new Roman Catholic church at Sheringham, Norfolk showed his preference for simple Gothic frontages. Other churches built by Scott at this time, at Ramsey on the Isle of Man, Northfleet in Kent and Stoneycroft in Liverpool, show the development of his style. Scott and his brother Adrian worked on Grey Wings, a house in Ashtead, Surrey in 1913. While working in Liverpool, Scott met and married Louise Wallbank Hughes, a receptionist at the Adelphi Hotel; his mother was displeased to learn that she was a Protestant. The marriage was happy, and lasted until Louise Scott&#x27;s death in 1949. They had three sons, one of whom died in infancy.

During the First World War Scott was a Major in the Royal Marines. He was in charge of building sea defences on the English Channel coast.

===1920s===

As Liverpool Cathedral rose Scott&#x27;s fame grew, and he began to secure commissions for secular buildings. One of the first was for Clare College, Cambridge, Memorial Court, which was in a neo-Georgian style on the west bank of the River Cam. This style was also used for Chester House, a house he designed for himself in Clarendon Place, Paddington in 1924, which won the annual medal for London street architecture of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1928. Scott&#x27;s residential buildings are few; one of the best known is the Cropthorne Court mansion block in Maida Vale, where the frontage juts out in diagonals, eliminating the need for lightwells.

Scott continued working on churches during the inter-war years. Shortly after his work on the nave at Downside Abbey he was commissioned to design the small Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady &amp; St Alphege, Bath, the first part of which was completed in 1929. His design was inspired by the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Rome. Scott&#x27;s distillation of the main elements of that large and ancient church into the much smaller Bath parish church has been described as &quot;a delight&quot; which &quot;cannot fail to astonish&quot;. Some 25 years later he wrote &quot;The church was my first essay into the Romanesque style of architecture. It has always been one of my favourite works&quot;. On the capital of one of the pillars beneath the west gallery W. D. Gough carved a representation of the architect, and a shield inscribed &quot;Aegidio architecto&quot; (By Giles the architect) – possibly the only depiction of Scott in stone.

Scott&#x27;s most ubiquitous design was for the General Post Office. He was one of three architects invited by the Royal Fine Arts Commission to submit designs for new telephone kiosks. The invitation came at the time Scott was made a trustee of Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum. His design was in the classical style, topped with a dome reminiscent of the mausoleum Soane designed for himself in St Pancras Old Church yard, London. It was the chosen design and was put into production in cast iron as the GPO&#x27;s &quot;Kiosk no. 2&quot; or &quot;K2&quot;. In 1932 the design was expanded to include a posting box and two stamp vending machines as &quot;Kiosk no. 4&quot; or &quot;K4&quot;. Later designs adapted the same general look for mass production: the Jubilee kiosk, introduced for King George V&#x27;s silver jubilee in 1935 and known as the &quot;K6&quot;, eventually became a fixture in almost every town and village.

===1930s===
In 1930 the London Power Company engaged Scott as consulting architect for its new electricity generating station at Battersea. The building was designed by the company&#x27;s chief engineer, Leonard Pearce, and Scott&#x27;s role was to enhance the external appearance of the massive architecture. He opted for external brickwork, put some detailing on the sheer walls, and remodelled the four corner chimneys so that they resembled classical columns. Battersea Power Station, opened in 1933 but disused since 1982, remains one of the most conspicuous industrial buildings in London. At the time of its opening, &quot;The Observer&quot;, though expressing some reservations about details of Scott&#x27;s work, called it &quot;one of the finest sights in London&quot;. In a poll organised by &quot;The Architectural Review&quot; in 1939 to find what lay people thought were Britain&#x27;s best modern buildings, Battersea Power Station was in second place, behind the Peter Jones building.
In Cambridge, next to Clare College&#x27;s Memorial Court, Scott designed the enormous library for the entire University of Cambridge. He placed two six-storey courtyards in parallel with a twelve-storey tower in the centre, and linked the windows vertically to the bookstacks. The main reading room measured nearly by and high, lit by 25 round-headed clerestory windows on each side. At the time of its opening in 1934, &quot;The Times&quot; commented that the building displayed &quot;the same enjoyment of modelling in mass which is Sir Giles Scott&#x27;s chief personal contribution to contemporary architecture.&quot;

Scott was elected president of the Royal Institute of British Architects for 1933, its centenary year (having already been awarded the RIBA&#x27;s prestigious Royal Gold Medal in 1925). In his presidential address he urged colleagues to adopt what he called &quot;a middle line&quot;: to combine the best of tradition with a fresh modern approach, to eschew dogma, and recognise &quot;the influence of surroundings on the choice of materials and the technique of their use. … My plea is for a frank and common-sense acceptance of those features and materials which are practical and beautiful, regardless as to whether they conform with the formula of either the modern or the traditional school.&quot;

From 1937 to 1940, Scott worked on the New Bodleian Library, in Broad Street in Oxford. It is not generally considered his finest work. Needing to provide storage for millions of books without building higher than the surrounding structures, he devised a construction going deep into the earth, behind two elevations no higher than those around them. His biographer A S G Butler commented, &quot;In an attempt to be polite to these – which vary from late Gothic to Victorian Tudor – Scott produced a not very impressive neo-Jacobean design&quot;. A later biographer, Gavin Stamp, praises the considerable technical achievement of keeping the building low in scale by building underground, but agrees that aesthetically the building is not among Scott&#x27;s most successful. Nikolaus Pevsner dismisses it as &quot;neither one thing nor the other&quot;.

===1940s===
Scott&#x27;s search for the &quot;middle line&quot; caused him difficulties when he was appointed as architect for the new Coventry Cathedral in 1942. Pressured by the new Bishop of Coventry for a modern design and by the Royal Fine Arts Commission for a recreation of the old cathedral, he was criticised for trying to compromise between the two and designing a building that was neither fish nor fowl. Unable to reconcile these differences Scott resigned in 1947; a competition was held and won by Basil Spence with an uncompromisingly modern design.

After the Commons chamber of the Palace of Westminster was destroyed by bombs in 1941, Scott was appointed in 1944 to rebuild it. Here he was hemmed in entirely by the surviving building, but was entirely of the view that the new chamber should be congruent with the old as anything else would clash with the Gothic style of Charles Barry and Augustus Pugin. This view found favour with Winston Churchill who observed &quot;We shape our buildings and afterwards our buildings shape us&quot;. In a debate on 25 January 1945, the House of Commons approved his choice by 121 to 21.

===Last years===
After the immediate rush for building work caused by war damage had died down, Scott put a new roof on the Guildhall in the City of London and designed modernistic brick offices for the Corporation just to the north. Despite having opposed placing heavily industrial buildings in the centre of cities, he accepted a commission to build Bankside Power Station on the bank of the River Thames in Southwark, where he built on what he had learnt at Battersea and gathered all the flues into a single tower. This building was converted in the late 1990s into Tate Modern art gallery.

Scott continued to receive commissions for religious buildings. At Preston, Lancashire he built a Roman Catholic church which is notable for an unusually long and repetitive nave. His Carmelite Church in Kensington, up the road from St Mary Abbots built by his grandfather, used transverse concrete arches to fill a difficult site (the church replaced another lost in the war). Scott created the design of the Trinity College Chapel in Toronto, completed in 1955, a lovely example of the perpendicular Gothic, executed by the local firm of George and Moorhouse and featuring windows by E. Liddall Armstrong of Whitefriars.

Scott remained working into his late 70s. He was working on designs for the Roman Catholic Church of Christ the King, Plymouth, when he developed lung cancer. He took the designs into University College Hospital, where he continued to revise them until his death aged 79.

===Burial and grave===
Scott was buried by the monks of Ampleforth Abbey outside the west entrance of Liverpool Cathedral, alongside his wife (Scott specifically requested that no body should be interred inside the building as he did not want it to become a mausoleum). Although originally planned in the 1942 design for the west end of the cathedral to be within a porch, the site of the grave was eventually covered by a car park access road. The road layout was changed, the grave was restored and the grave marker replaced in 2012.

A requiem mass for Scott was celebrated by Father Patrick Casey at St James&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, Spanish Place, London, on 17 February 1960.

===Family===
In addition to his father and grandfather, other members of Scott&#x27;s family who were architects included an uncle, John Oldrid Scott, a brother, Adrian Gilbert Scott and son Richard Gilbert Scott.

==Honours==
Following the consecration of Liverpool Cathedral, Scott was knighted by King George V at Knowsley Hall, where the King and Queen were staying as guests of the 17th Earl of Derby.

In 1944 he was appointed a Member of the Order of Merit (OM) by King George VI.

On 9 November 2020, the 140th anniversary of Scott&#x27;s birth, he was honoured with a Google Doodle depicting his red telephone boxes.

<doc id="99201" wikidata="Q5537393" url="?curid=99201" title="George Buck">
<text>Sir George Buck (or Buc) (October 1622) was an English antiquarian, historian, scholar and author, who served as a Member of Parliament, government envoy to Queen Elizabeth I and Master of the Revels to King James I of England.

He served in the war against the Spanish Armada in 1588 and on the Cadiz expedition of 1596. He was appointed Esquire of the Body in 1588 and a Member of Parliament for Gatton, Surrey in the 1590s, also acting at times as an envoy for Queen Elizabeth. In 1603, on the accession to the throne of King James I, Buck was made a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber and knighted. In 1606, he began to license plays for publication. In 1610, he became Master of the Revels, responsible for licensing and supervising plays in Britain, including Shakespeare&#x27;s later plays, and censoring them with respect to the depiction of religion and politics.

Buck&#x27;s writings include a verse work, &quot;Daphnis Polystephanos: An Eclog...&quot; (1605), an historical-pastoral poem in celebration of James I&#x27;s royal ancestors. His treatise &quot;The Third Vniversite of England&quot; (1615) describes the educational facilities in London. His major prose work was &quot;The History of King Richard the Third&quot;, which he left in rough draft at his death. His great-nephew extensively altered it and finally published it in 1646 as his own work. Buck defended King Richard III, examining critically the accusations against him. He also discovered and introduced important new historical sources, especially the Croyland Chronicle and the Titulus Regius, which justified Richard&#x27;s accession to the crown.

==Early life and career==
Buck was baptised on 1 October 1560 in Holy Trinity, Ely, Cambridgeshire. He was the eldest son and probably second of the four children of Elizabeth Nunn, &quot;née&quot; Petterill, of Brandon Ferry, Suffolk, and Robert Buck (d. 1580), a church official. His great-grandfather, Sir John Buck, was executed after supporting Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field.

Buck was educated by his half-sister&#x27;s husband, Henry Blaxton, privately and then at Blaxton&#x27;s school in Chichester. Buck attended Cambridge University, and by 1580 he had undertaken legal studies in London, finishing at the Middle Temple in 1585. He carried dispatches for the government from France in 1587 and served under his patron the Lord Admiral, Charles Howard of Effingham, against the Spanish Armada in 1588 and on the successful Cadiz expedition of 1596 led by Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, also acting as emissary from its commanders to Queen Elizabeth. He was appointed Esquire of the Body in 1588 and was the Member of Parliament for Gatton, Surrey in the parliaments of 1593 and 1597. He continued to act as an envoy for the queen afterwards, serving on diplomatic missions to Flanders in 1601 and Spain in 1605.

==Master of the Revels==
In 1597, the queen seems to have promised Buck the reversion (the right to succeed to an office when it next fell vacant) of the office of Master of the Revels. The office was held at the time by Buck&#x27;s relation by marriage, Edmund Tilney. The playwright John Lyly, however, believed that since about 1585 Queen Elizabeth had led him to expect appointment to the post. He was vocal in his distress, writing letters of protest and supplication. The reversion was formally conferred on Buck in 1603, on the accession to the throne of King James I. Also upon the accession of James I, Buck was made a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber and knighted. At the same time, he inherited his aunt&#x27;s lands in Lincolnshire. In 1606, he began to license plays for publication.

The function of the Master of the Revels was to supervise the arrangements for entertainments presented at court, at the various royal residences or wherever the monarch was in attendance, and to censor plays before they were performed in public theatres. Buck was thus responsible for censoring, among other works, Shakespeare&#x27;s later plays, and for supervising performances of them and of any earlier Shakespeare plays revived for court performance, which he had to re-censor, due to the regulations added against blasphemy in 1606. Buck noted on the title page of the play &quot;George-a-Greene, the Pinner of Wakefield&quot; that he had discussed its authorship with Shakespeare. Censorship was exercised in matters of profanity and in sensitive issues of religion and politics, particularly the portrayal of royalty. Judging from his notes in the two manuscript play scripts that show his hand, &quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; (1611) and &quot;John van Olden Barnavelt&quot; (1619), Buck was conscientious and learned, but gentle in his censorship.

Buck also attended the tournaments of running at the ring at the Jacobean court. This was a semi-theatrical equestrian exercise, where riders competed in teams, winning prizes by lifting a ring with their lances.

Buck wrote a treatise on the &quot;Art of Revels&quot;, but the work is lost. He refers to it in another treatise, praising the state of drama in London and writing: &quot;the Art of &quot;Reuels&quot; ... requireth knowledge in Grammar, Rhetorike, Logicke, Philosophie, Historie, Musick, Mathematikes, &amp; in other Arts ... &amp; hath a setled place within this Cittie. ... I haue discribed it, and discoursed thereof at large in a particular commentarie&quot;.

==Scholarly work==
Buck was an historian and minor poet. His main verse work, &quot;ΔΑΦΝΙΣ ΠΟΛΥΣΤΕΦΑΝΟΣ (Daphnis Polystephanos): An Eclog Treating of Crownes, and of Garlandes...&quot; (1605), an historical-pastoral poem, was written to glorify and celebrate King James I&#x27;s royal ancestors on the occasion of his coronation. It mentions Richard III favourably &quot;because / All accusations of him are not proued, / And he built churches, and made good law&#x27;s / And all men held him wise, and valiant&quot;, and it concludes that he deserved his royal rank. Buck&#x27;s treatise &quot;The Third Vniversite of England&quot; (1615) describes the educational facilities in London, from cosmetology to law and medicine, including heraldry, poetry, music, athletics and drama, and enumerates the diversity of arts, crafts, culture, wealth and populace of the city. This earned him, in William Maitland&#x27;s estimate, the place after John Stow as an early historian of London. Among his other works was &quot;The Baron&quot;, an extensive treatment of the history of English titles and offices, which is not extant, although some of the material he collected for it survives. His only surviving genealogical work, &quot;A Commentary Vpon ... Liber Domus DEI&quot;, a finished manuscript, describes the history of the families who came to England with William the Conqueror.
His major prose work was &quot;The History of King Richard the Third&quot;, which he completed in 1619 and left in rough draft at his death, and which, in 1731, was burnt around the edges in the Cotton library fire. Before that, the work had suffered more serious damage, coming into the hands of Buck&#x27;s great-nephew, George Buck, who used it as he did others of Buck&#x27;s works: he produced manuscript copies that he dedicated to various patrons from whom he sought advancement, passing them off as his own. Gradually he altered the &quot;History&quot;, cutting it, making it look like something written in his own time, rather than earlier, by deleting names of Buck&#x27;s learned contemporaries who had shared sources and &quot;viva voce&quot; information with him, and altering or deleting documentation of sources, with the details of which, also, his copyist was careless. Finally in 1646 he published a version of the &quot;History&quot; that was slightly over half the length of the original. A second issue (usually referred to erroneously as a second edition) appeared the next year, leading to the assumption that Buck invented many of his sources. This damaged Buck&#x27;s scholarly reputation for centuries. The authentic text of Buck&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; was not published until 1979; the editor, Arthur Kincaid, was able to find all but seven of the hundreds of sources that Buck had meticulously documented.

Buck originated the pattern adopted by all later defences of Richard III, weighing the evidence impartially and pointing out that suspicion has no weight from a legal point of view. He first summarises Richard&#x27;s life and reign, then discusses the accusations against him in turn, criticising sources of information about them on the basis of their reasons for bias, referring to original authoritative documents and oral reports. He also discusses the legality of Richard&#x27;s title and surveys his achievements. Buck discovered and introduced important new historical sources, such as the &quot;Croyland Chronicle&quot; and through it the petition in Parliament (&quot;Titulus Regius&quot;) that declared Edward IV&#x27;s children illegitimate and justified Richard III&#x27;s accession to the crown – a document that King Henry VII tried, and almost managed, to suppress. William Camden praised Buck&#x27;s scholarship, calling him &quot;a man learned in letters and who observed much in histories and shared it with me&quot;.

==Last years and death==
The Exchequer delayed, from 1613, in paying wages to Buck and his Revels Office associates. Buck became unable to discharge his duties as Master of the Revels by March 1622, was declared insane the following month, and was succeeded in office by Sir John Astley. He died in October of that year, leaving a considerable estate. His &quot;nephew Stephen Buck presented a will, either forged or made after Sir George became insane, designating himself and his son George the heirs&quot;.

<text>The Croyland Chronicle, also called Crowland Chronicle, is an important primary source for English medieval history, particularly the late 15th century. It is named for its place of origin, the Benedictine Abbey of Croyland or Crowland, in Lincolnshire, England. It was formerly also known as the Chronicle of Ingulf or Ingulphus after its supposed original compiler, the 11th-century abbot Ingulf. As that section of the text is now known to have been a later forgery, its author is instead known as Pseudo-Ingulf. The validity of the source itself has been questioned, partially due to the unknown identity of the original author, and gaps in all continuations of the text. There has also been substantially little effort made to find and translate the original manuscript.

==Contents==
Several historical chronicles were written at the Abbey of Croyland, which was the wealthiest religious foundation in eastern England during the Middle Ages. Alison Weir writes that the chronicles dated before 1117 are &quot;spurious&quot;, while the three anonymously written &quot;continuations&quot; that span the periods 1144–1469, 1459–1486 and 1485–1486 are genuine.

The first entry of the chronicle concerns 655AD. Text credited to the Abbot Ingulf follows the initial founding of Croyland Abbey, dedicated to St Guthlac by King Æthelbald, as well as its destruction by the Danes in the late 9th century, and the rebuilding of the monastery. A forged part of the text was formerly used to support the existence of a form of the &quot;congé d&#x27;élire&quot;—royal power over investiture of bishops—in Anglo-Saxon England prior to the Norman Conquest.

The part that covers the years 1459–1486, called the Second Continuation, was written in April 1486, after Henry Tudor had become King Henry VII of England. The text is concerned primarily with the prelude of the War of the Roses, and mild recounting of the battles fought between Richard III and Henry VII. It was written by someone who had access to information from the court of Richard III—described as being a doctor of canon law and member of Edward IV&#x27;s council. Some historians believe that author was John Russell, Bishop of Lincoln, who was Richard&#x27;s Lord Chancellor for most of his reign (until Richard dismissed him on 24 July 1485). Others conclude the work was written by a monk of Crowland who has edited a secular source.

Over the years, there has been confusion between the second and third continuators, and the fourth continuator claims not to know the identity of the third. It is, in fact, the second continuator (covering the period 1459–1486) who claims to be writing in April 1486, and, sure enough, this section ends with the marriage of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York and the rebellion that followed. This date ties in with the survival of a copy of &quot;Titulus Regius&quot; in the text, and Russell is known to have been at Crowland during April 1486.

<text>Dominic Mancini () was an Italian monk who visited England in 1482–3. He witnessed the events leading up to Richard III being offered the English crown. He left in 1483 and wrote a report of what he had witnessed, titling his text &quot;De Occupatione Regni Anglie per Riccardum Tercium&quot; (&#x27;The Occupation of the Throne of England by Richard III&#x27;). The account is a major source of information about the period, but it remained lost until rediscovered in 1934 in the Municipal Library of Lille, France, and was subsequently published by C. A. J. Armstrong.

Mancini&#x27;s report was written for Angelo Cato, Archbishop of Vienne, one of the counsellors of King Louis XI of France and also his doctor and astrologer.

<text>George E. Clymer (–1834), printing press inventor and manufacturer, from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was an American engineer and all around inventor. Clymer, in his earlier vocational years, was something of a civil engineer and as an inventor became noted for his improvements and developments in early nineteenth century printing presses, and ultimately developed his own distinctive printing press, which soon became widely known as the Columbian Printing Press, which were often favorably received by printers in America, England and parts of Europe. After relocating to England because of better market conditions, Clymer subsequently became one of the principal developers and suppliers of printing presses in Europe in the early nineteenth century. The innovative designs he incorporated into his printing presses were put to use in the manufacturing of other printing presses years after his death.

==Early life and family==
Clymer was born and raised on his father&#x27;s large farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, on the northern border of Philadelphia. His family was from Switzerland, and they arrived in the British-American colonies in the early 1700s. He received his basic education from the local schools, during which time he also bust helping his father with the daily chores of farm life where he proved to be skillful at repairing, improving and modifying farm equipment. In one instance Clymer demonstrated his mechanical skill when he created a unique plough, greatly superior to conventional ploughs, that was more suitable for tilling the difficult soils in that part of the state, attracting the attention of various inventors of that time. At age sixteen he learned the trade of carpentry and continued in this capacity for twenty-five years in his home neighborhood, applying his skills and industry in many ways. Printing historian Charles Henry Timperley reports that Clymer was a rather tall individual who bore a &quot;manly and dignified countenance&quot;. He married Margaret Backhouse, the daughter of Judge Richard Backhouse of the Durham Iron Works in Pennsylvania. Clymer&#x27;s marriage produced several children. By 1797, Clymer continued to put his mechanical skill to use and began making improvements on conventional wooden printing presses.

==Inventor==
Clymer moved to Philadelphia around 1800, where the construction of the first permanent bridge to span the Schuylkill River, where it passed through Philadelphia, was in progress. While the construction of the piers was underway he became interested in hydraulics and developed a special purpose pump, for which he became widely noted, capable of discharging 500 hundred gallons of water a minute, and also capable of dredging and removing sand and gravel at the same time. Thoroughly tested in the field, Clymer&#x27;s pump proved to be far more efficient than any other pumps in the area at that time, and he received a U.S. patent on December 22, 1801, for the pump. He eventually introduced his pump in Great Britain where he also received a patent.

Soon after he became interested in printing press operations and produced his own wooden printing presses, while making adding significant improvements to their design and function. By 1805, he was listed in a city directory as a printing press maker. Clymer, along with a number of his contemporaries in Philadelphia, continued making minor improvements to existing wooden printing presses. He was one of the first to significantly improve upon the centuries-old design of the common press that were in use before and during the 1700s. He made changes in the method of cutting the large iron screw, mounting the platen differently, and employing rollers instead of sliding cramp irons for moving the platen into place. Soon he made the iron hand-press that shared some of its design principles with the press made by English inventor Earl of Stanhope. However, there were only two Stanhope presses in America at the time, and there is no evidence that Clymer ever saw the actual machine. Historians estimate that before 1800 Clymer initially began making wooden presses of the type that was commonly used in the eighteenth century and may have introduced his own improvements and modifications to the conventional design. 

By 1813, after sixteen years of persistent effort, Clymer invented his own press, which he called the Columbian Printing Press, which soon pushed the Stanhope press out of the market in Europe. One of the most useful features of his printing press was the employment of a series of power-multiplying compound levers, making the effort of the pressing operation much easier, as it did not require near as much exertion from the printer to effect the pressing action. Clymer&#x27;s printing press was considered the first significant American invention in the printing industry in both American and England. His press included a lever-operated press and platen, and in little time proved to be the greatest improvement in printing presses over the wooden hand-printing presses of the 1700s ever attained at any one time. Before this, wooden presses, which had previously been employed in Europe since the fifteenth century, and also used in the American colonies since the 1600s, including those made by Adam Ramage, were commonly used. Clymer, taking advantage of current developments in iron-casting techniques, constructed his press out of cast-iron, with elaborate ornamentation about the structure which distinguished it from all other printing presses. The ornamentation consisted of a cast-iron character of Hermes on each pillar, alligators and other reptiles on the levers, and, above the structure featured an American spread eagle, which also functioned as a counterweight which lifted the platen after printing. Clymer&#x27;s exceptional printing presses were unique in their design and ease of operation and were naturally desired by many American printers, however, most could not afford his asking price of $400, so in 1817 Clymer took his press to England, where it was immediately well received, while competing in the European market with the Stanhope press, and later with the Albion press.. The Columbian press remained popular for many years, with Clymer receiving a gold medal from the King of the Netherlands for its design, and following the introduction of his press in Russia he also received a present from Alexander I, the Czar of Russia.

Clymer&#x27;s Columbian Press was inspired in part by the earlier English Stanhope press. Because most of the printers in America were not as yet established and could not afford Clymer&#x27;s more expensive printing press he found a limited market for it in the United States. In 1830 he took on Samuel Dixon as a business partner, and they subsequently relocated their company to 10 Finsbury Street in Philadelphia and did business under the name of Clymer and Dixon. His first printing presses made in England had his own name, but by 1825 the company and printing presses displayed both names. After 1813, Clymer, along with Ramage, became major sources for the needs of the early American printer.

==Final years and legacy==
Clymer made a success of his press-manufacturing business, and spent the rest of his life in England. Although he had made and sold several dozen presses in Philadelphia, there are no surviving American Columbian printing presses. Though they were not exactly the same in design, the Leggett &#x27;Queen&#x27; press, made in Ipswich, and the Britannia press, made in Leeds were designed after Clymer&#x27;s Columbian press. The Albion press was also designed as a way of upstaging Clymer&#x27;s elaborately designed and prestigious press; though the Albion was initially less decorative, an ornate casting of the English royal arms was eventually added as a counterweight, paralleling the iconic and stately spread-eagle counterweight on the Columbian.

While in London Clymer manufactured his printing presses in sizes between what was referred to as &quot;Super Royal&quot; and &quot;Double Royal&quot;. They sold for £100, and £125 respectively, with variant press sizes and prices in between. In 1820 England saw a depression which adversely effected business sales and subsequently Clymer was compelled to make significant reductions in his asking prices, ranging from £75 to £85.

In 1819 the image of Clymer&#x27;s printing press was used by the Columbia Typographical Society in Washington D.C., a local union of journeyman printers, as the emblem for their organization, as it represented their republican sentiments in the political realm while also serving as a symbol of national pride in the American printing trade.

A rare early press, currently located at Historic Richmond Town, has been tentatively attributed by historians as the only known press made by Clymer prior to his 1813 design for the Columbian Press.

During the 1800s Clymer&#x27;s presses were commonly employed in European printing offices. Today they are often found in various European museums. 

Clymer died in London in 1834 at the age of eighty. Out of several children he was survived by three daughters. After his death the Columbian Press continued to be sold by the firm he had established, and it was also made by other manufacturers in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe up until 1913.
