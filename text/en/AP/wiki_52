<text>In chess, an irregular opening is an opening considered unusual or unorthodox. In the early 19th century the term was used for any opening not beginning with 1.e4 e5 (the Open Game) or 1.d4 d5 (the Closed Game). As opening theory has developed and openings formerly considered &quot;irregular&quot; have become standard, the term has been used less frequently.

Because these openings are not popular with chess players, the standard opening references such as &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot; (MCO) and &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; (ECO) do not cover them in detail.

==Usage of the term==
While the term has frequently been used in chess literature, its meaning has never been precise and has varied between writers.

One of the earliest references to &quot;irregular openings&quot; in chess literature was made by William Lewis in his 1832 work &quot;Second Series of Lessons on the Game of Chess&quot;. Lewis classified openings under the headings &quot;King&#x27;s Bishop&#x27;s Game&quot; (1.e4 e5 2.Bc4), &quot;King&#x27;s Knight&#x27;s Game&quot; (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3), &quot;Queen&#x27;s Bishop&#x27;s Pawn Game&quot; (1.e4 e5 2.c3), &quot;King&#x27;s Gambit&quot; (1.e4 e5 2.f4), &quot;Queen&#x27;s Gambit&quot; (1.d4 d5 2.c4) and &quot;Irregular Openings&quot; (all other openings). Lewis comments that the irregular openings are &quot;seldom played, because they are generally dull and uninteresting&quot;. Among the openings he analyzes under this heading are the French Defence and English Opening (both now considered standard), Bird&#x27;s Opening and a few 1.d4 d5 lines without the Queen&#x27;s Gambit. Lewis assigns no names to these openings.

Carl Jaenisch, who was an early advocate of the French and Sicilian defences, rejected this use of the term &quot;irregular&quot;, saying that openings should rather be classified as &quot;correct&quot;, &quot;incorrect&quot; or &quot;hazardous&quot;. In &quot;The Chess-Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (1847), for many years the standard English-language reference book on the game of chess, Howard Staunton accepted Lewis&#x27;s overall classification system while tacitly acknowledging Jaenisch&#x27;s objections. He wrote &quot;Those methods of commencing the game, in which the first or second player moves other than (1.e4 e5 or 1.d4 d5) are usually designated &quot;Irregular&quot;. Without assenting to the propriety of this distinction, I have thought it advisable, for the sake of perspicuity, to adopt a general and well known classification in preference to arranging these peculiar &quot;débuts&quot; under separate and less familiar heads.&quot; Under this heading, Staunton considers the French Defence, Sicilian Defence, Scandinavian Defence, Owen&#x27;s Defence, Dutch Defence, Benoni Defence, Bird&#x27;s Opening and English Opening.

==Strategic considerations==

Irregular openings are usually considered somewhat weaker than standard openings if both players play &quot;perfectly&quot;. An element that many irregular openings share in common to their favor, however, is that many players have not studied the resulting positions in depth. As such, they can be a useful tool when played intentionally, similar to chess traps, to throw the other player off their preferred openings they&#x27;ve prepared for and played many times, and force the game onto a path that only the irregular opening player has studied. This advantage can offset the theoretical weakness; even if the other player avoids any direct blunders, they may be forced to spend time deriving the correct move through personal analysis, rather than instantly knowing the &quot;correct&quot; reply from a memorized opening book. In the same way, such strategies could be effective against older and weaker computer chess programs from the 1980s and 1990s: a chess program that heavily relied on memorized opening books from games of top players could be set adrift quickly by an irregular opening, and forced to calculate moves for itself. Such tactics no longer work on modern chess programs, however, which are significantly stronger.

==Examples==

===Unusual first moves by White===
The vast majority of high-level chess games begin with either 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.Nf3, or 1.c4. Also seen occasionally are 1.g3, 1.b3, and 1.f4. Other opening moves by White, along with a few non-transposing lines beginning 1.g3, are classified under the code &quot;A00&quot; by the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; and described as &quot;uncommon&quot; or &quot;irregular&quot;. Although they are classified under a single code, these openings are unrelated to each other.

The openings classified as A00 are:
*1. – Anderssen&#x27;s Opening
*1. – Ware Opening
*1. – Sokolsky Opening, also known as the Polish Opening or Orangutan Opening
*1. – Saragossa Opening
*1. – Mieses Opening
*1. – Van &#x27;t Kruijs Opening
*1. – Barnes Opening, also known as Gedult&#x27;s Opening
*1. – King&#x27;s Fianchetto Opening or Benko&#x27;s Opening
*1. – Grob&#x27;s Attack
*1. – Clemenz Opening, or Basman&#x27;s Attack
*1. – Desprez Opening, or Kadas Opening
*1. – Durkin Opening, also known as Durkin&#x27;s Attack or the Sodium Attack
*1. – Dunst Opening
*1. – Amar Opening, also known as the Paris Opening, Ammonia Opening, or Drunken Knight Opening

The Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack (1.b3, ECO code A01) and Bird&#x27;s Opening (1.f4, ECO codes A02–A03) have also been described as &quot;irregular&quot;, particularly in older books.

===Unusual responses by Black===
Openings in which Black makes an unconventional response to 1.e4 are classified as B00 (King&#x27;s Pawn Game). Included in this code are:
*1.e4 a6 – St. George Defence
*1.e4 b6 – Owen&#x27;s Defence
*1.e4 f6 – Barnes Defence
*1.e4 h6 – Carr Defence
*1.e4 Na6 – Lemming Defence
*1.e4 Nc6 – Nimzowitsch Defence
*1.e4 Nh6 – Adams Defence
*1.e4 a5 – Cornstalk Defence
*1.e4 b5 – O&#x27;Neill Gambit (loses pawn to 2. Bxb5)
*1.e4 f5 – Fred Defence
*1.e4 g5 – Borg Defence
*1.e4 h5 – Goldsmith Defence

Of these, 1...Nc6, 1...b6, 1...a6, and 1...g5 have received the most theoretical attention. Tony Miles famously used 1...a6 to defeat Anatoly Karpov.

<text>The Sokolsky Opening, also known as the Orangutan and the Polish Opening, is an uncommon chess opening that begins with the move:
: 1. 

According to various databases, out of the twenty possible first moves from White, the move 1.b4 ranks ninth in popularity. It is considered an irregular opening, so it is classified under the A00 code in the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot;.
==Origins==
One of the earliest opening plays of b4 was by Bernhard Fleissig playing against Carl Schlechter in 1893, although Fleissig was handily defeated in just 18 moves. Nikolai Bugaev defeated former world champion Wilhelm Steinitz with it in a simul exhibition game, and later published an analysis of the opening in 1903 in a Russian magazine article. Savielly Tartakower defeated Richard Réti using b4 in a match in 1919 when both were top-level players, and Reti himself defeated Abraham Speijer in Scheveningen 1923 using the opening.

The most famous use came in a game between Tartakower and Géza Maróczy at the New York 1924 chess tournament on March 21, 1924. The name &quot;The Orangutan&quot; originates from that game: the players visited the Bronx Zoo the previous day, where Tartakower consulted an orangutan named Susan. She somehow indicated, Tartakower insisted, that he should open with b4. Also, Tartakower was impressed with the climbing skills of the orangutan, and thought that the &quot;climb&quot; of the b-pawn was similar. In that particular game, Tartakower came out of the opening with a decent position, but the game was ultimately drawn. 

The opening received sporadic play in the decades that followed. Tartakower had more success in 1926 when he used it against Edgard Colle for a victory. One of the most notable proponents was the Soviet player Alexei Pavlovich Sokolsky (1908–1969), who often used it in high-level play. Sokolsky wrote a monograph on the opening in 1963, &quot;Debyut 1 b2–b4&quot;, which would lead to the opening being called the &quot;Sokolsky Opening&quot;. Sokolsky&#x27;s work defended the viability of the opening even at the highest levels of professional play.

The final term, and the one used in contemporary books and chess websites such as Chess.com and Lichess, is the Polish Opening. This is by analogy to the Polish Defense (1. d4 b5), where Black&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Knight pawn is advanced two spaces.

==Notable later usage==
In general, the opening is not popular at the top level. Alexander Alekhine, who played in the same 1924 New York tournament as Tartakower and the Orangutan game, wrote that the problem is that it reveals White&#x27;s intentions before White knows what Black&#x27;s intentions are. That said, it still sees sporadic use among top level grandmasters. Boris Spassky used it against Vasily Smyslov in a 1960 match, albeit having to settle for a draw. In May 2021, world champion Magnus Carlsen essayed the opening against GMs Hikaru Nakamura and Wesley So in the online FTX Crypto Cup rapid tournament.

==Details==

The opening is largely based upon tactics on the or the f6- and g7-squares. Black can respond in a variety of ways: For example, a common response is for Black to make a claim on the , which White&#x27;s first move ignores, with 1...e5 (it is normal for White to ignore the attack on the b-pawn and play 2.Bb2, where 2...d6, 2...f6, and 2...Bxb4 are all playable), 1...d5 (possibly followed by 2.Bb2 Qd6, attacking b4 and supporting ...e7–e5), or 1...f5. Less ambitious moves like 1...Nf6, 1...c6 (called the Outflank Variation, preparing ...Qb6 or ...a5), and 1...e6 are also reasonable. Rarer attempts have been made with 1...a5 or 1...c5. Black&#x27;s reply 1...e6 is usually followed by ...d5, ...Nf6 and an eventual ...c5. After 1...a5 White will most likely play 2.b5 and take advantage of Black&#x27;s queenside weakness. Black&#x27;s 1...c5 is much sharper and more aggressive and is normally used to avoid theory. After the capture Black will generally place pressure on the c5-square and will develop an attack against White&#x27;s weak queenside structure at the cost of an inferior central position.

<text>Halvergate is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk, north of Reedham, between the Rivers Bure and Yare, within The Broads. To the east of the village is the hamlet of Wickhampton and the Halvergate Marshes, an area of drainage marsh which was the site of the first Environmentally Sensitive Area in the United Kingdom in 1987.

The villages name origin is uncertain possibly, &#x27;land costing half a heriot&#x27;.

The parish covers an area of and had a population of 468 in 202 households at the 2001 census, increasing to a population of 607 in 243 households at the 2011 Census. For the purposes of local government, it falls within the district of Broadland. The civil parish includes the village of Tunstall.

The long distance footpath named the Weavers&#x27; Way passes through Halvergate, and this provides one of the few modes of access to Berney Arms.

The village has a cricket team that plays in the East Anglian Premier League.

<doc id="100031" wikidata="Q41408" url="?curid=100031" title="Federico García Lorca">
<text>Federico del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús García Lorca (5 June 1898 – 19 August 1936) was a Spanish poet, playwright, and theatre director. García Lorca achieved international recognition as an emblematic member of the Generation of &#x27;27, a group consisting mostly of poets who introduced the tenets of European movements (such as symbolism, futurism, and surrealism) into Spanish literature.

He initially rose to fame with &quot;Romancero gitano&quot; (&quot;Gypsy Ballads&quot;, 1928), a book of poems depicting life in his native Andalusia. His poetry incorporated traditional Andalusian motifs and avant-garde styles. After a sojourn in New York City from 1929 to 1930—documented posthumously in &quot;Poeta en Nueva York&quot; (&quot;Poet in New York&quot;, 1942)—he returned to Spain and wrote his best-known plays, &quot;Blood Wedding&quot; (1932), &quot;Yerma&quot; (1934), and &quot;The House of Bernarda Alba&quot; (1936).

García Lorca was homosexual and suffered from depression after the end of his relationship with sculptor Emilio Aladrén Perojo. García Lorca also had a close emotional relationship for a time with Salvador Dalí, who said he rejected García Lorca&#x27;s sexual advances. 

García Lorca was assassinated by Nationalist forces at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. His remains have never been found, and the motive remains in dispute; some theorize he was targeted for being gay, a socialist, or both, while others view a personal dispute as the more likely cause.

==Life and career==
===Early years===

Federico del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús García Lorca was born on 5 June 1898, in Fuente Vaqueros, a small town 17 km west of Granada, southern Spain. His father, Federico García Rodríguez, was a prosperous landowner with a farm in the fertile &quot;vega&quot; (valley) near Granada and a comfortable villa in the heart of the city. García Rodríguez saw his fortunes rise with a boom in the sugar industry. García Lorca&#x27;s mother, Vicenta Lorca Romero, was a teacher. In 1905 the family moved from Fuente Vaqueros to the nearby town of Valderrubio (at the time named Asquerosa). In 1909, when the boy was 11, his family moved to the regional capital of Granada, where there was the equivalent of a high school; their best-known residence there is the summer home called the Huerta de San Vicente, on what were then the outskirts of the city of Granada. For the rest of his life, he maintained the importance of living close to the natural world, praising his upbringing in the country. All three of these homes—Fuente Vaqueros, Valderrubio, and Huerta de San Vicente—are today museums.
In 1915, after graduating from secondary school, García Lorca attended the University of Granada. During this time his studies included law, literature, and composition. Throughout his adolescence, he felt a deeper affinity for music than for literature. When he was 11 years old, he began six years of piano lessons with Antonio Segura Mesa, a harmony teacher in the local conservatory and a composer. It was Segura who inspired Federico&#x27;s dream of a career in music. His first artistic inspirations arose from scores by Claude Debussy, Frédéric Chopin and Ludwig van Beethoven. Later, with his friendship with composer Manuel de Falla, Spanish folklore became his muse. García Lorca did not turn to writing until Segura&#x27;s death in 1916, and his first prose works, such as &quot;Nocturne&quot;, &quot;Ballade&quot;, and &quot;Sonata&quot;, drew on musical forms. His milieu of young intellectuals gathered in El Rinconcillo at the Café Alameda in Granada. In 1916 and 1917, García Lorca travelled throughout Castile, León, and Galicia, in northern Spain, with a professor of his university, who also encouraged him to write his first book, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Impressions and Landscapes&quot;—printed at his father&#x27;s expense in 1918). Fernando de los Rios persuaded García Lorca&#x27;s parents to let him move to the progressive, Oxbridge-inspired Residencia de Estudiantes in Madrid in 1919, while nominally attending classes at the University of Madrid.

===As a young writer===
At the Residencia de Estudiantes in Madrid, García Lorca befriended Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí and many other creative artists who were, or would become, influential across Spain. He was taken under the wing of the poet Juan Ramón Jiménez, becoming close to playwright Eduardo Marquina and Gregorio Martínez Sierra, the Director of Madrid&#x27;s Teatro Eslava.

In 1919–20, at Sierra&#x27;s invitation, he wrote and staged his first play, &quot;The Butterfly&#x27;s Evil Spell&quot;. It was a verse play dramatising the impossible love between a cockroach and a butterfly, with a supporting cast of other insects; it was laughed off the stage by an unappreciative public after only four performances and influenced García Lorca&#x27;s attitude to the theatre-going public for the rest of his career. He would later claim that &quot;Mariana Pineda&quot;, written in 1927, was, in fact, his first play. During his time at the Residencia de Estudiantes, he pursued degrees in law and philosophy, though he had more interest in writing than in study.

García Lorca&#x27;s first book of poems, &quot;Libro de poemas&quot;, was published in 1921, collecting work written from 1918, and selected with the help of his brother Francisco (nicknamed Paquito). They concern the themes of religious faith, isolation, and nature that had filled his prose reflections. Early in 1922, at Granada García Lorca joined the composer Manuel de Falla in order to promote the Concurso de Cante Jondo, a festival dedicated to enhancing flamenco performance and its cante jondo style. The year before, García Lorca had begun to write his &quot;&quot; (&quot;Poem of the Deep Song&quot;, not published until 1931), so he naturally composed an essay on the art of flamenco, and began to speak publicly in support of the &quot;Concurso&quot;. At the music festival in June, he met the celebrated Manuel Torre, a flamenco &quot;cantaor&quot;. The next year in Granada he also collaborated with Falla and others on the musical production of a play for children, &quot;La niña que riega la albahaca y el príncipe preguntón&quot; (&quot;The Girl that Waters the Basil and the Inquisitive Prince&quot;) adapted by Lorca from an Andalusian story. Inspired by the same structural form of sequence as &quot;Deep Song&quot;, his collection &quot;Suites&quot; (1923) was never finished and was not published until 1983.

Over the next few years, García Lorca became increasingly involved in Spain&#x27;s avant-garde. He published a poetry collection called &quot;Canciones&quot; (&quot;Songs&quot;), although it did not contain songs in the usual sense. Shortly after, Lorca was invited to exhibit a series of drawings at the Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona, from 25 June to 2 July 1927. Lorca&#x27;s sketches were a blend of popular and avant-garde styles, complementing &quot;Canción&quot;. Both his poetry and drawings reflected the influence of traditional Andalusian motifs, Cubist syntax, and a preoccupation with sexual identity. Several drawings consisted of superimposed dreamlike faces (or shadows). He later described the double faces as self-portraits, showing &quot;man&#x27;s capacity for crying as well as winning,&quot; in line with his conviction that sorrow and joy were as inseparable as life and death.

&quot;Romancero gitano&quot; (&quot;Gypsy Ballads&quot;, 1928), part of his Cancion series, became his best-known book of poetry. It was a highly stylised imitation of the ballads and poems that were still being told throughout the Spanish countryside. García Lorca describes the work as a &quot;carved altar piece&quot; of Andalusia with &quot;gypsies, horses, archangels, planets, its Jewish and Roman breezes, rivers, crimes, the everyday touch of the smuggler and the celestial note of the naked children of Córdoba. A book that hardly expresses visible Andalusia at all, but where the hidden Andalusia trembles.&quot; In 1928, the book brought him fame across Spain and the Hispanic world, and it was only much later that he gained notability as a playwright. For the rest of his life, the writer would search for the elements of Andaluce culture, trying to find its essence without resorting to the &quot;picturesque&quot; or the clichéd use of &quot;local colour&quot;.

His second play, &quot;Mariana Pineda&quot;, with stage settings by Salvador Dalí, opened to great acclaim in Barcelona in 1927. In 1926, García Lorca wrote the play &quot;The Shoemaker&#x27;s Prodigious Wife&quot;, which would not be shown until the early 1930s. It was a farce about fantasy, based on the relationship between a flirtatious, petulant wife and a hen-pecked shoemaker.From 1925 to 1928, he was passionately involved with Dalí. Although Dali&#x27;s friendship with Lorca had a strong element of mutual passion, Dalí said he rejected the erotic advances of the poet. With the success of &quot;Gypsy Ballads&quot;, came an estrangement from Dalí and the breakdown of a love affair with sculptor Emilio Aladrén Perojo. These brought on an increasing depression, a situation exacerbated by his anguish over his homosexuality. He felt he was trapped between the persona of the successful author, which he was forced to maintain in public, and the tortured, authentic self, which he could acknowledge only in private. He also had the sense that he was being pigeon-holed as a &quot;gypsy poet&quot;. He wrote: &quot;The gypsies are a theme. And nothing more. I could just as well be a poet of sewing needles or hydraulic landscapes. Besides, this gypsyism gives me the appearance of an uncultured, ignorant and primitive poet that you know very well I&#x27;m not. I don&#x27;t want to be typecast.&quot;

Growing estrangement between García Lorca and his closest friends reached its climax when surrealists Dalí and Luis Buñuel collaborated on their 1929 film &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; (&quot;An Andalusian Dog&quot;). García Lorca interpreted it, perhaps erroneously, as a vicious attack upon himself. At this time Dalí also met his future wife Gala. Aware of these problems (though not perhaps of their causes), García Lorca&#x27;s family arranged for him to make a lengthy visit to the United States in 1929–30.

In June 1929, García Lorca travelled to the US with Fernando de los Rios on the RMS &quot;Olympic&quot;, a sister liner to the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. They stayed mostly in New York City, where Rios started a lecture tour and García Lorca enrolled at Columbia University School of General Studies, funded by his parents. He studied English but, as before, was absorbed more by writing than by study. At Columbia, he lived in room 617 in Furnald Hall before moving to room 1231 in John Jay Hall. He also spent time in Vermont and later in Havana, Cuba.

His collection &quot;Poeta en Nueva York&quot; (&quot;Poet in New York&quot;, published posthumously in 1940) explores alienation and isolation through some graphically experimental poetic techniques and was influenced by the Wall Street crash which he personally witnessed.

This condemnation of urban capitalist society and materialistic modernity was a sharp departure from his earlier work and label as a folklorist. His play of this time, &quot;El público&quot; (&quot;The Public&quot;), was not published until the late 1970s and has never been published in its entirety, the complete manuscript apparently lost. However, the Hispanic Society of America in New York City retains several of his personal letters.

===The Second Republic===
García Lorca&#x27;s return to Spain in 1930 coincided with the fall of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera and the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic. In 1931, García Lorca was appointed director of a student theatre company, Teatro Universitario La Barraca (The Shack). It was funded by the Second Republic&#x27;s Ministry of Education, and it was charged with touring Spain&#x27;s rural areas in order to introduce audiences to classical Spanish theatre free of charge. With a portable stage and little equipment, they sought to bring theatre to people who had never seen any, with García Lorca directing as well as acting. He commented: &quot;Outside of Madrid, the theatre, which is in its very essence a part of the life of the people, is almost dead, and the people suffer accordingly, as they would if they had lost their two eyes, or ears, or a sense of taste. We [La Barraca] are going to give it back to them.&quot; His experiences travelling through impoverished rural Spain and New York (particularly amongst the disenfranchised African-American population), transformed him into a passionate advocate of the theatre of social action. He wrote &quot;The theatre is a school of weeping and of laughter, a free forum, where men can question norms that are outmoded or mistaken and explain with living example the eternal norms of the human heart.&quot;

While touring with &quot;La Barraca&quot;, García Lorca wrote his now best-known plays, the &quot;Rural Trilogy&quot; of &quot;Blood Wedding&quot;, &quot;Yerma&quot; and &quot;The House of Bernarda Alba&quot;, which all rebelled against the norms of bourgeois Spanish society. He called for a rediscovery of the roots of European theatre and the questioning of comfortable conventions such as the popular drawing-room comedies of the time. His work challenged the accepted role of women in society and explored taboo issues of homoeroticism and class. García Lorca wrote little poetry in this last period of his life, declaring in 1936, &quot;theatre is poetry that rises from the book and becomes human enough to talk and shout, weep and despair.&quot;

Travelling to Buenos Aires in 1933, to give lectures and direct the Argentine premiere of &quot;Blood Wedding&quot;, García Lorca spoke of his distilled theories on artistic creation and performance in the famous lecture &quot;Play and Theory of the Duende&quot;. This attempted to define a schema of artistic inspiration, arguing that great art depends upon a vivid awareness of death, connection with a nation&#x27;s soil, and an acknowledgement of the limitations of reason.

As well as returning to the classical roots of theatre, García Lorca also turned to traditional forms in poetry. His last poetic work, &quot;Sonetos de amor oscuro&quot; (&quot;Sonnets of Dark Love&quot;, 1936), was long thought to have been inspired by his passion for Rafael Rodríguez Rapún, young actor and secretary of La Barraca. Documents and mementos revealed in 2012, suggest that the actual inspiration was Juan Ramírez de Lucas, a 19-year-old with whom Lorca hoped to emigrate to Mexico. The love sonnets are inspired by the 16th-century poet San Juan de la Cruz. La Barraca&#x27;s subsidy was cut in half by the rightist government elected in 1934, and its last performance was given in April 1936.

Lorca spent summers at the Huerta de San Vicente from 1926 to 1936. Here he wrote, totally or in part, some of his major works, among them &quot;When Five Years Pass&quot; (&quot;Así que pasen cinco años&quot;) (1931), &quot;Blood Wedding&quot; (1932), &quot;Yerma&quot; (1934) and &quot;Diván del Tamarit&quot; (1931–1936). The poet lived in the Huerta de San Vicente in the days just before his arrest and assassination in August 1936.

Although García Lorca&#x27;s drawings do not often receive attention, he was also a talented artist.

==Assassination==
Political and social tensions had greatly intensified after the July 1936 murder of prominent monarchist and anti-Popular Front spokesman José Calvo Sotelo by Republican Assault Guards (Guardias de asalto). García Lorca knew that he would be considered abhorrent by the rising right wing for his outspoken socialist views. Granada was so tumultuous that it had not had a mayor for months; no one dared accept the job. When García Lorca&#x27;s brother-in-law, Manuel Fernández-Montesinos, agreed to accept the position, he was assassinated within a week. On the same day he was shot, 19 August 1936, García Lorca was arrested.

It is thought that García Lorca was shot and killed by Nationalist militia on 19 August 1936. The author Ian Gibson in his book &quot;The Assassination of García Lorca&quot; argues that he was shot with three others (Joaquín Arcollas Cabezas, Francisco Galadí Melgar and Dióscoro Galindo González) at a place known as the Fuente Grande (&#x27;Great Spring&#x27;) which is on the road between Víznar and Alfacar. Police reports released by radio station Cadena SER in April 2015, conclude that Lorca was executed by fascist forces. The Franco-era report, dated 9 July 1965, describes the writer as a &quot;socialist&quot; and &quot;freemason belonging to the Alhambra lodge&quot;, who engaged in &quot;homosexual and abnormal practices&quot;.

Significant controversy exists about the motives and details of García Lorca&#x27;s murder. Personal, non-political motives have been suggested. García Lorca&#x27;s biographer, Stainton, states that his killers made remarks about his sexual orientation, suggesting that it played a role in his death. Ian Gibson suggests that García Lorca&#x27;s assassination was part of a campaign of mass killings intended to eliminate supporters of the Leftist Popular Front. However, Gibson proposes that rivalry between the right-wing Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA) and the fascist Falange was a major factor in Lorca&#x27;s death. At the time of his arrest, Lorca was hiding in the house of Luis Rosales, two of whose brothers were high-ranking Falange members. Former CEDA Parliamentary Deputy Ramón Ruiz Alonso arrested García Lorca at the Rosales&#x27;s home, and was the one responsible for the original denunciation that led to the arrest warrant&#x27;s being issued.

It has been argued that García Lorca was apolitical and had many friends in both Republican and Nationalist camps. Gibson disputes this in his 1978 book about the poet&#x27;s death. He cites, for example, &quot;Mundo Obrero&quot;″s published manifesto, which Lorca later signed, and alleges that García Lorca was an active supporter of the Popular Front. García Lorca read out this manifesto at a banquet in honour of fellow poet Rafael Alberti on 9 February 1936.

Many anti-communists were sympathetic to García Lorca or assisted him. In the days before his arrest, he found shelter in the house of the artist and leading Falange member, Luis Rosales. Evidence suggests that Rosales was very nearly shot as well by the Civil Governor Valdés for helping García Lorca. Poet Gabriel Celaya wrote in his memoirs that he once found García Lorca in the company of Falangist José Maria Aizpurúa. Celaya further wrote that Lorca dined every Friday with Falangist founder and leader José Antonio Primo de Rivera. On 11 March 1937, an article appeared in the Falangist press denouncing the murder and lionizing García Lorca; the article opened: &quot;The finest poet of Imperial Spain has been assassinated.&quot; Jean-Louis Schonberg also put forward the &#x27;homosexual jealousy&#x27; theory.

==Search for remains==

The later 20th, and particularly the 21st centuries have seen numerous, unsuccessful attempts to locate García Lorca&#x27;s remains. The first published account is in a 1949 book by the British Hispanist Gerald Brenan, &quot;The Face of Spain&quot;. By the 21st century advances in technology gave scope for identifying remains of victims of Francoist repression. The year 2000 saw the foundation of the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory, which grew out of the quest by a sociologist, Emilio Silva-Barrera, to locate and identify the remains of his grandfather, who was shot by Franco&#x27;s forces in 1936.

Three efforts have been made in the 21st century to locate García Lorca&#x27;s body. The first, in 2009, in the García Lorca Memorial Park; the second, in 2014, less than a kilometre from the first excavation, and the last, in 2016, in Alfacar. In 2008, a Spanish judge opened an investigation into García Lorca&#x27;s death. The García Lorca family dropped objections to the excavation of a potential gravesite near Alfacar, but no human remains were found. The investigation was ultimately dropped and a further investigation was begun in 2016, but met with no more success. 

In late October 2009, a team of archaeologists and historians from the University of Granada began excavations outside Alfacar. The site was identified three decades previously by a man who said he had helped dig Lorca&#x27;s grave. Lorca was thought to be buried with at least three other men beside a winding mountain road that connects the villages of Víznar and Alfacar.

The excavations began at the request of another victim&#x27;s family. Following a long-standing objection, the Lorca family also gave their permission. In October 2009, Francisco Espínola, a spokesman for the Justice Ministry of the Andalusian regional government, said that after years of pressure, García Lorca&#x27;s body would &quot;be exhumed in a matter of weeks.&quot; Lorca&#x27;s relatives, who had initially opposed an exhumation, said they might provide a DNA sample in order to identify his remains.

In late November 2009, after two weeks of excavating the site, organic material that was believed to be human bones was recovered. The remains were taken to the University of Granada for examination. But in mid-December 2009, doubts were raised as to whether the poet&#x27;s remains would be found. The dig produced &quot;not one bone, item of clothing or bullet shell&quot;, said Begoña Álvarez, justice minister of Andalucia. She added, &quot;the soil was only 40 cm (16in) deep, making it too shallow for a grave.&quot; The failed excavation cost €70,000.

In January 2012, a local historian, Miguel Caballero Pérez, author of &quot;The last 13 hours of García Lorca&quot;, applied for permission to excavate another area less than half a kilometre from the site, where he believes Lorca&#x27;s remains are located.

Claims in 2016, by Stephen Roberts, an associate professor in Spanish literature at Nottingham University, and others that the poet&#x27;s body was buried in a well in Alfacar have not been substantiated.

In 2021, it was reported that there would be an investigation of mass graves at Barranco de Víznar (a locality near Víznar where there is a memorial to Lorca). This project had the support of families who believed that relatives were buried there. The archaeologist directing the investigation explained that the poet was only one of hundreds of people whose remains might be there. Excavations at the site were still in progress in 2024.

==Censorship==

Francisco Franco&#x27;s regime placed a general ban on García Lorca&#x27;s work, which was not rescinded until 1953. That year, a (censored) &quot;Obras completas&quot; (&quot;Complete Works&quot;) was released. Following this, &quot;Blood Wedding&quot;, &quot;Yerma&quot; and &quot;The House of Bernarda Alba&quot; were successfully played on the main Spanish stages. &quot;Obras completas&quot; did not include his late heavily homoerotic &quot;Sonnets of Dark Love&quot;, written in November 1935 and shared only with close friends. They were lost until 1983/4 when they were finally published in draft form. (No final manuscripts have ever been found.) It was only after Franco&#x27;s death that García Lorca&#x27;s life and death could be openly discussed in Spain. This was not only because of political censorship, but also because of the reluctance of the García Lorca family to allow the publication of unfinished poems and plays prior to the publication of a critical edition of his works.

South African Roman Catholic poet Roy Campbell, who enthusiastically supported the Nationalists both during and after the Civil War, later produced acclaimed translations of Lorca&#x27;s work. In his poem &quot;The Martyrdom of F. Garcia Lorca&quot;, Campbell wrote,

&lt;poem&gt;
Not only did he lose his life
By shots assassinated:
But with a hammer and a knife
Was after that—translated.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Memorials==

In Granada, the city of his birth, the Park Federico García Lorca is dedicated to his memory and includes the Huerta de San Vicente, the Lorca family summer home, opened as a museum in 1995. The grounds, including nearly two hectares of land, the two adjoining houses, works of art, and the original furnishings have been preserved. There is a statue of Lorca on the Avenida de la Constitución in the city centre, and a cultural centre bearing his name was opened in 2015.

The Parque Federico García Lorca, in Alfacar, is near Fuente Grande; in 2009, excavations in it failed to locate Lorca&#x27;s body. Close to the olive tree indicated by some as marking the location of the grave, there is a stone memorial to Federico García Lorca and all other victims of the Civil War, 1936–1939. Flowers are laid at the memorial every year on the anniversary of his death, and a commemorative event including music and readings of the poet&#x27;s works is held every year in the park to mark the anniversary. On 17 August 2011, to remember the 75th anniversary of Lorca&#x27;s assassination and to celebrate his life and legacy, this event included dance, song, poetry and dramatic readings and attracted hundreds of spectators. At the Barranco de Víznar, between Víznar and Alfacar, there is a memorial stone bearing the words &quot;Lorca eran todos, 18-8-2002&quot; (&quot;All were Lorca ...&quot;). The Barranco de Víznar is the site of mass graves and has been proposed as another possible location of the poet&#x27;s remains.
Lorca is honoured by a statue prominently located in Madrid&#x27;s Plaza de Santa Ana. Political philosopher David Crocker reported in 2014 that &quot;the statue, at least, is still an emblem of the contested past: each day, the Left puts a red kerchief on the neck of the statue, and someone from the Right comes later to take it off&quot;. In Paris Lorca is commeorated in the Federico García Lorca Garden on the Seine.

Lorca&#x27;s one-time room at the Hotel Castelar in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he lived for six months in 1933, has been kept as a museum. In 2014, Lorca was one of the inaugural honourees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have &quot;made significant contributions in their fields&quot;. The Indonesian composer Ananda Sukarlan has composed music based on some of his poems in 2016 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of his death, commissioned by the Spanish Embassy in Indonesia and the Ubud Writers &amp; Readers Festival (Bali) where it was premiered by soprano Mariska Setiawan.

The Fundación Federico García Lorca, directed by Lorca&#x27;s niece Laura García Lorca, sponsors the celebration and dissemination of the writer&#x27;s work and is currently building the in Madrid. The Lorca family deposited all Federico documents in their possession with the foundation, which holds them on their behalf.

<text>Military engineering is loosely defined as the art, science, and practice of designing and building military works and maintaining lines of military transport and military communications. Military engineers are also responsible for logistics behind military tactics. Modern military engineering differs from civil engineering. In the 20th and 21st centuries, military engineering also includes CBRN defense and other engineering disciplines such as mechanical and electrical engineering techniques.

According to NATO, &quot;military engineering is that engineer activity undertaken, regardless of component or service, to shape the physical operating environment. Military engineering incorporates support to maneuver and to the force as a whole, including military engineering functions such as engineer support to force protection, counter-improvised explosive devices, environmental protection, engineer intelligence and military search. Military engineering does not encompass the activities undertaken by those &#x27;engineers&#x27; who maintain, repair and operate vehicles, vessels, aircraft, weapon systems and equipment.&quot;

Military engineering is an academic subject taught in military academies or schools of military engineering. The construction and demolition tasks related to military engineering are usually performed by military engineers including soldiers trained as sappers or pioneers. In modern armies, soldiers trained to perform such tasks while well forward in battle and under fire are often called combat engineers.

In some countries, military engineers may also perform non-military construction tasks in peacetime such as flood control and river navigation works, but such activities do not fall within the scope of military engineering.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;engineer&quot; was initially used in the context of warfare, dating back to 1325 when &quot;engine’er&quot; (literally, one who operates an engine) referred to &quot;a constructor of military engines&quot;. In this context, &quot;engine&quot; referred to a military machine, i. e., a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a catapult).

As the design of civilian structures such as bridges and buildings developed as a technical discipline, the term &quot;civil engineering&quot; entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the older discipline. As the prevalence of civil engineering outstripped engineering in a military context and the number of disciplines expanded, the original military meaning of the word &quot;engineering&quot; is now largely obsolete. In its place, the term &quot;military engineering&quot; has come to be used.

==History==

In ancient times, military engineers were responsible for siege warfare and building field fortifications, temporary camps and roads. The most notable engineers of ancient times were the Romans and Chinese, who constructed huge siege-machines (catapults, battering rams and siege towers). The Romans were responsible for constructing fortified wooden camps and paved roads for their legions. Many of these Roman roads are still in use today.

The first civilization to have a dedicated force of military engineering specialists were the Romans, whose army contained a dedicated corps of military engineers known as &quot;architecti&quot;. This group was pre-eminent among its contemporaries. The scale of certain military engineering feats, such as the construction of a double-wall of fortifications long, in just 6 weeks to completely encircle the besieged city of Alesia in 52 B.C.E., is an example. Such military engineering feats would have been completely new, and probably bewildering and demoralizing, to the Gallic defenders. Vitruvius is the best known of these Roman army engineers, due to his writings surviving.

Examples of battles before the early modern period where military engineers played a decisive role include the Siege of Tyre under Alexander the Great, the Siege of Masada by Lucius Flavius Silva as well as the Battle of the Trench under the suggestion of Salman the Persian to dig a trench.

For about 600 years after the fall of the Roman Empire, the practice of military engineering barely evolved in the west. In fact, much of the classic techniques and practices of Roman military engineering were lost. Through this period, the foot soldier (who was pivotal to much of the Roman military engineering capability) was largely replaced by mounted soldiers. It was not until later in the Middle Ages, that military engineering saw a revival focused on siege warfare.

Military engineers planned castles and fortresses. When laying siege, they planned and oversaw efforts to penetrate castle defenses. When castles served a military purpose, one of the tasks of the sappers was to weaken the bases of walls to enable them to be breached before means of thwarting these activities were devised. Broadly speaking, sappers were experts at demolishing or otherwise overcoming or bypassing fortification systems.
With the 14th-century development of gunpowder, new siege engines in the form of cannons appeared. Initially military engineers were responsible for maintaining and operating these new weapons just as had been the case with previous siege engines. In England, the challenge of managing the new technology resulted in the creation of the Office of Ordnance around 1370 in order to administer the cannons, armaments and castles of the kingdom. Both military engineers and artillery formed the body of this organization and served together until the office&#x27;s successor, the Board of Ordnance was disbanded in 1855.

In comparison to older weapons, the cannon was significantly more effective against traditional medieval fortifications. Military engineering significantly revised the way fortifications were built in order to be better protected from enemy direct and plunging shot. The new fortifications were also intended to increase the ability of defenders to bring fire onto attacking enemies. Fort construction proliferated in 16th-century Europe based on the &quot;trace italienne&quot; design.
By the 18th century, regiments of foot (infantry) in the British, French, Prussian and other armies included pioneer detachments. In peacetime these specialists constituted the regimental tradesmen, constructing and repairing buildings, transport wagons, etc. On active service they moved at the head of marching columns with axes, shovels, and pickaxes, clearing obstacles or building bridges to enable the main body of the regiment to move through difficult terrain. The modern Royal Welch Fusiliers and French Foreign Legion still maintain pioneer sections who march at the front of ceremonial parades, carrying chromium-plated tools intended for show only. Other historic distinctions include long work aprons and the right to wear beards. In West Africa, the Ashanti army was accompanied to war by carpenters who were responsible for constructing shelters and blacksmiths who repaired weapons. By the 18th century, sappers were deployed in the Dahomeyan army during assaults against fortifications.

The Peninsular War (1808–14) revealed deficiencies in the training and knowledge of officers and men of the British Army in the conduct of siege operations and bridging. During this war low-ranking Royal Engineers officers carried out large-scale operations. They had under their command working parties of two or three battalions of infantry, two or three thousand men, who knew nothing in the art of siegeworks. Royal Engineers officers had to demonstrate the simplest tasks to the soldiers, often while under enemy fire. Several officers were lost and could not be replaced, and a better system of training for siege operations was required. On 23 April 1812 an establishment was authorised, by Royal Warrant, to teach &quot;Sapping, Mining, and other Military Fieldworks&quot; to the junior officers of the Corps of Royal Engineers and the Corps of Royal Military Artificers, Sappers and Miners.

The first courses at the Royal Engineers Establishment were done on an all ranks basis with the greatest regard to economy. To reduce staff the NCOs and officers were responsible for instructing and examining the soldiers. If the men could not read or write they were taught to do so, and those who could read and write were taught to draw and interpret simple plans. The Royal Engineers Establishment quickly became the centre of excellence for all fieldworks and bridging. Captain Charles Pasley, the director of the Establishment, was keen to confirm his teaching, and regular exercises were held as demonstrations or as experiments to improve the techniques and teaching of the Establishment. From 1833 bridging skills were demonstrated annually by the building of a pontoon bridge across the Medway which was tested by the infantry of the garrison and the cavalry from Maidstone. These demonstrations had become a popular spectacle for the local people by 1843, when 43,000 came to watch a field day laid on to test a method of assaulting earthworks for a report to the Inspector General of Fortifications. In 1869 the title of the Royal Engineers Establishment was changed to &quot;The School of Military Engineering&quot; (SME) as evidence of its status, not only as the font of engineer doctrine and training for the British Army, but also as the leading scientific military school in Europe.
The dawn of the internal combustion engine marked the beginning of a significant change in military engineering. With the arrival of the automobile at the end of the 19th century and heavier than air flight at the start of the 20th century, military engineers assumed a major new role in supporting the movement and deployment of these systems in war. Military engineers gained vast knowledge and experience in explosives. They were tasked with planting bombs, landmines and dynamite.

At the end of World War I, the standoff on the Western Front caused the Imperial German Army to gather experienced and particularly skilled soldiers to form &quot;Assault Teams&quot; which would break through the Allied trenches. With enhanced training and special weapons (such as flamethrowers), these squads achieved some success, but too late to change the outcome of the war. In early WWII, however, the Wehrmacht &quot;Pioniere&quot; battalions proved their efficiency in both attack and defense, somewhat inspiring other armies to develop their own combat engineers battalions. Notably, the attack on Fort Eben-Emael in Belgium was conducted by Luftwaffe glider-deployed combat engineers.

The need to defeat the German defensive positions of the &quot;Atlantic wall&quot; as part of the amphibious landings in Normandy in 1944 led to the development of specialist combat engineer vehicles. These, collectively known as Hobart&#x27;s Funnies, included a specific vehicle to carry combat engineers, the Churchill AVRE. These and other dedicated assault vehicles were organised into the specialised 79th Armoured Division and deployed during Operation Overlord – &#x27;D-Day&#x27;.

Other significant military engineering projects of World War II include Mulberry harbour and Operation Pluto.

Modern military engineering still retains the Roman role of building field fortifications, road paving and breaching terrain obstacles. A notable military engineering task was, for example, breaching the Suez Canal during the Yom Kippur War.

== Education ==
Military engineers can come from a variety of engineering programs. They may be graduates of mechanical, electrical, civil, or industrial engineering.

==Sub-discipline==

Modern military engineering can be divided into three main tasks or fields: combat engineering, strategic support, and ancillary support. Combat engineering is associated with engineering on the battlefield. Combat engineers are responsible for increasing mobility on the front lines of war such as digging trenches and building temporary facilities in war zones. Strategic support is associated with providing service in communication zones such as the construction of airfields and the improvement and upgrade of ports, roads and railways communication. Ancillary support includes provision and distribution of maps as well as the disposal of unexploded warheads. Military engineers construct bases, airfields, roads, bridges, ports, and hospitals. During peacetime before modern warfare, military engineers took the role of civil engineers by participating in the construction of civil-works projects. Nowadays, military engineers are almost entirely engaged in war logistics and preparedness.

== Explosives engineering ==
Explosives are defined as any system that produces rapidly expanding gases in a given volume in a short duration. Specific military engineering occupations also extend to the field of explosives and demolitions and their usage on the battlefield. Explosive devices have been used on the battlefield for several centuries, in numerous operations from combat to area clearance. Earliest known development of explosives can be traced back to 10th-century China where the Chinese are credited with engineering the world&#x27;s first known explosive, black powder. Initially developed for recreational purposes, black powder later was utilized for military application in bombs and projectile propulsion in firearms. Engineers in the military who specialize in this field formulate and design many explosive devices to use in varying operating conditions. Such explosive compounds range from black powder to modern plastic explosives. This particular is commonly listed under the role of combat engineers who demolitions expertise also includes mine and IED detection and disposal. For more information, see Bomb disposal.

==Military engineering by country==
Military engineers are key in all armed forces of the world, and invariably found either closely integrated into the force structure, or even into the combat units of the national troops.

=== Brazil ===

Brazilian Army engineers can be part of the Quadro de Engenheiros Militares, with its members trained or professionalized by the traditional Instituto Militar de Engenharia (IME) &quot;(Military Institute of Engineering)&quot;, or the Arma de Engenharia, with its members trained by the Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras (AMAN) &quot;(Agulhas Negras Military Academy).&quot;

In the Brazil&#x27;s Navy, engineers can occupy the Corpo de Engenheiros da Marinha, the Quadro Complementar de Oficiais da Armada and the Quadro Complementar de Oficiais Fuzileiros Navais. Officers can come from the Centro de Instrução Almirante Wandenkolk (CIAW) &quot;(Admiral Wandenkolk Instruction Center)&quot; and the Escola Naval (EN) &quot;(Naval School)&quot; which, through internal selection of the Navy, finish their graduation at the Universidade de São Paulo (USP) &quot;(University of São Paulo)&quot;.

The Quadro de Oficias Engenheiros of the Brazilian Air Force is occupied by engineers professionalized by Centro de Instrução e Adaptação da Aeronáutica &quot;(CIAAR) (Air Force Instruction and Adaptation Center)&quot; and trained, or specialized, by Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA) &quot;(Aeronautics Institute of Technology).&quot;

=== United Kingdom ===
The Royal School of Military Engineering is the main training establishment for the British Army&#x27;s Royal Engineers. The RSME also provides training for the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, other Arms and Services of the British Army, Other Government Departments, and Foreign and Commonwealth countries as required. These skills provide vital components in the Army&#x27;s operational capability, and Royal Engineers are currently deployed in Afghanistan, Iraq, Cyprus, Bosnia, Kosovo, Kenya, Brunei, Falklands, Belize, Germany and Northern Ireland. Royal Engineers also take part in exercises in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Italy, Egypt, Jordan, Canada, Poland and the United States.

=== United States ===

The prevalence of military engineering in the United States dates back to the American Revolutionary War when engineers would carry out tasks in the U.S. Army. During the war, they would map terrain to and build fortifications to protect troops from opposing forces. The first military engineering organization in the United States was the Army Corps of Engineers. Engineers were responsible for protecting military troops whether using fortifications or designing new technology and weaponry throughout the United States&#x27; history of warfare. The Army originally claimed engineers exclusively, but as the U.S. military branches expanded to the sea and sky, the need for military engineering sects in all branches increased. As each branch of the United States military expanded, technology adapted to fit their respective needs.

<text>Clarence Charles &quot;Ducky&quot; Nash (December 7, 1904 – February 20, 1985) was an American voice actor and impressionist. He is best remembered as the original voice of the Disney cartoon character Donald Duck. He was born in the rural community of Watonga, Oklahoma, and a street in that town is named in his honor. In 1993, he was posthumously made a Disney Legend for his contributions to Walt Disney films.

==Career==
===Radio career===
Nash made a name for himself in the late 1920s as an impressionist for KHJ, a Los Angeles radio station, on their show, &quot;The Merrymakers&quot;. He later was employed by the Adohr Milk Company for publicity purposes. Dubbed &quot;Whistling Clarence, the Adohr Bird Man&quot;, Nash rode the streets with a team of miniature horses and gave treats to the children. In 1932, Nash happened by the Disney Studio with his team of horses, and decided to leave a copy of his Adohr publicity sheet with the receptionist. As it turns out, his name was recognized from a reprise appearance on &quot;The Merrymakers&quot; a few days previous, and Walt Disney had been impressed by Nash&#x27;s vocal skills. He was asked to make an informal audition.

===Donald Duck===
One source indicates Nash auditioned before a casting director for Walt Disney Studios and did a voice impression of a billy goat that Nash had started doing as a child in Watonga. The director then reached for the intercom and told Walt Disney, &quot;I think we have found our duck.&quot; Another version indicates Nash went through several of his voices, and Walt Disney happened by when Nash gave his impersonation of a family of ducks. Disney declared Nash perfect for the role of a talking duck in their upcoming animated short, &quot;The Wise Little Hen&quot;. The duck was Donald Duck, who Nash went on to voice for 51 years, in over 120 shorts and films. The last film to feature Nash&#x27;s famous voice was 1983&#x27;s &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, although he continued to provide Donald&#x27;s voice for commercials, promos, and other miscellaneous material until his death.

As early as 1938, promoters from lecture circuits were approaching him on his unique voice of Donald. Disney reportedly did not like the engagements at first, feeling that a human doing the voice would be spoiling the illusion, but then long after he had second thoughts. In early 1941, Nash was traveling on personal appearance tours sponsored by Disney. During World War II, Nash, with his ventriloquist puppet of Donald, which was built by Disney&#x27;s character modeling department, became a regular performer at USO bond rallies and other events to support the war effort. In the mid-1940s, Roy and Walt approved the Donald puppet and they decided to harness it for the 1944 re-release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. RKO and Disney were unsure how the film would do the second time around at the box office after its initial blockbuster run, so they did a promotional campaign with Disney characters including Nash performing with the Donald puppet. During the promotional period of &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot;, he did multiple radio appearances from May to September 1947, with one of those appearances starring Disney himself. He voiced Donald for 1950s TV commercials.

Nash&#x27;s Donald Duck voice was achieved by what is called buccal speech: an alaryngeal form of vocalization which uses the inner cheek to produce sound rather than the larynx. He first discovered it while trying to mimic his pet goat Mary. In his days before Disney, Nash performed in vaudeville shows where he often spoke in a &quot;nervous baby goat&quot; voice.

Donald Duck became one of the world&#x27;s most famous cartoon characters, in great part due to Nash&#x27;s voice. The voice is distinctive both for its ducklike quality and the fact that it is often very difficult for anybody to understand, especially when Donald flew into a rage (which happened fairly often). To keep Donald&#x27;s voice consistent throughout the world, Nash voiced the character in all foreign languages the Disney shorts were translated to (with the aid of the phonetic alphabet), meaning Donald retained his same level of incoherency all across the globe.

===Other characters===
In addition to Donald&#x27;s voice, Clarence Nash also voiced Donald&#x27;s nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie and his girlfriend Daisy, and Mickey Mouse in &quot;R&#x27;coon Dawg&quot; and &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Party&quot;. He provided the meows and yowls of Figaro the kitten and some donkey brays in &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and in a handful of shorts. He also did some bird sounds in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, voiced a bullfrog in &quot;Bambi&quot; and Mr. Bluebird in &quot;Song of the South&quot;, did some dog sounds in &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; and background bird sounds in &quot;Enchanted Tiki Room&quot;, and voiced Jiminy Cricket for a brief period of time after Cliff Edwards&#x27;s death in 1971.

Nash&#x27;s iconic Donald Duck voice would be impersonated elsewhere in animation, most notably in the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera with the character Little Quacker (voiced by Red Coffey) and Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s Yakky Doodle (voiced by Jimmy Weldon), while Harry E. Lang did Donald Duck-like voices in cartoons at MGM Cartoons and Columbia Pictures, including Tom Cat in the early shorts whenever he hisses. As with most Hanna-Barbera productions, these characters used celebrity impersonations, in these cases an impersonation of Clarence Nash&#x27;s Donald Duck voice. Because both were much similar to Nash&#x27;s voice they were often mistakenly attributed to Nash. Likewise, contrary to popular belief, he did not perform the duck voice for Rick Dees&#x27; &quot;Disco Duck&quot;, which was done by one of Dees&#x27; acquaintances. Nash would also use his duck voice on &quot;The Burns &amp; Allen Show&quot; during the 1940s, playing Gracie&#x27;s pet duck Herman.

Nash appeared as himself in the 1941 film &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot;, which shows how Disney films were produced, and was a contestant on a 1954 episode of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot; and a 1964 episode of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. Nash also appeared as himself in a 1956 episode of &quot;Disneyland&quot; entitled &quot;A Day in the Life of Donald Duck&quot;, in which he interacts with an animated Donald who blames him for his speech problems: the two end up arguing mainly due to Donald&#x27;s short temper. He was also a guest on a 1976 episode of &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;. The 1984 special &quot;Donald Duck&#x27;s 50th Birthday&quot; included several clips from Disney films and &quot;Disneyland&quot; episodes.

===Later years===
When Disney shut down their shorts department in 1962, Nash continued to voice Donald in various projects over the next two decades. In 1971, he retired from Disney and devoted himself to charity work, making personal visits to hospitals and homes and entertaining children with his Donald Duck voice. As he passed the age of 70, he found the harsh voice increasingly straining on his throat and so limited public performances to groups of children. During recording sessions, he would take frequent breaks and drink plenty of water to avoid overexerting himself.

One of Nash&#x27;s final performances was in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1983), which made Donald the only character in the film to be voiced by his original actor. His career at Disney was the subject of the premiere episode of &quot;Disney Family Album&quot;, a 1984 series of documentaries about behind-the-scenes personalities at the studio.

==Personal life==
Nash married Margaret Seamans in 1930, and they were married for over 50 years; they had two daughters, Kay and Peggy.

==Death==

Nash died on February 20, 1985, of leukemia in the Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, at the age of 80 and was interred in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills, Los Angeles, California. The tombstone of the grave he now shares with his wife Margaret Nash depicts a carving of Donald and Daisy Duck holding hands.

==Successor and upcoming biography==
After Nash&#x27;s death, Donald&#x27;s voice has been taken up by Disney animator Tony Anselmo, who was trained under Nash personally. Anselmo is also among the many voiceover artists to have voiced Huey, Dewey and Louie over the years. Later characters whose voices owe considerable credit to Nash&#x27;s duck voice have been voiced by actors such as Jimmy Weldon, Frank Welker, Luba Goy and Red Coffey. The most prominent of these is Weldon&#x27;s Yakky Doodle for Hanna-Barbera.

It was announced in 2020 that Disney historian J.B. Kaufman was working with Margaret Barnes, Nash&#x27;s granddaughter, on a biography of Nash.

<text>The Richmond Football Club, nicknamed the Tigers or colloquially the Tig(e)s, is a professional Australian rules football team competing in the Australian Football League (AFL). Founded in 1885 in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond, the club competed in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) from 1885 to 1907, winning two premierships. Richmond then joined the Victorian Football League (now known as the AFL) from the 1908 season and has since won 13 premierships, most recently in 2020.

From 1885 to 1964, Richmond&#x27;s home ground was the Punt Road Oval, (formerly named Richmond Cricket Ground), which is still utilised as their headquarters, training facility and hosting AFLW and Reserves matches. From the 1965 season to present, the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) has been the club&#x27;s official home ground.

Richmond traditionally wears a black guernsey with a yellow sash. The club song, &quot;We&#x27;re From Tigerland&quot;, is well known for its &quot;yellow and black&quot; refrain.

The club is coached by former Melbourne assistant coach Adem Yze, and is captained by Toby Nankervis. Five Richmond players have been inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame as &quot;Legends&quot; of the sport: Kevin Bartlett, Jack Dyer, Royce Hart, Kevin Sheedy and Ian Stewart

==History==

=== Origins and VFA years (1885–1907) ===

A short-lived football club named Richmond formed in 1860 with Tom Wills, one of the founders of Australian rules football, serving as its inaugural secretary and captain. Wills&#x27; cousin H. C. A. Harrison captained Richmond briefly in the early 1860s before moving to Geelong. This club was disbanded in 1871 and has no continuity to the present club. A number of teams formed in Richmond during the game&#x27;s rapid expansion in the 1870s and early 1880s. However, all played at a junior level and it was considered an anomaly that Richmond, one of Melbourne&#x27;s most prominent suburbs, did not boast a senior side. The wait ended when the Richmond Football Club was officially formed at the Royal Hotel in Richmond on 20 February 1885. A successful application for immediate admission to the Victorian Football Association (VFA) followed. The club shared the Punt Road Oval with the Richmond Cricket Club, one of the strongest cricket clubs in Australia which had been playing on the ground since 1856.

At first the team wore blue guernseys and caps with yellow and black stripes in the style of the Richmond Cricket Club. The football club soon adopted yellow and black as its official colours. From the 1890s the supporters and players were often referred to as &quot;Richmondites&quot; and, according to &quot;The Age&quot; in 1890, &quot;The Leader&quot; in 1899 and former club secretary William Maybury the team were occasionally called &quot;Wasps.&quot; The moniker by which they are now known, the &quot;Tigers&quot;, was first adopted around 1908–10 period through the newspapers &quot;Punch&quot; and &quot;The Richmond Guardian&quot;.

During the late 1880s, Richmond struggled to make an impression in the VFA, and after a promising season in 1888 (when they finished fifth with eleven wins), the club slipped backwards, in the process losing players to more successful sides. As the local economy slipped into severe depression in the early 1890s and the crowds began to dwindle, some of the VFA&#x27;s strongest clubs began to agitate for a reform of the competition. Richmond was not considered part of this elite group, which usually voted as a &quot;bloc&quot; at VFA meetings.

In 1896, Richmond in a match against South Melbourne to protest the umpiring, and later in the season, the Tigers had their half-time score annulled against Essendon when it was discovered that they had too many men on the ground. In the closing three weeks of the season, Richmond&#x27;s cut of the gate takings amounted to just five pounds, and they finished the season with the wooden spoon.
In October 1896, the cabal of six strong clubs broke with the association to form the Victorian Football League (VFL). As a struggling club with a poor following, Richmond was not invited to join the new league. Richmond&#x27;s performances did not immediately improve in the depleted VFA until the turn of the century.

The Tigers were boosted by a significant country recruit in 1901. George &quot;Mallee&quot; Johnson was an instant sensation and the first true star player at the club. Richmond leapt to third place and then in 1902, with Johnson dominating the ruck, Richmond entered the closing weeks of the season neck and neck with Port Melbourne at the head of the ladder, but Port Melbourne faltered against Williamstown to hand Richmond its first flag. Having missed a potential bonanza from a premiership play-off, the VFA decided to emulate the VFL and introduce a finals series in 1903, a fateful decision for the Tigers. After recruiting the competition&#x27;s leading goalkicker, Jack Hutchinson, and finishing the season as minor premier, Richmond lost both finals and were runner-up.

The following season, the club became embroiled in a feud with umpire Allen, whom the Tigers accused of failing to curb field invasions and, in particular, the dubious tactics of arch-rival North Melbourne. In the 10 September 1904 match, during which a significant number of Richmond players sustained serious gashes, and despite the earnest requests of the Richmond players, field umpire Allen refused to exercise his legitimate, official power to check the boots of the North Melbourne players for &quot;spikes&quot; on the soles of their boots. When the two clubs were scheduled to meet in the 1904 VFA Grand Final, Richmond announced that they wouldn&#x27;t play with Allen as umpire. The VFA called Richmond&#x27;s bluff, and appointed Allen as umpire for the match, meaning that the Grand Final was scratched and North Melbourne won the premiership on forfeit.

Richmond were now openly at odds with the VFA, and matters failed to improve in the next few years. The club was campaigning against violence (both on-field and among the crowd), ungentlemanly conduct and poor sportsmanship, issues that plagued the VFA to a far greater extent than the rival VFL since the 1896 split. Richmond cultivated links with some VFL clubs by playing practice matches against them. Richmond knew that they were a major asset to the VFA, had built up a large following and played on one of the best grounds in the competition, where they remained unbeaten for five years. In 1905, Richmond confirmed their status with a second premiership, this time overcoming bitter rivals North Melbourne, &quot;Mallee&quot; Johnson had moved to Carlton, but youngster Charlie Ricketts dominated the season and won plaudits among the pressmen, who voted him the best player in the VFA.

However, Ricketts was also lost to the VFL and injury hit the club hard. In 1906–07, the Tigers played finals without looking likely to win the flag. The club earned a rebuke from the VFA for scheduling a practice match against Geelong before the 1907 season, then went ahead with the commitment and earned further censure. Later in the year it became clear that the VFL wanted to expand its competition and Richmond won a place ahead of North Melbourne, which had been strengthened by an amalgamation with the bankrupt West Melbourne as part of their bid. Richmond were granted admission to the VFL on 18 October 1907.

===Entry into the VFL (1908–1944)===

The first few seasons in the VFL were less than spectacular. Although the club turned up some star players, it let a lot of talent leave and the administration was unstable after George Bennett&#x27;s death at the end of the 1908 season. In 1916, the side won its first wooden spoon while also playing in the finals for the first time – World War I having reduced the competition to just four clubs, finals qualification was automatic.

Finally, in 1919, Richmond made their first Grand Final appearance, losing to Collingwood. Richmond stoked a rivalry with Collingwood by recruiting their former skipper Dan Minogue as playing coach and gained vengeance by beating Collingwood in the 1920 VFL Grand Final to secure a first flag in the big league. This was followed by an even better performance the next year. The only club that continued to beat Richmond on a regular basis was Carlton. Finishing minor premier with only one loss for the season in 1921, Carlton were the hottest premiership favourite, yet Richmond managed to beat them in two classic finals matches played over successive weeks to go back-to-back.
The rest of the decade saw four more Grand Final appearances, all of which would end in frustration. From 1927 to 1929 Richmond became the first club in the VFL to lose three consecutive Grand Finals, all of which were to neighbouring archrivals, Collingwood.
The next VFL flag came in 1932, with Richmond&#x27;s triumph over Carlton in a tough encounter which saw Richmond wingman Alan Geddes play the second half with a broken jaw. Another premiership came in 1934, this time against South Melbourne&#x27;s famed &quot;Foreign Legion&quot;, avenging Richmond&#x27;s loss in the 1933 VFL Grand Final.
Prior to the commencement of the 1940 season, internal problems were brewing between the key personalities at the club. Some felt that the uneven performance of the team was due to Percy Bentley&#x27;s coaching methods, and that he should be replaced. Jack Dyer walked out on the club and threatened to play in the VFA after his father, a committeeman who was involved with the anti-Bentley faction, lost his position at the board elections. Finally, the matter was resolved and Bentley kept his job, while Dyer returned to training on the eve of the season. The problems appeared to have been solved when Richmond won the semi-final against Melbourne to go straight into the 1940 VFL Grand Final. However, Melbourne reversed this result with a crushing win to pinch the premiership. Richmond had been out-thought by their old mentor Frank &#x27;Checker&#x27; Hughes, who had assigned a tagger to negate Dyer. Dyer was furious that Bentley had done nothing to prevent his opponent taking him out of the game. The Richmond committee agreed with this assessment, so when Bentley (after retiring as a player) attempted to negotiate a higher fee to continue his coaching tenure, he was rebuffed. Incensed, Bentley quit Punt Road and moved to Carlton as coach, adding further spice to an already fierce rivalry between the two clubs.

Despite the tribulations created by the Second World War, Richmond was able to maintain a commendable level of consistency on the field. The club had quite a lot of players in reserved occupations who remained at home, while the administration became adept at securing star players who were temporarily in Melbourne on war service. Dyer was a fearsome presence in his role as playing coach, but he was unable to improve Richmond&#x27;s ability to win finals matches. A loss in the 1942 VFL Grand Final to Essendon (after starting as favourite) meant that over the previous 18 years, Richmond had won two flags but been runner-up eight times. Jack Titus set a still unbeaten record of playing in six losing Grand Final teams. In 1943, Richmond broke through to beat Essendon in a thrilling Grand Final by five points, a win that the club dedicated to ex-player Bill Cosgrove, an RAF pilot who had been killed in action a few weeks before the match. But another Grand Final loss followed in 1944, when Dyer&#x27;s team failed against Fitzroy on a very hot day.

===Tough times at Tigerland (1945–1965)===
In the immediate post-war era, despite an influx of excellent new players, Richmond struggled to make the four, appearing in the finals only once, in 1947. Dyer continued on as coach for three years after his playing retirement at the end of 1949, but was asked to retire by the committee who felt the club needed a shake up. Under a succession of coaches in the 1950s, With the demands of potential players increasing with each passing year, the club refused to allocate sufficient funds to recruit and they failed to replace star players as they retired. When stalwarts such as Des Rowe and dual-Brownlow Medallist Roy Wright left, the team slumped dramatically and finished with a wooden spoon in 1960.

In 1962 Graeme Richmond was appointed Secretary of the club, Richmond was the under 19&#x27;s coach who had been around the club since the early 1950s as a junior player until knee injury stopped him from playing so he took on coaching. Graeme understood that for Richmond to improve so would the recruiting. A shrewd businessman, Richmond was able to sign young recruits for bargain like fees. Royce Hart was given a suit and six shirts, and Kevin Bartlett simply walked in off the street. Graeme kept a close eye on the success former player Tom Hafey was having with Shepparton in the Goulburn Valley Football League. When coach Len Smith had a heart attack in 1965, the club appointed Jack Titus to serve as interim coach until a replacement could be found. Hafey was encouraged to apply, and the decision came down to Hafey and former club captain Ron Branton. Many expected Branton to get the job. However, Graeme Richmond saw something special in Hafey and he was appointed coach for the 1966 season.

===Success through Hafey Era (1966–1982)===

1966 heralded the start of the Tom Hafey era. Hafey, a former player of the club, was appointed coach and brought with him a couple of quality young footballers from northern Victoria. Out of the Goulburn Valley came Dick Clay from Kyabram and Francis Bourke from Nathalia. Further afield were Doug Strang and John Perry from Albury and Wodonga.

On his return to Richmond, Hafey found the team had acquired a number of young, high quality players, Kevin Bartlett was a skinny 17 year old who lived locally and had walked in and asked for a tryout. Mike Green followed Kevin a year later. Even so, he quickly put his stamp on the club, bringing intensity and desire to reach the top. Although he acknowledged the ideas and tactical approach of Len Smith (who remained at the club as a selector and consultant), Hafey opted for what became his trademark style: kick the ball long and quickly into the forward line. He raised the bar for fitness among his players,[4] extending pre-season training and introducing a third training night during the week. Richmond quickly became known for being the fittest team in the competition.

Richmond began 1966 strongly. A month before the finals, they hit the top of the ladder for the first time since 1951 and seemed certain to play in September. However, two losses dropped the Tigers to fifth place with thirteen wins and a draw. Richmond dismissed a number of players, replacing them with new players such as Royce Hart, Kevin Sheedy and Francis Bourke.

Richmond dominated the 1967 season, running out winners in a classic Grand Final against Geelong. In his first two years, the team lost only seven games and Hafey had gone from an unknown coach in the bush to the toast of the football world. In hindsight, the 1967 premiership marked a turning point for the game. The Tigers were fitter than any team that had gone before and were the highest scoring team since 1950. Australian football, after two decades of defensive-based play, was about to enter an era of high scoring, aided by rule changes, new tactics and better standards of fitness. They won the 1967 flag in a thrilling encounter with Geelong, ending a 24-year premiership drought.

The Tigers started the 1968 season slowly. They rallied to win the last six games, but missed the finals. When the Tigers were again lethargic in mid-1969, accusations of under-achievement arose and rumours that Hafey was on the way out circulated. The players rallied behind Hafey and finished the season strong, taking fourth place. The team won all three finals, beat the much fancied Carlton in the 1969 VFL Grand Final by 25 points.

After missing the playoffs in 1970, Hafey took the Tigers to the finals for the next five years. Basing the team&#x27;s strategy around all-out attack had drawbacks. Richmond were dominant in 1972 and were hot favourites in the 1972 VFL Grand Final against Carlton. However, Carlton stunned Richmond in a game of ridiculous high scoring. Even Richmond equalled the then record highest score in a Grand Final of 22.18 (150), but Carlton beat it with 28.9 (177). Richmond got their revenge in an intensely physical clash in the 1973 VFL Grand Final and went back-to-back in 1974 with a strong win against a resurgent North Melbourne.

By now, the aggressive attitude of the club both on and off the field had created resentment toward the club. A number of incidents during the 1973 Grand Final – the Windy Hill brawl, the attempted recruitment of John Pitura from South Melbourne and a poor reaction to Kevin Bartlett&#x27;s failure to win the Brownlow medal – all focussed negative attention on the club. Hafey, however, used the resentment to his advantage, telling his players &quot;it&#x27;s Richmond against the world&quot;.

Richmond showed signs of ageing in 1975, when they lost in the preliminary final. Triple Brownlow medallist, Ian Stewart retired, Paul Sproule returned to Hobart, Brian Roberts and two others were part of the John Pitura trade. A raft of other player departures made for a poor 1976 season, Hart spent most of the year nursing a knee and Dick Clay opted to retire. The Tigers finishing seventh, Hafey&#x27;s worst ever result. Internally the Richmond board bickering had flared into the public domain. It took a majority vote for Hafey to be reappointed for 1977, but not unanimously (he had no contract with Richmond, instead being appointed on a year-to-year basis). When it leaked that Graeme Richmond, the club&#x27;s powerbroker, had voted against Hafey&#x27;s reappointment Hafey immediately resigned.

The club appointed dual premiership player Barry Richardson as coach for two seasons before he was replaced by Tony Jewell. Richmond won its next premiership under Jewell with a then record-breaking margin of 81 points over arch-rivals Collingwood in 1980. After reaching and losing the 1982 VFL Grand Final, it has been a rocky road for Richmond who have struggled to come to grips with the rules and regulations of a modernised VFL, including the draft and salary cap. The successes of the early 1980s were bought at high financial cost through expensive recruiting, and were followed by severe cut backs that saw several top players depart.

===Recruiting war (1983–1986)===
Still smarting from the loss of star players to Collingwood, Richmond set themselves for war with Collingwood in 1984 by signing three of their players: John Annear, Craig Stewart and Phil Walsh. Not only were there big contracts and transfer fees to pay, but the costs of an expensive court action as well.

Richmond also signed a number of mediocre players on big contracts, and the club&#x27;s financial situation took a battering. With the team failing to improve, a challenge to the committee was brewing and Richmond&#x27;s traditional political stability threatened. The rebel group, organised by long-time servant Bill Durham, convinced former player and coach Barry Richardson to be leader. An election in late 1984 failed to clarify the situation.

Ian Wilson held on to the presidency into the new year. When the one hundredth birthday of the club arrived in February 1985, there was too much dissension to mark the moment fittingly. Eventually, Wilson handed over to Richardson, who had selected his former premiership teammate Paul Sproule to return from Tasmania and take over the coaching position on a guaranteed contract.

As the season progressed with Richmond still struggling, Sproule came under pressure. Richardson guaranteed his position, but at the end of the year, the committee overruled Richardson and sacked Sproule. Incensed, Richardson walked out of Punt Road, which was in turmoil again. Desperately, Richmond turned back to Tony Jewell, who was appointed coach for a second time, the only man in the club&#x27;s history to get a second go at the job. Jewell later commented on the destruction wrought on the club during his four-year absence: &quot;the supporters were gone, the members were gone, the money was gone, ... a real shame.&quot;

With the competition set to expand, Richmond made a number of misguided moves in 1986. To fill the vacancy left by Richardson, Richmond wooed high-flying West Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond to become president. Bond came with an agenda to raise money for the club by listing on the stockmarket and relocating to Brisbane. When the latter plan was revealed in the media, a furious reaction from supporters and high-profile club personalities buried the proposal almost immediately. Early in 1987, Bond&#x27;s tenure at the club ended in farce when he resigned without presiding over a single game. The off-field confusion was reflected in the players&#x27; performance as Richmond slumped to only its second wooden spoon in 70 years.

===&quot;Save Our Skins&quot; and a return to the finals (1987–1995)===

Although the new president, ex-captain Neville Crowe, had stabilised the club and scored a coup by persuading club legend Kevin Bartlett to coach, the club managed to stay solvent by cutting expenses to the bone and paying only two-thirds of the allowable salary cap. But there was no money for recruiting to improve an impoverished playing list. The club struggled to come to terms with the draft after its inception in 1986, and made a number of poor choices—notably, the number one pick in 1987 was used on a player who had only four games with Richmond.

Finally, with the economy in serious recession and interest rates touching seventeen per cent, Richmond&#x27;s creditors came knocking. At one point, an attempt was made to seize the club&#x27;s 1973 and 1974 premiership trophies as securities for unpaid debts, an embarrassing situation. For a number of years, the exact amount that the club owed was not publicly known. After Bartlett came Allan Jeans, who then passed the job to ex-Richmond premiership player John Northey for 1993. Northey returned the team to the simple long-kicking style of the halcyon days under the legendary Tom Hafey. Along with some draft concessions granted by the AFL, Northey&#x27;s efforts gradually improved Richmond. The team fumbled an opportunity to make the 1994 finals, then opened 1995 with its best start to a season in 75 years and eventually made it to the preliminary final. With a talented playing list and a strong administration led by Leon Daphne (Richmond&#x27;s first president from the corporate world, the Alan Bond farce aside), Richmond looked set to become regular finalists again.

===Lost opportunities (1996–2004)===
The anticipated success failed to materialise, partly because Richmond allowed the coaching position to again become unstable. With over a year still to run on his contract, John Northey demanded a contract extension that the club refused. This was because of a rumour that some people with an association with the club were pursuing Essendon coach and former Richmond premiership player Kevin Sheedy. So Northey walked out on Richmond and accepted a longer-term contract to coach the Brisbane Bears. Richmond, caught short, appointed the Bears&#x27; ex-coach Robert Walls for 1996. After several humiliating thrashings in 1997, Robert Walls became the first Richmond coach to be sacked mid-season. After two-and-a-half seasons under Jeff Gieschen, the club appointed ex-St Kilda captain Danny Frawley. After a Preliminary Final appearance in Frawley&#x27;s second season, Richmond overestimated the strength of the list and settled for trading for established players rather than drafting youth. Over the next three seasons, the team managed just 18 wins. The administration continued to support Frawley and ensured that he would see out his contract, a far cry from the way many of his predecessors were treated. However, midway through the 2004 season (a season in which Richmond only managed 4 wins, and lost their last 14 H&amp;A matches), Frawley announced he would be relinquishing his role as Richmond coach at seasons&#x27; end.

===Beginning to rebuild and another wooden spoon (2005–2007)===

Under newly appointed head coach, Terry Wallace, the 2005 pre-season brought renewed optimism at the club. The Tigers held the no. 1 draft pick, selecting Brett Deledio who was touted as a future star and leader. However, the Tigers&#x27; first match of the season (against Geelong), quickly dashed that hope, as they were thrashed by 62 points. However, this loss would spark a change in the Tigers, and in the next 8 weeks of the season, they would go on to win 7 matches (the one exception being a 68-point loss at the hands of St Kilda in Round 5). This included wins over the then-reigning premiers, Port Adelaide, and over then-runners up, the Brisbane Lions. Sitting pretty at 7 wins and 2 losses, and 3rd on the ladder, the impossible prospect of finals football loomed large. However, in the Round 10 match against Melbourne, star player Nathan Brown suffered a horrible leg injury, that would sideline him for the rest of the season. They went on to lose the match by 57 points, and would only register 3 more wins for the season (one of those was against eventual premiers the Sydney Swans by one point, who had a one-point win against Collingwood the round before), eventually finishing 12th.

2006, a year which many experts predicted continued improvement for the Tigers, saw them lose their first H&amp;A match by 115 points, against the Western Bulldogs, after which followed losses to St Kilda and West Coast. By the end of Round 3, things were looking grim for the Tigers once again. However, just as they did in 2005, the Tigers would respond to their poor start by winning 8 of their next 11 matches, and by the end of Round 14, the Tigers were in the Top 8 by a game and percentage. However, their spot in the Top 8 would be short lived, as 4 straight losses between Rounds 15 and 18 would effectively end their finals chances. They finished the 2006 season in 9th place, with 11 wins and 11 losses.

After promising seasons in 2005 and 2006, it was expected that the Tigers would take the next step in 2007, and play finals football. After massive hype in the off-season, the Tigers had a terrible start to the 2007 season, losing their first 9 matches (this included suffering their biggest ever defeat, at the hands of eventual premiers Geelong, by a whopping 157 points). Their first premiership points came in a draw against the Brisbane Lions in Round 10, and their first win of the season didn&#x27;t come until Round 12 against fellow straggler Melbourne. After Round 18 of the season, the Tigers had registered a mere 1 win, 1 draw, and 16 losses, and were looking like recording their worst ever recorded season. However, late-season victories over old rivals Collingwood in Round 19, and Essendon in Round 21, saved them from this fate. They would eventually finish the year as wooden-spooners, with 3 wins, 1 draw, and 18 losses.

===Centenary (2008)===
After the end of the 2007 season, Richmond elected to delist Patrick Bowden, Brent Hartigan, Andrew Krakouer and Carl Peterson. These four joined another four players in leaving Punt Road—veteran Darren Gaspar, Kent Kingsley, Trent Knobel and Ray Hall. While these players left the club Jake King and Angus Graham were elevated off the rookie list.

Next up came the 2007 AFL Draft, in which the Tigers recruited highly rated midfielder Trent Cotchin with their first pick (No. 2 overall), backman Alex Rance (pick No. 18 overall) and ruckman Dean Putt (pick No. 51 overall). Then, in the pre-season draft, they elected to pick David Gourdis with the number one pick. The Tigers also picked Clayton Collard, Jarrod Silvester, Tristan Cartledge and Cameron Howat for the rookie list. Cam Howat had previously been on the rookie list but was delisted then picked up again.

Richmond began the 2008 season with a surprise win over Carlton, but from Rounds 2 to 11, registered only two more wins (and a controversial draw against the Western Bulldogs). The club fought back in the latter half of the season, winning eight of its last 11 matches. However, this was not enough to reach the finals, as Richmond finished two premiership points short (and percentage) of 8th placed Collingwood.

=== Wallace era ends (2009) ===
At the start of 2009, Richmond was said to be rising as a team, and they would be in the eight . They had recruited former Brownlow Medal winner Ben Cousins – who had previously been released by the West Coast Eagles due to drug trouble – and they had rising stars in Brett Deledio and Trent Cotchin. However, the club was beaten by 83 points in Round 1 by Carlton, and did not register a win until Round 5, against North Melbourne. With a record of 2–9 after eleven weeks, Terry Wallace stepped down as coach, having announced his intention during the previous week. Jade Rawlings was announced as caretaker senior coach; he adopted a youth policy for the remainder of the year, which saw experienced players Joel Bowden and Matthew Richardson retire by the end of the year. Rawlings led Richmond to three wins and a draw from eleven games. Richmond finished fifteenth with a record of 5–16–1. On 25 August, Damien Hardwick was appointed to be the senior coach from 2010.

As Jade Rawlings, Craig McRae and Brian Royal left the Tigers assistant coaching panel, Brendon Lade and Justin Leppitsch were appointed as assistant coaches, leaving only Wayne Campbell as a previous Richmond assistant coach. Brendon Gale was also appointed CEO of the Tigers.

===New coach, new list and a new beginning (2010–2012)===

Richmond was not expected to be competitive in 2010, with many commentators predicting the team would win no more than four games. From the 2009 AFL Draft, the Tigers drafted seven new players, which included midfielder Dustin Martin. At the 2010 Pre-season Draft, Richmond recruited young key defender Dylan Grimes, brother of Melbourne defender Jack Grimes.

Damien Hardwick selected a young team at the start of the season, with four debutants, and only three players (Ben Cousins, Chris Newman and Troy Simmonds) over 25 in the Round 1 loss against Carlton. Richmond was winless after nine games, before a scrappy win over Port Adelaide in Round 10. This was the start of a turnaround in Richmond&#x27;s form, with the team winning six out of eight games, to sit with a record of 6–12 after eighteen rounds. After losing the final four matches, Richmond finished fifteenth out of sixteen with a record of 6–16. Young key forward Jack Riewoldt finished the season with 78 goals, to win the Coleman Medal.

Very early in the season, Richmond were criticised for &quot;partying too much&quot; in the wake of its winless start to the season; after the Round 3 loss to the Sydney Swans, Richmond players were reported to be at the bar drinking and acting in a disorderly manner.

Richmond continued to show improvement to finish 12th out of 17 teams in 2011 with eight wins and a draw.

Jack Riewoldt again led the goalkicking with 62 majors, down on his previous year&#x27;s tally of 78. Young midfielder Trent Cotchin won his first Jack Dyer Medal with 236 votes. Cotchin also polled the most votes of any Richmond player in the 2011 Brownlow Medal count with 15 votes. Dustin Martin was next best, polling 12 votes.

Richmond&#x27;s 2012 season did not see an improvement from the previous three years, as they lost 6 games by 12 points or less and finished 12th for the second year running. also beat them, while trailing by ten points with less than a minute remaining, the Tigers produced what former Sydney Swans coach Paul Roos labelled &quot;the worst 47 seconds in footy&quot; to lose by two points. They did, however, defeat both of the eventual grand finalists and during the season, the only team to do so the entire year. 2012 also saw Richmond have its first Brownlow Medallist in over 40 years when Trent Cotchin polled 26 votes to be the joint winner with Hawthorn&#x27;s Sam Mitchell, due to a countback 4 years later after disqualified winner Jobe Watson was stripped of his medal due to the Essendon Football Club supplements saga.

===Return to finals (2013–2016)===

2013 saw Richmond claim a victory over Hawthorn (making it one of only two clubs that season to defeat the eventual premiers) and go on to qualify for its first finals series in over a decade. However, before 94,690 fans—the largest week-one crowd since the VFL/AFL adopted its current finals system—Richmond lost to Carlton in the first elimination final. Also that year, Peggy O&#x27;Neal, an American-born lawyer, became the AFL&#x27;s first female club president when she got the position at Richmond.

After its drought-breaking finals appearance the previous year, Richmond failed to live up to expectations in the first half of the 2014 season, losing 10 of its first 13 matches and dropping to 16th place on the ladder. Despite public sentiment that the season was lost, the club rallied behind a five-goal performance by Cotchin to win against St Kilda. It catalysed a nine-match winning streak, with a Round 23 victory against eventual grand-finalists Sydney raising Richmond to 8th on the ladder and putting the club into its first back-to-back finals appearance since 1975. A 57-point loss to Port Adelaide in an elimination final knocked Richmond out in the first week of the finals. Cotchin won the Jack Dyer Medal for the third time in four years, making him the youngest Richmond player to win three club best and fairest awards.

Richmond faced the prospect of another disappointing season in 2015, losing 4 of its first 6 games. In the following weeks, however, the club registered 4 straight wins, including an upset victory over the previously undefeated Fremantle in Perth, and went on to defeat top-four teams Sydney and reigning premiers Hawthorn. Richmond would go on to win the final four games of the home and away season to finish fifth on the ladder. Facing North Melbourne in an elimination final, Richmond lost by 17 points in front of a crowd of 90,186, making it the club&#x27;s third consecutive first weeks finals loss.

In 2016, Richmond failed to qualify for the finals for the first time in four years. Following a comprehensive Round 3 loss to Adelaide, coach Hardwick said the team would have to &quot;take a little half-step back to go two steps forward.&quot; It would go on to be the story of the season with several major defeats including one against Greater Western Sydney in which Richmond registered its lowest score since 1961. The club debuted six players and brought in two recruits for their first games in the yellow and black.

===Premiership success (2017–2020)===

During the preseason period for 2016/17, Richmond made a number of changes to its playing list and coaching staff. Among these changes was the departure of Brett Deledio to Greater Western Sydney, in a three-way deal involving Geelong that saw the Tigers receive a 2017 first-round draft selection from the Cats, as well as a 2017 third-round selection from the Giants. Richmond also attained the services of Gold Coast Suns midfielder Dion Prestia, Geelong player Josh Caddy, and young Sydney Swans ruckman Toby Nankervis in preparation for the 2017 season.


Richmond began 2017 with 5 straight wins, a feat it had not achieved since 1995. A series of close losses hampered the Tigers throughout the middle of the season, including a 5-point loss to the Western Bulldogs, 2-point loss to Fremantle, and a 3-point loss to the Giants. Richmond ended the season strongly with convincing victories over Fremantle and St Kilda in the final two rounds, elevating the club to 3rd on the ladder. Richmond&#x27;s first final of the season – their qualifying final against the Cats at the MCG – attracted a record qualifying final crowd of 95,028; the Tigers won by 51 points. This sent them to their first preliminary final since 2001, in which Richmond defeated Greater Western Sydney by 36 points in front of a crowd of 94,258 to progress to the Grand Final against Adelaide, their first Grand Final appearance since 1982. The attendance was 100,021, the largest crowd for a Grand Final since 1986. The Crows led at quarter time and were in front by as much as 13, but the Tigers took over the game as it progressed and kicked seven straight goals at one point with former South Australian U-19 captain Jack Graham finishing as the game&#x27;s leading goalscorer after kicking three despite playing only his fifth game at AFL level. They eventually would win by 48 points – 16.12 (108) to Adelaide&#x27;s 8.12 (60) – to end their 37-year flag drought. Dustin Martin also became the first player to win a Premiership medal, the Brownlow Medal and the Norm Smith Medal in the same season, while Damien Hardwick was named AFL Coaches Association Coach of the Year. Richmond&#x27;s jump from 13th to premiers also marked the biggest jump from one AFL season to the next.

The reigning premiers were dominant throughout the 2018 season, winning their first minor premiership since 1982 with an 18–4 win–loss record. Richmond won all 17 of their games in Victoria during the home-and-away season, and broke the record for most consecutive wins at the MCG, winning 22 games at the venue (starting from round 14, 2017) and eclipsing the record of 17 set by Melbourne in 1955–56.

The Tigers defeated Hawthorn by 31 points in the first qualifying final at the MCG and were seemingly destined to win a second consecutive flag. However, they were stunningly denied a repeat Grand Final appearance after Collingwood defeated them by 39 points in the first preliminary final.

Jack Riewoldt had an outstanding year for Richmond, winning his third Coleman Medal after kicking 65 goals during the regular season, his second Jack Dyer Medal and receiving his third
All-Australian selection. Three other Tigers received All-Australian honours: Alex Rance (fullback), Dustin Martin (centre) and Shane Edwards (interchange), and four more were shortlisted in the initial 40-man squad: captain Trent Cotchin, Josh Caddy, Dylan Grimes and Kane Lambert. Exciting young forward/midfielder Jack Higgins capped off a stellar debut season by winning Goal of the Year for his highly memorable scissor-kick goal against Collingwood in Round 19.

At the conclusion of the season, Richmond acquired former co-captain Tom Lynch via free agency on 8 October. Five players departed the club during the free agency and trade periods: Reece Conca left to as a free agent on 5 October, Anthony Miles and Corey Ellis were traded to Gold Coast along with a third round draft pick on 8 October in exchange for another third round pick, Tyson Stengle was traded to Adelaide in exchange for its fourth round pick on 15 October, and Sam Lloyd was sent to the for pick 64 on 15 October. In addition, Ben Griffiths retired in January to pursue a college football career in the United States and Shaun Hampson retired on 26 June, citing a chronic back condition.

Richmond were looking to rebound in 2019 after the bitter disappointment of their unexpected preliminary final exit. They suffered various setbacks during the first half of the season, with several of their best players sidelined, most notably Alex Rance who suffered a career-ending ACL injury in Round 1 against Carlton. The Tigers were resilient in spite of their misfortune, winning six games in a seven-game stretch from round four to round 10. Despite a midseason slump where three losses on the trot dislodged them from the top eight, the Tigers re-emerged from the mid-year bye a different team and would not lose again for the rest of the season. They won their last nine games of the home-and-away season and finished third on the ladder with a 16–6 win–loss record, trailing minor premiers Geelong and second-placed Brisbane on percentage.
They would defeat both teams en route to their second grand final in three years, dispatching the Lions by 47 points in the second qualifying final at the Gabba (marking their first interstate finals victory) before coming from 21 points down at half time to beat the Cats by 19 points in the second preliminary final at the MCG. They met Greater Western Sydney in the 2019 AFL Grand Final on 28 September, thrashing the Giants by 89 points – their biggest ever win in a grand final, eclipsing their 81-point victory over Collingwood in 1980. Martin won his second Norm Smith Medal, becoming just the fourth to win multiple Norm Smith Medals after Gary Ayres, Andrew McLeod and Luke Hodge. Cotchin equaled Dan Minogue, Percy Bentley and Royce Hart with his second Premiership as Richmond captain while Hardwick became the Tigers&#x27; first multiple Premiership coach since Tom Hafey – whose widow Maureen presented the two of them with the Premiership cup. Richmond also chose to debut Marlion Pickett, who they had drafted midseason following Grigg&#x27;s retirement and who had won the Norm Goss Medal in the VFL Grand Final against Williamstown the previous week. Pickett not only became the first player to make his senior debut in an AFL or VFL Grand Final since Keith Batchelor for Collingwood in 1952, but he also kicked his first AFL goal in the third quarter and finished with four Norm Smith Medal votes.
Despite some off-field indiscretions during the 2020 season and playing most of the season interstate due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the reigning premiers finished in the top four for the fourth consecutive season, qualifying in third place with 12 wins, four losses and a draw after a shortened 17-match home-and-away season. Richmond faltered against the Brisbane Lions in the qualifying final, but recovered to play in their third Grand Final in four years after defeating St Kilda by 31 points in the semi-final and pipping minor premiers Port Adelaide by six points in the preliminary final. The Tigers would meet Geelong at the Gabba in the first VFL/AFL Grand Final to be played outside Victoria, and despite trailing the Cats by 22 points deep in the second term, Richmond scored 10 of the final 12 goals of the match to run out 31-point winners. It marked their third premiership in four years and also made them the first team since Hawthorn completed their three-peat in 2015 to win consecutive premierships. Martin, who kicked four goals, became the first-ever three-time Norm Smith Medalist, while Cotchin became the club&#x27;s first-ever three-time Premiership captain.

=== End of a dynasty (2021–present) ===

The Tigers&#x27; four-year era of success would come to a halt in 2021. Despite a decent start to the year, winning seven of their first 12 matches, the reigning premiers would fall away rapidly to win just two of their last 10. With a season record of nine wins, 12 losses and a draw, Richmond finished 12th and missed the finals for the first time since 2016. The Tigers became the fourth team in five years to miss the finals after playing in the previous year&#x27;s grand final, following 2016 premiers the Western Bulldogs, 2017 runners-up Adelaide and 2019 runners-up Greater Western Sydney.

At the conclusion of the season, triple-premiership captain Trent Cotchin relinquished his role as skipper, and Dylan Grimes and Toby Nankervis were appointed as co-captains for the 2022 season.

Richmond were looking to rebound quickly from their poor 2021 season. Despite some inconsistent form throughout the 2022 season, which included dispiriting losses to also-rans Gold Coast and North Melbourne, and a low-scoring draw against Fremantle, the Tigers were able to secure an eighth finals berth in 10 seasons, finishing seventh on the ladder with 13 wins, eight losses and one draw. However, their finals campaign came to an early end after a heart-breaking two-point loss to Brisbane in a high scoring elimination final. Three time premiership player and 300 gamer Shane Edwards announced his retirement at the conclusion of the season.

The 2023 season truly was the end of the Dynasty Era at Tigerland. Three time premiership coach Damien Hardwick announced he would be resigning from his position after a 1-point defeat to Essendon in Round 10. This shocked the football world as Hardwick sited &#x27;burnout&#x27; as his reasoning for departing the club prior to his contract ending. Later in the year he would sign a 6-year deal as coach of the Gold Coast Suns, confusing many of the Richmond faithful.

Andrew McQualter took the reins as interim coach for the remainder of the season with mixed success. The club would eventually finish 13th and miss the finals with 10 wins, 12 losses and a draw. Late in the season, club legends Trent Cotchin &amp; Jack Riewoldt announced they would be retiring after the clubs Round 23 fixture against North Melbourne at the MCG. Over 60,000 supporters turned out to farewell the retiring champions as the Tigers won the match by 29 points.

The season finished with Richmond suffering a loss at Adelaide Oval against Port Adelaide, with many of the clubs young players being showcased – showing promising signs for the seasons ahead. The club announced on 21 September that Adem Yze would be taking over as the clubs new Senior Coach, beating Andrew McQualter to win the position.

Richmond finished last on the AFL ladder in 2024, claiming its eighth wooden spoon only four years after winning its most recent premiership. Premiership players Dylan Grimes, Dustin Martin and Marlion Pickett all retired following the conclusion of the season.

==Club identity and culture==
Initially, Richmond saw itself as a gentlemanly and sportsman-like club; it even went to the extent of sacking a player who used poor language. During the early 1900s, the club used the press as a forum to publicise a campaign against violence in the game, which earned the derision of some rival clubs. This image followed the club into the VFL in 1908 and during the First World War the club emphasised the number of men associated with the club who had enlisted and served overseas. But the club&#x27;s actions in 1916, when it voted with three other clubs seen as representative of the working class (Collingwood, Fitzroy and Carlton) to continue playing football, left no doubt as to which side of the class divide that the Tigers belonged. The club&#x27;s self-consciously non-confrontational image can be partly attributed to two of its long serving presidents—George Bennett (1887–1908) and Frank Tudor (1909–1918). Both were Richmond men and respected parliamentarians who took the view that how the game was played was more important than whether the game was won.

After World War I, the club&#x27;s attitude hardened as they attempted to match it with the then power clubs Collingwood and Carlton. Eventually, the Tigers became more prosaic in their approach to recruiting and training.

The Hafey era transformed Richmond into one of the most feared combinations in the then VFL. The club&#x27;s football administrator, Graeme Richmond, drove the &quot;win at all costs&quot; mentality across the whole club, making Richmond a formidable force, winning five premierships from 1967 to 1980.

Since the Tigers&#x27; grand final appearance in 1982, the club appeared in five finals series (1995, 2001, 2013, 2014 and 2015) before winning another preliminary final and eventually breaking their Premiership drought as board and coaching instability during the 1980s and 1990s distracted the club and forced its focus away from becoming an on-field force.

The club also hosts the Korin Gamadji Institute (KGI) at Punt Road, which has delivered highly-unique and innovative leadership and well-being programming for young Indigenous boys and girls since 2008. In 2018, Richmond became the first sports club to present at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.

===Guernseys===
The club&#x27;s current home jumper design is black and features a yellow sash running from the top left of the jumper to the bottom right. For away games against teams with dark coloured jumpers, the club wears a clash strip with a reverse of this design, a black sash on a yellow base. In its first season, Richmond wore a blue jumper with a thin yellow-and-black sash running from right to left. Between 2011 and 2016, the club guernseys were manufactured by sportswear company BLK, who were known as KooGa Australia prior to 2014, before it went into receivership in November 2016. Puma manufactures the club&#x27;s on-and-off field apparel. With the change to Puma, the yellow used is reasonably lighter than the sash seen in the past few years.

====Uniform evolution====

===Song===
Prior to 1962, the Richmond Football Club did not have an official club song. Instead, on away trips players would sing from a large collection of well-known ditties like &quot;With a Hat on One Side&quot;, and &quot;Barefoot Days&quot;. A record, endorsed or officially adopted by the club, was released in the 1950s by The Thinmen and The Party Allstars called &quot;Onward the Tigers&quot; (before 1962), set to the tune of the traditional Australian bush ballad &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;. In 1962, Jack Malcomson, a cabaret singer, tapdancer, and bit actor, who was performing regularly at the Richmond Football Club Pleasant Sunday Morning events, was approached by committeeman Alf Barnett to write an official club song, so he adapted &quot;Row, Row, Row&quot; (Monaco/Jerome), a show tune from the Ziegfeld Follies of 1912, to create &quot;We&#x27;re From Tigerland&quot;. The current version of the song used by the club is a modified version of the 1972 recording performed by the Fable Singers, released for the start of season 2018; Richmond Team of the Century players Kevin Bartlett and Matthew Richardson&#x27;s voices were incorporated into the new mix. The song replaces &quot;skin&quot; with &quot;shin&quot;, which was Malcomson&#x27;s original lyric. In 2014, the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; named it the top club song of any AFL team. &quot;Tigerland&quot; is noted for the line &quot;Yellow and black&quot;, which fans of the club shout when the song is performed at games.

: &quot;Oh, we&#x27;re from Tigerland&quot;
: &quot;A fighting fury, we&#x27;re from Tigerland&quot;
: &quot;In any weather, you will see us with a grin&quot;
: &quot;Risking head and shin&quot;
: &quot;If we&#x27;re behind, then never mind&quot;
: &quot;We&#x27;ll fight and fight and win&quot;
: &quot;For we&#x27;re from Tigerland&quot;
: &quot;We never weaken &#x27;till the final siren&#x27;s gone&quot;
: &quot;Like the tiger of old&quot;
: &quot;We&#x27;re strong and we&#x27;re bold&quot;
: &quot;For we&#x27;re from Tiger&quot;
: &quot;Yellow and black&quot;
: &quot;We&#x27;re from Tigerland&quot;

==Stadium==
The club&#x27;s home ground is the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), where the team plays most of their home matches in the regular season. The MCG has a capacity of 100,024 and the club usually draws large attendances against Victorian clubs, particularly rivals such as Essendon, Collingwood, Carlton and Hawthorn.

The club also plays home games against local and interstate clubs with smaller supporter bases in Melbourne at the smaller capacity Docklands Stadium. Since 2011, Richmond have played one home game per year at the ground.

Richmond&#x27;s training ground and base of operations is located at the Punt Road Oval, currently branded as the Swinburne Centre, located a few hundred metres from the MCG.

Richmond has a large supporter base which is known for its dedication, including its personal cheer squad, who attend both home and away matches for the club. 

The building of the fan base was a slow process for Richmond. In the 1890s, the club never sold more than 300 season tickets, but the following was built up with success in the VFA and membership numbered about 2,000 at the time of admission to the VFL in 1908. Between the wars, the club captured the imagination of the residents of Richmond. The successful Tigers were a positive motif for the oppressed working class community which suffered deprivation during the Great Depression. At this time, the Richmond community was almost half Catholic, and this demographic was reflected in the club among the players and officials.

As Melbourne dramatically spread out in the post-war years, so too did the Richmond supporters. Many were now concentrated in the eastern suburbs, which eventually formed the club&#x27;s metropolitan recruiting zone. Indeed, at one point during the early development of the Waverley Park ground, the Tigers considered making the stadium its home for this reason. Following the barren period of the 1950s, Richmond was able to tap into the large number of fans by moving home matches to the MCG and almost doubled attendance figures. The Tigers maintained this advantage over the other clubs until the mid-1980s, when poor administration led to a downturn in every area of the club. As the club struggled for funds, the membership plummeted from over 10,000 to under 3,000.

The greatest display of loyalty from the fans occurred during 1990. Threatened by liquidation, the supporters rallied to pay off the multimillion-dollar debt via the &quot;Save Our Skins&quot; campaign. In 2011, the club launched the &quot;Fighting Tiger Fund&quot; to reduce the club&#x27;s debt and to allow it to increase spending on the football department in order to be more competitive on field.

In 2013, the club launched &quot;The Roar is Back&quot; membership promotion aiming at signing up 60,000 members in a season for the first time ever. Following a successful campaign, on 24 June 2013, Richmond chief executive Brendon Gale confirmed that membership had passed 60,000. The club created a limited edition commemorative Sherrin football to celebrate the achievement, and it was distributed free to families at the &#x27;Thank you for 60,000 members BBQ/Training Morning&#x27; at Punt Road Oval on 29 June 2013. The official membership total for 2013 was 60,321.

For statistical purposes, 30 June is the cut-off date for membership numbers, although it does continue to sell memberships. In 2013, after 30 June, the club commenced bundling 2013 and 2014 membership years into a special &quot;Sign up as a member for 2014 and get the rest of 2013 free!&quot; offer. The 2014 membership total of 66,122 gave Richmond the 3rd-biggest membership base in the AFL, behind Collingwood and Hawthorn (80,793 and 68,650, respectively). This record was again broken in 2015 with the club signing up 70,809 members, still ranking 3rd in total membership numbers. The club averaged the highest crowds in the AFL of 49,841 in 2015; the home crowd averaged 53,236 the highest in the 2015 AFL season.

Following Richmond&#x27;s 2017 premiership, the club shattered its membership record by more than 28,000 for season 2018 and became the first team to get over 100,000 members when it registered 100,726 members. It also had the most members of any Australian sporting team until West Coast eclipsed it in 2022. Richmond has surpassed the 100,000-member mark for six years running.

===Richmond Team of the Century===
In 1998, Richmond announced its Team of the 20th Century. The selection of the 22 players shows an even spread of champions from all the eras of the club: Thorp from the club&#x27;s first premiership wins of 1920–21; McCormack, Strang, Titus and Dyer from the inter-war years; Rowe, Morris and Wright from the battling era after the war; Richardson and Knights from recent times. But the great days from the late 1960s to the early 1980s provide the bulk of the side: Sheedy, Green, Keane, Bourke, Barrot, Clay, Hart, Dean and Bartlett who made up the core of Tom Hafey&#x27;s teams, and later success stories Weightman and Raines. Ian Stewart, named on the bench, managed selection in a team of the century at two clubs—he was named in the centre of St Kilda&#x27;s team as well. Richmond has four players denoted below with an asterisk who are also members of AFL Team of the Century. This is the second-most of any club.

Since then there have been a further twelves batches of inductees added, most recently in 2023, for a total of 69 members. Below is a list of members, their contributions to the club, and the year they were inducted. To date, nine Richmond &quot;Immortals&quot; have been named, the highest level of honour within the Hall of Fame. The first of these was Jack Dyer, who was immediately made an &#x27;immortal&#x27; upon his induction into the Hall of Fame in 2002, the year before his death.

The &quot;Immortals&quot; are highlighted in yellow in the table below and have their names in bold.

===&quot;100 Tiger Treasures&quot;===
During the centenary season the tigers announced their 100 Tiger Treasures consisting of 10 awards, each with 10 nominees given by the Richmond Football Club in 2008 to celebrate their centenary year of competition in the VFL/AFL. The awards were mostly given to players but also club moments and campaigns. On Saturday, 28 June held a centenary celebration at Punt Road Oval before the centenary game at the MCG against arch rivals later that day.

==Current squad==
==Reserves team==

The Richmonds reserves are the reserves team of the club. The latest iteration of the side was created in 2013, and has competed in the Victorian Football League (VFL) since 2014.

===History===
Richmond City and West Richmond amalgamated on 2 April 1902 to become Richmond Junior League Football Club, with the Richmond Football Club offering the new club free use of its ground and facilities. The side, which operated independently from the senior club until 1959, first competed in the Victorian Junior Football Association before joining the Victorian Junior Football League in 1919.

The Richmond juniors recorded its first premiership in 1929. In the following 68 years, Richmond went on to win a further eight premierships in reserve-grade football.

The Richmond reserves joined the Victorian Football League competition after the AFL reserves was disbanded, finishing 17th at the end of their first season in 2000.

In 2001, the reserves side was dissolved and the club entered a reserves affiliation with the Coburg Football Club. This arrangement lasted from 2001 until 2013.

Richmond ended the affiliation at the end of 2013, seeking to re-establish a more direct developmental structure by operating a stand-alone reserves team. The reformed Richmond reserves team has played in the VFL since 2014, playing its home games at the Punt Road Oval, with many staged as curtain raisers to the club&#x27;s senior home and away games at the nearby Melbourne Cricket Ground. The team is made up of a combination of senior listed AFL players, rookie listed players and VFL exclusive contracted players.

===Premierships===
===Seasons===
==Women&#x27;s teams==
The Richmond Football Club fields a team in the premier national league for women, the AFL Women&#x27;s competition. The club entered the league in 2020. For two seasons in 2018 and 2019, the club also fielded a team in the state-league level VFL Women&#x27;s competition.

The program, including development pathways, is presently overseen by the women&#x27;s football operations manager, Kate Sheahan.

===History===
Richmond has a thin history with women&#x27;s football, with the club connected to just two women&#x27;s matches in the 20th century. The first occurred in 1923, with a team dubbed the &quot;Tigresses&quot; playing off against the club&#x27;s junior men&#x27;s team (Cubs) as a fundraiser for a VFL team&#x27;s interstate trip. As was the case with women versus men charity matches in that era, the men&#x27;s team competed in the match in full fancy dress attire and were hobbled at the knees. In what was a non-serious affair the women&#x27;s side (9.14 (68)) defeated the Cubs side (0.1 (1)). In August 1933, however, an all women&#x27;s match was held between teams representing the suburbs of Richmond and Carlton in a charity match. While the Carlton team was associated with the club itself, Richmond did not pair with the side that played under its moniker. The match, played at Carlton&#x27;s home ground, Princes Park, drew an estimated crowd of 10,000 and raised funds as part of a VFL bye-week carnival for the Royal Melbourne Hospital.

===AFL Women&#x27;s team===
In 2016, Richmond was among 13 AFL clubs to bid for licenses to compete in the soon to be formed AFL Women&#x27;s competition. The club was one of five to miss out, instead being awarded provisional licenses guaranteeing access in later expansions. The following year they would again bid, this time winning the right to entry into the competition&#x27;s fourth season, to be held in 2020. The club&#x27;s first player signing came in the April 2019 expansion signing period, securing former captain Katie Brennan, who would go on to captain the club in its first season in the league.

===VFL Women&#x27;s team===
In October 2017, Richmond was granted a license to field a team in the 2018 VFL Women&#x27;s season. They were one of 13 clubs in the competition that season, including all 10 Victorian-based AFL clubs. The league operated in the winter season (separately to the AFLW competition). Former men&#x27;s VFL assistant coach Tom Hunter was named the team&#x27;s head coach in November 2017 and served in the role over the 2018 and 2019 seasons. Jess Kennedy was named the team&#x27;s inaugural captain in May 2018. After two seasons in the competition and following the cancellation of the 2020 season due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the club withdrew from the competition and entered into an alignment with the Port Melbourne Football Club.

====Season summaries====
==Wheelchair football==
Richmond has had a team compete in the Victorian Wheelchair Football League since its inception in 2018. The team were runners up in 2018 before winning the league premiership in 2019. After a two-year hiatus due to the suspension of the 2020 &amp; 2021 seasons as a result of the COVID pandemic, Richmond won their second league premiership as well as the development league premiership in 2022.

<text>Sargon II (, meaning &quot;the faithful king&quot; or &quot;the legitimate king&quot;) was the king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from 722 BC to his death in battle in 705. Probably the son of Tiglath-Pileser III (745–727), Sargon is generally believed to have become king after overthrowing Shalmaneser V (727–722), probably his brother. He is typically considered the founder of a new dynastic line, the Sargonid dynasty.

Modelling his reign on the legends of the ancient rulers Sargon of Akkad, from whom Sargon II likely took his regnal name, and Gilgamesh, Sargon aspired to conquer the known world, initiate a golden age and a new world order, and be remembered and revered by future generations. Over the course of his seventeen-year reign, Sargon substantially expanded Assyrian territory and enacted important political and military reforms. An accomplished warrior-king and military strategist, Sargon personally led his troops into battle. By the end of his reign, all of his major enemies and rivals had been either defeated or pacified. Among Sargon&#x27;s greatest accomplishments were the stabilization of Assyrian control over the Levant, the weakening of the northern kingdom of Urartu, and the reconquest of Babylonia. From 717 to 707, Sargon constructed a new Assyrian capital named after himself, Dur-Sharrukin (&#x27;Fort Sargon&#x27;), which he made his official residence in 706.

Sargon considered himself to have been divinely mandated to maintain and ensure justice. Like other Assyrian kings, Sargon at times enacted brutal punishments against his enemies but there are no known cases of atrocities against civilians from his reign. He worked to assimilate and integrate conquered foreign peoples into the empire and extended the same rights and obligations to them as native Assyrians. He forgave defeated enemies on several occasions and maintained good relations with foreign kings and with the ruling classes of the lands he conquered. Sargon also increased the influence and status of both women and scribes at the royal court.

Sargon embarked on his final campaign, against Tabal in Anatolia, in 705. He was killed in battle and the Assyrian army was unable to retrieve his body, preventing a traditional burial. According to ancient Mesopotamian religion, he was cursed to remain a restless ghost for eternity. Sargon&#x27;s fate was a major psychological blow for the Assyrians and damaged his legacy. Sargon&#x27;s son Sennacherib was deeply disturbed by his father&#x27;s death and believed that he must have committed some grave sin. As a result, Sennacherib distanced himself from Sargon. Sargon was barely mentioned in later ancient literature and nearly completely forgotten until the ruins of Dur-Sharrukin were discovered in the 19th century. He was not fully accepted in Assyriology as a real king until the 1860s. Due to his conquests and reforms, Sargon is today considered one of the most important Assyrian kings.

== Background ==

=== Ancestry and rise to the throne ===

Nothing is known of Sargon II&#x27;s life before he became king. He was probably born 770 BC and cannot have been born later than 760 BC. His reign was immediately preceded by those of Tiglath-Pileser III (745–727) and Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s son Shalmaneser V (727–722). Although Sargon is generally regarded as the founder of a new dynastic line, the Sargonid dynasty, he was probably a scion of the incumbent Adaside dynasty. Sargon grew up during the reigns of Ashur-dan III (773–755) and Ashur-nirari V (755–745), when rebellion and plague affected the Neo-Assyrian Empire; the prestige and power of Assyria dramatically declined. This trend reversed during the tenure of Tiglath-Pileser, who reduced the influence of powerful officials, reformed the army and more than doubled the size of the empire. In contrast to Tiglath-Pileser, little is recorded of Shalmaneser&#x27;s brief reign.

Whereas kings typically elaborated on their origin in inscriptions, Sargon stated that the Assyrian national deity Ashur had called him to the throne. Sargon mentioned his origin in just two known inscriptions, where he referred to himself as Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s son, and in the Borowski Stele, probably from Hama in Syria, which referenced his &quot;royal fathers&quot;. Most historians cautiously accept that Sargon was Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s son but not the legitimate heir to the throne as the next-in-line after Shalmaneser. If Sargon was Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s son, his mother might have been the queen Iaba. Some Assyriologists, such as Natalie Naomi May, have suggested that Sargon was a member of a collateral branch of the Adaside dynasty from the western part of the empire. In Babylonia, Sargon and his successors were considered part of the &quot;dynasty of Hanigalbat&quot; (a western territory), while earlier Assyrian kings were considered part of the &quot;dynasty of Baltil&quot; (Baltil being the name of the oldest portion of the ancient Assyrian capital of Assur). Perhaps Sargon was connected to a junior branch of the royal dynasty established at Hanigalbat centuries earlier. Some Assyriologists, such as John Anthony Brinkman, believe that Sargon did not belong to the direct dynastic lineage.
The Babylonian Chronicles report that Shalmaneser died in January 722 and was succeeded in the same month by Sargon, who was between forty and fifty years old. The exact events surrounding his accession are not clear. Some historians such as Josette Elayi believe that Sargon legitimately inherited the throne. Most scholars however believe him to have been a usurper; one theory is that Sargon killed Shalmaneser and seized the throne in a palace coup. Sargon rarely referenced his predecessors and, upon accession, faced massive domestic opposition. Shalmaneser probably had sons of his own who could have inherited the throne, such as the palace official Ashur-dain-aplu, who retained a prominent position under the Sargonid kings. Sargon&#x27;s only known reference to Shalmaneser describes Ashur punishing him for his policies:

Sargon did not otherwise hold Shalmaneser responsible for the policies placed on Assur, since he wrote elsewhere that most of these had been enacted in the distant past. Tiglath-Pileser, not Shalmaneser, imposed forced labor on the residents of Assur. Several of Shalmaneser&#x27;s policies and acts were revoked by Sargon. Hullî, a king in Tabal (a region in Anatolia) deported by Shalmaneser, was reinstalled and Sargon reversed Shalmaneser&#x27;s attempt to decrease trade with Egypt.

=== Name ===

Sargon II was the first king in more than a thousand years to bear the name Sargon. There were two Mesopotamian kings of the same name before his reign: Sargon I, a minor Assyrian king of the 19th century BC (after whom Sargon II is enumerated by modern historians), and the far more prominent 24th–23rd century BC Sargon of Akkad, conqueror of large parts of Mesopotamia and the founder of the Akkadian Empire. Sargon was probably an assumed regnal name. Royal names in ancient Mesopotamia were deliberate choices, setting the tone for a king&#x27;s reign. Sargon most likely chose the name due to its use by Sargon of Akkad. In late Assyrian texts, the names of Sargon II and Sargon of Akkad are written with the same spelling. Sargon II is sometimes explicitly called the &quot;second Sargon&quot; (&quot;Šarru-kīn arkû&quot;). Though the precise extent of the ancient Sargon&#x27;s conquests had been forgotten, the legendary ruler was still remembered as a &quot;conqueror of the world&quot;. Sargon II also energetically pursued the expansion of his own empire.

In addition to the name&#x27;s historical connections, Sargon connected his regnal name to justice. In several inscriptions, Sargon described his name as akin to a divine mandate to ensure that his people lived just lives, for instance in an inscription in which Sargon described how he reimbursed the owners of the land he chose to construct his new capital city of Dur-Sharrukin on:

The name was most commonly written &quot;Šarru-kīn&quot;, although &quot;Šarru-ukīn&quot;, is also attested. Sargon&#x27;s name is commonly interpreted as &quot;the faithful king&quot; in the sense of righteousness and justice. Another alternative is that &quot;Šarru-kīn&quot; is a phonetic reproduction of the contracted pronunciation of &quot;Šarru-ukīn&quot; to &quot;Šarrukīn&quot;, which means that it should be interpreted as &quot;the king has obtained/established order&quot;, possibly referencing disorder either under his predecessor or caused by Sargon&#x27;s usurpation. &quot;Šarru-kīn&quot; can also be interpreted as &quot;the legitimate king&quot; or &quot;the true king&quot; and it could have been chosen because Sargon was not the legitimate heir to the throne. The ancient Sargon of Akkad also became king through usurpation. The origin of the conventional modern version of the name, Sargon, is not entirely clear but it is probably based on the spelling in the Hebrew Bible (&quot;srgwn&quot;).

== Reign ==

=== Early reign and rebellions ===

Sargon&#x27;s reign began with large-scale resistance against his rule in Assyria&#x27;s heartland. Although quickly suppressed, this political instability led several peripheral regions to regain independence. In early 721, Marduk-apla-iddina II, a Chaldean warlord of the Bit-Yakin tribe, captured Babylon, restored Babylonian independence after eight years of Assyrian rule and allied with the eastern realm of Elam. Though Sargon considered Marduk-apla-iddina&#x27;s seizure of Babylonia to be unacceptable, an attempt to defeat him in battle near Der in 720 was unsuccessful. At the same time, Yahu-Bihdi of Hama in Syria assembled a coalition of minor states in the northern Levant to oppose Assyrian dominion.

In addition to these revolts, Sargon may have had to deal with unfinished conflicts from Shalmaneser&#x27;s reign. At some point in the 720s, the Assyrians captured Samaria after a siege lasting several years and ended the Kingdom of Israel, with its territory becoming the new Assyrian province of Samerina. Sargon claimed to have conquered the city, but it is more likely that Shalmaneser captured the city since both the Babylonian Chronicles and the Hebrew Bible viewed the fall of Israel as the signature event of his reign. Sargon&#x27;s claim to conquering it may be related to the city being captured again after Yahu-Bihdi&#x27;s revolt. Either Shalmaneser or Sargon ordered the dispersal of the city of Samaria&#x27;s population across the Assyrian Empire, following the standard resettlement policy. This specific resettlement resulted in the loss of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. In his inscriptions, Sargon claimed to have resettled 27,280 Israelites. Though likely emotionally damaging for the resettled populace, the Assyrians valued deportees for their labor and generally treated them well, transporting them in safety and comfort together with their families and belongings.

Shortly after his failure to retake Babylonia from Marduk-apla-iddina in 720, Sargon campaigned against Yahu-Bihdi. Among Yahu-Bihdi&#x27;s supporters were the cities of Arpad, Damascus, Sumur and Samaria. Three of the cities participating in the revolt (Arpad, Sumur and Damascus) were not vassal states; their lands had been converted into Assyrian provinces governed by royally appointed Assyrian governors. The revolt threatened to undo the administrative system established in Syria by Sargon&#x27;s predecessors and the insurgents went on a killing spree, murdering all local Assyrians they could find.

Sargon engaged Yahu-Bihdi and his coalition at Qarqar on the Orontes. Defeated, Yahu-Bihdi escaped into Qarqar, which Sargon besieged and captured. Sargon&#x27;s army destroyed Qarqar and devastated the surrounding lands. Yahu-Bihdi was first deported to Assyria together with his family and then flayed alive. Hama and the other insurgent cities were annexed again. At the same time as large numbers of people from Syria were resettled in other parts of the empire, Sargon resettled some people to Syria, including 6,300 &quot;guilty Assyrians&quot;, presumably Assyrians from the heartland who had fought against Sargon upon his accession but whose lives had been spared. Sargon described their resettlement as an act of mercy: &quot;their transgression I disregarded, I had mercy on them&quot;.

Around the same time as Yahu-Bihdi, Hanunu of Gaza in the south also rebelled against Assyria. After Sargon had defeated Yahu-Bihdi, he marched south. After capturing some other cities on his way, probably including Ekron and Gibbethon, the Assyrians defeated Hanunu, whose army had been bolstered by allies from Egypt, at Rafah. Despite the transgression, Gaza was kept as a semi-autonomous vassal state and not outright annexed, perhaps because the location, on the border of Egypt, was of high strategic importance.

=== Proxy wars and minor conflicts ===
A pressing concern for Sargon was the kingdom of Urartu in the north. Though no longer as powerful as it had been in the past, when it at times rivalled Assyria in strength and influence, Urartu still remained an alternative suzerain for many smaller states in the north. In 718, Sargon intervened in Mannaea, one of these states. This campaign was as much a military effort as it was a diplomatic one; King Iranzu of Mannaea had been an Assyrian vassal for more than 25 years and had requested Sargon to aid him. A rebellion by the Urartu-aligned noble Mitatti occupied half of Iranzu&#x27;s kingdom, but thanks to Sargon, Mitatti&#x27;s uprising was suppressed. Shortly after the victory over the rebels, Iranzu died and Sargon intervened in the succession, supporting Iranzu&#x27;s son Aza rise to the throne of Mannaea. Another son, Ullusunu, contested his brother&#x27;s accession and was supported in his efforts against him by Rusa I of Urartu.

Another of Sargon&#x27;s prominent foreign enemies was the powerful and expansionist Midas of Phrygia in central Anatolia. Sargon worried about a possible alliance between Phrygia and Urartu and Midas&#x27; use of proxy warfare by encouraging Assyrian vassal states to rebel. Sargon could not fight against Midas directly but had to deal with uprisings by his vassals among the Syro-Hittite states, most of them located in remote locations in the mountains of southern Anatolia. It was crucial to keep control over the regions of Tabal and Quwê to prevent communication between Midas and Rusa. Tabal—several minor states competing with each other, contested between Assyria, Phrygia and Urartu—was particularly important since it was rich in natural resources (including silver). Sargon campaigned against Tabal in 718, mostly against Kiakki of Shinuhtu, who withheld tribute and conspired with Midas. Sargon could not conquer Tabal because of its isolation and difficult terrain. Instead, Shinuhtu was given to a rival Tabalian ruler, Kurtî of Atunna. Kurtî conspired with Midas at some point between 718 and 713, but later maintained his allegiance to Sargon.
Sargon returned to Syria in 717 to defeat an uprising led by Pisiri of Carchemish, who had supported Sargon during Yahu-Bihdi&#x27;s revolt but was now plotting with Midas to overthrow Assyrian hegemony in the region. The uprising was defeated and the population of Carchemish was deported and replaced with Assyrians. The city and its surrounding lands were turned into an Assyrian province and an Assyrian palace was constructed. The conquest might have inspired Sargon to build his own new capital city (Dur-Sharrukin), a project which could be financed with the silver plundered from Carchemish. Sargon took so much silver from Carchemish that silver began to replace copper as the currency of the empire. Despite Sargon&#x27;s repeated victories in the west, the Levant was not fully stabilized.

Sargon established a new trading post near the border of Egypt in 716, staffed it with people deported from various conquered lands and placed it under the local Arab ruler Laban, an Assyrian vassal. In later writings, Sargon for unknown reasons falsely claimed that he in this year also subjugated the people of Egypt. In actuality, Sargon is recorded to have engaged in diplomacy with Pharaoh Osorkon IV, who gifted Sargon with twelve horses.

In 716, Sargon campaigned between Urartu and Elam, perhaps part of a strategy to weaken these enemies. Passing through Mannaea, Sargon attacked Media, probably to establish control there and neutralize the region as a potential threat before confronting either Urartu or Elam. The local Medes were disunited and posed no serious threat to Assyria. After Sargon defeated them and established Assyrian provinces, he let the established local lords continue to rule their respective cities as vassals. Supplanting them and integrating the lands further into the imperial bureaucracy would have been costly and time-consuming due to their remoteness. As part of this eastern campaign, Sargon defeated some local rebels, including Bag-dati of Uishdish and Bel-sharru-usur of Kisheshim. In Mannaea, Ullusunu had succeeded in taking the throne from his brother Aza. Instead of deposing Ullusunu and proclaiming a new king, Sargon accepted Ullusunu&#x27;s submission and endorsed him as king, forgiving his uprising and gaining his allegiance.

=== Urartu–Assyria War ===
Urartu remained Sargon&#x27;s main strategic rival in the north. In 715, Urartu was severely weakened by an unsuccessful expedition against the Cimmerians, a nomadic people in the central Caucasus. The Cimmerians defeated the Urartian army and raided Urartian lands as far as immediately south-west of Lake Urmia. Ullusunu of Mannaea had switched by then his loyalty to Assyria. Rusa seized some of Ullusunu&#x27;s fortresses and replaced him with Daiukku as the new king. Months later, Sargon invaded Mannaea, recaptured Ullusunu&#x27;s fortresses and restored him to the throne. Rusa attempted to drive Sargon back, but his army was defeated in the foothills of Sahand. Sargon also received the tribute of Ianzu, king of Nairi, another former Urartian vassal. Preparing for a campaign against Rusa, Sargon defeated some minor rebels in Media. In Anatolia, Urik of Quwê, changed his allegiance from Sargon to Midas of Phrygia and began sending envoys to Rusa. To prevent the formation of a northern alliance, Sargon attacked Quwê, defeating Urik and recapturing some cities that had fallen to Midas. Quwê was abolished as a vassal kingdom and annexed.

Suspecting an Assyrian invasion, Rusa kept most of his army by Lake Urmia, close to the Assyrian border, which was already fortified against Assyrian invasion. The shortest path from Assyria to the Urartian heartland went through the &quot;Kel-i-šin&quot; pass in the Taurus Mountains. One of the most important places in all of Urartu, the holy city Musasir, was located just west of this pass and was protected by fortifications. Rusa ordered the construction of the &quot;Gerdesorah&quot;, a new fortress strategically positioned on a hill. The &quot;Gerdesorah&quot; was still under construction when the Assyrians invaded.
Sargon left the Assyrian capital of Nimrud in July 714. Rejecting the shortest route through the &quot;Kel-i-šin&quot; pass, Sargon marched his army through the valleys of the Great and Little Zab for three days before halting near Mount Kullar (the location of which remains unidentified). There Sargon chose a longer route through Kermanshah, probably since he knew the Urartians anticipated him attacking through the pass. The longer route delayed the Assyrians with mountains and greater distance. The campaign had to be completed before October, when the mountain passes would become blocked by snow. This meant that conquest, if that had been the intention, would not be possible.

Sargon reached Gilzanu, near Lake Urmia, and made camp. The Urartian forces regrouped and built new fortifications west and south of Lake Urmia. Though Sargon&#x27;s forces had been granted supplies and water by his vassals in Media, his troops were exhausted and nearly mutinous. When Rusa arrived, the Assyrian army refused to fight. Sargon assembled his bodyguards and led them in a near-suicidal charge against the nearest wing of the Urartian forces. Sargon&#x27;s army followed him, defeated the Urartians, and chased them west, far past Lake Urmia. Rusa abandoned his forces and fled into the mountains.

On their way home, the Assyrians destroyed the &quot;Gerdesorah&quot; and captured and plundered Musasir after the local governor, king Urzana, refused to welcome Sargon. An enormous quantity of spoils were carried back to Assyria. Urzana was forgiven and allowed to continue to govern Musasir as an Assyrian vassal. Though Urartu remained powerful and Rusa retook Musasir, the 714 campaign put an end to direct confrontations between Urartu and Assyria for the rest of Sargon&#x27;s reign. Sargon considered the campaign one of the major events of his reign. It was described in exceptional detail in his inscriptions and several of the reliefs in his palace were decorated with representations of the sack of Musasir.

=== Construction of Dur-Sharrukin ===
The foundations of Dur-Sharrukin (&quot;fortress of Sargon&quot;) were laid in 717. Dur-Sharrukin was built between the Husur river and Mount Musri, near the village of Magganabba, around northeast of Nineveh. The new city could use water from Mount Musri but the location otherwise lacked obvious practical or political merit. In one of his inscriptions, Sargon alluded to fondness for the foothills of Mount Musri: &quot;following the prompting of my heart, I built a city at the foot of Mount Musri, in the plain of Nineveh, and named it Dur-Sharrukin&quot;. Since no buildings had ever been constructed at the chosen location, previous architecture did not have to be taken into account and he conceived the new city as an &quot;ideal city&quot;, its proportions based on mathematical harmony. There were various numerical and geometrical correspondences between different aspects of the city and Dur-Sharrukin&#x27;s city walls formed a nearly perfect square.
The numerous surviving sources on the construction of the city include inscriptions carved on the walls of its buildings, reliefs depicting the process and over a hundred letters and other documents describing the work. The chief coordinator was Tab-shar-Ashur, Sargon&#x27;s chief treasurer, but at least twenty-six governors from across the empire were also associated with the construction; Sargon made the project a collaborative effort by the whole empire. Sargon took an active personal interest in the progress and frequently intervened in nearly all aspects of the work, from commenting on architectural details to overseeing material transportation and the recruitment of labor. Sargon&#x27;s frequent input and efforts to encourage more work is probably the main reason for how the city could be completed so fast and efficiently. Sargon&#x27;s encouragement was at times lenient, particularly when dealing with grumbling among the workers, but at other times threatening. One of his letters to the governor of Nimrud, requesting building materials, reads as follows:

Dur-Sharrukin reflected Sargon&#x27;s self-image and how he wished the empire to see him. At about three square kilometers (1.2 square miles), the city was one of the largest in antiquity. The city&#x27;s palace, which Sargon called a &quot;palace without rival&quot;, was built on a huge artificial platform on the northern side of the city astride the wall, as was typical of Neo-Assyrian palaces, and was fortified with a wall of its own. At 100,000 square meters (10 hectares; 25 acres), it was the largest Assyrian palace ever built. The palace itself occupied three quarters of the citadel it was constructed on, while temples and the ziggurat were relegated to a single corner. It was richly decorated with reliefs, statues, glazed bricks and stone &quot;lamassus&quot; (human-headed bulls). Other prominent structures in the city included temples, a building in the southwest called the arsenal (&quot;ekal mâšarti&quot;), and a great park, which included exotic plants from throughout the empire. The city&#x27;s surrounding wall was high and thick, reinforced at 15-meter (49 ft) intervals with more than two hundred bastions. The internal wall was named Ashur, the external wall Ninurta, the city&#x27;s seven gates Shamash, Adad, Enlil, Anu, Ishtar, Ea and Belet-ili after gods of the Mesopotamian pantheon.

=== Further minor conflicts ===

In the years following the campaign against Urartu, Sargon worked to retain the loyalty of his northern vassals and to curb the influence of Elam; though Elam itself did not pose a threat towards Assyria, it would not be possible to reconquer Babylonia without first breaking Marduk-apla-iddina&#x27;s alliance with the Elamites. In 713, Sargon campaigned in the Zagros Mountains again, defeating a revolt in the land of Karalla, meeting with Ullusunu of Mannaea and receiving some tribute. In the same year, Sargon sent his &quot;turtanu&quot; (commander-in-chief) to help Talta of Ellipi, an Assyrian vassal west of the Zagros Mountains. Sargon probably considered it important to keep good relations with Ellipi since it was a key buffer state between Assyria and Elam. Talta was threatened by a revolt, but after Assyrian intervention he retained his throne.

Rusa still intended to extend Urartian influence into southern Anatolia despite Sargon&#x27;s 714 victory. In 713 Sargon campaigned against Tabal in southern Anatolia again, trying to secure the kingdom&#x27;s natural resources (mainly silver and wood, required for the construction of Dur-Sharrukin) and to prevent Urartu from establishing control and contacting Phrygia. Sargon used a divide and rule approach in Tabal; territory was distributed between the different Tabalian rulers to prevent any one of them from growing strong enough to present a problem. Sargon also encouraged the loose hegemony of the strongest Tabalian state, Bit-Purutash (sometimes called &quot;Tabal proper&quot; by modern historians), over the other Tabalian rulers. The king of Bit-Purutash, Ambaris, was granted Sargon&#x27;s daughter Ahat-Abisha in marriage and some additional territory. This strategy was not successful; Ambaris began conspiring with the other rulers of Tabal and with Rusa and Midas. Sargon deposed Ambaris, deporting him to Assyria, and annexed Tabal.

The Philistine city of Ashdod rebelled under its king Azuri in 713, and was crushed by Sargon or one of his generals. Azuri was replaced as king by Ahi-Miti. In 712 the vassal king Tarhunazi of Kammanu in northern Syria rebelled against Assyria, seeking to ally with Midas. Tarhunazi had been placed on his throne during Sargon&#x27;s 720 campaign in the Levant. This revolt was dealt with by Sargon&#x27;s &quot;turtanu&quot;; Tarhunazi was defeated and his lands were annexed. His capital, Melid, was given to Mutallu of Kummuh. Mutallu was a trusted ally since the kings of Kummuh had long maintained good relations with the Assyrian court. After the Assyrian army defeated a revolt by the kingdom of Gurgum in 711 and it was annexed, Sargon&#x27;s control of southern Anatolia became relatively stable. Shortly after Sargon&#x27;s victory, Ashdod revolted again. The locals deposed Ahi-Miti and in his stead proclaimed a noble named Yamani as king. In 712, Yamani approached Judah and Egypt for an alliance but the Egyptians refused Yamani&#x27;s offer, maintaining good relations with Sargon. After the Assyrians defeated Yamani in 711 and Ashdod was destroyed, Yamani escaped to Egypt and was extradited to Assyria by Pharaoh Shebitku in 707.

=== Reconquest of Babylonia ===

In 710, Sargon decided to reconquer Babylonia. To justify the impending expedition, Sargon proclaimed that the Babylonian national deity Marduk had commanded him to liberate the south from the evil Marduk-apla-iddina. Though Babylonia and Elam still maintained good relations, the military alliance between the two had disintegrated. Sargon used diplomacy to convince cities and tribes within Babylonia to betray Marduk-apla-iddina. Through secret negotiations, several tribes and cities in northern Babylonia were won over, including the city of Sippar and the tribes Bit-Dakkuri and Bit-Amukkani.

Sargon invaded Babylonia by marching alongside the eastern bank of the river Tigris until he reached the city of Dur-Athara, which had been fortified by Marduk-apla-iddina (moving also the entire Gambulu tribe, an Aramean people, into it), but was quickly defeated and renamed Dur-Nabu. Sargon created a new province surrounding the city, Gambulu. Dur-Athara might have been seized specifically to prevent the Elamites from sending any significant aid to Marduk-apla-iddina. Sargon spent some time at Dur-Athara, sending his soldiers on expeditions to the east and south to convince cities and tribes to submit to his rule. Sargon&#x27;s forces defeated a contingent of Aramean and Elamite soldiers by a river referred to as the Uknu. Once Sargon crossed the Tigris and one of the branches of the Euphrates and arrived at the city Dur-Ladinni, near Babylon, Marduk-apla-iddina became frightened. He may have had little support from the people and priesthood of Babylon or had lost most of his army at Dur-Athara. Marduk-apla-iddina fled to Elam, where he unsuccessfully petitioned King Shutruk-Nahhunte II for aid.

After Marduk-apla-iddina&#x27;s departure, Sargon met little opposition on his march south. The people of Babylon opened the gates with enthusiasm and he made a triumphal entry. Elayi speculated in 2017 that Sargon may have made an agreement with the city&#x27;s priests, who might have preferred Assyrian rule over a Chaldean king. After some ceremonies in the city, Sargon relocated with his army to Kish to continue the war and suppress remaining resistance. Marduk-apla-iddina returned to Mesopotamia, taking up residence in his home city of Dur-Yakin and continuing to resist.

Dur-Yakin was fortified, a great ditch was dug surrounding its walls, and the surrounding countryside was flooded through a canal dug from the Euphrates. Guarded by the flooded terrain, Marduk-apla-iddina set up his camp outside the city walls. His forces were defeated by Sargon&#x27;s army, which had crossed through the flooded terrain unimpeded. Marduk-apla-iddina fled into the city as the Assyrians began collecting spoils of war from his fallen soldiers. Sargon besieged Dur-Yakin but was unable to take the city. As the siege dragged on, negotiations were started and in 709 it was agreed that the city would surrender and tear down its exterior walls in exchange for Sargon sparing Marduk-apla-iddina&#x27;s life. Marduk-apla-iddina, along with his family and supporters, were granted passage to Elam to live in exile.

=== Last years ===

After he took Babylon in 710, Sargon was proclaimed king of Babylon by the citizens of the city and spent the next three years in Babylon, in Marduk-apla-iddina&#x27;s palace. Affairs in Assyria were in these years overseen by Sargon&#x27;s son Sennacherib. Sargon participated in the annual Babylonian &quot;Akitu&quot; (New Years) festival and received homage and gifts from rulers of lands as far away from the heartland of his empire as Bahrain and Cyprus. Sargon engaged himself in various domestic affairs in Babylonia, digging a new canal from Borsippa to Babylon and defeating a people called the Hamaranaeans that had been plundering caravans near Sippar. In Sargon&#x27;s inscriptions from this time, he used some traditionally Babylonian elements in his royal titles and frequently mentioned deities popular in Babylonia rather than those popular in Assyria. Some Assyrians, even members of the royal family, disagreed with Sargon&#x27;s pro-Babylonian attitude.

In Sargon&#x27;s absence, developments in the rest of the empire were dealt with by his officials and generals. Midas of Phrygia remained a threat to Assyrian interests; to ensure that communication and trade remained open to Assyrian vassals in Anatolia, the Assyrians carefully monitored him. In 709, the Assyrian governor of Quwê, Ashur-sharru-usur personally resolved to end the Phrygian threat. His raids into Phrygia and the capture of a mountain fortress, perhaps Hilakku, frightened Midas, who willingly became Sargon&#x27;s vassal.
In 709, Assyria sent an expedition to Cyprus. This was the first time that the Assyrians gained detailed knowledge of the island. Sargon did not personally participate in the campaign and the Assyrians relied on their Levantine vassals for transportation. Because Cyprus was far away, actually controlling the island would have been difficult, but the campaign resulted in several Cypriote rulers paying tribute to Sargon. After the departure of the expedition, the Cypriotes, probably with the aid of an Assyrian stonemason sent by the royal court, fashioned the Sargon Stele. The stele was an ideological marker indicating the boundary of the Assyrian king&#x27;s sphere of influence and to mark the incorporation of Cyprus into the Assyrians&#x27; &quot;known world&quot;. Since it had the king&#x27;s image and words on it, it served as a representation of Sargon and a substitute for his presence.

In 709, one of Sargon&#x27;s officers besieged the Phoenician city of Tyre after its leader refused to ally with Assyria. It proved to be one of the few military blunders of Sargon&#x27;s time; the city resisted the Assyrians for several years until Sargon&#x27;s death, after which the Assyrian army left. In 708, Mutallu of Kummuh withheld his tribute to Assyria for unknown reasons and allied with the new Urartian king Argishti II. Sargon sent one of his officers to capture Kummuh. The Assyrians heavily plundered Kummuh and annexed its lands. Mutallu survived, probably escaping to Urartu.

Dur-Sharrukin was completed in 707 after a decade of construction. Sargon returned to Assyria to prepare the city&#x27;s inauguration. A year later, he moved the royal court to Dur-Sharrukin. The inauguration began with Sargon &quot;inviting the gods&quot; to Dur-Sharrukin, placing statues of various gods in the city&#x27;s temples. Sargon invited &quot;princes of (all) countries, the governors of my land, scribes and superintendents, nobles, officials and elders of Assyria&quot; to a great feast. The common people who had helped build the city were also invited to partake in the celebration, dining in the same hall as the king. Already shortly after its inauguration, the new capital was densely populated.

=== Final campaign and death ===

Few sources survive describing Sargon&#x27;s final campaign and death. Based on the Assyrian Eponym List and the Babylonian Chronicles, the most likely course of events is that Sargon embarked to campaign against Tabal, which had risen up against him, in the early summer of 705. This campaign was the last of several attempts to bring Tabal under Assyrian control. It is not clear why Sargon resolved to lead the expedition against Tabal in person, considering the large number of campaigns led by his officials and generals. Tabal was not a real threat against the Assyrian Empire. Elayi believes that the most likely explanation is that Sargon saw the expedition as an interesting diversion from the quiet court life of Dur-Sharrukin.

Sargon&#x27;s final campaign ended in disaster. Somewhere in Anatolia, Gurdî of Kulumma, an otherwise poorly attested figure, attacked the Assyrian camp. Gurdî has variously been assumed to have been a local ruler in Anatolia or a tribal leader of the Cimmerians, during this time allied with the rebels in Tabal. In the ensuing battle, Sargon was killed. The Assyrian soldiers fleeing from the attack were unable to recover the king&#x27;s body. Sargon died just over a year after the inauguration of Dur-Sharrukin.

== Family and children ==

In addition to Shalmaneser V probably being Sargon&#x27;s brother, Sargon had a younger brother, Sin-ahu-usur (&quot;Sîn-ahu-usur&quot;), who was by 714 the commander of Sargon&#x27;s royal cavalry guard. After the inauguration of Dur-Sharrukin in 706, he was granted his own residence in the new capital. He appears to have held the influential position of grand vizier.

Two wives of Sargon are known: Ra&#x27;ima (&quot;Ra&#x27;īmâ&quot;) and Atalia (&quot;Ataliā&quot;). Atalia was Sargon&#x27;s queen; her tomb was discovered in Nimrud in 1989. The general assumption among researchers is that Assyrian kings could have multiple wives, but only one woman at a time could be recognized as queen. Sennacherib was once believed to have been Atalia&#x27;s son, but he is now known to have been the son of Ra&#x27;ima, since a stele from Assur, translated in 2014, explicitly refers to Ra&#x27;ima as his mother. There is no evidence that Ra&#x27;ima was ever Sargon&#x27;s queen. Atalia is believed to have outlived Sargon and her remains found in 1989 indicate that she was aged approximately 30–35 at the time of death. Ra&#x27;ima must have been significantly older than Atalia given that she gave birth to Sennacherib 745. It is possible that Ra&#x27;ima also outlived Sargon since an inscription written by Sennacherib 692 BC references her, though it might have been written after her death.

Sargon had at least two sons before Sennacherib was born, though they died prior to Sennacherib&#x27;s birth, indicated by Sennacherib&#x27;s name, &quot;Sîn-ahhī-erība&quot; in Akkadian, meaning &quot;[the god] Sîn has replaced the brothers&quot;. Like Sennacherib, the older sons were presumably sons of Ra&#x27;ima. Sennacherib, who succeeded Sargon as king (705–681), was an adult at the time of Sargon&#x27;s accession. He was named crown prince early in Sargon&#x27;s reign and assisted his father in running the empire; he helped collect and summarize intelligence reports from the Assyrian spy network. Sargon had at least two children younger than Sennacherib, though their names are unknown. Their existence is indicated by a letter from Sargon&#x27;s reign mentioning &quot;Sennacherib, the crown prince ... [and all] the princes/children of the king (who are) [in] Assyria&quot;. Sargon&#x27;s only known daughter was Ahat-Abisha (&quot;Ahat-Abiša&quot;), who married Ambaris of Tabal. When Ambaris was dethroned by Sargon in 713, Ahat-Abisha probably returned to Assyria.

== Character ==

=== Warrior-king ===

Sargon II was a warrior-king and conqueror who commanded his armies in person and dreamt of conquering the world like Sargon of Akkad. Sargon assumed traditional Mesopotamian titles relating to world domination, such as &quot;king of the universe&quot; and &quot;king of the four corners of the world&quot;, and great power, including &quot;great king&quot; and &quot;mighty king&quot;. Although Neo-Assyrian kings&#x27; titles were formulaic, they typically used additional epithets to highlight their unique qualities and aspirations. Sargon&#x27;s epithets present him as if he were an invincible warlord, for example, &quot;mighty hero, clothed with terror, who sends forth his weapon to bring low the foe, brave warrior, since the day of whose (accession) to rulership, there has been no prince equal to him, who has been without conqueror or rival&quot;. Sargon wished to be seen as an omnipresent and eager warrior. Sargon is unlikely to have fought on the frontlines in all campaigns since this would greatly have jeopardized the empire, but it is clear that he was more interested in participating in war than his predecessors and successors and he did eventually die in battle.

Sargon was a highly successful military strategist who employed an extensive spy network, useful for administration and military activities, and employed well-trained scouts for reconnaissance when on campaign. Even though the Assyrian Empire was vastly more powerful than any of its enemies, these enemies also surrounded the empire. Because only one target could be attacked at a time, they had to be picked wisely in order to avoid disaster. Sargon outwitted his enemies on multiple occasions, for instance through the unexpected route he took in the war with Urartu. Sargon&#x27;s ability to quickly react and adapt to setbacks distinguished him from his predecessors. Sargon also strengthened the Assyrian army; he was the first Assyrian king to appreciate the war potential of cavalry and made various innovations, including picking certain breeds of horses, developing new methods of harnessing and recruiting mercenary cavalry. Based on the contents of his letters, Sargon seems to have ensured discipline and obedience through fear rather than inspiration or adoration. When raising troops, he at times threatened them with the same type of punishments enacted against Assyria&#x27;s worst enemies, should they disobey him.


Unlike the numerous records of such punishments against Assyrian enemies, there is no evidence that Sargon&#x27;s threats were realized—it is unlikely that they ever were. Because the soldiers in many cases had themselves participated in punishments against their enemies, the threats themselves were probably sufficient. Despite this approach, Sargon was not unpopular with the military; there are no records of army uprisings against him, nor of any army officers engaging in conspiracies. It is also probable that the main motivating factor for Assyrians serving in the army was not being threatened by the king, but rather the frequent spoils of war that could be taken after victories.

=== Quest for renown ===

Nearly all Assyrian kings wished to outdo their predecessors and be remembered as glorious rulers. Sargon aspired to surpass all previous kings, even Sargon of Akkad. He established and cultivated his own cult of personality, for instance through having stelae made with depictions of him as a formidable king and placing these across the empire, often in highly visible places such as frequented passageways. In his palace in Dur-Sharrukin, Sargon decorated the walls with reliefs depicting himself and his achievements. He hoped that future generations would regard him as one of the greatest kings.

Sargon&#x27;s aspiration for renown is also reflected in Dur-Sharrukin, which was likely founded mainly as an ideological statement given its location&#x27;s lack of obvious merit. Perhaps inspired by Sargon of Akkad being credited as the founder of the city of Akkad, Sargon II built Dur-Sharrukin for his own glory and intended the city, and his various other building works, to preserve his memory for generations to come. The inscriptions in Dur-Sharrukin evoke Sargon&#x27;s desire to initiate a golden age and to mark the beginning of a new world order. They also condemn those who would destroy Sargon&#x27;s works and encourage future kings to honor his memory.

In addition to Sargon of Akkad, another figure idolized by Sargon II was the ancient Sumerian ruler Gilgamesh, chiefly known in Sargon&#x27;s time through the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. In several surviving texts, Sargon II&#x27;s feats were implicitly compared to the legend. In Sargon&#x27;s inscriptions, the campaign against Urartu includes portions where it seems that Sargon is fighting not only the Urartians but also the landscape itself. A section where the mountains are described as if they are rising up as swords and spears to oppose Sargon&#x27;s advance would probably have reminded Assyrian readers of a similar section in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, implying that Sargon faced dangers equal to those of the ancient hero. A giant relief at Dur-Sharrukin depicts a muscular man holding a lion to his chest. Though the relief bears no inscription that proves its identity, scholars generally identify it as a depiction of Gilgamesh. In the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, Gilgamesh, though failing to gain actual immortality, achieves a type of immortality through his creation of an impressive wall surrounding Uruk, a building work that will outlast him and perpetuate his memory.

=== Guardian of justice ===

Sargon titled himself a &quot;guardian of justice&quot; and considered himself to be divinely mandated to &quot;maintain justice and right&quot;, &quot;give guidance to those who are not strong&quot; and &quot;not to injure the weak&quot;. Sargon worked to ensure the protection and security of the people who lived under his rule.

Under Tiglath-Pileser III, Assyrian efforts to assimilate and incorporate conquered foreign peoples had begun in earnest. Sargon continued and extended this policy, putting foreigners on the same footing as the original Assyrian population. Sargon&#x27;s accounts of conquests explicitly mention that he placed the same taxes on the people of the new territories as he did on the people in the Assyrian heartland. Sargon also encouraged assimilation, cultural mixture and the teaching, rather than forceful imposition, of Assyrian ways of life. One of the passages in an account of Dur-Sharrukin&#x27;s construction for instance reads:

The power and influence of the women at the royal court was increased in Sargon&#x27;s reign. He created new military units subservient to the queen, which grew in size and diversity under Sargon&#x27;s successors. These units were part of the military might of the empire and participated in campaigns. Sargon&#x27;s motivation is not known, but perhaps he wanted to reduce the influence of powerful officials by delegating authority and responsibilities to trusted relatives, including women. The office of &quot;turtanu&quot; was split into two, one being assigned to the forces of the queen.

In Assyrian royal ideology, the Assyrian king was the divinely appointed mortal representative of Ashur. The king was seen as having the moral, humane and necessary obligation to extend Assyria since lands outside Assyria were regarded to be uncivilized and a threat to the cosmic and divine order within the Assyrian Empire. Expansionism was thus cast as a moral duty to convert chaos to civilization. Resistance against Assyrian rule was seen as fighting against divine will; rebels and enemies were criminals against the divine world order, deserving punishment. Though some atrocities are recorded in Sargon&#x27;s inscriptions, including &quot;filling the mountain valleys&quot; with the bodies of enemy soldiers and gouging out the eyes of prisoners, Sargon&#x27;s inscriptions do not appear to contain much overt sadism (unlike the inscriptions of some other kings, such as Ashurnasirpal II). Atrocities enacted by Assyrian kings were in most known cases directed only towards soldiers and elites; as of 2016 none of the known inscriptions or reliefs of Sargon mention or show harm being done to civilians. Unlike virtually all other Assyrian kings, Sargon did not solely exert dominion through aggression, but maintained good relations with several foreign ruling classes and external kings, rewarded loyal vassals, worked to seal alliances, and several times spared and forgave repentant enemies.

Sargon saw himself as exceptionally intelligent, more so than any of his predecessors. It is probable that he received the usual education of the Assyrian upper class, learning both Akkadian and Sumerian, as well as some arithmetic. Sargon was perhaps also educated in art or literature; he built a library in his palace and covered the palace walls in artwork. Sargon heavily promoted writing and scribal culture; court scholars became more prominent in Sargon&#x27;s reign than both before and after. Over a thousand cuneiform letters are known from Sargon&#x27;s time, more than from the reigns of his three successors combined.

== Legacy ==

=== Sargon forgotten ===

Sargon&#x27;s legacy in ancient Assyria was severely damaged by the manner of his death; in particular, the failure to recover his body was a major psychological blow for Assyria. The shock and theological implications plagued the reigns of his successors for decades. The ancient Assyrians believed that unburied dead became ghosts that could come back and haunt the living. Sargon was believed to be doomed to a miserable afterlife; his ghost would wander the Earth, eternally restless and hungry. Soon after the news of Sargon&#x27;s death reached the Assyrian heartland, the influential advisor and scribe Nabu-zuqup-kena copied Tablet XII of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. This tablet contains a section eerily similar to Sargon&#x27;s death, with the miserable implications described in detail, which must have left the scribe stunned and distressed. In the Levant, Sargon&#x27;s hubris was mocked. It is believed that a foreign ruler chided in the Biblical Book of Isaiah is based on Sargon.

Sennacherib was horrified by his father&#x27;s death. The Assyriologist Eckart Frahm believes that Sennacherib was so deeply affected that he began suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. Sennacherib was unable to acknowledge and mentally deal with what had transpired. Sargon&#x27;s dishonorable death in battle and his lack of a burial was seen as a sign that he must have committed some serious and unforgivable sin that made the gods completely abandon him. Sennacherib concluded that Sargon had perhaps offended Babylon&#x27;s gods by taking control of the city.

Sennacherib did everything he could to distance himself from Sargon and never wrote or built anything to honor Sargon&#x27;s memory. One of his first building projects was restoring a temple dedicated to Nergal, god of the underworld, perhaps intended to pacify a deity possibly involved with Sargon&#x27;s fate. Sennacherib also moved the capital to Nineveh, despite the fact that Dur-Sharrukin was entirely new and built to house the royal court. Given that Sargon modelled parts of his reign on Gilgamesh, Frahm believes that it is possible that Sennacherib abandoned Dur-Sharrukin on account of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. The furious and hungry spirit of a mighty king might have been feared to mean that Sennacherib would be unable to hold court there. Sennacherib spent a lot of time and effort to rid the empire of Sargon&#x27;s imagery and work. Images Sargon had created at the temple in Assur were made invisible through raising the level of the courtyard and Sargon&#x27;s queen Atalia was buried hastily when she died, without regard to traditional burial practices and in the same coffin as another woman. Despite this, Sennacherib attempted to avenge his father, sending an expedition to Tabal in 704 to kill Gurdî and perhaps retrieve Sargon&#x27;s body; whether it was successful is not known.

After Sennacherib&#x27;s reign, Sargon was sometimes mentioned as the ancestor of later kings. Assyria fell in the late 7th century BC. Though the local population of northern Mesopotamia never forgot ancient Assyria, knowledge of Assyria in Western Europe throughout the centuries thereafter derived from the writings of classical authors and the Bible. Due to the efforts of Sennacherib, Sargon was poorly remembered by the time these works were written. Sargon was obscure in Assyriology prior to the rediscovery of Dur-Sharrukin in the 19th century. His name appears once in the Bible (Isaiah 20.1). Many Assyriological commentators were puzzled by the name&#x27;s appearance in the Bible and believed that Sargon was merely an alias for one of the better-known kings, typically Shalmaneser, Sennacherib or Esarhaddon.

=== Sargon rediscovered ===
European explorers and archaeologists first began excavations in northern Mesopotamia in the early 19th century. Around this time some scholars placed Sargon as a distinct king between Shalmaneser and Sennacherib. Dur-Sharrukin was found by chance; Paul-Émile Botta was conducting excavations at Nineveh when he heard about it from locals in 1843. Under Botta and his assistant Victor Place, virtually the entire palace was excavated, as were portions of the surrounding town. In 1847, the first-ever exhibition on Assyrian sculptures was held in the Louvre, composed of finds from Sargon&#x27;s palace. Botta&#x27;s report on his findings, published in 1849, garnered exceptional interest. Though much of what was excavated at Dur-Sharrukin was left in situ, reliefs and other artifacts have been exhibited across the world, including the Louvre, the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago and the Iraq Museum.

In 1845, Isidore Löwenstern was the first to suggest that Sargon was the builder of Dur-Sharrukin, although he based this identification on erroneous readings of cuneiform. After cuneiform was deciphered, archaeologist Adrien Prévost de Longpérier confirmed the king&#x27;s name to be Sargon in 1847. Discussions and debate continued for several years and Sargon was not fully accepted by Assyriologists as a distinct king until the 1860s. Through the large number of sources left behind from his time, Sargon is better known than many of his predecessors and successors, and than the ancient Sargon of Akkad. Modern Assyriologists consider Sargon to have been one of the most important Assyrian kings given the substantial expansion of Assyrian territory undertaken in his reign and his political and military reforms. Sargon left a stable and strong empire, though it proved difficult to control by his successors. Sennacherib had to face several revolts against his rule, some of them motivated by the manner of Sargon&#x27;s death, though they were all eventually defeated. Elayi assessed Sargon in 2017 as &quot;the real founder of the empire&quot; and a man who &quot;succeeded in everything in his life, but completely failed in his death&quot;. Since the early 20th century, Sargon has also been a common name among modern Assyrian people.

== Titles ==
The Sargon Stele from Cyprus gives Sargon the following titles:

In an account of restoration work done to Ashurnasirpal II&#x27;s palace in Nimrud (written before Sargon&#x27;s reconquest of Babylonia), Sargon used the following longer titulature:

<text>Cambrai (, ; ; ), formerly Cambray and historically in English Camerick or Camericke, is a city in the Nord department and in the Hauts-de-France region of France on the Scheldt river, which is known locally as the Escaut river.

A sub-prefecture of the department, Cambrai is a town which had 32,501 inhabitants in 2018. It is in the heart of the urban unit of Cambrai with 46,772 inhabitants. Its functional area, a more extensive range, included 94,576 inhabitants in 2018. With Lille and the towns of the former Nord-Pas de Calais Mining Basin, it is also part of the which has more than 3.8 million inhabitants.

Towards the end of the Roman Empire, Cambrai replaced Bavay as the &quot;capital&quot; of the land of the Nervii. At the beginning of the Merovingian era, Cambrai became the seat of an immense archdiocese covering all the right bank of the Scheldt and the centre of a small ecclesiastical principality, roughly coinciding with the shire of Brabant, including the central part of the Low Countries. The bishopric had some limited secular power and depended on the Holy Roman Empire until annexation to France in 1678. Fénelon, nicknamed the &quot;Swan of Cambrai&quot;, was the most renowned of the archbishops.

The fertile lands which surround it and the textile industry gave it prosperity in the Middle Ages, but in modern times it is less industrialised than its neighbours of Nord-Pas-de-Calais.

Cambrai was the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s headquarters, for the British Army of Occupation, from 1815 to 1818. Occupied by the German army during World War I, Cambrai suffered partial destruction in the First Battle of Cambrai from British artillery attacks on the town, including the nearby Bourlon Wood. The fighting around Cambrai, known as the Battle of Cambrai (20 November 1917 – 3 December 1917) is notable in that it is considered to be the first mass use of tanks in battle. A second Battle of Cambrai took place between 8 and 10 October 1918 as part of the Hundred Days Offensive. World War II was followed by reconstructions and a rapidly developing economy and population, abruptly reversed by the 1973 oil crisis.

Cambrai today is a lively city and, despite the past destruction, maintains a rich monumental heritage. Cambrai is affirmed as the urban centre of Cambrésis. Its economic life is strengthened by its position on the main local highway and river.

==History==
===Antiquity===

Little is known with certainty of the beginnings of Cambrai. &quot;Camaracum&quot; or &quot;Camaraco&quot;, as it was known to the Romans, is mentioned for the first time on the Peutinger table in the middle of the 4th century. It became the main town of the Roman province of the Nervii, whose first Roman capital had been at &quot;Bagacum&quot;, present-day Bavay.

In the middle of the 4th-century, Frankish raids from the north threatened Bavay and led the Romans to build forts along the Cologne to Bavay to Cambrai road, and thence to Boulogne. Cambrai thus occupied an important strategic position.

In 430, the Salian Franks under the command of Clodio the Long-Haired took the town. In 509, Clovis undertook to unify the Frankish kingdoms by getting rid of his relatives.

===Middle Ages===
Cambrai began to grow from a rural market into a real city during the Merovingian times, a long period of peace when the bishoprics of Arras and Cambrai were first unified (probably owing to the small number of clerics left at the time) and were later transferred to Cambrai, an administrative centre for the region. Successive bishops, including Gaugericus (in French Géry), founded abbeys and churches to host relics, which contributed powerfully to giving Cambrai both the appearance and functions of a city.

When the Treaty of Verdun in 843 split Charlemagne&#x27;s empire into three parts, the county of Cambrai fell into Lothaire&#x27;s kingdom. However, upon the death of Lothair II, who had no heir, king Charles the Bald tried to gain control of his kingdom by having himself consecrated at Metz. Cambrai thus reverted, but only briefly, to the Western Frankish Realm. In 870 the town was destroyed by the Normans.

In the Middle Ages the region around Cambrai, called Cambrésis, was a county. Rivalries between the count, who ruled the city and county, and the bishop, ceased when in 948 Otto I granted the bishop with temporal powers over the city. In 1007, Emperor Henry II extended the bishop&#x27;s temporal power to the territory surrounding Cambrai. The bishops then had both spiritual and temporal powers. This made Cambrai and Cambrésis a church principality, much like Liège, an independent state which was part of the Holy Roman Empire. The spiritual power of the bishop was exercised over a vast diocese, which stretched on the right bank of the Scheldt to Mons, Brussels and Antwerp. In 954, the Magyars under Bulcsú besieged Cambrai, which resisted all their attacks.

In 958 one of the first communal uprisings in Europe occurred in Cambrai. The inhabitants rebelled against Bishop Bérenger&#x27;s power and abuses. The rebellion was severely repressed, but the discontent flared up again in the 10th and 11th centuries. Between 1077 and 1215, the burghers had a charter franchise on at least four occasions. Each time, these were eventually withdrawn by the combined efforts of the bishops and emperors. In 1227, following another period of unrest, the burghers of Cambrai finally had to give up their charters and accept the bishop&#x27;s authority. However, the &quot;Loi Godefroid&quot; promulgated by the bishop, in fact or in law, left the people a number of freedoms won in the management of communal affairs.

Cambrai is also known for its Irish homily.

====Economic activity====

In the Middle Ages, the city grew richer and larger thanks to its weaving industry which produced woollen cloth, linen and cambric. Cambrai, and in particular the drapery, experienced an economic decline from the 15th century. Cambrai then belonged to a commercial hansa of seventeen low country cities whose aim was to develop trade with the fairs in Champagne and Paris. By the 11th century the city walls had reached the circumference they would keep until the 19th century.

====Music history====

Cambrai has a distinguished musical history, particularly in the 15th century. The cathedral there, a musical centre until the 17th century, had one of the most active musical establishments in the Low Countries; many composers of the Burgundian School either grew up and learned their craft there, or returned to teach. In 1428, Philippe de Luxembourg claimed that the cathedral was the finest in all of Christianity, for the fineness of its singing, its light, and the sweetness of its bells. Guillaume Dufay, the most famous European musician of the 15th century, studied at the cathedral from 1409 to 1412 under Nicolas Malin and Richard Loqueville, and returned in 1439 after spending many years in Italy. Cambrai cathedral had other famous composers in the later 15th century: Johannes Tinctoris and Ockeghem went to Cambrai to study with Dufay. Other composers included Nicolas Grenon, Alexander Agricola, and Jacob Obrecht. In the 16th century, Philippe de Monte, Johannes Lupi, and Jacobus de Kerle all worked there.

===Early Modern era===

As the economic centre of northern Europe moved away from Bruges, the area became poorer, with an associated period of cultural decline. However, the city&#x27;s neutrality and its position between the possessions of the Habsburg Empire and France made it the venue of several international negotiations, including the League of Cambrai, an alliance engineered in 1508 by Pope Julius II against the Republic of Venice, concluding in the . The alliance collapsed in 1510 when the Pope allied with Venice against his former ally France. The conflict is also referred to as the War of the League of Cambrai and lasted from 1508 to 1516. Cambrai was also the site of negotiations in 1529, concluding in the Paix des Dames, which led to France&#x27;s withdrawal from the War of the League of Cognac.

In 1595, the city was taken by the Spanish in the eighth and last French Wars of Religion.

In December 1623, the community of nuns of the English Benedictine Congregation was founded at Cambrai. Expelled in 1793 as a result of the French Revolution, its successor community in 1838 was Stanbrook Abbey, near Malvern and later Wass in Yorkshire.

In 1630, Richelieu, wishing to counter the power of the Emperor and Spain, renewed the alliance of France with the United Provinces. The main effort of France had to focus on the Spanish Netherlands, and a sharing plan was established with the Dutch, with France to receive the Hainaut, Cambrésis, Artois, a large part of Flanders and Luxembourg and the County of Namur. War was declared against Spain in 1635: It was followed by a long series of wars which, compounded by subsistence and epidemics, caused crises which would bruise the Cambrésis.

Mazarin tried unsuccessfully, in 1649, to seize the city, which was being besieged by Henri de Lorraine-Harcourt and the Vicomte de Turenne. A Spanish regiment, which came from Bouchain, succeeded in entering the city and the siege was lifted. In 1657, the Vicomte de Turenne captured Cambrai. Again 4,000 horsemen under the command of Condé, in the service of the Spain, manage to penetrate, and Turenne abandoned the city.

In 1666, in the greatest secrecy, Louis XIV prepared new conquests by making plans of the Spanish fortifications, and then began the War of Devolution. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle from 1668 allowed the Kingdom of France to obtain a large number of strongholds, but Cambrai was not a part of them, nor were Bouchain, Valenciennes or Condé-sur-l&#x27;Escaut.

====The annexation by France====
In 1672, hostilities resumed against the Protestant Republic of the Netherlands and continued in the following years. In 1676, Louis XIV, in an effort to &quot;safeguard the tranquility of his borders for ever&quot; (&quot;assurer à jamais le repos de ses frontières&quot;), focused most of his efforts against Spain and occupied Condé and Bouchain. On 17 March 1677, the French troops stormed Valenciennes and moved toward Cambrai, the strongest place of the Netherlands, which was reached on 20 March. On 22 March, Louis XIV was in the city in person. On 2 April, the French invested in a part of the place. By 5 April, the city surrendered, given the same benefits as Lille in 1667, but the Spanish garrison took refuge in the citadel and the siege continued until 17 April. After 29 days of siege the king made his entry into the city, on 19 April, Easter Monday. Louis XIV named the Marquis de Cesen as governor, and appointed 14 new aldermen while keeping the same provost.

===The French Revolution===
The city suffered from the Revolution: Joseph Le Bon, sent by the Comité de salut public, arrived in Cambrai in 1794. He was to set up an era of &quot;terror&quot;, sending many to the guillotine, until he was tried and executed in 1795. One of his most famous victims was François III Maximilien de la Woestyne, 3rd Marquess of Becelaere.

Most of the religious buildings of the city were demolished in that period: in 1797, the old cathedral, which had been dubbed the &quot;wonder of the low countries&quot;, was sold to a merchant on 6 June 1796 who left only the tower, after exploiting the cathedral as a stone quarry. The main tower was left standing until 1809, when it collapsed in a storm. However the cathedral&#x27;s archives have been preserved (they are now at the Archives Départementales du Nord in Lille) and a new cathedral was later provided.

===19th century===
The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 widely spared Cambrai. It also showed the futility of the fortifications, which the city obtained permission to demolish, at its expense, in 1892. The outer boulevards were constructed and off to the location of the walls, between 1894 and the beginning of the 20th century. The appearance of the city was radically transformed, and the works stimulated the city&#x27;s economy.

===20th century===
In 1914, the German army occupied the city. This occupation, which lasted for four years, was marked by scenes of looting, requisitions and arrests of hostages. From 20 November to 17 December 1917, the vicinity of the town of Cambrai was the theatre of the Battle of Cambrai, which saw the massive use of tanks for the first time.

In 1918, the Germans burned the city centre before leaving, destroying the city hall and the municipal archives. In total, more than 1,500 buildings were totally destroyed, of the 3,500 which consisted of Cambrai. The centre was to be rebuilt, a task which was entrusted to the architect .

World War II also struck Cambrai. The city was bombed by the Luftwaffe on 17 May 1940, during the Battle of France, before falling the next day at the same time as Saint-Quentin. The remains of the 9th French Army and General Giraud were taken prisoner by the Germans.

From 27 April until 18 August 1944, 18 Allied air raids were directed against the railway tracks, killing 250 people and destroying 1,700 buildings, or more than 50% of the city. The first American tanks entered the city on 2 September.

After the war, the priority again was reconstruction. A municipality of the &quot;union of the left&quot; was elected in 1945, led by who would remain at the head of the city until 1981, promoting moderate socialism. As early as 1947, the city submitted to a development project of the Ministry of Reconstruction. The municipality gave priority to the construction of houses: The &quot;Maison du Cambrésis&quot; [House of le Cambrésis], later &quot;Maison Familiale&quot; group, an HLM cooperative society, contributed substantially to the reconstruction of the city. The population of the city increased, while the surrounding area tended to be depopulated. At the same time, the city lost industrial jobs and moved towards the tertiary sector, but it was public administrations which provided the bulk of jobs.

==Geography==
===Location===
The town of Cambrai is situated in the southern part of the Nord Department, of which it is chef-lieu of the arrondissement. It belongs to the dense network of the cities of the area which are separated by a few tens of kilometres: Douai is only away, Valenciennes is , Arras is and Saint-Quentin , all measured as the crow flies. The regional capital, Lille, is from Cambrai.

Cambrai is not very far from several European capitals: Brussels is away, Paris is and London is .

The city was born and developed on the right bank of the Scheldt river, locally known as the Escaut. The river has its source in the department of Aisne, just a little over away.

===Geology and landforms===
Cambrai is located on chalk bedrock of the Cretaceous period, which forms the northern boundary of the Paris Basin, between, to the east, the hills for Thiérache and Avesnois, the foothills of the , and northwest, the hills of Artois. It is at a point which is relatively lower than these two regions, called the &quot;Cambrai threshold&quot; or the &quot;Bapaume threshold&quot;, which facilitates the passage between the south and the north: Bapaume (Artois) is above sea level, Avesnes-sur-Helpe (Avesnois) is at and Cambrai only . The Saint-Quentin canal, the Canal du Nord, the A1, A2 and A26 autoroutes all borrow all this passage between the basin of the Seine and the plains of the Nord department.

The chalky subsoil allowed, as in many medieval cities, the digging of a network of cellars, tunnels and quarries under the city. The poor quality of the Cambrai chalk was reserved for use in the manufacture of lime or filling, as well as common constructions. For prestigious buildings, stone from the nearby villages of Noyelles-sur-Escaut, Rumilly or Marcoing was used.

The city is bordered in its western part, as well as to the north and the south, by the alluvial zones of the Scheldt Valley.

===Hydrography===
Cambrai is built on the right bank of the Scheldt. The river, still of a very modest flow in Cambrai, played a crucial role in the history of the city by providing multiple functions, including allowing the transportation of men and goods since antiquity. However, it was undeveloped and was crossed by numerous marshes. It was with the discovery of coal at Anzin in 1734 that the Scheldt was expanded and declared navigable in 1780, from Cambrai to the North Sea. The Scheldt is today the Canal de l&#x27;Escaut downstream of Cambrai.

In addition, the river initially served as the boundary between the bishoprics of Tournai on its left bank and Cambrai on its right bank, from the 6th century. When the division of Charlemagne&#x27;s Empire in 843, this border was retained to delimit the kingdoms of Lothair I and Charles the Bald, making Cambrai a city of the Holy Roman Empire until 1677.

The Scheldt was also indispensable to many economic activities, such as the tanning, milling, the manufacture of salt and soap, as well as for retting of linen, the weaving of which was one of the main activities of the city.

Finally, the river was used in the Middle Ages and then by Vauban, for the defence of the city by the establishment of flood defensive areas.

Despite its important role in the history of the city, the Scheldt is little integrated into the present urban landscape.

===Climate===
:Main article: &quot;&quot;

Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate). However, the city is about from the nearest coast.

Precipitation is distributed year-round, with highs in the spring and autumn, with February being the driest month. Contrasting with the rainy image of the region, the total annual precipitation is relatively small with at Cambrai-Épinoy; identical to the Montsouris Paris station, which is at the same altitude, it is less than those of Toulouse at or Nice at . However, the number of days of rain (63 in Nice, 120 in Cambrai) confirms the oceanic character of the climate.

The mean thermal amplitude between the winter and summer does not exceed 15 °C. Although again establishing a comparison with Paris, that Cambrai is 1.5 to 2 °C colder over all combined seasons. On average, there are 71 days of fog per year (Paris-Montsouris has 13) 15 days of storm (Paris-Montsouris has 19) and 20 days with snow (Paris-Montsouris has 15).

If comparing the data of Cambrai and those of towns such as Dunkirk or Boulogne, there are colder minimum temperatures and a warmer maximum in Cambrai, the difference being approximately 2 °C, as well as a larger number of freezing days and less heavy precipitation: It&#x27;s described a &quot;transitional&quot; oceanic climate, with some continental influences.

The temperature record in Cambrai is , which was established on 6 August 2003 (data collected since 1954 and record updated to 5 September 2013).

==Transport==
===Road===
Cambrai is located at the crossroads of two French autoroutes, the A2 from Combles (junction with the A1 coming from Paris) to the Franco-Belgian border, opened in 1973, and the A26 from Calais to Troyes, opened in 1992. These autoroutes partly merge with the European roads of the E19 from Amsterdam to Paris via Brussels, for the A2, and the E17 from Antwerp to Beaune via Lille and Reims, for the A26.

Cambrai and its region are served by four autoroute interchanges: The A2, exit 14 (Cambrai) from Paris and exit 15 (Bouchain) from Brussels, and on the A26 the exits 8 (Marquion) from Calais and 9 (Masnières) from Reims.

Cambrai is also at the crossroads of the Route nationale 30 of Bapaume to Quiévrain (Franco-Belgian border), Route nationale 43 of Sainte-Ruffine (Metz) to Calais, of Cambrai to Vitry (these last three have since 2006 been downgraded to and therefore consequently renamed to D6xx), and D939 (former ) of Cambrai to Arras.

To facilitate access to the east of the Cambrésis from the A2 and A26 autoroutes, to alleviate traffic in the crossing of the city and to serve the future Niergnies business zone, a southern bypass was the subject of a declaration of public utility (DPU) on 22 April 1999. Its route has been repeatedly modified and challenged, because it crosses the urban ecological park of the in Proville, the only public natural green space of the Cambrésis. The bypass is in service since 17 September 2010.

A bypass to the north is also part of the program of major departmental projects, which was required to have been initiated by 2011.

===Railway===
Cambrai railway station is connected by direct trains (TER) to Lille, Douai, Valenciennes, Saint-Quentin, and Reims.

The link to Douai and Lille has improved after the electrification of the single-track in 1993, for the commissioning of joining Paris to Cambrai by TGV via Douai, which was subsequently cancelled. Direct connections on weekdays are fifteen trains per day, with a journey time of about 30 minutes between Douai and Cambrai; eight trains, with a journey time often less than an hour, to Lille-Flandres station; ten trains, with a time of little more than 40 minutes on average to Valenciennes and a dozen trains, with a journey time of around 50 minutes, to Saint-Quentin.

Links to Paris from Cambrai (Gare du Nord) are mediocre if compared to those of the neighbouring cities. Valenciennes, Douai and Arras are connected to Paris by TGV several times per day. Saint-Quentin is connected by TER or Intercités trains with less than two hours travel time. Cambrai was connected to Paris in 2010 by a single direct Intercités service of two hours, with a little-suited schedule for professional use. The times of other trains via Douai or Saint-Quentin vary between two and four and a half hours.

====Railway history====


As early as 1833, the municipal council sought passage of a railway line through Cambrai. However, a route through Arras and Douai, to Lille, with a branch to Valenciennes, was preferred in 1845. It remained, therefore, to connect Cambrai to this line, which was done in 1878 by a single, winding line between Cambrai and Douai. Meanwhile, Cambrai had been linked, in 1858, to the Paris-Brussels line by a branch line from Busigny and joining Somain, near Douai.

Other railway lines of local interest saw development in the 19th century, particularly in 1880 the Société des Chemin de fer du Cambrésis which operated three routes in the Cambrésis between Cambrai, Caudry, Saint-Quentin, Le Cateau and Denain. An agricultural use of Cambrai to Marquion, now off line, was also open in 1898.

Cambrai railway station was also the terminus of a standard gauge secondary route of linking Marquion and Boisleux-au-Mont.
====Railway projects====
The regional transport scheme evokes three axes or projects concerning Cambrai: Improving the Douai-Cambrai connections, the construction of a new railway line between Cambrai and Marquion-Arras, in conjunction with the large gauge Seine-North Europe canal project and the establishment of a business zone of Marquion, as well as &quot;searching for a link from Orchies towards Cambrai&quot;.

===Waterways===
Cambrai is one of the seven territorial subdivisions of the regional management of Nord-Pas-de-Calais of navigable waterways in France. The city is located at the junction of the Saint-Quentin canal to the Oise and Paris and the Canal de l&#x27;Escaut, which leads to the Dunkerque-Escaut canal. 
A marina is located at the junction of the two canals, at Cambrai-Cantimpré.

The Canal de l&#x27;Escaut (Scheldt canal), between Cambrai and Valenciennes, was opened to navigation in 1780.

Moreover, a river link between Paris and the Nord department had been projected as early as the time of Mazarin and Colbert. The construction of the Saint-Quentin canal, between Chauny on the Oise and Cambrai, was taken up in 1802 on the order of Napoleon I and completed in 1810, after the drilling of the Riqueval Tunnel. The canal and tunnel were opened with great pomp on 28 April 1810 by the Emperor and Empress Marie-Louise. The Saint-Quentin canal has experienced heavy traffic, but since 1966, the date of the opening of the Canal du Nord, it has lost much of its importance.

====Waterways projects====

A wide-gauge river link project, called Seine-Escaut Link project is part of the 30 priority projects of the future trans-European transport network. The route of this project is through Marquion, west of Cambrai. A platform of activities is planned therein. The commissioning of the canal could take place around 2015.

===Airports===
Cambrai is in close proximity to two airfields: &quot;Cambrai-Epinoy&quot;, to the north-west, whose use was booked at the until its closure in 2012, and &quot;Cambrai Niergnies&quot;, to the southeast, opened to recreational aviation.

Within an approximate radius of 1 hr 30 mins by road are five major airports: Lille-Lesquin at , Brussels South Charleroi at , Brussels National at , Paris Beauvais-Tillé at and Paris Charles-de-Gaulle at .

===Urban transport===
By 1897, that is, upon completion of the demolition of the fortifications, the city had considered the construction of electric tram lines. It was a very modern solution for the time, since electric traction only appeared in 1881 and the development of this mode of transport didn&#x27;t truly occur until 1895 in Paris and the Paris region. In 1903, the network of the was opened, and with five lines. After World War I, the uneconomic network was not recommissioned.

Since 1933 the agglomeration of Cambrai has been served by a , five urban routes were operating in 2010, run by CFC (Railways of Cambrésis):

*A: Luxembourg – Cambrai stations – Escaudœuvres
*B: Neuville-Saint-Rémy – Cambrai stations – ZAC Cambrai-South
*C: Les Martigues-Pyrénées – Cambrai stations – Raillencourt-Sainte-Olle
*D: Cambrai stations – Raillencourt-Sainte-Olle
*E: ZAC Cambrai-South – Cambrai stations

Since 7 January 2013, the agglomeration community of Cambrai has implemented a free shuttle which serves seventeen stops around the city.

In 2008, the &quot;Urban Transport Perimeter&quot; (PTU) of Cambrai which, with 59,326 inhabitants, is the smallest of the twelve PTU of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region had completed about per year, corresponding to 740,000 journeys.

The agglomeration community of Cambrai is the organising authority of urban transport. However, while it has twenty-three communes, only six were served by urban transport in 2006. For other towns and cities, the urban community has delegated jurisdiction to the department.

In a relatively sparsely populated agglomeration with little extensive public transport, it cannot easily compete with the automobile. Nevertheless, the agglomeration community of Cambrai reflects on the future of urban transport from a perspective of sustainable development, with aims to strengthen the supply of public transport in order to capture a portion of travel by private car, and reducing car traffic and CO2 emissions. The realisation of the new multimodal transport hub in the quarter of the railway station of Cambrai is part of this policy.

==Urbanism==
===Urban morphology===

====Origins====
The old centre of Cambrai was established on a small rise overlooking, from the right bank, the marshy area of the Scheldt Valley. Indications suggest that a castrum was built at this location, although the scarcity of excavations at Cambrai in has provided no archaeological evidence. With its area of , the very modest castrum would&#x27;ve been much smaller than those of Boulogne at and Reims at , for example.

====Development====
Faubourgs were developed, at the time of the Merovingian prosperity, to the north and west of the primitive castrum, around the churches of Saint-Vaast and Saint-Aubert. The looting of the city by the Vikings in December 880 convinced the Bishop Dodilon to strengthen and expand fortifications: The new enclosure he built tripled the size of the city. To the southeast, on a hillock called Mont-des-Bœufs, Bishop Gaugericus had founded an abbey in 595, originally dedicated to Saint Médard and Saint Loup, then, after the death of the founder, Gaugericus himself. This abbey was certainly also protected by an enclosure. The space which separated these two urban cores hosted markets and fairs.


These two quarters were joined in the 11th century when Bishop Gérard I built the churches of Saint Nicolas and the Saint Sepulchre, southeast of the city and east of Mont-des-Bœufs. The town hall, the market, butcher and various bodies of craftsmen settled in this new urban space that Bishop Lietbert had protected by an earth rampart. Even today the &quot;Grand-place&quot;, the covered market, and a few names of streets (the &quot;Rue de Liniers&quot;, &quot;Rue des Rôtisseurs&quot;, &quot;Rue des Chaudronniers&quot; and &quot;Rue des Cordiers&quot;) recall this stage of urban development.

The Bishop Gérard II later replaced the earth rampart with a stone wall with towers, gates and ditches and encompassed the entire built space. Therefore Cambrai had reached the perimeter it would retain until the 19th century: While other cities in the region such as Bruges, Ghent or Douai expanded their enclosures until the 14th century, that of Cambrai was redesigned and reinforced, but without affecting the outline. The outline of this wall from the 11th century is still visible in the current boulevards.

It was probably under the episcopates of the bishops Gérard I, Liebert and Gérard II, in the 11th century, that was built the , a fortress located on the edge of the Scheldt to the northwest of the city. In the 13th century, the Bishop Nicolas III de Fontaines ordered work to put it &quot;on a good foot of defence&quot;. This castle, owned by the bishop-counts, was intended as much to monitor the city as to ensure the defence. Its military role ended in the 16th century, when Charles V grabbed the city and ordered the construction, on Mont-des-Bœufs northeast of the town, of a citadel for which 800 houses were demolished along with the Abbey of Saint Gaugericus. The Château de Selles was then used as a prison.

====Dismantling of fortifications====
In the 19th century, the city was cramped within its fortified walls, which limited its development and prohibited any urban planning.

The dismantling of the fortifications, requested by petition as early as 1862, was finally accepted by the State after a further 30 years. The work lasted 6 years and transformed the appearance of the city by the construction of a belt of wide boulevards, the sale of new land to build, connecting the city to its suburbs and the establishment of public gardens.

====Drainage work====
Cambrai is built on the edge of the wide marshy area of the Scheldt Valley encircling the western part of the city, the to the north at the gate of the Holy Sepulchre in the south: Wet gardens, ponds, meadows, ponds and marsh formed a flood zone sometimes also used for the defence of the city. The suburb of Cantimpré, linking the ancient heart to the Scheldt below to the west, had raised several metres. The two arms of the Scheldt (Escaut), the Escautins, are separated before entering the medieval town: The Escauette and the Clicotiau, which bathed the walls of the old urban core. These streams were probably due to man&#x27;s hand because they do not correspond to natural landforms. However, it is unknown whether their origin dates back to the Roman era or is from a later time.

Throughout the Middle Ages, and again in modern times, the Scheldt and its arms required constant work: Repair of levees, enhancement of pavement, straightening of the bed, as well as the digging of ditches to regulate the course of the river, prevent floods and ensure as far as possible a steady water level, on which the mills and tanneries depended. Despite these works, floods were frequent. The absorption of rainwater and household water descending from the upper areas of the city was also a problem. Bouly spoke in 1842, in his &quot;History of Cambrai and le Cambrésis&quot;, of &quot;fast torrents [stormwater] formed today by rolling up the Scheldt&quot;. In the Middle Ages the &quot;flow of el kayère&quot; (or &quot;flow of the chair&quot;), close to the current &quot;Grand-Place&quot;, was dug a reservoir for &quot;water courses of the falling waters of the sky&quot;, i.e. to control the flow of rainwater. In the 19th century aqueducts were built to carry these waters, and the streets were paved. Furthermore, in 1926 a drainage sewer was built at &quot;Rue Blériot&quot;.

The draining of the wetlands that surround the town began in 1804. The work ended in 1951 with the drying of the small stream of Saint Benoît near the Liberty Stadium, itself built on this wetland which dominated the ancient city walls, and in 1953 with the covering of the Clicotiau.

====The 20th century====

The destruction caused by World War I necessitated a reconstruction of the centre. The municipality organised a competition, which was won by . His project, inspired with both a regionalist taste and the Hausmannian style, completely redesigned the layout of roads from the Middle Ages. It was rebuilt as a modern city. The architect Louis Marie Cordonnier described the prospects to elected representatives:

The Leprince-Ringuet plan was only partially achieved, but the streets were removed, others expanded, and new paths were created as the &quot;Avenue de la Victoire&quot; [Avenue of Victory].

Further destruction due to the Allied bombing of April–August 1944 again required a reconstruction. It was especially, in the years following World War II, to rehouse the victims and to cope with the expanding population. Priority was given to detached houses, and new quarters appeared, such as the &quot;Martin–Martine&quot; subdivision south-east of the city. In the 1980s, the municipality worked to restore and develop the ancient heritage.

===Housing===
Cambrai had 18,112 housing units in 2017, of which 15,925 were occupied as primary residences. The proportion of individual housing is 54.2%. Primary residences dominate with 87.9%, and one can especially note the very low proportion of secondary residences in Cambrai: 1.0%.


The proportion of house owners, at 44.3%, is lower than in the rest of the country (57.5%). The tenants are much more numerous, 54.1% in Cambrai, against little more than 40% in France. Among rental housing, the proportion of HLM housing, at 16.7%, is significantly higher than the national average of 14.8%.

The age of the accommodation in Cambrai is distinguished from both regional and national averages. Housing is older, on average, in Cambrai than in the rest of the country. The proportion of (pre-1945) &quot;old&quot; housing, is 33.5%, which is significantly higher than the French average of 22.2%. Meanwhile, dwellings built between 1946 and 1970 account for 37.0% of the total in Cambrai, significantly above the 21.5% of the country. This proportion can probably be explained by the necessary reconstruction which followed the destruction of World War II, as well as programmes of Maison Familiale group homes in the 1960s and 1970s. More recent housing is relatively less in the city than in the rest of France or even in the region: 7.3% of accommodation in Cambrai was built between 1991 and 2005, compared with 16.1% in France; 5.2% have been built since 2006, compared with 10.9% in France. This is probably a consequence of the less dynamic economy and population of the city in recent years.

The agglomeration community seeks to improve the quality of the accommodation by various means: Encourage rehabilitation of vacant properties, expand available accommodation which is suitable for elderly or handicapped people, increase the supply of rentals and promote the construction of more energy-efficient housing. The creation of 960 new social houses was provided over six years, from 2008 to 2014.

The signed in 2007 with the city and the urban community was the first of the Nord department. Five quarters, not classified as &quot;sensitive urban areas&quot;, are concerned: The old centre where old habitat remains, the &quot;l&#x27;Amérique&quot; and &quot;La Forêt&quot; estates, consisting primarily of multi-family housing, and the &quot;d&#x27;Esnes&quot; and &quot;de Guise&quot; estates dominated by single-family housing.

===Development projects===
In 2010, the projects of the municipality include:

*The &quot;docks and warehouses,&quot; Brownfield site of at the edge of the Saint-Quentin canal, the assignment of which has not yet been determined but which should essentially be devoted to recreation.
*The rehabilitation of the centre of the Martin–Martine quarter, and in particular the transformation of the green corridor which was originally reserved for an &quot;urban expressway&quot;, never realised.
*The layout of the &quot;Place du 9-Octobre&quot; around the Church of Saint-Géry [Saint Gaugericus]
*The redevelopment of the station quarter in the &quot;exchange hub&quot;: A study on the development of the multimodal trade hub of Cambrai was launched in 2007 by the agglomeration community of Cambrai in partnership with the city, the Northern Department and the region, with purpose the station District redevelopment and improvement of intermodality.
*The relocation of the library to new premises.
*The &quot;modernisation&quot; of the public garden.

On the other hand, the revolves around eight themes: &quot;Cambrai, an urban centre in the countryside&quot;, &quot;Preserve and enhance the natural, rural and agricultural space&quot;, &quot;Reclaim and restructure&quot;, &quot;Render Cambrai fully in its &quot;urbanity&quot;&quot;, &quot;Build upon the city of history&quot;, &quot;Save and protect the environment, improve the quality of the living environment&quot;, &quot;Ensuring economic and sustainable development&quot;, and also &quot;Mastering travel or promoting changes in modes of transport&quot;.

==Toponymy==
The location is attested as &quot;Camaracum&quot; in the 4th century in the Peutinger Table and &quot;Cameracum&quot; (no date). It recognises the Gallo-Roman suffix of Celtic origin &quot;place of&quot;, &quot;property of&quot;, preceded by an element not identified with certainty. Albert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing offered the Gallo-Roman type name of a person called Camarus.

This is also found in the anthroponym of Chambray (Eure) (&quot;Cambracus&quot; 1011, &quot;Cameragus&quot; to 1025). Variants &quot;Cambarius&quot; and &quot;Camarius&quot; would also explain Cambayrac, Chambry in Aine and the same in Seine-et-Marne, Chamery, Chémery, etc. François de Beaurepaire notes that it may also be a pre-Latin &quot;camar&quot; or &quot;cambar&quot; theme. However, Xavier Delamarre cited the personal name &quot;Cambarius&quot;, which he considers as based on the Gallic word &quot;cambo-&quot; &quot;curve&quot; (cf. old Irish &quot;camb&quot;, &quot;camm&quot; &quot;curved&quot;, &quot;bent&quot; or &quot;twisted&quot;). &quot;Camarus&quot; would be a variant of this Gallic nickname meaning &quot;that which is curved&quot;.

The Cambrai shape is Normanno-Picard with a hard &quot;C&quot;, characteristic of the north of the Joret line and therefore corresponds to the form of Francien type Chambray. In addition, the name of the town was written &quot;Cambray&quot; until the French Revolution.

It is known under the name of &quot;Kamerijk&quot; in Dutch and formerly &quot;Kamerich&quot; in German and &quot;Camberick/Cambrick&quot; in English.

==Politics and administration==
===Political trends and results===
Overall, voting in Cambrai is little different from the national vote, but the abstention rate is often higher: For example, it was 34.86% in the 2005 referendum (against 30.63%); 22.07% in the first round of the 2007 presidential election (compared with 16.23%) and 38.13% in the first round of the legislative elections of 2002 (compared to 35.58%).

Cambresiens voters seem also more cautious with regard to the European Union and the French in general: The referendum on the ratification of the Treaty on European Union of 1992 was rejected by 53.35%, while at the national level it was approved by a narrow majority of 51.04%. In 2005, the draft law on the ratification of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was rejected more widely in Cambrai (59.8% of voted &quot;No&quot;) than at the national level (54.67%).

In the presidential election of 2007 the results of the second round were very close to national figures: 54.07% for Nicolas Sarkozy and 45.93% for Ségolène Royal, against respectively 53.06% and 46.94% at the national level. In the first round Jean-Marie Le Pen achieved a slightly better result at Cambrai (13.28%) than France (10.44%), while François Bayrou was in a reversed situation (16.77% against 18.57%). Arlette Laguiller (2.02%) and Olivier Besancenot (4.77%) were the only other candidates to exceed 1.5%. In the second round of the presidential election of 2002 Jacques Chirac arrived largely in the lead in Cambrai as in the rest of the country but Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s result was higher (21.11% against 17.79%).

In the legislative elections of 2007, François-Xavier Villain, the candidate related to the UMP and who was also the incumbent Mayor of Cambrai, achieved 57.42% in the first round (48.03% in the constituency). All the other candidates were below the national percentage of their party. For example, the Socialist Party achieved 22.91% against 24.73%, the Communist Party at 3.10% compared to 4.29% and the UDF at 6.21% against 7.61%. The decline of the National Front was also more marked in Cambrai (4.14%) than elsewhere (4.24%). One finds a situation close to the 2002 elections.

In the first round of the presidential election of 2012, the four candidates in the lead in Cambrai were Nicolas Sarkozy (UMP, 28.29%), François Hollande (PS, 27.56%), Marine Le Pen (FN, 20.81%) and Jean-Luc Mélenchon (Left Front, 10.14%) with a turnout of 72.61%. In the second round, François Hollande was in the lead with 50.75% of the vote, with a participation rate of 73.09%.

===Municipal government===
Cambrai is the chef-lieu of one of the six arrondissements in the Nord department. Cambrai is also the seat of the canton of Cambrai, which consists of 27 communes (including Cambrai).

Since 22 December 1992, Cambrai is the seat of the which includes 33 communes and approximately 68,000 inhabitants. The city also adheres to the following intercommunal structures:

*The Intercommunal Association of Sanitation of the Cambrai Agglomeration (SIAC).
* &quot;Scènes mitoyennes&quot; [&quot;Adjoining Stages&quot;], created in August 2000, brings together the communes of Cambrai, Caudry, Escaudœuvres and Neuville-Saint-Rémy with which it harmonises cultural policies.
*SIVU &quot;Murs mitoyens&quot; [&quot;Adjoining Walls&quot;], operational since 1 January 2006 and headquartered in Caudry, its mission is to educate the various planning authorities for the two cities.
*The Intercommunity Association of the energy of the Cambrésis (SIDEC), which is headquartered at Neuville-Saint-Rémy, brings together the 111 communes in the arrondissement. It concedes the management of the public service energy distribution to ERDF and manages the work of strengthening and concealment of networks.
*The (SCoT) of le Cambrésis (via the agglomeration community of Cambrai).
*The Joint Association for the Enhancement of the Upper Scheldt (via the agglomeration community of Cambrai).

Cambrai was merged with the commune of Morenchies in 1971.

===List of mayors===
Since 1945, Cambrai has had three mayors. The city, after having constantly re-elected a Socialist mayor from the Liberation until 1977 in the person of Raymond Gernez, has since been administered by mayors from RPR or the related UMP: Jacques Legendre until 1992, then François-Xavier Villain. The latter was elected to the 18th constituency in Nord on 16 June 2002 and re-elected in 2007 and 2012.
===Judicial and administrative authorities===
Cambrai was for a short time the seat of the Parlement of French Flanders, from 1709 until its transfer to Douai in 1713.

The city is now within the jurisdiction of the . It is the seat of a whose jurisdiction coincides with the boundaries of the arrondissement, a Tribunal d&#x27;instance and an industrial tribunal, installed in the restored . With the reform of the judicial map launched in 2007 the city has lost its commercial court and is linked to that of Douai.

===Environmental policy===
The environmental policy is one of the competences of the .

==Twin towns and sister cities==
Cambrai is twinned with:
* Pushkin, Saint Petersburg, Russia
* Châteauguay, Canada, since 1980
* Gravesham, United Kingdom, since 1989
* Esztergom, Hungary, since 1991
* Cieszyn, Poland

==Population==
===Demographics===
In 2018, the commune had 32,501 inhabitants. 
The urban unit (&quot;unité urbaine&quot;) of Cambrai had 46,772 inhabitants in 2018, and the urban area (&quot;aire urbaine&quot;) 94,576 inhabitants. In other less populated regions, Cambrai would be an important city, but in Nord-Pas-de-Calais, densely populated and urbanised, the city and its suburbs come far behind Lille (1,143,125 inhabitants), Douai-Lens (552,682), Valenciennes (399,677), Dunkirk (265,974) and Maubeuge (125,000).

The population of Cambrai increased little over the centuries: Estimated at 10,000 souls in the 15th century, it is, according to a memorandum of intendant who described it as &quot;very diminished&quot;, at 12,000 in 1698. At the end of the Revolution, in 1801, it was still only approximately 15,000 inhabitants.

It increased slowly but steadily throughout the 19th century with a net decline in the early 20th century: the birth rate, as everywhere else in France, declined. At the same time, infant mortality remained high (20.3% in 1900, 10.2% on the eve of the war), which explains the low natural growth.

The population growth resumed at a rapid pace between the end of World War II and the beginning of the 1970s (the Trente Glorieuses), through natural increase (baby boomers and sharp decline of infant mortality) and the rural exodus, which slowly emptied the villages of Cambrésis of their population (partial) towards the town of Cambrai. This dynamism, however, showed however signs of stalling since 1968: in fact, the progress of jobs (+27.5% from 1952 to 1975) did not follow that of the population (+44.2%).

The curve was brutally reversed by the 1973 oil crisis. The city&#x27;s population plummeted from the 1975 census, net migration which was largely positive in the 1960s became negative, while the natural balance, which remains positive, tends to shrink. Many traditional activities have disappeared (chocolate production, brewery, chicory, weaving, metallurgy, etc.), representing several thousand jobs.

====Age structure====
The graphics below represent the age structure in 2017 of the population of the commune of Cambrai, and of the Nord department. The population of Cambrai is relatively old, partly compensated by a higher representation of the age group 15–29 years.

====Population distribution====
The population distribution of Cambrai (active population aged 15 or more in employment) by showed an under-representation of managers and higher intellectual professionals (10.0%) with the French average (16.3%), in 2017, and vice versa slightly higher proportions of manual workers (28.3% compared with 21.5%) and employees (30.2% against 28.5%). The proportion of is lower (22.8% against 24.8%). The percentage of farmers is naturally low in Cambrai (0.2%).

The distribution of the population over the age of 15 years, and not enrolled in study, showed lower education rates than those of metropolitan France in 2017, most significantly in the higher levels (Baccalauréat or Bac+5 years of study).

==Education==
Cambrai is the seat of a pool of training divided into three districts (Cambrai-North, Cambrai-South and Cambrai-Le Cateau) and dependent on the of Nord and the Academy of Lille.

===Schools===
The city administers twelve , and eleven .

The department manages four : Jules-Ferry, Fénelon, Lamartine and Paul-Duez.

The Nord-Pas-de-Calais region operates four : Fénelon, Paul-Duez and the vocational Louise de Bettignies and Louis-Blériot. Cambrai also has a private institution, the ensemble of Saint-Luc, bringing together three former private schools merged in September 2009: Collège Jeanne d&#x27;Arc, Institution Notre Dame de Grace (college and high school of general and technological education) and the vocational high school La Sagresse.

===University life===
Cambrai hosts two branches of the University of Valenciennes and Hainaut-Cambresis (UVHC), and Lille-2.

UVHC antenna prepares eleven diplomas, which include of DUT, IUP, Master Pro, professional licenses (including &quot;Cultural Actions and Promotion of Heritage&quot; and &quot;Trades of Archaeology&quot;) and licenses.

The branch of Lille-2 prepares to obtain a license &quot;mention droit&quot; or &quot;mention economic and social administration&quot;, as well as three professional licenses: For management of small-medium businesses, for transportation of goods and for security professions.

Finally, Catholic teaching. The whole of Saint Luc de Cambrai was a centre of higher education (Sup&#x27;Sagesse) from Bac+1 to Bac+5: BTS optician, BTS insurance, NRC, MUC, AG and AM, two professional licenses (&quot;Operational Marketing Manager&quot; and &quot;Contingency Insurance and Management of Goods&quot;) and finally a Professional Master of &quot;Entrepreneurial Strategy and Management&quot;, opened to the entrepreneurs.

With nearly 500 students in alternation, learning or school track, Sup&#x27;Sagesse is a real city centre campus, incorporating a boarding school.

Other institutions of higher education in Cambrai are the and the Institute of Nursing Education.

Among the alumni of the École des Beaux-Arts of Cambrai are Marie-Anne and Ludovic Belleval who are now both the Lamour Mill&#x27;s owners and curators in Briastre.

==Health==
Medical density is quite good at Cambrai, when compared with the regional and national averages. In the agglomeration community there are 2.04 general practitioners per 1,000 inhabitants (Nord Pas-de-Calais region and metropolitan France 1.65), and 1.98 specialist doctors per 1,000 inhabitants (region: 1.39, metropolitan France: 1.74).

The Saint-Julien hospital, which housed the poor and the sick, was founded in 1070. Today it remains as a chapel adjoining the municipal theatre. Over the following centuries, other hospitals were founded: The Saint-Lazare Hospital for lepers, the Charité Hospital, Saint-Jean Hospital, the Saint Jacques au Bois Hospital to welcome the pilgrims, the general hospice of La Charité founded in 1752 to accommodate the elderly, beggars and the marginalised.

After World War II, the construction of a modern hospital was envisaged.

The Central Hospital of Cambrai has a capacity of 770 beds and 108 seats. It employs a staff of 150 officers and has a non-medical staff of 1,200. Three annex buildings are reserved for medium and long stay, maternity (1982) and Psychiatry (1983–1884) patients. A Nursing Training Institute was opened in 1967.

The work for the construction of the present site began in 1959, the installation of the patients being carried out between 1966 and 1968. In 2007, the work to modernise and expand the central hospital was undertaken.

The 2010 prize list of &quot;the safest hospitals&quot; places the Central Hospital of Cambrai as the 11th best in the national ranking.

Cambrai has three private clinics: The Sainte-Marie Clinic, Saint-Roch clinic and the Cambrésis Clinic.

==Economy==
Cambrai is the seat of the . In April 2007, it decided to merge with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Arras, a decision which was called into question on 4 October 2007, by the Ministry of Supervision of the Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

As a result of the planned closure in 2012 , Cambrai and Cambrésis are classified from 1 January 2010 and until 31 December 2012 in the free zone &quot;Zone of Defence Restructuring&quot;, allowing enterprises to create, settle or develop tax and social security exemptions.

===Economic history===
As early as the Middle Ages, Cambrai was both an agricultural market for its region, which produces mainly cereals and wool, and a centre of weaving (sheets, woad, cloth, linen, chiffon). This dual role would persist for a long time. The drapery declined at the end of the 13th century but it was replaced by batiste, a speciality of the city, which experienced its greatest trend in the 17th century. Production declined, in turn, in the following century, but in 1775 there were still 58,000 pieces of batiste marked to Cambrai.

Economic activity declined under the First Empire due to the wars and the British blockade. In the 19th century, the textile industry remained as the dominant activity of the city, with 2,546 workers, men, women and children, in 1848. Batiste made the bulk of Cambrai&#x27;s trade with other productions such as soap and refined sea salt. The food industry grew: Brasserie, chicory; the Bêtise de Cambrai was invented in 1850.

In the 19th century, the city was industrialised, especially when compared to its neighbours. Municipal officials often refused the installation of new factories, on behalf of sanitation or lack of space. The Sucrerie centrale de Cambrai was created in 1872, by Jules Linard on the territory of the town of Escaudœuvres. However, according to the census of 1886, industry was supporting more than 9,000 people, while agriculture used only 2,000 at most. The city mainly developed its commercial function: At the beginning of the 20th century the branch of the Bank of France from Cambrai ranked 12th in France, before Nice and Toulouse.

After the World War II reconstruction stimulated the building industry. New enterprises were created from 1950: Hosiery, mechanics and carpentry employed several thousand people, while traditional manufacturing was disappearing: Chicory, chocolate, brewery and weaving. The economic crisis, of the 1970s, seriously degraded the employment situation.

===Business and shops===
There are four zones and parks of activity in the agglomeration:
* The industrial zone of Cantimpré, to the south-west of the city.
* The Actipole Park, on the edge of the A2 autoroute west of Cambrai, offers a total area of . As it is completely occupied, it is being extended.
* The zone of Fontaine-Notre-Dame, a kilometre from the A26 autoroute, offers a total area of .
* The zone of South Cambrai Proville, one kilometre to the south of Cambrai, on the , in the direction of Saint-Quentin, is devoted to the commercial areas over an area of .

The economy of Cambrai is based on four pillars:
* Agriculture, which occupies a third of the territory of the commune.
* The agri-food industry, which occupies an important place in the economy of the commune (confectionery, candy, dairy, etc.) due to strong agricultural activity (intensive farming of livestock and cereals) in the arrondissement (80% of the area).
* Logistics, benefitting from the situation of the commune of Cambrai in the heart of the triangle London–Paris–Benelux and the intersection of two motorways, tends to be concentrated in the western part of the agglomeration. Thus all of the of the Actipôle Raillencourt zone of activity located west of Cambrai on the edge of the A2 autoroute are now used, partly by distribution undertakings, for a thousand jobs around. The extensions Actipole 2 and 3 are underway or study.
* Textile, found predominantly in the rest of the arrondissement (Caudry, Villers-Outréaux, etc.) is represented in Cambrai by clothing and linens. The Cambrai region is associated with those of Calais and the Métropole Européenne de Lille within the Up-Tex competitiveness cluster, specialised in textile products high performance and customisation.

The Central Hospital of Cambrai, the commune of Cambrai, Auchan, Les Papillons blancs, Cora, TANIS (chemistry, rubber, plastic), the &quot;Compagnie des Engrenages et Réducteurs Messiaen Durand&quot; (mechanical equipment) and the departmental fire and rescue service were, in order, the eight major employers in the town, in 2008.

===Perspectives===
The future Seine-Scheldt link, the commissioning of which is scheduled for 2016, is today one of the most promising elements of economic development to the city and the area of Cambrai. The multimodal platform of activities of Marquion, west of Cambrai and on , should be employed to host European logistics and distribution centres and agro-food industries.

===Income of the population and taxation===

In 2009, the median was €15,302, which ranks Cambrai at 25,917th place among the 31,604 communes with more than 50 households in metropolitan France.

In 2008, 263 Cambrai tax households performed the solidarity tax on wealth, for a mean wealth of €1.665 million and an average tax amount of €5,017.

===Employment===
According to the results of the 2017 Census, the economically active population aged 15 and over of the commune included 14,454 people, 24.3% were unemployed (France: 13.9%).

The distribution of jobs by sector of activity shows the predominant weight (almost 90%) of the tertiary sector. This distribution reflects the role which the administrative and commercial centre plays in the commune for the surrounding countryside.

The distribution of jobs by socio-professional categories shows under-representation of &quot;executives and intellectual professions&quot;, and &quot;farmers&quot;, as well as an over-representation of the &quot;intermediary professions&quot; and &quot;employees&quot;.

The journeys to work are mostly by car (75.9%, France 70.5%) and one can note the low weight of public transport (5.8% against an average of 15.1% in France).

==Culture and heritage==

===Cultural events and festivities===
On 15 August is the communal festival of Cambrai, and one of the highlights of the popular local life. This great festival (or ) extends for ten days in the &quot;Place de l&#x27;Hôtel de ville&quot; [City Hall Square]. The day of 15 August is punctuated by the traditional parade of the giants , symbols of the city, and a fireworks display. This festival, originally a procession which took place the day after Trinity Sunday, dates back to 1220. It was embellished over time with fireworks, banquets and cavalcades, and was regarded as one of the seven wonders of the Cambrésis. Over the centuries the festival has changed, reflecting the concerns of the contemporary: Since attachment to France it has been celebrated on 15 August, festival of the Assumption, in response to the wish of Louis XIII to devote the Kingdom to the Virgin; in 1790 it celebrated the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Fête de la Fédération; in 1802, with the signature of the concordat, the image of Our Lady of Grace was again carried in procession, reinforced by the bust of Fénelon. Under the First Empire it celebrated his Imperial Majesty Napoleon I. In the 19th century, finally, interests turned more to local life, and the progress of science and industry.

Musically, the town of Cambrai receives two festivals. Firstly, the &quot;Juventus&quot; classical music festival. The Juventus association mark young talented European soloists. They are appointed, if they accept it, &quot;Juventus Winners&quot; during their first participation in a Juventus festival. Every summer the old and the new winners gather for a fortnight at the festival to prepare chamber music concerts in exceptional conditions. &quot;Juventus&quot;, established in 1991 at the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans, was set at Cambrai from 1998 with the help of the General Council of the department. Meanwhile, is an alternative music festival, which has been organised since 2003.

=== French sartorial heritage ===
The city was a pivotal center of mulquinerie.

===Sites and monuments===

A large part of the monumental heritage of Cambrai has disappeared over the centuries. It was firstly Charles V, in order to build a citadel at the Mont-des-Bœufs, who ordered the destruction of the Abbey Saint-Gery of Gothic style in 1543.

During the French Revolution all of the religious buildings of the town were sold as national property and destroyed, including the old cathedral. Only four churches, a converted attic, a hospital, a temple of reason and a prison, were spared.

The dismantling of the fortifications, from 1894, led to the disappearance of many gates. Some have been preserved thanks to the interventions of the Society of Emulation of the city.

World War I was again responsible for significant destruction, the German army having undermined and torched the city centre before retreating in September 1918. A total of 1,214 buildings were destroyed, including the city hall, which was rebuilt in the neoclassical style before the Revolution by the architects Jacques Denis Antoine and Nicolas-Henri Jardin.

Finally at the end of World War II, in April 1944, and then again in May, July and until 11 August, Cambrai suffered Allied bombardments. A total of 55% of the buildings were heavily damaged and 13% were completely destroyed.

Despite this considerable destruction, the city kept an important monumental heritage. Cambrai has been classified as a City of Art and History since 1992, the first town of the Nord department to obtain this prestigious label.

====Religious heritage====
The Our Lady of Grace Cathedral was completed in 1703, in the classical style of the time, as the abbey church of the Holy Sepulchre. The church survived the turbulence of the French Revolution as a Temple of Reason from 1794. The admirable Gothic Cathedral from the 12th century was destroyed in the aftermath the Revolution of 1789. There is no trace on the present &quot;Place Fénelon&quot; of the former building. Bishop Louis Belmas adopted the former abbey church as the new cathedral in 1801.

The apse contains the monumental tomb of Fénelon, a masterpiece of the sculptor David d&#x27;Angers, and the semitransepts with &quot;l&#x27;Icône Notre Dame de Grâce&quot; [the Icon of Our Lady of Grace] and the nine reputed grisailles by Geeraerts of Antwerp. The grand organs were built by the house of of Ixelles in 1897. After the events of World War I, extensive restoration was undertaken by the organ builder Auguste Convers, who brought the current instrument to 49 stops with 3,670 pipes. The building was classified in the inventory of Historic Monuments on 9 August 1906.

The most commonly called the College of the Jesuits&#x27; Chapel, completed in 1692, is a unique example of Baroque art in France, to the north of Paris. The chapel served as a prison to the nearby Revolutionary Court in 1794, and it was classified in the inventory of Historic Monuments on 30 April 1920.

The , a listed historical monument since 26 November 1919, is one of the oldest monuments of Cambrai. It contains a remarkable choir screen in polychromatic marble carved by the Cambrai native Gaspard Marsy as well as &quot;La mise au tombeauu&quot; by Peter Paul Rubens dating from 1616. The grand organs built in 1867 by Merklin were the subject of a significant transformation in 1978. The current instrument has 41 stops. This church has been the subject of a restoration of the frontage and roofing over a period of four years (2011–2015).

Other buildings of Cambrai are also classified or listed as Historic Monuments. The former has been registered since 2 March 1943, and the have been classified as Historic Monuments since 1949.

====Military heritage====
The Citadel: Despite its dismantling in the 19th century, the Citadel of Charles V retained the counter-mine galleries which are today buried; the Royal gate and drawbridge, classified in the inventory of historical monuments on 14 April 1932, flanked on the back of two guardhouses and an arsenal of the 16th century. Among subsequent developments, a powder magazine, housing for officers and a &quot;bombproof&quot; barracks of the 19th century are also noteworthy.

The is an old fortified château, which was built in the 11th century. Once isolated by the waters of the Scheldt, it has retained its towers and walls and especially buried ducts. The ducts include much graffiti which attests to the desperation of the prisoners, confined on the orders of the Count-Bishop.

The (late 14th century), (17th century) and the (or Saint-Fiacre), the Caudron (1st half of the 15th century) and (16th century) are the remains of the medieval walls.

====Civil heritage====
The , formerly the bell tower of the Church of Saint-Martin. The monument, built in the 15th century, became a belfry of Cambrai in 1550. Classified in the inventory of historical monuments on 15 July 1965, in 2005 the belfry was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France site, in recognition of its architecture and importance to the history of municipal power in Europe.

The city hall, renovated in 1932, opens onto the &quot;Grand&#x27;Place&quot; by a majestic Greek-style façade, surmounted by a bell tower where two bronze bell ringers, giant and Moorish type, strike the hours on a big bell above the big clock: , the protectors of the city. The marriage hall contains a series of frescoes and can be visited on request.

The Hotel de Francqueville (18th century) houses the rich collections of the , considerably enlarged and renovated in 1994. The relief map of the city, as it was at the end of the 17th century, is the starting point for essential guided tours of the city.

The &quot;Maison Espagnole&quot; [Spanish House], headquarters of the Tourist Office, dates from 1595 and is the last house which is half-timbered and gabled on regional-style street. Oak sculptures (chimeras and caryatids) which adorned its façade in the 19th century are exposed on the first floor inside after undergoing a serious restoration. One can visit its medieval cellars. This building has been classified in the inventory of historical monuments on 31 August 1920.

The covered market, built after World War II, is home to lively Les Halles market days.

The subterranean space which extends below the centre of the city, as in other medieval cities, was explored in the middle of the 19th century as well as to the end of the 20th century. Carved into the white chalk, it includes galleries and Romanesque and Gothic vaulted rooms. There are also wells and niches for statues. These excavations have served as quarries for the extraction of construction materials, as well as stone for lime: The [underground quarries] are inverted funnels about deep and wide at the base. This underground space was also used, until 1944, for shelters and caches during sieges, invasion or bombing. Their dating is uncertain: It is not impossible that some of these excavations were carved during the Roman era, but it is likely that they were spaced out over a long period, according to the needs. Tours are organised by the tourist office.

====Memorial heritage====
The German military cemetery of the &quot;Route de Solesmes&quot; and Cambrai East Military Cemetery: The cemetery and the &quot;Route de Solesmes&quot; was created by the German army in March 1917. Occupied since 1914, Cambrai was an important centre of command, logistics and health for the occupant. The cemetery was opened to accommodate the bodies of soldiers who died in hospitals in the city, including at the end of the Battle of Arras (April–May 1917) and the Battle of Cambrai (November–December 1917). The cemetery currently has 10,685 German graves, as well as those of 192 Russian prisoners of war and six Romanians. Two spaces, forming the Cambrai East Military Cemetery, contain the graves of 501 soldiers of the British Imperial Army.

===Environmental heritage===
Cambrai has the label &quot;Floral City&quot; with three flowers awarded by the &quot;National Council of Floral Cities and Villages of France&quot; in the Floral Competition of Cities and Villages.

The current public garden dates from the 19th century, which saw the creation of green spaces in the middle to encourage hygienics and which were liberated in addition to the areas occupied by the fortifications. This garden, divided into three distinct but contiguous parts, is located on the site of the old fortifications that surrounded the citadel built under Charles V:

*The &quot;flower garden&quot;, designed by the landscape architect Jean-Pierre Barillet-Deschamps, was established between 1852 and 1865 on . This garden was originally the only one planned but, at the insistence of the prefect of the time, it was increased to in 1864.
*The &quot;Monstrelet Garden&quot; designed &quot;in English&quot;, was soon added to the previous. It is so called because it houses a statue of Enguerrand de Monstrelet, chronicler of the Middle Ages who was the Provost of Cambrai. In 1876, the bandstand was erected, built on the plans of André de Baralle.
*The &quot;garden of caves&quot;, built in the early 19th century, carries a total area of more than . The &quot;caves&quot;, decorated with a waterfall, were the main attraction and gave their name to this part of the garden. They were completed in 1906 and in 2010 are awaiting rehabilitation.

These gardens, and in particular their statues, were damaged by the two world wars. In 1972, a modern hall, named as the &quot;Palais des Grottes&quot; [Mansion of Caves] and hosting exhibitions, trade fairs and concerts, was built in the middle of the garden of the same name.

A few other squares or gardens complement the green spaces of Cambrai: Fenelon Square, established in 1861 to the designs of Barillet-Deschamps on the site of the ancient metropolis and decorated in 1864 with a water fountain, that of the &quot;Place Marcelin Berthelot&quot;, which dates from 1911. This is at the foot of the walls of the Château de Selles, dating from the same year. The one of the Arquets tower dates from 1954. The avenues and boulevards planted with trees and flowers to complete make Cambrai a &quot;green&quot; city.

===Cultural heritage===
The Musée des Beaux-Arts de Cambrai opened in 1847 to present revolutionary seizures, has been installed since 1893 in a mansion of the 18th century, the Hotel de Francqueville. Renovated in 1994, it has three departments (archaeology, fine arts and heritage of Cambrai) on of which the most important is that of art. It presents Flemish and Dutch paintings from the 17th century and French artists of the 19th and 20th century. A recent donation also allowed it to present a collection of geometric abstractions of the second half of the 20th century.

The Diocesan Museum of Sacred Art still officially retains its label &quot;Musée de France&quot;, although it was closed to the public in 1975. This private museum is managed by the diocese, which is looking for ways to reopen the collections to the public. The items of this collection may be the subject of loans for temporary exhibitions and include objects from the archaeological excavations of the city of Cambrai, architectural elements, sculpture, paintings, pieces of jewellery and liturgical ornaments. This museum&#x27;s history began in 1926 when Monseignor , Archbishop of Cambrai, established a commission of religious history and sacred art aimed to inventory and preserve the archives and movable heritage of the diocese. Canon Cyrille Thelliez became secretary. In 1958, many religious objects from the diocese were gathered together and Thelliez founded the Diocesan Museum, the first religious art museum opened in France. The museum was installed in the former chapel of the Grand Seminary.

The Théâtre de Cambrai was built in 1924 by the architect , on the site of a chapel of the 16th century which was destroyed during World War I. The chapel had been abandoned for 25 years when its rehabilitation was undertaken in 1999. The renovated theatre was inaugurated in 2003. It is an Italian theatre of 700 seats which hosts various performances, including those of the &quot;Scènes mitoyennes&quot; [Adjoining Stages] association and the .

The &quot;Palais des grottes&quot; [Mansion of Caves] situated in the public garden, is a large multi-purpose hall with a capacity of 1,500 people and which can accommodate concerts, (including the ), fairs or exhibitions. Its remarkable roof shape, formed of a hyperbolic paraboloid (or &quot;saddle&quot;), was built in 1974 by then-advanced techniques and demonstrates a concrete form of architecture in the 20th century.

The media library is a classified municipal library: It has an important old fonds, with 956 manuscripts, the oldest dating back to the 7th century, from the confiscations made during the revolutionary era to religious communities, very important in the city, and emigrants of the region. This fonds was subsequently enriched by gifts, bequests and purchases. In 1975, it was one of the first institutions to adopt the title of &quot;media library&quot;. It is divided into four services: Youth, adults, library and local history and old books.

Cambrai has a national school of music and dramatic arts which obtained the &quot;Conservatoire à rayonnement départemental&quot; label in 2007.

===Culinary specialities===
The two best-known gastronomic specialties of Cambrai are the , a sausage traditionally made of ground veal (which was prohibited by European regulations, following the episode of mad cow disease, until 2015), which associated gastronomic society is one of the most representative in the region, and the Bêtise de Cambrai, a coated mint confection which is one of the most emblematic gourmet specialties of France.

The gastronomy of Cambrai also accounts for other less known specialities: Tripe, liver pâté with plums, hare with grapes, hochepot of partridge with puréed lentils, but also the , fromage blanc with fine herbs, and also a cheese trademarked as , or even crackers and &quot;pain crotté&quot; [muddy bread] (a type of French toast).

===Heraldry, motto===


The motto of the city has changed several times:

*1579: &quot;Cambray, city of peace.&quot;
*1580: &quot;Concordia parvæ res crescunt&quot; (&quot;Harmony makes small things grow&quot;). This motto is the same as that of the United Provinces (&quot;Unity makes strength&quot;)
*Current motto: &quot;Proud of its past, sure of its future.&quot;

The logo of the city is a stylisation of the steeples of the cathedral, the Saint-Géry Church and , a visual signature of the city, visible from afar. Locally, Cambrai is known as &quot;the city of three spires&quot;.

===Military life===
In 1711–1712, during the War of the Spanish Succession, the regiments of and Royal-Comtois had their barracks at Cambrai.

From the late 19th century, two military units were stationed at Cambrai. The 1st Infantry Regiment was quartered at Cambrai from 1870 to 1914, when it left for Belgium, before returning in 1919. It was split between the citadel and the Renel barracks. In 1940 it was again sent to Belgium, before being dissolved in 1942 in the free zone and did not return to Cambrai. The arrived in Cambrai in 1889 and is the Mortier quarter. This regiment was dissolved at the end of World War I. After World War II the Mortier quarter was assigned to the Selection Centre No. 2, today disbanded.

Until 2012, the &quot;René Mouchotte&quot; was near the city, founded in 1953 and which hosted the 01.012 Fighter Squadron &quot;Cambrésis&quot; created in 1952, the 02.012 &quot;Picardy&quot; and the 03.012 &quot;Cornouailles&quot; [Cornwall], as well as a ground-to-air defence squadron.

===Cambrai in literature and cinema===
*Ernst Jünger in &quot;Storm of Steel&quot;, dedicated to World War I, described Cambrai in 1917:

*The streets of Cambrai served as a backdrop to &quot;Sang noir&quot; [Black Blood], a 90-minute fiction filmed from 7 March to 6 April 2006 through Production of France 3 Lille, based on the novel of the same name by Louis Guilloux which takes place in 1917 in a small town, far from the Western Front.
*In 2007, the construction of the bypass of Cambrai was used for the filming of the movie &quot;In the Beginning&quot; by Xavier Giannoli. Some scenes of the film &quot;Présumé coupable&quot; [Presumed Guilty], by Vincent Garenq, were shot at Cambrai in April 2010.

<doc id="100061" wikidata="Q536138" url="?curid=100061" title="Wario">
<text>is a character in Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mario&quot; franchise that was designed as an archnemesis to Mario. Wario first appeared as the main antagonist and final boss in the 1992 Game Boy game &quot;Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins&quot;. His name is a portmanteau of the name Mario and the Japanese word &quot;warui&quot; (), meaning &quot;bad&quot;. He is usually portrayed as a selfish and greedy treasure hunter who, in karmic irony, routinely loses his spoils by adventure’s end. Since his debut, he has appeared in the majority of &quot;Mario&quot; video games. Hiroji Kiyotake designed Wario, and Charles Martinet voiced the character from 1993 to 2023.

Wario is also the main protagonist and antihero of the &quot;Wario Land&quot; platformer series and the &quot;WarioWare&quot; party game series. He makes regular appearances as a playable character in &quot;Mario&quot; spin-offs and other video game series, including &quot;Mario Sports&quot; games, &quot;Mario Kart&quot;, &quot;Mario Party&quot;, in which he is typically paired with the character Waluigi to form a comedy duo that rivals the partnership of Mario and his brother, Luigi. Wario has also been featured in several entries of the fighting game series &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;.

==Concept and creation==
The character Foreman Spike, a possible inspiration for Wario, first appeared in the 1985 game &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot;. Spike is a construction foreman who bears a slight resemblance to Wario. Game artist Hiroji Kiyotake designed Foreman Spike, whom Kiyotake imagined as &quot;the Bluto to Mario&#x27;s Popeye&quot;. Wario&#x27;s first named appearance occurred in the 1992 game &quot;Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins&quot;. Wario&#x27;s design arose from &quot;Super Mario Land&quot;″s design team&#x27;s distaste for making a game based around someone else&#x27;s character. The creation of Wario allowed them their own character to &quot;symbolize their situation&quot;. 

Wario is portrayed as a caricature of Mario: he has a large head and chin; huge muscular arms; a wide, short, slightly obese body; short legs; a large, pointier, zig-zagging mustache; and a bellicose cackle. He wears a plumber outfit with a yellow-and-purple color scheme, which is a short-sleeved yellow shirt, purple overalls, and a blue &quot;W&quot; on his hat. He also wears green shoes and white gloves with blue &quot;W&quot; symbols. In his early appearances, Wario wears a yellow, long-sleeved shirt and fuchsia overalls. The name &quot;Wario&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;Mario&quot; and the Japanese adjective , meaning &quot;bad&quot;, hence &quot;bad Mario&quot;, which is also symbolized by the &quot;W&quot; on his hat (an upside-down &quot;M&quot;). Waluigi was created to be the tennis partner of Wario in &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; and early material from Nintendo of Europe portrayed them as brothers, but their relationship has since been ambiguous. When asked whether Wario was a brother to Waluigi in 2008, voice actor Charles Martinet stated that while he did not know, he felt that they were just &quot;two nice, evil guys who found each other&quot;.

Nintendo originally considered making Wario a German character before he developed into an Italian like Mario. Wario was intended to be German at one point; German translator Thomas Spindler gave him German lines when he was brought on to voice Wario. This part of Wario was eventually dropped; Martinet&#x27;s Wario voice did not have any German influence. During his audition for the part, Martinet was told to speak in a mean-and gruff-sounding tone; he said voicing Wario is a looser task than voicing Mario, whose speaking manner and personality are freer-flowing, rising from the ground and floating into the air, while jealousy is one of Wario&#x27;s characteristics.

Wario is often portrayed as a villain in video games in which he makes a cameo appearance. The development team for &quot;Wario Land: Shake It!&quot; stated he was not really a villain, and they did not consider him one during development. They focused on his behavior, which alternates between good and evil. Etsunobu Ebisu and Takahiro Harada, producers of &quot;Shake It!&quot;, considered Wario to be a reckless character who uses his strength to overwhelm others. Tadanori Tsukawaki, &quot;Shake It!&quot; design director, described Wario as manly and said he was &quot;so uncool that he ends up being extremely cool.&quot; Because of this, Tsukawaki wanted Wario to act macho rather than silly and asked the art designers to emphasize his masculinity. During an interview with Kikizo, video game designer Yoshio Sakamoto, who was a member of R&amp;D1 since its early days, stated the project centered around Wario because the team &quot;couldn&#x27;t think of anyone else best for the role&quot;, and he was then described as &quot;unintelligent&quot; and &quot;always idiotic&quot;, which is the reason he was chosen as the star of the &quot;WarioWare&quot; series. According to an early 1990s Nintendo guide, Wario was Mario&#x27;s childhood friend, which &quot;Kotaku&quot; later contested in a parody article. Afterward, it was stated that they were not related to each other and were considered childhood rivals.

In his earliest appearances in &quot;Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins&quot; and &quot;Wario&#x27;s Woods&quot;, Wario displays considerable magical power, using spells on the population of islands to turn them into his minions, create duplicates, and grow very large. These traits were discontinued starting with &quot;Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3&quot;, in which he is rejuvenated by garlic in a similar manner to Mario being powered by mushrooms. In the &quot;WarioWare&quot; series, he became as a smelly slob, while in &quot;Mario Strikers: Battle League&quot;, his super shot special involves smashing his butt into the ball, followed by him devouring a giant clove of garlic. In &quot;&quot;, consuming garlic transforms Wario into &quot;Wario-Man&quot;, a superhero with powers relating to garlic-induced flatulence and bad breath. In other games, he uses farts as his special attack. Wario prominently uses bombs as tools and weapons in the &quot;WarioWare&quot; series as a visual motif to represent the time limit of a microgame.

==Appearances==

===&quot;Wario Land&quot; series===

Wario first appeared as a villain in the 1992 Game Boy video game &quot;Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins&quot;, in which he captures Mario&#x27;s castle. Tatanga, the villain of the first &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; game, is a henchman of Wario in the second, implying Wario is responsible for the events of both games. Wario also serves as a villain in the 1993 Japan-only puzzle game &quot;Mario &amp; Wario&quot;, in which Wario drops a bucket on the heads of Mario, Princess Peach, or Yoshi. This was followed by the first game in the &quot;Wario Land&quot; series, &quot;Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3&quot; (1994), a platform game that marks Wario&#x27;s first appearance as a protagonist and introduced his first villains, Captain Syrup and her Brown Sugar Pirates. In his next appearance in &quot;Virtual Boy Wario Land&quot; (1995), Wario plays similarly and has the ability to move in and out of the background. A sequel to the Game Boy game &quot;Wario Land II&quot; (1998) features Captain Syrup&#x27;s return as the antagonist. This game introduces Wario&#x27;s invulnerability, allowing him to be burned or flattened without sustaining damage.

In 2000, &quot;Wario Land 3&quot; was released for the Game Boy Color; it is another sequel that uses the same mechanics and concepts as its predecessor. The following year, the sequel &quot;Wario Land 4&quot; (2001) debuted on the Game Boy Advance and incorporates Wario&#x27;s ability to become burned or flattened and reintroduces the ability to become damaged from standard attacks. In 2003, &quot;Wario World&quot;, the first console &quot;Wario&quot; platform game, was released for the GameCube. It has three-dimensional graphics and gameplay and does not incorporate major elements from previous platform games. &quot;&quot; (2007) for the Nintendo DS introduces touch-screen control of Wario and incorporates puzzles into the gameplay. The series&#x27; most recent release, &quot;Wario Land: Shake It!&quot; (2008) for the Wii, reintroduces Captain Syrup. The game uses a hand-drawn animation style; Wario&#x27;s design required more than 2,000 frames of animation.

===&quot;WarioWare&quot; series===
In 2003, the &quot;Wario&quot; franchise introduced a new series of games, the first of which was &quot;WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!&quot; for the Game Boy Advance. The game&#x27;s premise involved Wario&#x27;s decision to open a game development company to make money, creating short &quot;microgames&quot; instead of full-fledged games. The game&#x27;s gameplay focused on playing a collection of microgames in quick succession. &quot;Mega Microgames!&quot; was later remade as &quot;WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Party Games!&quot; (2003) for the GameCube; it featured the same microgames but lacked a story mode and focused more on multi-player. In 2004, two sequels were released for the game. The first was the Game Boy Advance game &quot;&quot;, which used the cartridge&#x27;s tilt sensor to allow microgames to be controlled by tilting the handheld left and right. The second was the Nintendo DS release &quot;WarioWare: Touched!&quot;, which incorporates the DS&#x27;s touch screen and microphone into its gameplay. 

One of the Wii&#x27;s launch games in 2006 was &quot;&quot;, which used the Wii Remote&#x27;s motion-sensing technologies in a variety of ways. The Nintendo DS and Nintendo DSi have offered two new releases: 2008&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, which can be downloaded with the DSiWare service and uses the DSi&#x27;s built-in front camera in its gameplay, and 2009&#x27;s &quot;WarioWare D.I.Y.&quot;, which allows players to create microgames. &quot;Game &amp; Wario&quot; for the Nintendo Wii U was released on June 23, 2013. Although it does not use the &quot;WarioWare&quot; name, it incorporates gameplay and characters from the &quot;WarioWare&quot; series. The game also pays tribute to the original &quot;Game &amp; Watch&quot; games. In 2018, the Nintendo 3DS game &quot;WarioWare Gold&quot; was released, featuring 316 microgames and combining elements from &quot;Twisted&quot; and &quot;Touched&quot;. He also appeared in the 2021 Nintendo Switch game &quot;&quot; and the 2023 Nintendo Switch game &quot;&quot;, with 223 microgames.

===Other video games===
In &quot;Wario&#x27;s Woods&quot; (1994), Wario is the main antagonist who wants to take over the forest and is defeated by Toad. The same year, Wario appeared in the video game &quot;Wario Blast: Featuring Bomberman!&quot; (1994), a remake of a Bomberman game for the Game Boy that includes Wario as a playable character. Wario is a playable character in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series, starting with &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; (1992). Wario has appeared in &quot;Mario&quot; sports games, including &quot;Mario Golf&quot;, &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;, &quot;Mario Baseball&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Strikers&quot;, and the &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic&quot; series. Wario has also appeared in all installments of the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series, except &quot;Mario Party Advance&quot; (2005).

Wario is a playable character in two platform games for the Nintendo DS: the remake &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; (2004) and &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island DS&quot; (2006) as an infant version of himself, and the puzzle game &quot;Dr. Mario 64&quot; (2001). He is also a playable character in the fighting game series &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; and has appeared in every game since being introduced in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; (2008). He then reappears in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot; (2014) and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; (2018). Wario&#x27;s cameos include in &quot;Mario&#x27;s Super Picross&quot; (1995), &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; (1996), &quot;Densetsu no Stafy 3&quot; (2004), and &quot;Dr. Mario World&quot; (2019).

===Other media===
The 1992 graphic novel &quot;Super Mario Adventures&quot;, which is a collection of comics originally serialized in the video-gaming magazine &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, features Wario in two of the stories, one of which focuses on Wario&#x27;s past and explains his rivalry with Mario.

Wario appears in &quot;South Park&quot;″s &quot;Imaginationland Episode III&quot; (2007) as one of the characters from the &quot;dark side&quot; of Imaginationland. In 2010, Charles Martinet&#x27;s Wario voice was used in an advertisement promoting &quot;WarioWare D.I.Y.&quot; for British supermarket chain Tesco. In a May 2021 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, host Elon Musk starred as Wario in a sketch in which he was put on trial for murdering Mario in a kart race. In February 2024, Homer Simpson portrayed Wario in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Lisa Gets an F1&quot;. Wario has also received several of his own Amiibo, which can be used in a wide array of games, including his own.

Jack Black stated his interest in a potential sequel to &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; in which Pedro Pascal, who played Mario in a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch, would voice Wario as the film&#x27;s main villain.

==Reception==
Since his appearance in &quot;Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3&quot;, Wario has received a largely positive reception and has become a well-established mascot for Nintendo. Several gaming publications described Wario as one of the best video game villains. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; found the levity of Wario games &quot;liberating&quot; compared to big Nintendo franchises such as &quot;Mario&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. The writer could &quot;empathise more with the hopelessly materialistic Wario than goody brown-shoes Mario. Deep down, we&#x27;d all rather chase pounds over princesses.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; editor Travis Fahs said that while Wario is not the most likeable character, his strong confidence overshadows his flaws and makes him entertaining. Audrey Drake of &quot;IGN&quot; said of Wario, &quot;[A]ll this weird dude seems to care about is amassing as many material possessions and shiny things as possible&quot;, KhalidEternalNigh of &quot;Destructoid&quot; praised the character, describing him as &quot;fat, lazy, greedy, and a cheater&quot; and said: &quot;[D]espite all of this I can&#x27;t help but love him. Wario is, in my humble opinion, the most perfect &#x27;evil twin&#x27; in the history of video games. [...] During Wario&#x27;s career he has worn many hats – a game designer, a biker, a treasure hunter, and a hat that spits fire for some reason. Yet no matter what he does, no matter how mean he is, somehow Wario manages to charm his way into our hearts while picking our pockets.&quot; Ryan Gilliam of &quot;Polygon&quot; described Wario as the &quot;ultimate Italian American&quot; and said the character &quot;captures so much more of the Italian personality that resonates with me.&quot; He also said, &quot;Wario trumps Mario as my family mascot, born with a crucial, relatable need to be louder and larger than life.&quot; According to Mike Sholars of &quot;Kotaku&quot;, &quot;Wario Isn&#x27;t Evil, He&#x27;s Honest&quot;. Sholars concluded, &quot;Wario was conceived out of a desire to put a twist on the familiar, but his creators tapped into a powerful, universal constant: The Unrepentant Asshole.&quot; Edwin Evans of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; praised Wario for being &quot;repulsive&quot; and &quot;brilliant&quot; and said, &quot;In general, Wario isn&#x27;t the star he used to be, [...] [b]ut he remains a crucial component of the Nintendo pantheon, the counterbalancing touch of malevolence and cunning without which Mario&#x27;s star wouldn&#x27;t shine quite so brightly.&quot; William Hughes of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; described him as &quot;Nintendo&#x27;s stinky, cheating genius&quot; and said the character &quot;captures the split at the heart of Nintendo. [...] All we know if that Wario would have loved the possibilities the smash hit console presents, and that the absence of a new &quot;WarioWare&quot; game on the handheld remains a real shame to the legacy of all the things—good, bad, flatulent, weird, and more—that he means to the company&quot;, while Cass Marshall of &quot;Polygon&quot; said he &quot;was institutionalized as a teen, and Wario was my only friend&quot;, and that he &quot;find[s] Wario kind of soothing. He&#x27;s just got a friendly face.&quot;

In the book &quot;A Parent&#x27;s Guide to Nintendo Games: A Comprehensive Look at the Systems and the Games&quot;, Craig Wessel described Wario as a &quot;sinister twist&quot; on Mario. In &quot;Icons of Horror and the Supernatural: An Encyclopedia of Our Worst Nightmares, Volume 1&quot;, S. T. Joshi cites Waluigi and Wario as archetypal examples of alter egos. Wario was used by Todd Harper as an example of the cultural signifiers of fatness that were specifically being created as traits typical of fat characters in fighting games as a whole in a paper for the &quot;Journal of Electronic Gaming and Esports&quot;. They mentioned that Wario possesses a unique move in which he uses his teeth to efficiently chomp through anything, including other fighters, explosives, and even his own motorcycle. He was also being described as a &quot;slob&quot; archetype.

Magazines have also praised Wario&#x27;s outfit, particularly in &quot;Mario Golf: Super Rush&quot;. In September 2021, Peter Nguyen, a professional stylist for &quot;The Essential Man&quot;, commented on a Hiking Wario outfit in &quot;Mario Kart Tour&quot;, calling it &quot;stylish&quot; and saying, &quot;I think this is the most wearable and strongest appearance for Wario&quot;. He was also described as a &quot;fashion icon&quot;. A screenshot of &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020&quot; showing Wario in swimwear appeared to depict him without nipples, leading fans and video game website &quot;Polygon&quot; to speculate about his lack of anatomical features.

<text>Super Mario 64 is a 1996 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It was released in Japan and North America in 1996 and PAL regions in 1997. It is the first &quot;Super Mario&quot; game to feature 3D gameplay, combining traditional &quot;Super Mario&quot; gameplay, visual style, and characters in a large open world. In the game, Bowser, the primary antagonist of the &quot;Super Mario&quot; franchise, invades Princess Peach&#x27;s castle and hides the castle&#x27;s sources of protection, the Power Stars, in many different worlds inside magical paintings. As Mario, the player collects Power Stars to unlock enough of Princess Peach&#x27;s castle to get to Bowser and rescue Princess Peach.

Director Shigeru Miyamoto conceived a 3D &quot;Super Mario&quot; game during the production of &quot;Star Fox&quot; (1993). Development lasted nearly three years: about one year on design and twenty months on production, starting with designing the virtual camera system. The team continued with illustrating the 3D character models—at the time a relatively unattempted task—and refining sprite movements. The sound effects were recorded by Yoji Inagaki and the score was composed by Koji Kondo.

&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was highly anticipated by video game journalists and audiences, boosted by advertising campaigns and showings at the 1996E3 trade show. It received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising its ambition, visuals, level design, and gameplay, though some criticized its virtual camera system. It is the best-selling Nintendo 64 game, with nearly twelvemillion copies sold by 2015.

Retrospectively, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; has been considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Numerous developers have cited it as an influence on 3D platform games, with its dynamic camera system and 360-degree analog control establishing a new archetype for the genre, much as &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; did for side-scrolling platform games. It was remade as &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; for the Nintendo DS in 2004, and has been ported to other Nintendo consoles since. The game has attracted a cult following, spawning many fangames and mods, a large speedrunning presence, and enduring rumors surrounding game features.
== Gameplay ==
=== Controls ===

&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; is a 3D platformer in which the player controls the titular character Mario through various courses. Mario&#x27;s abilities are far more diverse than in previous games. He can walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl, climb, swim, kick, grab objects, and punch using the game controller&#x27;s analog stick and buttons. He can execute special jumps by combining a regular jump with other actions, including the double and triple jumps, long jump, backflip, and wall jump. The player can adjust the camera—operated by a Lakitu broadcasting Mario—and toggle between first-person and third-person view.

=== Health, lives, and power-ups ===
Unlike many of its predecessors, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; uses a health point system, represented by a pie shape consisting of eight segments. If Mario has taken damage, he can replenish his health either by collecting three types of coins—yellow, which replenishes one segment; red, equal to two yellow coins; and blue, equal to five yellow coins, by walking through a spinning heart or by jumping into water. Underwater, Mario&#x27;s health instead represents how long he can hold his breath, slowly diminishing while underwater and replenishing when he surfaces. Finishing a course grants Mario an extra life for every 50 yellow coins the player collected, and extra life mushrooms are hidden in various places such as treesand poles - they may either chase Mario through the air or fall to the ground and disappear shortly if not collected.

In absence of the power-ups normally found in previous games, such as the Super Mushroom and Fire Flower, three colors of translucent blocks—red, green, and blue—appear throughout many stages. Three switches of the same colors can be found in secret areas that turn their corresponding blocks solid and allow Mario to obtain three types of special cap power-ups. The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly after doing a triple jump or being shot from a cannon; the Metal Cap makes him immune to enemies, fire, noxious gases, allows him to withstand wind and water currents, perform on-land moves underwater, and have unlimited air capacity underwater; and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and invulnerable, and allows him to walk through some obstacles. Another implicit powerup is the shell remains after stomping a Koopa Troopa, which Mario can use to run over enemies, and surf on water, lava, and quicksand.

=== Setting and objective ===
The hub world takes place in Princess Peach&#x27;s Castle, which consists of three floors consisting of the castle&#x27;s lobby, the main tower, and a basement, plus a moat and a courtyard outside the castle. The player&#x27;s main objective is to look for paintings that, when jumped into, bring them into courses containing Power Stars, which upon their collection unlock more of the castle hub world. Each of the fifteen courses has seven Power Stars (six from named missions and one gained by collecting 100 coins in the level), and an additional fifteen are hidden as secrets and as bonuses, for a total of 120 Power Stars in the game.

The courses are filled with enemies as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance or ask favors, such as Bob-omb Buddies, who will allow Mario to access cannons on request. Some Power Stars only appear after completing certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges include collecting one hundred yellow coins or eight red coins on a stage, defeating a boss, racing an opponent, and solving puzzles. The final level of the game is blocked by &quot;endless stairs&quot; similar to the Penrose stairs concept, but Mario can bypass them by collecting seventy Power Stars. The music in the endless stairs before collecting seventy Power Stars resembles a Shepard scale. There are many hidden mini-courses and other secrets within the castle, which may contain extra Power Stars required for the full completion of the game. If the player returns to the game after collecting all 120 Power Stars, Yoshi can be found on the roof of Princess Peach&#x27;s Castle, who will give the player a message from the developers, accompanied by one hundred extra lives and an improved triple jump.

== Plot ==
Princess Peach uses a letter to invite Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him. When he arrives, Mario discovers that Bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within its walls using the power of the castle&#x27;s 120 Power Stars. The Power Stars are hidden in the castle&#x27;s paintings, which serve as portals to other worlds where Bowser&#x27;s minions keep watch over the Stars. Mario explores the castle and enters these worlds, gaining access to more rooms as he recovers more Stars. Mario unlocks three doors to different floors of the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in hidden worlds. After getting at least 70 of the 120 Stars, Mario breaks the curse of the endless stairs that block the entrance to Bowser&#x27;s final hiding place. After Mario defeats Bowser in the final battle, and Bowser escapes, swearing revenge, he obtains a special Power Star which gives him the Wing Cap, and he flies back to the castle&#x27;s courtyard. Peach is released from the stained-glass window above the castle&#x27;s entrance, and she rewards Mario by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him.

Once Mario earns all 120 stars, he is able to access the roof of the castle via a cannon on the castle grounds, where Yoshi awaits him. Yoshi congratulates Mario on securing all 120 stars and grants him 99 extra lives in order to continue playing the game.

== Development ==
In the early 1990s, &quot;Super Mario&quot; creator Shigeru Miyamoto conceived a 3D &quot;Mario&quot; design while developing the game &quot;Star Fox&quot; (1993) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. &quot;Star Fox&quot; used the Super FX graphics chip, which added more processing power; Miyamoto considered using the chip to develop a Super NES game, &quot;Super Mario FX&quot;, with gameplay based on &quot;an entire world in miniature, like miniature trains&quot;. According to engineer Dylan Cuthbert, who worked on &quot;Star Fox&quot;, &quot;Super Mario FX&quot; was never the title of a game, but was the codename of the Super FX chip itself. Miyamoto reformulated the idea for the Nintendo 64, not for its greater power, but because its controller has more buttons for gameplay. At the January1993 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), where &quot;Star Fox&quot; made its debut, Nintendo&#x27;s booth demonstrated a talking 3D polygon animation of Mario&#x27;s head; it returned in the start screen, programmed by Giles Goddard.

Production of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; began on September 7, 1994, at Nintendo&#x27;s Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development division, and concluded on May 20, 1996. According to Miyamoto, the development team consisted of around fifteen to twenty people. Development began with the characters and the camera system; months were spent selecting a view and layout. The original concept involved the fixed path of an isometric game such as &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;, which moved to a free-roaming 3D design, with some linear paths, particularly to coerce the player into Bowser&#x27;s lair, according to Giles Goddard.

&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; is one of the first games for which Nintendo produced its illustrations internally instead of by outsourcing. The graphics were made using N-World, a Silicon Graphics (SGI)-based toolkit. The development team prioritized Mario&#x27;s movement and, before levels were created, tested and refined Mario&#x27;s animations on a simple grid. The 3D illustrations were created by Shigefumi Hino, Hisashi Nogami, Hideki Fujii, Tomoaki Kuroume, and Yusuke Nakano, and the game was animated by co-director Yoshiaki Koizumi and Satoru Takiwaza. Yōichi Kotabe, illustrator and character designer for the &quot;Mario&quot; series, made a 3D drawing of Mario from various angles and directed the creation of the character models. In an interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Yoshiaki Koizumi recalled that his challenge was animating the 3D models without any precedents. To assist players with depth perception, the team positioned a faux shadow directly beneath each object regardless of the area&#x27;s lighting. Yoshiaki Koizumi described the feature as an &quot;iron-clad necessity&quot; which &quot;might not be realistic, but it&#x27;s much easier to play&quot;.

Miyamoto&#x27;s guiding design philosophy was to include more details than earlier games by using the Nintendo 64&#x27;s power to feature &quot;all the emotions of the characters&quot;. He likened the game&#x27;s style to a 3D interactive cartoon. Some details were inspired by the developers&#x27; personal lives; for example, the Boos are based on assistant director Takashi Tezuka&#x27;s wife, who, as Miyamoto explained, &quot;is very quiet normally, but one day she exploded, maddened by all the time Tezuka spent at work&quot;.

&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was first run on an SGI Onyx emulator, which only emulated the console&#x27;s application programming interface and not its hardware. The first test scenario for controls and physics involved Mario interacting with a golden rabbit, named &quot;MIPS&quot; after the Nintendo 64&#x27;s MIPS architecture processors; the rabbit was included in the final game as a Power Star holder. &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; features more puzzles than earlier &quot;Mario&quot; games. It was developed simultaneously with &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot; but, as &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; was released more than two years later, some puzzles were taken for &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;. The developers tried to include a multiplayer cooperative mode, whereby players would control Mario and his brother Luigi in split-screen. Nevertheless, hardware constraints and the developers&#x27; inability to implement the mode satisfactorily led to its removal.
The music was composed by veteran composer Koji Kondo, who created new interpretations of the familiar melodies from earlier media as well as new material. Yoji Inagaki was responsible for the sound design, tasked with producing hundreds of sound effects. He and Kondo felt that music and sound effects were equally important. According to Inagaki, the average Nintendo 64 game had about 500 sound effects, and made comparisons to &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, with 1,200, and &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, with 2,000.

&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; is one of the first games to feature Charles Martinet as the voice of Mario, and Leslie Swan—then senior editor of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; and English localizer for &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;—as the voice of Princess Peach.

== Release ==
&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was first shown as a playable prototype in November1995 at Nintendo Space World. This version was only fifty percent complete, and only about two percent of texture mapping was finished. It featured thirty-two courses. Miyamoto had hoped to create more, possibly up to forty, but was ultimately reduced to fifteen. According to Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln, Miyamoto&#x27;s desire to add more was a major factor in the decision to delay the Nintendo 64 release from Christmas1995 to Summer 1996. Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi later said: &quot;Game creators can finish games quickly if they compromise. But users have sharp eyes. They soon know if the games are compromised. [Miyamoto] asked for two more months and I gave them to him unconditionally&quot;. The game was later shown at E31996 with multiple Nintendo 64s set up for people to play. According to Giles Goddard, the stress of the project caused some programmers to quit or move to different departments.

=== Advertising and sales ===
Peter Main, Nintendo&#x27;s vice president of marketing at the time, stated &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was meant as the killer app for the Nintendo 64. The million marketing campaign included videotapes sent to more than five hundred thousand &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; subscribers and advertisements shown on MTV, Fox, and Nickelodeon.

&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was officially released in Japan in June1996, North America in September, and in Europe and Australia in March1997. During its first three months of sale in North America, it sold more than twomillion copies and grossed $140million in the United States, becoming the best-selling video game of 1996. It was also the best-selling game overall from 1995 to 2002. During the first three months of 1997, it was the second-best-selling console game at 523,000 units. By early 2001, it had sold 5.5million units, and 5.9million by September2002.

At the 1999 Milia festival in Cannes, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; won a Gold ECCSELL prize for earning revenues above million in the European Union in 1998. It had become the second most popular game on Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console by June2007, behind &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; By March2008, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; sold 11.8million copies worldwide, being the best-selling Nintendo 64 game. By 2015, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was the 12th most sold &quot;Mario&quot; game, with 11.91million copies sold.

=== Re-releases ===
==== &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; ====
An enhanced remake, &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot;, was released for the Nintendo DS in 2004. As with the original, the plot centers on collecting Power Stars and rescuing Princess Peach from Bowser. In contrast with the original, Yoshi is the starting character, with Mario, Luigi, and Wario as unlockable characters. It features improved graphics, slightly altered courses, new areas, powerups, and enemies, more Power Stars to collect, touchscreen mini-games, and a multiplayer mode. Reviews were mostly positive, with critics praising the graphics and add-ons to the original game but criticizing the controls and multiplayer mode. By September2021, 11.06million copies had been sold worldwide.

==== Other re-releases ====
A version of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was used as a tech demo for the Nintendo 64 Disk Drive (64DD) floppy drive at the 1996 Nintendo Space World trade show. Like &quot;Wave Race 64&quot;, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was re-released in Japan on as which fixed various bugs, added support for the Rumble Pak peripheral, included the voice acting from the English version, among other changes.

In November2003, it was ported to China&#x27;s iQue Player as a limited-release demo. In late 2006, it was released on the Wii Virtual Console service which added enhanced resolution and compatibility with the GameCube and Super Famicom Classic controllers. In September2020, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was one of the three &quot;Super Mario&quot; games to be included in the &quot;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&quot; collection on Nintendo Switch. This version was based on the &quot;Rumble Pak&quot; iteration, and updated the game&#x27;s presentation to display at 720p resolution in both the Switch&#x27;s docked and handheld configurations, in addition to using upscaled user interface assets and textures. It also features a new control scheme that accommodates the wider button array of the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con and Pro Controller, and was later patched to add compatibility for the Nintendo 64 controller used with the Nintendo Switch Online service. It made another Nintendo Switch appearance in October2021 as part of the Nintendo 64 lineup for the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reviews ===
&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; received enthusiastic pre-release reception. &quot;GamePro&quot; commented on the 1995 prototype&#x27;s smoothness, and how the action &quot;was a blast&quot;, despite the game being only fifty percent complete at the time. Ed Semrad of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; agreed, praising the new 3D animation of &quot;Mario&quot; characters shown in only 2D before. Larry Marcus, a source analyst for Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, recalls &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; being the most anticipated game of E31996, remembering a field of teenagers &quot;jostling for a test run&quot;.

&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; received critical acclaim, with a score of 94 out of 100 from review aggregator Metacritic based on thirteen reviews, and a score of 96% from review aggregator GameRankings, which ranked it the eighteenth best video game of all time based on twenty-two reviews.

The design, variety of controls and use of 3D gameplay received praise from video game publications. &quot;Maximum&quot; found its strongest points were the sense of freedom and its replayability, comparing it to &quot;Super Mario World&quot; and citing its similar gimmick of allowing access to new areas upon finding switches. One of &quot;GameFan&quot; four reviewers, E. Storm, cited the water levels as &quot;overjoy[ing]&quot; and showed how &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; delved into an &quot;entirely new realm of gaming&quot;. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; called it &quot;beautiful in both looks and design&quot;. Doug Perry of &quot;IGN&quot; agreed that it transitioned the series to 3D perfectly. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; discussed the levels in their initial review, praising them for their size and challenge, and later ranked it the fourth best console game of all time, arguing that it had breached the entire genre of 3D gaming while working virtually flawlessly.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; editor Paul Davies praised the 3D environment, and said that it enhanced the interaction, and described the control scheme as intuitive and versatile. &quot;Total!&quot; hailed the gameplay as being so imaginative and having such variety that their reviewers were still &quot;hooked&quot; after one month. Writing for &quot;AllGame&quot;, Jonti Davies commented on the diversity of the gameplay and the abundance of activities found in each course. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; Corbie Dillard agreed, calling the variety the game&#x27;s &quot;greatest genius&quot;. Writing for &quot;GameRevolution&quot;, Nebojsa Radakovic described &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; as one of the few &quot;true&quot; 3D platform games. &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; likened it to an enormous playground which was a pleasure to experiment in, but opined that the exploration element was slightly brought down by how many hints and tips there were. Victor Lucas of &quot;EP Daily&quot; agreed, praising the freedom, but suggesting players &quot;skip all the sign posts&quot;.

&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; also received praise for its graphics. &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the graphics for being &quot;clean yet simple&quot; and not detracting from the details of the game world. &quot;GamePro&quot; particularly praised the combination of unprecedented technical performance and art design, calling it &quot;the most visually impressive game of all time&quot;. Paul Davies described the graphics as &quot;so amazing to see, you find yourself stopping to admire [them]&quot;. Jonti Davies called the visuals phenomenal, and the frame rate respectable.&quot;&quot; Doug Perry found the graphics simple but magnificent, a sentiment shared by &quot;Next Generation&quot;. &quot;Hyper&quot; reviewer Nino Alegeropoulos called it the best-looking console game to date and opined that its high resolution and frame rate for the time made it look &quot;infinitely better than a cartoon&quot;. &quot;Total!&quot; said that the graphics&#x27; lack of pixellation and jagged edges made it look like they were from a &quot;top of the range graphics workstation&quot;.

The camera system received mixed reviews. &quot;Next Generation&quot; found that &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was less accessible than previous &quot;Mario&quot; games, frustrated by the camera&#x27;s occasional erratic movements and lack of optimal angle. Nebojsa Radakovic and Doug Perry added that the camera was sometimes blocked by or went through objects. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; Dan Hsu, Shawn Smith, and Crispin Boyer all removed half a point from their scores, claiming that the camera sometimes could not move to a wanted angle or rapidly shifted in an undesirable manner, a criticism that returned in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; &quot;100 Best Games of All Time&quot; list. &quot;Game Informer&quot; stated in their 2007 re-review by present-day standards the camera &quot;would almost be considered broken&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; also noted the learning curve of the shifting camera. In contrast, Corbie Dillard claimed that the camera did not have any problems, and that it succeeded at helping the player traverse complex environments. This sentiment was shared by &quot;Total!&quot;, claiming that there were very few occasions where the camera was at a suboptimal angle. Paul Davies acknowledged that he was critical of the camera, saying that in some occasions it was difficult to position ideally, but ultimately dismissed it as &quot;one hiccup&quot; of a &quot;revolutionary&quot; game.

=== Awards ===
&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; won numerous awards, including various &quot;Game of the Year&quot; honors by members of the gaming media, and in Nintendo&#x27;s own best-selling Player&#x27;s Choice selection. It has been placed high on &quot;the greatest games of all time&quot; lists by many reviewers, including &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;Game Informer&quot;, &quot;Edge&quot;, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine,&quot; &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, and &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; awarded it a Gold award in its initial review, and it won &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; Game of the Year for both editors&#x27; pick and readers&#x27; pick, and Nintendo 64 Game of the Year, Adventure Game of the Year, and Best Graphics. At the 1997 Computer Game Developers Conference, it was given Spotlight Awards for Best Use of Innovative Technology, Best Console Game, and Best Game of 1996. &quot;Maximum&quot; gave it a &quot;Maximum Game of the Month Award&quot; before its international release, ranking it the greatest game the magazine had ever reviewed. &quot;Digitiser&quot; ranked it the best game of 1997, above &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; as runner-up.

== Legacy ==

&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was key to the early success of and anticipation for the Nintendo 64. Lee Hutchinson, a former Babbage&#x27;s employee, notes how the game was spurred by a feverish video game press, and how the success of the game defied the rule that a wide variety of launch games was necessary for broad appeal. Eventually, the Nintendo 64 lost much of its market share to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation, partly due to its cartridge and controller design decisions, which were reportedly implemented by Miyamoto for &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was among the 80 entries in the Smithsonian American Art Museum&#x27;s The Art of Video Games exhibit.

=== Influence ===
&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; set many precedents for 3D platformers as one of the most influential video games. The game is known for its nonlinear, open freedom, which has been acclaimed by video game developers and journalists. &quot;1Up.com&quot; wrote about its central hub world, which provides a safe tutorial and a level selector, and is now a staple of the 3D platformer genre. As the genre evolved, many of the series&#x27;s conventions were rethought drastically, placing emphasis on exploration over traditional platform jumping, or &quot;hop and bop&quot; action. Though some disputed its quality, others argued that it established an entirely new genre for the series. Its mission-based level design inspired game designers such as &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; (1997) producer and director Martin Hollis and the development team of &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot;. Dan Houser, a prominent figure in the development of the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series, stated, &quot;Anyone who makes 3D games who says they&#x27;ve not borrowed something from &quot;Mario&quot; or &quot;Zelda&quot; [of the Nintendo 64] is lying&quot;. Square Enix has stated that a coincidental meeting with Disney employees resulted in the creation of the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, inspired by &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; use of 3D environments and exploration. Chris Sutherland, who served as the lead designer for &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, agreed that &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; set the benchmark for 3D platformers and claimed that any other game in the genre on the Nintendo 64 would inevitably be compared with &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;.

&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; introduced a free-floating camera that can be controlled independently of the character. To increase freedom of exploration and fluid control in a 3D world, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; designers created a dynamic virtual video camera that turns and accelerates according to the character&#x27;s actions. This camera system became the standard for 3D platformers. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; praised the game&#x27;s camera movements along with &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot; addition of the lock-on camera and concluded that the two games were trailblazers for the 3D era. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; K. Thor Jensen considers &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; to be the first truly realized 3D platformer with the integration of camera control into its core gameplay, which he called the medium&#x27;s true evolutionary leap.

&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; use of the analog stick was novel, offering more precise and wide-ranging character movements than the digital D-pads of other consoles. At the time, 3D games generally only allowed the player to either control the character in relation to a fixed camera angle or in relation to the character&#x27;s perspective. &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; controls, in contrast, are fully analog and interpret a 360-degree range of motion into navigation through a 3D space relative to the camera. The analog stick allows for precise control over subtleties such as running speed. In 2005, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; ranked &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; the most important game since they began publication in 1989, stating that, while there were 3D games before it, &quot;Nintendo&#x27;s was the first to get the control scheme right&quot;.

In July2021, a pristine, sealed copy of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was auctioned for , the largest amount ever paid for a video game. Heritage Auctions&#x27;s video games specialist said, &quot;It seems impossible to overstate the importance of this title, not only to the history of Mario and Nintendo but to video games as a whole&quot;.

=== Successors ===
A sequel was planned for the disk drive add-on, under the codename &quot;Super Mario 128&quot;. In July1996, Nintendo insiders stated that Miyamoto was assembling a team consisting mostly of developers who had worked on &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;. Miyamoto affirmed that work on the sequel had only commenced at the time of the E31997 convention. The project was canceled due to its lack of progress and the commercial failure of the Nintendo 64 Disk Drive.

&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; successors include &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; for the GameCube and &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; for the Wii, building on its core design of power-ups and its 3D, open-ended gameplay. &quot;Super Mario Galaxy 2&quot; includes a remake of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; Whomp&#x27;s Fortress level called Throwback Galaxy. &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; and &quot;Super Mario 3D World&quot; are departures from the open-ended design, instead focused on platforming reminiscent of 2D games.

The Nintendo Switch game &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot; returns to &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; open design; it includes numerous references to the latter. The ″&quot;Mario 64&quot; Suit&#x27; and &quot;&#x27;Mario 64&quot; Cap&#x27;, which change Mario&#x27;s appearance to his in &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, can be purchased after completing the main storyline. Additionally, Mario can travel to the Mushroom Kingdom, which includes Princess Peach&#x27;s Castle and its courtyard. The Kingdom&#x27;s Power Moons resemble &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; Power Stars.

=== Rumors, conspiracy theories, and glitches ===

Rumors spread rapidly after the game&#x27;s release. The most popular was a pervasive rumor that Luigi existed as an unlockable character. In 1996, &quot;IGN&quot; offered a prize of $100 if a player could find Luigi, to no avail. Fueling the rumor was a very blurry message on a statue in the courtyard of Princess Peach&#x27;s Castle, thought to say &quot;L is real 2401&quot;. This was disproved in 1998, when a fan received a letter from Nintendo that the programmers included the text as a joke and it was not supposed to say anything. In July2020, 24 years and 1 month after the initial release of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, unused assets for Luigi from the scrapped multiplayer mode were discovered in the game&#x27;s development files, in an event known as the Nintendo Gigaleak.

Satirical conspiracy theories about the game became popular in the early 2020s. These theories were grouped into an Internet meme of an iceberg known as the &quot;&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; iceberg&quot;, with less likely theories representing places being placed closer to the bottom of the &quot;ocean&quot;. One popular theory was the &quot;Wario Apparition&quot;, based on an E31996 presentation with Charles Martinet voicing a disembodied Wario head. Some fans believed that the Wario head remained in some copies of the game. Conspiracy theorists have also spread the rumor that &quot;every copy of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; is personalized&quot;, claiming that certain bizarre phenomena existed in only certain copies of the game.

In the years since the game&#x27;s release, players have used glitches to reach previously unreachable parts of the game, including, in 2014, a coin not possible to be collected in ordinary play. Speedrun techniques include the Lakitu skip, a glitch that disables a dialog box explaining camera movement; the Bob-omb clip, which uses a glitch in a Bob-omb&#x27;s explosion animation to clip through walls; and the backwards long jump glitch, which involves the player performing a repetitive move, the &quot;backwards long jump&quot; (BLJ), allowing Mario to reach very high speed values and has numerous applications in speedrunning; the latter was patched in the &quot;Rumble Pak&quot; re-release in 1997 as well as the &quot;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&quot; re-release (with the &quot;3D All-Stars&quot; version being based on the &quot;Rumble Pak&quot; version&#x27;s codebase). In 2013, YouTuber Vinesauce posted a compilation of various corruptions of the game, replicated with a program named &quot;naughty&quot;. Another YouTuber, Pannenkoek2012, creates highly technical and analytical videos of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; glitches and mechanics, which have been covered many times by the video game press. The game has also inspired challenges that attempt to beat it with certain restrictions, such as not being able to press the A button, requiring deep understanding about the game&#x27;s mechanics and bugs. In May 2024, a player named Marbler managed to beat the entire game without pressing the A button.

=== Fan projects ===
&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; has led to the creation of fan-made remakes, modifications and ROM hacks:
* &quot;Super Mario 64: Chaos Edition&quot;, a PC-emulated version of the original that loads codes which cause bizarre behavior. The game received coverage after streaming ensemble Vinesauce posted a playthrough of the game.
* &quot;Super Mario Run 64&quot;, converting the game into a 2.5D running game in the spirit of &quot;Super Mario Run&quot;
* &quot;Super Mario 64 Online&quot;, enabling online multiplayer. It was taken down after a copyright strike by Nintendo. It was later reuploaded and renamed to &quot;Net64&quot;.
* &quot;Super Mario 64 Maker&quot;, a &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot;-like level editor
* &quot;Super Mario 64 Odyssey&quot;, featuring levels based on &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot; and adding its mechanic of possessing enemies by throwing Mario&#x27;s hat
* &quot;Super Mario 64: Last Impact&quot;, an original game that incorporates elements from other &quot;Mario&quot; games, such as the Fire Flower from &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, the F.L.U.D.D. cannon from &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;, and the Bee Mushroom from &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot;
* &quot;Super Mario 64: Ocarina of Time&quot;, in which the world of &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot; is recreated in &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, with new gameplay elements, puzzles, and a story
* &quot;Open World Mario 64&quot;, a battle royale–style mod set on a huge map made up of all &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; levels, in the style of &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot; and &quot;PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot;
* &quot;First Person Mario 64&quot;, a modification that fixes the camera configuration on first-person, often making the game much more challenging due to how the game demands acrobatic movements, and how the game does not render objects when they&#x27;re too close to the camera.
* &quot;Super Mario 64 FPS&quot;, a first-person shooter remake of the original, speedran by YouTubers Falsepog and Alpharad
* &quot;Super Mario 64 HD&quot;, a high-definition remake of the first level of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, Bob-Omb Battlefield, using the Unity game engine. The project was taken down following a copyright claim by Nintendo.

==== Decompilation ====
In 2019, fans decompiled the original ROM image into C source code, allowing &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; to be natively ported to any system. The next year, fans released a Windows port with support for widescreen displays and 4K resolution. The port would allow for more graphical mods and forks, such as &quot;Render96&quot;, which implemented the original high-resolution source textures and created new character models and environments resembling those seen in the game&#x27;s CG renders, and &quot;Super Mario 64 Plus&quot;, a fork of the Windows port featuring a new permanent death option, bug fixes, and an improved camera system. Fans have also created ports for several different platforms, including the Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Vita, Dreamcast, and Android. Nintendo has enlisted a law firm to remove videos of the port and its listings from various websites, taking them down via copyright claims.

=== Medical literature ===
In 2013, a study was conducted to see the plasticity effects on the human brain after playing &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;—chosen for its navigation element and the ability to play in a three-dimensional environment—for at least thirty minutes every day for two months. The study concluded that doing the previously mentioned activity caused the gray matter (a major part of the central nervous system) to increase in the right hippocampal formation and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex—brain areas thought to contribute to spatial navigation, working memory, and motor planning.

<text>A gossip columnist is someone who writes a gossip column in a newspaper or magazine, especially in a gossip magazine. Gossip columns are written in a light, informal style, and relate opinions about the personal lives or conduct of celebrities from show business (motion picture movie stars, theater, and television actors), politicians, professional sports stars, and other wealthy people or public figures. Some gossip columnists broadcast segments on radio and television.

The columns mix factual material on arrests, divorces, marriages and pregnancies, which are obtained from official records, with more speculative gossip stories, rumors, and innuendo about romantic relationships, affairs, and purported personal problems.

Gossip columnists have a reciprocal relationship with the celebrities whose private lives are splashed about in the gossip column&#x27;s pages. While gossip columnists sometimes engage in (borderline) defamatory conduct, spreading innuendo about alleged immoral or illegal conduct that can injure celebrities&#x27; reputations, they also serve as an important part of the publicity machine that turns actors and musicians into celebrities and superstars that are the objects of the public&#x27;s obsessive attention and interest. The publicity agents of celebrities often provide or &quot;leak&quot; information or rumors to gossip columnists to publicize the celebrity or their projects, or to counteract &quot;bad press&quot; that has recently surfaced about their conduct.

==Libel and defamation==
While gossip columnists&#x27; &quot;bread and butter&quot; is rumor, innuendo, and allegations of scandalous behavior, there is a fine line between the legally-acceptable spreading of rumors and the making of defamatory statements, the latter of which can provoke a lawsuit. Newspaper and magazine editorial policies normally require gossip columnists to have a source for all of their allegations to protect the publisher from lawsuits for defamation (libel).

In the United States, celebrities or public figures can sue for libel if their private lives are revealed in a gossip column and they believe that their reputation has been defamed – that is, exposed to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or pecuniary loss. Gossip columnists cannot defend against libel claims by arguing that they merely repeated but did not originate the defaming rumor or claim. Instead, a columnist must prove that the allegedly defaming statement was truthful or that it was based on a reasonably reliable source.

In the mid-1960s, rulings by the United States Supreme Court made it harder for the media to be sued for libel in the US. The Court ruled that libel occurs only if a publication prints falsehoods about a celebrity with &quot;reckless disregard&quot; for the truth. A celebrity suing a newspaper for libel must prove that the paper published the falsehood with actual malice or with deliberate knowledge that the statement was both incorrect and defamatory.

Moreover, the Court ruled that only factual misrepresentation, not expression of opinion, is libel. Thus, if gossip columnists write that they &quot;think that Celebrity X is an idiot&quot;, the columnist does not face a risk of being sued for libel. On the other hand, if columnists invent an allegation that &quot;Celebrity X is a wife beater&quot; with no supporting source or evidence, the celebrity can sue for libel on the grounds that their reputation was defamed.

In some circumstances, however, gossip columnists do not fact-check the information that they receive from their sources before they publish their stories. Also, some gossip columnists who are not themselves reputable post articles about celebrities. As a result, there is a chance of published stories leading to the defamation of celebrities.
==History==
The precursors to gossip columns were the society columns of the 19th and early 20th centuries. James Gordon Bennett Sr. is credited with first creating this position at the New York Herald in 1840.

Walter Winchell, a gossip columnist famous in the 1930s and 1940s, was the first writer to have a syndicated gossip column. Winchell used his political, entertainment, and social connections to mine information and rumors, which he either published in his column &quot;On Broadway&quot; or traded to accumulate more power. He has been referred to as &quot;the most feared journalist&quot; of his era. From the 1930s to the 1950s, the two best-known Hollywood gossip columnists were the competing Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons. 

In Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age&quot; in the 1930s and 1940s, gossip columnists were courted by the movie studios so that the studios could use gossip columns as a powerful publicity tool. During that period, the major film studios had &quot;stables&quot; of contractually-obligated actors, and controlled nearly all aspects of the lives of their movie stars. Well-timed leaks about a star&#x27;s purported romantic adventures helped movie studios to create and sustain public interest in their star actors. The studios&#x27; publicity agents also acted as unnamed &quot;well-informed inside sources.&quot; In this capacity, agents could counteract whispers about celebrity secrets, such as homosexuality or an out-of-wedlock child, which could severely damage both the individual reputation of a movie star and their greater box office viability.

Having fallen into ill-repute after the heyday of Hopper and Parsons, gossip columnists saw a comeback in the 1980s. Many mainstream magazines such as &quot;Time&quot;, which once considered the hiring of gossip columnists as beneath their stature, now have sections titled &quot;People&quot; or &quot;Entertainment&quot;. Such mainstream gossip columns provide a light, chatty glimpse into the private lives and misadventures of the rich and famous.

At the other end of the journalism spectrum, there are entire publications that deal primarily in gossip, rumor, and innuendo about celebrities, such as the British &#x27;red-top&#x27; tabloids and the celebrity &#x27;tell-all&#x27; magazines.

<doc id="100066" wikidata="Q3622115" url="?curid=100066" title="Protected areas of New South Wales">
<text>The Protected areas of New South Wales include both terrestrial and marine protected areas. there are 225 national parks in New South Wales. A number established since the late 1970s followed campaigns by local residents and environmentalists.

Based on the Collaborative Australian Protected Area Database (CAPAD) 2020 data there are 2136 separate terrestrial protected areas with a total land area of (9.61% of the state&#x27;s area). CAPAD data also shows 18 marine protected areas with a total area of , covering 39.63% of NSW waters.

==History==
New South Wales established the first known protected area in Australia, Royal National Park in 1879. The formation of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service in 1967 saw a bid in the conservation of the state&#x27;s diversity of natural ecosystems and cultural heritage. Today New South Wales contains more than 16.4 million acres within 870 protected areas, as well as 225 different national parks, each with their own pristine beauty and tranquil scenery.

==New conservation areas==
In June 2020 the Government of New South Wales acquired , or of private land for a new national park, when it purchased Narriearra station in the state&#x27;s far north-west, subsequently named the Narriearra Caryapundy Swamp National Park. It is the largest ever purchase of private land for conservation in the state, and provides 90 percent of the habitat of the endangered grey grasswren. The Dingo Fence on the border with Queensland forms the northern boundary of the property.

The second largest acquisition ever was made in October 2021, Avenel/Mount Westwood station, north of Broken Hill, comprising . A further of private land, Langidoon and Metford stations, located 65 kilometres east of Broken Hill was also purchased and gazetted in 2021. Koonaburra station, located between Ivanhoe and Cobar, was also purchased and gazetted in the same year.

<text>Protected areas of South Australia, consisting of protected areas located within South Australia and its immediate onshore waters and which are managed by South Australian Government agencies. As of 2018, South Australia contained 359 separate protected areas declared under the &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot;, the &quot;Crown Land Management Act 2009&quot; and the &quot;Wilderness Protection Act 1992&quot;. Together, they cover a total land area of or 21.5% of the state&#x27;s area.

==Jurisdiction==
The jurisdiction for legislation of protected areas within South Australia and the immediate onshore waters known officially as &quot;the coastal waters and waters within the limits of South Australia&quot; is that of the South Australian government. The &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot; authorises the creation and management of protected areas, which form the majority of South Australia’s contribution to the National Reserve System.

Other South Australian legislation that may create protected areas includes the following: &quot;Forestry Act 1950&quot;, &quot;Wilderness Protection Act 1992&quot;, &quot;Historic Shipwrecks Act 1981&quot;, &quot;River Murray Act 2003&quot;, &quot;Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary Act 2005&quot;, &quot;Fisheries Management Act 2007&quot;, &quot;Marine Parks Act 2007&quot;, &quot;Crown Land Management Act 2009&quot;, &quot;Arkaroola Protection Act 2012&quot; and &quot;Native Vegetation Act 1991&quot;.

The Australian Government does not have power under the Australian constitution to legislate for protected areas within South Australia. However, its treaty obligations and its constitutional responsibilities permit the state to develop policies for protected areas and to enter into agreements concerning protected areas. Examples include nomination of sites under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (also known as the Ramsar Convention) and establishment of agreements for Indigenous Protected Areas.

==&quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot;==

The &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot; (also known as the National Parks Act) is the main South Australian legislation authorising the establishment and management of protected areas. It is concerned with the establishment and management of reserves, establishment of sanctuaries, conservation of native plants and animals, declaration of protected animals, management of protected animals in respect to taking, keeping, farming and harvesting, and control of hunting.

The act is administered by the Department for Environment and Water (DEW).

Reserves declared under this act totalled 320, covering an area of or 19.6% of South Australia&#x27;s area. , there were 359 parks in South Australia subject to the act and national parks Regulations.

The following types of reserves are listed within the Act: national parks, conservation parks, game reserves, recreation parks and regional reserves.

<doc id="100073" wikidata="Q2303963" url="?curid=100073" title="Protected areas of Tasmania">
<text>Protected areas of Tasmania consist of protected areas located within Tasmania and its immediate onshore waters, including Macquarie Island. It includes areas of crown land (withheld land) managed by Tasmanian Government agencies as well as private reserves. As of 2016, 52% of Tasmania&#x27;s land area has some form of reservation classification, the majority is managed by the Tasmania Parks &amp; Wildlife Service (about 42% of total Tasmanian land area). Marine protected areas cover about 7.9% of state waters.

Within each classification of reserve there may be a variation of IUCN categories Australia is a signatory to the Convention of Biological Diversity and as such has obligations to report the status of its National Reserve System.IUCN provides on its website a prescription for activities consistent with the categorisation system. Changes made to the &quot;Nature Conservation Act 2002&quot; in 2014 permit timber harvesting. These changes made in addition to the already established right to access minerals means that many of the IUCN categorisations assigned to individual reserves in Tasmania are no longer fit for purpose. In addition many reserves have had their reserve status downgraded from a class excluding timber harvesting and mineral extraction to ones where these activities are now permitted. This mis-application of the IUCN protected area categories needs to be remedied or the reserves protected land class under the Nature Conservation Act 2002 should be adjusted to reflect its currently assigned IUCN category.

==Legislation and management==
*Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service manages crown land reserved under the &quot;Nature Conservation Act 2002&quot;. The 10 classes of protected land are: conservation area, historic site, game reserve, national park, nature recreation area, nature reserve, regional reserve and state reserve. The &quot;National Parks and Reserves Management act 2002&quot; determines the management objectives for each class.
*&#x27;Permanent timber production zone land&#x27; is crown land managed by Sustainable Timber Tasmania under the &quot;Forest Management Act 2013&quot;. It contains areas of informal reserves (e.g. landscape connectivity, streamside buffers, etc.)
*The Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) administers &#x27;future potential production forest&#x27; crown land (formerly &#x27;future reserve land&#x27;) as defined in &quot;The Forestry (Rebuilding the Forest Industry) Act 2014&quot;.
*The Wellington Park Management Trust is outlined in the &quot;Wellington Park Act 1993&quot;.

==Summary of area totals==
At 30 June 2016, Tasmania&#x27;s terrestrial reserves cover (about 50.1% of the area of Tasmania), of which Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service manages 823 reserves (about , or over 42% of the area of Tasmania).

The following table demonstrates the distribution of terrestrial protected areas as of June 2016, any marine areas are excluded. All protected areas not managed by Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service or Sustainable Timber Tasmania is grouped into &quot;other&quot;, including: formal and informal reserves on public land, reserves on private land, and Wellington Park.

==Marine==
===Commonwealth marine reserves===

There are several Commonwealth marine reserves in the vicinity of Tasmania, these reserves are not within state waters and are managed by the Australian government. All of the reserves are part of the South-east Commonwealth Marine Reserve Network which contains an additional 4 reserves.
* Beagle
* Boags
* Flinders
* Franklin
* Freycinet
* Huon
* Macquarie Island
* South Tasman Rise
* Tasman Fracture
* Zeehan
===Tasmanian marine protected areas===
Marine protected areas (MPAs) in Tasmanian state waters are classed as either conservation area, national park or nature reserve. Only the nature reserve or national park class have either restricted fishing or no take zones. Of the approximately of marine protected areas, about is restricted fishing or no take, Macquarie Island (~) is a wholly no-take zone.

In total 7.9% of Tasmania&#x27;s State coastal waters is reserved, however only 4.2% is in no-take areas and the majority of this is concentrated around subantarctic Macquarie Island. Only 1.1% of Tasmania&#x27;s immediate coastal waters are fully protected in no-take areas.

==Private reserves==
Reserves on private land is about 4% of the terrestrial protected areas in Tasmania.

===Conservation Covenant===
Landowners may protect some areas of their land by entering into a Conservation Covenant which is legally binding under the &quot;Nature Conservation Act (2002)&quot; and is registered on the land title. Although usually in perpetuity, about 7% of the covenant area in Tasmania is fixed-term. In December 2016, there were 819 covenants covering an area of about .

===Indigenous Protected Areas===
There are 8 Indigenous Protected Area in Tasmania, covering an area of about .

IUCN V

*Babel Island
*Badger Island
*Great Dog Island
*lungatalanana
*Mt Chappell Island
*Putalina
*Risdon Cove
IUCN VI

*Preminghana
===Private sanctuaries===
Land reserved for the significant natural or cultural values while permitting the carrying out of agricultural or other activities consistent on preserving the values of the land.

==Wellington Park==
Wellington Park is the protected area which encompasses Mount Wellington and surrounds near Hobart. It is IUCN protected area category II and covers an area of about . It is managed by the &quot;Wellington Park Management Trust&quot; established in 1993 whose members include: Hobart and Glenorchy City Councils, Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service, DPIPWE, TasWater and Tourism Tasmania.

==State forest==
===Future potential production forest===
&#x27;Future potential production forest land&#x27; (FPPF or FPPFL) is crown land administered by the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) where, except in some circumstances for &quot;special species timbers&quot;, no native forest harvesting can be undertaken. It was formally classified as &#x27;future reserve land&#x27; (FRL) under the Tasmanian Forests Agreement. FPPF may be converted to &#x27;permanent timber production zone land&#x27; (PTPZ or PTPZL) after 2020.

====Background====
The Tasmanian Forests Agreement which was passed in 2013 after almost 4 years of negotiations, categorised about of crown land native forest as FRL, which included areas of forests of the Styx, Weld, Upper Florentine, Great Western Tiers and Tarkine regions. The fate of FRL was dependent upon Tasmanian forest practices gaining Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification. In the recent 2014 audit, Forestry Tasmania (now Sustainable Timber Tasmania) complied with 193 indicators, but needed further action on 10 more.

In September 2014 the Tasmanian government passed legislation which reclassified the 400,000 hectares of FRL as FPPF. After the expiration of the memorandum in April 2020, areas of FPPF can be converted to PTPZ where native forest logging can occur, subject to parliamentary approval. Until 2020, only limited &quot;special species timber&quot; harvesting can be undertaken in FPPF.

===Permanent timber production zone land===
Sustainable Timber Tasmania is a government business enterprise owned by the Tasmanian Government which manages and operates state forest on crown land (officially classified as &#x27;permanent timber production zone land&#x27;). Some of this land has informal protection and is managed for conservation as part of the Tasmanian CAR reserve system (e.g. habitat for threatened species, streamside protection, landscape connectivity). Informal reserves on the public production forest land cover about .

====Forest reserves====
Forest reserves are located on &#x27;permanent timber production zone land&#x27; and may have recreation or other tourism facilities.
