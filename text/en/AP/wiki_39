<text>Joseph Graham &quot;Gray&quot; Davis Jr. (born December 26, 1942) is an American attorney and former politician who served as the 37th governor of California from 1999 until he was recalled and removed from office in 2003. He is the second state governor in U.S. history to have been recalled, after Lynn Frazier of North Dakota.

A member of the Democratic Party, Davis holds a Bachelor of Arts in history from Stanford University and a Juris Doctor from Columbia Law School. He was awarded a Bronze Star for his service as a captain in the Vietnam War. Prior to serving as governor, Davis was chief of staff to Governor Jerry Brown (1975–1981), a California State Assemblyman (1983–1987), California State Controller (1987–1995) and the 44th lieutenant governor of California (1995–1999).

During his time as governor, Davis made education his top priority and California spent eight billion dollars more than was required under Proposition 98 during his first term. In California, under Davis, standardized test scores increased for five straight years. Davis signed the nation&#x27;s first state law requiring automakers to limit auto emissions. Davis supported laws to ban assault weapons and is also credited with improving relations between California and Mexico. Davis began his tenure as governor with strong approval ratings, but they declined as voters blamed him for the California electricity crisis, the California budget crisis that followed the bursting of the dot-com bubble, and the car tax.

On October 7, 2003, Davis was recalled. In the recall election, 55.4% of voters supported his removal. He was succeeded in office on November 17, 2003, by actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who won the recall replacement election. After being recalled, Davis worked as a lecturer at the UCLA School of Public Affairs and as an attorney at Loeb &amp; Loeb.

==Early life, education, and military service ==
Davis was born in the Bronx, New York City, the son of Doris (Meyer) Morell and Joseph Graham Davis. Davis was the oldest of five children: Three boys and two girls. Davis&#x27;s father, an advertising manager at Time Inc. and an alcoholic, was the son of businessman William Rhodes Davis. Davis&#x27; upper-middle-class family was led by his demanding mother, who gave him the nickname &quot;Gray&quot;. Davis moved to California with his family in 1954.

Davis graduated from a North Hollywood military academy, the Harvard School for Boys (now part of Harvard-Westlake School). His diverse educational experiences at public, private and Catholic schools allowed him an opportunity to compare all three systems as a lawmaker.

Davis&#x27;s academic accomplishments earned him acceptance to Stanford University. He played on the Stanford golf team with a two handicap. After Davis entered Stanford, his father left the family, forcing Davis to join the ROTC to stay in school; his arrangement with ROTC included a promise to enter the Army after completing his education. In 1964, he graduated with distinction from Stanford, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in history. He then returned to New York City to attend Columbia Law School, graduating with his J.D. degree in 1967.

After completing law school in 1967, Davis entered active duty in the United States Army, serving in the Vietnam War during its height until 1969. Davis saw time on the battlefield during his time in Vietnam. Davis returned home as a captain with a Bronze Star Medal for meritorious service. Friends who knew him at the time said Davis—like many war veterans—came back a changed man, interested in politics and more intense, according to the &quot;Sacramento Bee&quot;. He returned from Vietnam more &quot;serious and directed.&quot; Davis was surprised to discover that many of those serving in Vietnam were Latinos, African Americans and southern whites with very few from schools like Stanford and Columbia; Davis believed that the burden of the war should be felt equally and he resolved early on to go about changing America so that would change. Davis is a life member of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars.

==Early career==
Davis volunteered for John V. Tunney&#x27;s campaign for the United States Senate in 1970. He started a statewide neighborhood crime watch program while serving as chairman of the California Council on Criminal Justice. His initial political experience included working to help Tom Bradley win election as Los Angeles&#x27;s first black mayor in 1973. The historical significance of Bradley&#x27;s victory further inspired Davis to pursue a career in politics. Davis ran for state treasurer in 1974 but lost when the more popular Jesse Unruh filed to run on the deadline.

Davis served as executive secretary and chief of staff to Governor Edmund G. &quot;Jerry&quot; Brown Jr. from 1975 to 1981. Davis was not as liberal as Brown, and some said he offset Brown&#x27;s style by projecting a more intense, controlled personality. Davis has stated that while Brown was campaigning for president in 1980, Davis ran the state in Brown&#x27;s absence.

Davis served as the Assemblyman from the 43rd district, representing parts of Los Angeles County including West Los Angeles and Beverly Hills from 1983 to 1987. Davis championed a popular campaign to help find missing children by placing their pictures on milk cartons and grocery bags. Davis&#x27;s Republican opponent in the race, William Campbell, criticized Davis as &quot;...the man special interests love most.&quot; Among other allegations raised by Campbell were disclosures that Davis had received campaign contributions from Eugene LaPietra, a candidate for the West Hollywood City Council who was convicted on federal pornography charges. LaPietra served as Davis’ finance chairman. Davis cut all ties with La Pietra following a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; report on his pornography convictions.

==State Controller==

In 1986, Davis ran against six other contenders in the race for State Controller; several of those candidates, including Democrat John Garamendi and Republican Bill Campbell, were arguably better known at the time. Davis won the election and served as State Controller for eight years until 1995. As California&#x27;s chief fiscal officer, he saved taxpayers more than half a billion dollars by cracking down on Medi-Cal fraud, rooting out government waste and inefficiency and exposing the misuse of public funds. He was the first controller to withhold paychecks from all state elected officials, including himself, until the governor and the Legislature passed an overdue budget. He also found and returned more than $1.8 billion in unclaimed property to California citizens, including forgotten bank accounts, insurance settlements and stocks.

==1992 U.S. Senate campaign==
Davis ran against San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate in the 1992 special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Pete Wilson who was elected Governor of California in 1990.

The race is often cited as an example of Davis&#x27;s history of negative campaign tactics. The Davis campaign featured an ad that compared Feinstein to the incarcerated hotelier Leona Helmsley. Some experts consider that ad to be the most negative in state history. The ad backfired with Davis losing to Feinstein by a significant margin for the nomination although this loss did not stop Davis from using negative campaign ads in the future, including in his race for lieutenant governor.

Davis blamed his campaign managers for the defeat and vowed not to let major decisions in future campaigns be decided by his campaign staff. In 2003, when Feinstein urged voters to vote no during the recall election, she was constantly reminded through questions, video and the media about the 1992 primary.

==Lieutenant Governor of California==
Many Democrats came to believe that Davis&#x27;s political career was over after his defeat in his run for the Senate, but Davis created a new campaign team. He won a landslide victory in his race for lieutenant governor in 1994, receiving more votes than any other Democratic candidate in America. Davis ran as a moderate candidate against Republican Cathie Wright. Davis used ads to depict Wright as a Republican who was too conservative for California. Davis had a large advantage in campaign funds.

As lieutenant governor until 1999, Gray Davis focused on efforts on the California economy and worked to encourage new industries to locate and expand in the state. He also worked to keep college education affordable for California&#x27;s middle-class families and oversaw the largest student-fee reduction in California history. As the state&#x27;s second-highest officeholder, he served as President of the State Senate, Chair of the Commission for Economic Development, Chair of the State Lands Commission, Regent of the University of California and Trustee of the California State University.

==Governor of California==
===1998 gubernatorial campaign===
In the June primary election, Davis surprised political observers by handily defeating two better funded Democratic opponents: multimillionaire airline executive Al Checchi and Congresswoman Jane Harman, wife of multimillionaire Sidney Harman. Davis&#x27;s campaign slogan during the primary was &quot;Experience Money Can&#x27;t Buy.&quot; Early primary polls showed Davis in third for the Democratic nomination. Davis surprised many political insiders with his landslide come-from-behind victory. Davis even finished ahead of the unopposed Republican nominee in California&#x27;s first blanket gubernatorial primary.

Davis won the 1998 general election for governor with 57.9% of the vote, defeating Republican Attorney General Dan Lungren who had 38.4%. Davis aimed to portray himself as a moderate centrist Democrat and to label Lungren a Republican too conservative for California and out of touch with its views on issues like guns and abortion. After his victory, Davis declared that he would work to end the &quot;divisive politics&quot; of his predecessor Pete Wilson. In his campaign, Davis emphasized the need to improve California&#x27;s public schools, which voters had cited as their top concern in this election.

===First term===
====Popular start and education====
In 1998, Davis was elected the Golden State&#x27;s first Democratic governor in 16 years. &quot;The San Jose Mercury News&quot; called him &quot;perhaps the best-trained governor-in-waiting California has ever produced.&quot; In March 1999, Davis enjoyed a 58% approval rating and just 12% disapproval. His numbers peaked in February 2000 with 62% approval and 20% disapproval, coinciding with the peak of the dot-com boom in California. Davis held his strong poll numbers into January 2001.

Davis&#x27;s first official act as governor was to call a special session of the state legislature to address his plan for all California children to be able to read by age 9.

Davis used California&#x27;s growing budget surplus to increase education spending. He signed legislation that provided for a new statewide accountability program and for the Academic Performance Index and supported the high school exit exam. He signed legislation that authorized the largest expansion of the Cal Grant program. Under the Davis administration, California began recognizing students for outstanding academic achievement in math and sciences on the new Golden State Exams. Davis&#x27;s Governors Scholarship program provided $1,000 scholarships to those students who scored in the top 1% in two subject areas on the state&#x27;s annual statewide standardized test.

Davis signed into law legislation that began the Eligibility in the Local Context (ELC) program that guaranteed admission to a University of California institution to students that finished in the top 4% of their high school class. Public schools received $8 billion over the minimum required by Proposition 98 during Davis&#x27;s first term. Davis increased spending on recruiting more and better-qualified teachers. He campaigned to lower the approval threshold for local school bonds from two-thirds to 55 percent in a statewide proposition that passed. Davis earmarked $3 billion over four years for new textbooks and, between 1999 and 2004, increased state per-pupil spending from $5,756 to $6,922.

In 2001, Gov. Gray Davis signed Senate Bill 19, which establishes nutritional standards for food at elementary schools and bans the sale of carbonated beverages in elementary and middle schools.

Another early act of Davis&#x27;s was the reversal of his predecessor Republican Governor Pete Wilson&#x27;s alteration of California&#x27;s eight-hour overtime pay rule for wage earners.

====Signing SB 400 into law====
In 1999, the CalPERS board proposed a benefits expansion that would allow public employees to retire at age 55 and collect more than half their highest salary for life (pension spiking). CalPERS predicted the benefits would require no increase in the State&#x27;s contributions by projecting an average annual return of 8.25% over the next decade. When Board member Phil Angelides&#x27; aide questioned whether the stock market could grow that long, Board Chairman William Crist, a former union president, replied that they &quot;could make all sorts of different assumptions and make predictions, but that&#x27;s really more than I think we can expect our staff to do.&quot; CalPERS&#x27; chief actuary, objected, finding that it would be &quot;fairly catastrophic&quot; if the fund only grew at 4.4%. The benefits expansion bill, SB 400, passed with unanimous backing by California State Assembly Democrats and was signed into law by Governor Gray Davis. CalPERS then produced a video promoting the legislation with Chairman Crist promising greater benefits &quot;without imposing any additional cost on the taxpayers&quot; and the California State Employees Association president praising it as &quot;the biggest thing since sliced bread&quot;. The next year the dot-com bubble burst, and CalPERS did not grow, instead losing value in the stock market downturn of 2002. In 2001–2002, CalPERS provided technical assistance for the Sarbanes-Oxley Act because it had sustained financial losses from the Enron and WorldCom bankruptcies. After the Great Recession, in 2009 CalPERS investments lost 24%, dropping $67 billion in value. Chairman Crist retired from the board and it was later revealed he had accepted more than $800,000 from a firm to ensure hundreds of millions of investment from CalPERS. This CalPERS mess was one of the factors that made Gray Davis get recalled. Governor Jerry Brown worked on trying to fix this retirement system for years, but CalPERS is still underfunded in 2022 and could end up costing state tax payers hundreds of billions in bailouts.

====Domestic partnerships====
Davis recognized the domestic partnerships registry in 1999 and, in 2001, gave same-sex partners a few of the rights enjoyed by opposite-sex spouses such as making health care decisions for an incapacitated partner, acting as a conservator and inheriting property. He also signed a bill to prevent disqualification from a jury based on sexual orientation. Additionally, he signed a bill allowing employees to use family leave to care for a domestic partner, though he did not make good on a campaign promise to convene a task force on civil unions.

====Guns and public safety====
He signed laws in 1999 banning assault weapons by characteristic rather than brand name, as well as limiting handgun purchases to one a month, requiring trigger locks with all sales of new firearms and reducing the sale of cheap handguns. Davis&#x27;s ban included a ban on .50 caliber firearms and so-called &quot;Saturday Night Specials.&quot; In 2001, Davis signed a bill requiring gun buyers to pass a safety test.

====Crime====
A supporter of the death penalty and tougher sentencing laws, Davis blocked nearly all parole recommendations by the parole board. Davis campaigned as an ardent supporter of capital punishment; which reportedly played a crucial part in his successful gubernatorial campaign. In 1999, he denied his first clemency request from Thai national Jaturun Siripongs, stating, &quot;Model behavior cannot bring back the lives of the two innocent murder victims.&quot; Siripongs was executed in February 1999; the first execution to occur during Davis&#x27;s governorship.

====Relations with Mexico====
Early in 1999, Davis sought to improve relations with Mexico. Davis believed that California under Pete Wilson had left millions of dollars of potential trade revenues &quot;on the table.&quot; Davis said he wanted California to have relations with Mexico that were more like Texas under then-Governor George W. Bush. Controversy over the California-Mexico border and California Proposition 187 had strained the relationship between the two parties. Davis met with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo to improve relations with California&#x27;s southern neighbor and major trading partner within Davis&#x27;s first 30 days in office. Davis later met with President Vicente Fox and participated in his inauguration. The Governor met with Mexican presidents eight times. Under the Davis administration, California and Baja California signed a &quot;Memorandum of Understanding&quot; expanding cooperation in several policy areas. Under Davis, Mexico became California&#x27;s leading export market for the first time in history and California&#x27;s trade with Mexico surpassed all of Mexico&#x27;s trade with Latin America, Europe and Asia combined. Because of the growth in the California economy, Davis opened and expanded trade offices around the world, including in Mexico. But most of these offices were eliminated in the 2003 California budget due to difficult fiscal times.

====Health, environment, business, and transportation====
Davis significantly expanded the number of low-income children with state-subsidized health coverage. He signed laws to allow patients to get a second opinion if their HMO denies treatment and, in limited cases, the right to sue. Davis signed legislation that provided HMO patients a bill of rights, including a help-line to resolve disputes and independent medical review of claims. Under Davis, staff-to-patient ratios in nursing homes improved. However, Davis reneged on a campaign promise to expand low-cost healthcare to parents of needy children due to budget constraints.

Davis allowed non-disabled low-income people with HIV to be treated under Medi-Cal. He signed a law allowing people participating in needle exchange programs to be immune from criminal prosecution. He also increased state spending on AIDS prevention.

Under Governor Davis, California&#x27;s anti-tobacco campaign became one of the largest and most effective in the nation. R. J. Reynolds and Lorillard Tobacco sued over California&#x27;s antismoking campaign but their lawsuit was dismissed in July 2003. Davis also authorized a new hard-hitting anti-smoking ad that graphically depicts the damage caused by secondhand smoke.

In September 2002, Governor Davis signed bills to ensure age verification was obtained for cigarettes and other tobacco products sold over the Internet or through the mail, ensured that all state taxes are being fully paid on tobacco purchases and increased the penalty for possessing or purchasing untaxed cigarettes. He also signed legislation to expand smoke-free zones around public buildings.

Davis approved legislation creating a telemarketing do-not-call list in 2003. Under Davis, benefits for injured and unemployed workers increased. The minimum wage increased by $1 to $6.75. Davis backed higher research and development tax credits. He pushed for elimination of the minimum franchise tax paid by new businesses during the first two years of operation.

While Davis&#x27;s record is generally considered pro-environmental due to increases in spending for land acquisition, maintenance of the state&#x27;s park system, signing legislation that attempts to cut greenhouse gas emissions by having automakers produce more efficient vehicles, cutting fees to state parks and opposing offshore drilling, he was criticized for not backing tougher restrictions on timber companies as some environmentalists desired. Under the Davis administration, California purchased for urban parks.

Davis signed the first state law in the US in July 2002 to require automakers to limit auto emissions. The law required the California Air Resources Board to obtain the &quot;maximum feasible&quot; cuts in greenhouse gases emitted by all non-commercial vehicles in 2009 and beyond. Automakers claimed the law would lead smaller and more expensive cars to be sold in California. In 2003, Davis signed legislation aiming to ban junk email.

On March 25, 1999, Davis issued an executive order calling for the removal of MTBE (a toxic gasoline additive) from gasoline sold in the state. In 2001, in order for gas prices to remain reasonable in California while removing MTBE, Davis asked President George W. Bush to order the EPA to grant California a waiver on the federal minimum oxygen requirement. Without a waiver, California would have to import a much larger amount of ethanol per year and gas prices were projected to increase drastically. Bush did not grant the waiver and in 2002, Davis issued an executive order reversing his earlier executive order.

Davis&#x27;s actions when it came to regulating business suggested that Davis was a more moderate governor. He worked to kill a comprehensive bill opposed by banks and insurance companies to protect consumers&#x27; personal financial information. &quot;What you saw in the campaign was what you got,&quot; said UC Berkeley professor Bruce Cain. &quot;He&#x27;s tried to negotiate a course between the different interest groups and keep Democrats on a more centrist, business-oriented track&quot;.

Davis approved $5.3 billion over five years for more than 150 transit and highway projects. One of those projects was construction on the new eastern section of the Bay Bridge. During 1999 and 2000, California spent millions on onetime projects like buying new rail cars and track improvements.

====California electricity crisis====

Soon after taking office, Davis was able to fast-track the first power plant construction in twelve years in April 1999, although the plant did not come on line before the electricity crisis.

According to the subsequent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission&#x27;s investigation and report, numerous energy trading companies, many based in Texas, such as Enron Corporation, illegally restricted their supply to the point where the spikes in power usage would cause blackouts. Rolling blackouts affecting 97,000 customers hit the San Francisco Bay area on June 14, 2000, and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company filed a complaint alleging market manipulation by some energy producers in August 2000. On December 7, 2000, suffering from low supply and idled power plants, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), which manages the California power grid, declared the first statewide Stage 3 power alert, meaning power reserves were below 3 percent. Rolling blackouts were avoided when the state halted two large state and federal water pumps to conserve electricity.
On January 17, 2001, Davis declared a state of emergency in response to the electricity crisis. Speculators, led by Enron Corporation, were collectively making large profits while the state teetered on the edge for weeks and finally suffered rolling blackouts on January 17 and 18. Davis stepped in to buy power at highly unfavorable terms on the open market, since the California power companies were technically bankrupt and had no buying power. California agreed to pay $43 billion for power over the next 20 years. Newspaper publishers sued Davis to force him to make public the details of the energy deal.

During the electricity crisis, the Davis administration implemented a power conservation program that included television ads and financial incentives to reduce energy consumption. These efforts, the fear of rolling blackouts and the increased cost of electricity resulted in a 14.1% reduction in electricity usage from June 2000 to June 2001.

Gray Davis critics often charge that he did not respond properly to the crisis, while his defenders attribute the crisis solely to the corporate accounting scandals and say that Davis did all he could. Some critics on the left, such as Arianna Huffington, alleged that Davis was lulled to inaction by campaign contributions from energy producers. Some of Davis&#x27;s energy advisers were formerly employed by the same energy speculators who made millions from the crisis. In addition, the Democratic-controlled legislature would sometimes push Davis to act decisively by taking over power plants which were known to have been gamed and place them back under control of the utilities. Some conservatives argued that Davis signed overpriced energy contracts, employed incompetent negotiators and refused to allow electricity prices to rise for residences statewide much as they had in San Diego, which they argue could have given Davis more leverage against the energy traders and encouraged more conservation. The electricity crisis is considered one of the major factors that led to Davis&#x27;s recall.

In a speech at UCLA on August 19, 2003, Davis apologized for being slow to act during the energy crisis, but then forcefully attacked the Houston-based energy suppliers: &quot;I inherited the energy deregulation scheme which put us all at the mercy of the big energy producers. We got no help from the Federal government. In fact, when I was fighting Enron and the other energy companies, these same companies were sitting down with Vice President Cheney to draft a national energy strategy.&quot;

When the Enron verdicts were rendered years later, convicting Enron and other companies of market manipulation, Davis responded with the following quote:

 (Skilling&#x27;s conviction was later overturned by the United States Supreme Court in its narrowing of the &quot;honest services&quot; statute.)

On November 13, 2003, shortly before leaving office, Davis officially brought the energy crisis to an end by issuing a proclamation ending the state of emergency he declared on January 17, 2001. The state of emergency allowed the state to buy electricity for the financially strapped utility companies. The emergency authority allowed Davis to order the California Energy Commission to streamline the application process for new power plants. During that time, California issued licenses to 38 new power plants, amounting to 14,365 megawatts of electricity production when completed.

In 2006, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published an article that credited Davis&#x27;s signing of the long-term projects for preventing future blackouts and providing California a cheap supply of energy with the increasing costs of energy.

In March 2003, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission&#x27;s long-awaited report on the so-called &quot;energy crisis&quot; was released. That report substantially vindicated Davis, laying the blame for the energy disruption and raiding of California&#x27;s treasury on deliberate tactics employed by some 25 energy trading companies, most of which were based in Texas. Of the latter, the most notable was Enron, a number of whose principals were subsequently criminally prosecuted for their roles.

====Budget crisis====
During the economic boom years of the Davis administration, the California budget expanded to cover Davis&#x27;s new programs. California&#x27;s low national K-12 education rankings and Davis&#x27;s campaign pledge to help education, along with the large majority that elected Davis to his first term and his early popularity, suggest that a majority of Californians supported increases in education spending during the early part of his first term when California was in budget surplus. Polls also showed that increased spending in education was supported by the California voters. Under the Davis administration, taxes were cut by over $5.1 billion that included a $3.5 billion cut in sales tax and a reduction in the vehicle licensing fees. The cut in sales taxes was mandated due to a 1991 law that required sales taxes to be reduced a quarter percent when budget reserves exceed 4 percent of the state general fund for two straight fiscal years which they did in 1999 and 2000. Davis also vetoed $5.1 billion in appropriations during that span.
While California&#x27;s economy was expanding, California was producing record budget surpluses under Davis even after his tax cuts and new spending. According to the California Department of Finance, California, had a 10% surplus at the end of 1999 and California was projected to have a 4% surplus at the end fiscal year 2000. These surplus monies were left in the treasury. Davis claimed to be cautious with state finances.

The dot-com boom that had been fueling California&#x27;s record tax revenues went bust. California was home to a large number of high tech firms and was largely dependent on state income taxes. State revenues fell while ongoing spending commitments created deficits. Restoring the vehicle licensing fees to pre tax cut levels to close the budget gap and stabilize the state&#x27;s credit rating became unpopular. The beginning shortfall for the 2002-2003 state budget was $23.6 billion. Davis announced that the 2003-2004 budget shortfall would be $34.6 billion while the Legislative Analyst projected a $21.1.

====Relationship with legislature====
Davis, a moderate, had some disagreements with the more liberal Democratic-controlled Legislature. Democrat John L. Burton, the leader of the California State Senate, was Davis&#x27;s chief antagonist.

====Declining popularity====
In May 2001, in the middle of the California electricity crisis, his numbers declined to 42% approval and 49% disapproval. By December 2001, Davis&#x27;s approval ratings spiked up to 51%. His numbers declined back to the May 2001 level and remained about the same over the next year. In April 2003, Davis had a 24% approval rating and 65% disapproval rating. The leading causes of Davis&#x27;s steep decline in popularity (and eventual recall) were the California electricity crisis, which involved a sharp increase in electricity rates and a series of blackouts in 2001, as well as voter discontent with an increase in state car registration taxes.

Davis had tried to maintain a middle-of-the-road approach, but ultimately alienated many of the state&#x27;s liberals who viewed him as too conservative and many conservatives who viewed him as too liberal. Many were upset that in trying to balance the budget, Davis cut spending for schools while increasing spending for prisons. Some critics attributed the proposal to the California Correctional Peace Officers Associations donations to Davis&#x27;s re-election campaign.

===2002 gubernatorial campaign===
Davis began fundraising for his 2002 reelection campaign early in his governorship. Davis raised $13.2 million in 1999 and $14.2 million in 2000, both unprecedented sums at the time so early in an elected term. Davis&#x27;s 1999 and 2000 contributions included contributions from Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Edison International. Davis also received large contributions from labor groups, environmental groups and individuals.

Davis&#x27;s fundraising efforts attracted much attention. University of California Berkeley&#x27;s Institute of Government Studies claimed that Davis&#x27;s fundraising skills were &quot;second to none in the political arena&quot; while Senator John McCain called Davis&#x27;s 2001 goal of $26 million &quot;disgraceful.&quot; One article in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; claimed that Davis was raising $34,000 a day. Although Davis&#x27;s fundraising pace was criticized by his many detractors, Arnold Schwarzenegger would later collect contributions at a quicker rate during the early years of his governorship. Arnoldwatch.org, a project of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, which is a nonpartisan organization that is critical of both Democrats and Republicans, called Davis a &quot;pay to play&quot; politician and a &quot;sellout&quot;.

During the 2002 election campaign, Davis took the unusual step of taking out campaign ads during the Republican primaries against Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan. Davis claimed that Riordan had attacked his record and that his campaign was defending his record. Polls showed that, as a moderate, Riordan would be a more formidable challenger in the general election than a conservative candidate. Polls even showed that Riordan would defeat Davis. Davis attacked Riordian with negative ads in the primary. The ads questioned Riordan&#x27;s pro-choice stance by questioning Riordan&#x27;s support of pro-life politicians and judges. The ads pointed out Riordan&#x27;s position of wanting a moratorium on the death penalty as being to the left of Gray Davis, who strongly supported it.

Davis&#x27;s negative ads against Riordan and a variety of other equally important factors explained on the 2002 election page, led to Riordan&#x27;s defeat in the Republican primary by the more staunchly conservative candidate Bill Simon. In the first 10 weeks of 2002, Davis spent $10 million on ads: $3 million on positive ads boasting of his record, $7 million on negative ads against Riordan.

Davis was re-elected in the November 2002 general election following a long and bitter campaign against Simon, marked by accusations of ethical lapses on both sides and widespread voter apathy. Simon was also hurt by a financial fraud scandal that tarnished Simon&#x27;s reputation. Davis&#x27;s campaign touted California&#x27;s improving test scores, environmental protection, health insurance coverage for children and lower prescription drug costs for seniors. Davis&#x27;s campaign featured several negative ads that highlighted Simon&#x27;s financial fraud scandal. The 2002 gubernatorial race was the most expensive in California state history with over $100 million spent. Davis&#x27;s campaign was better financed; Davis had over $26 million more in campaign reserves than Simon in August 2002. Davis gained re-election with 47.4% of the vote to Simon&#x27;s 42.4%. However, the Simon-Davis race led in the lowest turnout percentage in modern gubernatorial history, allowing a lower than normal number of signatures required for a recall. Davis won the election, but the majority of voters disliked Davis and did not approve of his job performance.

===Second term===
Davis&#x27;s second term, which lasted only ten months, was dominated by the recall election. He was widely criticized for responding to the budget crisis by reversing a decade of fee reductions on motor vehicles, a decision which his opponents repeatedly referenced. Not long after Davis signed a law allowing the Department of Motor Vehicles to grant driver&#x27;s licenses to undocumented immigrants, he was challenged to a recall election. Davis had also signed legislation requiring employers to pay for medical insurance for workers and legislation granting domestic partners many of the same rights as married people, and vetoed legislation that would have given undocumented immigrants free tuition for community college. Some political observers saw these efforts as an attempt to reinforce support from Hispanics, labor union members and liberal Democrats. Ultimately, Davis did not have as much support from Hispanics and union members in the recall election as he did in his 2002 re-election.

Davis was governor during the southern California fires of 2003, more commonly known as the Cedar Fire. Davis declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles County, San Bernardino County, San Diego County and Ventura County in October 2003 and deployed the National Guard to help with disaster relief. By mid-November, the greater South Los Angeles area had been declared a disaster area. This enabled federal funding to help repair flooding and weather-related damage, including the destruction of thousands of acres of vegetation. The Cedar Fire was the last major event during Davis&#x27;s tenure as governor. Both Davis and governor-elect Schwarzenegger worked to help with disaster relief. Schwarzenegger went to Washington, D.C., and met Vice President Dick Cheney to lobby the federal government for more disaster relief funds.

Davis spent 1,778 days as governor and signed 5,132 bills out of 6,244, vetoing 1,112 bills.

===Recall election===
In July 2003, a sufficient number of citizen signatures were collected for a recall election. The initial drive for the recall was fueled by funds from the personal fortune of U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, a Republican who originally hoped to replace Davis himself. The 2003 California recall special election was the goal of the &quot;Dump Davis&quot; campaign and constituted the first gubernatorial recall in Californian history and only the second in U.S. history. Later, the unsuccessful recall of Scott Walker of Wisconsin in 2012 would be the third and the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election of Gavin Newsom would be the fourth in September 2021.

Early in the runup to the recall election, Davis called the recall election an &quot;insult&quot; to the eight million voters who had voted in the 2002 gubernatorial election. The Davis campaign tried to run against the recall Yes/No vote instead of against the candidates that were trying to replace him. Davis tried to depict the recall as a $66 million waste of money that could allow a candidate with a very small percentage of the vote to become Governor—potentially someone who was very liberal or conservative as there are no primaries in a recall election. Davis tried to run &quot;outside the recall circus&quot; and to make himself appear gubernatorial and hard at work for California, and who had made improvements to education and healthcare. Early August polls showed that over 50% supported the recall.

In September 2003, Davis conceded that he had lost touch with the voters and added that he was holding numerous townhall meetings in an effort to address the problem. Poll numbers in September showed a 3% drop in the number of California voters who were planning to vote yes on the recall. According to some analysts and campaign aides, Davis&#x27;s town hall meetings and conversations with voters were softening his image. Many political insiders remarked that Davis had made several comebacks and that he should not be counted out of the race despite poll numbers that showed over 50% planning to vote yes on the recall.

During the recall, Davis blamed some of the state&#x27;s problems on his predecessor, Pete Wilson. Davis claimed that he would have rather raised taxes on the upper tax brackets instead of restoring vehicle registration fees and college student tuition.

Davis called the recall a right-wing effort to rewrite history after having lost the election during the previous year. In a 19-minute campaign address that was broadcast statewide, Davis called the recall effort a &quot;right-wing power grab&quot; by Republicans. He blamed Republicans in the legislature and in Washington for many of the state&#x27;s problems, while accepting some responsibility for those problems.

On October 7, 2003, Davis was recalled. The recall was supported by 55.4% of voters. Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected to replace Davis as governor. The Bay Area and Los Angeles County were the only regions in California to vote &quot;no&quot; on the recall. Davis is the second governor in the history of the United States to have been recalled; the first was Lynn Frazier of North Dakota in 1921.

On the night of the recall, Davis conceded defeat and thanked California for having elected him in five statewide elections. Davis mentioned what he defined as the accomplishments of his administration such as improvements in education, environmental protection, and health insurance for children. Davis said he would help Schwarzenegger in the transition and he later urged his staff to do the same. His last day in office was November 17, 2003.

==Life after politics==

In December 2004, Davis announced that he was joining the law firm of Loeb &amp; Loeb.

Davis has done several media interviews about his legacy. He appeared prominently in the documentary &quot;&quot;.

The debate about his legacy and role in the energy woes that proved to be his downfall remains. In a CNN interview on August 5, 2005, Davis expressed that he felt vindicated because of the revelation that Enron manipulated the California energy market and because of Schwarzenegger&#x27;s then-low approval ratings. He also indicated that he had no interest in running for governor again, although he had been urged to run by some Democrats.

Davis was a guest lecturer at UCLA&#x27;s School of Public Policy in 2006 alongside former Republican State Senator Jim Brulte. He wrote an introduction for a journalist&#x27;s book on the Amber Alert system for missing children, a cause he championed.

On April 23, 2007, Davis was appointed to the Board of Directors of animation company DiC Entertainment as a non-executive.

On May 21, 2009, Davis was keynote speaker at the Columbia Law School graduation ceremony.

In September 2024, Davis was one of several former governors to sign an open letter to all 50 current governors urging them to certify their states&#x27; votes after the upcoming November election.

==Public image and political views==
Davis&#x27;s moderate record made it difficult for him to appeal to the core constituency of the Democratic Party. During the recall, Davis failed to gain the full support he needed from his more liberal Democratic base. He had a reputation of being beholden to supporters yet unable to satisfy them. Davis&#x27;s leadership and compromise-building skills have also been questioned. He was also hurt by redistricting in 2000 that made most districts safe for the incumbent party, limiting some legislators&#x27; need and willingness to compromise.

When Davis was inaugurated as governor of California, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m a governor, not a judge&quot;. Davis vowed to uphold all of the laws of the state, even the ones with which he personally disagreed. Davis defended Proposition 187 initially, but when it was declared unconstitutional by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, he did not appeal the decision.

Davis&#x27;s personality was often described as aloof and his political style cautious and calculated instead of charismatic. His personality forced him to depend more on political skills, such as fundraising, to win elections. Davis&#x27;s tendency to micromanage his administration made it difficult for people to present opposing views and even drove some out of service.

As Davis left office in 2003, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; published an editorial discussing his legacy. The newspaper claimed that he lacked vision, allowed the legislature and its policies to define his tenure and had a &quot;robotic governing style&quot; that focused on fundraising instead of personal relationships. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; commented that Davis was often on the right side of the issues but that being on the right side of the issues alienated the electorate. Davis lacked charisma and seemed to be more passionate about winning campaigns than governing. Davis never showed emotion to the voters. He spent much of his campaign time talking about his accomplishments instead of providing voters with a vision.

==Personal life==
Davis met his wife-to-be, Sharon Ryer, while on an airplane tending to official business in 1978. Davis and Ryer married in 1983, with California Supreme Court Justice Rose Bird officiating.

<text>Frankfurt (Oder), also known as Frankfurt an der Oder (, ; Central Marchian: &quot;Frankfort an de Oder,&quot; ) is the fourth-largest city in the German state of Brandenburg after Potsdam, Cottbus and Brandenburg an der Havel. With around 58,000 inhabitants, it is the largest German city on the Oder River, and one of the easternmost cities in Germany. Frankfurt sits on the western bank of the Oder, opposite the Polish town of Słubice, which was a part of Frankfurt until 1945, and called &quot;Dammvorstadt&quot; until then. The city is about east of Berlin, in the south of the historical region Lubusz Land. Within Frankfurt&#x27;s city limits lies the recreational area Lake Helenesee.

The name of the city makes reference to the Franks, and means &quot;Ford of the Franks&quot;, and there appears a Gallic rooster in the coats of arms of Frankfurt and Słubice. The official name &quot;Frankfurt (Oder)&quot; and the older &quot;Frankfurt an der Oder&quot; are used to distinguish it from the larger city of Frankfurt am Main.

The city&#x27;s recorded history began in the 13th century as a West Slavic settlement. During its history, it was successively part of the Kingdom of Poland, the Margraviate of Brandenburg, the Bohemian Crown, Prussia and Germany. After World War II, the eastern part of Frankfurt became again part of Poland under the terms of the Potsdam Agreement and was renamed to Słubice, while the western part of Frankfurt became a border city of the German Democratic Republic in 1949.

During the communist era, Frankfurt reached a population peak with more than 87,000 inhabitants at the end of the 1980s. Following German reunification, the population decreased significantly, but has stabilized in recent years at about 58,000 inhabitants. As of 2020, the city plays an important role in German–Polish relations and European integration. Frankfurt is home to the European University Viadrina, which has a campus in Słubice, the Collegium Polonicum.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

Prior to 1249, a West Slavic settlement named Zliwitz along with the Lubusz Land was part of the Kingdom of Poland. The Piast duke Henry the Bearded granted Zliwitz staple rights in 1225. In 1226, construction of the St. Nicholas Church (today&#x27;s &quot;Friedenskirche&quot;) began. In 1249, the settlement became part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg.

The town of Frankfurt received its charter in 1253 at the Brandendamm. The early settlers lived on the western banks of the Oder; later the town was extended to the eastern bank. After a war broke out over control of the region in 1319, the town came under the control of the Duchy of Pomerania. In 1319, Wartislaw IV, Duke of Pomerania, granted new privileges to the town. The town fell again to Brandenburg in 1324. In the Late Middle Ages, the town dominated the river trade between Wrocław and Szczecin. From 1373 to 1415, along with Brandenburg, it was part of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown. In 1430, Frankfurt joined the Hanseatic League. In 1432, the Czech Hussites captured the town.

===Modern era===

In the 16th century, many Polish exports, including grain, wood, ash, tar and hemp, were floated from western Poland via Frankfurt to the port of Szczecin, with the high Brandenburgian customs duties on Polish goods lowered in the early 17th century.

In April 1631, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Frankfurt was the site of the Battle of Frankfurt an der Oder between the Swedish Empire and the Holy Roman Empire. After a two-day siege, Swedish forces, supported by Scottish auxiliaries, stormed the town and destroyed many buildings, e.g. the Georgen Hospital. The result was a Swedish victory. By the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town&#x27;s population had decreased from 12,000 inhabitants to 2,366 inhabitants.
In the 16th century the oldest church of the town (today&#x27;s &quot;Friedenskirche&quot;) was secularized and was even used as a granary, and from the 17th century it served as the church of the French Huguenots.

The city was briefly occupied by the Russian Imperial Army during the Seven Years&#x27; War, in August 1759, in the prelude to the battle of Kunersdorf.

With the dissolution of the Margraviate of Brandenburg during the Napoleonic Wars, Frankfurt became part of the Province of Brandenburg in 1815. In the 19th century, Frankfurt played an important role in trade. Centrally positioned in the Kingdom of Prussia between Berlin and Posen (Poznań), on the river Oder with its heavy traffic, the town housed the second-largest annual trade fair (&quot;Messe&quot;) of the German Reich, surpassed only by that in Leipzig. One of the main escape routes for insurgents of the unsuccessful Polish November Uprising from partitioned Poland to the Great Emigration led through the city. In 1842, the Berlin–Frankfurt (Oder) railway was opened.

===World War II and recent history===
The SS &quot;Einsatzgruppe VI&quot; was formed in the town before it entered several Polish cities, including Poznań, Kalisz and Leszno, to commit various crimes against Poles during the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II. During World War II the Germans brought numerous forced laborers, both men and women, from Poland and the Soviet Union to the town. In early 1945, death marches of prisoners of various nationalities from the dissolved camps in Żabikowo and Świecko to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp passed through the city. There was no fighting for the town in 1945 during World War II even though the town was declared a fortress (&quot;Festung&quot;) in an attempt to block the Red Army&#x27;s route to Berlin. The nearly empty town was burned down by the Red Army. The postwar East German–Polish border ran along the Oder, separating the &quot;Dammvorstadt&quot; on the eastern bank – which became the Polish town of Słubice – from the rest of Frankfurt. While part of communist East Germany, Frankfurt was administered within Bezirk Frankfurt (Oder). It became part of the reconstituted state of Brandenburg with German reunification in 1990.

In the post-communist era, following the collapse of its main employer VEB Halbleiterwerk, Frankfurt has suffered from high unemployment and low economic growth. Its population has fallen significantly from around 87,000 at the time of German reunification in 1990. The only remnant of semiconductor technology industries in Frankfurt by 2003 was the Innovations for High Performance Microelectronics (IHPM) institute.

Today, the towns of Frankfurt and Słubice have friendly relations and run several common projects and facilities. Poland joined the European Union on 1 May 2004, and implemented the Schengen Agreement on 21 December 2007 leading to the removal of permanent border controls.

In March 2008, the Jewish community of Frankfurt celebrated its first Torah dedication since the Holocaust. The procession of the new Torah scroll began from the spot where the town&#x27;s Frankfurter Synagogue stood prior to World War II, 500 meters from Germany&#x27;s current border with Poland. Celebrants marched with the scroll into the town&#x27;s Chabad-Lubavitch centre, where they danced with the Torah, which had been donated by members of the Chabad-Lubavitch community in Berlin.

== Demography ==

==European university==

The Margraviate of Brandenburg&#x27;s first university was Frankfurt&#x27;s Alma Mater Viadrina, founded in 1506 by Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg. An early chancellor, Bishop Georg von Blumenthal (1490–1550), was a notable opponent of the Protestant Reformation, as he remained a Catholic. Frankfurt also trained the noted archbishop Albert of Brandenburg around 1510, who also became a vocal opponent of the Reformation. The university was closed in 1811, and its assets divided between two new universities founded under King Frederick William III: Frederick William University of Berlin, presently Humboldt University; and the Silesian Frederick William University in Breslau, presently the University of Wrocław.

The university was refounded in 1991 with a European emphasis as the Viadrina European University, in close cooperation with the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań; they jointly run the Collegium Polonicum in Słubice.

== Transport ==

The Frankfurt (Oder) Bahnhof is a station served by the Berlin-Warszawa-Express and has regular regional connections to Magdeburg and Cottbus. Within the city, there is a network of five tram lines.

==Sport==

1. FC Frankfurt is the town&#x27;s local football team.

==International relations==
Frankfurt (Oder), being located on the border to Poland, plays a special role in connection with German–Polish relations and European integration. The European University Viadrina has one of its buildings in Poland, in the neighbouring town of Słubice. The university also has a number of projects and initiatives dedicated to bringing Poland and Germany together, and offers its students pro bono Polish courses.

Another project that contributes to German–Polish integration in Frankfurt (Oder) is the Fforst House, a German-Polish student project, which has been granted support by the town&#x27;s administration and by the Viadrina, having been described by the former president of the university, Gesine Schwan, as the place where &quot;Europe begins&quot;.

<text>William Edward Simon Jr. (born June 20, 1951) is an American banker, businessman, and politician. In 2002, Simon campaigned unsuccessfully for Governor of California as a Republican against Democratic incumbent Gray Davis. Billed as a &quot;conservative Republican,&quot; the virtually unknown Simon&#x27;s campaign was significantly boosted by support from better-known Republican officeholders from outside California, including former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and President George W. Bush.

==Background==
Simon was born in Neptune, New Jersey, the son of Carol (Girard) and William E. Simon Sr., the 63rd Secretary of the Treasury under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. Simon Sr., also served as director of the Federal Energy Office. Coincidentally, Simon was a childhood friend of former Democratic party chair Howard Dean.

Simon earned a BA from Williams College in 1973, and a JD from Boston College in 1982. At Boston College Law School, &quot;Billy&quot; Simon was widely popular and respected. He was a Moot Court Champion and represented the school in national moot court competitions. From 1986 to 1988, Simon served as Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, working under then-U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani.

In 1988, Simon co-founded William E. Simon &amp; Sons, a global merchant bank, with his father and brother. Simon managed the family business (which has over $3 billion in assets), as the Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and as a trustee for The Heritage Foundation. Simon also chairs the William E. Simon Foundation. Simon has contributed some of his personal resources to assist less fortunate youths through educational scholarships and beautification of California schools.

==2002 California gubernatorial election==
=== Primary ===
Simon won the Republican nomination in the primary election of March 2002. Some credit Simon&#x27;s primary win to incumbent Governor Gray Davis&#x27; preemptive campaign against Simon&#x27;s major primary opponent, former Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan, a moderate Republican, whom Davis considered a more formidable opponent. At the beginning of the campaign Riordan had higher name recognition and popularity than any other gubernatorial candidate. In fact Riordan began attacking Davis early on in the primaries, as if he already had the GOP nomination, which is what prompted the counter-attack, according to Garry South, Davis&#x27; campaign manager.

Simon&#x27;s come-from-behind win reflected both the GOP&#x27;s dissatisfaction with Riordan&#x27;s inability to appeal to the GOP base (he had publicly insulted George Deukmejian, California&#x27;s most popular Republican governor since Ronald Reagan, and it was revealed that he had supported Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein with campaign contributions) and support for Simon&#x27;s straight-conservative image. Both Riordan and Simon are Roman Catholics and Knights of Malta, with Riordan pro-choice on abortion and Simon pro-life.

Simon polled 1,129,973 primary votes (49.4 percent) to Riordan&#x27;s 715,768 (31.3 percent). Another 387,237 ballots (16.9 percent) were cast for Bill Jones, then the California secretary of state.

=== General ===
Davis&#x27;s campaign advertisements made heavy use of scandals relating to alleged mismanagement of Simon&#x27;s business and charities, though one of the major court rulings unfavorable to Simon was since overturned.

Simon&#x27;s campaign centered largely on allegations of corruption in the incumbent&#x27;s administration, and Davis&#x27;s handling of the 2001 energy crisis.

Immediately after the gubernatorial debate against Gray Davis, Simon accused Davis of receiving campaign funds in the Lt. Governor&#x27;s office, a felony. Simon distributed a photo of Davis being handed a check and insisted that the picture was taken in the Lt. Governor&#x27;s office in the State capitol. Within an hour of its release the location in the picture was determined to have no resemblance to the Lt. Governor&#x27;s office, and within a few days the location was identified as Bruce Karatz&#x27;s home in Southern California.

Despite Davis&#x27;s high disapproval ratings, he managed to defeat Simon by a margin of 47.3% of the vote to Simon&#x27;s 42.4%.

==After gubernatorial campaign==
When the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election became a reality, Simon announced he would once again be a candidate for California Governor but ran for only a short time after he qualified for the ballot before withdrawing from the race on August 23, 2003.

He said, &quot;There are too many Republicans in this race and the people of our state simply cannot risk a continuation of the Gray Davis legacy.&quot; Simon did not endorse any candidates until several weeks later, when he endorsed front-runner Arnold Schwarzenegger. Despite dropping out, his name still appeared in the ballot, and he placed 12th in a field of 135 candidates.

Simon spent most of 2004 and 2005 preparing to run for California state treasurer in 2006, and although he was the clear front-runner for the Republican nomination, he dropped out in October 2005 citing the need to devote more time and attention to his family and four children. He is currently married to Cindy Simon, and together they have three children, Willie, Lindsay, and Griffith. They live in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, and have a vacation home on Maui and one in Sun Valley, Idaho. He also has a daughter, Cary, from his first marriage.

=== Giuliani campaign ===
On February 26, 2007, he was appointed as the Director of Policy for the Rudy Giuliani presidential exploratory committee. Simon was the most influential member of the Giuliani campaign, and was referred to many times as Giuliani&#x27;s &quot;Professor.&quot; The campaign was unsuccessful and Giuliani was one of the first candidates to exit the race.

<text>Perfume (, ) is a mixture of fragrant essential oils or aroma compounds (fragrances), fixatives and solvents, usually in liquid form, used to give the human body, animals, food, objects, and living-spaces an agreeable scent. Perfumes can be defined as substances that emit and diffuse a pleasant and fragrant odor. They consist of manmade mixtures of aromatic chemicals and essential oils. The 1939 Nobel Laureate for Chemistry, Leopold Ružička stated in 1945 that &quot;right from the earliest days of scientific chemistry up to the present time, perfumes have substantially contributed to the development of organic chemistry as regards methods, systematic classification, and theory.&quot;

Ancient texts and archaeological excavations show the use of perfumes in some of the earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as vanillin or coumarin, which allowed for the composition of perfumes with smells previously unattainable solely from natural aromatics.

==History==

The word &quot;perfume&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;perfumare&quot;, meaning &quot;to smoke through&quot;. Perfumery, as the art of making perfumes, began in ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley civilization and possibly Ancient China. It was further refined by the Romans and the Muslims.

One of the world&#x27;s first-recorded chemists is considered to be a woman named Tapputi, a perfume maker mentioned in a cuneiform tablet from the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamia. She distilled flowers, oil, and calamus with other aromatics, then filtered and put them back in the still several times.

On the Indian subcontinent, perfume and perfumery existed in the Indus civilization (3300 BC – 1300 BC).

In 2003, archaeologists uncovered what are believed to be the world&#x27;s oldest surviving perfumes in Pyrgos, Cyprus. The perfumes dated back more than 4,000 years. They were discovered in an ancient perfumery, a factory housing at least 60 stills, mixing bowls, funnels, and perfume bottles. In ancient times people used herbs and spices, such as almond, coriander, myrtle, conifer resin, and bergamot, as well as flowers. In May 2018, an ancient perfume &quot;Rodo&quot; (Rose) was recreated for the Greek National Archaeological Museum&#x27;s anniversary show &quot;Countless Aspects of Beauty&quot;, allowing visitors to approach antiquity through their olfaction receptors. Romans and Greek extracted perfumes from diverse sources such as flowers, woods, seeds, roots, saps, gums. A temple to Athena in Elis, near Olympia, was said to have saffron blended into its wall plaster, allowing the interior to remain fragrant for 500 years.

In the 9th century the Arab chemist Al-Kindi (Alkindus) wrote the &quot;Book of the Chemistry of Perfume and Distillations&quot;, which contained more than a hundred recipes for fragrant oils, salves, aromatic waters, and substitutes or imitations of costly drugs. The book also described 107 methods and recipes for perfume-making and perfume-making equipment, such as the alembic (which still bears its Arabic name. [from Greek ἄμβιξ, &quot;cup&quot;, &quot;beaker&quot;] described by Synesius in the 4th century).

The Persian chemist Ibn Sina (also known as Avicenna) introduced the process of extracting oils from flowers by means of distillation, the procedure most commonly used today. He first experimented with the rose. Until his discovery, liquid perfumes consisted of mixtures of oil and crushed herbs or petals, which made a strong blend. Rose water was more delicate, and immediately became popular. Both the raw ingredients and the distillation technology significantly influenced western perfumery and scientific developments, particularly chemistry.

There is a controversy on whether perfumery was completely lost in Western Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. That said, the art of perfumery in Western Europe was reinvigorated after the Islamic invasion of Spain and Southern Italy in 711 and 827. The Islamic controlled cities of Spain (Al-Andalus) became major producers of perfumes that were traded throughout the Old World. Like in the ancient world, Andalusians used fragrance in devotion to God. Perfumes added a layer of cleanliness that was needed for their devotion. Andalusian women were also offered greater freedoms than women in other Muslim controlled regions and were allowed to leave their homes and socialize outside. This freedom allowed courtship to occur outside of the home. As a result, Andalusian women used perfumes for courtship.

Recipes of perfumes from the monks of Santa Maria Delle Vigne or Santa Maria Novella of Florence, Italy, were recorded from 1221. In the east, the Hungarians produced around 1370 a perfume made of scented oils blended in an alcohol solution – best known as Hungary Water – at the behest of Queen Elizabeth of Hungary. The art of perfumery prospered in Renaissance Italy, and in the 16th century the personal perfumer to Catherine de&#x27; Medici (1519–1589), René the Florentine (Renato il fiorentino), took Italian refinements to France. His laboratory was connected with her apartments by a secret passageway, so that no formulae could be stolen en route. Thanks to Rene, France quickly became one of the European centers of perfume and cosmetics manufacture. Cultivation of flowers for their perfume essence, which had begun in the 14th century, grew into a major industry in the south of France.

Between the 16th and 17th centuries, perfumes were used primarily by the wealthy to mask body odors resulting from infrequent bathing. In 1693, Italian barber Giovanni Paolo Feminis created a perfume water called Aqua Admirabilis, today best known as eau de cologne; his nephew Johann Maria Farina (Giovanni Maria Farina) took over the business in 1732.

By the 18th century the Grasse region of France, Sicily, and Calabria (in Italy) were growing aromatic plants to provide the growing perfume industry with raw materials. Even today, Italy and France remain the center of European perfume design and trade.

==Dilution classes and terminologies==
Perfume types reflect the concentration of aromatic compounds in a solvent, which in fine fragrance is typically ethanol or a mix of water and ethanol. Various sources differ considerably in the definitions of perfume types. The intensity and longevity of a fragrance is based on the concentration, intensity, and longevity of the aromatic compounds, or perfume oils, used. As the percentage of aromatic compounds increases, so does the intensity and longevity of the scent. Specific terms are used to describe a fragrance&#x27;s approximate concentration by the percent of perfume oil in the volume of the final product. The most widespread terms are:
* Parfum or Extrait (P): 15–40% aromatic compounds (IFRA: typically ~20%). In English, parfum is also known as perfume extract, pure perfume, or simply perfume.
* Esprit de parfum (ESdP): 15–30% aromatic compounds, a seldom used strength concentration between EdP and parfum.
* Eau de parfum (EdP) or Parfum de toilette (PdT): 10–20% aromatic compounds (typically ~15%). It is sometimes called &quot;eau de perfume&quot; or &quot;millésime.&quot; Parfum de toilette is a less common term, most popular in the 1980s, that is generally analogous to eau de parfum.
* Eau de toilette (EdT): 5–15% aromatic compounds (typically ~10%). This is the staple for most masculine perfumes.
* Eau de cologne (EdC): 3–8% aromatic compounds (typically ~5%). This concentration is often simply called cologne.
* Eau fraîche: 3% or less aromatic compounds. This general term encompasses products sold as &quot;splashes,&quot; &quot;mists,&quot; &quot;veils&quot; and other imprecise terms. Such products may be diluted with water rather than oil or alcohol.

===Imprecise terminology===

The wide range in the percentages of aromatic compounds that may be present in each concentration means that the terminology of extrait, EdP, EdT, and EdC is quite imprecise with regard to oil concentration. Although an EdP will often be more concentrated than an EdT and in turn an EdC, this is not always the case. Different perfumeries or perfume houses assign different amounts of oils to each of their perfumes. Therefore, although the oil concentration of a perfume in EdP dilution will necessarily be higher than the same perfume in EdT from within a company&#x27;s same range, the actual amount will vary among companies. An EdT from one house may have a higher concentration of aromatic compounds than an EdP from another.

Furthermore, some fragrances with the same &quot;product name&quot; but having a different &quot;concentration&quot; may not only differ in their dilutions, but actually use different perfume oil mixtures altogether. For instance, in order to make the EdT version of a fragrance brighter and fresher than its EdP, the EdT oil may be &quot;tweaked&quot; to contain slightly more top notes or fewer base notes. &quot;Chanel No. 5&quot; is a good example: its parfum, EdP, EdT, and now-discontinued EdC concentrations are in fact different compositions (the parfum dates to 1921, the EdT from the 1950s, and the EdP was not developed until the 1980s). In some cases, words such as &quot;extrême&quot;, &quot;intense&quot;, or &quot;concentrée&quot; that might indicate a higher aromatic concentration are actually completely different fragrances, related only because of a similar perfume &quot;accord&quot;. An example of this is Chanel&#x27;s &quot;Pour Monsieur&quot; and &quot;Pour Monsieur concentrée&quot;. This complexity adds a layer of nuance to the understanding and appreciation of perfumery, where variations in concentration and formulation can significantly alter the olfactory (&quot;the sense of smell&quot;) experience.

=== History of the terms and concentrations ===
The terms &quot;perfume&quot; and &quot;cologne&quot; lead to much confusion in English. &quot;Perfume&quot; is often used as a generic, overarching term to refer to fragrances marketed to women, regardless of their exact concentration. The term &quot;cologne&quot; is applied to those sold to men. The actual product worn by a woman may be an eau de parfum rather than an extrait, or by a man an eau de toilette rather than an eau de cologne. The reasons why the terms &quot;perfume&quot; and &quot;cologne&quot; are often used in a generic sense is related to the modern development of perfumery in Europe since the 18th century.

The term &quot;cologne&quot; was first used in Europe in the 18th century to refer to a family of fresh, citrus-based fragrances distilled using extracts from citrus, floral, and woody ingredients. These &quot;classical colognes&quot; were supposedly first developed in Cologne, Germany, hence the name. This type of cologne, which is still in production, describes unisex compositions &quot;which are basically citrus blends and do not have a perfume parent.&quot; Examples include Mäurer &amp; Wirtz&#x27;s &quot;4711&quot; (created in 1799), and Guerlain&#x27;s &quot;Eau de Cologne Impériale&quot; (1830). &quot;Toilet water,&quot; or eau de toilette, referred to wide range of scented waters not otherwise known as colognes, and were popular throughout the 19th century.

The term &quot;perfume&quot; emerged in the late 19th century. The first fragrance labeled a &quot;parfum&quot; extract with a high concentration of aromatic compounds was Guerlain&#x27;s &quot;Jicky&quot; in 1889. In the first half of the 20th century, fragrance companies began offering their products in more than one concentration, often pairing an extrait with a lighter eau de toilette suitable for day wear, which made their products available to a wider range of customers. As this process accelerated, perfume houses borrowed the term &quot;cologne&quot; to refer to an even more diluted interpretation of their fragrances than eau de toilette. Guerlain, for example, offered an eau de cologne version of its flagship perfume &quot;Shalimar&quot; and many of its other fragrances. In contrast to a classical eau de cologne, this type of modern cologne is a lighter, less concentrated interpretation of a more concentrated product, typically a pure parfum, and is usually the lightest concentration from a line of fragrance products.

The eau de parfum concentration and terminology is the most recent, being originally developed to offer the radiance of an EdT with the longevity of an extrait. Parfum de toilette and EdP began to appear in the 1970s and gained popularity in the 1980s. In the 21st century, EdP is probably the most widespread strength concentration. It is often the first concentration offered when a new fragrance is launched, and usually referred to generically as &quot;perfume.&quot;

Historically, women&#x27;s fragrances tended to have higher levels of aromatic compounds than men&#x27;s fragrances. Fragrances marketed to men were typically sold as EdT or EdC, rarely as EdP or perfume extracts. This is changing in the modern fragrance world, especially as fragrances are becoming more unisex. Women&#x27;s fragrances used to be common in all levels of concentration, but in the 21st century are mainly seen in EdP and EdT concentrations. Many modern perfumes are never offered in extrait or eau de cologne formulations, and EdP and EdT account for the vast majority of new launches.

===Solvent types===
Perfume oils are often diluted with a solvent, though this is not always the case, and its necessity is disputed. By far the most common solvent for perfume-oil dilution is alcohol, typically a mixture of ethanol and water or a rectified spirit. Perfume oil can also be diluted by means of neutral-smelling oils such as fractionated coconut oil, or liquid waxes such as jojoba oil and almond oil.

===Applying fragrances===
The conventional application of pure perfume (parfum extrait) in Western cultures is behind the ears, at the nape of the neck, under the armpits and at the insides of wrists, elbows and knees, so that the pulse point will warm the perfume and release fragrance continuously. According to perfumer Sophia Grojsman behind the knees is the ideal point to apply perfume in order that the scent may rise. The modern perfume industry encourages the practice of layering fragrance so that it is released in different intensities depending upon the time of the day. Lightly scented products such as bath oil, shower gel, and body lotion are recommended for the morning; eau de toilette is suggested for the afternoon; and perfume applied to the pulse points for evening. Cologne fragrance is released rapidly, lasting around 2 hours. Eau de toilette lasts from 2 to 4 hours, while perfume may last up to six hours.

A variety of factors can influence how fragrance interacts with the wearer&#x27;s own physiology and affect the perception of the fragrance. Diet is one factor, as eating spicy and fatty foods can increase the intensity of a fragrance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fragrance Info / FAQs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The use of medications can also impact the character of a fragrance. The relative dryness of the wearer&#x27;s skin is important, since dry skin will not hold fragrance as long as skin with more oil.

==Describing a perfume==


The precise formulae of commercial perfumes are kept secret. Even if they were widely published, they would be dominated by such complex ingredients and odorants that they would be of little use in providing a guide to the general consumer in description of the &quot;experience&quot; of a scent. Nonetheless, connoisseurs of perfume can become extremely skillful at identifying components and origins of scents in the same manner as wine experts.

The most practical way to start describing a perfume is according to the elements of the &quot;fragrance notes&quot; of the scent or the &quot;family&quot; it belongs to, all of which affect the overall impression of a perfume from first application to the last lingering hint of scent.

The trail of scent left behind by a person wearing perfume is called its &quot;sillage&quot;, after the French word for &quot;wake&quot;, as in the trail left by a boat in water.

===Fragrance notes===
Perfume is described in a musical metaphor as having three sets of &quot;notes&quot;, making the harmonious scent &quot;accord&quot;. The notes unfold over time, with the immediate impression of the top note leading to the deeper middle notes, and the base notes gradually appearing as the final stage. These notes are created carefully with knowledge of the evaporation process of the perfume.
*Top notes: Also called the head notes. The scents that are perceived immediately on application of a perfume. Top notes consist of small, light molecules that evaporate quickly. They form a person&#x27;s initial impression of a perfume and thus are very important in the selling of a perfume. Examples of top notes include mint, lavender and coriander.
*Middle notes: Also referred to as heart notes. The scent of a perfume that emerges just prior to the dissipation of the top note. The middle note compounds form the &quot;heart&quot; or main body of a perfume and act to mask the often unpleasant initial impression of base notes, which become more pleasant with time. Examples of middle notes include seawater, sandalwood and jasmine.
*Base notes: The scent of a perfume that appears close to the departure of the middle notes. The base and middle notes together are the main theme of a perfume. Base notes bring depth and solidity to a perfume. Compounds of this class of scents are typically rich and &quot;deep&quot; and are usually not perceived until 30 minutes after application. Examples of base notes include tobacco, amber and musk.
The scents in the top and middle notes are influenced by the base notes; conversely, the scents of the base notes will be altered by the types of fragrance materials used as middle notes. Manufacturers who publish perfume notes typically do so with the fragrance components presented as a &quot;fragrance pyramid&quot;, using imaginative and abstract terms for the components listed.

===Olfactive families===
The grouping of perfumes can never be completely objective or definitive. Many fragrances contain aspects of different families. Even a perfume designated as &quot;single flower&quot; will have subtle undertones of other aromatics. There are hardly any true unitary-scent perfumes consisting of a single aromatic material.

The family classification is a starting point to describe a perfume, but does not fully characterize it.

====Traditional categories====
The traditional categories which emerged around 1900:

* Citrus: The oldest fragrance family that gave birth to lightweight eau de colognes. Development of newer fragrance compounds has allowed for the creation of more tenacious citrus fragrances. Examples: &quot;4711&quot;, Guerlain&#x27;s &quot;Eau de Cologne Impériale&quot;, Penhaligon&#x27;s &quot;Quercus&quot;.
*Single Floral: Fragrances dominated by the scent of a particular flower, i.e., rose, carnation, iris. In French this type of fragrance is called a &quot;soliflore&quot;. Example: Serge Lutens &quot;Sa Majeste La Rose&quot;.
*Floral Bouquet: Compound of several flower scents. Examples: Houbigant &quot;Quelques Fleurs&quot;, Jean Patou &quot;Joy&quot;.
*Amber or &quot;Oriental&quot;: Large class featuring sweet, slightly animalic scents of ambergris or labdanum, often combined with vanilla, tonka bean, flowers and woods. Can be enhanced by camphorous oils and incense resins, evoking Victorian era &quot;Oriental&quot; imagery. Traditional examples: Guerlain &quot;Shalimar&quot;, Yves Saint Laurent &quot;Opium&quot;, Chanel &quot;Coco Mademoiselle&quot;.
*Woody: Fragrances dominated by woody notes, typically agarwood, sandalwood, cedarwood, and vetiver. Patchouli, with its camphoraceous smell, is commonly found in these perfumes. Traditional examples: Myrurgia &quot;Maderas De Oriente&quot;, Chanel &quot;Bois des Îles.&quot; Modern: Balenciaga &quot;Rumba&quot;.
*Leather: A family of fragrances featuring honey, tobacco, wood and wood tars in the middle or base notes and a scent that alludes to leather. Traditional examples: Robert Piguet &quot;Bandit&quot;, Balmain &quot;Jolie Madame&quot;.
*Chypre (): Meaning &quot;Cyprus&quot; in French, this category is named after the François Coty&#x27;s &quot;Chypre&quot; (1917), which was the first modern fragrance built on an accord of bergamot, oakmoss, and labdanum. Example: Guerlain &quot;Mitsouko&quot;, Rochas &quot;Femme&quot;.
* (): Meaning &quot;fern&quot; in French, built on a base of lavender, coumarin and oakmoss, with a sharp herbaceous and woody scent. Named for Houbigant&#x27;s landmark fragrance &quot;Fougère Royale&quot;, many men&#x27;s fragrances belong to this family. Modern examples: Fabergé &quot;Brut&quot;, Guy Laroche &quot;Drakkar Noir,&quot; Penhaligon&#x27;s &quot;Douro&quot;.

====Modern====
Since 1945, new categories have emerged to describe modern scents, due to great advances in the technology of compound design and synthesis, as well as the natural development of styles and tastes:

*Bright Floral: Combining single floral and floral bouquet traditional categories. Example: Estée Lauder &quot;Beautiful&quot;.
*Green: Lighter, more modern interpretation of the Chypre type, with pronounced cut grass, crushed green leaf and cucumber-like scents. Examples: Estée Lauder &quot;Aliage&quot;, Sisley &quot;Eau de Campagne&quot;, Calvin Klein &quot;Eternity&quot;.
*Aquatic, Oceanic, Ozonic: The newest category, first appearing in 1988 Davidoff &quot;Cool Water&quot; (1988), Christian Dior &quot;Dune&quot; (1991). A clean smell reminiscent of the ocean, leading to many androgynous perfumes. Generally contains calone, a synthetic discovered in 1966, or more recent synthetics. Also used to accent floral, oriental, and woody fragrances.
*Fruity: Featuring fruits other than citrus, such as peach, cassis (blackcurrant), mango, passionfruit, and others. Example: Ginestet &quot;Botrytis&quot;.
*Gourmand (): Scents with &quot;edible&quot; or &quot;dessert-like&quot; qualities, often containing vanilla, tonka bean, and coumarin, as well as synthetic components designed to resemble food flavors. Example: Thierry Mugler&#x27;s &quot;Angel&quot;.

====Fragrance wheel====
This newer classification method is widely used in retail and the fragrance industry, created in 1983 by the perfume consultant Michael Edwards. The new scheme simplifies classification and naming, as well as showing the relationships among the classes.

The five main families are &quot;Floral&quot;, &quot;Oriental&quot;, &quot;Woody&quot;, &quot;Aromatic Fougère&quot;, and &quot;Fresh&quot;, the first four from the classic terminology and the last from the modern oceanic category. Each of these are divided into subgroups and arranged around a wheel.
In this scheme, &quot;Chanel No.5&quot;, traditionally classified as an aldehydic floral, is placed under the Soft Floral sub-group, while amber scents are within the Oriental group. Chypre perfumes are more ambiguous, having affinities with both the Oriental and Woody families. For instance, Guerlain &quot;Mitsouko&quot; is under Mossy Woods, but Hermès &quot;Rouge&quot;, a more floral chypre, is under Floral Oriental.

==Aromatics sources==

===Plant sources===


Plants have long been used in perfumery as a source of essential oils and aroma compounds. These aromatics are usually secondary metabolites produced by plants as protection against herbivores, infections, as well as to attract pollinators. Plants are by far the largest source of fragrant compounds used in perfumery. The sources of these compounds may be derived from various parts of a plant. A plant can offer more than one source of aromatics, for instance the aerial portions and seeds of coriander have remarkably different odors from each other. Orange leaves, blossoms, and fruit zest are the respective sources of petitgrain, neroli, and orange oils.
* Bark: Commonly used barks include cinnamon and cascarilla. The fragrant oil in sassafras root bark is also used either directly or purified for its main constituent, safrole, which is used in the synthesis of other fragrant compounds.
* Flowers and blossoms: Undoubtedly the largest and most common source of perfume aromatics. Includes the flowers of several species of rose and jasmine, as well as osmanthus, plumeria, mimosa, tuberose, narcissus, scented geranium, cassie, ambrette as well as the blossoms of citrus and ylang-ylang trees. Although not traditionally thought of as a flower, the unopened flower buds of the clove are also commonly used. Most orchid flowers are not commercially used to produce essential oils or absolutes, except in the case of vanilla, an orchid, which must be pollinated first and made into seed pods before use in perfumery.
* Fruits: Fresh fruits such as apples, strawberries, cherries rarely yield the expected odors when extracted; if such fragrance notes are found in a perfume, they are more likely to be of synthetic origin. Notable exceptions include blackcurrant leaf, litsea cubeba, vanilla, and juniper berry. The most commonly used fruits yield their aromatics from the rind; they include citrus such as oranges, lemons, and limes. Although grapefruit rind is still used for aromatics, more and more commercially used grapefruit aromatics are artificially synthesized since the natural aromatic contains sulfur and its degradation product is quite unpleasant in smell.
* Leaves and twigs: Commonly used for perfumery are lavender leaf, patchouli, sage, violets, rosemary, and citrus leaves. Sometimes leaves are valued for the &quot;green&quot; smell they bring to perfumes, examples of this include hay and tomato leaf.
* Resins: Valued since antiquity, resins have been widely used in incense and perfumery. Highly fragrant and antiseptic resins and resin-containing perfumes have been used by many cultures as medicines for a large variety of ailments. Commonly used resins in perfumery include labdanum, frankincense/olibanum, myrrh, balsam of Peru, benzoin. Pine and fir resins are a particularly valued source of terpenes used in the organic synthesis of many other synthetic or naturally occurring aromatic compounds. Some of what is called amber and copal in perfumery today is the resinous secretion of fossil conifers.
*Roots, rhizomes and bulbs: Commonly used terrestrial portions in perfumery include iris rhizomes, vetiver roots, various rhizomes of the ginger family.
* Seeds: Commonly used seeds include tonka bean, carrot seed, coriander, caraway, cocoa, nutmeg, mace, cardamom, and anise.
* Woods: Highly important in providing the base notes to a perfume, wood oils and distillates are indispensable in perfumery. Commonly used woods include sandalwood, rosewood, agarwood, birch, cedar, juniper, and pine. These are used in the form of macerations or dry-distilled (rectified) forms.
*Rom terpenes. Orchid scents

===Animal sources===
*Ambergris: Lumps of oxidized fatty compounds, whose precursors were secreted and expelled by the sperm whale. Ambergris should not be confused with yellow amber, which is used in jewelry. Because the harvesting of ambergris involves no harm to its animal source, it remains one of the few animalic fragrancing agents around which little controversy now exists.
*Castoreum: Obtained from the odorous sacs of the North American beaver.
*Civet: Also called civet musk, this is obtained from the odorous sacs of the civets, animals in the family &quot;Viverridae&quot;, related to the mongoose. World Animal Protection investigated African civets caught for this purpose.
*Hyraceum: Commonly known as &quot;Africa stone&quot;, is the petrified excrement of the rock hyrax.
*Honeycomb: From the honeycomb of the honeybee. Both beeswax and honey can be solvent extracted to produce an absolute. Beeswax is extracted with ethanol and the ethanol evaporated to produce beeswax absolute.
*Musk: Originally derived from a gland (sac or pod) located between the genitals and the umbilicus of the Himalayan male musk deer Moschus moschiferus, it has now mainly been replaced by the use of synthetic musks sometimes known as &quot;white musk&quot;.

===Other natural sources===
* Lichens: Commonly used lichens include oakmoss and treemoss thalli.
* &quot;Seaweed&quot;: Distillates are sometimes used as essential oil in perfumes. An example of a commonly used seaweed is &quot;Fucus vesiculosus&quot;, which is commonly referred to as bladder wrack. Natural seaweed fragrances are rarely used due to their higher cost and lower potency than synthetics.

===Synthetic sources===

Many modern perfumes contain synthesized odorants. Synthetics can provide fragrances which are not found in nature. For instance, Calone, a compound of synthetic origin, imparts a fresh ozonous metallic marine scent that is widely used in contemporary perfumes. Synthetic aromatics are often used as an alternate source of compounds that are not easily obtained from natural sources. For example, linalool and coumarin are both naturally occurring compounds that can be inexpensively synthesized from terpenes. Orchid scents (typically &quot;salicylates&quot;) are usually not obtained directly from the plant itself but are instead synthetically created to match the fragrant compounds found in various orchids.

One of the most commonly used classes of synthetic aromatics by far are the white musks. These materials are found in all forms of commercial perfumes as a neutral background to the middle notes. These musks are added in large quantities to laundry detergents in order to give washed clothes a lasting &quot;clean&quot; scent.

The majority of the world&#x27;s synthetic aromatics are created by relatively few companies. They include:
* Givaudan
* International Flavors and Fragrances (IFF)
* Firmenich
* Takasago
* Symrise
Each of these companies patents several processes for the production of aromatic synthetics annually.

===Characteristics===
Natural and synthetics are used for their different odor characteristics in perfumery
==Obtaining natural odorants==
Before perfumes can be composed, the odorants used in various perfume compositions must first be obtained. Synthetic odorants are produced through organic synthesis and purified. Odorants from natural sources require the use of various methods to extract the aromatics from the raw materials. The results of the extraction are either essential oils, absolutes, concretes, or butters, depending on the amount of waxes in the extracted product.

All these techniques will, to a certain extent, distort the odor of the aromatic compounds obtained from the raw materials. This is due to the use of heat, harsh solvents, or through exposure to oxygen in the extraction process which will denature the aromatic compounds, which either change their odor character or renders them odorless.
* Maceration/Solvent extraction: The most used and economically important technique for extracting aromatics in the modern perfume industry. Raw materials are submerged in a solvent that can dissolve the desired aromatic compounds. &quot;Maceration&quot; lasts anywhere from hours to months. Fragrant compounds for woody and fibrous plant materials are often obtained in this manner as are all aromatics from animal sources. The technique can also be used to extract odorants that are too volatile for &quot;distillation&quot; or easily denatured by heat. Commonly used solvents for &quot;maceration/solvent extraction&quot; include ethane, hexane, and dimethyl ether. The product of this process is called a &quot;concrete.&quot;
** &quot;Supercritical fluid extraction&quot;: A relatively new technique for extracting fragrant compounds from a raw material, which often employs Supercritical CO2. Due to the low heat of process and the relatively nonreactive solvent used in the extraction, the fragrant compounds derived often closely resemble the original odor of the raw material.
**&quot;Ethanol extraction&quot;: A type of solvent extraction used to extract fragrant compounds directly from dry raw materials, as well as the impure oily compounds materials resulting from solvent extraction or enfleurage. Ethanol extraction from fresh plant materials contain large quantities of water, which will also be extracted into the ethanol.
* Distillation: A common technique for obtaining aromatic compounds from plants, such as orange blossoms and roses. The raw material is heated and the fragrant compounds are re-collected through condensation of the distilled vapor.

** &quot;Steam distillation&quot;: Steam from boiling water is passed through the raw material, which drives out their volatile fragrant compounds. The condensate from distillation are settled in a Florentine flask. This allows for the easy separation of the fragrant oils from the water. The water collected from the condensate, which retains some of the fragrant compounds and oils from the raw material is called hydrosol and sometimes sold. This is most commonly used for fresh plant materials such as flowers, leaves, and stems.
** &quot;Dry/destructive distillation&quot;: The raw materials are directly heated in a still without a carrier solvent such as water. Fragrant compounds that are released from the raw material by the high heat often undergo anhydrous pyrolysis, which results in the formation of different fragrant compounds, and thus different fragrant notes. This method is used to obtain fragrant compounds from fossil amber and fragrant woods where an intentional &quot;burned&quot; or &quot;toasted&quot; odor is desired.
** &quot;Fractionation&quot;: Through the use of a fractionation column, different fractions distilled from a material can be selectively excluded to modify the scent of the final product. Although the product is more expensive, this is sometimes performed to remove unpleasant or undesirable scents of a material and affords the perfumer more control over their composition process.
* Expression: Raw material is squeezed or compressed and the essential oils are collected. Of all raw materials, only the fragrant oils from the peels of fruits in the citrus family are extracted in this manner since the oil is present in large enough quantities as to make this extraction method economically feasible.
* Enfleurage: Absorption of aroma materials into solid fat or wax and then extraction of odorous oils with ethyl alcohol. Extraction by enfleurage was commonly used when distillation was not possible because some fragrant compounds denature through high heat. This technique is not commonly used in the modern industry due to prohibitive costs and the existence of more efficient and effective extraction methods.

==Fragrant extracts==

Although fragrant extracts are known to the general public as the generic term &quot;essential oils&quot;, a more specific language is used in the fragrance industry to describe the source, purity, and technique used to obtain a particular fragrant extract.
Of these extracts, only &quot;absolutes&quot;, &quot;essential oils&quot;, and &quot;tinctures&quot; are directly used to formulate perfumes.
*Absolute: Fragrant materials that are purified from a &quot;pommade&quot; or &quot;concrete&quot; by soaking them in ethanol. By using a slightly hydrophilic compound such as ethanol, most of the fragrant compounds from the waxy source materials can be extracted without dissolving any of the fragrantless waxy molecules. Absolutes are usually found in the form of an oily liquid.
*Concrete: Fragrant materials that have been extracted from raw materials through &quot;solvent extraction&quot; using volatile hydrocarbons. Concretes usually contain a large amount of wax due to the ease in which the solvents dissolve various hydrophobic compounds. As such concretes are usually further purified through distillation or ethanol based solvent extraction. Concretes are typically either waxy or resinous solids or thick oily liquids.
*Essential oil: Fragrant materials that have been extracted from a source material directly through &quot;distillation&quot; or &quot;expression&quot; and obtained in the form of an oily liquid. Oils extracted through expression are sometimes called &quot;expression oils&quot;.
*Pomade: A fragrant mass of solid fat created from the &quot;enfleurage&quot; process, in which odorous compounds in raw materials are adsorbed into animal fats. Pommades are found in the form of an oily and sticky solid.
*Tincture: Fragrant materials produced by directly soaking and infusing raw materials in ethanol. Tinctures are typically thin liquids.

Products from different extraction methods are known under different names even though their starting materials are the same. For instance, orange blossoms from &quot;Citrus aurantium&quot; that have undergone solvent extraction produces &quot;orange blossom absolute&quot; but that which have been steam distilled is known as &quot;neroli oil&quot;.

==Composing perfumes==
Perfume compositions are an important part of many industries ranging from the luxury goods sectors, food services industries, to manufacturers of various household chemicals. The purpose of using perfume or fragrance compositions in these industries is to affect customers through their sense of smell and entice them into purchasing the perfume or perfumed product. As such there is significant interest in producing a perfume formulation that people will find aesthetically pleasing.

===The perfumer===
The job of composing perfumes that will be sold is left up to an expert on perfume composition or known in the fragrance industry as the &quot;perfumer&quot;. They are also sometimes referred to affectionately as a &quot;Nez&quot; (French for &quot;nose&quot;) due to their fine sense of smell and skill in smell composition.

The composition of a perfume typically begins with a &quot;brief&quot; by the perfumer&#x27;s employer or an outside customer. The customers to the perfumer or their employers, are typically fashion houses or large corporations of various industries. The perfumer will then go through the process of blending multiple perfume mixtures and sell the formulation to the customer, often with modifications of the composition of the perfume. 
The perfume composition will then be either used to enhance another product as a &quot;functional fragrance&quot; (shampoos, make-up, detergents, car interiors, etc.), or marketed and sold directly to the public as a &quot;fine fragrance&quot;.

===Technique===

Although there is no single &quot;correct&quot; technique for the formulation of a perfume, there are general guidelines as to how a perfume can be constructed from a concept. Although many ingredients do not contribute to the smell of a perfume, many perfumes include colorants and antioxidants to improve the marketability and shelf life of the perfume, respectively.

====Basic framework====
Perfume oils usually contain tens to hundreds of ingredients and these are typically organized in a perfume for the specific role they will play. These ingredients can be roughly grouped into four groups:
*&quot;Primary scents&quot; (Heart): Can consist of one or a few main ingredients for a certain concept, such as &quot;rose&quot;. Alternatively, multiple ingredients can be used together to create an &quot;abstract&quot; primary scent that does not bear a resemblance to a natural ingredient. For instance, jasmine and rose scents are commonly blends for abstract floral fragrances. Cola flavourant is a good example of an abstract primary scent.
*&quot;Modifiers&quot;: These ingredients alter the primary scent to give the perfume a certain desired character: for instance, fruit esters may be included in a floral primary to create a fruity floral; calone and citrus scents can be added to create a &quot;fresher&quot; floral. The cherry scent in cherry cola can be considered a modifier.
*&quot;Blenders&quot;: A large group of ingredients that smooth out the transitions of a perfume between different &quot;layers&quot; or bases. These themselves can be used as a major component of the primary scent. Common blending ingredients include linalool and hydroxycitronellal.
*&quot;Fixatives&quot;: Used to support the primary scent by bolstering it. Many resins, wood scents, and amber bases are used as fixatives.

The top, middle, and base notes of a fragrance may have separate primary scents and supporting ingredients. The perfume&#x27;s fragrance oils are then blended with ethyl alcohol and water, aged in tanks for several weeks and filtered through processing equipment to, respectively, allow the perfume ingredients in the mixture to stabilize and to remove any sediment and particles before the solution can be filled into the perfume bottles.

====Fragrance bases====

Instead of building a perfume from &quot;ground up&quot;, many modern perfumes and colognes are made using &quot;fragrance bases&quot; or simply bases. Each base is essentially modular perfume that is blended from essential oils and aromatic chemicals, and formulated with a simple concept such as &quot;fresh cut grass&quot; or &quot;juicy sour apple&quot;. Many of Guerlain&#x27;s &quot;Aqua Allegoria&quot; line, with their simple fragrance concepts, are good examples of what perfume fragrance bases are like.

The effort used in developing bases by fragrance companies or individual perfumers may equal that of a marketed perfume, since they are useful in that they are reusable. On top of its reusability, the benefit in using bases for construction are quite numerous:
#Ingredients with &quot;difficult&quot; or &quot;overpowering&quot; scents that are tailored into a blended base may be more easily incorporated into a work of perfume
#A base may be better scent approximations of a certain thing than the extract of the thing itself. For example, a base made to embody the scent for &quot;fresh dewy rose&quot; might be a better approximation for the scent concept of a rose after rain than plain rose oil. Flowers whose scents cannot be extracted, such as gardenia or hyacinth, are composed as bases from data derived from headspace technology.
#A perfumer can quickly rough out a concept from a brief by combining multiple bases, then present it for feedback. Smoothing out the &quot;edges&quot; of the perfume can be done after a positive response.

===Reverse engineering===
Creating perfumes through reverse engineering with analytical techniques such as Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) can reveal the &quot;general&quot; formula for any particular perfume. The difficulty of GC/MS analysis arises due to the complexity of a perfume&#x27;s ingredients. This is particularly due to the presence of natural essential oils and other ingredients consisting of complex chemical mixtures. However, &quot;anyone armed with good GC/MS equipment and experienced in using this equipment can today, within days, find out a great deal about the formulation of any perfume... customers and competitors can analyze most perfumes more or less precisely.&quot;

Antique or badly preserved perfumes undergoing this analysis can also be difficult due to the numerous degradation by-products and impurities that may have resulted from breakdown of the odorous compounds. Ingredients and compounds can usually be ruled out or identified using gas chromatograph (GC) smellers, which allow individual chemical components to be identified both through their physical properties and their scent. Reverse engineering of best-selling perfumes in the market is a very common practice in the fragrance industry due to the relative simplicity of operating GC equipment, the pressure to produce marketable fragrances, and the highly lucrative nature of the perfume market.

===Copyright===

It is doubtful whether perfumes qualify as appropriate copyright subject matter under the US Copyright Act. The issue has not yet been addressed by any US court. A perfume&#x27;s scent is not eligible for trademark protection: the scent serves as the functional purpose of the product.

In 2006 the Dutch Supreme Court granted copyright protection to Lancôme&#x27;s perfume &quot;Tresor&quot; (&quot;Lancôme v. Kecofa&quot;).

The French Supreme Court has twice taken the position that perfumes lack the creativity to constitute copyrightable expressions (&quot;Bsiri-Barbir v. Haarman &amp; Reimer&quot;, 2006; &quot;Beaute Prestige International v. Senteur Mazal&quot;, 2008).

Sometimes, a knock-off perfume would use an altered name of the original perfume (for instance, now-discontinued &quot;Freya&quot; by Oriflame perfume has a similar-designed copy produced as &quot;Freyya&quot;).

It is still questionable if perfume&#x27;s &quot;functional purpose&quot; can be protected with technical patent (one which lasts 15 years). Apparently, Russian &quot;Novaya Zarya&quot; labels their colognes as &quot;hygienic lotions&quot; for a similar reason. A counterexample: NovZar&#x27;s more-than-century-old &quot;Shipr&quot; chypre and Troinoi cologne are being produced by other companies in Russia in similar bottles.

====Numbered perfumery, &quot;analogs&quot;====
A different kind of copying perfumes is known in ex-USSR countries as &quot;номерная парфюмерия&quot; (literally &quot;numbered perfumery&quot;):

A &quot;number-making&quot; company with perfumery equipment would use their own, one-style-for-all cheap bottle; &quot;de jure&quot; labeling a knock-off perfume as an &quot;aroma in the direction of [the well-known perfume]&quot; or a &quot;version&quot; of certain branded perfume. This way, the production costs of initially cheap scents are reduced, since the bottle is used neither for plain counterfeiting nor for subtle re-designing.

The questionable part of numbered perfumery naming is the idea to openly mark perfume #XXX (say, #105) as either &quot;type&quot; or &quot;version&quot;, or &quot;аромат направления&quot; (literally &quot;aroma in the direction of&quot;) of a well-known perfum.
* Resellers in offline stores (in malls, airport shops) can offer &quot;fillable&quot; perfumery, sometimes using weasel wording to justify the price.
* Such perfumes usually get three-digit numbers as an officially registered name, which is stickered to the bottles.
* When it comes to propellant, a &quot;number&quot; usually has an alcohol base [almost] without stabilization (which may give strong &quot;alcohol base stench&quot;, altering perfume&#x27;s scent into the &quot;smell of cheapness&quot; phenomenon).
** To avoid this, many &quot;numbers&quot; can be made with (di)propylenglicol base and come as &quot;perfume oil(s)&quot;. PG or DPG based numbered perfumery comes in 50ml plastic bottles and is purposed for tiny rollers; (D)PG is not usable in spray bottles (while not affected by the &quot;smell of cheapness&quot; issue nonetheless). Some companies offer all of their own &quot;numbers&quot; in both alcohol based and (D)PG based variants.

In small online &quot;bulk&quot;, however (in purchases over 5000RUB), a whole 100ml bottle of such perfume (or 50ml bottle of &quot;scent oil&quot; of same &quot;direction&quot;) costs only around 6 EUR.

==Health and environmental issues==

Perfume ingredients, regardless of natural or synthetic origins, may all cause health or environmental problems when used. Although the areas are under active research, much remains to be learned about the effects of fragrance on human health and the environment.

===Immunological; asthma and allergy===
Evidence in peer-reviewed journals shows that some fragrances can cause asthmatic reactions in some individuals, especially those with severe or atopic asthma. Many fragrance ingredients can also cause headaches, allergic skin reactions or nausea.

In some cases, an excessive use of perfumes may cause allergic reactions of the skin. For instance, acetophenone, ethyl acetate and acetone while present in many perfumes, are also known or potential respiratory allergens. Nevertheless, this may be misleading, since the harm presented by many of these chemicals (either natural or synthetic) is dependent on environmental conditions and their concentrations in a perfume. For instance, linalool, which is listed as an irritant, causes skin irritation when it degrades to peroxides, however the use of antioxidants in perfumes or reduction in concentrations can prevent this. As well, the furanocoumarin present in natural extracts of grapefruit or celery can cause severe allergic reactions and increase sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation.

Some research on natural aromatics have shown that many contain compounds that cause skin irritation. However some studies, such as IFRA&#x27;s research claim that opoponax is too dangerous to be used in perfumery, still lack scientific consensus.
It is also true that sometimes inhalation alone can cause skin irritation.
A number of national and international surveys have identified balsam of Peru, often used in perfumes, as being in the &quot;top five&quot; allergens most commonly causing patch test reactions in people referred to dermatology clinics. A study in 2001 found that 3.8% of the general population patch tested was allergic to it. Many perfumes contain components identical to balsam of Peru.

Balsam of Peru is used as a marker for perfume allergy. Its presence in a cosmetic is denoted by the INCI term &quot;Myroxylon pereirae&quot;. Balsam of Peru has been banned by the International Fragrance Association since 1982 from use as a fragrance compound, but may be present as an extract or distillate in other products, where mandatory labelling is not required for usage of 0.4% or less.

===Carcinogenicity===
There is scientific evidence that nitro-musks such as musk xylene could cause cancer in some specific animal tests. These reports were evaluated by the EU Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS, formerly the SCCNFP) and musk xylene was found to be safe for continued use in cosmetic products. It is in fact part of the procedures of the Cosmetic Regulation in Europe that materials classified as carcinogens require such a safety evaluation by the authorities to be allowed in cosmetic consumer products.

Although other ingredients such as polycyclic synthetic musks, have been reported to be positive in some in-vitro hormone assays, these reports have been reviewed by various authorities. For example, for one of the main polycyclic musks Galaxolide (HHCB) these reviews include those of the EU Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety, the EU&#x27;s Priority Substances Review, the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk, and more recently also the US EPA. The outcome of all of these reviews over the past decade or so is that there are no safety concerns for human health. Reviews with similar positive outcomes also exist for another main polycyclic musk (AHTN)—for instance, on its safe use in cosmetics by the EU.

Many natural aromatics, such as oakmoss absolutes, basil oil, rose oil and many others contain allergens or carcinogenic compounds, the safety of which is either governed by regulations (e.g. allowed methyl eugenol levels in the EU Cosmetics Regulation (Entry102, AnnexIII of the EU Cosmetics Regulation.) or through various limitations set by the International Fragrance Association.

===Environmental===
====Pollution====
Synthetic musks are pleasant in smell and relatively inexpensive, as such they are often employed in large quantities to cover the unpleasant scent of laundry detergents and many personal cleaning products. Due to their large-scale use, several types of synthetic musks have been found in human fat and milk, as well as in the sediments and waters of the Great Lakes.

These pollutants may pose additional health and environmental problems when they enter human and animal diets.

====Species endangerment====
The demands for aromatic materials such as sandalwood, agarwood, and musk have led to the endangerment of these species, as well as illegal trafficking and harvesting.

===Safety regulations===
The US FDA controls the safety of perfumes through their ingredients and requires that they be tested to the extent that they are Generally recognized as safe (GRAS). Due to the need for protection of trade secrets, companies rarely give the full listing of ingredients regardless of their effects on health.

In the EU, as from 11 March 2005, the mandatory listing of a set of 26 recognized fragrance allergens was enforced. The requirement to list these materials is dependent on the intended use of the final product. The limits above which the allergens are required to be declared are 0.001% for products intended to remain on the skin, and 0.01% for those intended to be rinsed off. This has resulted in many old perfumes like chypres and fougère classes, which traditionally make use of oakmoss extract, being reformulated.

==Preserving perfume==

Fragrance compounds in perfumes will degrade or break down if improperly stored in the presence of heat, light, oxygen, and extraneous organic materials.
Proper preservation of perfumes involves keeping them away from sources of heat and storing them where they will not be exposed to light. An opened bottle will keep its aroma intact for several years, as long as it is well stored. However, the presence of oxygen in the head space of the bottle and environmental factors will in the long run alter the smell of the fragrance.

Perfumes are best preserved when kept in light-tight aluminium bottles or in their original packaging when not in use, and refrigerated to relatively low temperatures: between . Although it is difficult to completely remove oxygen from the headspace of a stored flask of fragrance, opting for spray dispensers instead of rollers and &quot;open&quot; bottles will minimize oxygen exposure. Sprays also have the advantage of isolating fragrance inside a bottle and preventing it from mixing with dust, skin, and detritus, which would degrade and alter the quality of a perfume.

There exist several archives and museums devoted to the preservation of historical perfumes, namely the Osmothèque, which stocks over 3,000 perfumes from the past two millennia in their original formulations. All scents in their collection are preserved in non-actinic glass flasks flushed with argon gas, stored in thermally insulated compartments maintained at in a large vault.

<text>Jasmine (botanical name: Jasminum; ) is a genus of shrubs and vines in the olive family of Oleaceae. It contains around 200 species native to tropical and warm temperate regions of Eurasia, Africa, and Oceania. Jasmines are widely cultivated for the characteristic fragrance of their flowers. 

The village of Shubra Beloula in Egypt grows most of the jasmine used by the global perfume industry. 

== Description ==
Jasmine can be either deciduous or evergreen, and can be erect, spreading, or climbing shrubs and vines. The leaves are borne in opposing or alternating arrangement and can be of simple, trifoliate, or pinnate formation.

The flowers are typically around in diameter. They are white or yellow, although in rare instances they can be slightly reddish. The flowers are borne in cymose clusters with a minimum of three flowers, though they can also be solitary on the ends of branchlets. Each flower has about four to nine petals, two locules, and one to four ovules. They have two stamens with very short filaments. The bracts are linear or ovate. The calyx is bell-shaped. They are usually very fragrant.

The basic chromosome number of the genus is 13, and most species are diploid (2n=26). However, natural polyploidy exists, particularly in &quot;Jasminum sambac&quot; (triploid 3n=39), &quot;Jasminum flexile&quot; (tetraploid 4n=52), &quot;Jasminum mesnyi&quot; (triploid 3n=39), and &quot;Jasminum angustifolium&quot; (tetraploid 4n=52).

==Distribution and habitat==
Jasmines are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Eurasia, Africa, Australasia within Oceania, although only one of the 200 species is native to Europe. Their center of diversity is in South Asia and Southeast Asia.

Several jasmine species have become naturalized in Mediterranean Europe. For example, the so-called Spanish jasmine (&quot;Jasminum grandiflorum&quot;) was originally from West Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Northeast Africa, and East Africa, and is now naturalized in the Iberian Peninsula.

&quot;Jasminum fluminense&quot; (which is sometimes known by the inaccurate name &quot;Brazilian Jasmine&quot;) and &quot;Jasminum dichotomum&quot; (Gold Coast Jasmine) are invasive species in Hawaii and Florida. &quot;Jasminum polyanthum&quot;, also known as pink jasmine, is an invasive weed in Australia.

== Etymology ==
The name comes from Old French &quot;jessemin&quot;, from which is derived from the Middle Persian word and () in Arabic. The word entered Middle French around 1570 and was first used in English in 16th century England. The Persian name is also the origin of the genus name, &quot;Jasminum&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
Species belonging to the genus are classified under the tribe Jasmineae of the olive family (Oleaceae). &quot;Jasminum&quot; is divided into five sections—&quot;Alternifolia&quot;, &quot;Jasminum&quot;, &quot;Primulina&quot;, &quot;Trifoliolata&quot;, and &quot;Unifoliolata&quot;.

==Jasmonates==

Jasmine lends its name to jasmonate plant hormones, as methyl jasmonate isolated from the oil of &quot;Jasminum grandiflorum&quot; led to the discovery of the molecular structure of jasmonates. Jasmonates occur ubiquitously across the plant kingdom, having key roles in responses to environmental cues, such as heat or cold stress, and participate in the signal transduction pathways of many plants.

==Cultural importance==
Jasmine is cultivated commercially for domestic and industrial uses, such as the perfume industry. It is used in rituals like marriages, religious ceremonies, and festivals. Jasmine flower vendors sell garlands of jasmine, or in the case of the thicker &quot;motiyaa&quot; (in Hindi) or &quot;mograa&quot; (in Marathi) varieties, bunches of jasmine are common. They may be found around entrances to temples, on major thoroughfares, and in major business areas.

A change in presidency in Tunisia in 1987 and the Tunisian Revolution of 2011 are both called &quot;Jasmine revolutions&quot; in reference to the flower.

&quot;Jasmine&quot; is a common female given name.

===Symbolism===
Several countries and states consider jasmine as a national symbol.

* Syria: The Syrian city Damascus is called the City of Jasmine.
* Hawaii: &quot;Jasminum sambac&quot; (&quot;&quot;pikake&quot;) is a common flower used in leis and is the subject of many Hawaiian songs.
* Indonesia: &quot;Jasminum sambac&quot; is the national flower, adopted in 1990. It goes by the name &quot;melati putih&quot; and is used in wedding ceremonies for ethnic Indonesians, especially on the island of Java.
* Pakistan: &quot;Jasminum officinale&quot; is known as the &quot;chambeli&quot; or &quot;yasmin&quot;, it is the national flower.
* Philippines: &quot;Jasminum sambac&quot; is the national flower. Adopted in 1935, it is known as &quot;sampaguita&quot;&quot; in the islands. It is usually strung in garlands which are then used to adorn religious images.

<text>Anya Seton (January 23, 1904 – November 8, 1990), born Ann Seton, was an American author of historical fiction, or as she preferred they be called, &quot;biographical novels&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Anya Seton was born Ann Seton on January 23, 1904, at her parents&#x27; Bryant Park apartment in New York City. Her father, Ernest Thompson Seton, was Boy Scouts of America co-founder, naturalist, and author. Ernest, a British immigrant, has notable Scottish lineage in Northumberland. Ernest and his family immigrated to Canada in 1866, later moving to America. Her mother was Grace Gallatin Seton Thompson, an author, suffragist, two-time president of the National League of American Pen Women, and founder of the Campfire Girls. Seton grew up in the Connecticut towns of Cos Cob and Greenwich. 

Seton was primarily educated by private tutors and graduated from Spence School. She graduated on May 17, 1921, with a diploma in English but she never attended college. The Setons were wealthy, and Seton often traveled with her parents. Despite her family&#x27;s money, Seton very often moved homes. Because of this, Seton was unable to think of any place as her true home, nor any school as her true school. Ernest was often away, and even when he was around, he frequently criticized his daughter. Since her parents were often busy with their careers, Seton spent much time with her governess.

Seton&#x27;s parents did not have any other children. They separated in the late 1920s and divorced in 1934. Following the divorce, her father moved to New Mexico.

==Career==
Seton published her first novel, &quot;My Theodosia&quot;, in 1941.

Seton&#x27;s historical novels were noted for how extensively she researched the historical facts, and some of them were best-sellers: &quot;Dragonwyck&quot; (1944) and &quot;Foxfire&quot; (1950) were both made into Hollywood films. Three of her books are classics in their genre and continue in their popularity to the present: &quot;Katherine&quot; (1954)&quot;,&quot; the story of Katherine Swynford, the mistress and eventual wife of John of Gaunt, and their children, who were the direct ancestors of the Tudors, Stuarts, and the modern British royal family; &quot;Green Darkness&quot; (1973), the story of a modern couple plagued by their past life incarnations; and &quot;The Winthrop Woman&quot; about the notorious Elizabeth Fones, niece and daughter-in-law of John Winthrop, the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Most of her novels have been recently republished, several with forewords by Philippa Gregory. In 2003, &quot;Katherine&quot; was chosen as Britain’s 95th best-loved novel of all time in a nationwide poll conducted by the BBC.

Her 1962 novel &quot;Devil Water&quot; concerns James, the luckless Earl of Derwentwater and his involvement with the Jacobite rising of 1715. She also narrates the story of his brother Charles, beheaded after the 1745 rebellion, the last man to die for the cause. The action of the novel moves back and forth between Northumberland, Tyneside, London, and Virginia. Seton stated that the book developed out of her love for Northumberland. She certainly visited her Snowdon cousins at Felton. Billy Pigg, the celebrated Northumbrian piper played &quot;Derwentwater&#x27;s Farewell&quot; especially for her. The novel shows her typical thorough research of events and places, though the accents are a little wayward. Seton said that her greatest debt of all was to Amy Flagg of Westoe Village in South Shields, her father&#x27;s birthplace.

==Personal life==

Seton married twice. Her first marriage was to Hamilton &quot;Ham&quot; Cottier, a Rhodes scholar, whom she married when she was 19 years old. In 1925, Seton gave birth to their first child, a daughter named Pamela. Their second child, Seton, was born in 1928 and died of an overdose in 1979. Seton and Cottier divorced in 1930 following several extramarital affairs on Seton&#x27;s part.

Two weeks later, Seton married investment counselor Hamilton &quot;Chan&quot; M. Chase, whom she had had an affair with. Seton and Chase spent the early years of their marriage at her childhood home in Greenwich, Connecticut, Little Peequo, with Seton&#x27;s mother. They later built a home called Sea Rune in Old Greenwich, Connecticut. In 1930, Seton gave birth to the couple&#x27;s only daughter, Clemency. They divorced in 1968, though Seton continued to live at Sea Rune until her death. 

Seton died of heart failure at the age of 86 on November 8, 1990, at Sea Rune in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, and was survived by Pamela and Clemency, five grandchildren, and a great-grandchild. She is interred at Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich.

<doc id="98591" wikidata="Q53085" url="?curid=98591" title="Mexicana de Aviación (1921–2010)">
<text>Compañía Mexicana de Aviación S.A. de C.V., usually shortened to Mexicana de Aviación, was Mexico&#x27;s oldest airline and one of the oldest continuously single-branded airlines, inaugurated in 1921. It was Mexico&#x27;s biggest airline and flag carrier before ceasing operations on August 28, 2010, leaving competitor Aeroméxico as a &quot;de facto&quot; monopoly.

A revival airline is operated by SEDENA – the Mexican Ministry of Defense, as a state-owned airline. It began operations in December 2023 under the legal name Aerolínea del Estado Mexicano using the Mexicana brand.

==History==

Mexicana was Mexico&#x27;s first airline, and North America&#x27;s oldest airline and the world&#x27;s fourth oldest airline operating under the same name, after the Netherlands&#x27;s KLM, Colombia&#x27;s Avianca, and Australia&#x27;s Qantas. In addition to domestic services, Mexicana operated flights to various international destinations in North America, Central America, the Caribbean, South America and Europe. Their primary hub was Mexico City International Airport, with secondary hubs at Cancún International Airport, and Guadalajara International Airport.

Mexicana&#x27;s main competitors were Aeroméxico (although the two companies &quot;code shared&quot; on several routes) and low-cost carriers such as Volaris and Interjet (interjet has since ceased operations). 

In 2009, the Mexicana group of airlines (including Mexicana Click and Mexicana Link) carried just over 11 million passengers (6.6 million on domestic routes and 4.5 million on international routes), using a fleet of some 110 aircraft.

Over the three years prior to ceasing operations, the Mexicana group had increased their share of what was a burgeoning domestic market, from around 22% at the beginning of 2007 to somewhere between 28% and 30% for most of their final 12 months. This was achieved through downsizing mainline Mexicana operations whilst ramping up activities at Mexicana Click (originally envisaged as a low-cost carrier) and Mexicana Link (its CRJ-operating subsidiary based at Guadalajara).

After first joining Star Alliance in 2000, Mexicana left the alliance in 2004, before joining Oneworld on November 10, 2009. Mexicana entered bankruptcy protection in August 2010, in an attempt to restructure its business operations. On August 27, 2010, Mexicana announced it would suspend operations indefinitely effective noon August 28, 2010. Its subsidiaries Click and Link have since ceased their operations as well. On February 24, 2012, Mexicana Airlines announced for the first time in this Chapter 11 period that Med Atlantic bought the airline for $300 million.

The group&#x27;s closure was announced by the company&#x27;s recently installed management team a short time after the group filed for Concurso Mercantil (Mexican law equivalent to U.S. Chapter 11) and U.S. Chapter 15. On April 4, 2014, a judge declared Mexicana bankrupt and ordered to start selling off the company&#x27;s assets to repay the airline&#x27;s obligations. The headquarters of the company were in the Mexicana de Aviación Tower in Colonia del Valle, Benito Juárez, Mexico City. In January 2023, the Mexican federal government purchased the brand and majority of its shares. with plans to re-launch the state-owned airline. The airline will be managed by SEDENA – the Mexican Ministry of Defense.

===Formative years: 1920s===
William Lantie Mallory and George Rihl headed Compañía Mexicana de Aviación (&quot;Mexican Aviation Company&quot; or &quot;Mexican Airline Company&quot;), a competitor to CMTA; they acquired the latter&#x27;s assets in 1924 and the company that emerged existed until 2010. In 1925 Sherman Fairchild purchased a 20% stake in the Mexican airline, introducing Fairchild FC2 airplanes in 1928. In February 1929, Juan Trippe of Pan Am took over the majority of the airline&#x27;s stock, and the company opened its first international route, with service to the United States. Mexicana used the Ford Trimotor plane to operate the Mexico City-Tuxpan-Tampico-Brownsville, Texas, USA, route. Charles Lindbergh piloted the first flight on this route.

===1930s===
The 1930s, saw route expansion and service improvements. Mexicana opened a route from Brownsville to Guatemala City, stopping over at Veracruz, Minatitlán, Ixtepec and Tapachula. In addition, new routes were opened to El Salvador, Costa Rica and Cuba, in addition to Nicaragua and Panama, made possible by their association with Pan Am via Pan Am&#x27;s Miami base (Pan Am had undertaken flights from Mexico City to Miami.) Mexicana became the first foreign airline ever to fly to Los Angeles, when it began flights on January 3, 1936. The company expanded its fleet during that decade, with the addition of eight Fairchild FC2s and three Fokker F.10s. One of the Fokker F.10&#x27;s, tail number X-ABCR, crashed at Miami on August 7, 1931, but no other details are available.

===1940s===
The 1940s, were primarily a period of domestic growth, although an international service began linking Mexico City and Havana. Routes were opened to Monterrey, Nuevo Laredo, and Mérida. Additionally, a night flight to Los Angeles was established, which added to the company&#x27;s night-time service to Mérida. Though Mexicana initially used Douglas DC-2s for these flights, over time they were replaced by larger aircraft, such as the Douglas DC-3s – known as &quot;El Palacio Aéreo&quot; (The Air Palace) for their luxury and comfort – and, later, Douglas DC-4s. The DC-4 allowed Mexicana to offer a non-stop service from Mexico City to Los Angeles. During the decade, Mexicana established a certified pilot school in Mexico City.

===1950s===
The 1950s, saw the airline&#x27;s growth slow, though the fleet was modernized with the addition of Douglas DC-6s, and staff training improved with the opening of a flight attendant school. The DC-6s were put to work on the Mexico City to Puerto Vallarta and Mexico City to Oaxaca routes. Service to San Antonio, Texas began later in the decade.

===The Jet Age: 1960s===
In the 1960s, four De Havilland Comet 4C jets were bought: one is currently being restored by the Seattle Museum of Flight. The Comets&#x27; arrival saw Mexicana join the jet age on July 4, 1960, with a flight from Mexico City to Los Angeles. Despite its use of advanced aircraft, the competition was stiff, and by the late 1960s, the company faced bankruptcy. Amid the difficulties, the airline received its first Boeing 727-100. In 1967, the airline was serving six destinations in the U.S. including Corpus Christi, Dallas and San Antonio in Texas as well as Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami, and was also flying internationally to Havana, Cuba and Kingston and Montego Bay in Jamaica.

The financial situation brought about a change in the airline&#x27;s administration and on January 15, 1968, Mexican Crescencio Ballesteros took over as chairman. Manuel Sosa de la Vega was appointed as president and CEO. The new management team&#x27;s strategic plan soon saw the airline recover financially.

Despite its revival, 1969 was a difficult year for the airline as it lost two Boeing 727s. The first was in bad weather in a flight from Mexico City to Monterrey; the second was flying between Chicago and Mexico City.

===1970s===

In 1971, Mexicana started flights to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico – a route it would maintain for more than 25 years without interruption - (mainly from Mexico City, for a period the airline flew the routing San Juan-Mérida-Mexico City and vice versa), and to Denver, Colorado. The jet fleet kept expanding and eventually consisted of 19 jets, the largest jet fleet in Latin America at the time. They also started a flight simulator service with a 727 simulator at their hub in Mexico City International Airport. By this time Mexicana had the largest fleet of 727s outside the USA.

For its 50th anniversary, Mexicana de Aviacion was given a monument for being the First Airline of Mexico. After 2010 the monument has been a symbol of Aviacion in Mexico and to all of the Fallen Airlines that once served the country.

===1980s===

During the 1980s, Mexicana&#x27;s growth was static. However, a few events touched the company. In 1981, three McDonnell Douglas DC-10-15 wide-body jetliners joined the company&#x27;s fleet and began making their way through the airline&#x27;s Caribbean routes. This was the first wide-body aircraft type Mexicana ever operated and was intended for use on high-density routes. In 1982, the Mexican government acquired 58% of the airline, before privatizing it in August 1989. In 1984, construction of the company&#x27;s new corporate headquarters on Xola Avenue, Mexico City finished – the resulting 30-story building was designed to resemble an air traffic control tower. In March 1986, a Boeing 727, Mexicana Flight 940, en route to Puerto Vallarta caught fire in-flight and crashed in the mountains of western Mexico, killing everyone on board. This is the most recent fatal accident involving a Mexicana aircraft. In 1988, Aeronaves de Mexico (now operating as Aeromexico), Mexicana&#x27;s closest rival, declared bankruptcy. Consequently, Mexicana took over some of Aeromexico&#x27;s longer flights during the 1990s, including flights to Canada and South America.

===1990s===
The 1990s, brought a series of changes. At the beginning of the decade in 1990, Mexicana was serving thirteen destinations in the U.S. including Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Orlando, San Antonio, San Francisco, San Jose, CA, Seattle and Tampa as well as San Juan, Puerto Rico with additional international service to Guatemala City, Guatemala; Havana, Cuba and San Jose, Costa Rica. Deregulation of the Mexican airline industry brought new competitors such as LaTur, SARO and TAESA. Seeking to remain competitive, the airline updated its fleet with European-built Airbus A320s in 1991 and Dutch Fokker 100s in 1992. In 1993, a reorganized Aeroméxico took over as the company struggled financially. During the mid-1990s, the Mexican economy was hard-hit by the devaluation of the Mexican peso and Mexicana, Aeroméxico, and their regional affiliates were nationalized when their parent company, CINTRA (Corporación Internacional de Transporte Aereo), was taken over by the government. The airlines remained in their merged state until 2005. As happened in 1967, a new management team was hired, this time headed by President and CEO, Fernando Flores. The company was reorganized and rationalized, with a new emphasis placed on international service. Unprofitable routes were cut and the DC-10s were retired. The airline ventured deep into South America by adding flights to Lima, Peru, Santiago de Chile, and Buenos Aires, Argentina and further into North America, adding flights to Montreal, Canada. To operate these new and longer routes, the airline leased Boeing 757-200s. Another aspect of this reorganization involved the creation of alliances. Mexicana was part of regional alliances LatinPass and Alas de America, and they later formed an alliance with United Airlines. This latter alliance brought Mexicana into the network of global alliances, as it eventually led the airline into the Star Alliance. Recognizing the usefulness and importance of the Internet, the airline launched a website and eventually included a reservation center. Also around this time, Mexicana adopted a new color scheme, with assorted colors on the tails of their planes.

===1995–2005===
In 1995, Mexicana was merged with AeroMéxico as a part of CINTRA (the two airlines kept operating under their respective brand names). In 1996, the assorted color scheme was dropped in favor of green tails with white on the majority of the plane and the word &quot;Mexicana&quot; in black letters. In the 2000s, Mexicana continued to grow. They celebrated their 80th anniversary in July 2001, just before the terrorist attacks of September 11 sent worldwide aviation into a tailspin. Nevertheless, the airline continued to evolve. It officially joined the Star Alliance in 2000 amid much fanfare, only to exit in March 2004 in response to rapidly changing market conditions related to United Airlines bankruptcy, and the aftershocks of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. CEO Emilio Romano stated in the airline&#x27;s in-flight magazine VUELO that the airline left the alliance to pursue more effective code-sharing relationships with other airlines. Simultaneously, the airline created an alliance with American Airlines and several Oneworld partners leading some to speculate whether the airline would join that alliance. Nevertheless, it also maintained ties to some of its former Star Alliance partners, such as Lufthansa. In 2003, the airline retired its last Boeing 727-200 after operating the type for almost 40 years. These aircraft were replaced with newer A320s, A319s and A318s. Once an important Boeing Company operator, Mexicana transformed into an important Airbus Industrie airline, although it still operated one Boeing aircraft. The airline&#x27;s long haul operations were conducted by Boeing 767s, introduced in December 2003.

;2005
2005 was an important year as the airline was sold and several low-cost carriers were established in Mexico. Mexicana rebranded its regional subsidiary, Aerocaribe, as &quot;Click Mexicana&quot; and promotes it as a low-cost carrier. This is part of the company&#x27;s plan to remain competitive as the aviation industry changes and competition intensifies. Another component includes increasing international presence. Also, the color scheme was changed again to a dark blue tail and blue lettering on a white background.

====Sale====
Despite government announcements indicating that the airlines were going to be privatized, that move did not occur until November 29, 2005, when CINTRA sold Mexicana and its subsidiary, Click Mexicana, to the Mexican hotel chain Grupo Posadas for US$165.5 million. The road to privatization was long and winding. The government reversed its course on several occasions. At times, they proposed to sell Mexicana and AeroMéxico separately; other times, they proposed to sell them together to increase the bid price. They also proposed to sell the companies merged, but separate from their regional affiliates to increase competition. Several companies expressed interest in purchasing one or both of the airlines. For example, Iberia Airlines of Spain announced plans to buy part of both Mexicana and Aeroméxico. However, Mexicana&#x27;s owners rejected the offer possibly because another Iberia-owned Latin-American airline, Viasa of Venezuela, had gone bankrupt under Iberia&#x27;s ownership. Further, Aerolíneas Argentinas had previously rejected a similar offer by Iberia.

===2006–2007===

On July 12, 2006, Mexicana announced that it intended to begin service to several new destinations in the United States including Detroit and Charlotte. It intended to return to Puerto Rico, but the service came back only as a charter operation. It was also negotiating with Arkansas officials to begin service to Little Rock National Airport. Mexicana was named &quot;Best Airline in Latin America&quot; in 2006 and &quot;Best Business in Central and Latin America&quot;.

===2008===
On April 9, 2008, Oneworld invited Mexicana to join the alliance and the airline was expected to join the alliance on November 11, 2009, together with its two subsidiaries MexicanaClick and MexicanaLink, thus adding 26 destinations to the network. Iberia was the sponsor of Mexicana&#x27;s invitation into the Oneworld alliance. Mexicana was to compete with SkyTeam members Aeroméxico and Copa Airlines (which later left SkyTeam, possibly to join Star Alliance because of Continental Airlines&#x27; move to that alliance) and Star Alliance potential member TACA and member TAM for service between the US and Europe and Latin America. Mexicana was to start new flights to the US, Europe, and Brazil to better leverage its position.

In October 2008, Mexicana announced three new destinations, London (Gatwick), São Paulo (Brazil), and Orlando (U.S.). Service commenced December 8 for São Paulo (GRU) and Orlando (MCO), followed by London (LGW) on January 9. With this service expansion, Mexicana became the second Mexican airline with service to Europe and Brazil (Aeromexico has long-established service to Paris, Madrid, Rome and Barcelona in Europe, and São Paulo in Brazil), and first with service to the United Kingdom. The Orlando route was operated with a medium-range Airbus A320, London, and São Paulo were operated with 2 leased Boeing 767-200ER. In addition, Mexicana announced a Mexico City to Madrid route to compete with Aeromexico and complement its partner&#x27;s (Iberia) existing service. Mexicana announced that it will begin service to Madrid beginning in February 2009, through the acquisition of 2 Airbus A330-200 not taken by XL Airways UK due to bankruptcy.

On November 27, 2008, as part of a restructuring of Mexicana, it was announced that Click would stop operating as a separate Low-Cost airline and begin serving domestic destinations in Mexico as a regional feeder under the name MexicanaClick. At this time, a new, more colorful livery was introduced to the Mexicana fleet.

===2009===
On February 4, 2009, Mexicana won a concession to operate a new feeder airline to complement the routes currently covered by Mexicana and Mexicana Click. The new airline was to be called MexicanaLink and operate in low-density routes to feed mainline operations from Guadalajara&#x27;s airport. The airline flew Canadair CRJ-200 regional jet aircraft.

Also in February 2009, Mexicana applied to the US Department of Transportation to initiate daily, non-stop service between Guadalajara, Jalisco and New York utilizing either an Airbus A319 or the larger Airbus A320. On February 25 Mexicana joined the Airbus MRO network evaluating the Airbus A350.

===2010===
Mexicana filed for &quot;Concurso Mercantil&quot; (Mexican law equivalent to US Chapter 11) and US Chapter 15 on August 3, 2010, in both the U.S. and Mexico, following labor union disputes; a debt of US$125 million was reported. On August 5, 2010, Mexicana filed a motion to the Superior Court of Quebec (Commercial Division) of the District of Montreal to obtain the recognition of foreign proceedings regarding Section 46 and following of the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (“CCAA”). Subsequently, the airline scaled back its operations, suspending ticket sales and announcing the termination of selected routes. In early August 2010, the airline offered pilots and flight attendants a stake in the business in exchange for new labor terms. On August 24, a Mexican consortium called Tenedora K announced that it had bought 95% of Nuevo Grupo Aeronáutico; pilots would hold the other 5%.

After 89 years of service, Mexicana announced on August 27 that it would suspend all operations at noon CDT the following day on August 28, 2010.

The last Mexicana scheduled operation took place on August 28, 2010, with flight 866, departing Mexico City to Toronto, Canada at 4:15 PM (CST) on an Airbus A319-112 (XA-MXI).

Aeroméxico offered discounted tickets to passengers stranded by Mexicana&#x27;s suspension of operations. American Airlines and American Eagle Airlines also offered assistance, providing help to passengers between the 48 contiguous U.S. states and Mexico.

===Attempts to return to service===

====2010====
In November 2010, PC Capital SAPI, a Mexican private-equity firm, offered unions and other creditors a 1.9 billion peso ($155 million) proposal to rescue the bankrupt airline. The offer included giving unions 975 million pesos in cash and arrangement of a seven-year, 926 million peso loan paying monthly interest to the workers. The unions would have received an equity stake in exchange for the remaining 2.85 billion pesos Mexicana owes them.

The proposal would have seen the airline return with 28 planes, flying 17 international routes to the U.S. and Central America and seven domestic services. Creditors including Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB and Mexican development bank Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior SNC viewed the proposal favorably, as did the government.

The proposal had government support, with Mexico&#x27;s government seeking that the grounding be resolved in time for the December travel season when millions of local and foreign tourists will flock to resorts such as Cancun for holidays. &quot;Our goal must be that Mexicana returns to the skies by the December high season,&quot; Labor Minister Javier Lozano said at a press conference.

====2011====
Mexicana planned to restart services in 2011, operating 11 routes with 7 leased aircraft. Many of its domestic destinations were taken over by its former partner, Aeromar, VivaAerobus, and its low-cost competitor, Volaris. On March 4, PC Capital announced that it was withdrawing from the process, leaving Mexicana and the Mexican government without a viable option. Mexicana then announced a plan to offer only charter flights.

On November 11, the Mexican government announced that Iván Barona would invest 400 million dollars in Mexicana Airlines. Barona stated that Mexicana would resume operations in December 2011, with an aggressive business plan to regain all the territory lost, beginning with 9 Airbus A320s, and increasing the fleet size to 100 airplanes in 18 months. Barona failed to meet the conditions of the transaction, including a November 15 deadline, and the plan was terminated by the bankruptcy trustee.

====2012====
A Mexican judge declared that Mexicana was bought by Grupo Med Atlantica and announced that it may resume operations in 2012. On May 11, 2012, all the shares were transferred from Tenedora K to Med Atlantica. Christian Cardenas and the Spanish company Med Atlantica sought an Operation Certificate to restart operations. Med Atlantic was to invest $300 million to restart the airline with seven aircraft and a payroll of 2,000 workers. The company would have begun with 11 routes serving the following airports: Mexico City, Acapulco, Cancun, Guadalajara and Monterrey.
Med Atlantica was declared out of the process because Christian Cadenas (Med Atlantic representative) failed to cash in the resources needed for a possible restart of the company. In December, Mexicana Airlines had 3 possible investors, Iván Barona, owner of a mining group in Mexico; Grupo Fides Gestión Financiera, an investment group from Monterrey; and an unknown investor. Ivan Barona had until December 29 to invest 100 million dollars to Mexicana Airlines. After he failed to invest money, Grupo Fides had the opportunity to prove the group had the intention to buy Mexicana Airlines.

====2013-2017====
As of 2013, Med Atlantic and Grupo Fides were still trying to invest money in Mexicana Airlines.

On April 4, 2014, the Federal Judiciary Council announced that a judge declared the end of the bankruptcy proceedings due to a lack of credible investors.

In 2015, many of Mexicana&#x27;s former oneworld partners signed codeshare agreements with Interjet, one of Mexicana&#x27;s ex-main rivals. The alliance has stated that it&#x27;s interested in recruiting a new airline from Mexico. This would fill in the void left by Mexicana in 2010. Mexicana was listed as an inactive member of the alliance until 2017.

====2019-2022====
In November 2019, the Tribunal Federal de Conciliación y Arbitraje (Federal Court of Conciliation and Arbitration) ruled that Mexicana&#x27;s assets must be transferred to the former employees of the company. This decision was made to settle some of the company&#x27;s debt to the employees in unearned wages. Assets included a maintenance base, a pilot training center, and a VIP lounge.

In March 2020, Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador stated that there was a possibility of a new airline founded by former employees of Mexicana. The employees have also sought support from the past three presidents since the airline&#x27;s closure in 2010, but there were no progress. &quot;We are helping the employees to have options, like to have a new airline,&quot; he said. &quot;We can&#x27;t overrule the possibility of a cooperative, that they may have the authorizations (to do it).&quot;

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government of Mexico has sought to revive the airline due to lack of flights caused by the pandemic. The airline&#x27;s representatives have meet with the SCT and Interior Ministry Olga Sánchez Cordero for this purpose. Chances of the airline&#x27;s revival has increased following the recent suspension and financial struggles of low-cost carrier Interjet since December 2020. Miguel Ángel Yúdico Colín, secretary general of an aviation national union organization, has stated that investors will show interest in investing and operating once the business plan has been finalized. It is also expected to occupy the slots left by Interjet if it were to cease operations.

====2023====

In January 2023, it was reported that the Mexico government has signed a deal to purchase the Mexicana brand for $811 million pesos ($42 million USD). As part of Mexico president Andrés Manuel López Obrador&#x27;s plan, the deal would allow the resumption of the airline&#x27;s operations as a military-operated commercial carrier, and acquire buildings for training and simulation purposes. Legal actions placed against the airline since 2014 would also be lifted. Planned to relaunch sometime in 2023, the carrier would be based in Mexico City&#x27;s Felipe Ángeles International Airport.

The fleet was planned to have up to 19 leased Airbus A320-200 aircraft, with additional plans of purchasing Boeing 737 MAX planes. A Boeing 787-8 aircraft, formerly operated by the Mexican Air Force, was also planned to be inherited to the airline, but was withdrawn and instead will be used by Sedena.

According to President Obrador, the national law prohibiting the government of simultaneous airport and air operations would first have to be abolished, which is currently undergoing the change. He additionally stated that the airline&#x27;s revival could lead to increased competition and price drops, depending on Mexicana&#x27;s price balancing.

In May 2023, the government has reach an agreement with Boeing to supply aircraft for the airline.

President Obrador said that the airline is planned to launch by the &quot;end of [2023]&quot; with 10 aircraft, and recruit several former employees.

In July 2023, it was originally reported that the &quot;Mexicana&quot; revival brand would no longer be used after difficulties of reaching a deal with former workers, and slow processing, and the Mexican military would instead operate a new airline, called &quot;Aerolínea Maya&quot;. However, deals have been officially finalized by the Mexican government, and would retain the &quot;Mexicana de Aviación&quot; name under the Aerolínea del Estado Mexicano legal name. A little over a month prior to the inaugural flight, Mexicana still had no planes or scheduled flights.

Operating a Boeing 737-800 leased aircraft and 15 routes, the revival airline officially launched on December 26, 2023. Select flights are operated by TAR Aerolíneas, using its two wet-leased Embraer ERJ-145LR aircraft.

==== 2024 ====
Since resuming operations on December 26, 2023, the airline had completed a total of 220 flights. As of January 24, 2024, the airline has 16 daily flights, 112 weekly flights, and 448 flights monthly. During the first month of operations Tulum emerged as the most popular destination, serving 738 passengers. Other popular destinations the airline served include Tijuana, and Merida.

In line with the airlines emphasis on customer service, approximately 82% of passengers expressed their willingness to recommend Mexicana de Aviación to others.

==Alleged fraud==
The administration of president and owner Gastón Azcárraga attributed Mexicana&#x27;s flight cuts and possible bankruptcy to high labor costs. Azácarraga quickly left the company, leaving employees to deal with a new unknown owner, Tenedora K, which had no resources to restart operations. The Azácarraga administration had been subject to criticism until then. The Mexican government did not support the airline in its &quot;Concurso Mercantil&quot; (Chapter 11) process as they did with CEMEX and Comercial Mexicana.

On December 21, 2010 a Supreme Court Judge ordered the detention of former CEO Manuel Borja Chico for a 54 million peso tax evasion under his administration. The administration of new President Enrique Peña Nieto declared that the government would investigate Mexicana&#x27;s bankruptcy and find those responsible in parallel with restructuring the airline.

On February 19, 2014, Mexico&#x27;s attorney general&#x27;s office asked a federal judge to issue an arrest warrant for the former owner and president Azcárraga for suspected money laundering while running Mexicana. It was discovered that in 2006, Mexicana created a trust, “Fideicomiso 589”, to which more than 199 million pesos was extracted supposedly for the benefit of employees. However, at least 110 million pesos were used to purchase Mexicana shares from Grupo Posadas, also controlled by Azcárraga, with no benefit to Mexicana employees. Azcárraga – whose relatives control media giants Televisa and Univision – remains a fugitive of Mexican justice living in luxury in the United States.

==Subsidiaries==
===MexicanaClick===
In 2005, Aerocaribe was renamed Click Mexicana and replaced its fleet of McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s with Fokker 100 twin-jet aircraft. Click was a wholly owned subsidiary of Mexicana de Aviacion.

Mexicana used Click as a low-cost airline to counter low-cost competitors such as Aviacsa, Interjet, Avolar, and Volaris. Mexicana employed Click as a domestic feeder line on lower-passenger routes and times, while Mexicana focused on international and longer domestic routes. Mexicana considered adding the Airbus A319 to Click&#x27;s fleet to serve destinations in Central America and the Caribbean. Click had 22 Fokker 100 jets in an all economy-plus layout. The cabin had grey, leather seats with a 35° pitch and a Click logo on the headrests. In 2008, Mexicana and Click were invited to the Oneworld alliance at the member and member affiliate level, respectively.

Mexicana rebranded Click Mexicana as MexicanaClick with the announcement of the new corporate livery late November 2008. MexicanaClick highlighted the Mexicana linkage.

Mexicana said it signed an agreement in March 2009 with Boeing to lease 25 Boeing 717-200 jetliners to be operated by MexicanaClick. The B717s were planned to replace the Fokker F-100 aircraft being flown by MexicanaClick. Sixteen of the B717s had been previously operated by Midwest Airlines. Terms of the lease weren&#x27;t disclosed.

===MexicanaLink===
Short-lived subsidiary based at Guadalajara International Airport, serving as a feeder airline for both Mexicana and MexicanaClick. It was Mexicana&#x27;s regional carrier, while MexicanaClick was a low-fare domestic airline competing against Interjet, Volaris, and VivaAerobus.

===Livery===

Mexicana introduced new livery in the second half of 2008. It consists of a &quot;eurowhite&quot; fuselage with the front in marine blue outlining a stylized eagle. The tail features the same eagle in marine blue with a light-blue background. The new graphic design is the work of Danish design agency Design:Success and Kristofer Matti, Peter Danroth &amp; Gabriel Martínez Meave, a renowned Mexican designer who has received several international awards, most recent of them from the Type Directors Club. This livery was used until the airline&#x27;s demise in August 2010.

During the 1970s and the 1980s, the original Mexicana livery consisted of a white fuselage with gold stripes. This livery was used mainly on Boeing 727-200s.

In 1991, Mexicana introduced a new livery, this time with coloured tails. This special &#x27;Mexican tapestry-style&#x27; livery was used mainly on Boeing 727-200s, Airbus A320-200s and Fokker F100s.

==Accidents and incidents==
Up to 2011, Mexicana had been involved in a total of 26 incidents, including nine fatal.

The 1949 Mexicana DC-3 crash took place on September 26, 1949, when a Mexicana de Aviacion DC-3 crashed into the Popocatepetl volcano during a flight between Tuxtla Gutierrez and Mexico City with stops in Ixtepec, Oaxaca , Oaxaca City and Tapachula. The plane, flying the Tapachula to Mexico City leg, crashed during landing, killing all 23 occupants, including actress Blanca Estela Pavon.

On September 24, 1952, a man gave a bag to the flight attendant on Flight 575, saying it was for another passenger. The bag exploded 45 minutes into the flight, which had been delayed 40 minutes due to a shift change with another flight attendant. Five were injured. The bombers were sentenced to 40 years in prison.

On September 9, 1959, while Fight 621 was en route to Merida, a male passenger detonated a bomb at 11,000 feet, falling to his death. A small fire appeared but was put out, and the plane landed at Poza Rica.

On June 4, 1969, Flight 704 crashed near Salinas Victoria; some 20 miles north of the city of Monterrey. All 79 people on board were killed, including Mexican tennis star Rafael Osuna. The aircraft was a Boeing 727-64, with tail number XA-SEL, and was approaching Monterrey&#x27;s airport. It had made a continuous descent in the last 5 minutes before impact. The pilot turned left instead of right once the aircraft passed over the Monterrey VOR, apparently not knowing his exact position at the time.

On September 21, 1969, Flight 801 another Mexicana Boeing 727-64, with tail number XA-SEJ, crashed short of the runway 23L at Mexico City International Airport. Of the 118 people on board, 27 died. The aircraft had been cleared for an ILS approach when it suddenly lost altitude and hit the ground. After becoming airborne once again, the plane crashed into a railway embankment. At the time of the impact, the aircraft was in a normal landing configuration. Since the flight data recorder had been installed improperly two days before and there was no cockpit voice recorder, the cause of the crash couldn&#x27;t be established.

On March 31, 1986, Flight 940 crashed in Las Mesas; near Maravatio, Michoacan. All 167 people on board the Boeing 727-264 were killed, making it the deadliest plane crash in the country&#x27;s history and the deadliest ever to have involved this type of aircraft. The left main gear brake was overheated during the take-off run. After reaching an altitude of 31,000 feet, a tire in the left main landing gear burst and crippled the plane&#x27;s controls, causing an in-flight fire and an explosive decompression in the process. It was found that the tire had been filled with air rather than nitrogen, leading to a chemical explosion within the tire itself.

<text>Samuel Shellabarger (18 May 1888 – 21 March 1954) was an American educator and author of both scholarly works and best-selling historical novels.

Born 18 May 1888 in Washington, D.C., Shellabarger was orphaned in infancy, upon the death of both his father Robert and his mother Elizabeth, in January 1889. Samuel resultantly was raised in the household of his paternal grandfather also named Samuel Shellabarger, a noted lawyer who had served in Congress during the American Civil War and as Minister to Portugal. The younger Samuel Shellabarger&#x27;s travels with his grandfather would prove invaluable in the provision of background material for the former&#x27;s historical novels.

Shellabarger attended private schools and in 1909 graduated from Princeton University, where he would later teach. After studying for a year at Munich University in Germany, he resumed his studies at Harvard University and Yale University. Despite taking a year off to serve in World War I, he received his doctorate in 1917. In 1915 he married Vivan Georgia Lovegrove Borg whom he had met the year before during a vacation in Sweden. They had four children, but the two boys died: one as an infant and the other serving in World War II. From 1938 to 1946 Samuel Shellabarger served as the head of Columbus School for Girls in Columbus, Ohio. Shellabarger himself died of a heart attack at his Princeton, New Jersey home on 21 March 1954.

Having already published some scholarly works and not wanting to undermine their credibility by publishing fiction, Shellabarger used pen names for his first mysteries and romances: &quot;John Esteven&quot; and then &quot;Peter Loring.&quot; He continued to write scholarly works and to teach, but his historical novels proved so popular that he soon started using his own name on them. Some of them were best-sellers and were made into movies.

<text>Demographic features of the population of the Soviet Union include vital statistics, ethnicity, religious affiliations, education level, health of the populace, and other aspects of the population. 

During its existence from 1922 until 1991, the Soviet Union had one of the largest populations in the world. When the last census was taken in 1989, the USSR had the third largest in the world with over 285 million citizens, behind China and India. The former nation was a federal union of national republics, home to hundreds of different ethnicities. By the time the Soviet Union dissolved, Russians were the largest ethnic group by making up nearly 51% of the country. The remaining 49% of Soviet citizens identified with a variety of groups, inlcuding Ukrainians, Belarusians, Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Georgians, Jews, etc. 

== History ==

=== Revolution and Civil war, 1917–1923 ===
During the Russian Revolution and Civil War period, Russia lost former territories of the Russian Empire with about 30 million inhabitants after the Russian Revolution of 1917 (Poland: 18 million; Finland: 3 million; Romania: 3 million; the Baltic states: 5 million, Kars: 400 thousand). At least 2 million citizens of the former Russian Empire died in the course of the Russian Civil War of 1917–1923, and a further 1 to 2 million emigrated.

=== Interwar period, 1924 to 1939 ===
An estimated 800,000 to 1,200,000 people died during the purges of the 1930s.

=== World War Two, 1939–1945 ===
According to the Russian Academy of Sciences the Soviet Union suffered 26.6 million deaths (1941–1945) during World War II, including an increase in infant mortality of 1.3 million. Total war-loss figures include territories annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939–1945. At this time, the population pyramid was starting to look more triangular.

To counter the population loses, the Soviet government started to push pro natalist policies, such as a Childless tax and a award for mothers called the Mother Heroine.

=== Rejuvenation of the population, 1946–1960s ===
After the Second World War, the population of the Soviet Union began to gradually recover to pre-war levels. By 1959 there were a registered 209,035,000 people, over the 1941 population count of 196,716,000. In 1958–59, Soviet fertility stood at around 2.8 children per woman.

=== Population dynamics in the 1970–1980s ===
The crude birth rate in the Soviet Union throughout its history had been decreasing – from 44.0 per thousand in 1926 to 18.0 in 1974, mostly due to urbanization and rising average age of marriages. The total fertility rate fell from 2.4 in 1969–70 to 2.3 in 1978–79. The crude death rate had been gradually decreasing as well – from 23.7 per thousand in 1926 to 8.7 in 1974. While death rates did not differ greatly across regions of the Soviet Union through much of Soviet history, birth rates in the southern republics of Transcaucasia and Central Asia were much higher than those in the northern parts of the Soviet Union, and in some cases even increased in the post-World War II period. This was partly due to slower rates of urbanization and traditionally early marriages in southern republics.

Mainly as a result of differential birthrates, with most of the European nationalities moving toward sub-replacement fertility and the Central Asian and other nationalities of southern republics having well-above replacement-level fertility, the percentage of the population who were ethnic Russians was gradually being reduced. According to some Western predictions made in the 1990s, if the Soviet Union had stayed together, it is likely that ethnic Russians would have lost their majority status in the 2000s (decade). This differential could not be offset by assimilation of non-Russians by Russians, in part because the nationalities of southern republics maintained a distinct ethnic consciousness and were not easily assimilated.

The late 1960s and the 1970s witnessed a dramatic reversal of the path of declining mortality in the Soviet Union, and was especially notable among men in working ages, and also especially in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country. While not unique to the Soviet Union (Hungary in particular showed a pattern that was similar to Russia), this male mortality increase, accompanied by a noticeable increase in infant mortality rates in the early 1970s, drew the attention of Western demographers and Sovietologists at the time.

An analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, the situation for adult mortality began to improve again. Referring to data for the two decades ending in 1989–1990, while noting some abatement in adult mortality rates in the Soviet republics in the 1980s, Ward Kingkade and Eduardo Arriaga characterized this situation as follows: &quot;All the former Soviet countries have followed the universal tendency for mortality to decline as infectious diseases are brought under control while death rates from degenerative diseases rise. What is exceptional in the former Soviet countries and some of their East European neighbors is that a subsequent increase in mortality from causes other than infectious disease has brought about overall rises in mortality from all causes combined. Another distinctive characteristic of the former Soviet case is the presence of unusually high levels of mortality from accidents and other external causes, which are typically associated with alcoholism.&quot;

The rising infant mortality rates in the Soviet Union in the 1970s became the subject of much discussion and debate among Western demographers. The infant mortality rate (IMR) had increased from 24.7 in 1970 to 27.9 in 1974. Some researchers regarded the rise in infant mortality as largely real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services. Others regarded it as largely an artifact of improved reporting of infant deaths, and found the increases to be concentrated in the Central Asian republics where improvement in coverage and reporting of births and deaths might well have the greatest effect on increasing the published rates.

The rising reported adult mortality and infant mortality was not explained or defended by Soviet officials at the time. Instead, they simply stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years. Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late 1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed and researchers could delve into the real and artificial aspects of the reported mortality increases. When these researchers began to report their findings, they accepted the increases in adult male mortality as real and focused their research on explaining its causes and finding solutions. In contrast, investigations of the rise in reported infant mortality concluded that while the reported increases in the IMR were largely an artifact of improved reporting of infant deaths in the Central Asian republics, the actual levels in this region were much higher than had yet been reported officially. In this sense, the reported &quot;rise&quot; in infant mortality in the Soviet Union as a whole was an artifact of improved statistical reporting, but reflected the reality of a much higher actual infant mortality &quot;level&quot; than had previously been recognized in official statistics.

As the detailed data series that was ultimately published in the late 1980s showed, the reported IMR for the Soviet Union as a whole increased from 24.7 in 1970 to a peak of 31.4 in 1976. After that the IMR gradually decreased and by 1989 it had fallen to 22.7, which was lower than had been reported in any previous year (though close to the figure of 22.9 in 1971). In 1989, the IMR ranged from a low of 11.1 in the Latvian SSR to a high of 54.7 in the Turkmen SSR.

Research conducted after the dissolution of the Soviet Union revealed that the originally reported mortality rates vary substantially underestimated the actual rates, especially for infant mortality. This has been shown for Transcaucasian and Central Asian republics.

After two decades of declining and stagnating fertility rates, the Soviet TFR rose from 2.27 in 1978–79 to 2.51 in 1986–87. Most Muslim areas of the USSR continued to fall, while non-Muslim regions rose slightly.

== Population ==

Although the population growth-rate decreased over time, it remained positive throughout the history of the Soviet Union in all republics, and the population grew each year by more than 2 million except during periods of wartime, and famine.
=== Age structure ===


===Literacy===
*99.8% (1980)

===Labor force===
Labor force: 152,300,000 civilians; 80% industry and other nonagricultural fields, 20% agriculture; shortage of skilled labor (1989)

Organized labor: 98% of workers were union members; all trade unions were organized within the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions (AUCCTU) and conducted their work under the guidance of the Communist party. There was a market relationship between the people and the state as the employer; people were free to choose their job and leave if they wished, although members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union could be ordered to work in certain places, but seldom were.

===Life expectancy and infant mortality===
A newborn Soviet child in 1926–27 had a life expectancy of 44.4 years, up from 32.3 years in the Russian Empire thirty years before. By 1958–59, the life expectancy for newborns had reached 68.6 years. Life expectancy in the Soviet Union remained fairly stable during most years, although in the 1970s it decreased slightly.

== Ethnic groups ==

The Soviet Union was one of the world&#x27;s most ethnically diverse countries, with more than 100 distinct national ethnicities living within its borders.
===Ethnic Groups (1926–1989)===
Other ethnic groups included Abkhaz, Adyghes, Aleuts, Assyrians, Avars, Bulgarians, Buryats, Chechens, Chinese, Cossacks, Crimean Tatars, Evenks, Finns, Gagauz, Greeks, Hungarians, Ingushes, Inuit, Kalmyks, Karakalpaks, Karelians, Kets, Koreans, Lezgins, Maris, Mongols, Nenetses, Ossetians, Roma, Romanians, Tats, Tuvans, Udmurts, and Yakuts. Dozens of these other ethnic groups were the titular nations of different Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics or Autonomous Oblasts within the union-level republics (ex. Tatars in Tatar ASSR within the RSFSR, Abkhaz ASSR within Georgia) or had been previously (Volga German ASSR, Crimean ASSR).

===History===
Throughout its entire history, ethnic Russians made up a majority of Soviet citizens. According to the 1939 census, Russians reached a peak of 58.4% of the population. Previously in 1926, Russians were 52.9% of the population. This could be due to the decrease of Ukrainians, which coincides with the Holodomor.

Since 1939, the percentage of ethnic Russians in the USSR began to decrease. By 1959, 54.6% of Soviet citizens were recorded as ethnic Russians. At first, this was due to the incorporation of new territories westward in Europe after World War II, such as the Polish Eastern Borderlands, the Baltic states, Carpathian Ruthenia, and Bessarabia. This resulted in an increase of non-Russian ethnic groups, especially those who were Belarusian, Ukrainian, Polish, Moldovan, Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian. However, starting in the 1960s, the decline of the Russian majority was mainly driven by indigenous ethnic groups residing in the Caucasian and Central Asian Soviet republics. For example, the five main Central Asian groups, Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tajiks, and Turkmens, together saw a 163.81% increase from 1959 to 1989. Azerbaijanis, the largest Muslim group in the Soviet Caucasus, grew from 2.9 million people to almost 6.8 million during the same time, which represents a 130.31% increase. Meanwhile, ethnic Russians increased by only 27.20%. When the 1989 census was released, ethnic Russians made up just 50.8% of the population and were projected to become a minority within the next decade.
The rise of non-Russians, especially Soviet Muslims from the Caucasus and Central Asia can be explained by analysing the different patterns of total fertility rates among ethnic groups. According to research professors Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, Soviet fertility was both high and low. The national rate stood at 2.8 children per woman in 1958–59 before falling to 2.4 in 1969–70 and 2.3 in 1978–79. The total fertility for ethnic Russian women within the RSFSR declined from 2.4 to 1.8 in the late 1960s and 1970s. The same trend could be found in the Baltic and Western regions of the USSR, which each of the Soviet republics&#x27; titular nationality approaching sub-replacement fertility. Caucasian ethnic groups, such as Armenians and Georgians followed the same trend, but on average had more children than Soviet citizens living in the Soviet European republics. Overall, the mentioned ethnicities had an average total fertility rate between 1.8 and 2.3 by 1978–79. In contrast, Soviet Muslim women had much higher fertility rates. In 1969–70, the average Muslim woman had 7 children, which represents an increase from 6.2 in 1958–59. Despite decreasing to 5.6 in 1978–79 and further falling in the 1980s, the birth rate amongst Soviet Muslims remained consistently higher than those who were non-Muslims.

== Religion ==

The Soviet Union promoted state atheism from 1928 to 1941, in which religion was largely discouraged and heavily persecuted. The USSR remained a secular state from 1945 until its dissolution. However, according to various Soviet and Western sources, over one-third of the country&#x27;s people professed religious beliefs: Russian Orthodox 20%, Muslim 10%, Protestant, Georgian Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, and Roman Catholic 7%, Jewish less than 1%, atheist 60% (1990 est.). Some indigenous pagan belief systems existed in the Siberian and Russian Far Eastern lands in the local populations.

== Language ==

Russian became the official language of the Soviet Union in 1990. Until that time it was still necessary to have a language of common communication. The &quot;de facto&quot; result inevitably favored Russian, the native language of half of Soviet citizens.

Overall Soviet citizens spoke more than 200 languages and dialects (at least 18 with more than 1 million speakers); Slavic group: 75%, other Indo-European: 8%, Altaic: 12%, Uralic: 3%, Caucasian: 2% (1990 est.)

<text>Kristin Laura Kreuk (; born December 30, 1982) is a Canadian actress. Debuting on teen drama &quot;Edgemont&quot;, she became most known for her roles as Lana Lang in the superhero television series &quot;Smallville&quot; (2001–2011), Catherine Chandler in The CW sci-fi series &quot;Beauty &amp; the Beast&quot; (2012–2016) and as Joanna Hanley in the CBC legal drama series &quot;Burden of Truth&quot; (2018–2021). In 2009, she portrayed Chun-Li in the American martial arts film &quot;Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li&quot;.

==Early life==
Kreuk was born in Vancouver, British Columbia to Deanna Che and Peter Kreuk, two landscape architects. Her father is of Dutch descent. Her mother is of Chinese descent, born in Indonesia. Her maternal grandmother was Chinese Jamaican. Her mother and grandmother lived in Singapore and the Solomon Islands before settling in Vancouver. She has a younger sister, Justine Kreuk.
Kreuk trained in karate and gymnastics at the national level until high school but quit in grade 11 due to scoliosis. Kreuk was planning to study forensic science or psychology at Simon Fraser University and was surprised when a casting director for the CBC television series &quot;Edgemont&quot; contacted her at her high school.

==Career==
===Television===

After filming the first season of &quot;Edgemont&quot; (a teenage soap opera set at a Vancouver-area high school) and getting herself an agent, Kreuk landed the lead role of Snow White in a TV movie, &quot;Snow White: The Fairest of Them All&quot;, which aired on ABC, and later released on DVD, in 2002. In mid-2004, Kreuk took the role of Tenar for the Sci-Fi Channel&#x27;s two-part miniseries &quot;Earthsea&quot;. The miniseries was filmed in Vancouver, directed by Robert Lieberman and broadcast on December 13, 2004.

After &quot;Snow White&quot;, Kreuk&#x27;s agent sent an audition tape to screenwriters Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, who at the time were putting together the cast of a show they had created for the WB Network (now The CW) entitled &quot;Smallville&quot;. The series, which was slated to be shot in Vancouver, revolves around the life of teenager Clark Kent before he becomes Superman. Gough and Millar called Kreuk to WB&#x27;s studios in Burbank, California to audition for the role of Clark Kent&#x27;s first love, Lana Lang, and she was later cast in the part. For a while, Kreuk was starring on both &quot;Smallville&quot; and &quot;Edgemont&quot;, although her role on &quot;Edgemont&quot; slightly diminished over time. &quot;Edgemont&quot; ended its run in 2005. After seven seasons, Kreuk left &quot;Smallville&quot; in the beginning of 2008, when her character leaves town. She returned as a guest star in the show&#x27;s 8th season for five episodes to conclude her storyline.
In 2009, Kreuk signed on for a multi-episode arc in season three of &quot;Chuck&quot;. She played Hannah, a computer troubleshooter who joins the Buy More Nerd Herd after being laid off from her previous job.

In 2010, she portrayed Judah Ben-Hur&#x27;s sister Tirzah in the TV movie &quot;Ben Hur&quot;, which aired in Canada and later on ABC in the United States.

Kreuk was involved with two pilots that did not get picked up: a 2010 CBS sitcom entitled &quot;Hitched&quot; (which was co-created by Josh Schwartz, who was also the creator of &quot;Chuck&quot;) and a 2011 NBC drama series called &quot;17th Precinct&quot;, which was made by Ronald D. Moore.

In February 2012, Kreuk was announced as the lead female character in The CW&#x27;s reboot of &quot;Beauty &amp; the Beast&quot;, which was picked up on May 11, 2012, and started airing in Fall 2012. The CW announced in October 2015 that the show&#x27;s upcoming fourth season, scheduled to air over the summer of 2016, would be its final season. The series finale aired on August 25, 2016.
In 2018, Kreuk played the lead role in &quot;Burden of Truth&quot;, a CBC Television production in which she portrays a &quot;big-city lawyer who takes on a case for a group of sick girls in her hometown&quot;. The show premiered on January 10, 2018. On April 5, 2018, The CW announced that they had acquired the rights to air the show beginning in summer 2018. CBC has renewed &quot;Burden of Truth&quot; for a fourth season. The series concluded in 2021 after four seasons.

In 2024 Kreuk stars in &quot;Murder in a Small Town&quot;, which airs on Global in Canada, and Fox in the United States,

===Films===
Kreuk appeared in the comedy film &quot;EuroTrip&quot; (2004), playing the girlfriend who cheats on the protagonist with a musician (played by Matt Damon).

In early 2005, Kreuk signed on to the Canadian independent film &quot;Partition&quot; (2007), playing Naseem, a vulnerable 17-year-old whose world is shattered by the trauma of the Partition of India in 1947; the character also falls in love with an ex-British Indian Army officer. In the summer of 2006, Kreuk starred in the short film, &quot;Dream Princess&quot; by comic book writer/artist Kaare Andrews. The film is a modern sci-punk retelling of the tale of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, with a twist. However, it never aired. Kreuk starred in the film &quot;Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li&quot; (2009), in which she played the title character, Chun-Li. She tested for the sequel &quot;&quot; (2011), with the role going to Paula Patton.

In early 2010, Kreuk signed onto the Japanese horror film &quot;Vampire&quot; (2011). In 2010, Kreuk also starred in the music video &quot;I Heard&quot; by musician Hill Zaini.

Kreuk stars as Heather in the film &quot;Irvine Welsh&#x27;s Ecstasy&quot; (2011), based on Irvine Welsh&#x27;s novel. She also stars as Tilda in the science fiction comedy film &quot;Space Milkshake&quot; (2012).

====Film production====
Kreuk, with Rosena Bhura, whom Kreuk met on the set of &quot;Partition&quot;, started a production company called Parvati Creative Inc, which focuses on &quot;human-centric films as seen through a female lens&quot;. Parvati&#x27;s first production was a short film directed by Rick Rosenthal called &quot;Blink&quot;, of which Kreuk is listed as an executive producer. The second project was a comedy web series titled &quot;Queenie&quot; which featured Kreuk&#x27;s friend Olivia Cheng.

===Advertising work===
In 2003, Neutrogena made her the spokesmodel for their worldwide advertising campaign. In this role, Kreuk followed in the footsteps of fellow teen stars such as Jennifer Love Hewitt and Mandy Moore. In 2005, she renewed her contract with Neutrogena for another two years, becoming the company&#x27;s longest-serving model spokesperson.

===Voice acting===
In August 2017, Kreuk provided the voice for Princess Shuyan in &quot;Shuyan Saga&quot;, a graphic novel series set in an ancient Chinese martial arts fantasy universe. She also reprised her role as Catherine Chandler from &quot;Beauty &amp; the Beast&quot; on &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kruek holds a purple belt in Shotokan karate, and is learned in acrobatics and wushu.

Kreuk moved back to Vancouver in September 2022, after living in Toronto for a few years to study her undergraduate degree and pursue producing opportunities. She stated on &quot;Live! with Kelly and Michael&quot; in October 2012 that she is a pescetarian.

In November 2017, Kreuk and her &quot;Smallville&quot; co-star Allison Mack were linked to a multi-level marketing organization and cult known as NXIVM, which was founded by Keith Raniere. In March 2018, following Raniere&#x27;s arrest, Kreuk disclosed on her Twitter account that she had joined NXIVM believing it was a &quot;self-help&quot; group but left in 2014, and had not witnessed any illegal or nefarious activities during her time in the group. Kreuk&#x27;s statement was backed by actress Sarah Edmondson, who had participated in exposing NXIVM&#x27;s activities.

<text>Smallville is a fictional town in American comic books published by DC Comics. The childhood hometown of Superman, Smallville was first named in &quot;Superboy&quot; #2 (May 1949). The town, long in an unnamed US state that was first defined as Kansas in &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; (1978), is the setting of many &quot;Superboy&quot; comics where Superboy defends Smallville from various threats. Since the 1978 appearance in &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;, Smallville has been a setting in other non-comic book productions (film, television, video games and novels) featuring Superboy / Superman.

==History==

The DC Comics universe has several different timelines, with a major reboot in the 1985 Crisis on Infinite Earths.

===Pre-Crisis===
In the earliest Golden Age comics, the name of Clark Kent&#x27;s hometown is uncertain. Earliest stories would either show Clark&#x27;s hometown as unnamed or even as Metropolis. In Superman #35 (1945) a traveling Clark Kent stops off in Smallville without identifying it as his hometown. However, as of &quot;Superboy&quot; #2, Smallville&#x27;s name is permanently identified.

Smallville is retroactively shown as the Golden Age Superman&#x27;s childhood hometown as well, as seen in the &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Superman&quot; series in &quot;Superman Family&quot;, as well as in &quot;The New Adventures of Superboy&quot; #15-16 (March–April 1981). Unlike Earth-One&#x27;s Smallville, Earth-Two&#x27;s Smallville stays a much less prominent small town since the Earth-Two Superman was never Superboy. Additionally, the Kents never owned a general store on Earth-Two, but instead stayed farmers until their deaths.

===Post-Crisis===
Smallville&#x27;s history, as well as that of the Kents, is delved into in the late 1980s &quot;World of Smallville&quot; miniseries, plus the 1997-1998 miniseries &quot;The Kents&quot;.

Later, Smallville was retconned to have a violent history, with green kryptonite, a common substance in the area, having a mutating, dangerous effect on normal citizens of the town (similar to the TV show &quot;Smallville&quot;). This history, plus the near-destruction and reconstruction of the town by overzealous government forces, is explored in the storyline &quot;The Search For Kryptonite.&quot;

==Law and government==
Smallville&#x27;s chief of police is Chief Douglas Parker, who in pre-Crisis stories is considered a close ally of Superboy. Superboy is capable of being contacted by Chief Parker, as well as Lana Lang&#x27;s father Professor Lewis Lang and the President of the United States, via a secret signal lamp hidden in the Kent household. Chief Parker exists in the post-Crisis DC comics, but his role is much less prominent.

In the modern comics, Smallville also has a sheriff department. It is headed by Sheriff Hayes who is murdered by a Black Lantern version of Earth-Two&#x27;s Superman at the time when he was talking to his superiors about transferring to Metropolis.

A storyline late in the run of &quot;The New Adventures of Superboy&quot; sees Smallville&#x27;s town council propose building Smallville&#x27;s first shopping mall, though the mall&#x27;s construction is revealed out to have sinister ulterior motives. While the storyline is unfinished as the comic was cancelled before the story could be concluded, it does see Jonathan Kent decide to run for a city council seat to try to thwart the mall&#x27;s construction.

==People==
Noted residents of Smallville include the Kent family, Jonathan and Martha Kent, or &quot;Ma and Pa Kent&quot; as they were often called, and their adopted son Clark Kent; Clark&#x27;s friend, classmate and sometimes romantic interest Lana Lang; Clark&#x27;s best friend Pete Ross, and Smallville&#x27;s chief of police Douglas Parker.

In the original &quot;Superboy&quot; comics, other noted residents include Professor Phineas Potter (Lana&#x27;s uncle), archaeologist Lewis Lang (Lana&#x27;s father), and the young Lex Luthor.

In post-Crisis comics, Conner Kent, an alternate Superboy, also lives in Smallville with the now-widowed Martha Kent. The super-powered dog Krypto lives with them as well. While not initially enjoying Smallville, Conner eventually changes his mind.

==Features==
Smallville is usually portrayed as an idyllic, small isolated American town, with a &quot;Middle America&quot; atmosphere – resembling the settings of some paintings of Norman Rockwell. Its residents are generally very friendly, though in Silver Age &quot;Superboy&quot; stories, it also tends to attract various threats (from criminals, alien invaders, etc.).

Smallville&#x27;s economy mostly consists of various locally owned businesses, along with various farms surrounding the town, including the Kent family farm. In the original &quot;Superboy&quot; comics, the Kent family sells their farm when Clark starts school, and open a general store in town. Post-Crisis comics, however, show the Kents residing on their farm through Clark&#x27;s adulthood.

Smallville has one high school, Smallville High School, which Clark, Lana, and Pete attend.

Smallville also was the home of the Smallville Orphanage, where the Kents originally brought the infant Kal-El after his rocket landed on Earth; the Kents returned several days later to formally adopt Kal-El, renaming him &quot;Clark.&quot;

In terms of media, Smallville has had several newspapers mentioned over the years, including the &quot;Smallville Sentinel&quot; (shown in various stories in &quot;The New Adventures of Superboy&quot;) and the &quot;Smallville Times-Reader&quot; (in Elliot S. Maggin&#x27;s &quot;Last Son of Krypton&quot; text novel). In &quot;Action Comics&quot; (vol. 2) #8, the &quot;Daily Star&quot;&#x27;s editor George Taylor mentions to Clark Kent having met Ma and Pa Kent while working as a reporter for the &quot;Smallville Sentinel&quot;. Smallville receives most of its television and radio broadcasts from a larger nearby city, though &quot;Superboy&quot; #195 shows Smallville has its own radio station, WSMV.

In the original &quot;Superboy&quot; comics, a billboard outside of Smallville greets those driving into and out of town. The billboard features a picture of Superboy waving, with words next to it reading: &quot;Welcome to Smallville, Home of Superboy.&quot;

==Location==
Similar to the whereabouts of other fictional DC Universe cities, the location of Smallville was, originally, never specifically stated in the comics.

Smallville&#x27;s location varied widely throughout many stories, many of which placed Smallville close to Metropolis and Midvale, home of Supergirl. &quot;All-New Collectors&#x27; Edition #C-55&quot; (notable for featuring the wedding of Legion of Super-Heroes members Lightning Lad and Saturn Girl and published in 1978) calls Smallville &quot;a quiet town, nestled in the hills just inland from the eastern seaboard.&quot; Most sources since the 1986 John Byrne Superman origin reboot point the location of Smallville to be in Kansas.

===&quot;Superman Family&quot; #195===
In the Superboy story in &quot;Superman Family&quot; #195 (May–June 1979), Interstate 70 is shown as running through or near Smallville, as Lana and Clark drive along the highway. States the real-world Interstate 70 passes through include Utah, Colorado, Kansas (Smallville&#x27;s usual post-Crisis location), Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Maryland (cited in some pre-Crisis references as Smallville&#x27;s location).

===&quot;Amazing World of DC Comics&quot; #14===
In &quot;Amazing World of DC Comics&quot; #14 (1977), an officially sanctioned fanzine with articles on DC Comics characters and series, Smallville was stated to be in Maryland. The Maryland location was supported in the comics with a map of Smallville and the surrounding area that was published in &quot;New Adventures of Superboy&quot; #22 (October 1981), which situated Smallville a few miles west of a large bay very similar to Delaware Bay (the same map placed Metropolis and Gotham City on the east and west sides of the bay.

===&quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; volume 2 #313===
A map of Legion-era Metropolis included in &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (vol. 2) #313 (July 1984) indicates that Smallville was believed by the 1980s to be somewhere in northeastern Pennsylvania or northern New Jersey, while incorporated into Metropolis proper at that time as a historical district. In revisions of the map published after 1986, this was retroactively removed to accommodate changes of Smallville&#x27;s location in other titles, as detailed below.

===&quot;The Death and Life of Superman&quot; (novel)===
In the novel &quot;The Death and Life of Superman&quot; (1993), Jonathan and Martha Kent drive to Smallville from the Great Bend, Kansas, airport which would put Smallville somewhere in central Kansas.

===&quot;The Kents&quot;===
The 1990s limited series &quot;The Kents&quot; places Smallville in eastern Kansas, within approximately one day&#x27;s horse ride from Paola, Kansas, which is located in Miami County.

===&quot;Action Comics&quot; #822===
In &quot;Repo Man&quot; Pt. 1, Smallville is placed approximately 55 miles from Salina, Kansas, and in line with Junction City, giving it approximately the same location as Dorrance, Kansas.

===Smallville Season 11===
&quot;Smallville Season 11&quot; is the comic book sequel to the &quot;Smallville&quot; television series. This version of Smallville has a ZIP Code of 67524, which is the real world ZIP Code for Chase, Kansas. Although this Smallville is described as being about two hundred miles west of Wichita and southwest of Dodge City, placing it around Liberal, Kansas, while Chase is 73 miles Northwest of Wichita.

==In other media==
===Television===

* The &quot;Superboy&quot; TV series (1988–1992) also places Smallville in Kansas, stating it is where Clark and Lana grew up. The main action of that series takes place at the fictional Shuster University in Florida, named for Superman/Superboy&#x27;s co-creator, artist, Joe Shuster.
* &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; (1993–1997) places Smallville as a city in Kansas as well, though Metropolis is located on the east coast (or maybe in eastern Pennsylvania, it is never stated for sure) and Superman must fly between the two locations using his super-speed.
* Smallville was featured in &quot;&quot; (1996–2000). It was also in Kansas.
* In the television series &quot;Smallville&quot; (2001–2011), the town&#x27;s location is two hundred miles west of Wichita and southwest of Dodge City, implied by the series to be located in west Kansas. The skyline of Metropolis is visible from high points of Smallville on a clear day. Though some episodes reference an hours-long drive from Smallville to Metropolis, characters easily—and frequently—traverse between the two towns. The headquarters of LuthorCorp are in Metropolis, and a LutherCorp plant is located in Smallville. Smallville is famous for a meteor shower that hit the town in 1989, and for the lingering effects of the meteor rocks on the town and some of its citizens. The meteor shower was a cover for the spaceship that brought Clark Kent to Kansas. It was later revealed that the meteor shower also brought Davis Bloome, also known as Doomsday, to Earth as well. The second-season episode &quot;Lineage&quot; gives its ZIP Code as 67524, which is the real life code for Chase, Kansas.
* Smallville appears in the &quot;Young Justice: Invasion&quot; 2013 episode &quot;True Colors.&quot; Robin, Blue Beetle, Arsenal and Impulse go undercover in LexCorp Farms as tourists, and split off from the tour group halfway through the tour. They manage to procure a sample of the Reach&#x27;s additive, but on their way out, are confronted by Black Beetle. After Green Beetle joins the fight as well, the heroes regroup. At Jonathan Kent&#x27;s farm, Alpha Squad and Green Beetle meet up with Nightwing and Superboy. Lex Luthor and Vandal Savage discuss the damage done to the farms and conclude that the main production lines were never in any harm.

Eventually his parents revealed his alien origins after Clark used his powers to save his classmates on a flooding bus after it drove off a bridge. In 2013, General Zod and his Kryptonian forces entered Smallville in search of the growth codex. They confronted Martha Kent at her home before her son Clark Kent arrived to stop them, now wearing a blue alien superhero suit with a cape.

<doc id="98611" wikidata="Q89675" url="?curid=98611" title="Villages with fortified churches in Transylvania">
<text>The south-eastern Transylvania region in Romania currently has one of the highest numbers of existing fortified churches from the 13th to 16th centuries. It has more than 150 well preserved fortified churches of a great variety of architectural styles (out of an original 300 fortified churches).

Listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Villages with Fortified Churches in Transylvania are seven villages (six Saxon and one Székely) founded by the Transylvanian Saxons. They are dominated by fortified churches and characterized by a specific settlement pattern that has been preserved since the Late Middle Ages.

==The list==
The seven villages listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site:

==History==
The Saxon villages of Transylvania appeared in the twelfth century when the Kings of Hungary settled German colonists in the area. They had a special status among nations in the province and their civilisation managed to survive and thrive, forming a very strong community of farmers, artisans and merchants. Being situated in a region constantly under the threat of the Ottoman and Tatar invasions, they built fortifications of different sizes. The most important towns were fully fortified, and the smaller communities created fortifications centered on the church, where they added defensive towers and storehouses to keep their most valuable goods and to help them withstand long sieges.

==Description==

The topography in Southern Transylvania is that of a plateau, cut by wide valleys of various small rivers that flow into larger ones, namely the Olt River, Mureș River, Târnava Mare River and Târnava Mică River. The villages follow the topography closely and try to make the best of it; thus villages situated in a valley developed around a central street and possibly some secondary ones, while those situated on a flatter spot follow a looser, radial pattern. Due to security reasons and the traditions of the Saxon inhabitants, the villages are compact.

The main element is the church, always situated in the middle of the town. Different types of fortifications can be found: a small enceinte around the church, a row of fortifications around the church or a real fortress with multiple fortification walls centered on the church. The churches have been adapted to include defensive functions; all of them are either Romanesque basilicas or single-nave churches of the late Gothic period. The churches often include many additions, ranging in age from the original period in which the churches were built Late Middle Ages to the sixteenth century. Many churches also include baroque elements from that period, as the baroque style was very popular in the region.

In almost all cases, the church is situated in an easily defendable position, generally on a hilltop. Elements of fortifications found in the main cities in the area have been adapted here, and they are a testimony of the building techniques used along the years by the Saxon community. Some fortifications had observation towers, some of them being church towers adapted to the needs of a fortress. The materials are the traditional ones, stone and red bricks, with a red clay tiled roof, a typical feature of the area.

Close to the church there is the main square of the village or &quot;Tanzplaz&quot; (Dance Square) to which social life gravitated. The only buildings situated next to the fortifications are those of communal use: the school or the village hall. The parish house, along with the houses of the most wealthy villagers, were situated around this square. Also in most sites, barns for grain storage are situated close to the centre of the village.

<text>Iberia (), legally incorporated as &quot;Iberia Líneas Aéreas de España, S.A. Operadora, Sociedad Unipersonal&quot;, is the flag carrier of Spain. Founded in 1927 and based in Madrid, it operates an international network of services from its main base of Madrid–Barajas Airport.
Iberia, with Iberia Regional (operated by an independent carrier Air Nostrum) and with Iberia Express, is a part of International Airlines Group. In addition to transporting passengers and freight, Iberia Group carries out related activities, such as aircraft maintenance, handling in airports, IT systems and in-flight catering. Iberia Group airlines fly to over 109 destinations in 39 countries, and a further 90 destinations through code-sharing agreements with other airlines.

On 8 April 2010, it was confirmed that British Airways and Iberia had signed an agreement to merge, making the combined operation the third largest commercial airline in the world by revenue. Shareholders of both carriers approved the deal on 29 November 2010. The newly merged company, known as International Airlines Group (IAG), was established in January 2011, although both airlines continue to operate under their respective brands.

==History==



===Early years===
Iberia, Compañía Aérea de Transportes, was incorporated on 28 June 1927 with a capital investment of 1.1 million pesetas by financier Horacio Echevarrieta and Deutsche Luft Hansa. Flight operations commenced on 14 December 1927. The Spanish government contracted the company to provide postal transport between Madrid and Barcelona. During Miguel Primo de Rivera&#x27;s dictatorship, Spanish aviation companies were amalgamated and became state-controlled as a general interest public utility, starting early 1928. Consequently, Iberia was merged into CLASSA (Compañía de Líneas Aéreas Subvencionadas &quot;S.A.&quot;), ceasing independent operations on 29 May 1929. Although the airline had neither a fleet nor commercial operations under its brand, the name &#x27;Iberia&#x27; remained registered.

In 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, Spanish navy captain and director-general of the company Daniel de Araoz y Aréjula received the order from General Kindelán to organize an airline for the air transport in nationalist-held territory during the war. Daniel de Araoz y Aréjula traveled to Germany to get support and material for the restoration of the company as an independent airline, thus six Junkers Ju 52 from Deutsche Luft Hansa arrived, which were acquired by Iberia at the end of the conflict, in addition to material to help the operations. As the name &quot;Iberia&quot; was still registered, it was used when operations began in 1937 towards the end of the war. During the conflict Iberia was a purely domestic airline, with headquarters in Salamanca the airline operated flights to cities in the nationalist side, Spanish North Africa, Spanish West Africa and Morocco. After the war, at the end of the 1930s, the airline served the Seville–Larache–Cabo Juby–Las Palmas, Barcelona–Saragosa–Burgos–Salamanca–Seville–Tetuan and Palma–Barcelona–Vitoria runs using Junkers Ju 52 aircraft. On 1 May 1939, Iberia operated its first regular service to an international destination as an independent civil airline with a Madrid–Lisbon flight.

In 1940, the government gave the monopoly of national air transport to Iberia (this fact changed 6 years later when the government liberalized the national air traffic for the private airlines), This privilege helped the company to start building as an important international airline, which had not been until then. The airline was nationalised on 30 September 1944 and became part of Instituto Nacional de Industria. The policy of the company was to separate itself from the German orbit to which it had been linked in its first years and establish relations with the United States in terms of aircraft purchase and supplies of aeronautical material for the operation. Thus that year the purchase of seven DC-3 and three DC-4 was finalized, to expand the network in Europe and accomplish the company&#x27;s first transatlantic flight. This was achieved in 1946, Iberia was the first airline to fly between Europe and South America after World War II, using a Douglas DC-4 to operate flights between Madrid and Buenos Aires. This flight was the first of an expansion of flights between Latin America and Europe through Spain carried out by the company, with destinations such as San Juan de Puerto Rico, Caracas, Ciudad de México and La Habana. The poor diplomatic relations of the Francoist regime delayed the establishment of some destinations until the beginning of the 1950s.

Iberia incorporated four more DC-4s into its fleet during the first half of 1950, enabling both the strengthening of current services and the launch of new ones. With the Pact of Madrid in 1953, visa requirements were eliminated for US visitors to Spain. This stimulated the start of transatlantic flights between Spain and the United States the following year. The airline phased in the first of three Super Constellations in June 1954. The aircraft was named &quot;Santa María&quot; to commemorate Columbus&#x27; first voyage and was deployed in the inauguration of the new Madrid–New York service two months later, on 3 August 1954, the same day that Columbus left the port of Palos de la Frontera. The amendments to Article 6 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation of 14 June 1954 made in Paris on 30 June 1956 about non-scheduled air services enabled mass tourism using chartered aircraft since allowing European member states to carry out this type of operation with international flights between their territories. This favored the airline given that it had in its territory several highly sought after destinations, mainly those on the eastern and southern Mediterranean coast and in the Balearic and Canary Islands, highly demanded by seaside tourism which began with this type of operation.

In 1959, the Spanish airline Aviaco became a part of Iberia by controlling two-thirds of its capital in a capital increase. Aviaco had been created in 1948, after the national air traffic had been liberalized for Spanish private companies in 1946.

In 1961, Iberia had 9 Super Constellation in the fleet, that year came into service the first DC-8-50, the four-engined jet airliner was progressively incorporated until reaching the number of 8 aircraft of the 50 series variant. Iberia was gradually incorporating jets of short and middle range, such as Sud Aviation Caravelle, and Douglas DC-9. The Super Constellations were removed and sold in 1966 and, two years later, three DC-8-63 with more seat capacity were incorporated into the fleet. By 1969, the long-range fleet of Iberia was composed of 11 DC-8s. In the early 1970s the jumbo jets Boeing 747s and Douglas DC-10s came to the company during an expansion of the intercontinental routes, especially to Central America. By the middle of this decade, the airline flew to almost all Latin American capitals. 
With the expansion in Latin America the company had followed a policy of purchasing shares and establishing agreements with several Latin American airlines such as Compañia Dominicana de Aviación, Aérolíneas Peruanas, PLUNA and Air Panamá Internacional. At first, the intention of this policy could be to create a strong distribution network for intercontinental routes passengers, but as the airline was controlled by the state the Franco regime used this investment policy to get support in Latin America. Iberia gave material, capital and logistical support to those flag-carrier airlines. By 1971, these investments resulted in the loss of 14 million dollars. Iberia also bought the short-middle range trijet Boeing 727-200 in 1971, of which the company had 35 aircraft and was used until 2001 like the other short-range jet bought by the company in the late &#x27;60s, the Douglas DC-9.

In 1987, Iberia, together with Lufthansa, Air France and SAS Group, founded Amadeus, an IT company (also known as a Global Distribution System) that would enable travel agencies to sell the founders and other airlines&#x27; products from a single system. In the same year, Iberia planned a fleet renewal in the middle-range fleet with the McDonnell Douglas MD-87 and Airbus A320 replacing the Douglas DC-9 and Boeing 727 respectively. In June 1990, the carrier bought 16 Boeing 757s for  billion, including spares and training; twelve more aircraft of the type were taken on option as a part of the deal.

===Development since the 1990s===
In the 1990s, Iberia followed a policy of buying shares of Latin American flag carriers. It intended to dominate the entire Latin American market and become one of the largest airlines on the worldwide scene.

The investments started in June 1990 with the buying of a 30% stake in Aerolineas Argentinas. In 1991 Iberia bought a 45% stake in Viasa for $81 million and a 35% stake in Chilean Ladeco. The airline continued making progress in setting up Europe&#x27;s first international airline frequent-flyer programme in 1991, with the creation of &quot;Iberia Plus.&quot;

In 1994, the poor results of Aerolineas Argentinas, which presented a positive balance in its commercial exploitation but hid a significant deficit with losses in non-operating activities, led Iberia to increase its ownership participation to 85%. With this increase in participation, the Argentine state renounced its &quot;golden share&quot;, allowing Iberia to have full fiscal control of the company. Iberia began a reduction in the size of the company, a liquidation of the national and overseas offices, and the technical sale of its entire fleet composed of 28 aircraft in a &quot;sale and lease back&quot; operation. Argentine sources indicate that the purchase capital of Aerolíneas Argentinas was charged to its financial liability. This, together with the aforementioned sales, generated a big controversy, giving rise to criticism of the Argentine government for the privatization of the company. The truth is that during the period that Aerolíneas Argentinas was owned by Iberia (1990–1995), the Spanish airline allocated more than 1,200 million dollars to the Argentine flag carrier and kept the airline operating despite the poor results. Meanwhile, the Argentine government refused to invest more capital and expressed its desire to get rid of a large part of its shares. Iberia carried out major reforms in the structure of the company, which by that date was outdated with, among other things, extortionate personnel costs. Some of these changes included the development of a free booking program, the complete computerization of the management system, the introduction of business class on domestic flights, and the creation of a new hub in Ezeiza International Airport for long range regional flights to Latin American destinations. In 1995, before the process of privatization of Iberia, Aerolineas Argentinas was transferred to the Spanish government through INI, which would later become SEPI. In 2001, the Argentine flag carrier was sold to the Spanish company Grupo Marsans.

In 2008, the president of Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner expropriated the company from Grupo Marsans for the symbolic price of 1 Argentine peso ($0.57) and renationalized the airline. In July 2017 the ICSID ordered Argentina to pay 320 million dollars to Grupo Marsans for having paid a lower price than the real value of the company. On 7 April 2010, the president of the Spanish Court of Auditors presented at the Spanish Parliament the figures of the investment in Aerolíneas Argentinas between 1990 and 2001, which was estimated at €2,100 million.

The plans to make the Iberia group the dominant airline in the Latin American market also failed in Venezuela. In 1997 the board of directors of Viasa, in which Iberia was the majority, decided to suspend the flights of the company, arguing that the situation was unfeasible. Iberia announcing that the company was not going to continue providing more capital into Viasa if its local partner, the Venezuelan state-owned group FIV, was not going to do the same. By then Iberia had invested more than 250 million dollars in the Venezuelan flag carrier without having any profit. In February 1997, the agreement for the liquidation of Viasa that accumulated a 200 million dollar debt, with a capital of only 2 million dollars, was announced. Iberia and the Venezuelan government had the intention of liquidating the company to avoid bankruptcy. Iberia offered to write off the 150 million dollar debt that Viasa had accumulated to the Spanish carrier in exchange for keeping its fleet of four DC-10s and five Boeing 727s. The agreement included compensation for the staff after the liquidation, which had a cost of 20 million dollars.

Regarding Ladeco, Iberia was a minority shareholder (35%) and did not intervene in its management. Initially, Iberia had the intention of achieving the merger of Ladeco with Lan Chile, but Chilean antitrust laws prevented it. Later, in 1995, LAN Chile made a major acquisition of Ladeco shares and acquired 57.6% of the company, this operation was approved by the Chilean antitrust prosecution, and then began a merger process in which Iberia lost some rights acquired during its time as shareholder of Ladeco. In 1997, Iberia sold its shares in Ladeco.

In 1996, the airline launched its website.

The company ordered 76 aircraft from Airbus in February 1998, which at the time was the largest single Airbus order. The following year it bought Aviaco and inherited that airline&#x27;s fleet.

By the end of the &#x27;90s, Iberia owned as majority shareholder the Spanish airlines Aviaco, Viva Air, Binter Canarias and Binter Mediterráneo, and Latin American airlines Aerolíneas Argentinas, Austral, Viasa and Ladeco.

During 2001, Iberia was privatised and its shares were listed on stock exchanges. By 2002, when Iberia celebrated its 75th anniversary, it had carried nearly 500 million people in its history. In July 2004, Iberia announced it had decided to move its Latin American hub from Miami, Florida to San Pedro Sula, Honduras.

On 5 February 2006, Terminal 4 at Madrid - Barajas Airport was turned over to Iberia and fellow Oneworld alliance members. This provided much-needed expansion capabilities for Iberia. Iberia represents around 60% of the airport&#x27;s traffic. In 2005, the airline and its regional branch Air Nostrum transported 21,619,041 passengers via Madrid – Barajas Airport.

In November 2006, Iberia launched Clickair, a low-cost carrier subsidiary. Clickair merged with Vueling in 2009.

On 12 November 2009, Iberia confirmed that it had reached a preliminary agreement to merge with British Airways. The merger between the two carriers would create the world&#x27;s third-largest airline in terms of revenue. On 8 April 2010, it was confirmed that British Airways and Iberia had agreed to a merger, forming the International Airlines Group, although each airline would continue to operate under its current brand.

In November 2012, Iberia announced plans to reduce the number of employees by 4,500 and its fleet by five long-haul and 20 short-haul aircraft.

In 2012, Iberia established another low-cost airline, Iberia Express, which operates short and medium-haul routes from its parent airline&#x27;s Madrid hub, providing feeder flights onto Iberia&#x27;s long-haul network. The airline began operating on 25 March 2012 and shares its head office with Iberia in Chamartín, Madrid. In 2013, the headquarters of both airlines were moved to a new office in Ciudad Lineal, Madrid, and the corporate images have been changed as part of the renewal process.

In 2023, Iberia announced its return to Tokyo&#x27;s Narita International Airport in October 2024 following its withdrawal in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Iberia first started flights to Tokyo in 1986, and began nonstop flying in 1992, but had previously suspended flights between 1998 and 2016.

==Corporate affairs==
=== Business trends ===
The key trends for Iberia are (as of the financial year ending 31 December):
===Head office===

The company head office is in the MV49 Business Park in Madrid. This facility is in proximity to the intersection of the &quot;Autopista de Circunvalación M-30&quot; and &quot;Avenida de América&quot;. In 2013 the company moved its head office from the former &quot;Campos Velázquez&quot;, in the Salamanca district of Madrid, to save money.

===Ownership===
On 3 April 2001, Iberia was privatised and included in the IBEX 35 stock index of the Madrid stock exchange. The core shareholders were: Caja Madrid– 23.45%, British Airways 13.2%, SEPI– 5.20%, El Corte Inglés– 2.90%. British Airways raised its stake in Iberia by purchasing American Airlines&#x27; remaining shares, reportedly paying £13m for the small shareholding. This increased BA&#x27;s total stake in Iberia to around 10% and preserved its two seats on the Iberia board.

In July 2008, British Airways and Iberia announced plans to merge, wherein each airline would retain its original brand. The agreement was confirmed in April 2010, and in July, the European Commission and United States Department of Transportation permitted the merger and the two airlines began to co-ordinate transatlantic routes with American Airlines. On 6 October 2010, the alliance between British Airways, American Airlines and Iberia formally began operations. At the time it was estimated the alliance would generate an estimated £230 million in annual cost-saving for BA, in addition to the £330 million which would be saved by the merger with Iberia. The merger was finalised on 21 January 2011, resulting in the International Airlines Group (IAG), the world&#x27;s third-largest airline in terms of annual revenue and the second-largest airline group in Europe.

Prior to merging, British Airways owned a 13.5% stake in Iberia, and thus received ownership of 55% of the combined International Airlines Group; Iberia&#x27;s other shareholders received the remaining 45%.

The merger has been controversial. British Airways operates two funded principal-defined benefit pension schemes in the UK. British Airways admits that one of the most serious financial risks it suffers is the challenging pension schemes&#x27; combined deficit. The last actuarial valuation was £3.7 billion, a value even greater than IAG&#x27;s capitalisation. In addition and according to the &quot;Pensions Act&quot; for the year 2004, should it be necessary, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Pension Regulator could force Iberia or IAG to give additional financial support to British Airways&#x27; retirement pension schemes. In its &quot;Annual Report and Accounts Year ended 31 December 2011&quot; BA declared that &quot;negative movements in pension asset values and financial returns from these assets may increase the size of the pension deficit&quot;.

, the airline had over 18,000 employees.

Due to Brexit, Iberia has been forced to prove that it is still a Spanish airline, despite being merged with British Airways. The consequence for not doing so is their potential inability to fly within the European Union.

===Subsidiaries and alliances===
Iberia has a 9.49% stake in low-cost carrier Vueling which is based near Barcelona, with parent company IAG owning the remaining 90.51%. This was done to ensure that IAG does not have 100% of the shares in Vueling, but that the shares are split between its divisions. Iberia also has a 0.95% share in Royal Air Maroc.

Iberia is allied with American Airlines, Qantas, Avianca and British Airways, and it was allied with Grupo TACA. On 1 September 1999, the company joined the Oneworld alliance.

Iberia formerly owned Aviaco, which operated most domestic routes. It was founded on 18 February 1948 and operated until 1 September 1999. Iberia also owned Binter Canarias, until the Spanish government began the privatisation of the subsidiary. Hesperia Inversiones Aéreas bought the airline from Iberia in July 2002. A second airline using the Binter name, Binter Mediterraneo, was formed as a subsidiary of Iberia in 1988 with routes from Melilla to Málaga, Almeria, Valencia and in its last year, with Madrid. The airline was acquired by Air Nostrum in 1998 and merged into its operations, at that time the airline had a fleet of CN- 235.

Iberia was a founding partner in the computerised air ticket reservation system, Amadeus, with an 18.28% stake . Iberia is also active as a tour operator through its Viva Tours and Tiempo Libre units, and with Cacesa, it supplies parcel shipment services.

In addition, Iberia is an aircraft maintenance company, servicing its fleet and those of another 48 companies, including some leading European airlines. Iberia is a supplier of aircraft handling services at all Spanish airports and two in Equatorial Guinea; its airline clients number more than 200 and has 7300 employees.

==Aircraft cabins==
All aircraft in the fleet are configured in a two-class layout with Business and Economy cabins. Iberia currently markets three distinct business class variations, depending on flight length. In March 2009, Iberia announced that between 2009–2011 it would renovate its economy class on all its planes as well as design a new business class for its long-haul planes. Iberia was one of the last remaining major airlines to equip all of its intercontinental routes with personal entertainment screens. , the Airbus A330-200 and −300, and A340-600 fleets are equipped with personal IFE. In-flight catering is provided by Do &amp; Co.

;Business Class
Business Class is available on Spanish domestic and inter-European flights. Seats are the same as in the economy cabin but with the middle (B and E) seats blocked off. Business Class tickets also include improved ground service (priority check-in, security, boarding, baggage handling, and lounge access).

;Business Plus
Business Plus is offered on long-haul flights to the Americas and Southern Africa. Business Plus offers lie-flat seating and international business-class amenities.

;Economy
Iberia has moved more to an American, or &quot;a-la-carte&quot; model for domestic and European flights, offering a buy on board service called &quot;Tu Menú&quot; in economy for meals, snacks and beverages. Mid-haul flights to Dakar, Moscow, and Tel Aviv as well as long-haul intercontinental flights are fully catered in Economy except alcohol.

==Accidents and incidents==

, a total of 37 aircraft operated by or for Iberia have been written off in accidents and shoot-downs since 1939. Several Iberia aircraft have also been hijacked. These incidents and accidents include the following:
*On 19 April 1928, a Rohrbach Ro VIII Roland I with registration D-1219 made a hard landing near Ventas de Muniesa, 12 km north of Muniesa, Teruel which resulted in serious damage to the aircraft and caused injuries to the 11 occupants, one of them severely and later died. According to witnesses, there were foggy conditions in the area and the plane had given several low passes around the place before landing. The aircraft was flying from Barcelona to Madrid.
*During 1939, Iberia lost two trimotor Junkers Ju 52s. On 16 March, one crashed due to bad weather in Cabezavellosa on the regular flight from Salamanca to Seville. On 18 December, another Ju 52 was mistakenly shot down by British anti-aircraft fire as it passed over Gibraltar on its flight from Tetuán to Seville, when it was mistaken for a German aircraft (the German military used large numbers of Ju 52s in World War II). Three crew and seven passengers were killed.
*On 23 December 1948, a Douglas DC-3 crashed in foggy and heavy rain conditions in risk of Sierra de Pandols near Bot killing all 27 occupants.

The Spantax Convair 990 was able to make a successful emergency landing whilst the Iberia DC-9 crashed killing everyone on board. The accident occurred during a French air traffic controllers&#x27; strike.
*On 17 December 1973, Flight 933, an Iberia McDonnell Douglas DC-10 registered as EC-CBN, collided with an ALS system of the runway threshold upon landing at Boston Logan after a flight from Madrid Airport.

<text>The Danube Delta (, ; , ) is the second largest river delta in Europe, after the Volga Delta, and is the best preserved on the continent. Occurring where the Danube River empties into the Black Sea, most of the Danube Delta lies in Romania (Tulcea County), with a small part located in Ukraine (Odesa Oblast). Its approximate surface area is , of which is in Romania. With the lagoons of Razim–Sinoe ( with water surface), located south of the main delta, the total area of the Danube Delta is . The Razim–Sinoe lagoon complex is geologically and ecologically related to the delta proper; the combined territory is listed as a World Heritage Site.
==Geography and geology==

The modern Danube Delta began to form after 4000 BC in a bay of the Black Sea when the sea rose to its present level. A sandy barrier blocked the Danube bay where the river initially built its delta. Upon filling the bay with sediment, the delta advanced outside this barrier-blocked estuary after 3500 BC, building several successive lobes: the St. George I (3500–1600 BC), the Sulina (1600–0 BC), the St. George II (0 BC–present) and the Chilia or Kilia (1600 AD–present). Several other internal lobes were constructed in the lakes and lagoons bordering the Danube Delta to the north (Chilia I and II) and toward the south (Dunavatz). Much of the alluvium in the delta and major expansion of its surface area in the form of lobes resulted from soil erosion associated with human clearing of forests in the Danube basin during the 1st and 2nd millennium. Geologist Liviu Giosan told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: 
Probably 40 percent of the Delta was built in the last 1000 years. Finding that was like a eureka moment.

At present, the delta suffers from a large sediment deficit, after the construction of dams on the Danube and its tributaries in the later half of the 20th century. Construction of a dense network of shallow channels in the delta over the same period, a sedimentation enhancing strategy, attenuated the deficit on the delta plain but increased erosion along the coast. The Danube Delta is a low alluvial plain, mostly covered by wetlands and water. It consists of an intricate pattern of marshes, channels, streamlets and lakes. The average altitude is 0.52 m, with 20% of the territory below sea level, and more than half not exceeding one meter in altitude. Dunes on the most extensive strand plains of the delta (Letea and Caraorman strand plains) stand higher (12.4 m and 7 m respectively). The largest lakes are lakes Dranov (21.7km2), Roșu (14.5km2) and Gorgova (13.8km2).
=== Distributaries of the Danube ===

The Danube branches into three main distributaries into the delta, Chilia, Sulina, and Sfântul Gheorghe (Saint George). The last two branches form the Tulcea channel, which continues as a single body for several kilometers after the separation from the Chilia. At the mouths of each channel gradual formation of new land takes place, as the delta continues to expand.

Chilia, in the north, the longest, youngest, and most vigorous, with two secondary internal deltas and one microdelta in full process of formation at its mouth (to Ukraine).

Sulina, the central and thus the shortest arm, which consequently led to its extensive use for traffic and severe transformation. At its mouth is located the main port and a single settlement with urban characteristics of the Romanian part of the delta. Because of the alluvium deposited at its mouth, a channel gradually advancing into the sea (presently it has 10km) was built in order to protect navigation.

Sfântul Gheorghe (Saint George in English), in the south, is the oldest and most sparsely populated. Its alluvium has led to the creation, beginning in 1897, of the Sacalin Islands, which today measures 19km in length.

=== Climate ===

The Danube Delta is considered to be among Romania&#x27;s sunniest and driest regions. The mean annual temperature is 11°C (−1°C in January and 22 °C in July), with mean precipitation between 400mm/year and 300mm/year. 

=== Main ecosystems ===

The Danube Delta falls within the Pannonian steppe ecosystem of eastern Europe, with Mediterranean influences. As a young region in full process of consolidation, the Danube Delta represents a very favourable place for the development of highly diverse flora and fauna, unique in Europe, with numerous rare species. It hosts 23 natural ecosystems, but due to the extent of wetlands an aquatic environment is prevalent; a terrestrial environment is also present on the higher grounds of the continental levees, where xerophile ecosystems have developed. Between the aquatic and terrestrial environments is interposed a swampy, easily flooded strip of original flora and fauna, with means of adaptation to water or land, depending on the season or hydrological regime. At the contact between freshwater and sea water, some special physical, chemical and biological processes take place, which have led biologists to consider this area as a very different ecosystem called beforedelta. Musura Gulf, north of Sulina, and Saint George Gulf are considered the most representative of this type of ecosystem.

Situated on major migratory routes, and providing adequate conditions for nesting and hatching, the Danube Delta is a magnet for birds from six major ecoregions of the world, including the Mongolian, Arctic and Siberian. There are over 320 species of birds found in the delta during summer, of which 166 are hatching species and 159 are migratory. Over one million individual birds (including swans, ducks, and coots) winter here.

==== Ecosystem of running water ====

This comprises the arms of the Danube, and a series of its more important streamlets and channels. It is an environment rich in plankton, worms, molluscs, grubs, and sponges, with numerous species of fish, such as the carp, pike, pike perch, sheat-fish, and freshwater sturgeons (sterlet, Vyza and Danube mackerel).

==== Ecosystem of stagnant water ====

This environment includes the lakes, and various ponds, streamlets and channels. It is characterized by a rich floating and submerse flora (&quot;Myriophyllum&quot;, &quot;Ceratophyllum&quot;, &quot;Vallisneria&quot;, under the water; &quot;Nymphaea alba&quot;, &quot;Nuphar lutea&quot;, &quot;Trapa natans&quot;, &quot;Alisma plantago&quot;, floating plants with roots near the lakes&#x27; borders; and &quot;Salvinia natans&quot;, &quot;Stratiotes aloides&quot;, &quot;Spirogyra&quot;, floating plants without roots, having negative effect for aquatic bioproductivity). Of the fish, the most important are Tench (&quot;Tinca tinca&quot;), common bream (&quot;Abramis brama&quot;), common rudd (&quot;Scardinius erythropthalmus&quot;), Prussian carp (&quot;Carassius auratus gibelio&quot;), wels catfish (&quot;Silurus glanis&quot;), European perch (&quot;Perca fluviatilis&quot;), and northern pike (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;).

==== Ecosystem of marshy and flooding areas ====

Reed plants and floating reed islands (called plaur in Romania) are the most common and well-known components of the Danube Delta. Vegetation of this ecosystem consists of the common reed (&quot;Phragmites communis&quot;) and, on near river banks, mace reed/cattail (&quot;Typha latifolia&quot;, &quot;Typha angustifolia&quot;), sedge (&quot;Carex dioica&quot;, &quot;Carex stricta&quot;), Dutch rush (&quot;Scirpus radicans&quot;, &quot;Schoenoplectus lacustris&quot;), and brook mint (&quot;Mentha aquatica&quot;). They provide ideal spawning and nesting grounds. The plaur are a mixture of reed roots, grass and soil, usually floating or anchored to the riverbed. As a rule, the reed surrounds the lakes and ponds, and slowly invades the water surface.

This type of ecosystem is noted for its variety and large population of birds, some of them are very rare. The most important are the tufted duck (&quot;Aythya fuligula&quot;), red-crested pochard (&quot;Netta rufina&quot;), mallard (&quot;Anas platyrhynchos&quot;), greylag goose (&quot;Anser anser&quot;), pygmy cormorant (&quot;Microcarbo pygmeus&quot;), purple heron (&quot;Ardea purpurea&quot;), great white egret (&quot;Egretta alba&quot;), little egret (&quot;Egretta garzetta&quot;), Eurasian spoonbill(&quot;Platalea leucorodia&quot;), great white pelican (&quot;Pelecanus onocrotalus&quot;), Dalmatian pelican (&quot;Pelecanus crispus&quot;), mute swan (&quot;Cygnus olor&quot;), and glossy ibis (&quot;Plegadis falcinellus&quot;). A recent and welcomed newcomer is the pheasant (&quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot;).

Among the mammals, there is the Eurasian otter (&quot;Lutra lutra&quot;), European mink (&quot;Mustela lutreola&quot;), little ermine (&quot;Mustela erminea aestiva&quot;), wild boar (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;), and wild cat (&quot;Felis silvestris&quot;), in winter the European hare (&quot;Lepus europaeus&quot;) and, on the brink of disappearing from the delta, the wolf and the fox. During the Middle Ages, the Caspian tiger (&quot;Panthera tigris tigris&quot;) was a resident across the steppes of Ukraine, including Danube Delta, and once, they were hunted to extinction and they&#x27;re extirpated. The East Asian raccoon dog (&quot;Nyctereutes procyonoides&quot;), bizam/introduced muskrat (&quot;Ondatra zibethica&quot;), and to some extent South American nutria (&quot;Myocastor coypus&quot;), are recent species that have successfully adapted.

==== River bank and levee ecosystems ====
The firm land of the delta used to be covered with large groves of willow trees, which have been cut down almost entirely and replaced with Canadian poplars. On the river banks kept in their natural state, small groves of willow trees (&quot;Salix alba&quot;, &quot;Salix fragilis&quot;, &quot;Salix purpurea&quot;, &quot;Salix pentandra&quot;, and &quot;Salix triandra&quot;) can still be found, mixed with white poplar (&quot;Populus alba&quot;). Occasionally, the willow trees form corridors along the arms and bigger channels of the Danube. On the levees of Letea and Caraorman, mixed forests of oaks (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;, and &quot;Quercus pedunculiflora&quot;) with various other trees (&quot;Fraxinus pallisiae&quot;, &quot;Ulmus foliaceae&quot;, &quot;Populus tremula&quot;), shrubs (&quot;Prunus spinosa&quot;, &quot;Crataegus monogyna&quot;, &quot;Rosa canina&quot;, and &quot;Berberis vulgaris&quot;, among others), and vines (&quot;Vitis sylvestris&quot;, &quot;Hedera helix&quot;, &quot;Humulus lupulus&quot;, &quot;Periploca graeca&quot;, which reaches up to 25m) grow on sand dune areas. On the Letea levee, these exotic-looking forests grow especially in the depressions between the sand dunes, in small groves called hasmace. Fauna of this region include the meadow viper (&quot;Vipera ursinii&quot;), osprey (&quot;Pandion haliaetus&quot;), and Eurasian eagle owl (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;).

==Inhabitants==


With an average population density of 2 people per km2, the Danube Delta is one of the least inhabited regions of temperate Europe. On the Romanian side live about 20,000 people, of whom 4,600 live in the port of Sulina.. The rest of the population is scattered among 27 villages, of which only three, all situated marginally, had more than 500 people in 2002. The city of Tulcea, at the western edge of the delta, has a population of 65,624 as of 2021; it represents the node of the region and the gate to the delta.

Its acute isolation and harsh conditions of living, based mainly on subsistence, made the Danube Delta a place of emigration, or transit at least. Very few of those born in the region stay there through adulthood; at the same time, the origins of its inhabitants vary widely, as people from many parts of Romania can be found in the delta. The total population has remained more or less constant throughout the 20th century; there were 12,000 inhabitants in the 1890s, and 14,000 before the Second World War. Romanians account for approximately 80% of the population, and Ukrainians for 10%. Other people living in the delta include ethnic minorities such as Greeks, Turks and Bulgarians (in 1992). Distinctive to the region, but very rare as an ethnic entity, are the Lipovans, descendants of the Orthodox Old Rite followers who fled from religious persecution in Russia during the 18th century.

On the Ukrainian side, located at the northern edge of the delta, the town of Izmail has a population of 85,000, Kiliya a population of 21,800, and Vilkovo, the main center of the Lipovan community, a population of 9,300.

==History==
Recorded history notes that the Dacians lived in the Danube Delta before it was conquered by the Romans. After later invasion by the Goths, the region changed hands many times. During the 15th century, the Danube Delta became part of the Ottoman Empire. In 1812, following the Russo-Turkish War, the borders of the Ottoman and Russian Empires were set by the Kilia and Old Stambul Channels of the Danube, and in 1829 by the St George Channel. The Treaty of Paris of 1856, which ended the Crimean War, assigned the Danube Delta to the Ottoman Empire and established an international commission which undertook a series of works to help navigation. In 1878, following the defeat of Ottoman Empire by Russia and Romania, the border between the two countries was set by the Kilia and Old Stambul Channels.

In 1991, the Romanian part of the Danube Delta became part of UNESCO&#x27;s list of World Heritage Sites. Around 2,733km2 of the delta are strictly protected areas.

In 1998, under UNESCO&#x27;s Programme on Man and the Biosphere, the 6,264.03km2 of the Danube Delta were established as a biosphere reserve, shared by Romania and Ukraine.

Historically, in Romania, part of the Danube Delta was marked as a reserve in 1938.

In Ukraine, the Danube branch of the Black Sea State Reserve was established in 1973. In 1981, it was reorganized into the Natural Reserve &quot;Danube Fluxes&quot;, and in 1998, it was extended into the Danube biosphere reserve.

== Environmental issues ==
Large-scale works began in the Danube Delta as early as the second half of the 19th century. First corrections of the Sulina arm began in 1862, and they continued throughout the 20th century. As a result, the length of the Sulina arm was reduced from 92 to 64 km, and its flow more than doubled, thus making it suitable for large-vessel navigation. Correcting the six large meanders on its course thereby reduced the length of the Sfântu Gheorghe branch from 108 to 70km, and its flow also increased somewhat. Both these increases were made to the detriment of the Chilia arm, which at present remains the most unspoiled arm of the main three. These corrections, as well as the digging of various secondary channels throughout the body of the delta, have had a serious impact on the ecosystem. Natural environments have been altered, the breeding pattern of fish has been disrupted, and the flows in the main arms have increased, with serious consequences regarding the discharge of alluvia and the erosion of banks.

Reed was intensively harvested during the Communist era. The regime had plans to transform the delta into a large agro-industrial zone. Although the first modern agricultural exploitation dates from 1939 (Ostrovul Tãtaru), only after 1960 were large areas drained and converted, to the detriment of the wetlands. In 1991, agricultural land in the delta surpassed 100,000 hectares, and more than a third of its surface has been affected by crop cultivation, forest plantation, or pisciculture (fish farming). As a result of these changes, along with the increasing pollution and eutrophication of the waters of the Danube, and decades of exploitation and poor fishing regulations, the fish population has been visibly reduced.

In 2004, Ukraine inaugurated work on the Bistroe Channel that would provide an additional navigable link from the Black Sea to the populous Ukrainian section of the Danube Delta. However, because of the negative impact which this new channel might have on the fragile ecosystem of the delta, the European Union advised Ukraine to shut down the works. Romanian officials threatened to sue Ukraine at the International Court of Justice. Under the presidency of Kuchma, Ukraine had responded that Romania was only afraid of the competition that the new channel would bring, and continued working on the channel. Under the presidency of Yuschenko, who visited Romania in 2005, both sides agree that professionals should decide the fate of the channel. In the long run, Ukraine plans to build a navigation channel, if not through Bistroe Channel, then through another channel.

<text>The National Gallery is an art museum in Trafalgar Square in the City of Westminster, in Central London, England. Founded in 1824, it houses a collection of more than 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900. The current director of the National Gallery is Gabriele Finaldi.

The National Gallery is an exempt charity, and a non-departmental public body of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Its collection belongs to the government on behalf of the British public, and entry to the main collection is free of charge.

Unlike comparable museums in continental Europe, the National Gallery was not formed by nationalising an existing royal or princely art collection. It came into being when the British government bought 38 paintings from the heirs of John Julius Angerstein in 1824. After that initial purchase, the gallery was shaped mainly by its early directors, especially Charles Lock Eastlake, and by private donations, which now account for two-thirds of the collection. The collection is smaller than many European national galleries, but encyclopaedic in scope; most major developments in Western painting &quot;from Giotto to Cézanne&quot; are represented with important works. It used to be claimed that this was one of the few national galleries that had all its works on permanent exhibition, but this is no longer the case.

The present building, the third site to house the National Gallery, was designed by William Wilkins. Building began in 1832 and it opened to the public in 1838. Only the façade onto Trafalgar Square remains essentially unchanged from this time, as the building has been expanded piecemeal throughout its history. Wilkins&#x27;s building was often criticised for the perceived weaknesses of its design and for its lack of space; the latter problem led to the establishment of the Tate Gallery for British art in 1897. The Sainsbury Wing, a 1991 extension to the west by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, is a significant example of Postmodernist architecture in Britain.

==History==

===The call for a National Gallery===
The late 18th century saw the nationalisation of royal or princely art collections across mainland Europe. The Bavarian royal collection (now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich) opened to the public in 1779, that of the Medici in Florence around 1789 (as the Uffizi Gallery), and the Museum Français at the Louvre was formed out of the former French royal collection in 1793. Great Britain, however, did not follow other European countries, and the British Royal Collection still remains in the sovereign&#x27;s possession. In 1777, the British government had the opportunity to buy an art collection of international stature, when the descendants of Sir Robert Walpole put his collection up for sale. The MP John Wilkes argued for the government to buy this &quot;invaluable treasure&quot; and suggested that it be housed in &quot;a noble gallery... to be built in the spacious garden of the British Museum&quot;. Nothing came of Wilkes&#x27;s appeal and 20 years later the collection was bought in its entirety by Catherine the Great; it is now to be found in the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.

A plan to acquire 150 paintings from the Orléans collection, which had been brought to London for sale in 1798, also failed, despite the interest of both the King and the Prime Minister, Pitt the Younger. The twenty-five paintings from that collection now in the gallery, including &quot;NG1&quot;, arrived later by a variety of routes. In 1799, the dealer Noël Desenfans offered a ready-made national collection to the British government; he and his partner Sir Francis Bourgeois had assembled it for the king of Poland, before the Third Partition in 1795 abolished Polish independence. This offer was declined and Bourgeois bequeathed the collection to his old school, Dulwich College, on his death. The collection opened in 1814 in Britain&#x27;s first purpose-built public gallery, the Dulwich Picture Gallery. The Scottish dealer William Buchanan and the collector Joseph Count Truchsess both formed art collections expressly as the basis for a future national collection, but their respective offers (both made in 1803) were also declined.

Following the Walpole sale many artists, including James Barry and John Flaxman, had made renewed calls for the establishment of a National Gallery, arguing that a British school of painting could only flourish if it had access to the canon of European painting. The British Institution, founded in 1805 by a group of aristocratic connoisseurs, attempted to address this situation. The members lent works to exhibitions that changed annually, while an art school was held in the summer months. However, as the paintings that were lent were often mediocre, some artists resented the Institution and saw it as a racket for the gentry to increase the sale prices of their Old Master paintings. One of the Institution&#x27;s founding members, Sir George Beaumont, Bt, would eventually play a major role in the National Gallery&#x27;s foundation by offering a gift of 16 paintings.

In 1823, another major art collection came on the market, which had been assembled by the recently deceased John Julius Angerstein. Angerstein was a Russian-born émigré banker based in London; his collection numbered 38 paintings, including works by Raphael and Hogarth&#x27;s &quot;Marriage A-la-Mode&quot; series. On 1 July 1823, George Agar-Ellis, a Whig politician, proposed to the House of Commons that it purchase the collection. The appeal was given added impetus by Beaumont&#x27;s offer, which came with two conditions: that the government buy the Angerstein collection, and that a suitable building was to be found. The unexpected repayment of a war debt by Austria finally moved the government to buy Angerstein&#x27;s collection, for £57,000.

===Foundation and early history===
The National Gallery opened in 1824 in Angerstein&#x27;s former townhouse at No. 100 Pall Mall. Angerstein&#x27;s paintings were joined in 1826 by those from Beaumont&#x27;s collection, and in 1831 by the Reverend William Holwell Carr&#x27;s bequest of 35 paintings. Initially the Keeper of Paintings, William Seguier, bore the burden of managing the gallery, but in July 1824 some of this responsibility fell to the newly formed board of trustees.

The National Gallery at Pall Mall was frequently overcrowded and hot, and its diminutive size in comparison with the Louvre in Paris was a cause of national embarrassment. But Agar-Ellis, by then a trustee of the gallery, appraised the site for being &quot;in the very gangway of London&quot;; this was seen as necessary for the gallery to fulfil its social purpose. Subsidence in No. 100 caused the gallery to move briefly to No. 105 Pall Mall, which the novelist Anthony Trollope described as a &quot;dingy, dull, narrow house, ill-adapted for the exhibition of the treasures it held&quot;. This in turn had to be demolished for the opening of a road to Carlton House Terrace.

In 1832, construction began on a new building by William Wilkins on the northern half of the site of the old Royal Mews in Charing Cross, after the transformation of its southern half into Trafalgar Square in the late 1820s. The location was a significant one, between the wealthy West End and poorer areas to the east. The argument that the collection could be accessed by people of all social classes outstripped other concerns, such as the pollution of central London or the failings of Wilkins&#x27;s building, when the prospect of a move to South Kensington was mooted in the 1850s. According to the Parliamentary Commission of 1857, &quot;The &quot;existence&quot; of the pictures is not the end purpose of the collection, but the means only to give the people an ennobling enjoyment&quot;.

=== Growth under Eastlake and his successors ===
15th- and 16th-century Italian paintings were at the core of the National Gallery and for the first 30 years of its existence the trustees&#x27; independent acquisitions were mainly limited to works by High Renaissance masters. Their conservative tastes resulted in several missed opportunities and the management of the gallery later fell into complete disarray, with no acquisitions being made between 1847 and 1850. A critical House of Commons report in 1851 called for the appointment of a director, whose authority would surpass that of the trustees. Many thought the position would go to the German art historian Gustav Friedrich Waagen, whom the gallery had consulted on previous occasions about the lighting and display of the collections. However, the man preferred for the job by Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and the Prime Minister, Lord John Russell, was the Keeper of Paintings at the gallery, Sir Charles Lock Eastlake. Eastlake, who was President of the Royal Academy, played an essential role in the foundation of the Arundel Society and knew most of London&#x27;s leading art experts.

The new director&#x27;s taste was for the Northern and Early Italian Renaissance masters or &quot;primitives&quot;, who had been neglected by the gallery&#x27;s acquisitions policy but were slowly gaining recognition from connoisseurs. He made annual tours to the continent and to Italy in particular, seeking out appropriate paintings to buy for the gallery. In all, he bought 148 pictures abroad and 46 in Britain, among the former such seminal works as Paolo Uccello&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of San Romano&quot;. Eastlake also amassed a private art collection during this period, consisting of paintings that he knew did not interest the trustees. His ultimate aim, however, was for them to enter the National Gallery; this was duly arranged upon his death by his friend and successor as director, William Boxall, and his widow Lady Elizabeth Eastlake.

One of the most persistent criticisms of the National Gallery, other than of the perceived inadequacies of the building, has been of its conservation policy. The gallery&#x27;s detractors have accused it of having had an over-zealous approach to restoration. The first cleaning operation at the National Gallery began in 1844 after Eastlake&#x27;s appointment as Keeper, and was the subject of attacks in the press after the first three paintings to receive the treatment – a Rubens, a Cuyp and a Velázquez – were unveiled to the public in 1846. The gallery&#x27;s most virulent critic was J. Morris Moore, who wrote a series of letters to &quot;The Times&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Verax&quot; savaging the institution&#x27;s cleanings. While an 1853 Parliamentary select committee set up to investigate the matter cleared the gallery of any wrongdoing, criticism of its methods has been erupting sporadically ever since from some in the art establishment.

The gallery&#x27;s lack of space remained acute in this period. In 1845, a large bequest of British paintings was made by Robert Vernon; there was insufficient room in the Wilkins building so they were displayed first in Vernon&#x27;s town house at No. 50 Pall Mall and then at Marlborough House. The gallery was even less well equipped for its next major bequest, as J. M. W. Turner was to bequeath the entire contents of his studio, excepting unfinished works, to the nation upon his death in 1851. The first 20 of these were displayed off-site in Marlborough House in 1856. Ralph Nicholson Wornum, the gallery&#x27;s Keeper and Secretary, worked with John Ruskin to bring the bequest together. The stipulation in Turner&#x27;s will that two of his paintings be displayed alongside works by Claude is still honoured as of 2024, but his bequest has never been adequately displayed in its entirety; today the works are divided between Trafalgar Square and the Clore Gallery, a small purpose-built extension to Tate Britain completed in 1985.

The third director, Sir Frederic William Burton, laid the foundations of the collection of 18th-century art and made several outstanding purchases from English private collections. The acquisition in 1885 of two paintings from Blenheim Palace, Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Ansidei Madonna&quot; and van Dyck&#x27;s &quot;Equestrian Portrait of Charles I&quot;, with a record-setting grant of £87,500 from the Treasury, brought the gallery&#x27;s &quot;golden age of collecting&quot; to an end, as its annual purchase grant was suspended for several years thereafter. When the gallery purchased Holbein&#x27;s &quot;Ambassadors&quot; from the Earl of Radnor in 1890, it did so with the aid of private individuals for the first time in its history. In 1897, the formation of the National Gallery of British Art, known unofficially from early in its history as the Tate Gallery, allowed some British works to be moved off-site, following the precedent set by the Vernon collection and the Turner Bequest. Works by artists born after 1790 were moved to the new gallery on Millbank, which allowed Hogarth, Turner and Constable to remain in Trafalgar Square.

===Early 20th century===
The agricultural crisis at the turn of the 20th century caused many aristocratic families to sell their paintings, but the British national collections were priced out of the market by American plutocrats. This prompted the foundation of the National Art-Collections Fund, a society of subscribers dedicated to stemming the flow of artworks to the United States. Their first acquisition for the National Gallery was Velázquez&#x27;s &quot;Rokeby Venus&quot; in 1906, followed by Holbein&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Christina of Denmark&quot; in 1909. However, despite the crisis in aristocratic fortunes, the following decade was one of several great bequests from private collectors. In 1909, the industrialist Ludwig Mond gave 42 Italian Renaissance paintings, including the &quot;Mond Crucifixion&quot; by Raphael, to the gallery. Other bequests of note were those of George Salting in 1910, Austen Henry Layard in 1916 and Sir Hugh Lane in 1917.

The initial reception of Impressionist art at the gallery was exceptionally controversial. In 1906, Sir Hugh Lane promised 39 paintings, including Renoir&#x27;s &quot;Umbrellas&quot;, to the National Gallery on his death, unless a suitable building could be built in Dublin. Although eagerly accepted by the director Charles Holroyd, they were received with extreme hostility by the trustees; Lord Redesdale wrote that &quot;I would as soon expect to hear of a Mormon service being conducted in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral as to see the exhibition of the works of the modern French Art-rebels in the sacred precincts of Trafalgar Square&quot;. Perhaps as a result of such attitudes, Lane amended his will with a codicil that the works should only go to Ireland, but crucially this was never witnessed. Lane died on board the in 1915, and a dispute began which was not resolved until 1959. Part of the collection is now on permanent loan to the Hugh Lane Gallery and other works rotate between London and Dublin every few years.

A fund for the purchase of modern paintings established by Samuel Courtauld in 1923 bought Seurat&#x27;s &quot;Bathers at Asnières&quot; and other modern works for the nation; in 1934, many of these were transferred to the National Gallery from the Tate.

The director Kenneth Clark&#x27;s decision in 1939 to label a group of Venetian paintings, &quot;Scenes from Tebaldeo&#x27;s Eclogues&quot;, as works by Giorgione was controversial at the time, and the panels were soon identified as works by Andrea Previtali by a junior curator Clark had appointed.

===Second World War===

Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War the paintings were evacuated to locations in Wales, including Penrhyn Castle and the university colleges of Bangor and Aberystwyth. In 1940, during the Battle of France, a more secure home was sought, and there were discussions about moving the paintings to Canada. This idea was firmly rejected by Winston Churchill, who wrote in a telegram to Kenneth Clark, &quot;bury them in caves or in cellars, but not a picture shall leave these islands&quot;. Instead a slate quarry at Manod, near Blaenau Ffestiniog in North Wales, was requisitioned for the gallery&#x27;s use. In the seclusion afforded by the paintings&#x27; new location, the Keeper (and future director) Martin Davies began to compile scholarly catalogues on the collection, with assistance of the gallery&#x27;s library which was also stored in the quarry. The move to Manod confirmed the importance of storing paintings at a constant temperature and humidity, something the gallery&#x27;s conservators had long suspected but had hitherto been unable to prove. This eventually resulted in the first air-conditioned gallery opening in 1949.

For the course of the war Myra Hess and other musicians, such as Moura Lympany, gave daily lunch-time recitals in the empty building in Trafalgar Square, to raise public morale as every concert hall in London was closed. Art exhibitions were held at the gallery as a complement to the recitals. The first of these was &quot;British Painting since Whistler&quot; in 1940, organised by Lillian Browse, who also mounted the major joint retrospective &quot;Exhibition of Paintings by Sir William Nicholson and Jack B. Yeats&quot; held from 1 January to 15 March 1942, which was seen by 10,518 visitors. Exhibitions of work by war artists, including Paul Nash, Henry Moore and Stanley Spencer, were also held; the War Artists&#x27; Advisory Committee had been set up by Clark in order &quot;to keep artists at work on any pretext&quot;. In 1941, a request from an artist to see Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Margaretha de Geer&quot; (a new acquisition) resulted in the &quot;Picture of the Month&quot; scheme, in which a single painting was removed from Manod and exhibited to the general public in the National Gallery each month. The art critic Herbert Read, writing that year, called the National Gallery &quot;a defiant outpost of culture right in the middle of a bombed and shattered metropolis&quot;. The paintings returned to Trafalgar Square in 1945.

===Post-war developments===
The last major outcry against the use of radical conservation techniques at the National Gallery was in the immediate post-war years, following a restoration campaign by the gallery&#x27;s chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann while the paintings were in Manod Quarry. When the cleaned pictures were exhibited to the public in 1946 there followed a furore with parallels to that of a century earlier. The principal criticism was that the extensive removal of varnish, which was used in the 19th century to protect the surface of paintings but which darkened and discoloured over time, may have resulted in the loss of &quot;harmonising&quot; glazes added to the paintings by the artists themselves. The opposition to Ruhemann&#x27;s techniques was led by Ernst Gombrich, a professor at the Warburg Institute who in later correspondence with a restorer described being treated with &quot;offensive superciliousness&quot; by the National Gallery. A 1947 commission concluded that no damage had been done in the recent cleanings.

In the post-war years, acquisitions have become increasingly difficult for the National Gallery as the prices for Old Masters – and even more so for the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists – have risen beyond its means. Some of the gallery&#x27;s most significant purchases in this period would have been impossible without the major public appeals backing them, including Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s cartoon of &quot;The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist&quot; (bought in 1962) and Titian&#x27;s &quot;Death of Actaeon&quot; (bought in 1972). The gallery&#x27;s purchase grant from the government was frozen in 1985, but later that year it received an endowment of £50 million from Sir Paul Getty, enabling many major purchases to be made. In April 1985 Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover and his brothers, the Hon. Simon Sainsbury and Sir Timothy Sainsbury, had made a donation that would enable the construction of the Sainsbury Wing.

The directorship of Neil MacGregor saw a major rehang at the gallery, dispensing with the classification of paintings by national school that had been introduced by Eastlake. The new chronological hang sought to emphasise the interaction between cultures rather than fixed national characteristics, reflecting the change in art-historical values since the 19th century. In other respects, however, Victorian tastes were rehabilitated: the building&#x27;s interiors were no longer considered an embarrassment and were restored, and in 1999 the gallery accepted a bequest of 26 Italian Baroque paintings from Sir Denis Mahon. Earlier in the 20th century many considered the Baroque to be beyond the pale: in 1945 the gallery&#x27;s trustees declined to buy a Guercino from Mahon&#x27;s collection for £200. The same painting was valued at £4 million in 2003. Mahon&#x27;s bequest was made on the condition that the gallery would never deaccession any of its paintings or charge for admission.

Jock McFadyen was the first Artist in Residence in 1981. Since 1989, the gallery has run an Associate Artist scheme that gives a studio to contemporary artists to create work based on the permanent collection. They usually hold the position of associate artist for two years and are given an exhibition in the National Gallery at the end of their tenure.

The respective remits of the National and Tate Galleries, which had long been contested by the two institutions, were more clearly defined in 1996. 1900 was established as the cut-off point for paintings in the National Gallery, and in 1997 more than 60 post-1900 paintings from the collection were given to the Tate on a long-term loan, in return for works by Gauguin and others. However, future expansion of the National Gallery may yet see the return of 20th-century paintings to its walls.

===21st century===

In the 21st century there have been three large fundraising campaigns at the gallery: in 2004, to buy Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Madonna of the Pinks&quot;; in 2008, for Titian&#x27;s &quot;Diana and Actaeon&quot;; and in 2012, Titian&#x27;s &quot;Diana and Callisto&quot;. Both Titians were bought in tandem with the National Gallery of Scotland for £95 m. Both of these major works were sold from the collection of the Duke of Sutherland. The National Gallery is now largely priced out of the market for Old Master paintings and can only make such acquisitions with the backing of major public appeals; the departing director Charles Saumarez Smith expressed his frustration at this situation in 2007.

The National Gallery was sponsored by the Italian arms manufacturer Finmeccanica between October 2011 and October 2012. The sponsorship deal allowed the company to use gallery spaces for gatherings, and the gallery was used to host delegates during the DSEI arms fair and the Farnborough Airshow. The sponsorship deal was ended a year early after protests.

In February 2014, the gallery purchased &quot;Men of the Docks&quot; by the American artist George Bellows for $25.5 million (£15.6 million). It was the first major American painting to be purchased by the gallery. The director, Nicholas Penny, termed the painting a new direction for the gallery, a non-European painting in a European style. Its sale was controversial in the United States.

In 2018, the National Gallery was one of the first public galleries in London to charge more than £20 for admission to a special exhibition, the exhibition in question being of works by Claude Monet.

In February 2019, an employment tribunal ruled that the gallery had incorrectly classed its team of educators as self-employed contractors. The educators were awarded the status of &quot;workers&quot; following legal action brought by 27 claimants. The case received considerable press and media coverage.

In 2024, the National Gallery celebrated its 200th anniversary with a range of programmes, events, and collaborations.

==Architecture==
===William Wilkins&#x27;s building===
The first suggestion for a National Gallery on Trafalgar Square came from John Nash, who envisaged it on the site of the King&#x27;s Mews, while a Parthenon-like building for the Royal Academy would occupy the centre of the square. Economic recession prevented this scheme from being built, but a competition for the Mews site was eventually held in 1831, for which Nash submitted a design with Charles Robert Cockerell as his co-architect. Nash&#x27;s popularity was waning by this time, however, and the commission was awarded to William Wilkins, who was involved in the selection of the site and submitted some drawings at the last moment. Wilkins had hoped to build a &quot;Temple of the Arts, nurturing contemporary art through historical example&quot;, but the commission was blighted by parsimony and compromise, and the resulting building, which opened to the public on 9 April 1838, was deemed a failure on almost all counts.

The site only allowed for the building to be one room deep, as a workhouse and a barracks lay immediately behind. To exacerbate matters, there was a public right of way through the site to these buildings, which accounts for the access porticoes on the eastern and western sides of the façade. These had to incorporate columns from the demolished Carlton House, and their relative shortness resulted in an elevation that was deemed excessively low, thus failing to provide Trafalgar Square with its desired commanding focal point to the north. Also recycled are the sculptures on the façade, originally intended for Nash&#x27;s Marble Arch but abandoned due to his financial problems. The eastern half of the building housed the Royal Academy until 1868, which further diminished the space afforded to the National Gallery.

The building was the object of public ridicule before it had even been completed, as a version of the design had been leaked to &quot;The Literary Gazette&quot; in 1833. Two years before completion, its infamous &quot;pepperpot&quot; elevation appeared on the frontispiece of &quot;Contrasts&quot; (1836), an influential tract by the Gothicist Augustus Pugin, as an example of the degeneracy of the classical style. Even William IV (in his last recorded utterance) thought the building a &quot;nasty little pokey hole&quot;, while William Makepeace Thackeray called it &quot;a little gin shop of a building&quot;. The twentieth-century architectural historian Sir John Summerson echoed these early criticisms when he compared the arrangement of a dome and two diminutive turrets on the roofline to &quot;the clock and vases on a mantelpiece, only less useful&quot;. Sir Charles Barry&#x27;s landscaping of Trafalgar Square, from 1840, included a north terrace so that the building would appear to be raised, thus addressing one of the points of complaint. Opinion on the building had mellowed considerably by 1984, when Prince Charles called the Wilkins façade a &quot;much-loved and elegant friend&quot;, in contrast to a proposed extension. (&quot;See below&quot;)

===Alteration and expansion (Pennethorne, Barry and Taylor)===
The first significant alteration made to the building was the single, long gallery added by Sir James Pennethorne in 1860–1861. Ornately decorated in comparison with the rooms by Wilkins, it nonetheless worsened the cramped conditions inside the building as it was built over the original entrance hall. Unsurprisingly, several attempts were made either to completely remodel the National Gallery (as suggested by Sir Charles Barry in 1853), or to move it to more capacious premises in Kensington, where the air was also cleaner. In 1867 Barry&#x27;s son Edward Middleton Barry proposed to replace the Wilkins building with a massive classical building with four domes. The scheme was a failure and contemporary critics denounced the exterior as &quot;a strong plagiarism upon St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral&quot;.

With the demolition of the workhouse, however, Barry was able to build the gallery&#x27;s first sequence of grand architectural spaces, from 1872 to 1876. Built to a polychrome Neo-Renaissance design, the Barry Rooms were arranged on a Greek cross plan around a huge central octagon. Though it compensated for the underwhelming architecture of the Wilkins building, Barry&#x27;s new wing was disliked by Gallery staff, who considered its monumental aspect to be in conflict with its function as exhibition space. Also, the decorative programme of the rooms did not take their intended contents into account; the ceiling of the 15th- and 16th-century Italian gallery, for instance, was inscribed with the names of British artists of the 19th century. However, despite these failures, the Barry Rooms provided the gallery with a strong axial groundplan; this was to be followed by all subsequent additions to the gallery for a century, resulting in a building of clear symmetry.

Pennethorne&#x27;s gallery was demolished for the next phase of building, a scheme by Sir John Taylor extending northwards of the main entrance. Its glass-domed entrance vestibule had painted ceiling decorations by the Crace family firm, who had also worked on the Barry Rooms. A fresco intended for the south wall was never realised.

===20th century: modernisation versus restoration===
Later additions to the west came more steadily but maintained the coherence of the building by mirroring Barry&#x27;s cross-axis plan to the east. The use of dark marble for doorcases was also continued, giving the extensions a degree of internal consistency with the older rooms. The classical style was still in use at the National Gallery in 1929, when a Beaux-Arts–style gallery was built, funded by the art dealer and trustee Lord Duveen. However, it was not long before the 20th-century reaction against Victorian attitudes became manifest at the gallery. From 1928 to 1952, the landing floors of Taylor&#x27;s entrance hall were relaid with a new series of mosaics by Boris Anrep, who was friendly with the Bloomsbury Group. These mosaics can be read as a satire on 19th-century conventions for the decoration of public buildings, as typified by the Albert Memorial&#x27;s &quot;Frieze of Parnassus&quot;. The central mosaic depicting &quot;The Awakening of the Muses&quot; includes portraits of Virginia Woolf and Greta Garbo, subverting the high moral tone of its Victorian forebears. In place of Christianity&#x27;s seven virtues, Anrep offered his own set of &quot;Modern Virtues&quot;, including &quot;Humour&quot; and &quot;Open Mind&quot;; the allegorical figures are again portraits of his contemporaries, including Winston Churchill, Bertrand Russell and T. S. Eliot.

In the 20th century, the gallery&#x27;s late Victorian interiors fell out of fashion. The Crace ceiling decorations in the entrance hall were not to the taste of the director Charles Holmes, and were obliterated by white paint.
The North Galleries, which opened to the public in 1975, marked the arrival of modernist architecture at the National Gallery. In the older rooms, the original classical details were effaced by partitions, daises and suspended ceilings, the aim being to create neutral settings which did not distract from contemplation of the paintings. But the gallery&#x27;s commitment to modernism was short-lived: by the 1980s Victorian style was no longer considered anathema, and a restoration programme began to restore the 19th- and early 20th-century interiors to their purported original appearance. This began with the refurbishment of the Barry Rooms in 1985–1986. From 1996 to 1999 even the North Galleries, by then considered to &quot;lack a positive architectural character&quot;, were remodelled in a classical style, albeit a simplified one.

===Sainsbury Wing and later additions===
The most important addition to the building in the late 20th century was the Sainsbury Wing, designed by the postmodernist architects Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown to house the collection of Renaissance paintings and built in 1991. The building occupies the &quot;Hampton&#x27;s site&quot; to the west of the main building, where a department store of the same name had stood until its destruction in the Blitz. The gallery had long sought expansion into this space and in 1982 a competition was held to find a suitable architect; the shortlist included a radical high-tech proposal by Richard Rogers, among others. The design that won the most votes was by the firm Ahrends, Burton and Koralek, who then modified their proposal to include a tower, similar to that of the Rogers scheme. The proposal was dropped after the Prince of Wales compared the design to a &quot;monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend&quot;. The term &quot;monstrous carbuncle&quot;, for a modern building that clashes with its surroundings, has since become commonplace.

One of the conditions of the 1982 competition was that the new wing had to include commercial offices as well as public gallery space. However, in 1985 it became possible to devote the extension entirely to the gallery&#x27;s uses, due to a donation of almost £50 million from Lord Sainsbury and his brothers Simon and Sir Tim Sainsbury. A closed competition was held, and the schemes produced were noticeably more restrained than in the earlier competition.

In contrast with the rich ornamentation of the main building, the galleries in the Sainsbury Wing are pared down and intimate, to suit the smaller scale of many of the paintings. The main inspirations for these rooms are Sir John Soane&#x27;s toplit galleries for the Dulwich Picture Gallery and the church interiors of Filippo Brunelleschi. (The stone dressing is in pietra serena, the grey stone local to Florence.) The northernmost galleries align with Barry&#x27;s central axis, so that there is a single vista down the whole length of the gallery. This axis is exaggerated by the use of false perspective, as the columns flanking each opening gradually diminish in size until the visitor reaches the focal point (as of 2009), an altarpiece by Cima of &quot;The Incredulity of Saint Thomas&quot;. Venturi&#x27;s postmodernist approach to architecture is in full evidence at the Sainsbury Wing, with its stylistic quotations from buildings as disparate as the clubhouses on Pall Mall, the Scala Regia in the Vatican, Victorian warehouses and Ancient Egyptian temples.

Following the pedestrianisation of Trafalgar Square, the gallery is currently engaged in a masterplan to convert the vacated office space on the ground floor into public space. The plan will also fill in disused courtyards and make use of land acquired from the adjoining National Portrait Gallery in St Martin&#x27;s Place, which it gave to the National Gallery in exchange for land for its 2000 extension. The first phase, the East Wing Project designed by Jeremy Dixon and Edward Jones, opened to the public in 2004. This provided a new ground level entrance from Trafalgar Square, named in honour of Sir Paul Getty. The main entrance was also refurbished, and reopened in September 2005. Possible future projects include a &quot;West Wing Project&quot; roughly symmetrical with the East Wing Project, which would provide a future ground level entrance, and the public opening of some small rooms at the far eastern end of the building acquired as part of the swap with the National Portrait Gallery. This might include a new public staircase in the bow on the eastern façade. No timetable has been announced for these additional projects.

====Renovation of the Sainsbury Wing====
In April 2021, a jury short-listed six firms of architects – Caruso St John, David Chipperfield Architects, Asif Kahn, David Kohn Architects, Selldorf Architects, and Witherford Watson Mann Architects – in a competition for design proposals to upgrade the Sainsbury Wing.

A letter written in 1990 by one of the donors, John Sainsbury, was discovered in 2023 during the demolition of two false columns in which he argued that &quot;the false columns are a mistake of the architect and that we would live to regret our accepting this detail of his design.&quot;

In 2024, excavations for the Sainsbury Wing extension at Jubilee Walk uncovered evidence that the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Lundenwic extended further to the west than had previously been supposed.
==Incidents==
In the National Gallery on 10 March 1914, Velázquez&#x27;s &quot;Rokeby Venus&quot; was damaged by Mary Richardson, a campaigner for women&#x27;s suffrage, in protest against the arrest of Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day. Later that month another suffragette attacked five Bellinis, causing the gallery to close until the start of the First World War, when the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union called for an end to violent acts drawing attention to their plight.

In August 1961 an unemployed bus driver, Kempton Bunton, stole Goya&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of the Duke of Wellington&quot;, in what remains the only successful theft from the gallery. Four years later, Bunton returned the painting voluntarily. Following a high-profile trial, he was found not guilty of stealing the painting, but guilty of stealing the frame.

In July 1987, a man entered the gallery armed with a shotgun concealed under his coat and shot Leonardo&#x27;s cartoon of &quot;The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist&quot;. The man, Robert Cambridge, told police that his intent had been to express his disgust with &quot;political, social and economic conditions in Britain&quot;. Though the pellets did not penetrate the cartoon, it had to undergo extensive restoration. It was placed back on display the following year.

Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;Sunflowers&quot; was attacked at the gallery on 14 October 2022 by environmental activists from the Just Stop Oil campaign, who threw tomato soup at it. Due to the protection of the plexiglass, the painting was not harmed, but there was some minor damage to the frame, according to a spokesperson for the gallery. 

On 6 November 2023, the &quot;Rokeby Venus&quot; was again attacked, by two Just Stop Oil activists who smashed its protective glass with hammers.

<text>The Horezu Monastery or Hurezi Monastery was founded in 1690 by Prince Constantin Brâncoveanu in the town of Horezu, Wallachia, Romania. It is considered to be a masterpiece of &quot;Brâncovenesc style&quot;, known for its architectural purity and balance, the richness of its sculpted detail, its treatment of religious compositions, its votive portraits, and its painted decorative works.

The monastery has been inscribed by UNESCO on its list of World Heritage Sites.

<doc id="98620" wikidata="Q729327" url="?curid=98620" title="Dacian Fortresses of the Orăștie Mountains">
<text>Built in murus dacicus style, the six Dacian Fortresses of the Orăștie Mountains (), in Romania, were created in the 1st centuries BC and AD as protection against Roman conquest, and played an important role during the Roman–Dacian wars.

Their extensive and well-preserved remains present a picture of a vigorous and innovative ancient civilization. Today, treasure-hunters sometimes search the area, as Romania lacks legislation in this domain (see Archaeological looting in Romania).

The six fortresses — Sarmizegetusa Regia, Costești-Cetățuie, Costești-Blidaru, Piatra Roșie, Bănița, and Căpâlna — that formed the defensive system of Decebalus were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999. All the sites are in Hunedoara County, except for Căpâlna, which is in Alba County.

==Sarmizegetusa Regia==
The town of Sarmizegetusa Regia was the capital and major fortress of the Dacian kingdom, probably built in the mid first century BCE. It consisted of perimeter walls and fortifications, a sacred precinct, and a settlement area primarily for nobles and supporting servants. It was located at the top of a hill with excellent visibility of the surrounding lands. The sacred precinct was on the east side of the town, with a prominent plaza and circular shrines. There were two settlement areas one on the east side and a larger one on the west. In addition to dwellings they included workshops, storage buildings, and agricultural processing areas. Notable for the time is a distribution system for drinking water that used ceramic pipes.

==Costești-Cetățuie==
==Costești-Blidaru==
==Piatra Roșie==
Piatra Roșie, which means &quot;Red Rock&quot;, was a Dacian hill fort two days march to the west from Costești-Cetățuie, at Luncani in Boșorod commune. It was built in two phases. In the first phase a long (102 m) rectangular main citadel was built at the height of land with watch towers on each end and two outlying watch towers. Later the larger area inside the watch towers was enclosed with walls. It appears that the hilltop was flattened in the process in order to produce a usable space.

<text>The wooden churches of Maramureș in the Maramureș region of northern Transylvania are a group of almost one hundred Orthodox churches, and occasionally Greek-Catholic ones, of different architectural solutions from different periods and areas. The Maramureș churches are high timber constructions with characteristic tall, slim bell towers at the western end of the building. They are a particular vernacular expression of the cultural landscape of this mountainous area of northern Romania.

Maramureș is one of the better-known regions of Romania, with autonomous traditions since the Middle Ages. Its well-preserved wooden villages and churches, its traditional lifestyle, and the local colourful dresses still in use make Maramureș as near to a living museum as can be found in Europe.

The wooden churches of the region that still stand were built starting from the 17th century all the way to 19th century. Some were erected on the place of older churches. They were a response to the prohibition against the erection of stone Orthodox churches by the Catholic Austro-Hungarian authorities. The churches are made of thick logs, some are quite small and dark inside but several of them have impressive measures. They are painted with rather &quot;naïve&quot; Biblical scenes, mostly by local painters. The most characteristic features are the tall tower above the entrance and the massive roof that seems to dwarf the main body of the church.

Eight were listed by the UNESCO as World Heritage Sites in 1999, for their religious architecture and timber construction traditions. These are: Bârsana, Budești, Desești, Ieud, Plopiș, Poienile Izei, Rogoz, Șurdești.

==Description==

The historical Romanian region of Maramureș, partitioned between Romania and Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia after World War I, is one of the places where traditional log building was not interrupted and where a rich heritage in wood survives. The tradition of building wooden churches in central and southern Maramureș can be traced from the beginning of the 16th century to the turn of the 18th century. Since the knowledge used to build the local wooden churches circulated throughout Europe, their understanding is of high interest far outside the region.

In Maramureș today almost 100 wooden churches still stand, about one third of their total two centuries ago. Besides the extant wooden churches, a major source of knowledge is still saved by a number of practicing senior carpenters with relevant knowledge and skills in traditional carpentry.

From the Middle Ages until the turn of the 18th century the skills, knowledge and experience to build ample log structures with plane and well sealed walls, as well as with flush joints, were performances out of the ordinary. The craftsmen from Maramureș who were able to reach such levels were not simple peasants but well specialised church carpenters who inherited and maintained this advanced knowledge to exclusively build houses of worship.

Since the local tradition to erect wooden churches depended on those who built and used them, it is fundamental to identify the local builders and founders. The earlier blurred distinction between them veiled their separate roles in shaping the wooden churches and hindered us from a clear understanding of the results.

The extant wooden churches from Maramureș reveal the existence during the 17th and 18th centuries of at least two main family schools of church carpenters. There are further distinguishable three main itineraries and numerous smaller ones, indicating the work of some of the most important church carpenters ever active in the region and in some cases even shifts among generations. In general, the church carpenters stood for the technical performances, the high quality of the wood work and the artistic refinement.

In a long perspective, the true creators of the local wooden churches were actually the commissioning founders. Especially the role of the noble founders of Eastern Christian rite was decisive in the formation of a regional character among the local wooden churches. The wooden churches from Maramureș closely mirror the local society of modest country landlords, manifesting themselves along several centuries in their double condition of Eastern Christians and Western nobles.

The wooden churches from Maramureș open necessary connections with similar performances throughout Europe. Seemingly the local distinction made between sacred and profane rooms was characteristic for many other rural regions on the continent. The highest knowledge in log building seems to have had a sacred purpose with wide continental circulation and therefore in many places requires distinction from the more regionally rooted vernacular one.

The publication in a journal from 1866 of several drawings representing a wooden church from Seini, situated in the neighbouring Szatmár County, produced echoes in Europe, being compared with the already famous Norwegian stave churches.

With the resurgence of church construction after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, there are new churches built in the traditional style.

==Wooden churches==
The list shows extant wooden churches in bold and also includes some known vanished ones. For those now in Ukraine, Romanian and Hungarian names of Ukrainian villages are given in (parentheses). In Romanian, &quot;Susani&quot; denotes &quot;high-dwellers&quot; and &quot;Josani&quot; &quot;lower-dwellers&quot;. Thus the names distinguish the churches of those large villages which had more than one.

<text>Sighișoara (; ; ; Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Schäsbrich&quot;, &quot;Šesburχ&quot;, or &quot;Scheeßprich&quot;; ; or ) is a city on the Târnava Mare River in Mureș County, central Romania. Located in the historic region of Transylvania, Sighișoara had a population of 23,927 according to the 2021 census. It is a popular tourist destination for its well-preserved old town, which is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site since 1999. The town administers seven villages: Angofa, Aurel Vlaicu, Hetiur, Rora, Șoromiclea, Venchi, and Viilor.

== History ==



Starting with the mid 12th century, German craftsmen and merchants known as the Transylvanian Saxons () were invited to Transylvania by the then King of Hungary, Géza II, to settle and defend the frontier of his realm and improve the region&#x27;s economy. The chronicler Krauss lists a Saxon settlement in present-day Sighișoara by 1191. A document of 1280 records a town built on the site of a Roman fort as &quot;Castrum Sex&quot; or &quot;six-sided camp&quot;, referring to the fort&#x27;s shape of an irregular hexagon. Other names recorded include &quot;Schaäsburg&quot; (1282), &quot;Schespurg&quot; (1298) and &quot;Segusvar&quot; (1300). By 1337 Sighișoara had become a royal center for the kings, who awarded the settlement urban status in 1367 as the &quot;Civitas de Segusvar&quot;.

The town played an important strategic and commercial role at the edges of Central Europe for several centuries. Sighișoara became one of the most important urban centres of Transylvania, with artisans from throughout the Holy Roman Empire visiting the settlement. The German artisans and craftsmen dominated the urban economy, as well as building the fortifications protecting it. It is estimated that during the 16th and 17th centuries Sighișoara had as many as 15 guilds and 20 handicraft branches. The Baroque sculptor Elias Nicolai lived in the town. The Wallachian &quot;voivode&quot; Vlad Dracul (father of Vlad the Impaler), who lived in exile in the town, had coins minted in the town (otherwise coinage was the monopoly of the Hungarian kings in the Kingdom of Hungary) and issued the first document listing the city&#x27;s Romanian name, &quot;Sighișoara&quot;. The Romanian name is first attested in 1435, and derives from the Hungarian &quot;Segesvár&quot;, where &quot;vár&quot; is &quot;fort&quot;.

The town was the setting for George I Rákóczi&#x27;s election as Prince of Transylvania and King of Hungary in 1631. Sighișoara suffered military occupation, fires, and plagues during the 17th and 18th centuries. An important source for the history of 17th-century Transylvania, for the period of 1606–1666, are the records of Georg Kraus, the town&#x27;s notary.

The nearby plain of Albești was the site of the Battle of Segesvár, where the revolutionary Hungarian army led by Józef Bem was defeated by the Russian army led by Lüders on 31 July 1849. A monument was constructed in 1852 to the Russian general Skariatin, who died in the battle. The Hungarian poet Sándor Petőfi is generally believed to have been killed in the battle, and a monument was constructed in his honor at Albești in 1897. After World War I Sighișoara passed with Transylvania from Austria-Hungary to the Kingdom of Romania.

Central Sighișoara has preserved in an exemplary way the features of a small medieval fortified town. It has been listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Each year, a medieval Festival takes place in the old citadel in July.

In Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe, Sighișoara is one of the few fortified towns that are still inhabited. The town is made up of two parts. The medieval stronghold was built on top of a hill and is known as the Citadel (). The lower town lies in the valley of Târnava Mare river.

The houses inside Sighișoara Citadel show the main features of a craftsmen&#x27;s town. However, there are some houses that belonged to the former patriciate, like the Venetian House and the House with Antlers.

Between 2001 and 2003, the construction of a Dracula theme park in the &quot;Braite&quot; nature preserve near Sighișoara was considered but ultimately rejected, owing to the strong opposition of local civil society groups and national and international media as well as politically influential persons, as the theme park would have detracted from the medieval style of the city and would have destroyed the nature preserve.

== Demographics and name ==

Ethnic groups in 2011:
* Romanians (75%)
* Hungarians (17.6%)
* Roma (5.3%)
* Germans (more specifically Transylvanian Saxons) (1.5%)

== Sights ==


Sighișoara is a popular tourist destination for its well-preserved walled old town, which is also listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The main Citadel&#x27;s attractions are certainly the towers. The city is also an attraction on the Via Transilvanica long-distance trail.

=== Towers ===

According to ancient military architectures writings, the defence towers had to be a fortification system for the mutual defense, and, at the same time, each tower was supposed to be an independent fortress: a break at the base of a tower did not mean entering into the city, capturing a tower did not have to lead to the conquest of the city. Most of these towers were hollow and equipped with elevators and underground galleries.
* Sighișoara Clock Tower (&quot;Turnul cu Ceas&quot;) – the landmark of the city is a 64 m-high tower built in the 13th century. Today it is a museum of history.
* The Tinsmiths&#x27; Tower (&quot;Turnul Cositorarilor)&quot;
* The Butchers&#x27; Tower (&quot;Turnul Măcelarilor)&quot;
* The Bootmakers&#x27; Tower
* The Tailors&#x27; Tower (&quot;Turnul Croitorilor&quot;) 
* The Furriers&#x27; Tower (&quot;Turnul Cojocarilor&quot;)
* The Ironsmiths&#x27; Tower (&quot;Turnul Fierarilor&quot;) 
* The Ropemakers&#x27; Tower (&quot;Turnul Frânghierilor&quot;)
* The Tanners&#x27; Tower (&quot;Turnul Tăbăcarilor&quot;) 
* The Face Tower – tower on the route to Târgu Mureș, out of the citadel, but still worth visiting thanks to its story.

=== Churches ===

* The church on the hill (&quot;Biserica din Deal&quot;) – is undoubtedly one of the most valuable architectural monuments of the city and has been one of the most representative buildings of the gothic site of Romania. 
* The Monastery Church (&quot;Biserica Mânăstirii Dominicane&quot;) – is a gothic style architectural monument which is placed in the neighbourhood of the Clock tower and it was built at the beginning of the 13th century. It is the only church without a bell: the reason is basically that the Saxons weren&#x27;t great spenders and thought that one bell, the one of the Church on the hill, was enough for the whole city.
* The Saint Joseph Roman Catholic church
* Leprosy Church (&quot;Biserica Leproșilor&quot;)
* The Orthodox Cathedral of Sighișoara (Catedrala Ortodoxă)
* The old Orthodox church

=== Civil architecture ===

Most of the 164 houses in the town having at least 300 years are considered historical monuments, as follows: those in the Town Square (or Citadel Square), with its rectangular plan, was once inhabited by noble families of the town, though it has undergone too many transformations over time. The best houses are the ones that have kept their original shape.

* House on the Rock (Casa de pe stâncă) 
* House with shingles (Evert) – is dedicated to craftsmen for Educational Interethnic Centre for Youth.
* Venetian House or Green House (&quot;Casa Venețiană&quot;) 
* Vlad Dracul&#x27;s House 
* Sighișoara City Hall 
* Sighișoara hotel complex – built between 1886 and 1889 was the seat of city hall.
* Indoor wooden staircase or the Scholar&#x27;s Stairs
* School on the Hill 
* The Stag House (&quot;Casa cu Cerb&quot;)
* The Citadel Square (&quot;Piața Cetăți&quot;)
* Guilders&#x27; Association House (La Perla)
* Joseph B. Teusch Building (Hotel Central Park)

<doc id="98626" wikidata="Q4131" url="?curid=98626" title="Hamilton, South Lanarkshire">
<text>Hamilton (; ) is a large town in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. It serves as the main administrative centre of the South Lanarkshire council area. It sits south-east of Glasgow, south-west of Edinburgh and north of Carlisle. It is situated on the south bank of the River Clyde at its confluence with the Avon Water. Hamilton is the county town of the historic county of Lanarkshire and is the location of the headquarters of the modern local authority of South Lanarkshire.

The town itself has a population of around 55,000, which makes it the 9th largest locality in Scotland, and anchors a defined settlement of 84,000 (including neighbouring Blantyre, Bothwell and Uddingston) which is the country&#x27;s 8th largest.

==History==
The town of Hamilton was originally known as Cadzow or Cadyou (Middle Scots: ), the &quot;&quot; being the letter yogh), pronounced /kadju/. It is an ancient settlement, possibly dating back to the days of Strathclyde, or perhaps earlier. The Roman fort of Bothwellhaugh lies nearby. A lost medieval settlement was excavated in the 2010s near the Clyde, only around 1 mile from the current town. It is known that kings of Strathclyde did have a hunting lodge near Cadzow, and the area may have been a royal centre during the later stages of the kingdom, as a precursor to Cadzow Castle.

During the Wars of Scottish Independence the Hamilton family initially supported the English and Walter fitz Gilbert (the head of the Hamilton family) was governor of Bothwell Castle on behalf of the English. However, he later changed loyalty to Robert the Bruce, following the Battle of Bannockburn, and ceded Bothwell to him. For this act, he was rewarded with a portion of land which had been forfeited by the Comyns at Dalserf and later the Barony and lands of Cadzow, which in time would become the town of Hamilton.

Cadzow was renamed Hamilton in the time of James, Lord Hamilton, who was married to Princess Mary, the daughter of King James II. The Hamilton family themselves most likely took their name from the lands of Humbleton or Homildon in Northumberland, or perhaps from a place near Leicester.
The Hamiltons constructed many landmark buildings in the area including the Hamilton Mausoleum in Strathclyde Park, which has one of the longest reverb times of any manmade building at 15 seconds. The Hamilton family are major land-owners in the area to this day. Hamilton Palace was the seat of the Dukes of Hamilton until the early-twentieth century.

Other historic buildings in the area include Hamilton Old Parish Church, a Georgian era building completed in 1734 and the only church to have been built by William Adam. The graveyard of the old parish church contains some Covenanter remains. Hamilton Townhouse, which now houses a library and concert hall, underwent a sympathetic modernization in 2002 and opened to the public in summer 2004. The ruins of Cadzow Castle also lie in Chatelherault Country Park, from the town centre.

Hamilton Palace was the largest non-royal residence in the Western world, located in the north-east of the town. A former seat of the Dukes of Hamilton, it was built in 1695, subsequently much enlarged, and demolished in 1921 due to ground subsidence. It is widely acknowledged as having been one of the grandest houses in Scotland, was visited and admired by Queen Victoria, and was written about by Daniel Defoe.

Hamilton Barracks was formerly the Depot of the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) and the home of the 1st Battalion of the Regiment. The Regimental Museum is part of the Low Parks Museum.

The Low Parks Museum is housed in what was a 16th-century inn and a staging post for journeys between Glasgow and Edinburgh. Recently refurbished, it is the oldest building in Hamilton and is to the north of the Palace Grounds.

Renowned explorer and missionary David Livingstone&#x27;s house still stands at 17 Burnbank Road and has a plaque about him.

== Governance==
Hamilton is located within the Scottish council area of South Lanarkshire. Its local government services are provided by the unitary authority the South Lanarkshire Council, which is headquartered in Hamilton. Hamilton itself is divided between three wards, totalling 11 seats: Hamilton North and East, Hamilton West and Earnock and Hamilton South.

Hamilton is represented in the House of Commons by two Members of Parliament (MPs). The following MPs were elected from Hamilton in 2019:

* Imogen Walker (Labour) in Hamilton and Clyde Valley, first elected in 2024.
*Michael Shanks (Labour) in Rutherglen.

Hamilton is also represented in the Scottish Parliament by two constituency MSPs. The following MSPs were elected from Hamilton in 2021:

* Christina McKelvie (SNP) in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse, first elected in 2011.

Hamilton is twinned with Châtellerault in France. This connection dates from the 16th century when the title Duc de Châtellerault was conferred on James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran. The Duke&#x27;s Chatelherault Hunting Lodge (now in Chatelherault Country Park), a primary school and new railway station are named &#x27;Chatelherault&#x27; for this reason.

==Economy==
Service industries and local government are major employers in Hamilton. The town centre has been regenerated with new indoor shopping centres (the Regent Shopping Centre, New Cross Shopping Centre) Hamilton Retail Park and the Palace Grounds Retail Park.

Restaurants and national retail outlets are situated in a redeveloped part of the Palace Grounds that are visible upon entering the town from the M74 motorway. The creation of a circular town square has resulted in Hamilton receiving numerous town planning awards during the past decade. This development transformed the Hamilton side of Strathclyde Park, which was the original site of the Duke&#x27;s palace. 
Hamilton has been a Fairtrade Town since 2005.

==Transport==
Hamilton has three railway stations, Hamilton Central, Hamilton West and Chatelherault on the Argyle Line&#x27;s Hamilton Circle. Hamilton Central is approx 25 minutes from Glasgow on the Larkhall-Dalmuir service. It was once served by the North British Railway, which had three stations in the area - Hamilton (NBR), Peacock Cross railway station and Burnbank.

Beside Hamilton Central lies Hamilton Bus Station, providing links to surrounding towns and cities, also offering an express bus to Glasgow and also some parts of England. National Express services run to London and Birmingham from this station.

Major roads in the town include the A72 running south-east to Larkhall, the A723 south to Strathaven / north-east to Motherwell, and the A724 west towards Rutherglen, while to the west at Blantyre, the A725 dual carriageway connects the area to East Kilbride, Coatbridge and the M8. By road the town is to the west of the M74 motorway, the main southerly link to England, which joins the M6 just north of Carlisle. The main route from Edinburgh is the M8, leaving at junctions 6 or 7.

Cycling paths run from Strathclyde Park to Chatelherault Country Park following the banks of the Clyde and Avon. These are being expanded at part of the Sustrans Connect2 project and will make up part of the National Cycle Route 74 which will run from Uddingston to Carlisle, Cumbria

==Education==
There are currently three comprehensive high schools in the town – Hamilton Grammar, Holy Cross High School and St.John Ogilvie High School. The former Earnock High School merged with Blantyre High School in 2008 to create Calderside Academy. Hamilton also has one private school, Hamilton College, a Christian co-educational establishment comprising nursery, primary and high school.

There are 17 local authority primary schools in Hamilton; nine non-denominational and eight Roman Catholic schools. There are also provisions for children with Additional Support Needs, and the Hamilton School for the Deaf.

Hamilton is a university town with The University of the West of Scotland campus formerly sited on Almada Street, but now relocated to Hamilton International Technology Park in High Blantyre.

==Sports==
Hamilton Academical Football Club (the Accies) was formed in 1874 and is one of Scotland&#x27;s oldest senior clubs. It takes its name from Hamilton Academy, now called Hamilton Grammar School, the oldest school in the town (founded 1588). It is the only professional football team in the UK to originate from a school team and they currently play in the Scottish League One. Their stadium is New Douglas Park, built in 2001 near the site of the former ground Douglas Park (which was demolished in 1994 to make way for a retail park).

Hamilton Rugby Club is based at the Laigh Bent sports ground, Bent Road. They currently play in Tennent&#x27;s National League Division Three.

Hamilton Park Racecourse, a horseracing, wedding and event venue, is located in the town.

<text>Magma is a computer algebra system designed to solve problems in algebra, number theory, geometry and combinatorics. It is named after the algebraic structure magma. It runs on Unix-like operating systems, as well as Windows.

== Introduction ==
Magma is produced and distributed by the Computational Algebra Group within the Sydney School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Sydney.

In late 2006, the book Discovering Mathematics with Magma was published by Springer as volume 19 of the Algorithms and Computations in Mathematics series.

The Magma system is used extensively within pure mathematics. The Computational Algebra Group maintain a list of publications that cite Magma, and as of 2010 there are about 2600 citations, mostly in pure mathematics, but also including papers from areas as diverse as economics and geophysics.

==History==
The predecessor of the Magma system was named Cayley (1982–1993), after Arthur Cayley.

Magma was officially released in August 1993 (version 1.0). Version 2.0 of Magma was released in June 1996 and subsequent versions of 2.X have been released approximately once per year.

In 2013, the Computational Algebra Group finalized an agreement with the Simons Foundation, whereby the Simons Foundation will underwrite all costs of providing Magma to all U.S. nonprofit, non-governmental scientific research or educational institutions. All students, researchers and faculty associated with a participating institution will be able to access Magma for free, through that institution.

== Mathematical areas covered by the system ==
* Group theory
: Magma includes permutation, matrix, finitely presented, soluble, abelian (finite or infinite), polycyclic, braid and straight-line program groups. Several databases of groups are also included.
* Number theory
: Magma contains asymptotically fast algorithms for all fundamental integer and polynomial operations, such as the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm for fast multiplication of integers and polynomials. Integer factorization algorithms include the Elliptic Curve Method, the Quadratic sieve and the Number field sieve.
* Algebraic number theory
: Magma includes the KANT computer algebra system for comprehensive computations in algebraic number fields. A special type also allows one to compute in the algebraic closure of a field.
* Module theory and linear algebra
: Magma contains asymptotically fast algorithms for all fundamental dense matrix operations, such as Strassen multiplication.
* Sparse matrices
: Magma contains the structured Gaussian elimination and Lanczos algorithms for reducing sparse systems which arise in index calculus methods, while Magma uses Markowitz pivoting for several other sparse linear algebra problems.
* Lattices and the LLL algorithm
: Magma has a provable implementation of &quot;fp&quot;LLL, which is an LLL algorithm for integer matrices which uses floating point numbers for the Gram–Schmidt coefficients, but such that the result is rigorously proven to be LLL-reduced.
* Commutative algebra and Gröbner bases
: Magma has an efficient implementation of the Faugère F4 algorithm for computing Gröbner bases.
* Representation theory
: Magma has extensive tools for computing in representation theory, including the computation of character tables of finite groups and the Meataxe algorithm.
* Invariant theory
: Magma has a type for invariant rings of finite groups, for which one can primary, secondary and fundamental invariants, and compute with the module structure.
* Lie theory
* Algebraic geometry
* Arithmetic geometry
* Finite incidence structures
* Cryptography
* Coding theory
* Optimization

<doc id="98630" wikidata="Q6296418" url="?curid=98630" title="President of South Korea">
<text>The president of the Republic of Korea (), also known as the president of Korea (), is both the head of state and head of government of the Republic of Korea. The president is directly elected by the citizens of the Republic of Korea and pledges to execute the duties of their office, chief among others &quot;to defend the State, (and to) pursue peaceful unification of the homeland.&quot; The president leads the State Council, is the chief of the executive branch of the national government and the commander-in-chief of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces.

The Constitution of South Korea and the amended Presidential Election Act of 1987 provide for election of the president by direct, secret ballot, ending sixteen years of indirect presidential elections under the preceding two authoritarian governments. The president is directly elected to a five-year term, with no possibility of re-election. If a presidential vacancy should occur, a successor must be elected within sixty days, during which time presidential duties are to be performed by the prime minister or other senior cabinet members in the order of priority as determined by law. The president is exempt from criminal liability (except for insurrection or treason).

The current president, Yoon Suk Yeol, a former prosecutor general and member of the conservative People Power Party, assumed office on 10 May 2022, after defeating the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee Lee Jae-myung with a narrow 48.5% plurality in the 2022 South Korean presidential election. However, he was impeached on 14 December 2024, suspending his powers; Prime Minister Han Duck-soo served briefly as acting president until his own impeachment on 27 December 2024, leading Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok to assume the role of acting president.

==History==

Prior to the establishment of the First Republic in 1948, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea established in Shanghai in September 1919 as the continuation of several governments proclaimed in the aftermath of March First Movement earlier that year coordinated resistance against Japanese rule. The legitimacy of the Provisional Government has been recognized and succeeded by South Korea in the latter&#x27;s original Constitution of 1948 and the current Constitution of 1987.

The presidential term has been set at five years since 1988. It was previously set at four years from 1948 to 1972, six years from 1972 to 1981, and seven years from 1981 to 1988. Since 1981, the president has been barred from re-election.

==Powers and duties of the president==
Chapter 3 of the South Korean constitution states the duties and the powers of the president. The president is required to:
* uphold the Constitution
* preserve the safety and homeland of South Korea
* work for the peaceful reunification of Korea, typically act as the Chairperson of the Peaceful Unification Advisory Council

Also, the president is given the powers:
* as the head of the executive branch of government
* as the commander-in-chief of the South Korean military
* to declare war
* to hold referendums regarding issues of national importance
* to issue executive orders
* to issue medals in honor of service for the nation
* to issue pardons
* to declare a state of emergency suspending all laws or enacting a state of martial law
* to veto bills (subject to a two thirds majority veto override by the National Assembly)

If the National Assembly votes against a presidential decision, it will be declared void immediately.

The president may refer important policy matters to a national referendum, declare war, conclude peace and other treaties, appoint senior public officials, and grant amnesty (with the concurrence of the National Assembly). In times of serious internal or external turmoil or threat, or economic or financial crises, the president may assume emergency powers &quot;for the maintenance of national security or public peace and order.&quot; Emergency measures may be taken only when the National Assembly is not in session and when there is no time for it to convene. The measures are limited to the &quot;minimum necessary&quot;.

The 1987 Constitution removed the 1980 Constitution&#x27;s explicit provisions that empowered the government to temporarily suspend the freedoms and rights of the people. However, the president is permitted to take other measures that could amend or abolish existing laws for the duration of a crisis. It is unclear whether such emergency measures could temporarily suspend portions of the Constitution itself. Emergency measures must be referred to the National Assembly for concurrence. If not endorsed by the assembly, the emergency measures can be revoked; any laws that had been overridden by presidential order regain their original effect. In this respect, the power of the legislature is more vigorously asserted than in cases of ratification of treaties or declarations of war, in which the Constitution simply states that the National Assembly &quot;has the right to consent&quot; to the president&#x27;s actions. In a change from the 1980 Constitution, the 1987 Constitution stated that the president is not permitted to dissolve the National Assembly.

==Election==

The presidential election rules are defined by the South Korean Constitution and the Public Official Election Act. The president is elected by direct popular vote, conducted using first-past-the-post.

===Latest election===

==Related constitutional organs==
The president is assisted by the staff of the Presidential Secretariat, headed by a cabinet-rank secretary general. Apart from the State Council, or cabinet, the chief executive relies on several constitutional organs.

These constitutional organs included the National Security Council, which provided advice concerning the foreign, military, and domestic policies bearing on national security. Chaired by the president, the council in 1990 had as its statutory members the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the ministers for foreign affairs, home affairs, finance, and national defense, the director of the Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP) which was known as the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) until December 1980, and others designated by the president. Another important body is the Peaceful Unification Advisory Council, inaugurated in June 1981 under the chairmanship of the president. From its inception, this body had no policy role, but rather appeared to serve as a government sounding board and as a means to disburse political rewards by providing large numbers of dignitaries and others with titles and opportunities to meet periodically with the president and other senior officials.

The president also was assisted in 1990 by the Audit and Inspection Board. In addition to auditing the accounts of all public institutions, the board scrutinized the administrative performance of government agencies and public officials. Its findings were reported to the president and the National Assembly, which itself had broad powers to inspect the work of the bureaucracy under the provisions of the Constitution. Board members were appointed by the president.

One controversial constitutional organ was the Advisory Council of Elder Statesmen, which replaced a smaller body in February 1988, just before Roh Tae Woo was sworn in as president. This body was supposed to be chaired by the immediate former president; its expansion to eighty members, broadened functions, and elevation to cabinet rank made it appear to have been designed, as one Seoul newspaper said, to &quot;preserve the status and position of a certain individual.&quot; The government announced plans to reduce the size and functions of this body immediately after Roh&#x27;s inauguration. Public suspicions that the council might provide former President Chun with a power base within the Sixth Republic were rendered moot when Chun withdrew to an isolated Buddhist temple in self-imposed exile in November 1988.

==Removal==
The procedure for impeachment is set out in the Constitution. According to Article 65 Clause 1, if the President, Prime Minister, or other state council members violate the Constitution or other laws of official duty, the National Assembly can impeach them.

Clause 2 states the impeachment bill must be proposed by one third and approved by a majority of members of the National Assembly for passage. In the case of the President, the motion must be proposed by a majority and approved by a supermajority of two thirds or more of the total members of the National Assembly, meaning that 200 of 300 members of the National Assembly must approve the bill. This article also states that any person against whom a motion for impeachment has been passed shall be suspended from exercising power until the impeachment has been adjudicated, and a decision on impeachment shall not extend further than removal from public office. However, impeachment shall not exempt the person impeached from civil or criminal liability for such violations.

By the Constitutional Court Act, the Constitutional Court must make a final decision within 180 days after it receives any case for adjudication, including impeachment cases. If the respondent has already left office before the pronouncement of the decision, the case is dismissed.

Four presidents have been impeached since the establishment of the Republic of Korea in 1948. Roh Moo-hyun in 2004 was impeached by the National Assembly, but the impeachment was overturned by the Constitutional Court. Park Geun-hye was impeached by the National Assembly in 2016, and the impeachment was confirmed by the Constitutional Court on March 10, 2017. Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached by the National Assembly on 14 December 2024. Han Duck-soo became the first acting president to be impeached on 27 December 2024. Although Han held presidential powers, the National Assembly considered him a cabinet minister, allowing him to be removed by a simple majority rather than the two-thirds required of previous presidents.

==Presidential office==
The Cheong Wa Dae () or Blue House was built upon a Joseon-era royal garden. It is a complex of multiple buildings built largely in the traditional Korean architectural style with some modern architectural elements and facilities. Cheong Wa Dae consists of the Main Office Hall &quot;Bon-gwan&quot;, the Presidential Residence, the State Reception House &quot;Yeongbin-gwan&quot;, and several other buildings and structures. The entire complex covers approximately 250,000 square metres or 62 acres. While the Blue House served as an executive office, it was one of the most protected official residences in Asia.

Upon the inauguration of President Yoon Suk Yeol in May 2022, Cheong Wa Dae was relieved of its duties as the official residence and executive office of the president and fully converted to a public park. The president&#x27;s office and residence was moved to the Office of the President of South Korea (formerly the Ministry of National Defense building) in the Yongsan District of Seoul.

==Compensation and privileges of office==
As of 2021, the president receives a salary of ₩240,648,000 along with an undisclosed expense account to cover travel, goods and services while in office.

In addition, the presidency of the republic maintains the &quot;Chongri Gonggwan&quot; (&quot;Official Residence of the Prime Minister&quot;) and the Prime Ministers Office in Seoul. The Chongri Gonggwan is the prime minister&#x27;s official residence and official workplace. The prime minister is allowed use of all other official government offices and residences.

The president also has many regional offices especially in the major cities ready to receive the president at any time. Although not residences, they are owned by the national government and are used when the president is in the region or city.

For ground travel the president uses a highly modified Hyundai Nexo SUV to serve as the presidential state vehicle. For air travel the president uses a highly modified plane which is a military version of the Boeing 747-8 with the call sign Code One and a highly modified helicopter which is a military version of the Sikorsky S-92 that serves as the presidential helicopter.

==Post-presidency==
All former presidents receive a lifelong pension and Presidential Security Service detail. Unlike the prime minister, a former president cannot decline PSS protection. In recent years, South Korean presidents tend to have controversial post-presidencies; four of the last six have served time in prison.

Impeached presidents are stripped of their post-presidential benefits such as pension, free medical services, state funding for post-retirement offices, personal assistants and a chauffeur, and right to burial at the Seoul National Cemetery after death.

<doc id="98631" wikidata="Q2644728" url="?curid=98631" title="Pubic Wars">
<text>The Pubic Wars, a pun on the Punic Wars, was a rivalry between the American men&#x27;s magazines &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot; during the 1960s and 1970s. Each magazine strove to show just a little bit more nudity on their female models than the other, without getting too crude. The term was coined by &quot;Playboy&quot; owner Hugh Hefner. In 1950s and 1960s United States, it was generally agreed that nude photographs were not pornographic unless they showed pubic hair or genitals. Mainstream mass-market photography was careful to come close to this line without stepping over it. Consequently, the depiction of pubic hair was &quot;de facto&quot; forbidden in U.S. pornographic magazines of the era.

==History==
&quot;Penthouse&quot; originated in 1965 in Britain and was initially distributed in Europe. In September 1969, it was launched in the U.S., bringing new competition to &quot;Playboy,&quot; which had dominated the niche since its 1953 debut. Due to more liberal European attitudes to nudity, &quot;Penthouse&quot; was already displaying pubic hair at the time of its U.S. launch. According to Penthouse magazine&#x27;s owner Bob Guccione, &quot;We began to show pubic hair, which was a big breakthrough.&quot;

In order to retain its market share, &quot;Playboy&quot; followed suit, risking obscenity charges, and launching the &quot;Pubic Wars&quot;. &quot;Playboy&quot; started showing wisps of pubic hair about nine months after &quot;Penthouse&quot; (June 1970). As competition between the two magazines escalated, their photo shoots became increasingly explicit. &quot;Playboy&quot;, however, had actually first showed a very slight glimpse of any pubic hair on Melodye Prentiss&#x27; centerfold (Miss July 1968), some 15 years after the magazine&#x27;s introduction. With Playboy Playmates, it was usually the case that the pubic area would be obscured by an item of clothing, a leg, or a piece of furniture. The first appearance of real pubic hair in &quot;Playboy&quot; actually occurred in August 1969 in a pictorial featuring dancer/actress Paula Kelly. A few more glimpses of pubic hair appeared in some later pictorials and centerfolds, but it was not until January 1971 when Liv Lindeland showed clearly visible pubic hair in her pictorial. The first Playmate to clearly have the first full frontal nude centerfold was Miss January 1972, Marilyn Cole. Both went on to become Playmate of the Year, respectively 1972 and 1973. When &quot;Hustler&quot; was launched in 1974, it outdid both &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot; in explicitness by showing more graphic photos of the female sex organs.

Eventually, the two magazines moved their content in opposite directions. &quot;Playboy&quot; positioned itself as the less explicit softcore alternative to be &quot;read for the articles&quot;. &quot;Penthouse&quot; gravitated towards raunchier images, ultimately arriving at hardcore pornography and photographs of women urinating, in the mid-1990s. Under new ownership since 2004, &quot;Penthouse&quot; began to steer toward a more softcore direction as well.

<doc id="98634" wikidata="Q171684" url="?curid=98634" title="Syngman Rhee">
<text>Syngman Rhee (, ; 26 March 1875 – 19 July 1965) also known as Rhee Syng-man, was a South Korean politician who served as the first president of South Korea from 1948 to 1960. Rhee is also known by his art name Unam (). Rhee was also the first and last president of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea from 1919 to his impeachment in 1925 and from 1947 to 1948. As president of South Korea, Rhee&#x27;s government was characterised by authoritarianism, limited economic development, and in the late 1950s growing political instability and public opposition.

Born in Hwanghae Province, Joseon, Rhee attended an American Methodist school, where he converted to Christianity. He became a Korean independence activist and was imprisoned for his activities in 1899. After his release in 1904, he moved to the United States, where he obtained degrees from American universities and met President Theodore Roosevelt. After a brief 1910–12 return to Korea, he moved to Hawaii in 1913. In 1919, following the Japanese suppression of the March First Movement, Rhee joined the right-leaning Korean Provisional Government in exile in Shanghai. From 1918 to 1924, he served as the first President of the Korean Provisional Government until he was impeached in 1925. He then returned to the United States, where he advocated and fundraised for Korean independence. In 1939, he moved to Washington, DC. In 1945, he was returned to US-controlled Korea by the US military, and on July 20, 1948 he was elected the first president of the Republic of Korea by the National Assembly, ushering in the First Republic of Korea.

As president, Rhee continued his hardline anti-communist and pro-American views that characterized much of his earlier political career. Early on in his presidency, his government put down the Jeju uprising on Jeju Island, and the Mungyeong and Bodo League massacres were committed against suspected communist sympathisers, leaving at least 100,000 people dead. Rhee was president during the outbreak of the Korean War (1950–1953), in which North Korea invaded South Korea. He refused to sign the armistice agreement that ended the war, wishing to have the peninsula reunited by force.

After the fighting ended, South Korea&#x27;s economy lagged behind North Korea&#x27;s and was heavily reliant on US aid. After being re-elected in 1956, he pushed to modify the constitution to remove the two-term limit, despite opposition protests. He was reelected uncontested in March 1960, after his opponent Chough Pyung-ok died from cancer before the election took place. After Rhee&#x27;s ally Lee Ki-poong won the corresponding vice-presidential election by a wide margin, the opposition rejected the result as rigged, which triggered protests. These escalated into the student-led April Revolution, in which police shot demonstrators in Masan. The resulting scandal caused Rhee to resign on 26 April, ushering in the Second Republic of Korea. Despite this, protesters continued to converge on the presidential palace, leading to the CIA covertly evacuating him on 28 April by helicopter. He spent the rest of his life in exile in Honolulu, Hawaii, and died of a stroke in 1965.

== Early life and career ==
=== Early life ===
Syngman Rhee was born on 26 March 1875 as Rhee Syng man in Daegyeong, a village in Pyeongsan County, Hwanghae Province, Joseon. Rhee was the third but only surviving son out of three brothers and two sisters (his two older brothers both died in infancy) in a rural family of modest means. Rhee&#x27;s family traced its lineage back to King Taejong of Joseon. He was a 16th-generation descendant of Grand Prince Yangnyeong through his second son, Yi Heun who was known as Jangpyeong Dojeong (장평도정;長平都正). This case makes him a distant relative of the mid-Joseon military officer, Yi Sun-sin (not be confused with Admiral Yi Sun-sin). His mother was a member of Gimhae Kim clan.

In 1877, at the age of two, Rhee and his family moved to Seoul, where he had traditional Confucian education in various &quot;seodang&quot; in Nakdong () and Dodong (). When Rhee was six years old a smallpox infection rendered him virtually blind until he was treated with western medicine, possibly by a Japanese doctor. Rhee was portrayed as a potential candidate for the &quot;gwageo&quot;, the traditional Korean civil service examination, but in 1894 reforms abolished the &quot;gwageo&quot; system, and in April he enrolled in the (), an American Methodist school, where he converted to Christianity. Rhee studied English and &quot;sinhakmun&quot; (). Near the end of 1895, he joined a Hyeopseong (Mutual Friendship) Club () created by Seo Jae-pil, who returned from the United States after his exile following the Gapsin Coup. He worked as the head and the main writer of the newspapers &#x27; and &#x27;, the latter being the first daily newspaper in Korea. During this period, Rhee earned money by teaching the Korean language to Americans. In 1895, Rhee graduated from Pai Chai School.

=== Independence activities ===
Rhee became involved in anti-Japanese circles after the end of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895, which saw Joseon passed from the Chinese sphere of influence to the Japanese. Rhee was implicated in a plot to take revenge for the assassination of Empress Myeongseong, the wife of King Gojong who was assassinated by Japanese agents (known in Korean history as the ); however, a female American physician Georgiana E. Whiting helped him avoid the charges by disguising him as her patient and go to his sister&#x27;s house. Rhee acted as one of the forerunners of the Korean independence movement through grassroots organizations such as the Hyeopseong Club and the Independence Club. Rhee organized several protests against corruption and the influences of the Japan and the Russian Empire. As a result, in November 1898, Rhee attained the rank of &quot;Uigwan&quot; () in the Imperial Legislature, the Jungchuwon ().

After entering civil service, Rhee was implicated in a plot to remove King Gojong from power through the recruitment of Park Yeong-hyo. As a result, Rhee was imprisoned in the Gyeongmucheong Prison () in January 1899. Other sources place the year arrested as 1897 and 1898. Rhee attempted to escape on the 20th day of imprisonment but was caught and was sentenced to life imprisonment through the Pyeongniwon (). He was imprisoned in the Hanseong Prison (). In prison, Rhee translated and compiled &quot;The Sino–Japanese War Record&quot; (), wrote &quot;The Spirit of Independence&quot; (), compiled the &quot;New English–Korean Dictionary&quot; () and wrote in the &quot;Imperial Newspaper&quot; (). He was also tortured. Examples of this included Japanese officers lighting oil paper which were pushed up his fingernails, and then smashing them one-by-one.

=== Political activities at home and abroad ===

In 1904, Rhee was released from prison at the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War with the help of Min Young-hwan. In November 1904, with the help of Min Yeong-hwan and Han Gyu-seol (), Rhee moved to the United States. In August 1905, Rhee and Yun Byeong-gu () met with US President Theodore Roosevelt at peace talks in Portsmouth, New Hampshire and attempted unsuccessfully to convince the US to help preserve independence for Korea.

Rhee continued to stay in the United States; this move has been described as an &quot;exile&quot;. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts from George Washington University in 1907, and a Master of Arts from Harvard University in 1908. In 1910, he obtained a PhD from Princeton University with the thesis &quot;Neutrality as influenced by the United States&quot; ().

In August 1910, Rhee returned to Japanese-occupied Korea. He served as a YMCA coordinator and missionary. In 1912, Rhee was implicated in the 105-Man Incident, and was shortly arrested. However, he fled to the United States in 1912 with M. C. Harris&#x27;s rationale that Rhee was going to participate in the general meeting of Methodists in Minneapolis as the Korean representative.

In the United States, Rhee attempted to convince Woodrow Wilson to help the people involved in the 105-Man Incident, but failed to bring any change. Soon afterwards, he met Park Yong-man, who was in Nebraska at the time. In February 1913, as a consequence of the meeting, he moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, and took over the Han-in Jung-ang Academy (). In Hawaii, he began to publish the &quot;Pacific Ocean Magazine&quot; (). In 1918, he established the Han-in Christian Church (). During this period, he opposed Park Yong-man&#x27;s stance on foreign relations of Korea and brought about a split in the community. In December 1918, he was chosen, along with Dr. Henry Chung DeYoung, as a Korean representative to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 by the Korean National Association but they failed to obtain permission to travel to Paris. After giving up travelling to Paris, Rhee held the First Korean Congress in Philadelphia with Seo Jae-pil to make plans for future political activism concerning Korean independence.

Following the March First Movement in March 1919, Rhee discovered that he was appointed to the positions of foreign minister for the (a group in Vladivostok), prime minister for the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai, and a position equivalent to president for the . In June, in the acting capacity of the President of the Republic of Korea, he notified the prime ministers and the chairmen of peace conferences of Korea&#x27;s independence. On 25 August, Rhee established the Korean Commission to America and Europe () in Washington, DC. On 6 September, Rhee discovered that he had been appointed acting president for the Provisional Government in Shanghai. From December 1920 to May 1921, he moved to Shanghai and was the acting president for the Provisional Government.

However, Rhee failed to efficiently act in the capacity of Acting President due to conflicts inside the provisional government in Shanghai. In October 1920, he returned to the US to participate in the Washington Naval Conference. During the conference, he attempted to set the problem of Korean independence as part of the agenda and campaigned for independence but was unsuccessful. In September 1922, he returned to Hawaii to focus on publication, education, and religion. In November 1924, Rhee was appointed the position of president for life in the Korean Comrade Society ().

In March 1925, Rhee was impeached as the president of the Provisional Government in Shanghai over allegations of misuse of power and was removed from office. Nevertheless, he continued to claim the position of president by referring to the Hanseong Provisional Government and continued independence activities through the Korean Commission to America and Europe. In the beginning of 1933, he participated in the League of Nations conference in Geneva to bring up the question of Korean independence.

In November 1939, Rhee and his wife left Hawaii for Washington, DC. He focused on writing the book &quot;Japan Inside Out&quot; and published it during the summer of 1941. With the attack on Pearl Harbor and the consequent Pacific War, which began in December 1941, Rhee used his position as the chairman of the foreign relations department of the provisional government in Chongqing to convince President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the United States Department of State to approve the existence of the Korean provisional government. As part of this plan, he cooperated with anti-Japan strategies conducted by the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS). In 1945, he participated in the United Nations Conference on International Organization as the leader of the Korean representatives to request the participation of the Korean provisional government.

==Presidency (1948–1960)==


===Return to Korea and rise to power===
After the surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945, Rhee was flown to Tokyo aboard a US military aircraft. Over the objections of the Department of State, the US military government allowed Rhee to return to Korea by providing him with a passport in October 1945, despite the refusal of the Department of State to issue Rhee with a passport. The British historian Max Hastings wrote that there was &quot;at least a measure of corruption in the transaction&quot; as the OSS agent Preston Goodfellow who provided Rhee with the passport that allowed him to return to Korea was apparently promised by Rhee that if he came to power, he would reward Goodfellow with commercial concessions.&quot; Following the independence of Korea and a secret meeting with Douglas MacArthur, Rhee was flown in mid-October 1945 to Seoul aboard MacArthur&#x27;s personal airplane, &quot;The Bataan&quot;.

After the return to Korea, he assumed the posts of president of the Independence Promotion Central Committee (), chairman of the Korean People&#x27;s Representative Democratic Legislature, and president of the Headquarters for Unification (). At this point, he was strongly anti-communist and opposed foreign intervention; he opposed the Soviet Union and the United States&#x27; proposal in the 1945 Moscow Conference to establish a trusteeship for Korea and the cooperation between the left-wing (communist) and the right-wing (nationalist) parties. He also refused to join the US-Soviet Joint Commission () as well as the negotiations with the north.
For decades, the Korean independence movement was torn by factionalism and in-fighting, and most of the leaders of the independence movement hated each other as much as they hated the Japanese. Rhee, who had lived for decades in the United States, was a figure known only from afar in Korea, and therefore regarded as a more or less acceptable compromise candidate for the conservative factions. More importantly, Rhee spoke fluent English, whereas none of his rivals did, and therefore he was the Korean politician most trusted and favored by the American occupation government. The British diplomat Roger Makins later recalled, &quot;the American propensity to go for a man rather than a movement — Giraud among the French in 1942, Chiang Kai-shek in China. Americans have always liked the idea of dealing with a foreign leader who can be identified as &#x27;their man&#x27;. They are much less comfortable with movements.&quot; Makins further added the same was the case with Rhee, as very few Americans were fluent in Korean in the 1940s or knew much about Korea, and it was simply far easier for the American occupation government to deal with Rhee than to try to understand Korea. Rhee was &quot;acerbic, prickly, uncompromising&quot; and was regarded by the US State Department, which long had dealings with him as &quot;a dangerous mischief-maker&quot;, but the American General John R. Hodge decided that Rhee was the best man for the Americans to back because of his fluent English and his ability to talk with authority to American officers about American subjects. Once it became clear from October 1945 onward that Rhee was the Korean politician most favored by the Americans, other conservative leaders fell in behind him.
When the first US–Soviet Cooperation Committee meeting was concluded without a result, he began to argue in June 1946 that the government of Korea must be established as an independent entity. In the same month, he created a plan based on this idea and moved to Washington, DC, from December 1946 to April 1947 to lobby support for the plan. During the visit, Harry S. Truman&#x27;s policies of Containment and the Truman Doctrine, which was announced in March 1947, enforced Rhee&#x27;s anti-communist ideas.

In November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly recognized Korea&#x27;s independence and established the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK) through Resolution 112. In May 1948, the South Korean Constitutional Assembly election was held under the oversight of the UNTCOK. He was elected without competition to serve in the South Korean Constitutional Assembly () and was consequently selected to be Speaker of the Assembly. Rhee was highly influential in creating the policy stating that the president of South Korea had to be elected by the National Assembly. The 1948 Constitution of the Republic of Korea was adopted on 17 July 1948.
On 20 July 1948, Rhee was elected president of the Republic of Korea in the 1948 South Korean presidential election with 92.3% of the vote; the second candidate, Kim Ku, received 6.7% of the vote. On 15 August the Republic of Korea was formally established in the south, and Rhee was inaugurated as its first president. The next month, on 9 September, the north also proclaimed statehood as the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea. Rhee&#x27;s relations with the &quot;chinilpa&quot; Korean elites who had collaborated with the Japanese were, in the words of the South Korean historian Kyung Moon Hwang, often &quot;contentious&quot;, but in the end an understanding was reached in which, in exchange for their support, Rhee would not purge the elites. In particular, the Koreans who had served in the colonial-era National Police, whom the Americans had retained after August 1945, were promised by Rhee that their jobs would not be threatened by him. Upon independence in 1948, 53% of South Korean police officers were men who had served in the National Police during the Japanese occupation.

=== Cabinet ===
=== Political repression ===
Soon after taking office, Rhee enacted laws that severely curtailed political dissent. There was much controversy between Rhee and his leftist opponents. Allegedly, many of the leftist opponents were arrested and in some cases killed. The most controversial issue has been Kim Ku&#x27;s assassination. On 26 June 1949, Kim Ku was assassinated by Ahn Doo-hee, who confessed that he had been acting on the orders of Kim Chang-ryong. Ahn Doo-hee was described by the British historian Max Hastings as one of Rhee&#x27;s &quot;creatures&quot;. It soon became apparent that Rhee&#x27;s style of government was rigidly authoritarian. He allowed the internal security force (headed by his right-hand man, Kim Chang-ryong) to detain and torture suspected communists and North Korean agents. His government also oversaw several massacres, including the suppression of the Jeju uprising on Jeju Island, of which South Korea&#x27;s Truth Commission reported 14,373 victims, 86% at the hands of the security forces and 13.9% at the hands of communist rebels, and the Mungyeong Massacre.

By early 1950, Rhee had about 30,000 alleged communists in his jails, and had about 300,000 suspected sympathizers enrolled in an official &quot;re-education&quot; movement called the Bodo League. When the North Korean army attacked in June, retreating South Korean forces executed the prisoners, along with several tens of thousands of Bodo League members.

=== Korean War ===
Both Rhee and Kim Il Sung wanted to unite the Korean peninsula under their respective governments, but the United States refused to give South Korea any heavy weapons, to ensure that its military could only be used for preserving internal order and self-defense. By contrast, Pyongyang was well equipped with Soviet aircraft, vehicles and tanks. According to John Merrill, &quot;the war was preceded by a major insurgency in the South and serious clashes along the thirty-eighth parallel,&quot; and 100,000 people died in &quot;political disturbances, guerrilla warfare, and border clashes&quot;.

At the outbreak of war on 25 June 1950, North Korean troops launched a full-scale invasion of South Korea. All South Korean resistance at the 38th parallel was overwhelmed by the North Korean offensive within a few hours. By 26 June, it was apparent that the Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA) would occupy Seoul. Rhee stated, &quot;Every Cabinet member, including myself, will protect the government.&quot; At midnight on 28 June, the South Korean military destroyed the Han Bridge, preventing thousands of citizens from fleeing. On 28 June, North Korean soldiers occupied Seoul.

During the North Korean occupation of Seoul, Rhee established a temporary government in Busan and created a defensive perimeter along the Naktong Bulge. A series of battles ensued, which would later be known collectively as the Battle of Naktong Bulge. After the Battle of Inchon in September 1950, the North Korean military was routed, and the United Nations Command (UNC) and South Korean forces not only liberated all of South Korea, but overran much of North Korea. In the areas of North Korea taken by the UNC forces, elections were supposed to be administered by the United Nations but instead were taken over and administered by the South Koreans. Rhee insisted on &quot;Bukjin Tongil&quot; – ending war by conquering North Korea, but after the Chinese entered the war in November 1950, the UNC forces were thrown into retreat. During this period of crisis, Rhee ordered the December massacres of 1950. Rhee was absolutely committed to reunifying Korea under his leadership and strongly supported MacArthur&#x27;s call for going all-out against China, even at the risk of provoking a nuclear war with the Soviet Union.

Hastings notes that, during the war, Rhee&#x27;s official salary was equal to $37.50 per month. Both at the time and since, there has been much speculation about precisely how Rhee managed to live on this amount. The entire Rhee regime was notorious for its corruption, with everyone in the government from the President downwards stealing as much they possibly could from both the public purse and from United States aid. The Rhee regime engaged in the &quot;worst excesses of corruption&quot;, with South Korean soldiers going unpaid for months as their officers embezzled their pay, equipment provided by the United States being sold on the black market, and the size of the army being bloated by hundreds of thousands of &quot;ghost soldiers&quot; who only existed on paper, allowing their officers to steal pay that would have been due had these soldiers actually existed. The problems with low morale experienced by the army were largely due to the corruption of the Rhee regime. The worst scandal during the war—indeed of the entire Rhee government—was the National Defense Corps Incident. Rhee created the National Defense Corps in December 1950, intended to be a paramilitary militia, comprising men not in the military or police who were drafted into the corps for internal security duties. In the months that followed, tens of thousands of National Defense Corps men either starved or froze to death in their unheated barracks, as the men lacked winter uniforms and food. Even Rhee could not ignore the deaths of so many and ordered an investigation. It was revealed that the commander of the National Defense Corps, General Kim Yun Gun, had stolen millions of American dollars that were intended to heat the barracks and feed and clothe the men. Kim and five other officers were publicly shot at Daegu on 12 August 1951, following their convictions for corruption.

In the spring of 1951, Rhee—who was upset about MacArthur&#x27;s dismissal as UNC commander by President Truman—lashed out in a press interview against Britain, whom he blamed for MacArthur&#x27;s sacking. Rhee declared, &quot;The British troops have outlived their welcome in my country.&quot; Shortly after, Rhee told an Australian diplomat about the Australian troops fighting for his country, &quot;They are not wanted here any longer. Tell that to your government. The Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and British troops all represent a government which is now sabotaging the brave American effort to liberate fully and unify my unhappy nation.&quot;

During the Korean War armistice negotiations, one of the most contentious issues was the repatriation of prisoners of war (POWs). The United Nations Command advocated for the principle of voluntary repatriation, allowing POWs to choose whether to return to their home countries. In contrast, the communist side insisted on mandatory repatriation, demanding that all POWs be returned regardless of their preferences. This disagreement prolonged the negotiations, and an agreement was only reached on June 8, 1953.
However, South Korean President Rhee Syngman strongly opposed the armistice, fearing it would leave South Korea vulnerable to future aggression and believing it failed to ensure the country’s long-term security. On June 18, 1953, Rhee unilaterally ordered the release of over 27,000 anti-communist POWs held in camps across South Korea, including those in Busan, Masan, and Daegu. This action shocked the United States, the United Nations, and the communist side, as it was perceived as a direct challenge to the ongoing armistice talks. The release also led to casualties, with dozens of POWs reportedly killed or injured during the process.
Rhee’s decision to release the POWs is interpreted as serving multiple purposes. Domestically, it was framed as a gesture to grant freedom to anti-communist prisoners who refused to return to their communist home countries. Internationally, it was a bold political maneuver to assert South Korea’s agency in the armistice process and to pressure the United States into committing to South Korea&#x27;s defense. Rhee was deeply dissatisfied with the armistice negotiations being conducted without active participation from the South Korean government. His actions aimed to ensure South Korea’s security through the signing of the Korea-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty.
Although the unilateral release of POWs temporarily disrupted the armistice talks, it ultimately strengthened South Korea’s position in post-war negotiations. The Korea-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty was signed shortly after the armistice, guaranteeing U.S. military support for South Korea and solidifying its defense against future aggression.

On July 27, 1953, the Korean War, often referred to as &quot;one of the 20th century&#x27;s most vicious and frustrating wars,&quot; ended without a clear victor. The Korean Armistice Agreement was signed by military commanders representing China, North Korea, and the United Nations Command (UNC), led by the United States. However, the Republic of Korea (ROK), under President Syngman Rhee’s leadership, refused to sign the agreement. Rhee strongly opposed the armistice, fearing it would cement the division of Korea and leave the South vulnerable to future attacks.
Despite intense pressure from the United States and its allies, Rhee remained steadfast in his objections, demanding stronger security guarantees and a commitment to South Korea&#x27;s defense. Although the armistice succeeded in halting active hostilities, it was not a formal peace treaty. To this day, no peace treaty has been signed, leaving the Korean Peninsula in a technical state of war. The armistice established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) as a buffer between North and South Korea, yet tensions remained high.
Rhee’s opposition to the armistice was part of his broader geopolitical strategy. He sought to secure a long-term U.S. military presence in South Korea to deter future attacks and to strengthen the South’s position in the region. His refusal to endorse the armistice eventually led to the signing of the Korea-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty in October 1953, which guaranteed U.S. military support for South Korea and cemented its role as a key ally in East Asia during the Cold War.

=== Re-election ===
Because of widespread discontent with Rhee&#x27;s corruption and political repression, it was considered unlikely that Rhee would be re-elected by the National Assembly. To circumvent this, Rhee attempted to amend the constitution to allow him to hold elections for the presidency by direct popular vote. When the Assembly rejected this amendment, Rhee ordered a mass arrest of opposition politicians and then passed the desired amendment in July 1952. During the following presidential election, he received 74% of the vote.

=== Post-war economic challenges ===
At the time of its creation in 1948, South Korea was among the poorest countries in the world. Twelve years later, in 1960, it held this position with a per capita income similar to that of Haiti. Although South Korea was predominantly an agricultural society that had experienced some industrialization during the Japanese colonial rule from 1910 to 1945, mainly in the northern provinces, it faced significant challenges.

The division of Korea in 1945 by the Soviet Union and the United States resulted in the creation of two states: the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea in the north and the Republic of Korea in the south. The DPRK inherited most of the industry, mining, and more than 80% of electricity generation. In contrast, the ROK owned the majority of productive agricultural areas, but these were barely enough to feed a densely populated and rapidly growing population.

The period after the war was marked by a very slow recovery, despite South Korea being one of the largest per capita recipients of foreign aid. The lack of central planning, minimal investment in infrastructure, poor use of aid funds, government corruption, political instability, and the threat of renewed war with the North made the country very unattractive to both domestic and foreign investors. Additionally, the fear of recreating a colonial dependence on Japan prevented Seoul from opening the country to trade and investment with its prosperous neighbor.

=== Resignation and exile ===
After the war ended in July 1953, South Korea struggled to rebuild following nationwide devastation. The country remained at a Third World level of development and was heavily reliant on US aid. Rhee was easily re-elected for what should have been the final time in 1956, since the 1948 constitution limited the president to two consecutive terms. However, soon after being sworn in, he had the legislature amend the constitution to allow the incumbent president to run for an unlimited number of terms, despite protests from the opposition.

In March 1960, the 84-year-old Rhee won his fourth term in office as president. His victory was assured with 100% of the vote after the main opposition candidate, Cho Byeong-ok, died shortly before the 15 March elections.

Rhee wanted his protégé, Lee Ki-poong, elected as Vice President—a separate office under Korean law at that time. When Lee, who was running against Chang Myon (the ambassador to the United States during the Korean War, a member from the opposition Democratic Party) won the vote with a wide margin, the opposition Democratic Party claimed the election was rigged. This triggered anger among segments of the Korean populace on 19 April. When police shot demonstrators in Masan, the student-led April Revolution forced Rhee to resign on 26 April.

On 28 April 1960, a DC-4 belonging to the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), piloted by Captain Harry B. Cockrell Jr. and operated by Civil Air Transport, covertly flew Rhee out of South Korea as protesters converged on the Blue House. During the flight, Rhee and Francesca Donner, his Austrian wife, went to the cockpit to thank the pilot and crew. Rhee&#x27;s wife offered the pilot a valuable diamond ring in thanks, which was courteously declined. The former president, his wife, and their adopted son subsequently lived in exile in Honolulu, Hawaii.

== Death ==
Rhee died of stroke complications in Honolulu on 19 July 1965. A week later, his body was returned to Seoul and buried in the Seoul National Cemetery.

== Personal life ==
Rhee was married to Seungseon Park from 1890 to 1910. Park divorced Rhee shortly after the death of their son Rhee Bong-su in 1908, supposedly because their marriage had no intimacy due to his political activities.

In February 1933, Rhee met Austrian Franziska Donner in Geneva. At the time, Rhee was participating in a League of Nations meeting and Donner was working as an interpreter. In October 1934, they were married in New York City. She also acted as his secretary.

Over the years after the death of Bong-su, Rhee adopted three sons. The first was Rhee Un-soo, however, the elder Rhee ended the adoption in 1949. The second adopted son was Lee Kang-seok, eldest son of Lee Ki-poong, who was a descendant of Prince Hyoryeong and therefore a distant cousin of Rhee; but Lee committed suicide in 1960. After Rhee was exiled, Rhee In-soo, who is a descendant of Prince Yangnyeong just like Rhee, was adopted by him as his heir.

== Legacy ==
Rhee&#x27;s former Seoul residence, Ihwajang, is currently used for the presidential memorial museum. The Woo-Nam Presidential Preservation Foundation has been set up to honor his legacy. There is also a memorial museum located in Hwajinpo near Kim Il Sung&#x27;s cottage.

Rhee imbued South Korea with a legacy of authoritarian rule that lasted with only a few short breaks until 1988. One of those breaks came when the country adopted a parliamentary system with a figurehead president in response to Rhee&#x27;s abuses. This Second Republic would only last a year before being overthrown in a 1961 military coup. In spite of this, however, the ensuing president Park Chung Hee expressed criticism of Rhee&#x27;s regime, in particular for its lack of focus on economic and industrial development. Beginning with the Park era, the standing of Rhee and his &quot;diplomatic&quot; faction of the Korean independence movement fell in the public consciousness in favor of Kim Ku and Ahn Jung-geun, who embodied the &quot;armed resistance&quot; faction of the right-wing independence movement, who were preferred by Park; Kim&#x27;s son Kim Shin and Ahn&#x27;s nephew both cooperated with the Park regimes of the Third and Fourth Republic.

Rhee began to be reevaluated after democratization in 1987, and in particular came to be associated with the so-called New Right movement, some members of which have argued that Rhee&#x27;s achievements have been wrongly undervalued, and that he should be viewed positively as the founding father of the Republic of Korea. An early and prominent example of such literature was Volume 2 of &quot;Re-Understanding the History of Pre- and Post-Liberation&quot; (), published in 2006 by various &quot;New Right&quot; scholars. This academic dispute formed one of the germs behind the later history textbook controversies in the country.

In any event, this view has not spread much beyond the right-wing, with a 2023 Gallup Korea survey finding that only 30% of respondents saying that Rhee &quot;did many good things&quot;, versus 40% who thought that he &quot;did many wrong things&quot; and 30% who had no opinion or didn&#x27;t respond. Moreover, only about half of conservative party supporters, as well as half of self-described conservatives, gave the first response.

<text>Roh Tae-woo (, ; 4 December 1932 – 26 October 2021) was a South Korean army general and politician who served as the sixth president of South Korea from 1988 to 1993. He was the first democratically elected president of South Korea.

Born in Daegu, Roh attended the Korea Military Academy alongside his close friend Chun Doo-hwan. Rising steadily through the ranks, he saw action in the Vietnam War, and by 1979 he was a major general and commanded the White Horse Division. In that capacity, Roh played a key role in the December 1979 military coup that brought Chun to power, and supported Chun&#x27;s violent crackdown of the Gwangju Uprising in 1980. Retiring from the army a year later, he held a series of ministerial posts in Chun&#x27;s government.

In June 1987, Chun handpicked Roh as the candidate of the ruling Democratic Justice Party in the upcoming presidential election, which effectively handed Roh the presidency. The announcement triggered large pro-democracy rallies across the country that came to be known as the June Democratic Struggle. In response, Roh worked to distance himself from the Chun government and delivered the June 29 Declaration, promising a broad program of democratic reforms including the direct election of the president. He won the election in December with a plurality and was inaugurated on 25 February 1988.

As president, Roh reaffirmed his commitment to the continuing democratization of South Korean politics. He oversaw the merger of his Democratic Justice Party with Kim Young-sam&#x27;s Reunification Democratic Party and Kim Jong-pil&#x27;s New Democratic Republican Party to form the Democratic Liberal Party. Shortly after inauguration, he presided over the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. In foreign affairs, Roh pursued the policy of Nordpolitik and established diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union and China. Relations with North Korea improved during his presidency, and the two Koreas were simultaneously admitted into the United Nations in 1991. Barred from running for a second term, Roh was succeeded by Kim Young-sam in 1993.

In 1996, Roh and Chun were convicted for corruption as well as their roles in the 1979 coup and the Gwangju massacre; Roh was sentenced to 17 years in prison while Chun was given a life sentence. Both were pardoned the following year by President Kim Young-sam on advice of incoming President-elect Kim Dae-jung. Roh died on 26 October 2021, at the age of 88.

==Early life and education==
Roh was born on 4 December 1932 in Daegu. His ancestry could be traced from Jinan, capital of Shandong, China and is the 16th generation descendant of who was a civil minister and scholar during early Joseon period. Noh Sa-sin is 6th generation descendant of the late Goryeo period bureaucrat Noh Jin (). His father, a low-echelon civil officer in the district, died in a car accident when Roh was seven years old. With his uncle&#x27;s help, Roh first enrolled at the Daegu Technical School but transferred to the local Kyongbuk High School where he was an above-average student. Roh befriended Chun Doo-hwan while in high school in Daegu.

==Military service==
During the Korean War (1950–1953), Roh joined the South Korean army as an enlisted conscript in an artillery unit, alongside singer Song Hae. He was promoted to Sergeant Cannoneer of an M114 155 mm howitzer gun line.

He later entered the Korean Military Academy (KMA), completing it in the first class of the four-year program, he graduated in February 1954 with a Bachelor of Science degree and a commission as an Army 2nd Lieutenant in the 11th class of the KMA.

A commissioned officer in the infantry from 1954, Roh rose steadily through the ranks and fought in the Vietnam War, first in 1968 as a lieutenant colonel and battalion commander, later was promoted to major general and the commander of White Horse Division in 1979. A member of the Hanahoe, a secret military group, he gave critical support to a Coup d&#x27;état of December Twelfth 1979 in which Chun became the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of South Korea. Roh helped Chun suppress the Gwangju Uprising in May 1980.

Roh held several key army posts such as Commander of the Capital Security Command in 1979 and Commander of the Defense Security Command in 1980.

When Roh first joined the military, his surname was transcribed in English as &quot;No.&quot; He later changed it to &quot;Roh&quot; to avoid the negative connotations of &quot;No&quot; in English.

==Political career==
===Cabinet minister===
Following his retirement from the Army in July 1981, Roh accepted Chun&#x27;s offer of the post of Minister of State for National Security and Foreign Affairs. Later, he served as Sports Minister, Home Affairs Minister, President of the Seoul Olympics Organizing Committee, and in 1985, chairman of the ruling Democratic Justice Party. Most notably, he oversaw preparations for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, which he officially declared open.

===June 29 Declaration and run for presidency===

Despite his involvement in the coup d&#x27;état of December 12 and the bloody military crackdown of dissidents in the Gwangju Uprising and with an eye on the Blue House in the upcoming 1987 presidential elections, Roh began working to distance himself from the unpopular Chun government. Roh worked to carry out his own agenda for democratic reform. By agreeing to meeting the demands of the political opposition in terms of political reforms with his eight-point proposal including direct election of the President, Roh successfully upstaged Chun and boosted his own image as a reformer.

In June 1987, Chun named Roh as the presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Justice Party. This was widely perceived as handing Roh the presidency, and triggered large pro-democracy rallies in Seoul and other cities in the 1987 June Democracy Movement.

In response, Roh made a speech on 29 June promising a wide program of reforms. Chief among them were a new, more democratic constitution and popular election of the president. In the election, the two leading opposition figures, Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung (both of whom later became presidents), were unable to overcome their differences and they split the vote. This enabled Roh to win by a narrow margin with 36.6% of the vote and become the country&#x27;s first democratically elected president on 16 December 1987.

==Presidency (1988–1993)==
Roh was inaugurated as president on 25 February 1988. For the first time, the ceremony was held outside the National Assembly. Subsequent presidents have been inaugurated at the same location. In his inauguration speech, Roh pledged to open an era of democracy, bringing into full play the people&#x27;s potential.

Roh&#x27;s rule was notable for hosting the Seoul Olympics in 1988 and for his foreign policy of Nordpolitik, which represented a major break from previous administrations. True to his word, he remained committed to democratic reforms and was steadfast in the push toward political and socio-economic reforms at home. Democratization of politics, economic &quot;growth with equity,&quot; and national reunification were the three policy goals publicly stated by the Roh administration.

However, in 1992, Roh&#x27;s government sealed up a cave on Mount Halla where the remains of the Jeju uprising massacre victims had been discovered, continuing a series of coverups by successive administrations on the truth of the uprising.

===Merging of political parties in 1990===
In order to overcome the paralysis of governing due to lack of majority support in the National Assembly, the Roh government sought to attain &quot;a grand compromise&quot; in partisan politics. A party merger was announced on 22 January 1990 in an attempt to accomplish this political objective. The ruling Democratic Justice Party merged with two opposition parties, Kim Young-sam&#x27;s Reunification and Democracy Party and Kim Jong-pil&#x27;s New Democratic Republican Party. The new established Democratic Liberal Party, which commanded a more than two-thirds majority in the legislature, sought to establish political stability so as to enable socio-economic progress. However, the merger was fraught with factional infighting, undermining his administration&#x27;s handling on national affairs.

===Foreign policy===

He met with President Corazon Aquino for a series of talks between the Philippines and South Korea for economic, social, and cultural ties, supporting the Filipino boxer Leopoldo Serantes in the Olympics, and to discuss unification talks to end North Korea&#x27;s hostility after the Korean War.

During his administration, Roh&#x27;s stance as President was very active in diplomacy. Successfully hosting the 24th Summer Olympics in Seoul in his first year in office was a major accomplishment, followed by his active diplomacy, including his address before the United Nations General Assembly in October 1988, his meeting with U.S. President George H. W. Bush, and delivering a speech before a joint session of the U.S. Congress. He also conducted a five-nation European visit in December 1989.

On 7 July 1988, he launched an aggressive foreign policy initiative called the Northern Diplomacy, or Nordpolitik, which brought about benefits and rewards to his government. In 1989, Seoul established diplomatic relations with Hungary and Poland, followed by diplomatic ties with Yugoslavia, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Mongolia in 1990. South Korea&#x27;s trade with the People&#x27;s Republic of China steadily increased, reaching the $3.1 billion mark at the same time South Korea&#x27;s trade with the Eastern Bloc nations and the Soviet Union increased to $800 million. Seoul and Moscow exchanged full consular general&#x27;s offices in 1990. Roh&#x27;s moves left North Korea more isolated and was a dramatic and historic turning point of South Korea&#x27;s diplomatic goals.

On 4 June 1990, Roh met with Mikhail Gorbachev, President of the Soviet Union, during a visit to the United States. The meeting ended 42 years of official silence between the two countries and paved the way for improved diplomatic relations. Roh later visited the Soviet Union in 1991.

===North Korean relations===
The Nordpolitik policy also proposed the interim development of a &quot;Korean Community&quot;, which was similar to a North Korean proposal for a confederation.

From 4 to 7 September 1990, high-level talks were held in Seoul, at the same time that the North was protesting about the Soviet Union normalizing relations with the South. In December 1991 both states made an accord, the Agreement on Reconciliation, Non-Aggression, Exchange and Cooperation, pledging non-aggression and cultural and economic exchanges. They also agreed on prior notification of major military movements and established a military hotline, and working on replacing the Korean Armistice Agreement with a &quot;peace regime&quot;. The agreement was praised for forming a foundation for cross-border exchanges and cooperation.

In January 1992, North and South Korea also signed the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, although the North subsequently reneged and pursued its own nuclear weapons program. This coincided with the admission of both North and South Korea into the United Nations. Meanwhile, on 25 March 1991, a unified Korean team, for the first time, used the Korean Unification Flag at the World Table Tennis Competition in Japan, and on 6 May 1991, a unified team competed at the World Youth Football Competition in Portugal.

===Economy and infrastructure===
Roh&#x27;s emphasis on &quot;economic growth with equity,&quot; although well received by the public, led to the dwindling in the annual economic growth rate from the high of 12.3 percent in 1988 to 6.7 percent in 1989. As labor strikes and demands for higher wages intensified, the Roh government imposed an austerity plan to keep South Korea&#x27;s export-oriented economy more competitive internationally. However, pursuit of higher wages in the wake of the strikes and the appreciation of the South Korean won in value against the U.S. dollar made South Korean products less competitive internationally.

His policies cancelled debt in rural areas, constructed two million new houses, and established public land ownership for the public interest. In addition, under his administration, large-scale national projects such as Incheon International Airport opened in 2001 and the Korea Train Express (KTX) high speed rail system opened in 2004. Both of these began construction under his administration in 1992.

==Post-presidency (1993–2021)==
Barred from running for a second term in 1992 (the 1987 constitution retained the previous ban on reelection), Roh left office on 24 February 1993.

===Trial, jail sentence and pardon===
In 1993, Roh&#x27;s successor Kim Young-sam led an anti-corruption campaign that investigated Roh and Chun. Kim had previously merged his party with Roh&#x27;s in a deal that enabled him to win the election. Kim&#x27;s administration also officially recognised the 12 December incident as a coup.

In October 1995, Roh, in a tearful televised speech, publicly apologized for having illegally amassed hundreds of millions of dollars in secret political donations during his term as president. Roh was arrested in November 1995 on charges of bribery. The two former presidents were also later separately charged with mutiny and treason for their roles in the 1979 coup and the 1980 Gwangju massacre.

The &quot;trial of the century&quot;, as described by the media, saw both convicted in August 1996 for treason, mutiny, and corruption; Chun was sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment, while Roh&#x27;s 22½-year jail sentence was reduced to 17 years on appeal. Both were released from prison in December 1997 and pardoned by Kim Young-sam on advice of president-elect Kim Dae-jung. Both Roh and Chun attended Kim Dae-jung&#x27;s inauguration on 25 February 1998.

In March 2006, Roh was also stripped of 11 national honours which he previously received.

Roh finished repaying fines from his illegally gained wealth in 2013. In 2013, the remaining W24 billion (USD22 million) of a W262.9 billion fine for corruption in office was paid. He mostly stayed out of politics and maintained a low profile in retirement, and he continued to express remorse over his crimes until his death in 2021. In 2019, two years before Roh&#x27;s death, his son went to Gwangju and visited the May 18th National Cemetery on behalf of his father. Roh&#x27;s son visited the cemetery a second time in 2020, and he offered a flower wreath under his father&#x27;s name. In contrast, his friend and predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan stopped repaying his remaining fine and did not show regret or remorse for his past actions.

===Health (2002–2021)===
Roh suffered from prostate cancer and received surgery in 2002. He also suffered from cerebellar atrophy and asthma. His son, Roh Jae-heon who is a lawyer based in the United States, said that Roh spent most of his final 10 years of his life in the hospital, while his daughter Roh Soh-yeong, an art museum director, said he was bedridden for the past 10 years and unable to speak or move his body. On 12 August 2014, while confinement at the Seoul National University Hospital, Roh was visited by his predecessor and friend Chun Doo-hwan.

==Death and state funeral==
Roh died in intensive care at the Seoul National University Hospital at 1:45pm KST on 26 October 2021, at the age of 88. His family released his last will and message:

In view of Roh&#x27;s mixed and disputed legacy, the government decided to hold a state funeral for Roh following a debate within the national cabinet, in recognition of his &quot;significant contributions to the nation&#x27;s development&quot;. The decision was criticized by some, including survivors and victims&#x27; families of the Gwangju massacre and members of the ruling liberal Democratic Party. The city of Gwangju and several other cities and provincial governments refused to raise flags half-mast or set up memorial altars for Roh in accordance with state funeral procedures. In Seoul, memorial altars saw a low turnout of mourners coming to pay their respects.

The scaled-down state funeral service, held in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, took place at Olympic Park, Seoul on 30 October, in recognition of the 1988 Summer Olympics which was successfully held there under his presidency. Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum gave a eulogy. By law, Roh was not eligible for burial at a national cemetery because of his past criminal record and conviction. On 9 December 2021, two months after his death, Roh&#x27;s ashes were interred at Paju, a border town to North Korea, on .

He died about one month before Chun died on 23 November 2021 from complications of blood cancer.

<text>Peterborough Cathedral, properly the Cathedral Church of St Peter, St Paul and St Andrew, and formerly known as Peterborough Abbey or St Peter&#x27;s Abbey, is a cathedral in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, in the United Kingdom. The seat of the Anglican Bishop of Peterborough, it is dedicated to the Apostles Saint Peter, Saint Paul, and Saint Andrew, whose statues look down from the three high gables of the West Front. Founded in the Anglo-Saxon period as a minster it became one of England&#x27;s most important Benedictine abbeys, becoming a cathedral only in 1542. Its architecture is mainly Norman, following a rebuilding in the 12th century. Alongside the cathedrals of Durham and Ely, it is one of the most important 12th-century buildings in England to have remained largely intact, despite extensions and restoration, and is one of the nation&#x27;s best preserved pre-Reformation abbeys. 

Peterborough Cathedral is known for its imposing Early English Gothic West Front (façade) which, with its three enormous arches, is without architectural precedent and with no direct successor. The appearance is slightly asymmetrical, as one of the two towers that rise from behind the façade was never completed (the tower on the right as one faces the building), but this is only visible from a distance.

==History==

===Anglo-Saxon origins===

The original church, known as &quot;Medeshamstede&quot;, was founded in the reign of the Anglo-Saxon King Peada of the Middle Angles in about 655 AD, as one of the first centres of Christianity in central England. The monastic settlement with which the church was associated lasted at least until 870, when it was supposedly destroyed by Vikings. In an alcove of the New Building, an extension of the eastern end, lies an ancient stone carving: the Hedda Stone. This medieval carving of 12 monks, six on each side, commemorates the destruction of the Monastery and the death of the Abbot and Monks when the area was sacked by the Vikings in 864. The Hedda Stone was likely carved sometime after the raid, when the monastery slipped into decline.

In the mid-10th century, monastic revival (during which churches at Ely and Ramsey were also refounded) a Benedictine Abbey was created and endowed in 966, principally by Athelwold, Bishop of Winchester, from what remained of the earlier church, with &quot;a basilica [church] there furbished with suitable structures of halls, and enriched with surrounding lands&quot; and more extensive buildings which saw the aisle built out to the west with a second tower added. The original central tower was, however, retained. It was dedicated to St Peter and surrounded by a palisade, called a burgh, hence the town surrounding the abbey was eventually named Peter-burgh. The community was further revived in 972 by Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury.

This newer church had as its major focal point a substantial western tower with a &quot;Rhenish helm&quot; and was largely constructed of ashlars. Only a small section of the foundations of the Anglo-Saxon church remain beneath the south transept but there are several significant artefacts, including Anglo-Saxon carvings such as the Hedda Stone, from the earlier building.

In 2008, Anglo-Saxon grave markers were reported to have been found by workmen repairing a wall in the cathedral precincts. The grave markers are said to date to the 11th century, and probably belonged to &quot;townsfolk&quot;.

===Norman and medieval architectural evolution===
Although damaged during the struggle between the Norman invaders and local folk-hero, Hereward the Wake, it was repaired and continued to thrive until destroyed by an accidental fire in 1116. This event necessitated the building of a new church in the Norman style, begun by Abbot John de Sais on 8 March 1118 (Old Style). By 1193, the building was completed to the western end of the Nave, including the central tower and the decorated wooden ceiling of the nave. The ceiling, completed between 1230 and 1250, still survives. It is unique in Britain and one of only four such ceilings in the whole of Europe. It has been over-painted twice, once in 1745, then in 1834, but still retains the character and style of the original. (The painted nave ceiling of Ely Cathedral, by contrast, is entirely a Victorian creation.)

The church was largely built of Barnack limestone from quarries on its own land, and it was paid annually for access to these quarries by the builders of Ely Cathedral and Ramsey Abbey in thousands of eels (e.g. 4,000 each year by Ramsey). Cathedral historians believe that part of the placing of the church in the location it is in is due to the easy ability to transfer quarried stones by river and then to the existing site allowing it to grow without being relocated.

Then, after completing the Western transept and adding the Great West Front Portico in 1237, the medieval masons switched over to the new Gothic style. Apart from changes to the windows, the insertion of a porch to support the free-standing pillars of the portico and the addition of a &quot;new&quot; building at the east end around the beginning of the 16th century, the structure of the building remains essentially as it was on completion almost 800 years ago. The completed building was consecrated in 1238 by Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln, within whose diocese it then fell.

The trio of arches forming the Great West Front, the defining image of Peterborough Cathedral, is unrivalled in medieval architecture. The line of spires behind it, topping an unprecedented four towers, evolved for more practical reasons. Chief amongst them was the wish to retain the earlier Norman towers, which became obsolete when the Gothic front was added. Instead of being demolished and replaced with new stretches of wall, these old towers were retained and embellished with cornices and other gothic decor, while two new towers were added to create a continuous frontage.

The Norman tower was rebuilt in the Decorated Gothic style in about 1350–1380 (its main beams and roof bosses survive) with two tiers of Romanesque windows combined into a single set of Gothic windows, with the turreted cap and pinnacles removed and replaced by battlements. Between 1496 and 1508, the Presbytery roof was replaced and the &quot;New Building&quot;, a rectangular building built around the end of the Norman eastern apse, with Perpendicular fan vaulting (probably designed by John Wastell, the architect of King&#x27;s College Chapel, Cambridge and the Bell Harry Tower at Canterbury Cathedral), was added.

===Monastic life===

As in all Benedictine abbeys, the monks of Peterborough made vows of stability in the abbey until death. The community was governed by the Rule of St Benedict and was focused chiefly on the daily services of the Conventual Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours in the church. Meals and meetings were also important ritual events, with monks eating in silence while listening to readings from spiritual texts. Outside of this schedule they engaged in scholarship, education, pastoral care for the local community, and other kinds of work with daily time set aside for recreation, an opportunity to socialise with other members of the community and with guests. The duty of welcoming guests and pilgrims is a cornerstone of the Benedictine Rule and at Peterborough this was probably the primary focus of activity.

Pilgrimage to Peterborough was common because of the abbey&#x27;s many relics. The existing mid-12th-century records of Hugh Candidus, a monk, list the Abbey&#x27;s reliquaries as including two pieces of swaddling clothes which wrapped the baby Jesus, pieces of Jesus&#x27; manger, a part of the five loaves which fed the 5,000, a piece of the raiment of Mary the mother of Jesus, a piece of Aaron&#x27;s rod, and relics of St Peter, St Paul and St Andrew – to whom the church is dedicated.

The supposed arm of Oswald of Northumbria disappeared from its chapel, probably during the Reformation, despite a watch-tower having been built for monks to guard its reliquary. Various contact relics of Thomas Becket were brought from Canterbury in a special reliquary by its Prior Benedict (who had witnessed Becket&#x27;s assassination) when he was &quot;promoted&quot; to Abbot of Peterborough.

These items underpinned the importance of what is today Peterborough Cathedral. At the zenith of its wealth just before the Reformation it had the sixth-largest monastic income in the country and was one of the most powerful communities in the English Benedictine Congregation. It had a 120 monks, including all the standard roles of a monastic community such as the almoner, the infirmarian, the sacristan and the cellarer, and many more dependant lay brothers and employees.

===Tudor===
In 1541, following Henry VIII&#x27;s dissolution of the monasteries, the relics were lost. The church survived by being selected as the cathedral of the Anglican Diocese of Peterborough. The last Abbot of Peterborough, John Chambers, became the first Bishop of Peterborough. Henry&#x27;s former wife, Catherine of Aragon, had been buried there in 1536. Her tomb was damaged in 1643 and restored in the 19th century. To this day, her grave is honoured by visitors who decorate it with flowers and pomegranates (her symbol). The gold letters at the site read &quot;Katharine Queen of England&quot;, a title she was denied at the time of her death. A festival to commemorate the Queen is held yearly.

In 1587, the body of Mary, Queen of Scots was initially buried here after her execution at nearby Fotheringhay Castle, but it was later removed to Westminster Abbey on the orders of her son, King James VI of Scotland and James I of England.

===Civil War to present===

The cathedral was vandalised during the English Civil War in 1643 by Parliamentarian troops. As was common at the time, almost all the stained glass and the medieval choir stalls were destroyed, and the high altar and reredos were demolished, as were the cloisters and Lady Chapel. All the monuments and memorials of the Cathedral were also damaged or destroyed.

Some of the damage was repaired during the 17th and 18th centuries. Extensive restoration work began in 1883, which was initiated after large cracks appeared in the supporting pillars and arches of the main tower. These works included rebuilding of the central tower and its foundations, interior pillars, the choir and re-enforcements of the west front under the supervision of John Loughborough Pearson. New hand-carved choir stalls, cathedra (bishop&#x27;s throne), choir pulpit and the marble pavement and high altar were added. A stepped level of battlements was removed from the central tower, reducing its height slightly.

The cathedral was hit by a fire on the early evening of 22 November 2001; it is thought to have been started deliberately amongst plastic chairs stored in the North Choir Aisle. The fire was spotted by one of the vergers allowing a swift response by emergency services. The timing was particularly unfortunate, for a complete restoration of the painted wooden ceiling was nearing completion. The oily smoke given off by the plastic chairs was particularly damaging, coating much of the building with a sticky black layer. The seat of the fire was close to the organ and the combination of direct damage from the fire, and the water used to extinguish necessitated a full-scale rebuild of the instrument, putting it out of action for several years.

An extensive programme of repairs to the west front began in July 2006 and has cost in excess of half a million pounds. This work is concentrated around the statues located in niches which have been so badly affected by years of pollution and weathering that, in some cases, they have only stayed intact thanks to iron bars inserted through them from the head to the body. The programme of work has sought donors to &quot;adopt a stone&quot;.

The sculptor Alan Durst was responsible for some of the work on the statues on the West Front.

<text>Crayola LLC, formerly the Binney &amp; Smith Company, is an American manufacturing and retail company specializing in art supplies. It is known for its brand &quot;Crayola&quot; and best known for its crayons. The company is headquartered in Forks Township, Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley region of the state. Since 1984, Crayola has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Hallmark Cards.

Originally an industrial pigment supply company, Crayola soon shifted its focus to art products for home and school use, beginning with chalk, then crayons, followed later by colored pencils, markers, paints, modeling clay, and other related goods. All Crayola-branded products are marketed as nontoxic and safe for use by children. Most Crayola crayons are manufactured in the United States.

Crayola also produces Silly Putty and a line of professional art products under the &#x27;Portfolio Series brand&#x27;, including acrylics, watercolor, tempera, and brushes.

Crayola LLC claims the Crayola brand has 99% name recognition in U.S. consumer households, and says its products are marketed and sold in over 80 countries.

==History==
The company was founded as Binney &amp; Smith Company by cousins Edwin Binney and Charles Smith in New York City in 1885. Initial products were colorants for industrial use, including red iron oxide pigments used in barn paint and carbon black chemicals used for making tires black and extending their useful lifespan. Binney &amp; Smith&#x27;s new process of creating inexpensive black colorants was entered into the chemistry industries competition at the 1900 Paris Exposition under the title &quot;carbon gas blacks, lamp or oil blacks, &#x27;Peerless&#x27; black&quot; and earned the company a gold medal award in chemical and pharmaceutical arts. Also in 1900, the company added production of slate school pencils. Binney&#x27;s experimentation with industrial materials, including slate waste, cement, and talc, led to the invention of the first dustless white chalk, for which the company won a gold medal at the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair.

Initially formed as a partnership, Binney &amp; Smith incorporated in 1902, and in that year Binney &amp; Smith developed and introduced the Staonal marking crayon. Then Edwin Binney, working with his wife, Alice Stead Binney, developed his own famous product line of wax crayons beginning on June 10, 1903, which it sold under the brand name Crayola. The &quot;Crayola&quot; name was coined by Alice Binney who was a former schoolteacher. It comes from &quot;craie&quot; (French for &quot;chalk&quot;) and &quot;ola&quot; for &quot;oleaginous&quot; or &quot;oily.&quot; The suffix &quot;-ola&quot; was also popular in commercial use at the time, lending itself to products such as granola (1886), pianola (1901), Victrola (1905), Shinola (1907), and Mazola (1911). Crayola introduced its crayons not with one box, but with a full product line. By 1905, the line had expanded to offering 18 different-sized crayon boxes with five different-sized crayons, only two of which survive today—the &quot;standard size&quot; (a standard sized Crayola crayon is ) and the &quot;large size&quot; (large sized Crayola crayons are ). The product line offered crayon boxes containing 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24, 28, or 30 different color crayons. Some of these boxes were targeted for artists and contained crayons with no wrappers, while others had a color number printed on the wrapper that corresponded to a number on a list of color names printed inside the box lid, but some boxes contained crayons with their color names printed on their wrappers.

The Rubens Crayola line, started in 1903, was directly targeted at artists and designed to compete with the Raphael brand of crayons from Europe. The crayon boxes sold from five cents for a No.6 Rubens box containing six different-colored crayons to $1.50 for the No. 500 Rubens Special Artists and Designers Crayon box containing 24 different-colored, larger () crayons.
In April 1904 at the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair, Binney &amp; Smith won the Golden Medal for their An-Du-Septic dustless chalk. Subsequently, Crayola used the opportunity to develop a new packaging strategy by emphasizing their gold medal on the front of many of their products and crayon boxes. This strategy turned out to be so successful and recognizable to their brand that they phased out nearly all of their other Crayola line box designs to adapt to the gold medal format, which appeared on their packaging for the next 50-plus years.

In 1905, the prototype offering of their new No. 8 crayon box (with eight crayons) featured a copy from the side of the medal with an eagle on it. This was changed to the other side of the medal with the 1904 date on it in Roman numerals.

Binney &amp; Smith purchased the Munsell Color Company crayon product line in 1926, and inherited 22 new colors, 11 in the maximum and 11 in the middle hue ranges. They retained the Munsell name on products such as “Munsell-Crayola” and “Munsell-Perma” until 1934, and then incorporated their colors into their own Crayola Gold Medal line of boxes.

In 1939, Crayola, by combining its existing crayon colors with the Munsell colors, introduced its largest color assortment product to date; a &quot;No. 52 Drawing Crayon 52 Color Assortment&quot;, which was retired by the 1944 price list.

In 1949, Crayola introduced the &quot;Crayola No. 48&quot; containing 48 color crayons in a non-hangable floor box.

Further expansion took place in 1958 with the introduction of the 64-color pack that included the company&#x27;s first crayon sharpener built into the box. The 64-color box was called &quot;a watershed&quot; moment in the history of the Crayola crayon by Smithsonian National Museum of American History curator David Shayt.
The corporation became a publicly traded company under the symbol BYS on the American Stock Exchange in 1963, and later moved to the New York Stock Exchange under the same symbol in 1978.

In 1977, Binney &amp; Smith acquired the rights to Silly Putty, a stretchy, bouncy silicon rubber compound. Crayola markers were introduced in 1978 to coincide with the 75th anniversary of Crayola crayons. In 1984, the company was acquired by Hallmark Cards, a privately held corporation. Colored pencils and a line of washable markers were added in 1987.

In August 1997, Crayola collaborated with Alliance Atlantis and the entertainment arm of Hallmark Cards to release three direct-to-video adaptations of famous children&#x27;s novels under the name Crayola Kids Adventures.

Crayola Crayons were inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong in Rochester, New York, in 1998. On January 1, 2007, Binney &amp; Smith reorganized as Crayola LLC, to reflect the company&#x27;s number one brand.

In 2011, My First Crayola was launched. Products include triangular crayons and flat-tipped markers.

In 2015, Crayola announced &quot;Color Escapes&quot; for adults to help them relieve stress. The kit includes four collections, such as geometric, garden, natural, and kaleidoscope.

==Crayons==
Crayola crayon packs vary in package counts of just a few crayons sold to establishments such as hotels and restaurants, to hand out to their young guests, to 832-crayon &quot;Classpack&quot; bulk boxes marketed to schools. The colors contained in a package have ranged from two to 200 (although a 200-color package includes &quot;special effect&quot; crayons such as glitters, neons, etc).

The most common retail packages are multiples of eight, with 8, 16, 24, 48, 64, 96 and 120 packs being marketed today. A 150-crayon pack featuring a plastic telescope-like case was introduced in 2006, and includes 118 regular color crayons, 16 glitter crayons, and 16 &quot;Metallic FX&quot; crayons, as well as a built-in sharpener at the apex of the tower. This was succeeded by a 152-crayon set in a plastic yellow carrying case in 2013, with all the colors from the 150-crayon set plus the standard colors Piggy Pink and Blue Bell.

===Colors===

As the size of Crayola crayon packs increased from the original 1903 crayon packs, the variety of colors available has also increased—reaching 120 colors by 1998. Since 1998, new colors have been added, but always replacing existing colors. In all, 14 colors have been retired, bringing the total number of regular colors produced to 134. On March 31, 2017, Crayola announced that Dandelion would be retired. On September 14, 2017, the replacement color &quot;Bluetiful&quot; was announced. The color is reportedly a new hue realized after experiments done at Oregon State University. It was discovered while scientists were experimenting with electronics.

According to Crayola, they currently manufacture 120 standard crayon colors which are all included in the regular 120-count box. This does not include specialty crayons like the Metallic FX, Gel FX and the glitter crayons, but does include fluorescent crayons.

==== Colors chart ====
The colors in the box below come in the packs of 8, 16, and 24:
In 2020, Crayola introduced a new line of 24 colors named &quot;Colors of the World&quot; to reflect nearly 40 skin tones of people around the world. The box of these crayons included a gradient skin tone label, and for the first time color names were written in French, English, and Spanish.

==Cultural impact==
The Smithsonian National Museum of American History maintains a collection of Crayola crayons founded by an original 64-color box donated by Binney &amp; Smith in 1998. The collection now includes more than 300 boxes of crayons.

The Crayola crayon was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame as a founding member at its inception.

Crayola has been featured in segments from the popular children&#x27;s shows &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, with the official 100 billionth crayon molded by Fred Rogers himself in February 1996 at the plant in Easton.

===Commemorative postage stamp===

In 1998, the United States Postal Service issued a 32-cent postage stamp to commemorate the cultural impact the product has had on almost all Americans.

The stamp is part of the 1900s decade sheet of the Celebrate the Century souvenir sheet series, and was designed by Carl Herrman, illustrated by Richard Waldrep and printed by Ashton-Potter USA using the offset/intaglio process.

===Crayola color census 2000===
In 2000, Crayola held the &quot;Crayola Color Census 2000&quot; promotion in which Americans were asked to vote for their favorite Crayola crayon color. Celebrity entrants George W. Bush chose &quot;Blue Bell&quot;, Tiger Woods chose &quot;Wild Strawberry&quot;, and Courteney Cox chose &quot;Red&quot;. Overall, &quot;Blue&quot; came in first, with &quot;Cerulean&quot; second, and &quot;Purple Heart&quot; third.

===Crayola Experience===

Originally opening as the Crayola Factory, the Crayola Experience is located at 30 Centre Square, Easton, Pennsylvania, at Two Rivers Landing. Open to the public, the Crayola Experience is a roomy, crayon-centric warehouse including events, a café, a store, attractions, some familiarizing guests, and Crayola&#x27;s history with products.

A &quot;discovery center&quot; was built that showcases the manufacturing process of crayons. There is also a &quot;Crayola Hall of Fame&quot; in which the retired crayon colors are displayed.

The Crayola Experience was featured in a Food Network episode of &quot;&quot;. A dinner was held for 150 employees of the Crayola Experience to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 64-box of crayons. Chef Michael Symon&#x27;s mission was to create an eight-course tasting menu for this event, where all eight items of the menu had to match eight randomly chosen Crayola crayon colors.

On October 11, 2003, the Experience unveiled &quot;The World&#x27;s Largest Crayon&quot;, a crayon weighing , as part of its celebration of 100 years of Crayola crayons. The giant crayon, in diameter, is blue, and was made of leftover crayon bits (&quot;leftolas&quot;) sent in by children across the United States.

It opened its first location in Two Rivers Landing, in Easton, Pennsylvania, in May 2013, its second location in The Florida Mall, Orlando, Florida, in June 2015, its third location in Mall of America, Bloomington, Minnesota, in February 2016, its fourth location in The Shops at Willow Bend, Plano, Texas, in March 2018, and its fifth location in Chandler Fashion Center, Chandler, Arizona, in May 2019. With five new locations planned to open by 2027, their sixth location will open in 2025 in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.

<doc id="98643" wikidata="Q7592685" url="?curid=98643" title="St Botolph's Church, Boston">
<text>St Botolph&#x27;s Church is the Anglican parish church of Boston, Lincolnshire, England. It has been referred to as &quot;Boston Stump&quot; since it was constructed. Its tower is tall, and was long used as a landmark for the Boston fishermen; on a clear day it can be seen from Norfolk. The church is a Grade I listed building.

==Background==
The church has one of the tallest medieval towers in the country, with a height of approximately 266 feet 9 inches (81.31m). 

It can be seen for miles around; its prominence accentuated by the flat surrounding countryside known as The Fens. On a clear day, it can be seen from East Anglia on the other side of The Wash. The nickname, Boston Stump (also known as &quot;The Stump&quot;), is often used as a reference to the whole church building or for the parish community housed by it. The formal name is Saint Botolph&#x27;s Parochial Church of Boston. The name &quot;Boston&quot; is thought to have evolved from &quot;Botolph&#x27;s Town&quot;.

==Earlier buildings==
Early English legends say that the church was built on the site of a monastery founded by Saint Botolph in 654. As the main source of this account is the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, it is strongly disputed. Modern historians believe it much more likely that Botolph&#x27;s monastery was located at Iken in Suffolk.

The Boston Stump is not the first church to have been built on this site. Archaeological evidence indicates that a smaller wooden and stone Norman church had existed on the location of the south aisle of the present building. William Stukeley, the 18th-century antiquary, mentions large stone remains to the south of the church. Excavations during the mid 19th century revealed a Norman stone pillar and a number of coffins from the period.

The small church was inadequate for a booming town with trading revenues to rival London. Trade was across the North Sea with the Low Countries. The town also became a theological centre, with no fewer than four religious houses. In the beginning of the 14th century, the parish began work on a much grander building, more fitting for a prosperous town.

Historically, the transformation from a small church to the equivalent of a continental European cathedral was begun in 1309 under Sir John Truesdale, Vicar of St Botolph&#x27;s (‘Sir’ being a title of priests at the time). In this period there was change and upheaval across the continent and England following the arrests of the Knights Templar by King Philip the Fair of France on Friday, 13 October 1307. 

England became a refuge for many individuals with ties on both sides of the channel, and there was a surge in building construction across England. For approximately the next 20 years, theological determination was disputed among the crown, nobility, and clergy in England. Political turmoil from these events led to the Hundred Years&#x27; War and the eventual formation of the Church of England in the 16th century.

==Foundation and architecture==

The existing church was begun in 1309 at the east end, as was customary. With the chancel built, work reached the south aisle and moved on through the nave until its completion around 1390. Foundation trouble, because of proximity to the river, delayed progress while the chancel was extended to prop the building up and create a greater level of structural stability. The nave piers had been leaning dangerously to the east. This work was successful to the extent that today the tower leans by less than half a centimetre, despite its great height.

The tower was not begun until 1450, by excavation of a deep, wide hole. Indicating the architectural skill employed by the builders at the time, the tower remains structurally solid and has not required any restoration work to realign it despite The Haven being only away and the original foundations built under water level.

It was completed between 1510 and 1520 in the Perpendicular style that had become popular during much of the 15th century. A walkway at roughly two thirds of the height of the tower encircles the edges, giving great views from the Wash in the east toward Lincoln in the west. Reached by 209 steps, the walkway also provides access to the tower level with the bells.

The tower is topped with a highly decorated octagonal lantern ringed with pinnacles, one of fewer than half a dozen medieval examples surviving in England. Others, including the church of Bury St Edmunds Abbey, are now ruined.

The nave is long and wide, making the internal space of the building impressive by its sheer size. It terminates in the vaulted chancel containing the high altar at the extreme eastern end of the church. The church was vaulted in wood in the 18th century, but the nave vaults were removed in the 20th century.

The relatively short period of construction for such a large church is fairly unusual in England, and an indication of the wealth of Boston. Most similarly sized churches, largely cathedrals, took hundreds of years to build due to constant fund shortages, giving them a variety of different styles as exhibited by other East Anglian churches, such as Ely or Peterborough. The Stump was built in less than 150 years, giving it a rare sense of architectural coherence and unity.

===Misericords===
St Botolph&#x27;s has an array of sixty-two misericords dating from 1390. Subject matter includes mythology, heraldry, and some everyday scenes - NB-02, for instance &quot;Master seated birching a boy who is trying to protect himself with a book. Three other boys are looking on,&quot; and NB-03 &quot;Two jesters, each squeezing a cat under its arm and biting its tail&quot;.

==Dimensions and statistics==
St Botolph&#x27;s Church is the widest parish church in England, the tallest to roof, and also one of the largest by floor area. The very largest by floor area is Holy Trinity Church in Hull, now known as Hull Minster.

There are many dimensions of the church that correspond with dates in the calendar. The roof is supported by 12 pillars (months), the church has 52 windows (weeks), and 7 doors (days of the week). There are a total of 365 steps to the tip of the tower (days of the year). There are 24 steps to the library (hours) and 60 steps to the roof (minutes and seconds).

==Significance of the tower==

The tower of St Botolph&#x27;s Church is high, making it the tallest parish church in England to its roof. For the last one hundred and thirty odd years, there have only been 26 bells at the Stump: 15 carillon bells, 10 bells hung for full circle ringing, and the sanctuary bell (or 27 if one includes the old ship&#x27;s bell).

The tower was used as a marker for travellers on The Fens and in The Wash. It is commonly believed that it was once lit from inside the tower in order to serve this purpose at night as well as during the day. George Jebb&#x27;s &quot;Guide to the Church of St Botolph, with Notes on the History of Boston&quot; mentions rings in the tower from which lights could be hung, pointing out that it was a popular practice. The accuracy of this reference is not known. Pishey Thompson, in &quot;The History and Antiquities of Boston&quot;, quotes from Britton, editor of &quot;The Lincolnshire Churches, in the Division of Holland&quot;:


The tower became important again in World War II, when Lincolnshire was known as &quot;Bomber County&quot; for its proliferation of air bases. British and American pilots would use The Stump as a signpost to guide them back to base. It also appears that the German Luftwaffe used the tower as a marker, but the town of Boston suffered few bombings.

When floodlighting was recently fitted at The Stump, a great deal of research was done. The yellow lighting of the octagonal lantern was specially put in place to represent the historic use as a marker to guide travellers on land and sea.

===Architectural influence abroad===

In the 1920s, the truncated tower inspired the form of several structures during a resurgence of Gothic Revival buildings in the United States. The spire of Harkness Tower at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut (1921) and Riverside Church (1930) in New York City were the closest exemplars of the original masonry structure. Skyscrapers such as the Chicago Tribune Tower (1925) and New York&#x27;s American Radiator Building (1926) also took formal cues. In Boston, Massachusetts, so named for St Botolph&#x27;s parish, Boston University planned its own &quot;Boston stump&quot; in the form of the Alexander Graham Bell tower, but these plans were never realized.

The official title of the church is &quot;St Botolph&#x27;s Church of the Parish of Boston&quot;, but it is more commonly known as the &quot;Boston Stump&quot;, and more simply by locals &quot;the Stump&quot; ever since it was completed. In what is still a matter of debate, there are a number of believed origins of this nickname that at first applied to the tower and is now frequently used to describe the whole church. What is certain is the real roots have long since faded from memory.

The first is that the tower took so long to build it resembled a stump during the construction phase. Seventy years was not, however, a particularly long time for a tower of such height to be built. Many similarly tall structures would be built a level at a time over hundreds of years.

Secondly, it was intended to be completed with a spire. This seems unlikely, as there has not been a single recorded lantern tower in England that has been topped with a spire. It is possible that a spire was originally intended to rest on the first phase of the tower. It would have looked rather like St James&#x27; Church, Louth.

The third explanation is that it is named after the dramatic appearance it creates rising from the flat fenlands that surround it for miles. Other churches, including Ely Cathedral, also derive nicknames from their appearance when viewed from the Fens.

==Library==

As a centre of learning, St Botolph&#x27;s has a library that is located above the porch. The height of this above ground level is perhaps to protect the precious books contained within from flooding, an event that was frequent when the church was originally built.

The library was re-founded in 1634, as a result of the metropolitical visitation the previous year. The books from that period were mostly donated, with donors&#x27; names recorded on the fly leaf. A later 17th-century vicar left his books to the library, about doubling its size. The bookshelves date from 1766. Indications from the book bindings show the library was not chained, although some books have been held in chained libraries. Catalogues were produced before the Archdeacon got rid of numerous books in 1819.

By 1950 this collection had more than 1,500 volumes. The majority of books (about 1,200) date to the 17th century, but about 150 books were printed before 1600, and there are a small number of incunabula dating from 1501 or earlier. Many of these books are believed to be a gift of Anthony Tuckney (1599–1670), who was vicar when the library was first established.

The most notable titles are a 12th-century manuscript, St Augustine&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on Genesis&quot;, and a 1542 edition of the works of Geoffrey Chaucer. Religious books from the time of the early printing press include the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; from 1549, and also a collection of books by Dutch philosopher and theologian Erasmus, published from 1545 to 1548.

Many sermons were recorded and are held by the library. Some considered to be of political and religious importance were given by preacher Robert Sanderson, a royalist during the English Civil War. At one point, he served as the personal chaplain to King Charles I. Such preachers who combined religion with politics, provided a unique viewpoint into the Royalist mindset.

Although the parish records from before 1900 were moved to Lincoln in 1988 for safe keeping, the parish library remains one of the ten biggest in England today. A dedicated cataloguer has been hired, and the library is being recorded and restored.

==Political climate and its effects==
The Reformation in England resulted in a reduction of the cathedral-like complex. At its peak the church was larger than it is today, including a number of attached buildings: the Corpus Christi Chapel to the south-western edge of the porch, and Charnel House on the eastern side of the nave opposite the Cotton Chapel. Together these extensions created a traditional cruciform shape to the building.

But in 1612 the church was damaged by militant local puritans. This is the year when the present pulpit was erected. Its grand style and prominence indicate the importance accorded to preaching in the time of the Pilgrims. More damage was done by Parliamentary forces during the English Civil War. They are said to have used the church as their camp in 1643. The Parliamentary forces destroyed stained-glass windows that they found politically or religiously offensive, as happened in many other churches in Lincolnshire.

John Cotton was a 17th-century vicar of Boston. A Puritan, he was noted as a preacher and attracted new members to the congregation. He wanted to change the Anglican Church from within, and simplify its liturgy &amp; practice. He moved to Massachusetts in 1633 as a leader of settlers who had already emigrated (some had spent time in the Netherlands for religious freedom), as well as his own followers. He was instrumental in founding and naming Boston, Massachusetts. The &quot;Cotton Chapel&quot; at St Botolph&#x27;s was named for him. At one time it was used as a school, and later as the fire station. It was restored in 1857.

==Restoration==

Early restoration work to repair war damage was carried out during the 17th and the 18th centuries. The organ, lost in the Reformation, was replaced in 1715.

From 1851 to 1853, a major period of Victorian restoration occurred. Nottingham architect George Place worked on the church as lead architect, under the direction of Gilbert Scott. The changes they oversaw included the removal of the tower ceiling and the addition of stone vaulting, as originally featured in the medieval plans. Place was responsible for the design of the east window, based on that of All Saints&#x27; Church, Hawton in Nottinghamshire, and the original design for the choirstall canopies. The high quality of craftmanship at the end of the 19th and the early 20th centuries is demonstrated here, particularly in the carved wood and stained glass. Augustus Welby Pugin created the baptismal font, which dates from 1853.

Between 1929 and 1931, a major restoration project took place under the supervision of Sir Charles Nicholson. The work included replacement of the nave roof and the installation of a new flat wooden ceiling, and strengthening of the tower. That entailed wooden scaffolding being erected up its entire height. Significant financial support for the restoration work came from the citizens of Boston, Massachusetts. The peal of bells in the tower was restored with a new bell frame, increasing the number of bells from eight to ten. This was increased again in 1951 to 15. The bells are now fitted on three racks of five, and were funded by a legacy.

Some restoration work began in 1979 in preparation for the 700th anniversary of the church. This programme, led by architect Nicholas Rank, was expected to cost something in the region of £3 million. In 2005, The Boston Stump Restoration Trust and Development Appeal was launched to carry out restoration and development of Saint Botolph&#x27;s Church. The process of restoring this ancient landmark is underway and to date (2013) has included cleaning and conservation of the tower and West Door, cleaning and restoration of the chancel and Cotton Chapel, and the building of new visitor facilities. The latter were officially opened by Anne, Princess Royal in July 2012.

==Events==
In addition to regular worship services, the church holds regular fundraising events, and events for various schools. Every year, Boston Grammar School celebrates the giving of the Royal Charter to the School by holding a Charter Day service in the church.

The Restoration Trust also holds several fundraising concerts. Artists who have performed at the church include Lesley Garrett, The Black Dyke Band, and The Pontarddulais Male Voice Choir. On 26 June 2013, the Boston Stump Restoration Trust held their annual dinner in the nave in St Botolph&#x27;s Church. In September 2013, the Restoration Trust held a Grand Celebrity Concert with the St Botolph&#x27;s Singers, featuring Caroline Trutz and Special Guest, Aled Jones.

==Environment==
Due to its location in flat, low-lying fenland near the sea, the town of Boston has always been at risk of flooding. The buttress on the south-west corner of the tower has been used since the 18th century for keeping a record of the heights and dates of flooding of the church by the River Witham. Flood defences were improved following the North Sea flood of 1953. The church was flooded in 1978 and again on 5 December 2013, when the North Sea flood of 2013 resulted in of water inside and outside the building.

A folk tale tells that the strong winds blowing around the Stump are caused by the breath of the Devil. After an exhausting struggle with St Botolph, the Devil was breathing so heavily that the wind has not yet died down.

==Present day==
Simon Jenkins, in his book, &quot;England&#x27;s Thousand Best Churches&quot;, ranks St Botolph&#x27;s among the top 18. Architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner describes it is &quot;a giant among English parish churches&quot;.

As befits the size and architectural importance, St Botolph&#x27;s is a member of the Anglican Greater Churches Group, established for the small number of parish churches that have cathedral-like proportions without the title to match.

A full 3D model of the Stump can be viewed on Google Earth.

==Stained-glass windows==
One of the large stained-glass windows commemorates important figures in the history of Boston. The figures represent: Anne of Bohemia, Lady Margaret Beaufort, Anne Bradstreet (who went to New England in 1630 and became America&#x27;s first poet) and Jean Ingelow. The bottom pictures portray John Cotton witnessing the sailing of the &quot;Arbella&quot; in 1630, and Archbishop William Laud and Anthony Tuckney founding the library in 1634.

==Organ==
The church has a large three-manual pipe organ by Harrison &amp; Harrison. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.
In the church&#x27;s early days each of the various guilds had their own organ but the guilds were suppressed in 1547 and by 1589 all existing organs in the church had been disposed of.

The church was subsequently without an organ for more than a century and a quarter during Puritan days, until Christian Smith was engaged to build one in 1717. Some of Smith&#x27;s pipes still survive in the present instrument but, over the years, various builders have had a hand in its development, namely Nicholls, Hill, Bishop, Brindley, Norman &amp; Beard and Henry Willis. The last major rebuild was in 1940 by Harrison &amp; Harrison of Durham. In 1987, Harrisons carried out a restoration making some slight tonal changes and taking advantage of modern solid-state technology to increase the facilities. In April 2007, they carried out some routine maintenance and cleaning, and upgraded the combination capture system to include 64 separate channels. The number of general pistons was increased from three to eight. It has three manuals and pedals, with 41 speaking stops and 12 couplers. The action is electro pneumatic.
The chamber organ is a ‘Premier’ model built by the firm of Cousans (Lincoln) Ltd in the 1960s. It is used for more intimate choral performances, where the main organ is not always appropriate, and with an orchestra, as a &quot;continuo&quot; organ.

<text>The dropper loop is a type of loop knot often used on multi-hook fishing lines. It can be created in the middle of a long line and forms a loop which is off to the side of the line.

== Techniques ==
There are two main methods of tying the dropper loop. 
# Gather a loop and then twist it around the overlap a few times
# Form the loop and then use a matchstick to twist up the overlap.
Finally drop the loop through the central twist.

<text>The Byrds () were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1964. The band underwent multiple lineup changes throughout its existence, with frontman Roger McGuinn (known as Jim McGuinn until mid-1967) being the sole consistent member. Although their time as one of the most popular groups in the world only lasted for a short period in the mid-1960s, the Byrds are considered by critics to be among the most influential rock acts of their era. Their signature blend of clear harmony singing and McGuinn&#x27;s jangly 12-string Rickenbacker guitar sound was &quot;absorbed into the vocabulary of rock&quot; and has continued to be influential.

Initially, the Byrds pioneered the musical genre of folk rock as a popular format in 1965, by melding the influence of the Beatles and other British Invasion bands with contemporary and traditional folk music on their first and second albums and the hit singles &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot; and &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;. As the 1960s progressed, the band was influential in originating psychedelic rock and raga rock, with their song &quot;Eight Miles High&quot; (1966) and the albums &quot;Fifth Dimension&quot; (1966), &quot;Younger Than Yesterday&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot; (1968). The band also played a pioneering role in the development of country rock, with the 1968 album &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; representing their fullest immersion into the genre.

The band&#x27;s original five-piece lineup consisted of McGuinn (lead guitar, vocals), Gene Clark (tambourine, vocals), David Crosby (rhythm guitar, vocals), Chris Hillman (bass guitar, vocals), and Michael Clarke (drums). In early 1966, Clark left due to problems associated with anxiety and his increasing isolation within the group. The Byrds continued as a quartet until late 1967, when Crosby and Clarke also departed. McGuinn and Hillman decided to recruit new members, including country rock pioneer Gram Parsons, but by late 1968, Hillman and Parsons had also exited the band. McGuinn elected to rebuild the band&#x27;s membership; between 1968 and 1973, he helmed a new incarnation of the Byrds that featured guitarist Clarence White, among others. McGuinn disbanded that iteration of the band in early 1973 to make way for a reunion of the original quintet. The Byrds&#x27; final album was released in March 1973, with the reunited group disbanding later that year.

Several former members of the Byrds went on to successful careers of their own, either as solo artists or as members of such groups as Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, the Flying Burrito Brothers, McGuinn, Clark &amp; Hillman, and the Desert Rose Band. In 1991, the Byrds were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, an occasion that saw the five original members performing together for the last time. Gene Clark died of a heart attack later that year, while Michael Clarke died of liver failure in 1993. Crosby died in 2023. McGuinn and Hillman remain musically active.

==History==

===Formation (1964)===
The nucleus of the Byrds formed in early 1964, when Jim McGuinn, Gene Clark, and David Crosby came together as a trio. All three musicians had a background rooted in folk music, with each one having worked as a folk singer on the acoustic coffeehouse circuit during the early 1960s. In addition, they had all served time—independently of each other—as sidemen in various &quot;collegiate folk&quot; groups: McGuinn with the Limeliters and the Chad Mitchell Trio, Clark with the New Christy Minstrels, and Crosby with Les Baxter&#x27;s Balladeers. McGuinn had also spent time as a professional songwriter at the Brill Building in New York City, under the tutelage of Bobby Darin. By early 1964, McGuinn had become enamored with the music of the Beatles, and had begun to intersperse his solo folk repertoire with acoustic versions of Beatles&#x27; songs. While performing at the Troubadour folk club in Los Angeles, McGuinn was approached by fellow Beatles fan Gene Clark, and the pair soon formed a Peter and Gordon-style duo, playing Beatles&#x27; covers, Beatlesque renditions of traditional folk songs, and some self-penned material. Soon after, David Crosby introduced himself to the duo at The Troubadour and began harmonizing with them on some of their songs. Impressed by the blend of their voices, the three musicians formed a trio and named themselves the Jet Set, a moniker inspired by McGuinn&#x27;s love of aeronautics.

Crosby introduced McGuinn and Clark to his associate Jim Dickson, who had access to World Pacific Studios, where he had been recording demos of Crosby. Sensing the trio&#x27;s potential, Dickson quickly took on management duties for the group, while his business partner, Eddie Tickner, became the group&#x27;s accountant and financial manager. Dickson began utilizing World Pacific Studios to record the trio as they honed their craft and perfected their blend of Beatles pop and Bob Dylan-style folk. It was during the rehearsals at World Pacific that the band&#x27;s folk rock sound—an amalgam of their own Beatles-influenced material, their folk music roots and their Beatlesque covers of contemporary folk songs—began to coalesce. Initially, this blend arose organically, but as rehearsals continued, the band began to actively attempt to bridge the gap between folk music and rock. Demo recordings made by the Jet Set at World Pacific Studios were later collected on the compilation albums &quot;Preflyte&quot;, &quot;In the Beginning&quot;, &quot;The Preflyte Sessions,&quot; and &quot;Preflyte Plus&quot;.

Drummer Michael Clarke joined the Jet Set in mid-1964. Clarke was recruited largely due to his good looks and Brian Jones-esque hairstyle, rather than for his musical experience, which was limited to having played congas in a semi-professional capacity in and around San Francisco and L.A. Clarke did not even own his own drum kit and initially had to play on a makeshift setup consisting of cardboard boxes and a tambourine. As the band continued to rehearse, Dickson arranged a one-off single deal for the group with Elektra Records&#x27; founder Jac Holzman. The single, which coupled the band originals &quot;Please Let Me Love You&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Long&quot;, featured McGuinn, Clark, and Crosby, augmented by session musicians Ray Pohlman on bass and Earl Palmer on drums. In an attempt to cash in on the British Invasion craze that was dominating the American charts at the time, the band&#x27;s name was changed for the single release to the suitably British-sounding the Beefeaters. &quot;Please Let Me Love You&quot; was issued by Elektra Records on October 7, 1964, but it failed to chart.
In August 1964, Dickson managed to acquire an acetate disc of the then-unreleased Bob Dylan song &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, which he felt would make an effective cover for the Jet Set. Although the band was initially unimpressed with the song, they began rehearsing it with a rock band arrangement, changing the time signature from  to a rockier  configuration in the process. In an attempt to bolster the group&#x27;s confidence in the song, Dickson invited Dylan himself to World Pacific to hear the band perform &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;. Impressed by the group&#x27;s rendition, Dylan enthusiastically commented, &quot;Wow, man! You can dance to that!&quot; His ringing endorsement erased any lingering doubts that the band had over the song&#x27;s suitability.

Soon after, inspired by the Beatles&#x27; film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, the band decided to equip themselves with similar instruments to the Fab Four: a Rickenbacker twelve-string guitar for McGuinn, a Ludwig drum kit for Clarke, and a Gretsch Tennessean guitar for Clark (although Crosby commandeered it soon after, resulting in Clark switching to tambourine). In October 1964, Dickson recruited mandolin player Chris Hillman as the Jet Set&#x27;s bassist. Hillman&#x27;s background was more oriented towards country music than folk or rock, having been a member of the bluegrass groups the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers, the Hillmen (also known as the Golden State Boys), and, concurrently with his recruitment into the Jet Set, the Green Grass Group.

Through connections that Dickson had with impresario Benny Shapiro, and with a helpful recommendation from jazz trumpeter Miles Davis, the group signed a recording contract with Columbia Records on November 10, 1964. Two weeks later, during a Thanksgiving dinner at Tickner&#x27;s house, the Jet Set decided to rename themselves as the Byrds, a moniker that retained the theme of flight and also echoed the deliberate misspelling of the Beatles.

===Folk rock (1965)===
On January 20, 1965, the Byrds entered Columbia Studios in Hollywood to record &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; for release as their debut single on Columbia. Since the band had not yet completely gelled musically, McGuinn was the only Byrd to play on &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; and its Clark-penned B-side, &quot;I Knew I&#x27;d Want You&quot;. Rather than using band members, producer Terry Melcher hired a collection of top session musicians, retroactively known as the Wrecking Crew, including Hal Blaine (drums), Larry Knechtel (bass), Jerry Cole (guitar), Bill Pitman (guitar), and Leon Russell (electric piano), who (along with McGuinn on guitar) provided the instrumental backing track over which McGuinn, Crosby and Clark sang. By the time the sessions for their debut album began in March 1965, Melcher was satisfied that the band was competent enough to record its own musical backing. The use of outside musicians on the Byrds&#x27; debut single has given rise to the persistent misconception that all of the playing on their debut album was done by session musicians.

While the band waited for &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; to be released, they began a residency at Ciro&#x27;s Le Disc nightclub on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood. The band&#x27;s regular appearances at Ciro&#x27;s during March and April 1965 allowed them to hone their ensemble playing, perfect their aloof stage persona, and expand their repertoire. It was during their residency at the nightclub that the band first began to accrue a dedicated following among L.A.&#x27;s youth culture and hip Hollywood fraternity, with scenesters like Kim Fowley, Peter Fonda, Jack Nicholson, Arthur Lee, and Sonny &amp; Cher regularly attending the band&#x27;s performances. On March 26, 1965, the author of the band&#x27;s forthcoming debut single, Bob Dylan, made an impromptu visit to the club and joined the Byrds on stage for a rendition of Jimmy Reed&#x27;s &quot;Baby What You Want Me to Do&quot;. The excitement generated by the Byrds at Ciro&#x27;s quickly made them a must-see fixture on L.A.&#x27;s nightclub scene and resulted in hordes of teenagers filling the sidewalks outside the club, desperate to see the band perform. A number of noted music historians and authors, including Richie Unterberger, Ric Menck, and Peter Buckley, have suggested that the crowds of young Bohemians and hipsters that gathered at Ciro&#x27;s to see the Byrds perform represented the first stirrings of the West Coast hippie counterculture.

Columbia Records eventually released the &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; single on April 12, 1965. The full, electric rock band treatment that the Byrds and producer Terry Melcher had given the song effectively created the template for the musical subgenre of folk rock. McGuinn&#x27;s melodic, jangling 12-string Rickenbacker guitar playing—which was heavily compressed to produce an extremely bright and sustained tone—was immediately influential and has remained so to the present day. The single also featured another major characteristic of the band&#x27;s sound: their clear harmony singing, which usually featured McGuinn and Clark in unison, with Crosby providing the high harmony. Richie Unterberger has stated that the song&#x27;s abstract lyrics took rock and pop songwriting to new heights; never before had such intellectual and literary wordplay been combined with rock instrumentation by a popular music group.

Within three months &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; had become the first folk rock smash hit, reaching number one on both the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart. The single&#x27;s success initiated the folk rock boom of 1965 and 1966, during which a number of Byrds-influenced acts had hits on the American and British charts. The term &quot;folk rock&quot; was itself coined by the American music press to describe the band&#x27;s sound in June 1965, at roughly the same time as &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; peaked at number 1 in the U.S.
The &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; album followed on June 21, 1965, peaking at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart and number seven on the UK Albums Chart. The album mixed reworkings of folk songs, including Pete Seeger&#x27;s musical adaptation of the Idris Davies&#x27; poem &quot;The Bells of Rhymney&quot;, with a number of other Dylan covers and the band&#x27;s own compositions, the majority of which were written by Clark. In particular, Clark&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Feel a Whole Lot Better&quot; has gone on to become a rock music standard, with many critics considering it one of the band&#x27;s and Clark&#x27;s best songs. Upon release, the &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; album, like the single of the same name, was influential in popularizing folk rock and served to establish the band as an internationally successful rock act, representing the first effective American challenge to the dominance of the Beatles and the British Invasion.
The Byrds&#x27; next single was &quot;All I Really Want to Do&quot;, another interpretation of a Dylan song. Despite the success of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, the Byrds were reluctant to release another Dylan-penned single, feeling that it was too formulaic, but Columbia Records were insistent, believing that another Dylan cover would result in an instant hit for the group. The Byrds&#x27; rendition of &quot;All I Really Want to Do&quot; is noticeably different in structure to Dylan&#x27;s original: it features an ascending melody progression in the chorus and utilizes a completely new melody for one of the song&#x27;s verses, to turn it into a Beatlesque, minor-key bridge. Issued on June 14, 1965, while &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; was still climbing the U.S. charts, the single was rush-released by Columbia in an attempt to bury a rival cover version that Cher had released simultaneously on Imperial Records. A chart battle ensued, but the Byrds&#x27; rendition stalled at number 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while Cher&#x27;s version reached number 15. The reverse was true in the UK, where the Byrds&#x27; version reached number four, while Cher&#x27;s peaked at number nine.

Author John Einarson has written that during this period of their career, the Byrds enjoyed tremendous popularity among teenage pop fans, with their music receiving widespread airplay on Top 40 radio and their faces adorning countless teen magazines. Much was made at the time of the Byrds&#x27; unconventional dress sense, with their casual attire strikingly at odds with the prevailing trend for uniformity among contemporary beat groups. With all five members sporting Beatlesque moptop haircuts, Crosby dressed in a striking green suede cape, and McGuinn wearing a pair of distinctive rectangular &quot;granny glasses&quot;, the band exuded California cool, while also looking suitably non-conformist. In particular, McGuinn&#x27;s distinctive rectangular spectacles became popular among members of the burgeoning hippie counterculture in the United States.

Although McGuinn was widely regarded as the Byrds&#x27; bandleader by this point, the band actually had multiple frontmen, with McGuinn, Clark, and later Crosby and Hillman all singing lead vocals in roughly equal measures across the group&#x27;s repertoire. Despite the dizzying array of personnel changes that the group underwent in later years, this lack of a dedicated lead singer remained a stylistic trait of the Byrds&#x27; music throughout the majority of the band&#x27;s existence. A further distinctive aspect of the Byrds&#x27; image was their unsmiling air of detachment, both on stage and in front of the camera. This natural aloofness was compounded by the large amounts of marijuana that the band smoked and often resulted in moody and erratic live performances. The contemporary music press was extremely critical of the Byrds&#x27; abilities as a live act during the mid-1960s, with the reception from the British media during the band&#x27;s August 1965 tour of England being particularly scathing.

This 1965 English tour was largely orchestrated by the group&#x27;s publicist Derek Taylor, in an attempt to capitalize on the number 1 chart success of the &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; single. The tour was overhyped from the start, with the band being touted as &quot;America&#x27;s answer to the Beatles&quot;, a label that proved impossible for the Byrds to live up to. During concert performances, a combination of poor sound, group illness, ragged musicianship, and the band&#x27;s notoriously lackluster stage presence all combined to alienate audiences and served to provoke a merciless castigating of the band in the British press.

The tour enabled the band to meet and socialize with a number of top English groups, including the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. In particular, the band&#x27;s relationship with the Beatles would prove important for both acts, with the two groups again meeting in Los Angeles some weeks later, upon the Byrds&#x27; return to America. During this period of fraternization, the Beatles were vocal in their support of the Byrds, publicly acknowledging them as creative competitors and naming them as their favorite American group. A number of authors, including Ian MacDonald, Richie Unterberger, and Bud Scoppa, have commented on the Byrds influence on the Beatles&#x27; late 1965 album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, most notably on the songs &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; and &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;, the latter of which utilizes a guitar riff similar to that in the Byrds&#x27; cover of &quot;The Bells of Rhymney&quot;.
For their third Columbia single, the Byrds initially intended to release a cover of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot; (it was even premiered on the California radio station KRLA), but instead they decided to record &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn! (to Everything There Is a Season)&quot;, a Pete Seeger composition with lyrics adapted almost entirely from the biblical Book of Ecclesiastes. The song was brought to the group by McGuinn, who had previously arranged it in a chamber-folk style while working on folk singer Judy Collins&#x27; 1963 album, &quot;Judy Collins 3&quot;. The Byrds&#x27; cover of &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn! (to Everything There Is a Season)&quot; was issued on October 1, 1965 and became the band&#x27;s second U.S. number 1 single, as well as the title track for their second album. The single represented the high-water mark of folk rock as a chart trend and has been described by music historian Richie Unterberger as &quot;folk rock&#x27;s highest possible grace note&quot;. Music critic William Ruhlmann has written that the song&#x27;s lyrical message of peace and tolerance struck a nerve with the American record buying public as the Vietnam War continued to escalate.
The Byrds&#x27; second album, &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot;, was released in December 1965 and while it received a mostly positive reception, critical consensus deemed it to be inferior to the band&#x27;s debut. Irrespective of the critics&#x27; opinions, the album was a commercial success, peaking at number 17 on the U.S. charts and number 11 in the UK. Author Scott Schinder has stated that &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot;, along with &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, served to establish the Byrds as one of rock music&#x27;s most important creative forces, on a par with the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones. Like their debut, the album comprised a mixture of group originals, folk songs, and Bob Dylan covers, all characterized by the group&#x27;s clear harmonies and McGuinn&#x27;s distinctive guitar sound. The album featured more of the band&#x27;s own compositions than its predecessor, with Clark in particular coming to the fore as a songwriter. His songs from this period, including &quot;She Don&#x27;t Care About Time&quot;, &quot;The World Turns All Around Her&quot;, and &quot;Set You Free This Time&quot;, are widely regarded by critics as among the best of the folk rock genre. The latter song was even chosen for release as a single in January 1966, but its densely worded lyrics, melancholy melody, and ballad-like tempo contributed to it stalling at number 63 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and failing to reach the UK chart altogether.

While the Byrds outwardly seemed to be riding the crest of a wave during the latter half of 1965, the recording sessions for their second album had not been without tension. One source of conflict was the power struggle that had begun to develop between producer Melcher and the band&#x27;s manager, Jim Dickson, with the latter harboring aspirations to produce the band himself, causing him to be overly critical of the former&#x27;s work. Within a month of &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot; being released, Dickson and the Byrds approached Columbia Records and requested that Melcher be replaced, despite the fact that he had successfully steered the band through the recording of two number 1 singles and two hit albums. Any hopes that Dickson had of being allowed to produce the band himself were dashed when Columbia assigned their West Coast head of A&amp;R, Allen Stanton, to the band.

===Psychedelia (1965–1967)===
On December 22, 1965, the Byrds recorded a new, self-penned composition titled &quot;Eight Miles High&quot; at RCA Studios in Hollywood. Columbia Records refused to release this version because it had been recorded at another record company&#x27;s facility. As a result, the band was forced to re-record the song at Columbia Studios in Los Angeles on January 24 and 25, 1966. This re-recorded version was released as a single and included on the group&#x27;s third album. The song represented a creative leap forward for the band and is often considered the first full-blown psychedelic rock recording by critics, although other contemporaneous acts, such as Donovan and the Yardbirds, were also exploring similar musical territory. It was also pivotal in transmuting folk rock into the new musical forms of psychedelia and raga rock.

&quot;Eight Miles High&quot; is marked by McGuinn&#x27;s groundbreaking lead guitar playing, which saw the guitarist attempting to emulate the free form jazz saxophone playing of John Coltrane, and in particular, Coltrane&#x27;s playing on the song &quot;India&quot; from his &quot;Impressions&quot; album. It also exhibits the influence of the Indian classical music of Ravi Shankar in the droning quality of the song&#x27;s vocal melody and in McGuinn&#x27;s guitar playing. The song&#x27;s subtle use of Indian influences resulted in it being labeled as &quot;raga rock&quot; by the music press, but in fact, it was the single&#x27;s B-side, &quot;Why&quot;, that drew more directly on Indian ragas.

Upon release, &quot;Eight Miles High&quot; was banned by many U.S. radio stations, following allegations made by the broadcasting trade journal the &quot;Gavin Report&quot;, that its lyrics advocated recreational drug use. The band and their management strenuously denied these allegations, stating that the song&#x27;s lyrics actually described an airplane flight to London and the band&#x27;s subsequent concert tour of England. The relatively modest chart success of &quot;Eight Miles High&quot; (number 14 in the U.S. and number 24 in the UK) has been largely attributed to the broadcasting ban, although the challenging and slightly uncommercial nature of the track is another possible reason for its failure to reach the Top 10.

In February 1966, just prior to the release of &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;, Gene Clark left the band. His departure was partly due to his fear of flying, which made it impossible for him to keep up with the Byrds&#x27; itinerary, and partly due to his increasing isolation within the band. Clark, who had witnessed a fatal airplane crash as a youth, had a panic attack on a plane bound for New York and as a result, he disembarked and refused to take the flight. In effect, Clark&#x27;s exit from the plane represented his exit from the Byrds, with McGuinn telling him, &quot;If you can&#x27;t fly, you can&#x27;t be a Byrd.&quot; It has become known in the years since the incident that there were other stress and anxiety-related factors at work, as well as resentment within the band that Gene&#x27;s songwriting income had made him the wealthiest member of the group. Clark was subsequently signed by Columbia Records as a solo artist and went on to produce a critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful body of work. He died on May 24, 1991, at the age of 46, from heart failure brought on by a bleeding stomach ulcer, although years of alcohol abuse and heavy cigarette smoking were also contributing factors.

The Byrds&#x27; third album, &quot;Fifth Dimension&quot;, was released in July 1966. Much of the album&#x27;s material continued to build on the band&#x27;s new psychedelic sound, with McGuinn extending his exploration of jazz and raga styles on tracks such as &quot;I See You&quot; and the Crosby-penned &quot;What&#x27;s Happening?!?!&quot;. The album also saw Hillman coming forward as the band&#x27;s third vocalist, in order to fill the hole in the group&#x27;s harmonies that Clark&#x27;s departure had left. The title track, &quot;5D (Fifth Dimension)&quot;, was released as a single ahead of the album and was, like &quot;Eight Miles High&quot; before it, banned by a number of U.S. radio stations for supposedly featuring lyrics that advocated drug use. The album&#x27;s front cover artwork featured the first appearance of the Byrds&#x27; colorful, psychedelic mosaic logo, variations of which would subsequently appear on a number of the band&#x27;s compilation albums, as well as on their 1967 release, &quot;Younger Than Yesterday&quot;.

The &quot;Fifth Dimension&quot; album received a mixed critical reception upon release and was less commercially successful than its predecessors, peaking at number 24 in the U.S. and number 27 in the UK. Band biographer Bud Scoppa has remarked that with the album&#x27;s lackluster chart performance, its lukewarm critical reception, and the high-profile loss of Clark from the group, the Byrds&#x27; popularity began to wane at this point and by late 1966, the group had been all but forgotten by the mainstream pop audience. Despite this, the band were considered forefathers of the emerging rock underground, with many of the new L.A. and San Francisco groups of the day, including Love, Jefferson Airplane, and Buffalo Springfield, publicly naming the Byrds as a primary influence.
The band returned to the studio between November 28 and December 8, 1966, to record their fourth album, &quot;Younger Than Yesterday&quot;. With Allen Stanton having recently departed Columbia Records to work for A&amp;M, the band chose to bring in producer Gary Usher to help guide them through the album sessions. Usher, who had a wealth of production experience and a love of innovative studio experimentation, would prove invaluable to the Byrds as they entered their most creatively adventurous phase. The first song to be recorded for the album was the McGuinn and Hillman-penned &quot;So You Want to Be a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Star&quot;, a satirical and heavily sarcastic jibe at the manufactured nature of groups like the Monkees. The song features the trumpet playing of South African musician Hugh Masekela and as such, marks the first appearance of brass on a Byrds&#x27; recording. &quot;So You Want to Be a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Star&quot; was issued as a single in January 1967 and peaked at number 29 in America but failed to chart in the UK. Despite this relatively poor chart showing, &quot;So You Want to Be a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Star&quot; has become one of the Byrds&#x27; best-known songs in the years since its initial release, inspiring cover versions by the likes of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and the Patti Smith Group amongst others.
Released on February 6, 1967, the Byrds&#x27; fourth album, &quot;Younger Than Yesterday&quot;, was more varied than its predecessor and saw the band successfully mixing psychedelia with folk rock and country and western influences. Although it received generally positive reviews upon its release, the album was, to a degree, overlooked by the record-buying public and consequently peaked at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and number 37 on the UK Albums Chart. Music expert Peter Buckley has pointed out that although the album may have passed the Byrds&#x27; rapidly shrinking teen audience by, it found favor with &quot;a new underground following who disdained hit singles, but were coming to regard albums as major artistic statements&quot;.

In addition to &quot;So You Want to Be a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Star&quot;, &quot;Younger Than Yesterday&quot; also includes the evocative Crosby and McGuinn penned song &quot;Renaissance Fair&quot;, a cover of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;My Back Pages&quot; (which was later released as a single), and a quartet of Chris Hillman songs, which found the bassist emerging fully formed as an accomplished songwriter. Two of Hillman&#x27;s country-oriented compositions on the album, &quot;Time Between&quot; and &quot;The Girl with No Name&quot;, can be seen as early indicators of the country rock direction that the band would pursue on later albums. &quot;Younger Than Yesterday&quot; also features the jazz-tinged Crosby ballad &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Been Burned&quot;, which critic Thomas Ward has described as &quot;one of the most haunting songs in the Byrds&#x27; catalogue, and one of David Crosby&#x27;s finest compositions&quot;.

By mid-1967, McGuinn had changed his first name from Jim to Roger as a result of his interest in the Indonesian religion Subud, into which he had been initiated in January 1965. The adoption of a new name was common among followers of the religion and served to signify a spiritual rebirth for the participant. Shortly after McGuinn&#x27;s name change, the band entered the studio to record the Crosby-penned, non-album single &quot;Lady Friend&quot;, which was released on July 13, 1967. The Byrds&#x27; biographer Johnny Rogan has described &quot;Lady Friend&quot; as &quot;a work of great maturity&quot; and &quot;the loudest, fastest and rockiest Byrds&#x27; single to date&quot;. Regardless of its artistic merits, the single stalled at a disappointing number 82 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, despite the band making a number of high-profile television appearances to promote the record. Crosby, who had closely overseen the recording of the song, was bitterly disappointed by the single&#x27;s lack of success and blamed Gary Usher&#x27;s mixing of the song as a factor in its commercial failure.

The poor sales suffered by &quot;Lady Friend&quot; were in stark contrast to the chart success of the band&#x27;s first compilation album, &quot;The Byrds&#x27; Greatest Hits&quot;, which was released on August 7, 1967. Sanctioned by Columbia Records in the wake of the Top 10 success of &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, the album was a critical and commercial triumph, peaking at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart and giving the band their highest-charting album in America since their 1965 debut, &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;. Within a year, the compilation was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, and eventually went platinum on November 21, 1986, and is today the biggest-selling album in the Byrds&#x27; discography.

Prior to the release of &quot;The Byrds&#x27; Greatest Hits&quot;, the band decided to dispense with the services of their co-managers Jim Dickson and Eddie Tickner. The relationship between Dickson and the band had soured over recent months, and he and Tickner&#x27;s business arrangement with the Byrds was officially dissolved on June 30, 1967. At Crosby&#x27;s recommendation, Larry Spector was brought in to handle the Byrds&#x27; business affairs, with the group electing to manage themselves to a large extent.
Between June and December 1967, the Byrds worked on completing their fifth album, &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot;. The lead single from the album was a cover of the Gerry Goffin and Carole King song &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot;, which was released in October 1967 and peaked at number 89 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. Despite this lack of commercial success, the Byrds&#x27; rendition of &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot; featured a band performance that author Ric Menck has described as &quot;a beautiful recording&quot;, while music critic Richie Unterberger has called it &quot;a magnificent and melodic cover ... that should have been a big hit&quot;. The song found the Byrds successfully blending their signature harmonies and chiming 12-string guitar playing with the sound of the pedal steel guitar for the first time, foreshadowing their extensive use of the instrument on their next album, &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;.

Released in January 1968, &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot; saw the band taking their psychedelic experimentation to its furthest extremes by mixing folk rock, country music, jazz, and psychedelia (often within a single song), while utilizing innovative studio production techniques such as phasing and flanging. The album featured contributions from a number of noted session musicians, including bluegrass guitarist and future Byrd, Clarence White. White, who had also played on &quot;Younger Than Yesterday&quot;, contributed country-influenced guitar to the tracks &quot;Natural Harmony&quot;, &quot;Wasn&#x27;t Born to Follow&quot;, and &quot;Change Is Now&quot;. Upon release, the album was almost universally praised by music critics but it was only moderately successful commercially, particularly in the United States where it peaked at number 47. The album&#x27;s reputation has grown over the years and has become widely regarded by critics and fans as one of the Byrds&#x27; best albums.

===Lineup changes (1967–1968)===
While the band worked on &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot; album throughout late 1967, there was increasing tension and acrimony among the members of the group, which eventually resulted in the dismissals of Crosby and Clarke. McGuinn and Hillman became increasingly irritated by what they saw as Crosby&#x27;s overbearing egotism and his attempts to dictate the band&#x27;s musical direction. In addition, during the Byrds&#x27; performance at the Monterey Pop Festival on June 17, 1967, Crosby gave lengthy in-between-song speeches on controversial subjects, including the JFK assassination and the benefits of giving LSD to &quot;all the statesmen and politicians in the world&quot;, to the intense annoyance of the other band members. He further irritated his bandmates by performing with rival group Buffalo Springfield at Monterey, filling in for ex-member Neil Young. His reputation within the band deteriorated even more following the commercial failure of &quot;Lady Friend&quot;, the first Byrds&#x27; single to feature a song penned solely by Crosby on its A-side.

Tensions within the band finally erupted in August 1967, during recording sessions for &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot; album, when Michael Clarke quit the sessions over disputes with his bandmates and his dissatisfaction with the material that the songwriting members of the band were providing. Session drummers Jim Gordon and Hal Blaine were brought in to replace Clarke temporarily in the studio, although he continued to honor his live concert commitments with the group. Then, in September, Crosby refused to participate in the recording of the Goffin–King song &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot;, considering it to be inferior to his own &quot;Triad&quot;, a controversial song about a ménage à trois that was in direct competition with &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot; for a place on the album. Crosby felt that the band should rely on self-penned material for their albums, rather than cover songs by other artists and writers. He would eventually give &quot;Triad&quot; to the San Francisco band Jefferson Airplane, who included a recording of it on their 1968 album, &quot;Crown of Creation&quot;.

When tensions reached a breaking point during October 1967, McGuinn and Hillman drove to Crosby&#x27;s home and fired him, stating that they would be better off without him. Crosby subsequently received a cash settlement, with which he bought a sailboat and soon after, he began working with Stephen Stills and Graham Nash in the successful supergroup Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash. In the years after his exit from the Byrds, Crosby enjoyed an influential and commercially successful career as a part of Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash (sometimes augmented by Neil Young), Crosby &amp; Nash, CPR, and as a solo artist. During the 1980s, he fought against crippling drug addiction and eventually served a year in prison on drug-related charges. He emerged from jail free of his drug habit and remained musically active up to his death in 2023.

Following Crosby&#x27;s departure, Gene Clark briefly rejoined the band, but left just three weeks later, after again refusing to board an aircraft while on tour. There is some disagreement among biographers and band historians as to whether Clark actually participated in the recording sessions for &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot;, but there is evidence to suggest that he sang backing vocals on the songs &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot; and &quot;Space Odyssey&quot;. Michael Clarke also returned to the recording studio briefly, towards the end of the album sessions, before being informed by McGuinn and Hillman that they were dismissing him from the band.

Now reduced to a duo, McGuinn and Hillman elected to hire new band members. Hillman&#x27;s cousin Kevin Kelley was quickly recruited as the band&#x27;s new drummer and the trio embarked on an early 1968 college tour in support of &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot;. It soon became apparent that recreating the band&#x27;s studio recordings with a three-piece line-up wasn&#x27;t going to be possible and so, McGuinn and Hillman, in a fateful decision for their future career direction, hired Gram Parsons as a keyboard player, although he quickly moved to guitar. Although Parsons and Kelley were both considered full members of the Byrds, they actually received a salary from McGuinn and Hillman, and did not sign with Columbia Records when the Byrds&#x27; recording contract was renewed on February 29, 1968.

===Country rock (1968–1973)===

====Gram Parsons era====
Following his induction into the band, Gram Parsons began to assert his own musical agenda in which he intended to marry his love of country and western music with youth culture&#x27;s passion for rock and, in doing so, make country music fashionable for a young audience. He found a kindred spirit in Hillman, who had played mandolin in a number of notable bluegrass bands before joining the Byrds. In addition, Hillman had also persuaded the Byrds to incorporate subtle country influences into their music in the past, beginning with the song &quot;Satisfied Mind&quot; on the &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot; album. Although McGuinn had some reservations about the band&#x27;s proposed new direction, Parsons convinced him that a move towards country music could theoretically expand the group&#x27;s declining audience. Thus, McGuinn was persuaded to change direction and abandon his original concept for the group&#x27;s next album, which had been to record a history of 20th century American popular music, and instead explore country rock.

On March 9, 1968, the band decamped to Columbia&#x27;s recording studios in Nashville, Tennessee, with Clarence White in tow, to begin the recording sessions for the &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; album. While in Nashville, the Byrds also appeared at the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; on March 15, 1968, where they performed the Merle Haggard song &quot;Sing Me Back Home&quot; and Parsons&#x27; own &quot;Hickory Wind&quot; (although they were actually scheduled to play a second Haggard song, &quot;Life in Prison&quot;). Being the first group of hippie &quot;longhairs&quot; ever to play at the venerable country music institution, the band was met with heckling, booing, and mocking calls of &quot;tweet, tweet&quot; from the conservative &quot;Opry&quot; audience.

The band also incurred the wrath of renowned country music DJ Ralph Emery, when they appeared on his Nashville-based WSM radio program. Emery mocked the band throughout their interview and made no secret of his dislike for their newly recorded country rock single, &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Goin&#x27; Nowhere&quot;. Parsons and McGuinn would later write the pointedly sarcastic song &quot;Drug Store Truck Drivin&#x27; Man&quot; about Emery and their appearance on his show. Journalist David Fricke has described the reactions of Emery and the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; audience as indicative of the resistance and hostility that the Byrds&#x27; venture into country music provoked from the Nashville old guard.

Following their stay in Nashville, the band returned to Los Angeles and throughout April and May 1968, they worked on completing their new country-oriented album. During this period, Parsons attempted to exert a controlling influence over the group by pressuring McGuinn to recruit either JayDee Maness or Sneaky Pete Kleinow as the band&#x27;s permanent pedal steel guitar player. When McGuinn refused, Parsons next began to push for a higher salary, while also demanding that the group be billed as &quot;Gram Parsons and the Byrds&quot; on their forthcoming album. Even Hillman, who had previously been Parsons&#x27; biggest supporter in the band, began to grow weary of his forceful demands. Ultimately, Parsons&#x27; behavior led to a power struggle for control of the group, with McGuinn finding his position as band leader challenged. Biographer Johnny Rogan has pointed out that the April 1968 release of &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Goin&#x27; Nowhere&quot; served to strengthen McGuinn&#x27;s position as head Byrd, with the guitarist&#x27;s familiar drawl occupying the lead vocal spot and negligible input from Parsons, despite the single&#x27;s obvious country leanings.

Parsons&#x27; dominance over the band waned still further during post-production for &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;, when his appearance on the album was contested by music business impresario Lee Hazlewood, who alleged that the singer was still under contract to his LHI record label, creating legal complications for Columbia Records. As a result of this, McGuinn and Hillman replaced Parsons&#x27; lead vocals on the songs &quot;You Don&#x27;t Miss Your Water&quot;, &quot;The Christian Life&quot;, and &quot;One Hundred Years from Now&quot; before the legal problems could be resolved. Album producer Gary Usher would later put a different slant on the events surrounding the removal of Parsons&#x27; vocals by telling his biographer Stephen J. McParland that the alterations to the album arose out of creative concerns, not legal ones; Usher and the band were both worried that Parsons&#x27; contributions were dominating the record so his vocals were excised in an attempt to increase McGuinn and Hillman&#x27;s presence on the album. In the album&#x27;s final running order, Parsons is still featured as lead vocalist on the songs &quot;You&#x27;re Still on My Mind&quot;, &quot;Life in Prison&quot;, and &quot;Hickory Wind&quot;.

With their new album now completed, the Byrds flew to England for an appearance at a charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall on July 7, 1968. Following the concert, just prior to a tour of South Africa, Parsons quit the Byrds on the grounds that he did not want to perform in a racially segregated country (apartheid did not end in South Africa until 1994). Hillman doubted the sincerity of Parsons&#x27; gesture, believing that the singer had in fact left the band in order to remain in England with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, whom he had recently befriended. Parsons stayed at Richards&#x27; house in West Sussex immediately after leaving the Byrds, and the pair developed a close friendship over the next few years. After leaving the Byrds, Parsons produced an influential but commercially unsuccessful body of work, both as a solo artist and with the band the Flying Burrito Brothers (which also featured Hillman). He died on September 19, 1973, at the age of 26, following an accidental overdose of morphine and alcohol in his room at the Joshua Tree Inn.

With Parsons gone from the band and their tour of South Africa due to begin in two days time, the Byrds were forced to draft in their roadie Carlos Bernal as a substitute rhythm guitar player. The ensuing South African tour was a disaster, with the band finding themselves having to play to segregated audiences—something that they had been assured by promoters they would not have to do. The under-rehearsed band gave ramshackle performances to audiences that were largely unimpressed with their lack of professionalism and their antagonistic, anti-apartheid stance. The Byrds left South Africa amid a storm of bad publicity and death threats, while the liberal press in the U.S. and the UK attacked the band for undertaking the tour and questioned their political integrity. McGuinn attempted to counter this criticism by asserting that the tour of South Africa had, in some small way, been an attempt to challenge the country&#x27;s political status quo and protest against apartheid.
After returning to California, the Byrds&#x27; released the &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; album on August 30, 1968, almost eight weeks after Parsons had left the band. It comprised a mixture of country music standards and contemporary country material, along with a country reworking of William Bell&#x27;s soul hit &quot;You Don&#x27;t Miss Your Water&quot;. The album also included the Parsons originals &quot;Hickory Wind&quot; and &quot;One Hundred Years from Now&quot;, along with the Bob Dylan-penned songs &quot;Nothing Was Delivered&quot; and &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Goin&#x27; Nowhere&quot;, the latter of which had been a moderately successful single. Although it was not the first country rock album, &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; was the first album widely labeled as country rock to be released by an internationally successful rock act, pre-dating Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; by over six months.

The stylistic shift away from psychedelia towards country rock that &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; represented alienated much of the Byrds&#x27; countercultural audience, while at the same time eliciting hostility from the ultra-conservative Nashville country music establishment. As a result, the album peaked at number 77 on the U.S. charts and was the least commercially successful Byrds&#x27; album to date upon its initial release. Today, it is considered a seminal and highly influential album, serving as a blueprint for the entire 1970s country rock movement, the outlaw country scene, and the alternative country genre of the 1990s and early 21st century.

====Clarence White era====
After Gram Parsons&#x27; departure, McGuinn and Hillman decided to recruit noted session guitarist Clarence White as a full-time member of the band in late July 1968. White, who had contributed countrified guitar playing to every Byrds&#x27; album since 1967&#x27;s &quot;Younger Than Yesterday&quot;, was brought in at Hillman&#x27;s suggestion as someone who could handle the band&#x27;s older rock repertoire and their newer country-oriented material. Shortly after his induction into the band, White began to express dissatisfaction with drummer Kevin Kelley and soon persuaded McGuinn and Hillman to replace him with Gene Parsons (no relation to Gram), who White had previously played with in the country rock band Nashville West.

The McGuinn–Hillman–White–Parsons line-up was together for less than a month before Hillman quit to join Gram Parsons in forming the Flying Burrito Brothers. Hillman had become increasingly disenchanted with the Byrds since the South African debacle, and was also frustrated by business manager Larry Spector&#x27;s mishandling of the group&#x27;s finances. Things came to a head on September 15, 1968, following a band performance at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, when Hillman and Spector came to blows backstage. In a fit of rage, Hillman threw down his bass in disgust and walked out of the group. Following his exit, Hillman would have a successful career both as a solo artist and with bands such as the Flying Burrito Brothers, Manassas, the Souther–Hillman–Furay Band, and the Desert Rose Band. He remains active, releasing albums and touring, often with ex-Desert Rose Band member Herb Pedersen.

As the only original band member left, McGuinn elected to hire bassist John York as Hillman&#x27;s replacement. York had previously been a member of the Sir Douglas Quintet and had also worked as a session musician with Johnny Rivers and the Mamas &amp; the Papas. In October 1968, the new line-up entered Columbia Studios in Hollywood to begin recording the &quot;Dr. Byrds &amp; Mr. Hyde&quot; album with producer Bob Johnston. The sessions saw the band juxtaposing their new country rock sound with more psychedelic-oriented material, giving the resulting album a stylistic split personality that was alluded to in its title. In the wake of the recent changes in band personnel, McGuinn decided that it would be too confusing for fans of the group to hear the unfamiliar voices of White, Parsons and York coming forward at this stage, and so they were relegated to backing vocals on the album. As a result, &quot;Dr. Byrds &amp; Mr. Hyde&quot; is unique in the Byrds&#x27; back catalogue as McGuinn sings lead on every track.
The album was released on March 5, 1969 to generally positive reviews, but in America became the lowest-charting album of the Byrds&#x27; career, peaking at number 153 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts. The album fared much better in the UK, where it attracted glowing reviews and reached number 15. A number of tracks on &quot;Dr Byrds &amp; Mr. Hyde&quot;, including the instrumental &quot;Nashville West&quot; and the traditional song &quot;Old Blue&quot;, featured the sound of the Parsons and White designed StringBender (also known as the B-Bender), an invention that allowed White to duplicate the sound of a pedal steel guitar on his Fender Telecaster. The distinctive sound of the StringBender became characteristic of the Byrds&#x27; music during White&#x27;s tenure.

Following the release of &quot;Dr. Byrds &amp; Mr. Hyde&quot; the band issued a version of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Lay Lady Lay&quot; as a single in May 1969, which failed to reverse the group&#x27;s commercial fortunes in the U.S., reaching number 132. The Byrds&#x27; producer Bob Johnston took it upon himself to overdub a female choir onto the record, something the group only became aware of after the single was issued, leaving them incensed by what they saw as an embarrassing and incongruous addition. As a result, the band dispensed with Johnston and re-enlisted Terry Melcher, who had produced the band&#x27;s first two albums, to produce their next LP. Although he was happy to accept the band&#x27;s invitation, Melcher insisted that he also manage the group to avoid a repeat of the conflict he had experienced in 1965 with Jim Dickson.

Prior to the release of the Byrds&#x27; next studio album, however, the band&#x27;s former producer Gary Usher managed to acquire a number of demo recordings from Dickson, dating from the group&#x27;s 1964 rehearsal sessions at World Pacific Studios. These recordings were subsequently issued as the &quot;Preflyte&quot; album on Usher&#x27;s own Together Records imprint in July 1969. Although the material on &quot;Preflyte&quot; was five years old at the time of its release, the album actually managed to outperform &quot;Dr. Byrds &amp; Mr. Hyde&quot; in America, garnering moderately enthusiastic reviews and peaking at number 84 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart.

Between June and August 1969, the Byrds worked with Melcher to complete the &quot;Ballad of Easy Rider&quot; album. Musically, the album represented a consolidation and streamlining the band&#x27;s country rock sound, and mostly consisted of cover versions and traditional material, along with three self-penned originals. The first single to be released from the album was the title track, issued in October 1969 in America and reaching number 65 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Composed primarily by McGuinn, with some input from Bob Dylan (although not credited), &quot;Ballad of Easy Rider&quot; was written as the theme tune for the 1969 counterculture film &quot;Easy Rider&quot;. The Byrds&#x27; recording of the song does not appear in the film and an acoustic version credited to McGuinn alone was used instead. The Byrds&#x27; song &quot;Wasn&#x27;t Born to Follow&quot; from &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot; album was featured in the film and also included on the &quot;Easy Rider&quot; soundtrack album in August 1969. The Byrds&#x27; association with the film heightened their public profile and when the &quot;Ballad of Easy Rider&quot; album was released in November 1969, it peaked at number 36 in the U.S. and number 41 in the UK, becoming the band&#x27;s highest-charting album for two years in America. A second single taken from the album, &quot;Jesus Is Just Alright&quot;, was released in December 1969, but it only managed to reach number 97. Despite this lack of commercial success, the Doobie Brothers&#x27; later hit version of &quot;Jesus Is Just Alright&quot; features an arrangement that was heavily influenced by the Byrds&#x27; recording.
Just prior to the release of &quot;Ballad of Easy Rider&quot;, the Byrds underwent yet another change in personnel when bassist John York was asked to leave the band in September 1969. York had become disenchanted with his role in the Byrds and had voiced his reluctance to perform material that had been written and recorded by the group before he had joined. The rest of the band had begun to doubt his commitment and so, a consensus was reached among the other three members that York should be fired. He was replaced, at the suggestion of Parsons and White, by Skip Battin, a freelance session musician and one-time member of the duo Skip &amp; Flip. Battin&#x27;s recruitment marked the last personnel change to the group for almost three years and as a result, the McGuinn-White-Parsons-Battin line-up became the most stable and longest-lived of any configuration of the Byrds.

The latter-day, post-&quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; version of the band, featuring McGuinn and White&#x27;s dual lead guitar work, toured relentlessly between 1969 and 1972 and was regarded by critics and audiences as much more accomplished in concert than any previous configuration of the Byrds had been. As a result of this, it was decided in early 1970 that the time was right for the group to issue a live album. It was also felt that the band had a sufficient backlog of new compositions to warrant the recording of a new studio album. It was therefore suggested by Melcher that the band should release a double album, featuring one LP of concert recordings and another LP of new studio material. To help with the editing of the live recordings, the band&#x27;s ex-manager Jim Dickson, who had been fired by the group in June 1967, was invited back into the Byrds&#x27; camp. At around this same time, former business manager Eddie Tickner also returned to the group&#x27;s employ as a replacement for Larry Spector, who had quit the management business and relocated to Big Sur.

The two-record &quot;(Untitled)&quot; album was released by the Byrds on September 14, 1970, to positive reviews and strong sales, with many critics and fans regarding the album as a return to form for the band. Peaking at number 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart and number 11 in the UK, the album&#x27;s success continued the upward trend in the band&#x27;s commercial fortunes and popularity that had begun with the release of the &quot;Ballad of Easy Rider&quot; album. The live half of &quot;(Untitled)&quot; included both new material and new renditions of previous hit singles, including &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, &quot;So You Want to Be a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Star&quot; and a 16-minute version of &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;, which comprised the whole of one side of the original LP release. Band biographer Johnny Rogan has suggested that the inclusion of these newly recorded live versions of older songs served to forge a spiritual and musical link between the Byrds&#x27; current line-up and the original mid-1960s incarnation of the band.

The studio recordings featured on &quot;(Untitled)&quot; mostly consisted of newly written, self-penned material, including a number of songs that had been composed by McGuinn and Broadway theatre impresario Jacques Levy for a planned country rock musical titled &quot;Gene Tryp&quot; that the pair were developing. Plans for the musical had fallen through and as a result, McGuinn decided to record some of the material originally intended for the production with the Byrds. Among the &quot;Gene Tryp&quot; songs included on &quot;(Untitled)&quot; was &quot;Chestnut Mare&quot;, which had originally been written for a scene in which the musical&#x27;s eponymous hero attempts to catch and tame a wild horse. The song was issued as a single in the U.S. on October 23, 1970, but it only managed to climb to number 121 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. Despite this low chart placing, the song went on to become a staple of FM radio programming in America during the 1970s. &quot;Chestnut Mare&quot; did much better in the UK, when it was released as a single on January 1, 1971, reaching number 19 on the UK Singles Chart and giving the Byrds their first UK Top 20 hit since their cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;All I Really Want to Do&quot; had peaked at number 4 in September 1965.
The Byrds returned to the recording studio with Melcher sporadically between October 1970 and early March 1971, in order to complete the follow-up to &quot;(Untitled)&quot;, which would be released in June 1971 as &quot;Byrdmaniax&quot;. The grueling pace of the band&#x27;s touring schedule at the time meant that they were not fully prepared for the sessions and much of the material they recorded was under-developed. Following completion of the album recording sessions, the Byrds once again headed out on tour, leaving Melcher and engineer Chris Hinshaw to finish mixing the album in their absence. Controversially, Melcher and Hinshaw elected to bring in arranger Paul Polena to assist in the overdubbing of strings, horns, and a gospel choir onto many of the songs, allegedly without the band&#x27;s consent. Drummer Gene Parsons recalled in a 1997 interview that when the band heard Melcher&#x27;s additions they campaigned to have the album remixed and the orchestration removed, but Columbia Records refused, citing budget restrictions, and so the record was duly pressed up and released.

In May 1971, just prior to the release of the &quot;Byrdmaniax&quot; album, the Byrds undertook a sell-out tour of England and Europe, which included a performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London that was released for the first time in 2008 as &quot;Live at Royal Albert Hall 1971&quot;. The British and European press were unanimous in their praise of the Byrds&#x27; live performances during the tour, reinforcing their reputation as a formidable live act during this period. Over the course of the tour, the band chose to expand their ranks, with roadie Jimmi Seiter joining the group on stage to provide additional percussion as an unofficial member. Seiter would continue to sit in with the Byrds during their live performances until August 1971, when he decided to leave the group&#x27;s employ.

When the &quot;Byrdmaniax&quot; album was released on June 23, 1971 it was received poorly by most critics and did much to undermine the new-found popularity that the Byrds had enjoyed since the release of &quot;Ballad of Easy Rider&quot;. The response to the album from the American music press was particularly scathing, with a review in the August 1971 edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine describing the Byrds as &quot;a boring dead group&quot; and memorably dismissing the entire album as &quot;increments of pus&quot;. The consensus among most reviewers was that &quot;Byrdmaniax&quot; was hampered by Melcher&#x27;s inappropriate orchestration and by being an album almost totally bereft of the Byrds&#x27; signature sound. The band themselves were publicly critical of the album upon its release, with Gene Parsons referring to it as &quot;Melcher&#x27;s folly&quot;. For his part, Melcher later stated that he felt that the band&#x27;s performances in the studio during the making of &quot;Byrdmaniax&quot; were lackluster and he therefore employed the orchestration in order to cover up the album&#x27;s musical shortcomings. By the time of the album&#x27;s release, Melcher had resigned as the Byrds&#x27; manager and producer. Despite the band&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the finished product and its poor critical reception, &quot;Byrdmaniax&quot; made a respectable showing on the U.S. charts, peaking at number 46, but failed to sell in sufficient quantities to reach the UK charts. Author Christopher Hjort has remarked that in the years since its release, &quot;Byrdmaniax&quot; has become arguably &quot;the least-liked album in the Byrds catalogue&quot; among the group&#x27;s fanbase.

The Byrds moved quickly to record a self-produced follow-up to &quot;Byrdmaniax&quot;, in an attempt to stem the criticism that the album was receiving in the music press and as a reaction to their own dislike of Melcher&#x27;s overproduction. Rogan has speculated that the Byrds&#x27; decision to produce their next album themselves was an attempt on the band&#x27;s part to prove that they could do a better job than Melcher had done on their previous record. While in England for an appearance at the Lincoln Folk Festival, the Byrds decamped to CBS Studios in London with engineer Mike Ross and between July 22 and 28, 1971, they recorded an album&#x27;s worth of new material.

In October 1971, CBS Records in the UK issued &quot;The Byrds&#x27; Greatest Hits Volume II&quot; to capitalize on the group&#x27;s recent appearance at the Lincoln Folk Festival and perhaps as a reaction to the chart failure suffered by &quot;Byrdmaniax&quot;. The compilation album also failed to reach the UK charts, while contemporary reviews made note of its misleading and inaccurate title, since among its twelve tracks, only &quot;Chestnut Mare&quot; had been a genuine hit in the United Kingdom. An equivalent compilation wasn&#x27;t released in the U.S. until November 1972, when &quot;The Best of The Byrds: Greatest Hits, Volume II&quot; was issued.

On November 17, 1971, less than five months after the release of &quot;Byrdmaniax&quot;, the Byrds issued their eleventh studio album, &quot;Farther Along&quot;. The album was met with slightly more enthusiastic reviews than its predecessor but only managed to climb to number 152 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart, while failing to reach the charts in the United Kingdom altogether. Musically, the album found the Byrds beginning to move away from their country rock sound—although at least half the album still bore a strong country influence—and instead, embrace a style indebted to 1950s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music. The Skip Battin and Kim Fowley penned song &quot;America&#x27;s Great National Pastime&quot; was taken from the album and released as a single in late November, but it failed to chart on either side of the Atlantic. Rogan has concluded that the rapidity with which the Byrds planned and recorded &quot;Farther Along&quot; resulted in an album that was just as flawed as &quot;Byrdmaniax&quot; and as a result, it failed to rehabilitate the band&#x27;s ailing commercial fortunes or increase their declining audience. The album&#x27;s title track, sung by White with the rest of the group harmonizing, would later become a poignant and prophetic epitaph for the guitarist when it was sung by ex-Byrd Gram Parsons and the Eagles&#x27; Bernie Leadon at White&#x27;s funeral in July 1973.

====Breakup====

Following the release of &quot;Farther Along&quot;, the Byrds continued to tour throughout 1972, but no new album or single release was forthcoming. Gene Parsons was fired from the group in July 1972 for a number of reasons, including McGuinn&#x27;s growing dissatisfaction with his drumming, disagreements that he and McGuinn were having over band members&#x27; pay, and his own discontent over the band&#x27;s lack of morale during this period.

Parsons was quickly replaced with L.A. session drummer John Guerin, who remained with the Byrds until January 1973, when he decided to return to studio work. Although Guerin participated in recording sessions with the band and appeared on stage with them from September 1972, he was never an official member of the Byrds and instead received a standard session musician&#x27;s wage, while continuing to undertake work for other artists as an in-demand studio player. Three officially released Byrds recordings exist of the McGuinn-White-Battin-Guerin lineup: live versions of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; and &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; that were recorded for the soundtrack of the Earl Scruggs&#x27; film &quot;Banjoman&quot;, and a studio recording of &quot;Bag Full of Money&quot; that was included as a bonus track on the remastered reissue of &quot;Farther Along&quot; in 2000.

Following Guerin&#x27;s departure, he was temporarily replaced for live performances by session drummers Dennis Dragon and Jim Moon. The band underwent a further personnel change following a show on February 10, 1973, in Ithaca, New York, when Skip Battin was dismissed by McGuinn, who had capriciously decided that the bassist&#x27;s playing abilities were no longer of a sufficient standard. McGuinn turned to ex-Byrd Chris Hillman – who at that time was a member of the band Manassas – and asked him to step in as Battin&#x27;s replacement for two upcoming shows on February 23 and 24. Hillman agreed to play both concerts for the sum of $2,000 and also brought in Manassas percussionist Joe Lala to fill the vacant spot behind the drum kit. Following a shambolic, underrehearsed performance at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, New Jersey, on February 24, 1973, McGuinn cancelled the band&#x27;s remaining concert commitments and disbanded the touring version of the Byrds, in order to make way for a reunion of the original five-piece line-up of the band.

Five months later, guitarist Clarence White was killed by a drunk driver in the early hours of July 15, 1973, while he loaded guitar equipment into the back of a van after a concert appearance in Palmdale, California.

===Reunions===

====1972–1973 reunion====
The five original members of the Byrds reunited briefly during late 1972, while McGuinn was still undertaking selected concerts with the touring version of the group. Discussions regarding a reunion between Roger McGuinn, Gene Clark, David Crosby, Chris Hillman, and Michael Clarke had taken place as early as July 1971, around the same time as the then current line-up of the band were recording the &quot;Farther Along&quot; album. Plans for a reunion accelerated in mid-1972, when the founder of Asylum Records, David Geffen, offered each of the original band members a sizable amount of money to reform and record an album for his label. The reunion actually took place in early October 1972, beginning with a rehearsal at McGuinn&#x27;s house, where the group began selecting suitable material for a new album. The five original Byrds booked into Wally Heider&#x27;s Studio 3 in Hollywood from October 16 until November 15, 1972, recording their first album together in seven years.
Following completion of the album, Crosby persuaded McGuinn to dissolve the Columbia version of the Byrds, who were still touring at that time. Crosby had long been vocal regarding his displeasure over McGuinn&#x27;s decision to recruit new band members following his dismissal from the group in 1967, and had stated in a number of interviews that in his opinion &quot;there were only ever five Byrds&quot;. In keeping with the new spirit of reconciliation that the reunion fostered, McGuinn permanently disbanded the Columbia lineup of the group in February 1973.

The reunion album, titled simply &quot;Byrds&quot;, was released on March 7, 1973, to mixed reviews. As a result, a planned tour in support of the album failed to materialize. Among the album&#x27;s shortcomings, critics made note of a lack of sonic unity and the absence of the Byrds&#x27; signature jangly guitar sound. The album managed to climb to number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart and number 31 in the UK. In the United States, the album became the band&#x27;s highest charting LP of new material since 1965&#x27;s &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot;, which had also been the last Byrds&#x27; album to feature Gene Clark as a full member. Among the tracks included on the album were McGuinn&#x27;s folk-flavored &quot;Sweet Mary&quot;, the Joni Mitchell cover &quot;For Free&quot;, a re-recording of Crosby&#x27;s song &quot;Laughing&quot; (which had originally appeared on his 1971 solo album, &quot;If I Could Only Remember My Name&quot;), and a pair of Neil Young songs. The album also featured the Gene Clark compositions &quot;Changing Heart&quot; and &quot;Full Circle&quot;, the latter of which had provided the reunion album with its working title and was subsequently released as a single, although it failed to chart.

The negative critical reception that &quot;Byrds&quot; received in the music press resulted in the band losing faith in the idea of an ongoing series of reunions. In the years following its release, all five band members were openly critical of the album, with the general consensus being that the material included on it was weak and that the recording sessions had been rushed and ill-thought out. In addition, McGuinn and Hillman have both suggested that with the exception of Gene Clark, the songwriting members of the band were reluctant to bring their strongest compositions to the recording sessions, preferring instead to hold those songs back for their own solo projects. In the wake of the reunion, the five original Byrds quietly returned to their own careers, with the June 1973 release of McGuinn&#x27;s eponymously titled solo album serving to effectively mark the end of the Byrds.

Following the reunion of 1972/1973, the Byrds remained disbanded throughout the rest of the decade. Roger McGuinn turned his attention to establishing his own career, releasing a series of solo albums between 1973 and 1977, and making a high-profile appearance with Bob Dylan&#x27;s Rolling Thunder Revue. Chris Hillman worked as part of the Souther–Hillman–Furay Band following the Byrds reunion and released a pair of solo albums entitled &quot;Slippin&#x27; Away&quot; and &quot;Clear Sailin&quot;&#x27; in 1976 and 1977 respectively. David Crosby returned to the supergroup Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young for their 1974 tour and subsequently continued to produce albums with Graham Nash. He also took part in a 1977 reunion of Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, which saw the group release their multi-platinum selling &quot;CSN&quot; album. Michael Clarke also found success following the Byrds reunion as the drummer for soft rock group Firefall, while Gene Clark returned to his solo career, producing the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful albums &quot;No Other&quot; (1974) and &quot;Two Sides to Every Story&quot; (1977).

====McGuinn, Clark &amp; Hillman (1977–1981)====

Between 1977 and 1980, McGuinn, Clark and Hillman worked on and off together as a trio, modeled after Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young and, to a lesser extent, the Eagles. This supergroup made up of former Byrds was reasonably successful commercially and managed to score a Top 40 hit with the single &quot;Don&#x27;t You Write Her Off&quot; in March 1979. The trio toured internationally and recorded the albums &quot;McGuinn, Clark &amp; Hillman&quot; and &quot;City&quot;. Clark departed the group in late 1979, resulting in a third and final album being billed as McGuinn-Hillman. The two former Byrds continued to play low-key gigs after the release of the &quot;McGuinn/Hillman&quot; album, but they split up in early 1981.

====Ersatz Byrds and further reunions (1989–1991; 2000)====
In 1984, Gene Clark approached McGuinn, Crosby, and Hillman in an attempt to reform the Byrds in time for the 20th anniversary of the release of the &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; single in 1985. None of these three original members was interested in the venture and so Clark instead assembled a group of musicians and friends, including Rick Roberts, Blondie Chaplin, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, and the ex-Byrds Michael Clarke and John York, under the banner of &quot;The 20th Anniversary Tribute to the Byrds&quot;. This tribute act began performing on the lucrative nostalgia circuit in early 1985, but a number of concert promoters began to shorten the band&#x27;s name to the Byrds in advertisements and promotional material. As the band continued to tour throughout 1985, they eventually decided to shorten their name to the Byrds themselves, prompting McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman to berate the tribute group in interviews, with McGuinn deriding the act as &quot;a cheap show&quot;.

After the tour wound down in late 1985, Clark returned to his solo career, leaving Michael Clarke to soldier on with a band that was now billed as &quot;A Tribute to the Byrds&quot; (although again, it was often shortened to the Byrds by promoters). Gene Clark returned to the group following the release of his and Carla Olson&#x27;s &quot;So Rebellious a Lover&quot; album, and the tribute band continued to work on and off in 1987 and 1988. Author Johnny Rogan has stated that most die-hard fans of the Byrds were mortified by the existence of this ersatz version of the group, while Byrds expert Tim Connors has commented that &quot;no chapter in the history of the Byrds caused as much consternation and controversy among fans&quot;.

In June 1988, McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman appeared at a concert celebrating the reopening of the Ash Grove folk club in Los Angeles. Although they were billed as solo artists, the three musicians came together for an on-stage reunion during the show, performing a string of Byrds hits including &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; and &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;. Although Clark and Clarke&#x27;s Byrds tribute group was inactive at the time of this high-profile get-together of McGuinn, Crosby, and Hillman, Michael Clarke did mount another tribute tour shortly afterwards, this time featuring former Byrd Skip Battin and newcomers Terry Jones Rogers and Jerry Sorn, under the banner of &quot;the Byrds featuring Michael Clarke&quot;. In addition, the drummer also sought to trademark the name the Byrds for his own use.

In retaliation against Clarke&#x27;s trademark application, McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman submitted their own counter-claim to gain ownership of the band&#x27;s name. McGuinn had actually attempted to trademark the Byrds name himself during the 1970s, in order to prevent its misuse, but his application had been turned down. To strengthen their case, the three musicians announced in December 1988 that they would be performing a series of concerts in January 1989 as the Byrds. Although he was no longer connected with Clarke&#x27;s tribute act, Gene Clark was not invited to participate in these official Byrds reunion concerts due to residual ill-feeling stemming from his earlier &quot;20th Anniversary Tribute to the Byrds&quot;.

The reunion concerts were a resounding success, but with Michael Clarke continuing to tour with his Byrds tribute, McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman filed a lawsuit against the drummer in the spring of 1989, suing him for allegedly false advertising, unfair competition and deceptive trade practices, as well as seeking a preliminary injunction against Clarke&#x27;s use of the name. At the court hearing in May 1989, the judge denied the injunction, ruling that McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman had failed to show that they would be irreparably damaged by Clarke&#x27;s actions. As a result, Clarke gained full legal ownership of the name the Byrds. In the wake of this ruling, McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman dropped their lawsuit, but to demonstrate that they had not wholly surrendered the Byrds name to Clarke, the three musicians appeared under the banner of the Original Byrds at a Roy Orbison tribute concert on February 24, 1990, where they were joined on-stage by Bob Dylan for a rendition of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;. Later that year, McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman entered Treasure Isle Recorders in Nashville to record four new Byrds tracks for inclusion on the forthcoming &quot;The Byrds&quot; box set.

On January 16, 1991, the five original members of the Byrds put aside their differences to appear together at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City for their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The ceremony honored the original line-up of Roger McGuinn, Gene Clark, David Crosby, Chris Hillman, and Michael Clarke, while later configurations of the group featuring such key personnel as Gram Parsons and Clarence White were quietly passed over. The occasion, which saw the band come together on stage to perform the songs &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn! (to Everything There Is a Season)&quot;, &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Feel a Whole Lot Better&quot;, represented the first time that all five original Byrds had stood together since 1973. Unfortunately, it would also represent the last time that the five original members were gathered together. Clark died later that year of heart failure, and on December 19, 1993, Clarke succumbed to liver disease brought on by alcoholism.

Following Clarke&#x27;s death, Terry Jones Rogers resurrected the Byrds tribute act, with guitarist Scott Nienhaus and former Byrds Skip Battin and Gene Parsons on bass and drums respectively. Performing under the banner of the Byrds Celebration, the tribute group toured extensively throughout the remainder of the 1990s, although Parsons was replaced by session drummer Vince Barranco in 1995 and Battin was forced to retire due to ill-health in 1997. Since 2002, Rogers and Nienhaus have continued to tour as part of the band Younger Than Yesterday: A Tribute to the Byrds, along with bassist Michael Curtis and drummer Tim Politte.
McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman all returned to their individual solo careers following the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony. The Byrds did reunite for a third time on August 8, 2000, to give an impromptu, one-off performance at a tribute concert for Fred Walecki, the owner of a Los Angeles music equipment store who was suffering from throat cancer. Crosby and Hillman were booked to appear at the event separately, but McGuinn, who was not listed on the bill, made a surprise appearance and joined his two former partners on stage. McGuinn introduced the hastily reformed trio with the words, &quot;And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Byrds&quot;, as the group launched into renditions of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; and &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn! (to Everything There Is a Season)&quot;. According to contemporary press reports, the reunion was an unmitigated success, with the audience giving the band multiple standing ovations and shouting for more as they left the stage.

During the 2000s, two more ex-members of the Byrds died when drummer Kevin Kelley succumbed of natural causes in 2002 and bassist Skip Battin, who was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, died at his home in 2003. Former members Gene Parsons and John York both remain active and continue to perform and record various musical projects.

Perhaps the most surprising development in the Byrds&#x27; story during the 2000s was the acquisition by David Crosby of the rights to the band&#x27;s name in 2002. Ownership of the Byrds&#x27; name had reverted to Clarke&#x27;s estate upon his death in 1993 and Crosby&#x27;s purchase served to effectively bring the convoluted battle for control of the group&#x27;s name to an end.

To date, the Fred Walecki tribute concert appearance in 2000 was the last performance by the Byrds. However, Hillman and Crosby both expressed an interest in working with McGuinn again on Byrds projects, but the lead guitarist and head Byrd remained adamant that he was not interested in another full reunion. During an interview with music journalist John Nork, McGuinn replied &quot;absolutely not&quot;, when asked if he had any plans to revive the Byrds, explaining, &quot;No, I don&#x27;t want to do that. I just want to be a solo artist. The Byrds are well documented. I don&#x27;t think we need anymore from the Byrds.&quot;

In spite of McGuinn&#x27;s comments, he and Hillman undertook a series of concerts together in 2018 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; album. Though not billed as the Byrds, the duo, together with backing band Marty Stuart and his Fabulous Superlatives, played some earlier Byrds&#x27; material before performing all of the songs from the album and telling stories about its creation. An album of live recordings from the 50th Anniversary concerts was released for Record Store Day 2024.

On January 18, 2023, David Crosby died in his sleep at age 81, following years of health issues. His death left McGuinn and Hillman as the two remaining original members.

==Legacy==
Since the band&#x27;s 1960s heyday, the influence of the Byrds on successive generations of rock and pop musicians has grown steadily, with acts such as the Eagles, Big Star, Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, R.E.M., the Bangles, the Smiths, and innumerable alternative rock bands of the post-punk era all exhibiting signs of their influence. Musician and author Peter Lavezzoli described the Byrds in 2007 as &quot;one of the few bands to exert a decisive influence on the Beatles&quot;, while also noting that they helped to persuade Bob Dylan to begin recording with electric instrumentation. Lavezzoli concluded that &quot;like it or not, terms like &#x27;folk rock&#x27;, &#x27;raga rock&#x27; and &#x27;country rock&#x27; were coined for a reason: the Byrds did it first, and then kept moving, never staying in the &#x27;raga&#x27; or &#x27;country&#x27; mode for very long. This is precisely what made the Byrds such a rewarding band to follow from one record to the next&quot;.

In their book &quot;Beyond and Before: Progressive Rock Since the 1960s&quot;, academics Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell placed the Byrds among a list of bands that they included in the book &quot;not merely as precursors of prog but as essential developments of progressiveness in its early days&quot;. In &quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;, music researcher Martin C. Strong describes the Byrds&#x27; cover of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; as &quot;a timeless slice of hypnotic, bittersweet pop&quot; and a record that &quot;did nothing less than change the course of pop/rock history&quot;. Author and musician Bob Stanley, writing in his 2013 book &quot;Yeah Yeah Yeah: The Story of Modern Pop&quot;, has called the Byrds&#x27; music &quot;a phenomenon, a drone, genuinely hair-raising and totally American&quot;.

Music historian Domenic Priore attempted to sum up the band&#x27;s influence in his book &quot;Riot on Sunset Strip: Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&#x27;s Last Stand in 60s Hollywood&quot;, by stating: &quot;Few of The Byrds&#x27; contemporaries can claim to have made such a subversive impact on popular culture. The band had a much larger, more positive impact on the world at large than any &quot;Billboard&quot; chart position or album sales or concert attendance figure could possibly measure.&quot;

In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the Byrds at number 45 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2006, they were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.
