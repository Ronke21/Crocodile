<text>MI5 (Military Intelligence, Section 5), officially the Security Service, is the United Kingdom&#x27;s domestic counter-intelligence and security agency and is part of its intelligence machinery alongside the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), and Defence Intelligence (DI). MI5 is directed by the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), and the service is bound by the Security Service Act 1989. The service is directed to protect British parliamentary democracy and economic interests and to counter terrorism and espionage within the United Kingdom. Within the civil service community, the service is colloquially known as &quot;Box&quot;, or &quot;Box 500&quot;, after its official wartime address of PO Box 500; its current address is PO Box 3255, London SW1P 1AE.

The Security Service is derived from the Secret Service Bureau, founded in 1909. At the start of the First World War, it was responsible for the arrest of enemy spies, or suspected enemy spies. Throughout the First World War, Germany continually attempted to infiltrate Britain, but MI5 was able to identify most, if not all, of the agents dispatched. During the Second World War, it developed the Double-Cross System. This involved attempting to &#x27;turn&#x27; captured agents wherever possible, and use them to mislead enemy intelligence agencies.

After the war, the service was instrumental in breaking up a large Soviet spy ring at the start of the 1970s. It then allegedly became involved in monitoring trade unions and left-wing politicians. It also assumed responsibility for the investigation of all Irish republican activity within Britain during The Troubles. Its role was then expanded to countering other forms of terrorism, particularly in more recent years the more widespread threat of Islamic extremism. In 1996, legislation formalised the extension of the Security Service&#x27;s statutory remit to include supporting the law enforcement agencies in their work against serious crime.

==Organisation==
=== Structure ===
The Security Service comes under the authority of the Home Secretary within the Cabinet. The service is headed by a Director General (DG) at the grade of a Permanent Secretary of the Civil Service, who is directly supported by an internal security organisation, secretariat, legal advisory branch, and information services branch. The Deputy Director General is responsible for the operational activity of the service, being responsible for four branches; international counter-terrorism, National Security Advice Centre (counter proliferation and counter espionage), Irish and domestic counter-terrorism, and technical and surveillance operations.

The service is directed for intelligence operational priorities by the Joint Intelligence Committee. It liaises with SIS, GCHQ, DI, and a number of other bodies within the British government, and industrial base. It is overseen by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Members of Parliament, who are directly appointed by the Prime Minister, and by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner. Judicial oversight of the service&#x27;s conduct is exercised by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.

=== Legislation ===
Operations of the service are required to be proportionate, and compliant with British legislation, including the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, the Data Protection Act 2018, and various other items of legislation. Information held by the service is exempt from disclosure under section 23 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The Security Service Act of 1989 establishes several legal key mechanisms aimed at ensuring the accountability and control of the Service. Certain provisions from this act were later integrated into the Intelligence Services Act of 1994 with European Commission on Human Rights later having endorsed these mechanisms in multiple applications under the European Convention on Human Rights. Additionally, the Service is subject to oversight and accountability through various other means. These oversight mechanisms have evolved over time to meet changing governmental requirements, with the Service now being held accountable through a variety of oversight arrangements.
=== Oversight ===
All employees of the service are bound by the Official Secrets Act. In certain circumstances, officers handling agents or informers may authorise them to carry out activity which would otherwise be criminal within the United Kingdom. The Security Service &quot;is authorised to investigate any person or movement that might threaten the...security&quot; of the United Kingdom. The current Director General is Ken McCallum, who succeeded Andrew Parker in April 2020.

=== Centenary and awards ===
The service marked its centenary in 2009 by publishing an official history titled &quot;The Defence of the Realm: The Authorized History of MI5&quot;, written by Christopher Andrew, Professor of Modern and Contemporary History at Cambridge University. Members of the Security Service are recognised annually by King Charles III at the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Intelligence Community Awards at St James&#x27;s Palace or Clarence House alongside members of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), and GCHQ. Awards and citations are given to teams within the agencies as well as individuals.

==History==
===Early years===
The Security Service is derived from the Secret Service Bureau, founded in 1909, and concentrating originally on the activities of the Imperial German government, as a joint initiative of the Admiralty and the War Office. The Bureau was initially split into naval and army sections which, over time, specialised respectively in foreign target espionage and internal counter-espionage activities. The former specialisation was a result of a growing interest at the Admiralty, at the time, in intelligence regarding the fleet of the Imperial German Navy. This division was formalised, as separate home and foreign sections, prior to the beginning of the First World War. Following a number of administrative changes, the home section became known as Directorate of Military Intelligence, Section 5 and the abbreviation MI5, the name by which it is still known in popular culture. (The foreign/naval section of the Secret Service Bureau was to become the basis of the later Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6.)

The founding head of the Army section was Vernon Kell of the South Staffordshire Regiment, who remained in that role until the early part of the Second World War. Its role was originally quite restricted, as the section existed solely to ensure national security through counter-espionage. With a small staff, and working in conjunction with the Special Branch of the Metropolitan Police, the service was responsible for overall direction and the identification of foreign agents, while Special Branch provided the manpower for the investigation of their affairs, arrest and interrogation.

On the day after the declaration of the First World War, the Home Secretary, Reginald McKenna, announced that &quot;within the last twenty-four hours no fewer than twenty-one spies, or suspected spies, have been arrested in various places all over the country, chiefly in important military or naval centres, some of them long known to the authorities to be spies&quot;. These arrests have provoked recent historical controversy. According to the official history of MI5, the actual number of agents identified was 22, and Kell had started sending out letters to local police forces on 29 July, giving them advance warning of arrests to be made as soon as war was declared. Portsmouth Constabulary jumped the gun and arrested one on 3 August, and not all of the 22 were in custody by the time that McKenna made his speech, but the official history regards the incident as a devastating blow to Imperial Germany, which deprived them of their entire spy ring, and specifically upset the Kaiser.

In 2006, his article &#x27;Entering the Lists&#x27; was published in the journal &quot;Intelligence and National Security&quot;, outlining the products of his research into recently opened files. Hiley was sent an advance copy of the official history, and objected to the retelling of the story. He later wrote another article, &#x27;Re-entering the Lists&#x27;, which asserted that the list of those arrested published in the official history was concocted from later case histories.

===Inter-war period===
MI5 proved consistently successful throughout the rest of the 1910s and 1920s in its core counter-espionage role. Throughout the First World War, Germany continually attempted to infiltrate Britain, but MI5 was able to identify most, if not all, of the agents dispatched. MI5 used a method that depended on strict control of entry and exit to the country and, crucially, large-scale inspection of mail. In post-war years, attention turned to attempts by the Soviet Union and the Comintern to surreptitiously support revolutionary activities within Britain. MI5&#x27;s expertise, combined with the early incompetence of the Soviets, meant the bureau was successful in correctly identifying and closely monitoring these activities.

In the meantime, MI5&#x27;s role had grown substantially. Due to the spy hysteria, MI5 had formed with far more resources than it actually needed to track down German spies. As is common within governmental bureaucracies, this caused the service to expand its role to use its spare resources. MI5 acquired many additional responsibilities during the war. Most significantly, its strict counter-espionage role blurred considerably. It acquired a much more political role, involving the surveillance not merely of foreign agents, but also of pacifist and anti-conscription organisations, and of organised labour. This was justified by citing the common belief that foreign influence was at the root of these organisations. Thus, by the end of the First World War, MI5 was a fully-fledged investigating force (although it never had powers of arrest), in addition to being a counter-espionage agency. The expansion of this role continued after a brief post-war power struggle with the head of the Special Branch, Sir Basil Thomson.

After the First World War, budget-conscious politicians regarded Kell&#x27;s department as unnecessary. In 1919, MI5&#x27;s budget was slashed from £100,000 to just £35,000, and its establishment from over 800 officers to a mere 12. At the same time, Sir Basil Thomson of Special Branch was appointed Director of Home Intelligence, in supreme command of all domestic counter-insurgency and counter-intelligence investigations. Consequently, as official MI5 historian Christopher Andrew has noted in his official history &quot;Defence of the Realm&quot; (2010), MI5 had no clearly defined role in the Anglo-Irish War of 1919–1921. To further worsen the situation, several of Kell&#x27;s officers defected to Thomson&#x27;s new agency, the Home Intelligence Directorate. MI5 therefore undertook no tangible intelligence operations of consequence during the Irish War of Independence. MI5 did undertake the training of British Army case-officers from the Department of Military Intelligence (DMI), for the Army&#x27;s so-called &quot;Silent Section&quot;, otherwise known as M04(x). Quickly trained by MI5 veterans at Hounslow Barracks, outside London, these freshly-minted M04(x) Army case-officers were deployed to Dublin beginning in the spring of 1919. Over time, 175 officers were trained and dispatched to Ireland. In Ireland, they came under the command of General Cecil Romer and his Deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Searle Hill-Dillon.

In April 1919, Colonel Walter Wilson of the Department of Military Intelligence arrived in Dublin to take over the day-to-day management of these 175 Army intelligence-officers, and the unit was designated as the &quot;Dublin District Special Branch&quot; (DMI/MO4(x)/DDSB), because it operated exclusively within the confines of the Army&#x27;s Dublin Military District. Royal Marine Colonel Hugh Montgomery of the Department of Naval Intelligence, was also seconded to Romer&#x27;s intelligence staff at this time. British Army after-action reports and contemporary accounts indicate that M04(x)/DDSB was considered by some a highly amateurish outfit. Serious cover constraints, coupled with alcohol abuse and social fraternisation with local prostitutes would prove the downfall of several of these amateur sleuths. Despite these failings, it was not MI5, but one of Basil Thomson&#x27;s agents, John Charles Byrnes, a double agent within the IRA, who identified Michael Collins, and came close to arranging his capture. The IRA identified Byrnes as a British spy and murdered him in March 1920.

The intelligence staff of Michael Collins Irish Republican Army penetrated the unit. Using DMP detectives Ned Broy and David Nelligan, Michael Collins was able to learn the names and lodgings of the M04(x) agents, referred to by IRA operatives as &quot;The Cairo Gang&quot;. On &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;, 21 November 1920, Collins ordered his counter-intelligence unit, The Squad, to assassinate 25 M04(x) agents, several British courts-martial officers, at least one agent reporting to Basil Thomson, and several intelligence officers attached to the Royal Irish Constabulary Auxiliary Division, at their lodgings throughout Dublin. That afternoon, a mixed force of the British Army, the Royal Irish Constabulary, and the Black and Tans retaliated by indiscriminately shooting dead 14 civilians at a Gaelic Football match at Croke Park. 

The net impact of Collins&#x27;s strike of Bloody Sunday, 21 November 1920, was relatively negligible, even though the IRA had not gone up against MI5 professionals, but instead only against a quickly trained outfit of amateur army &quot;D-Listers&quot;. Although the shooting of 14 British officers had the desired effect on British morale, other aspects were botched by the IRA. Three of Collins&#x27;s men were apprehended after engaging in a shoot-out on the street, and at least two of the wounded British officers had no connection whatsoever to British intelligence. Moreover, with MO4(x) having fielded a total of 175 agents of the DDSB, Collins&#x27;s operation only temporarily slowed British momentum. Within days, the remaining 160-odd M04(x) agents were re-established in secure quarters inside solidly loyalist hotels in Dublin, from where they continued to pursue Collins and the IRA relentlessly right up until the truce of July 1921.

In December 1920, the entire DDSB was transferred from British Army command to civil command under Deputy Police Commissioner General Ormonde Winter, and thereafter was known as &quot;D Branch&quot; within Dublin Castle. By January 1921, the highly experienced MI6 operative David Boyle arrived at Dublin Castle to take over the day-to-day management of D Branch. The unit&#x27;s former commander, Colonel Wilson, resigned in protest against having had his command taken from him. D Branch thrived under Boyle&#x27;s leadership. 

In 1921, Sir Warren Fisher, the government inspector-general for civil-service affairs, conducted a thorough review of the operations and expenditures of Basil Thomson&#x27;s Home Intelligence Directorate. He issued a scathing report, accusing Thomson of wasting both money and resources, and conducting redundant as well as ineffectual operations. Shortly thereafter, in a private meeting with Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Sir Basil Thomson was sacked, and the Home Intelligence Directorate was formally abolished. With Thomson out of the way, Special Branch was returned to the command of the Commissioner of The Criminal Investigation Division at Scotland Yard. Only then was Vernon Kell able once again to rebuild MI5 and re-establish it in its former place as Britain&#x27;s chief domestic spy agency.

MI5 operated in Italy during inter-war period, and helped Benito Mussolini get his start in politics with a £100 weekly wage. MI5&#x27;s efficiency in counter-espionage declined from the 1930s. It was to some extent a victim of its own success as it was unable to break the ways of thinking it had evolved in the 1910s and 1920s. In particular, it was unable to adjust to the new methods of the Soviet intelligence services, the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) and Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). It continued to think in terms of agents who would attempt to gather information simply through observation or bribery, or to agitate within labour organisations and the armed services, while posing as ordinary citizens. The NKVD, meanwhile, had evolved more sophisticated methods; it began to recruit agents from within the upper classes (most notably from Cambridge University), whom it regarded as a long-term investment. Such NKVD agents succeeded in gaining positions within the government, and, in Kim Philby&#x27;s case, within British intelligence itself, from where they were able to provide the NKVD with sensitive information. The most successful of these agents; Harold &#x27;Kim&#x27; Philby, Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess, Anthony Blunt, and John Cairncross; went undetected until after the Second World War, and became known as the Cambridge Five.

===Second World War===
One of the earliest actions of Winston Churchill on coming to power in early 1940 was to sack the agency&#x27;s long-term head, Vernon Kell. He was replaced initially by the ineffective Oswald Allen Harker, as Acting Director General. Harker in turn was quickly replaced by David Petrie, a Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) man, with Harker remaining as his deputy. With the ending of the Battle of Britain, and the abandonment of invasion plans (correctly reported by both SIS and the Bletchley Park Ultra project), the spy scare eased, and the internment policy was gradually reversed. This eased pressure on MI5, and allowed it to concentrate on its major wartime success, the so-called &#x27;double-cross&#x27; system. This was a system based on an internal memo drafted by an MI5 officer in 1936, which criticised the long-standing policy of arresting and sending to trial all enemy agents discovered by MI5. Several had offered to defect to Britain when captured; before 1939, such requests were invariably turned down. The memo advocated attempting to &#x27;turn&#x27; captured agents wherever possible, and use them to mislead enemy intelligence agencies. This suggestion was turned into a massive and well-tuned system of deception during the Second World War.

Beginning with the capture of an agent named Arthur Owens, codenamed &#x27;Snow&#x27;, MI5 began to offer enemy agents the chance to avoid prosecution (and thus the possibility of the death penalty) if they would work as British double-agents. Agents who agreed to this were supervised by MI5 in transmitting bogus &#x27;intelligence&#x27; back to the German secret service, the Abwehr. This necessitated a large-scale organisational effort, since the information had to appear valuable but actually be misleading. A high-level committee, the Wireless Board, was formed to provide this information. The day-to-day operation was delegated to a sub-committee, the Twenty Committee (so called because the Roman numerals for twenty, XX, form a double cross). The system was extraordinarily successful. A post-war analysis of German intelligence records found that of the 115 or so agents targeted against Britain during the war, all but one (who committed suicide) had been successfully identified and caught, with several &#x27;turned&#x27; to become double agents. The system played a major part in the massive campaign of deception which preceded the D-Day landings, designed to give the Germans a false impression of the location and timings of the landings (see Operation Fortitude).

While the double-cross work dealt with enemy agents sent into Britain, a smaller-scale operation run by Victor Rothschild targeted British citizens who wanted to help Germany. The &#x27;Fifth Column&#x27; operation saw an MI5 officer, Eric Roberts, masquerade as the Gestapo&#x27;s man in London, encouraging Nazi sympathisers to pass him information about people who would be willing to help Germany in the event of invasion. When his recruits began bringing in intelligence, he promised to pass that on to Berlin. The operation was deeply controversial within MI5, with opponents arguing that it amounted to entrapment. By the end of the war, Roberts had identified around 500 people. But MI5 decided not to prosecute, and instead covered the work up, even giving some of Roberts&#x27; recruits Nazi medals. They were never told the truth.

All foreigners entering the country were processed at the London Reception Centre (LRC) at the Royal Victoria Patriotic Building, which was operated by MI5 subsection B1D; 30,000 were inspected at LRC. Captured enemy agents were taken to Camp 020, Latchmere House, for interrogation. This was commanded by Colonel Robin Stephens. There was a reserve camp, Camp 020R, at Huntercombe, which was used mainly for long term detention of prisoners. It is believed that two MI5 officers participated in &quot;a gentle interrogation&quot; given to the senior Nazi Heinrich Himmler after his arrest at a military checkpoint in the northern German village of Bremervörde in May 1945. Himmler subsequently killed himself during a medical examination by a British officer by means of a cyanide capsule that he had concealed in his mouth. One of the MI5 officers, Sidney Henry Noakes of the Intelligence Corps, was subsequently given permission to keep Himmler&#x27;s braces and the forged identity document that had led to his arrest.

===Post-Second World War===
The Prime Minister&#x27;s personal responsibility for the service was delegated to the Home Secretary David Maxwell-Fyfe in 1952, with a directive issued by the Home Secretary setting out the role and objectives of the Director General. The service was subsequently placed on a statutory basis in 1989 with the introduction of the Security Service Act. This was the first government acknowledgement of the existence of the service. The post-war period was a difficult time for the service, with a significant change in the threat as the Cold War began, being challenged by an extremely active KGB, and increasing incidence of the Northern Ireland conflict, and international terrorism. Whilst little has yet been released regarding the successes of the service, there have been a number of intelligence failures which have created embarrassment for both the service and the government. For instance, in 1983, one of its officers, Michael Bettaney, was caught trying to sell information to the KGB. He was subsequently convicted of espionage.

Following the Michael Bettaney case, Philip Woodfield was appointed as a staff counsellor for the security and intelligence services. His role was to be available to be consulted by any member or former member of the security and intelligence services who had &quot;anxieties relating to the work of his or her service&quot; that it had not been possible to allay through the ordinary processes of management-staff relations, including proposals for publications. The service was instrumental in breaking up a large Soviet spy ring at the start of the 1970s, with 105 Soviet embassy staff known or suspected to be involved in intelligence activities being expelled from the country in 1971.

One episode involving MI5 and the BBC came to light in the mid-1980s. MI5 officer Ronnie Stonham had an office in the BBC, and took part in vetting procedures. Controversy arose when it was alleged that the service was monitoring trade unions and left-wing politicians. A file was kept on Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson from 1945, when he became a Member of Parliament (MP), although the agency&#x27;s official historian, Christopher Andrew maintains that his fears of MI5 conspiracies and bugging were unfounded. As Home Secretary, the Labour MP Jack Straw discovered the existence of his own file dating from his days as a student radical.

One of the most significant and far-reaching failures was an inability to conclusively detect and apprehend the &#x27;Cambridge Five&#x27; spy ring, which had formed in the inter-war years, and achieved great success in penetrating the government, and the intelligence agencies themselves. Related to this failure were suggestions of a high-level penetration within the service, Peter Wright (especially in his controversial book &quot;Spycatcher&quot;) and others believing that evidence implicated the former Director General, Roger Hollis, or his deputy Graham Mitchell. The Trend inquiry of 1974 found the case unproven of that accusation, and that view was later supported by the former KGB officer Oleg Gordievsky. Another spy ring, the Portland spy ring, exposed after a tip-off by Soviet defector Michael Goleniewski, led to an extensive MI5 surveillance operation.

In 1991, MI5 revealed its head publicly for the first time and declassified some information, &quot;such as the number of its employees and its organizational structure.&quot; There have been strong accusations levelled against MI5 for having failed in its obligation to provide care for former police agents who had infiltrated the Provisional IRA during the Troubles. The two most notable of the agents, Martin McGartland and Raymond Gilmour, went on to reside in England using false identities, and in 2012, launched test cases against the agency. Both men claimed to journalist Liam Clarke in the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; that they were abandoned by MI5 and were &quot;left high and dry despite severe health problems as a result of their work and lavish promises of life-time care from their former Intelligence bosses&quot;. Both men suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Following the United States invasion of Afghanistan, on 9 January 2002, the first MI5 staff arrived at Bagram. On 12 January 2002, following a report by an MI6 officer that a detainee appeared to have been mistreated before, an MI6 officer was sent instructions that were copied to all MI5 and MI6 staff in Afghanistan about how to deal with concerns over mistreatment, referring to signs of abuse: &#x27;Given that they are not within our custody or control, the law does not require you to intervene to protect this&#x27;. It went on to say that the Americans had to understand that the UK did not condone such mistreatment, and that a complaint should be made to a senior US official if there was any coercion by the US in conjunction with an MI6 interview.

===The Security Service&#x27;s role in counter-terrorism===

The end of the Cold War resulted in a change in emphasis for the operations of the service, assuming responsibility for the investigation of all Irish republican activity within Britain, and increasing the effort countering other forms of terrorism, particularly in more recent years the more widespread threat of Islamic extremism.

Whilst the British security forces in Northern Ireland have provided support in the countering of both republican and loyalist paramilitary groups since the early 1970s, republican sources have often accused these forces of collusion with loyalists. In 2006, an Irish government committee inquiry found that there was widespread collusion between British security forces and loyalist terrorists in the 1970s, which resulted in eighteen deaths. In 2012, a document based review by Sir Desmond de Silva QC into the 1989 murder of Belfast solicitor Patrick Finucane found that MI5 had colluded with the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). The review disclosed that MI5 assessments of UDA intelligence consistently noted that the majority came from MI5 sources, with an assessment in 1985 finding 85% came from MI5. Prime Minister David Cameron accepted the findings, and apologised on behalf of the British government, and acknowledged significant levels of collusion with Loyalists in its state agencies.

On 10 October 2007, the lead responsibility for national security intelligence in Northern Ireland returned to the Security Service from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), that had been devolved in 1976 to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) during Ulsterisation. During April 2010, the Real IRA detonated a 120 lb car bomb outside Palace Barracks in County Down, which is the headquarters of MI5 in Northern Ireland and also home to the 2nd Battalion The Mercian Regiment.

MI5 is understood to have a close working relationship with the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s Special Detective Unit (SDU), the counter-terrorism and counter-intelligence section of the Garda Síochána (national police), particularly with regards to threats from dissident republican terrorism and Islamic terrorism.

Executive liaison groups enable MI5 to safely share secret, sensitive, and often raw intelligence with the police, on which decisions can be made about how best to gather evidence and prosecute suspects in the courts. Each organisation works in partnership throughout the investigation, but MI5 retain the lead for collecting, assessing and exploiting intelligence. The police take lead responsibility for gathering evidence, obtaining arrests, and preventing risks to the public.

===Serious crime===
In 1996, legislation formalised the extension of the Security Service&#x27;s statutory remit to include supporting the law enforcement agencies in their work against serious crime. Tasking was reactive, acting at the request of law enforcement bodies such as the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS), for whom MI5 officers performed electronic surveillance and eavesdropping duties during Operation Trinity. This role has subsequently been passed to the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and then the National Crime Agency (NCA).

===Surveillance===
In 2001, after the September 11 attacks in the US, MI5 started collecting bulk telephone communications data under a little understood general power of the Telecommunications Act 1984 (instead of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 which would have brought independent oversight and regulation). This was kept secret until announced by the Home Secretary in 2015. This power was replaced by the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 which introduced new surveillance powers overseen by the Investigatory Powers Commission (IPC) it introduces.

In July 2006, parliamentarian Norman Baker accused the British Government of &quot;hoarding information about people who pose no danger to this country&quot;, after it emerged that MI5 holds secret files on 272,000 individuals, equivalent to one in 160 adults. It had previously been revealed that a &#x27;traffic light&#x27; system operates:
*Green: active; about 10% of files
*Amber: enquiries prohibited, further information may be added; about 46% of files
*Red: enquiries prohibited, substantial information may not be added; about 44% of files.

===Participation of MI5 officers in criminal activity===
In March 2018, the government acknowledged that MI5 officers are allowed to authorise agents to commit criminal activity in the UK. Maya Foa, the director of Reprieve, said: &quot;After a seven-month legal battle, the prime minister has finally been forced to publish her secret order, but we are a long way from having transparency. The public and parliament are still being denied the guidance that says when British spies can commit criminal offences, and how far they can go. Authorised criminality is the most intrusive power a state can wield. Theresa May must publish this guidance without delay&quot;.

In November 2019, four human rights organisations claimed that the UK government has a policy dating from the 1990s to allow MI5 officers to authorise agents or informers to participate in crime, and to immunise them against prosecution for criminal actions. The organisations said the policy allowed MI5 officers to authorise agents and informers to participate in criminal activities that protected national security or the economic well-being of the UK. The organisations took the UK government to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, seeking to have it declare the policy illegal, and to issue an injunction against further &#x27;unlawful conduct&#x27;. In December 2019, the tribunal dismissed the request of the human rights organisations in a 3-to-2 decision. The potential criminal activities include murder, kidnap, and torture, according to a Bloomberg report.

===Allegations of collusion in torture===
In October 2020, Rangzieb Ahmed brought a civil claim against MI5, alleging that Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence agency had arrested him in 2006, and that MI5 had colluded in torture by submitting questions which were put to him under torture in Pakistan. This claim was rejected by the High Court on 16 December 2020.

==Buildings==
MI5 was based at Watergate House in the Strand from 1912 until 1916, when it moved to larger facilities at 16 Charles Street for the remaining years of the First World War. After the First World War, it relocated to smaller premises at 73–75 Queen&#x27;s Gate in 1919, and then moved to 35 Cromwell Road in 1929, before transferring to the top floor of the South Block of Thames House on Millbank in 1934. The Service spent the first year of the Second World War at Wormwood Scrubs, before moving to Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, in 1940. After the Second World War, MI5 was based at Leconfield House (1945–1976), and 140 Gower Street (1976–1994, since demolished), before returning to Thames House in 1994.

The national headquarters at Thames House draws together personnel from a number of locations into a single HQ facility: Thames House also houses the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), a subordinate organisation to the Security Service; prior to March 2013, Thames House additionally housed the Northern Ireland Office (NIO). The service has offices across the United Kingdom, including a HQ in Northern Ireland. Details of a northern operations centre in Greater Manchester were revealed by the firm who built it.

==Life and career==

George Gallup, Jr., was born in Jefferson, Iowa, the son of Nettie Quella (Davenport) and George Henry Gallup, a dairy farmer. As a teen, &quot;Ted&quot; would deliver milk and used his earnings to start a newspaper at his high school. He attended the University of Iowa, earning his B.A. in 1923, his M.A. in 1925 and his Ph.D. in 1928. While there he was a member of the Iowa Beta chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and edited of &quot;The Daily Iowan&quot;, the campus newspaper. 

He then moved first to Des Moines, Iowa, where he served until 1931 as head of the Department of Journalism at Drake University, then to Evanston, Illinois, as a professor of journalism and advertising at Northwestern University. He moved to New York City in 1932 to join the advertising agency of Young and Rubicam as director of research, serving as vice president there from 1937 to 1947. He was also a professor of journalism at Columbia University, but relinquished the position shortly after he formed his own polling company, the American Institute of Public Opinion, in 1935.

Gallup had first become involved in polling in 1932, when he did some for his mother-in-law, Ola Babcock Miller, a longshot candidate for Iowa Secretary of State. She was swept in with the Democratic landslide of that year, furthering Gallup&#x27;s interest in politics.

In 1936, his new organization achieved national recognition by correctly predicting that Franklin Roosevelt would defeat Alf Landon in the U.S. Presidential election, besting a poll based on over two million returned questionnaires conducted by the widely-respected &quot;Literary Digest&quot; magazine. Gallup&#x27;s poll was based on a more representative sample of the American electorate reflected in just 50,000 more selectively chosen respondents. He also correctly predicted the results of the &quot;Literary Digest&quot; poll a random sample smaller than theirs but chosen to match its profile.

Twelve years later, his organization suffered its moment of greatest ignominy by predicting that Thomas Dewey would defeat Harry S. Truman in the 1948 election by between 5% and 15%. Truman won the election by 4.5%, with Gallup attributing the error in his results to ending polling three weeks before Election Day, which failed to account for an unexpected Truman&#x27;s comeback.

In 1947, he launched the Gallup International Association, an international association of polling organizations. With friends-cum-rivals Elmo Roper and Archibald Crossley, he was instrumental in the establishment of the Market Research Council, the National Council on Public Polls, and the American Association for Public Opinion Research. In 1948, with Claude E. Robinson, he founded Gallup &amp; Robinson, an advertising research company.

In 1958, Gallup grouped all of his polling operations under what became The Gallup Organization.

Gallup died in 1984 of a heart attack at his summer home in Tschingel ob Gunten, a village in the Bernese Oberland of Switzerland. He was buried in Princeton Cemetery. His wife, the former Ophelia S. Miller, died in 1988, and their son, writer and pollster George Gallup Jr., died in 2011.

<doc id="100078" wikidata="Q237248" url="?curid=100078" title="Philip V of Macedon">
<text>Philip V (; 238–179 BC) was king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon from 221 to 179 BC. Philip&#x27;s reign was principally marked by the Social War in Greece (220-217 BC) and a struggle with the emerging power of the Roman Republic. He would lead Macedon against Rome in the First (212-205 BC) and Second (200-196 BC) Macedonian Wars. While he lost the latter, Philip later allied with Rome against Antiochus III in the Roman-Seleucid War. He died in 179 BC from illness after efforts to recover the military and economic condition of Macedonia and passed the throne onto his elder son, Perseus of Macedon.

==Early life==

Philip was the son of Demetrius II of Macedon, and either Phthia of Macedon or Chryseis. Philip was nine years old when his father died in 229 BC. His elder paternal half-sister was Apama III. Philip&#x27;s great-uncle, Antigonus III Doson, administered the kingdom as regent and then king until his death in 221 BC when Philip was seventeen years old (Plb. 4.2.5, 4.5.3-4; Just. 28.4.16, 29.1.1).

Philip was attractive and charismatic as a young man. A dashing and courageous warrior, he was compared to Alexander the Great, modelled himself on Philip II, and is said by Polybius to have become &quot;a universal beloved of the Greeks&quot; () because of his benevolent conduct towards them. He had a close relationship with Aratus of Sicyon, who until 213 BC held a prestigious position at his court.

After ascending to the throne, in the first year of his reign Philip V pushed back the Dardani and other tribes in the north of Macedonia.

==The Social War==
The Social War (220–217 BC) began following the establishment of the Hellenic League (Symmachy) of Greek federations (eventually including the Achaeans, Acarnanians, Boeotians, Euboeans, Magnesians, Messenians, and Thessalians) was assembled in Corinth in 224 BC at the instigation of Antigonus III Doson, the uncle and predecessor of Philip V. Philip took over leadership of the Hellenic League in 221/0 BC and led the Hellenic League on a three-year war against Aetolia, Sparta and Elis. Following the sack of Thermum, the Aetolian political and religious capital, the Aetolians agreed to peace. Philip&#x27;s troops destroyed 2,000 statues and hauled away vast sums of treasure which included some fifteen thousand shields and suits of arms with which the Aetolians had decorated their stoas (Plb. 5.9). These shields were the arms taken from the enemies of the Aetolians during their previous military victories and included the shields of the Gauls who had raided Greece in the 3rd century BC. 

Philip and his Greek allies in the Hellenic League ultimately claimed victory against the Aetolians, Spartans and Elians at the conference of Naupactus in 217 BC (Plb. 5.102-105). During the war, Philip V was able to stabilise and increase his own authority amongst his own ministers and became well-known and respected for his leadership and military prowess among the Greeks (Plb. 4.77.1-4; 5.104.4-11; 7.11.4-6).

==First Macedonian War (214–205 BC)==

After the Peace of Naupactus in 217 BC, Philip V tried to replace Roman influence along the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea, forming alliances or lending patronage to certain island and coastal provinces such as Lato on Crete. He first tried to invade Illyria from the sea, but with limited success. His first expedition in 216 BC had to be aborted, while he suffered the loss of his whole fleet in a second expedition in 214 BC. A later expedition by land met with greater success when he captured Lissus in 212 BC.

In 215 BC, Philip V signed a Macedonian–Carthaginian Treaty with Hannibal Barca the Carthaginian general (Plb. 7.9; Livy 23.33, 38.7). Their treaty defined spheres of operation and interest, but achieved little of substance or value for either side. Philip V became heavily involved in assisting and protecting his allies from attacks from the Spartans, the Romans and their allies.

Rome&#x27;s alliance with the Aetolian League in 211 BC effectively neutralised Philip&#x27;s advantage on land (Livy 26.24.6-11). The intervention of Attalus I of Pergamum on the Roman side further exposed Philip&#x27;s position in Macedonia. Philip was able to take advantage of the withdrawal of Attalus from the Greek mainland in 207 BC, along with Roman inactivity and the increasing role of Philopoemen, the strategos of the Achaean League. Philip and his troops sacked Thermum, the religious and political centre of Aetolia for the second time, destroying any remaining structures (Plb. 11.7.2), and the king was able to force the Aetolians to accept his terms in 206 BC. The following year (205 BC) he was able to conclude the Peace of Phoenice with Rome and its allies (Livy 29.12.14).

==Expansion in the Aegean==

Following an agreement with the Seleucid king Antiochus III to capture Egyptian-held territory from the boy king Ptolemy V (Plb. 15.20), Philip invaded their territories in Asia Minor, besieging Samos and capturing Miletus. This expansion of Macedonian influence created alarm in a number of neighbouring states, including Attalid Pergamum and Rhodes. Philip responded by ravaging Attalid territory and destroying the temples outside the walls of Pergamon (Didodorus XXVIII 5). Their navies clashed with Philip&#x27;s off Chios and Lade (near Miletus) in 201 BC. Philip then invaded Caria. Although the Rhodians and Attalids successfully blockaded his fleet at Bargylia, they nevertheless sent an appeal to the Romans for help. At around the same time, the Romans finally defeated Carthage. Although very little in Philip&#x27;s recent actions in Thrace and Asia Minor could be said to concern the Roman Republic directly, the Senate passed a decree supporting Pergamum and Rhodes and Marcus Valerius Laevinus was sent to investigate (Livy 31.3). Simultaneously, Philip&#x27;s relationship with Athens suddenly deteriorated. The Acarnanian League launched a raid on Attica, aided by troops which they had received from Philip V. Attalus I and Rhodes convinced the Athenians to declare war on Macedon and Philip dispatched a force of 2,000 infantry and 200 cavalry under the command of Philokles to invade Attica and place the city of Athens under siege (Livy 31.14-16).

==Second Macedonian War==
In light of reports from Laevinus and further embassies from Pergamon, Rhodes, and Athens, Publius Sulpicius Galba one of the consuls for 200 BC was tasked with resolving the troubles in Macedonia. He organised a formal declaration of war in March (Livy 31.4-8) then recruited troops, and crossed the Adriatic in autumn (Livy 31.12-14). Meanwhile, Philip was besieging Abydos in the Hellespont. During the siege of Abydos, in the autumn of 200 BC, Philip was met by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, a Roman ambassador on his way back from Egypt, who urged him not to attack any Greek state or to seize any territory belonging to Ptolemy and to go to arbitration with Rhodes and Pergamon. Philip protested that he was not in violation of any of the terms of the Peace of Phoenice, but in vain. As he returned to Macedonia after the fall of Abydos, he learnt of the landing of Sulpicius&#x27; force in Epirus.
===Campaigns against Sulpicius===
Gaius Claudius Centho was sent with 20 ships and 1,000 men to aid the Athenians, then led a surprise raid on the city of Chalcis in Euboea, one of the key Antigonid strongholds known as the &#x27;fetters of Greece&#x27;. Philip rushed to Chalcis with a force of 5,000 men and 300 cavalry. Finding that Claudius had already withdrawn, he sped on towards Athens, where he defeated the Athenian and Attalid troops in a battle outside the Dipylon Gate and encamped at Cynosarges, made a series of unsuccessful assaults on Eleusis, Piraeus, and Athens. Then he ravaged the sanctuaries throughout Attica and withdrew to Boeotia. The damage to the rural and deme sanctuaries of Attica was severe and marked the permanent end of their use.

Over the winter of 200-199 BC, the diplomatic efforts of Philip, Sulpicius, and the Athenians centred on the Aetolian League, which seemed inclined to support the Romans but remained neutral at this stage. In the spring, Sulpicius and the Dardanians separately invaded Upper Macedonia, while the Aetolian League joined the war on the Roman side and invaded Magnesia and Perrhaebia, then continued to ravage Thessaly. There, Philip suddenly appeared and completely defeated their force. He spent some time besieging the Aetolian city of Thaumaci, but gave up and withdrew as winter approached. He spent the winter training his army and engaging in diplomacy, particularly with the Achaean League.
===Campaigns against Flamininus===
Publius Villius Tappulus replaced Sulpicius in command, but spent most of the year dealing with a mutiny. In summer 198 BC Philip marched west and encamped on both sides of the Aoös river where it passed through a narrow ravine. Villius marched to meet him, but was still considering what to do when he learnt that his successor, Titus Quinctius Flamininus was on his way to Corcyra to assume command. At a peace conference, Flamininus announced the Romans&#x27; new peace terms. Up to this point, the Romans had merely ordered Philip to stop attacking the Greek cities. Now Flamininus demanded that he should make reparations to all the Greek cities he had harmed and withdraw all his garrisons from cities outside Macedonia, including Thessaly, which had been part of the Macedonian kingdom continuously since 353 BC. Philip stormed out of the meeting in anger and Flamininus decided to attack. In the subsequent Battle of the Aous, the Macedonian force collapsed and fled, suffering 2,000 casualties. Philip gathered up the survivors and retreated to Thessaly and then to Tempe.

Over the winter of 198/197 BC, Philip declared his willingness to make peace. The parties met at Nicaea in Locris in November 198 - Philip sailed from Demetrias, but he refused to disembark and meet Flamininus and his allies on the beach, so he addressed them from the prow of his ship. To prolong the proceedings, Flamininus insisted that all his allies should be present at the negotiations. He then reiterated his demands that Philip should withdraw all his garrisons from Greece, Illyria, and Asia Minor. Philip was not prepared to go this far and he was persuaded to send an embassy to the Roman Senate. When this embassy reached Rome, the Senate demanded that Philip surrender the &quot;fetters of Greece,&quot; Demetrias, Chalcis, and Corinth, but Philip&#x27;s envoys claimed they had no permission to agree to this, so the war continued. Over the rest of the winter, Philip mobilised all the manpower of his kingdom, which amounted to 18,000 men. To these he added 4,000 peltasts from Thrace and Illyria, and 2,500 mercenaries. All these forces were gathered at Dion. 

In June 197 BC, Flamininus marched north through Thermopylae, with allies from Aetolia, Gortyn, Apollonia, and Athamania. Philip marched south into Thessaly and the two armies met at the Battle of Cynoscephalae (Plb. 18.18-27; Livy 33.5-11). In what proved to be the decisive engagement of the war, the legions of Flamininus defeated Philip&#x27;s Macedonian phalanx. Philip himself fled on horseback, collected the survivors, and withdrew to Macedonia. Philip was forced to sue for peace on Roman terms.

===Peace treaty with Rome===
In 196 BC Philip V signed a peace treaty with the Romans. As per the treaty, Philip V had to relinquish his claim to all Greek cities on the mainland and Asia Minor, including the &quot;fetters&quot; of Greece - Corinth, Chalcis and Demetrias (Plb. 18.44-46). He could also no longer harvest timber on the territory under his control. This effectively meant he could not build up an arsenal of weapons, such as large naval vessels.

Following the peace treaty, Philip cooperated with the Romans and provided material support for their wars against the Spartans under Nabis in 195 BC. Philip V also supported the Romans against Antiochus III the Great and the Aetolian League. After the Roman–Seleucid War the Romans allowed Philip V to keep territory he had conquered, such as Demetrias, the Magnesian coastline of Thessaly, parts of Athamania, parts of Dolopia, parts of Perrhaebia, and a number of towns in the Malian Gulf.

==Internal reforms==

Philip V was able to generate revenue by imposing taxes on the population of Macedonia and the exploitation of royal property, including mining, forestry and agriculture. According to the Roman historian Livy, less than half of the tributum paid to Philip V was passed on to Rome after 168 BC. Following the Second Macedonian War, Philip V increased his revenues from agriculture and mines. Philip focused on consolidating power within Macedonia. He reorganised the country&#x27;s internal affairs and finances. Mines were reopened, and a new currency was minted.

==Final years==

However, Rome continued to be suspicious of Philip&#x27;s intentions. Accusations by Macedon&#x27;s neighboring states, particularly Pergamon, led to constant interference from Rome. Feeling the threat growing that Rome would invade Macedon and remove him as king, he tried to extend his influence in the Balkans by force and diplomacy. However, his efforts were undermined by the pro-Roman policy of his younger son Demetrius, who was encouraged by Rome to consider the possibility of succession ahead of his older brother, Perseus. This eventually led to a quarrel between Perseus and Demetrius which forced Philip to decide reluctantly to execute Demetrius for treason in 180 BC. This decision had a severe impact on Philip&#x27;s health and he died a year later at Amphipolis towards the end of 179 B.C.

He was succeeded by his eldest son Perseus, who ruled as the last king of Macedon.

<doc id="100083" wikidata="Q1445143" url="?curid=100083" title="Skinny Client Control Protocol">
<text>The Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP) is a proprietary network terminal control protocol originally developed by Selsius Systems, which was acquired by Cisco Systems in 1998.

SCCP is a lightweight IP-based protocol for session signaling with Cisco Unified Communications Manager, formerly named &quot;CallManager&quot;. The protocol architecture is similar to the media gateway control protocol architecture, in that is decomposes the function of media conversion in telecommunication for transmission via an Internet Protocol network into a relatively low-intelligence customer-premises device and a call agent implementation that controls the CPE via signaling commands. The call agent product is Cisco CallManager, which also performs as a signaling proxy for call events initiated over other common protocols such as H.323, and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for voice over IP, or ISDN for the public switched telephone network.

==Protocol components==
An SCCP client uses TCP/IP to communicate with one or more Call Manager applications in a cluster. It uses the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) over UDP-transport for the bearer traffic (real-time audio stream) with other Skinny clients or an H.323 terminal. SCCP is a stimulus-based protocol and is designed as a communications protocol for hardware endpoints and other embedded systems, with significant CPU and memory constraints.

Some Cisco analog media gateways, such as the VG248 gateway, register and communicate with Cisco Unified Communications Manager using SCCP.

==Origin==
Cisco acquired SCCP technology when it acquired Selsius Corporation in 1998. For this reason the protocol is also referred to in Cisco documentation as the Selsius Skinny Station Protocol. Another remnant of the origin of the Cisco IP phones is the default device name format for registered Cisco phones with CallManager. It is &quot;SEP&quot;, as in &quot;Selsius Ethernet Phone&quot;, followed by the MAC address. Cisco also has marketed a Skinny-based softphone called Cisco IP Communicator.

==Client examples==

Examples of SCCP client devices include the Cisco 7900 series of IP phones, Cisco IP Communicator softphone, and the 802.11b wireless Wireless IP Phone 7920, along with Cisco Unity voicemail server.

==Other implementations==
Other companies, such as Symbol Technologies, SocketIP, and Digium, have implemented the protocol in VoIP terminals and IP phones, media gateway controllers, and softswitches. An open source implementation of a call agent is available in the Asterisk and FreeSWITCH systems. IPBlue provides a soft phone that emulates a Cisco 7960 telephone. Twinlights Software distributes a soft phone implementation for Android-based devices. The Cisco Unified Application Environment, the product acquired by Cisco when they purchased Metreos, supports using SCCP to emulate Cisco 7960 phones allowing applications to access all Cisco line-side features.

<text>Researched and devised by Dr. Oliphant Jackson, the Jackson ratio is a method of determining whether a member of the tortoise species &quot;Testudo graeca&quot; or &quot;Testudo hermanni&quot; is maintaining its optimum bodyweight, which is necessary for a successful hibernation.

==Calculation==
The Jackson ratio is calculated by taking the weight of the tortoise in grams and dividing it by the cube of the length of the tortoise&#x27;s carapace in centimeters. This is essentially a value of the density of the tortoise in g/cm3. The optimal value for this ratio is 0.21 with a range of 0.18–0.22 being acceptable for hibernation. Values significantly less than this indicate an underweight tortoise and larger values are indicative of overweight tortoises.

The Jackson ratio is expressed as a graph of minimum and optimum weights for a given carapace length. This exhibits the same principle without the maths.

<text>Thomas Midgley Jr. (May 18, 1889 – November 2, 1944) was an American mechanical and chemical engineer. He played a major role in developing leaded gasoline (tetraethyl lead) and some of the first chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), better known in the United States by the brand name Freon; both products were later banned from common use due to their harmful impact on human health and the environment. He was granted more than 100 patents over the course of his career.

Midgley contracted polio in 1940 and was left disabled; in 1944, he was found strangled to death by a device he devised to allow him to get out of bed unassisted. It is often reported that he had been accidentally killed by his own invention, but his death was declared by the coroner to be a suicide.

While the harmful effects of CFCs were not appreciated until decades after Midgley&#x27;s death, tetraethyl lead was known to be acutely toxic by those involved in the development of leaded gasoline. This included Midgley, who publicly insisted that there was nonetheless no health hazard posed by the use of leaded gasoline in internal combustion engines.

== Early life ==
Thomas Midgley Jr. was born in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, on May 18, 1889, the son of Hattie Louise (née Emerson) (1865 – 1950) and Thomas Midgley Sr. (1840 – 1934). His family had a history of inventing; his father was an inventor in the field of automobile tires while his maternal grandfather, James Emerson, invented the inserted tooth saw. He grew up in Columbus, Ohio, and graduated from Cornell University in 1911 with a degree in mechanical engineering.

Early on, Midgley had a penchant for finding useful applications for known substances. In high school, he used the chewed bark of the slippery elm trees to give baseballs a more curved trajectory, a practice professional players would later pick up. Later in life, he was known to always carry a copy of the periodic table, his main tool in the search for the substance that would mark his breakthrough invention.

==Career==
=== Leaded gasoline ===
In 1916, Midgley began working at General Motors. In December 1921, while working under the direction of Charles Kettering at Dayton Research Laboratories, a subsidiary of General Motors, he discovered (after discarding tellurium due to the difficult-to-eradicate smell) that the addition of tetraethyllead (TEL) to gasoline prevented knocking in internal combustion engines. The company named the substance &quot;Ethyl&quot;, avoiding all mention of lead in reports and advertising. Oil companies and automobile manufacturers (especially General Motors, which owned the patent jointly filed by Kettering and Midgley) promoted the TEL additive as an inexpensive alternative superior to ethanol or ethanol-blended fuels, on which they could make very little profit. In December 1922, the American Chemical Society awarded Midgley the 1923 Nichols Medal for the &quot;Use of Anti-Knock Compounds in Motor Fuels&quot;. This was the first of several major awards he earned during his career.

In 1923, Midgley took a long vacation in Miami to cure himself of lead poisoning. He said, &quot;I find that my lungs have been affected and that it is necessary to drop all work and get a large supply of fresh air.&quot; That year, General Motors created the General Motors Chemical Company (GMCC) to supervise the production of TEL by the DuPont company. Kettering was elected as president with Midgley as vice president. However, after two deaths and several cases of lead poisoning at the TEL prototype plant in Dayton, Ohio, the staff at Dayton was said in 1924 to be &quot;depressed to the point of considering giving up the whole tetraethyl lead program&quot;. Over the course of the next year, eight more people died at DuPont&#x27;s plant in Deepwater, New Jersey. In 1924, dissatisfied with the speed of DuPont&#x27;s TEL production using the &quot;bromide process&quot;, General Motors and the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (now known as ExxonMobil) created the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation to produce and market TEL. Ethyl Corporation built a new chemical plant using a high-temperature ethyl chloride process at the Bayway Refinery in New Jersey. However, within the first two months of its operation, the new plant was plagued by more cases of lead poisoning, hallucinations, insanity, and five deaths.

The risks associated with exposure to lead have been known at least since the 2nd century BC, while efforts to limit lead&#x27;s use date back to at least the 16th century. Midgley experienced lead poisoning himself, and was warned about the risk of lead poisoning from TEL as early as 1922. Midgley well knew the hazards of lead. He investigated whether the risks, both in production and use, could be managed. Testing on the exhaust was completed, which he used to support the idea that 1 part tetraethyl lead per 1300 of gasoline could safely be used. After the initial worker exposures, controls were developed to allow the process to operate safely. Leaded gasoline use grew exponentially. The cumulative chronic impacts of environmental lead were grossly underestimated.

On October 30, 1924, Midgley participated in a press conference to demonstrate the apparent safety of TEL, in which he poured TEL over his hands, placed a bottle of the chemical under his nose, and inhaled its vapor for sixty seconds, declaring that he could do this every day without succumbing to any problems. However, the state of New Jersey ordered the Bayway plant to be closed a few days later, and Jersey Standard was forbidden to manufacture TEL again without state permission. Production was restarted in 1926 after intervention by the federal government. High-octane fuel, enabled by lead, was important to the military. Midgley later took a leave of absence from work after being diagnosed with lead poisoning. He was relieved of his position as vice president of GMCC in April 1925, reportedly due to his inexperience in organizational matters, but he remained an employee of General Motors.

===Freon ===
In the late 1920s, air conditioning and refrigeration systems employed compounds such as ammonia (NH3), chloromethane (CH3Cl), propane, methyl formate (C2H4O2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) as refrigerants. Though effective, these were toxic, flammable or explosive. The Frigidaire division of General Motors, at that time a leading manufacturer of such systems, sought a non-toxic, non-flammable alternative to these refrigerants.

Midgley, working with Albert Leon Henne, soon narrowed his focus to alkyl halides (the combination of carbon chains and halogens), which were known to be highly volatile (a requirement for a refrigerant) and also chemically inert. They eventually settled on the concept of incorporating fluorine into a hydrocarbon. They rejected the assumption that such compounds would be toxic, believing that the stability of the carbon–fluorine bond would be sufficient to prevent the release of hydrogen fluoride or other potential breakdown products. The team eventually synthesized dichlorodifluoromethane, the first chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), which they named &quot;Freon&quot;. This compound is more commonly referred to today as &quot;Freon 12&quot;, or &quot;R12&quot;.

Freon and other CFCs soon largely replaced other refrigerants, but also had other applications. A notable example was their use as a propellant in aerosol products and asthma inhalers. The Society of Chemical Industry awarded Midgley the Perkin Medal in 1937 for this work. In 1941, the American Chemical Society gave Midgley its highest award, the Priestley Medal. This was followed by the Willard Gibbs Award in 1942. He also held two honorary degrees and was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. In 1944, he was elected president and chairman of the American Chemical Society.

== Death ==
In 1940, at the age of 51, Midgley contracted polio and was left severely disabled. He devised an elaborate system of ropes and pulleys to lift himself out of bed. On November 2, 1944, at the age of 55, he was found dead at his home in Worthington, Ohio. He had been killed by his own device after he became entangled in it and died of strangulation. His death was ruled a suicide by the coroner.
He left behind a widow, Carrie M. Reynolds from Delaware, Ohio, whom he had married on August 3, 1911. 

== Legacy ==
Midgley&#x27;s legacy is tied in with the negative environmental impact of leaded gasoline and freon. Environmental historian J. R. McNeill opined that Midgley &quot;had more adverse impact on the atmosphere than any other single organism in Earth&#x27;s history&quot;, and Bill Bryson remarked that Midgley possessed &quot;an instinct for the regrettable that was almost uncanny&quot;. Fred Pearce, writing for &quot;New Scientist&quot;, described Midgley as a &quot;one-man environmental disaster&quot;.

Use of leaded gasoline, which he invented, released large quantities of lead into the atmosphere all over the world. High atmospheric lead levels have been linked with serious long-term health problems from childhood, including neurological impairment, and with increased levels of violence and criminality in America and around the world. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included both leaded gasoline and CFCs on its list of &quot;The 50 Worst Inventions&quot;.

Midgley died three decades before the ozone-depleting and greenhouse gas effects of CFCs in the atmosphere became widely known. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol phased out the use of CFCs like Freon.

The harm of leaded gasoline and chlorofluorocarbons have been framed as lessons in known unknowns and unknown unknowns, respectively. When leaded gasoline was invented it was known that lead had harmful effects on human health in large quantities, and that leaded gasoline caused emissions of trace amounts of lead to the atmosphere, but it was not known whether those trace amounts had adverse effects. The existence of the ozone layer, however, and the potential for chlorofluorocarbons to harm it, was not known at the time.

In 2024, it was announced that Terence Winter – writer of 2013&#x27;s &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; – has co-written a feature film about Midgley entitled &quot;Midge&quot;.

<text>Nature conservation is the moral philosophy and conservation movement focused on protecting species from extinction, maintaining and restoring habitats, enhancing ecosystem services, and protecting biological diversity. A range of values underlie conservation, which can be guided by biocentrism, anthropocentrism, ecocentrism, and sentientism, environmental ideologies that inform ecocultural practices and identities. There has recently been a movement towards evidence-based conservation which calls for greater use of scientific evidence to improve the effectiveness of conservation efforts. As of 2018 15% of land and 7.3% of the oceans were protected. Many environmentalists set a target of protecting 30% of land and marine territory by 2030. In 2021, 16.64% of land and 7.9% of the oceans were protected. The 2022 IPCC report on climate impacts and adaptation, underlines the need to conserve 30% to 50% of the Earth&#x27;s land, freshwater and ocean areas – echoing the 30% goal of the U.N.&#x27;s Convention on Biodiversity.

== Introduction ==
Conservation goals include conserving habitat, preventing deforestation, maintaining soil organic matter, halting species extinction, reducing overfishing, and mitigating climate change. Different philosophical outlooks guide conservationists towards these different goals.

The principal value underlying many expressions of the conservation ethic is that the natural world has intrinsic and intangible worth along with utilitarian value – a view carried forward by parts of the scientific conservation movement and some of the older Romantic schools of the ecology movement. Philosophers have attached intrinsic value to different aspects of nature, whether this is individual organisms (biocentrism) or ecological wholes such as species or ecosystems (ecoholism).

More utilitarian schools of conservation have an anthropocentric outlook and seek a proper valuation of local and global impacts of human activity upon nature in their effect upon human wellbeing, now and to posterity. How such values are assessed and exchanged among people determines the social, political and personal restraints and imperatives by which conservation is practiced. This is a view common in the modern environmental movement. There is increasing interest in extending the responsibility for human wellbeing to include the welfare of sentient animals. In 2022 the United Kingdom introduced the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act which lists all vertebrates, decapod crustaceans and cephalopods as sentient beings. Branches of conservation ethics focusing on sentient individuals include ecofeminism and compassionate conservation.

In the United States of America, the year 1864 saw the publication of two books which laid the foundation for Romantic and Utilitarian conservation traditions in America. The posthumous publication of Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Walden&quot; established the grandeur of unspoiled nature as a citadel to nourish the spirit of man. A very different book from George Perkins Marsh, &quot;Man and Nature&quot;, later subtitled &quot;The Earth as Modified by Human Action&quot;, catalogued his observations of man exhausting and altering the land from which his sustenance derives.

The consumer conservation ethic has been defined as the attitudes and behaviors held and engaged in by individuals and families that ultimately serve to reduce overall societal consumption of energy. The conservation movement has emerged from the advancements of moral reasoning. Increasing numbers of philosophers and scientists have made its maturation possible by considering the relationships between human beings and organisms with the same rigor. This social ethic primarily relates to local purchasing, moral purchasing, the sustained, and efficient use of renewable resources, the moderation of destructive use of finite resources, and the prevention of harm to common resources such as air and water quality, the natural functions of a living earth, and cultural values in a built environment. These practices are used to slow down the accelerating rate in which extinction is occurring at. The origins of this ethic can be traced back to many different philosophical and religious beliefs; that is, these practices has been advocated for centuries. In the past, conservationism has been categorized under a spectrum of views, including anthropocentric, utilitarian conservationism, and radical eco-centric green eco-political views.

More recently, the three major movements has been grouped to become what we now know as conservation ethic. The person credited with formulating the conservation ethic in the United States is former president, Theodore Roosevelt.

== Terminology ==

The term &quot;conservation&quot; was coined by Gifford Pinchot in 1907. He told his close friend United States President Theodore Roosevelt who used it for a national conference of governors in 1908.

In common usage, the term refers to the activity of systematically protecting natural resources such as forests, including biological diversity. Carl F. Jordan defines biological conservation as:

While this usage is not new, the idea of biological conservation has been applied to the principles of ecology, biogeography, anthropology, economy, and sociology to maintain biodiversity.

The term &quot;conservation&quot; itself may cover the concepts such as cultural diversity, genetic diversity, and the concept of movements environmental conservation, seedbank curation (preservation of seeds), and gene bank coordination (preservation of animals&#x27; genetic material). These are often summarized as the priority to respect diversity.

Much recent movement in conservation can be considered a resistance to commercialism and globalization. Slow Food is a consequence of rejecting these as moral priorities, and embracing a slower and more locally focused lifestyle.

Sustainable living is a lifestyle that people are beginning to adopt, promoting to make decisions that would help protect biodiversity. The small lifestyle changes that promote sustainability will eventually accumulate into the proliferation of biological diversity. Regulating the ecolabeling of products from fisheries, controlling for sustainable food production, or keeping the lights off during the day are some examples of sustainable living. However, sustainable living is not a simple and uncomplicated approach. A 1987 Brundtland Report expounds on the notion of sustainability as a process of change that looks different for everyone: &quot;It is not a fixed state of harmony, but rather a process of change in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of investments, the orientation of technological development, and institutional change are made consistent with future as well as present needs. We do not pretend that the process is easy or straightforward.&quot; Simply put, sustainable living does make a difference by compiling many individual actions that encourage the protection of biological diversity.

== Practice ==

Distinct trends exist regarding conservation development. The need for conserving land has only recently intensified during what some scholars refer to as the Capitalocene epoch. This era marks the beginning of colonialism, globalization, and the Industrial Revolution that has led to global land change as well as climate change.

While many countries&#x27; efforts to preserve species and their habitats have been government-led, those in the North Western Europe tended to arise out of the middle-class and aristocratic interest in natural history, expressed at the level of the individual and the national, regional or local learned society. Thus countries like Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, etc. had what would be called non-governmental organizations – in the shape of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, National Trust and County Naturalists&#x27; Trusts (dating back to 1889, 1895, and 1912 respectively) Natuurmonumenten, Provincial Conservation Trusts for each Dutch province, Vogelbescherming, etc. – a long time before there were national parks and national nature reserves. This in part reflects the absence of wilderness areas in heavily cultivated Europe, as well as a longstanding interest in laissez-faire government in some countries, like the UK, leaving it as no coincidence that John Muir, the Scottish-born founder of the National Park movement (and hence of government-sponsored conservation) did his sterling work in the US, where he was the motor force behind the establishment of such national parks as Yosemite and Yellowstone. Nowadays, officially more than 10 percent of the world is legally protected in some way or the other, and in practice, private fundraising is insufficient to pay for the effective management of so much land with protective status.

Protected areas in developing countries, where probably as many as 70–80 percent of the species of the world live, still enjoy very little effective management and protection. Some countries, such as Mexico, have non-profit civil organizations and landowners dedicated to protecting vast private property, such is the case of Hacienda Chichen&#x27;s Maya Jungle Reserve and Bird Refuge in Chichen Itza, Yucatán. The Adopt A Ranger Foundation has calculated that worldwide about 140,000 rangers are needed for the protected areas in developing and transition countries. There are no data on how many rangers are employed at the moment, but probably less than half the protected areas in developing and transition countries have any rangers at all and those that have them are at least 50% short. This means that there would be a worldwide ranger deficit of 105,000 rangers in the developing and transition countries.

The terms &quot;conservation&quot; and &quot;preservation&quot; are frequently conflated outside the academic, scientific, and professional kinds of literature. The United States&#x27; National Park Service offers the following explanation of the important ways in which these two terms represent very different conceptions of environmental protection ethics:

During the environmental movement of the early 20th century, two opposing factions emerged: conservationists and preservationists. Conservationists sought to regulate human use while preservationists sought to eliminate human impact altogether.&quot;

C. Anne Claus presents a distinction for conservation practices. Claus divides conservation into conservation-far and conservation-near. Conservation-far is the means of protecting nature by separating it and safeguarding it from humans. Means of doing this include the creation of preserves or national parks. They are meant to keep the flora and fauna away from human influence and have become a staple method in the west. Conservation-near however is conservation via connection. The method of reconnecting people to nature through traditions and beliefs to foster a desire to protect nature. The basis is that instead of forcing compliance to separate from nature onto the people, instead conservationists work with locals and their traditions to find conservation efforts that work for all. 

===Evidence-based conservation ===

Evidence-based conservation is the application of evidence in conservation management actions and policy making. It is defined as systematically assessing scientific information from published, peer-reviewed publications and texts, practitioners&#x27; experiences, independent expert assessment, and local and indigenous knowledge on a specific conservation topic. This includes assessing the current effectiveness of different management interventions, threats and emerging problems, and economic factors.

Evidence-based conservation was organized based on the observations that decision making in conservation was based on intuition and/or practitioner experience often disregarding other forms of evidence of successes and failures (e.g. scientific information). This has led to costly and poor outcomes. Evidence-based conservation provides access to information that will support decision making through an evidence-based framework of &quot;what works&quot; in conservation.

The evidence-based approach to conservation is based on evidence-based practice which started in medicine and later spread to nursing, education, psychology, and other fields. It is part of the larger movement towards evidence-based practices.

<doc id="100090" wikidata="Q314447" url="?curid=100090" title="Hypereides">
<text>Hypereides or Hyperides (, &quot;Hypereidēs&quot;; c. 390 – 322 BC; English pronunciation with the stress variably on the penultimate or antepenultimate syllable) was an Athenian logographer (speech writer). He was one of the ten Attic orators included in the &quot;Alexandrian canon&quot; compiled by Aristophanes of Byzantium and Aristarchus of Samothrace in the third century BC.

He was a leader of the Athenian resistance to King Philip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great. He was associated with Lycurgus and Demosthenes in exposing pro-Macedonian sympathizers. He is known for prosecuting Philippides of Paiania for his pro-Macedonian measures and his decree in honoring Alexander the Great.

== Rise to power ==
Little is known about his early life except that he was the son of Glaucippus of the deme of Collytus and that he studied logography under Isocrates. In 360 BC, he prosecuted Autocles for treason. During the Social War (358–355 BC) he accused Aristophon, then one of the most influential men at Athens, of malpractices, and impeached Philocrates (343 BC) for high treason. Although Hypereides supported Demosthenes in the struggle against Philip II of Macedon; that support was withdrawn after the Harpalus affair. After Demosthenes&#x27; exile Hypereides became the head of the patriotic party (324 BC).

== Downfall ==
After the death of Alexander the Great, Hypereides was one of the chief promoters of war against Macedonian rule. His speeches are believed to have led to the outbreak of the Lamian War (323–322 BC) in which Athens, Aetolia, and Thessaly revolted against Macedonian rule. After the decisive defeat at Crannon (322 BC) in which Athens and her allies lost their independence, Hypereides and the other orators were captured by Archias of Thurii and condemned to death by the Athenian supporters of Macedon.

Hypereides fled to Aegina only to be captured at the temple of Poseidon. After being put to death, his body (according to others) was taken to Cleonae and shown to the Macedonian general Antipater before being returned to Athens for burial.

== Personality and oratorical style ==
Hypereides was an ardent pursuer of &quot;the beautiful,&quot; which in his time generally meant pleasure and luxury. He was a flamboyant figure, unwavering in public in his hostility to Macedon. He was a well-known epicure given to fine food and women. He engaged in countless affairs with prostitutes, some of whom he defended in court. His temper was easy-going and humorous. Though in his development of the periodic sentence he followed Isocrates, the essential tendencies of his style are those of Lysias. His diction was plain, though he occasionally indulged in long compound words probably borrowed from Middle Comedy. His composition was simple. He was especially distinguished for subtlety of expression, grace and wit. Hypereides is known to have owned at least two or three pieces of property: an estate in Eleusis, a house in Athens, and a house in Piraeus, where he kept one of his many women. In around 340 B.C. he is known to have performed only two public services, as trierarch and Chorus producer. It is said he had received money from the Persian King who was alarmed at Macedon&#x27;s expansion.

== Surviving speeches ==

Hypereides&#x27;s speech in trial against Philippides lasted over thirty minutes. In the first speech against Philippides he attacked King Philip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great. In the second part of the papyrus, he attacks Philippides and his associates and states: Each one of them was a traitor, one in Thebes, another in Tangara, another in Eleutherae, doing everything in the service of the Macedonians. He pleaded Philip&#x27;s cause and campaigned with him against our country which is his most serious offense. Hypereides detested Philippides pro-Macedonian sympathies. Hypereides exposed Philippides who was known as saying in the Assembly: We must honor Alexander for all those that died at his hand. 
Seventy-seven speeches have been attributed to Hypereides, of which twenty-five were regarded as spurious by his contemporaries. It is said that a manuscript of most of the speeches survived as late as the 15th century in the Bibliotheca Corviniana, library of Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary, but was later destroyed after the capture of Buda by the Turks in the 16th century. Only a few fragments were known until relatively recent times. In 1847, large fragments of his speeches, &quot;Against Demosthenes&quot; and &quot;For Lycophron&quot; (incidentally interesting for clarifying the order of marriage processions and other details of Athenian life, and the Athenian government of Lemnos) and the whole of &quot;For Euxenippus&quot; (c. 330 BC, a &quot;locus classicus&quot; on εἰσαγγελίαι &quot;eisangeliai&quot; or state prosecutions), were found in a tomb at Thebes in Egypt. In 1856 a considerable portion of a &quot;logos epitaphios&quot;, a &quot;Funeral Oration&quot; over Leosthenes and his comrades who had fallen in the Lamian war was discovered.

Towards the end of the nineteenth century further discoveries were made including the conclusion of the speech &quot;Against Philippides&quot; (dealing with an indictment for the proposal of unconstitutional measure, arising out of the disputes of the Macedonian and anti-Macedonian parties at Athens), and of the whole of &quot;Against Athenogenes&quot; (a perfumer accused of fraud in the sale of his business).

=== New discoveries ===
In 2002 Natalie Tchernetska of Trinity College, Cambridge discovered fragments of two speeches of Hypereides, which had been considered lost, in the &quot;Archimedes Palimpsest.&quot; These were from two new speeches, the &quot;Against Timander&quot; and &quot;Against Diondas&quot;, increasing the quantity of material known by this author by 20 percent. Tchernetska&#x27;s discovery led to a publication on the subject in the &quot;Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik&quot;. This prompted the establishment of a working group under the auspices of the British Academy, which includes scholars from the UK, Hungary and the US.

In 2006, the &quot;Archimedes Palimpsest&quot; project together with imagers at Stanford University used powerful X-ray fluorescence imaging to read the final pages of the &quot;Palimpsest,&quot; which contained the material by Hypereides. These were interpreted, transcribed and translated by the working group.

In 2018 a passage of another speech of Hypereides (&quot;Against the envoys of Antipater&quot;) was discovered in a papyrus from Herculaneum.

== Lost speeches ==

Among the speeches not yet recovered is the &quot;Deliacus&quot; in which the presidency of the Temple of the Delians claimed by both Athens and Cos, which was adjudged by the Amphictyonic League to Athens. Also missing is the speech in which he defended the illustrious courtesan Phryne (said to have been his mistress) on a capital charge: according to Plutarch and Athenaeus the speech climaxed with Hypereides stripping off her clothing to reveal her naked breasts; in the face of which the judges found it impossible to condemn her.

== Portraits ==
Portraits of Hypereides are known to have existed in antiquity: a papyrus fragment from Egypt records that the Athenians honored him with statues after their liberation from Demetrius of Phalerum in 307 BCE, and an inscribed base, once in the Villa Mattei in Rome but now lost, bore a statue of Hyperides signed by the artist Zeuxiades. No inscribed portrait of Hypereides survives, however, and no existing ancient portrait type can be securely identified with him. In 1913, Frederik Poulsen suggested that a double herm of the Roman period in the Musée Vivenel in Compiègne, which bears a portrait of a bearded man on one side and a portrait of a woman on the other, represented Hypereides and Phryne; as a result, the male portrait type, which exists in at least half a dozen Roman versions, is now commonly referred to as Hypereides. The style of the portrait that lies behind these copies seems to fit the late 4th or early 3rd century BCE. Poulsen&#x27;s argument has not been universally accepted, however, and critics have described it as &quot;dubious&quot; and &quot;speculative&quot;.

==Assessment==
William Noel, the curator of manuscripts and rare books at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland and the director of the &quot;Archimedes Palimpsest&quot; project, called Hypereides &quot;one of the great foundational figures of Greek democracy and the golden age of Athenian democracy, the foundational democracy of all democracy.&quot;

<doc id="100091" wikidata="Q1004412" url="?curid=100091" title="Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists">
<text>The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is a nonprofit organization concerning science and global security issues resulting from accelerating technological advances that have negative consequences for humanity. The &quot;Bulletin&quot; publishes content at both a free-access website and a bi-monthly, nontechnical academic journal. The organization has been publishing continuously since 1945, when it was founded by Albert Einstein and former Manhattan Project scientists as the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists of Chicago&quot; immediately following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The organization is also the keeper of the symbolic Doomsday Clock, the time of which is announced each January.

== Background ==
One of the driving forces behind the creation of the &quot;Bulletin&quot; was the amount of public interest surrounding atomic energy and rapid technological change at the dawn of the Atomic Age. In 1945 the public interest in atomic warfare and weaponry inspired contributors to the &quot;Bulletin&quot; to attempt to inform those interested about the dangers of the nuclear arms race they knew was coming and about the destruction that atomic war could bring about. To convey the particular peril posed by nuclear weapons, the &quot;Bulletin&quot; devised the Doomsday Clock in 1947, with an original setting of seven minutes to midnight.

The minute hand of the Clock first moved closer to midnight in response to changing world events in 1949, following the first Soviet nuclear test. The Clock has been set forward and back over the years as circumstances have changed; , it is set at 89 seconds to midnight. The Doomsday Clock is used to represent threats to humanity from a variety of sources: nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, climate change, and disruptive technologies. 
In 2015, the &quot;Bulletin&quot; unveiled its Doomsday Dashboard, an interactive infographic that illustrates some of the data the &quot;Bulletin&quot; Science and Security Board takes into account when deciding the time of the Clock each year. As of August 2018, the &quot;Bulletin&quot; Board of Sponsors boasts 14 Nobel Laureates.

In the 1950s, the &quot;Bulletin&quot; was involved in the formation of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, annual conferences of scientists concerned about nuclear proliferation, and, more broadly, the role of science in modern society.

==History==
The &quot;Bulletin&quot; was founded in late 1945 by &quot;scientific men who helped make the A-bomb&quot;. The founder and first editor of the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; was biophysicist Eugene Rabinowitch (1901–1973). He founded the magazine with physicist Hyman Goldsmith. Rabinowitch was a professor of botany and biophysics at the University of Illinois and was also a founding member of the Continuing Committee for the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs. In addition to Rabinowitch and Goldsmith, contributors have included: Morton Grodzins, Hans Bethe, Anatoli Blagonravov, Max Born, Harrison Brown, Stuart Chase, Brock Chisholm, E.U. Condon, Albert Einstein, E.K. Fedorov, Bernard T. Feld, James Franck, Ralph E. Lapp, Richard S. Leghorn, J. Robert Oppenheimer (first chairman of the board of the organization), Lord Boyd Orr, Michael Polanyi, Louis Ridenour, Bertrand Russell, Nikolay Semyonov, Leó Szilárd, Edward Teller, , Harold C. Urey, Paul Weiss, James L. Tuck, among many others.

In 1949, the Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science incorporated as a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization to serve as the parent organization and fundraising mechanism of the &quot;Bulletin&quot;. In 2003, the board of directors voted to change the foundation&#x27;s name to Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

==Purpose==
The &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; began as an emergency action undertaken by scientists who saw urgent need for an immediate educational program about atomic weapons. The intention was to educate fellow scientists about the relationship between their world of science and the world of national and international politics. A second was to help the American people understand what nuclear energy and its possible applications to war meant. The &quot;Bulletin&quot; contributors believed the atom bomb would only be the first of many dangers. The aim of the &quot;Bulletin&quot; was to carry out the long, sustained effort of educating people about the realities of the scientific age.

The &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; seeks to educate citizens, policy makers, scientists, and journalists by providing non-technical, scientifically sound and policy-relevant information about nuclear weapons, climate change, and other global security issues. The &quot;Bulletin&quot; also serves as a reliable, high-quality global forum for diverse international opinions on the best means of reducing reliance on nuclear weapons. Since its inception in 1945, the &quot;Bulletin&quot; has sought to educate the American public of the continual danger posed by nuclear weapons and other global dangers, most recently adding climate change and disruptive technologies in the life sciences to the list of concerns.

The &quot;Bulletin&quot; leadership consists of three boards, and it was announced on October 25, 2018, that California Governor Jerry Brown is joining the organization as executive chair.

===Board of Sponsors===
The &quot;Bulletin&quot; Board of Sponsors is composed of accomplished science and security leaders from around the world. Members of the Board of Sponsors weigh in on critical issues, including the setting of the organization&#x27;s Doomsday Clock. As of October 2018, the &quot;Bulletin&quot; Board of Sponsors lists 14 Nobel Laureates.

===Science and Security Board===
The &quot;Bulletin&quot; Science and Security Board is composed of globally-recognized leaders who have specific areas of expertise in nuclear risk, climate change, and disruptive technologies. Members of the Science and Security Board provide the &quot;Bulletin&quot; organization and editorial staff with perspectives on trends and issues in their respective fields. Among their duties is the annual setting of the Doomsday Clock, with input from the Board of Sponsors.

==Doomsday Clock==
Once the Soviet Union developed atomic weapons, the concern surrounding the world&#x27;s destruction was a great fear of the scientists working on the &quot;Bulletin.&quot; The proximity of nuclear devastation was a popular interest and, as a result, &quot;Bulletin&quot; co-editor Hyman Goldsmith asked landscape artist Martyl Langsdorf to create a cover for the June 1947 magazine. Langsdorf, who was married to Manhattan Project physicist Alexander Langsdorf, first considered using the symbol for uranium but then realized that a clock would better convey &quot;a sense of urgency.&quot; The resultant Doomsday Clock, which only has bullets labeling the numbers in the upper left hand corner, has been featured on the cover of the &quot;Bulletin&quot; many times since its creation.

The proximity of the minute hand to midnight has been the &quot;Bulletin&quot; leadership&#x27;s way of warning the public about manmade threats to humanity; the Clock is a metaphor, not a prediction. That is, the time on the clock is not to be interpreted as actual time. When it began in 1947, the minute hand was 7 minutes to midnight; in 1953, when the Soviet Union continued to test more and more nuclear devices, it was 2 minutes to midnight. This proximity to midnight of the Doomsday Clock during the early 1950s shows the concern that the &quot;Bulletin&quot; contributors had about the Soviet Union and the nuclear arms race. The warnings of the &quot;Bulletin&quot; continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and the focus of the efforts shifted slightly from warning about the dangers of nuclear war to the necessity of disarmament. In 2007, the leadership began taking anthropogenic climate change into account in its Clock discussions. Throughout the history of the Doomsday Clock, it has moved closer to midnight, and farther away, depending upon the status of the world at that time. The Doomsday Clock has been getting closer to midnight since 1991, when it was set to 17 minutes to midnight, after the United States and the Soviet Union reached an agreement on nuclear arms reductions.

 the Doomsday Clock stands at 89 seconds to midnight. It is the closest approach to midnight, exceeding that of 1953, 2018, 2020, and 2023. The decision to move the hand of the Clock is made by the &quot;Bulletin&quot; Science and Security Board, which meets in person twice a year, with subcommittees meeting more often; the announcement of the decision is made each January. Each November, just prior to the Science and Security Board&#x27;s fall discussion, the &quot;Bulletin&quot; hosts an annual dinner and meeting in Chicago; both events are open to the public. Reflecting international events dangerous to humankind, the Clock&#x27;s hand has been adjusted 26 times since its inception in 1947, when it was initially set to seven minutes to midnight (11:53pm).

==Present==
In more recent years, articles of the &quot;Bulletin&quot; have focused on many topics, ranging from the dangers of radiation following the Chernobyl disaster to the impact of the fall of the Soviet Union. In the wake of the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse, other articles have focused on issues such as military spending and the continued funding of missile defense systems designed to thwart nuclear attacks but that in reality may not work. With the ever-growing number of nuclear power plants and the demand for nuclear energy as a solution to climate change, the publication has focused a great deal on the costs and problems surrounding nuclear energy. In 2015, the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; unveiled the Nuclear Fuel Cost Calculator.

Although the arms race and the Cold War, which were focuses of the &quot;Bulletin&quot; for many of the earlier years, are no longer occurring, the publication still focuses on the nuclear dangers that exist in the world today. As more countries such as Pakistan and India have tested nuclear weapons, the &quot;Bulletin&quot; has focused on the dangers posed by these countries. The &quot;Bulletin&quot; bi-monthly &quot;Nuclear Notebook&quot; is written by Federation of American Scientists experts Hans Kristensen and Matt Korda and tracks the number of nuclear weapons in the world by country. Robert &quot;Stan&quot; Norris, who was a founding co-author of the Nuclear Notebook, retired from the Notebook in 2018, although he is still a senior fellow at FAS. In 2015, the &quot;Bulletin&quot; added the Nuclear Notebook Interactive, an infographic that illustrates which countries have nuclear weapons and when they got them, and how many nuclear warheads they have in any given year. All nine nuclear-armed states are featured: the United States, Russia, China, India, Pakistan, France, Britain, Israel, and North Korea.

In the 21st century, articles have covered threats to humanity from a variety of sources. The potential dangers of nuclear weapons and energy, military and political developments in the Post-Cold War world, political unrest in the Middle East (and its attendant potential for proliferation risks of nuclear and chemical weapons), myriad negative consequences of climate change, cyber warfare, and changes wrought by emerging technologies have all been examined in the &quot;Bulletin&quot; in the most recent years. Examples include North Korea, Middle East, Syria, Fukushima, Cybersecurity, and Climate Change.

In January 2015, longtime executive director and publisher Kennette Benedict retired. Rachel Bronson took over as president and CEO of the organization. The editor of the &quot;Bulletin&quot; is John Mecklin.

==Next Generation Initiative==
As part of the &quot;Bulletin&quot; work to engage new audiences in issues related to nuclear threats, climate change, artificial intelligence, and biological threats, the publication launched its Next Generation Initiative to encourage young and emerging scholars to engage on these issues. Programs under the initiative have included writing workshops for graduate and undergraduate students, as well as the Voices of Tomorrow feature, which publishes articles and multimedia projects from emerging scholars and experts working in the &quot;Bulletin&quot; interest areas. Two Voices of Tomorrow authors, Emma Bastin and Yangyang Cheng, had their work republished in &quot;Teen Vogue.&quot;

The capstone of the initiative is the Leonard M. Rieser Award, selected each December by the &quot;Bulletin″&quot;s editorial team from among the year&#x27;s Voices of Tomorrow submissions. The recipient of the Rieser Award receives $1,000 and a subscription to the &quot;Bulletin″&quot;s bi-monthly magazine. In 2018, Erin Connolly and Kate Hewitt shared the award for their article &quot;American students aren&#x27;t taught nuclear weapons policy in school. Here&#x27;s how to fix that problem.&quot; Recent recipients include Yangyang Cheng, Nikita Perumal and Moritz Kütt.

== Online editions ==
The &quot;Bulletin&quot; has had a public-access website available online for some years, with a subscription magazine that comes out 6 times per year and is currently published by Taylor &amp; Francis Online. An e-newsletter is also available without charge by signing up via the &quot;Bulletin&quot; website.

Backfiles of the subscription magazine are available in the John A. Simpson Collection. The backfile from the first (1945) issue through the November 1998 issue of the &quot;Bulletin&quot; has also been made available free of charge via Google Books.

November/December 2008 was the last print edition of the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, which became all-digital only that year. SAGE Publications began publishing the &quot;Bulletin&quot; subscription magazine in September 2010; Taylor &amp; Francis took over from Sage in January 2016.

== Indexing ==
The journal is indexed in the &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, which states that the journal has a 2016 impact factor of 0.452, ranking it 71st out of 83 journals in the category &quot;International Relations&quot; and 32nd out of 41 journals in the category &quot;Social Issues&quot;.

<doc id="100094" wikidata="Q149062" url="?curid=100094" title="Morton Peto">
<text>Sir Samuel Morton Peto, 1st Baronet (4 August 1809 – 13 November 1889) was an English entrepreneur, civil engineer and railway developer, and, for more than 20 years, a Member of Parliament (MP). A partner in the firm of Grissell and Peto, he managed construction firms that built many of London&#x27;s major buildings and monuments, including the Reform Club, The Lyceum Theatre, Nelson&#x27;s Column and the replacement Houses of Parliament - commissions which brought him great wealth. The scale of his operations, and that of the workforce needed to undertake them, made him the world&#x27;s largest employer.

As a partner in Peto and Betts, he then became one of the major contractors in the building of the rapidly expanding railways of the time. Along with a small group of other Master Builders in London he is credited as a founding member of the Chartered Institute of Building in 1834.

==Early life==
Samuel Morton Peto, normally called Morton Peto, was born on 4 August 1809, in Woking, Surrey. As a youth, he was apprenticed as a bricklayer to his uncle Henry Peto, who ran a building firm in London.

==Career==
When his uncle died in 1830, Peto and his older cousin, Thomas Grissell (who had been a partner to his uncle for five years), went into partnership. The firm of Grissell and Peto (1830–1847) built many well-known buildings in London, including the Reform Club, the Oxford &amp; Cambridge Club, the Lyceum, St James&#x27;s Theatre and Hungerford Market at Charing Cross. In addition, they built Nelson&#x27;s Column the new Houses of Parliament (1843) and the vast infrastructure project of the London brick sewer.

Another project, in 1848, was the Bloomsbury Baptist Chapel, the first Baptist church with spires in London. Tradition has it that the Crown Commissioner was reluctant to lease the land to nonconformists because of their &quot;dull, spire-less architecture&quot;. Peto is said to have exclaimed, &quot;A spire, my Lord? We shall have two!&quot; The church had twin spires until 1951, when they were removed as unsafe.

==Railway works==
In 1834 Peto saw the potential of the newly developing railways and dissolved the connection with his uncle&#x27;s building firm. He and his cousin Grissell founded a business as an independent railway contractor. His firm&#x27;s first railway work was to build two stations in Curzon Street, Birmingham. Next, the firm built its first line of track, the Hanwell and Langley section of the Great Western Railway, which included the Wharncliffe Viaduct.

Grissell became increasingly nervous about the risks taken by Peto, and in 1846 dissolved the partnership.

==Peto and Betts==

In 1848 Peto and Edward Betts (who had married Peto&#x27;s sister Ann) entered into a formal partnership and together they were to work on a large number of railway contracts. Frequently, they also work in partnership with Thomas Brassey.

In 1854 during the Crimean War Peto, Betts and Brassey constructed the Grand Crimean Central Railway between Balaklava and Sevastopol to transport supplies to the troops at the front line.

In February 1855 the British government recognised Peto for his wartime services; he was made Baronet of Somerleyton Hall in the County of Suffolk. King Frederick VII of Denmark honoured Peto for establishing the Flensburg–Husum–Tönning Railway Company and its construction of railways in the Duchy of Schleswig, which led to a growing export/import trade with the port of Lowestoft. Another project abroad was the Homburg Railway built from 1859 to 1860.

The Peto and Betts partnership became insolvent in 1866 due to a combination of the failure of the bank, Overend, Gurney and Company, and their involvement in the failure of the London Chatham and Dover Railway.

==Other activities==
In 1844, Peto bought Somerleyton Hall in Suffolk. He rebuilt the hall with contemporary amenities, as well as constructing a school and more houses in the village. He next built similar projects in Lowestoft. 

In 1846, Peto became co-treasurer of the Baptist Missionary Society. From 1855 to March 1867, he was sole treasurer, resigning after personal financial difficulties. In 1855 took over the lease of The Diorama, Regent&#x27;s Park and paid for its conversion into a Baptist Chapel.

Peto served for two decades as a Member of Parliament. He was elected a Liberal Member for Norwich in 1847 to 1854, for Finsbury from 1859 to 1865, and for Bristol from 1865 to 1868. During this time he was one of the most prominent figures in public life. He helped to make a guarantee towards the financing of The Great Exhibition of 1851, backing Joseph Paxton&#x27;s Crystal Palace.

In 1855 Peto was made a baronet; but in the 1860s his businesses ran into trouble, so that in 1863 he sold Somerlyton Hall and in 1866 became bankrupt.

After his involvement with the insolvency of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway in 1866, and the failure of the Peto and Betts partnership, Peto&#x27;s personal reputation as a trustworthy businessman was badly damaged and never fully recovered.

Between 1863-65 the current Embassy of Nepal in Kensington Place Gardens, London W8, designed by the architect James Murray, was built for Peto.

In 1865 he is listed as living at Auchline House at Killin in Perthshire.

In 1868, he had to give up his seat in Parliament, despite having the support of both Benjamin Disraeli and William Ewart Gladstone. He exiled himself to Budapest and tried to promote railways in Russia and Hungary.

When he returned he became the main contractor for the Cornwall Minerals Railway which opened in 1874, but the failure of the related Cornish Consolidated Iron Mines Corporation meant that he sustained heavy losses when iron ore traffic on the CMR failed to live up to expectations. The CMR itself survived and began to recover after it had introduced passenger services in 1876 and was then leased by the Great Western Railway in 1877, but this improvement came too late for Peto.

He died in obscurity in 1889.

==Legacy==

An extremely unfavourable portrait of Peto is included in the appendix to George Borrow&#x27;s &quot;Romany Rye&quot;, where he is described as &quot;Mr. Flamson&quot;. When Peto promoted the Lowestoft Railway and Harbour Company in the 1840s, the railway split Borrow&#x27;s estate at Oulton Broad, just outside Lowestoft. Borrow deeply resented this and bore a grudge against Peto thereafter.

Peto is commemorated by a portrait bust at Norwich railway station by John Pooler. Morton Peto Road, a road in Great Yarmouth, was named after him. There is a road in Lowestoft called &quot;Peto Way&quot; that connects Lowestoft railway station (via Denmark Road, again in connection with Peto&#x27;s legacy in Denmark) to Normanston.

In Ashford. Kent, Samuel Peto Way is a residential road built upon the old Newtown Railway Works site and was named in his honour.

In Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, Hertfordshire, Morton Peto Road is located close to the town&#x27;s railway station.

A portrait of Peto hangs outside the library at Regent&#x27;s Park College, Oxford, in commemoration of his assistance with the college&#x27;s move from Stepney to Regent&#x27;s Park.

==Family==
In May 1831 Peto married Mary Grissell, one of the sisters of his later partner, Thomas Grissell. They had four children before Mary&#x27;s death in 1842:
# Henry (1840–1938) who succeeded as the 2nd baronet in 1899
# Annie
# Sophia
# Mary, who married Penruddocke Wyndham, a grandson of Colonel Wadham Wyndham, in 1852 and had two daughters.

Peto then married Sarah Ainsworth Kelsall, the daughter of Henry Kelsall of Rochdale. Peto and Sarah had many children. Of these:
# Morton Kelsall (b. 1845)
# William Herbert (b. 1849.) He was the father of Ralph Peto, maternal grandfather of John Edward Hollister Montagu, 11th Earl of Sandwich.
# Samuel Arthur (b. 1852)
# Harold Ainsworth (1854–1933), the celebrated landscape architect. (Source: Mowl, Timothy &quot;Historic Gardens of Wiltshire&quot;, London: Tempus Publishing, 2004.)
# Frank Kelsall (b. 1858)
# Basil Edward Peto (1862–1945), created a baronet in his own right in 1927. His grandson Christopher Peto, 3rd Bt. was a Conservative politician. (Source: 107th edition of Burke, &quot;Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage&quot;, London: 2004).
# Sarah
# Maude
# Edith
# Emily
# Helen Agnes, who married Lawrence Ingham Baker, son of the former Liberal MP for Frome; he was a magistrate of Somerset. They lived at Wayford Manor House at Wayford, near Crewkerne, Somerset.

<text>The oval window (or fenestra vestibuli or fenestra ovalis) is a connective tissue membrane-covered opening from the middle ear to the cochlea of the inner ear.

Vibrations that contact the tympanic membrane travel through the three ossicles and into the inner ear. The oval window is the intersection of the middle ear with the inner ear and is directly contacted by the stapes; by the time vibrations reach the oval window, they have been reduced in amplitude and increased in pressure due to the lever action of the ossicle bones. This is not an amplification function; rather, an impedance-matching function, allowing sound to be transferred from air (outer ear) to liquid (cochlea). 
It is a reniform (kidney-shaped) opening leading from the tympanic cavity into the vestibule of the inner ear; its long diameter is horizontal and its convex border is upward. It is occupied by the base of the &quot;stapes&quot;, the circumference of which is fixed by the annular ligament to the margin of the foramen.

<doc id="100096" wikidata="Q185852" url="?curid=100096" title="Edwardian era">
<text>In the United Kingdom, the Edwardian era was a period in the early 20th century that spanned the reign of King Edward VII from 1901 to 1910. It is commonly extended to the start of the First World War in 1914, during the early reign of King George V.

The era is dated from the death of Queen Victoria in January 1901, which marked the end of the Victorian era. Her son and successor, Edward VII, was already the leader of a fashionable elite that set a style influenced by the art and fashions of continental Europe. Samuel Hynes described the Edwardian era as a &quot;leisurely time when women wore picture hats and did not vote, when the rich were not ashamed to live conspicuously, and the sun never set on the British flag.&quot;

The Liberals returned to power in 1906 and made significant reforms. Below the upper class, the era was marked by significant shifts in politics among sections of society that had largely been excluded from power, such as labourers, servants, and the industrial working class. Women started (again) to play more of a role in politics.

== Perceptions ==
The Edwardian period is sometimes portrayed as a romantic golden age of long summer days and garden parties, basking in a sun that never set on the British Empire. This perception was created in the 1920s and later by those who remembered the Edwardian age with nostalgia, looking back to their childhoods across the abyss of the Great War. The Edwardian age was also seen as a mediocre period of pleasure between the great achievements of the preceding Victorian age and the catastrophe of the following war.

Recent assessments emphasise the great differences between the wealthy and the poor during this period and describe the age as heralding great changes in political and social life. Historian Lawrence James argued that the leaders felt increasingly threatened by rival powers such as Germany, Russia, and the United States. Nevertheless, the sudden arrival of World War I in the summer of 1914 was largely unexpected, except by the Royal Navy, because it had been prepared and readied for war.

==Politics ==
There was a growing political awareness among the working class, leading to a rise in trade unions, the Labour movement and demands for better working conditions. The aristocracy remained in control of top government offices.

===Conservative Party===

The Conservatives – at the time called &quot;Unionists&quot; – were the dominant political party from the 1890s until 1906. The party had many strengths, appealing to voters supportive of imperialism, tariffs, the Church of England, a powerful Royal Navy, and traditional hierarchical society. There was a powerful leadership base in the landed aristocracy and landed gentry in rural England, plus strong support from the Church of England and military interests. Historians have used election returns to demonstrate that Conservatives did surprisingly well in working-class districts. They had an appeal as well to the better-off element of traditional working-class Britons in the larger cities.

In rural areas, the national headquarters made highly effective use of paid travelling lecturers, with pamphlets, posters, and especially lantern slides, who were able to communicate effectively with rural voters – particularly the newly enfranchised agricultural workers. In the first years of the twentieth century, the Conservative government, with Arthur Balfour as Prime Minister, had numerous successes in foreign policy, defence, and education, as well as solutions for the issues of alcohol licensing and land ownership for the tenant farmers of Ireland.

Nevertheless, the weaknesses were accumulating, and proved so overwhelming in 1906 that the party did not return to complete power until 1922. The Conservative Party was losing its drive and enthusiasm, especially after the retirement of the charismatic Joseph Chamberlain. There was a bitter split on &quot;tariff reform&quot; (that is, imposing tariffs or taxes on all imports), that drove many of the free traders over to the Liberal camp. Tariff reform was a losing issue that the Conservative leadership inexplicably clung to.

Conservative support weakened among the top tier of the working-class and lower middle-class, and there was dissatisfaction among intellectuals. The 1906 general election was a landslide victory for the Liberal Party, which saw its total vote share increase by 25%, while the Conservative total vote held steady.

===Labour Party===
The Labour Party was emerging from the rapidly growing trade union movement after 1890. In 1903 it entered the Gladstone–MacDonald pact with the Liberals, allowing for cross-party support in elections, and the emergence of a small Labour contingent in Parliament. It was a temporary arrangement until the 1920s, when the Labour Party was strong enough to act on its own, and the Liberals were in an irreversible decline. Subtle social changes in the working-class were producing a younger generation that wanted to act independently.

Michael Childs argues that the younger generation had reason to prefer Labour over Liberal political styles. Social factors included secularised elementary education (with a disappearing role for Dissenting schools that inculcated Liberal viewpoints); the &quot;New Unionism&quot; after 1890 brought unskilled workers into a movement previously dominated by the skilled workers; and new leisure activities, especially the music hall and sports, involved youth while repelling the older generation of Liberal voters.

=== Liberal Party ===
The Liberal Party lacked a unified ideological base in 1906. It contained numerous contradictory and hostile factions, such as imperialists and supporters of the Boers; near-socialists and laissez-faire classical liberals; suffragettes and opponents of women&#x27;s suffrage; antiwar elements and supporters of the military alliance with France. Nonconformist Dissenters – Protestants outside the Anglican fold – were a powerful element, dedicated to opposing the established church in the fields of education and taxation. However, the Dissenters were losing support and played a lesser and lesser role in party affairs after 1900.

The party also included Roman Catholics, including the notable Catholic intellectual Hilaire Belloc, who sat as a Liberal MP between 1906 and 1910. They included secularists from the labour movement. The middle-class business, professional and intellectual communities were generally strongholds, although some old aristocratic families played important roles as well. The working-class element was moving rapidly toward the newly emerging Labour Party. One unifying element was widespread agreement on the use of politics and Parliament as a means to upgrade and improve society and to reform politics. In the House of Lords, the Liberals lost most of their members, who in the 1890s &quot;became Conservative in all but name.&quot; The government could force the unwilling king to create new Liberal peers, and that threat did prove decisive in the battle for dominance of Commons over Lords in 1911.

===Boer War===

The government entered the Second Boer War with great confidence, little expecting that the two small rural Boer republics in southern Africa with a combined White population smaller than that of London would hold off the concentrated power of the British Empire for years and take 400,000 Imperial troops to secure victory. The war split the Liberal Party into anti- and pro-war factions. Great orators, such as Liberal David Lloyd George, who spoke against the war, became increasingly influential. Nevertheless, Liberal Unionist Joseph Chamberlain, who was largely in charge of the war, maintained his hold on power.

When General Kitchener took command in 1900, he initiated a scorched earth policy to foil Boer guerrilla tactics. Captured Boer combatants were transported overseas to other British possessions as prisoners of war. However, he relocated non-combatant Boers—mostly women and children—into heavily guarded internment camps. The internment camps were overcrowded with bad sanitation and meagre food rations. Contagious diseases such as measles, typhoid and dysentery were endemic.

Many of the internees died. Emily Hobhouse visited the camps and was appalled at the living conditions, which she brought to the attention of the British public. Public outcry resulted in the Fawcett Commission which corroborated Hobhouse&#x27;s report and eventually led to improved conditions. The Boers surrendered, and the Boer Republics were annexed by the British Empire. Jan Smuts—a leading Boer general—became a senior official of the new government and even became a top British official in the World War.
===Australia===
In 1901, the six British self-governing colonies of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia united to form the Commonwealth of Australia, with almost complete control of its internal affairs, but with foreign policy and defence handled by London. Edmund Barton was the first prime minister.

===The Liberal reforms===


The Liberal Party under Henry Campbell-Bannerman rallied Liberals around the traditional platform of free trade and land reform and led them to the greatest electoral victory in Liberal Party history. The Prime Minister was overshadowed by his frontbench, most notably H. H. Asquith at the Exchequer, Edward Grey at the Foreign Office, Richard Burdon Haldane at the War Office and David Lloyd George at the Board of Trade. Campbell-Bannerman retired in 1908 and was succeeded by Asquith. He stepped up the government&#x27;s radicalism, especially in the &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot; of 1909 that proposed to fund expanded social welfare programmes with new taxes on land and high incomes. It was blocked by the Conservative-dominated House of Lords, but eventually became law in April 1910.
Almost half of the Liberal MPs elected in 1906 were supportive of the &quot;new liberalism&quot;, which advocated government action to improve people&#x27;s lives.

Liberals in 1906–1911 passed major legislation designed to reform politics and society, such as the regulation of working hours, National Insurance and the beginnings of the welfare state, as well as curtailing the power of the House of Lords. Women&#x27;s suffrage was not on the Liberal agenda. There were numerous major reforms helping labour, typified by the Trade Boards Act 1909 that set minimum wages in certain trades with the history of &quot;sweated&quot; or &quot;sweatshop&quot; rates of especially low wages, because of surplus of available workers, the presence of women workers, or the lack of skills.

At first it applied to four industries: chain-making, ready-made tailoring, paper-box making, and the machine-made lace and finishing trade. It was later expanded to coal mining and then to other industries with preponderance of unskilled manual labour by the Trade Boards Act 1918. Under the leadership of David Lloyd George Liberals extended minimum wages to farm workers.

Conservative peers in the House of Lords tried to stop the People&#x27;s Budget. The Liberals passed the Parliament Act 1911 to sharply reduce the power of the House of Lords to block legislation. The cost was high, however, as the government was required by the King to call two general elections in 1910 to validate its position and ended up frittering away most of its large majority, with the balance of power held by Labour and Irish Parliamentary Party members.

== Foreign relations ==
=== Ties with France and Russia against Germany ===
Germany&#x27;s Chancellor Otto von Bismarck dominated European diplomacy from 1872 to 1890, with a policy of using the European balance of power to keep the peace. There were no wars. Bismarck was removed by an aggressive young Kaiser Wilhelm in 1890, effectively decentralizing the Bismarckian Order that had been shrewdly managed, and empowering French efforts to isolate Germany. With the formation of the Triple Entente, Germany began to feel encircled: to the West lay France, with whom rivalry was awakening after a generation of dormancy following the Franco-Prussian War, to the East sat Russia, whose rapid industrialization worried Berlin and Vienna.

Joseph Chamberlain, who played a major role in foreign policy in the late 1890s under the Salisbury government, repeatedly tried to open talks with Germany about some sort of alliance. Berlin was not interested. Meanwhile, Paris went to great pains to woo Russia and Great Britain. Key markers were the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894, the 1904 Entente Cordiale linking France and Great Britain, and finally the Anglo-Russian Entente in 1907 which became the Triple Entente. France thus had a formal alliance with Russia, and an informal alignment with Britain, against Germany and Austria. By 1903 good relations had been established with the United States and Japan.

Britain abandoned the policy of holding aloof from the continental powers, so called &quot;Splendid Isolation&quot;, in the 1900s after being isolated during the Boer War. Britain concluded agreements, limited to colonial affairs, with her two major colonial rivals: the Entente Cordiale with France in 1904 and the Anglo-Russian Entente of 1907. Britain&#x27;s alignment was a reaction to an assertive German foreign policy and the build-up of its navy from 1898 which led to the Anglo-German naval arms race. British diplomat Arthur Nicolson argued it was &quot;far more disadvantageous to us to have an unfriendly France and Russia than an unfriendly Germany&quot;.

The impact of the Triple Entente was to improve British relations with France and its ally Russia and to demote the importance to Britain of good relations with Germany. After 1905, foreign policy was tightly controlled by the Liberal Foreign Secretary Edward Grey (1862–1933), who seldom consulted with his party leadership. Grey shared the strong Liberal policy against all wars and against military alliances that would force Britain to take a side in war. However, in the case of the Boer War, Grey held that the Boers had committed an aggression that it was necessary to repulse. The Liberal party split on the issue, with a large faction strongly opposed to the war in Africa.

The Triple Entente between Britain, France and Russia is often compared to the Triple Alliance between Germany, Austria–Hungary and Italy, but historians caution against the comparison. The Entente, in contrast to the Triple Alliance or the Franco-Russian Alliance, was not an alliance of mutual defence, and Britain therefore felt free to make her own foreign policy decisions in 1914. The Liberals were highly moralistic, and by 1914 they were increasingly convinced that German aggression violated international norms, and specifically that its invasion of neutral Belgium was completely unacceptable in terms of morality, of Britain and Germany&#x27;s obligations under the Treaty of London, and of British policy against any one power controlling the continent of Europe.

Until the last few weeks before it started in August 1914, almost no one saw a world war coming. The expectation among the generals was that because of industrial advances any future war would produce a quick victory for the side that was better-prepared, better armed, and faster to move. No one saw that the innovations of recent decades—high explosives, long-range artillery and machine guns—were defensive weapons that practically guaranteed defeat of massed infantry attacks with very high casualties.

===Naval race with Germany===
After 1805 the dominance of Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy was unchallenged; in the 1890s Germany decided to match it. Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz (1849–1930) dominated German naval policy from 1897 until 1916. Before the German Empire formed in 1871, Prussia never had a real navy, nor did the other German states. Tirpitz turned a modest fleet into a world-class one that could threaten the British Royal Navy. The British responded with new technology typified by the Dreadnought. It made every other class of battleship obsolete and, supported by a global network of coaling stations and telegraph cables, enabled Britain to stay well ahead in naval affairs.

Apart from a determination to retain a strong naval advantage, the British lacked a military strategy or plans for a major war.

==Economy==
The Edwardian era stands out as a time of peace and prosperity. Britain&#x27;s growth rate, manufacturing output and GDP (but not GDP per capita) fell behind its rivals, the United States and Germany, though the nation still led the world in trade, finance and shipping, and had strong bases in manufacturing and mining. The industrial sector was slow to adjust to global changes, and there was a striking preference for leisure over entrepreneurship among the elite.

However, London was the financial centre of the world—far more efficient and wide-ranging than New York, Paris or Berlin. Britain had built up a vast reserve of overseas credits in its formal Empire, as well as in an informal empire in Latin America and other nations. It had huge financial holdings in the United States, especially in railways. These assets proved vital in paying for supplies in the first years of the World War. Amenities, especially in urban life, were accumulating—prosperity was highly visible. 
=== Great Unrest: labour upheavals 1910–1914 ===

The working classes were beginning to protest politically for a greater voice in government, especially after 1908, reaching a crescendo known as the Great Unrest in 1910-1914. The extreme agitation included the 1910-1911 Tonypandy riots; the 1911 Liverpool general transport strike; the National coal strike of 1912; and the 1913 Dublin lockout. It was modern Britain&#x27;s worst labour unrest and compares with the 1926 general strike. The period of unrest was labelled &quot;great&quot; not because of its scale, but due to the level of violence employed by both the state and labourers; including deaths of strikers at the hands of police and sabotage on the part of the workers.

The Great Unrest saw an enormous increase in trade union membership, which affected all industries to varying extents. The militants were most active in coal mining, textiles and transportation. Much of the militancy emerged from grassroots protests against falling real wages, with union leadership scrambling to catch up. The new unions of semiskilled workers were the most militant. The National Sailors&#x27; and Firemen&#x27;s Union directed strike activities in many port cities across Britain. The national leadership was strongly supported by local leaders, for example the Glasgow Trades Council. In Glasgow and other major cities there were distinctive local variations. Glasgow was more unified and coherent than most centres. The long-term result was seen in the strength of waterfront organisation on the Clyde River, marked as it was by the emergence of independent locally based unions among both dockers and seamen.

==Social change and improved health==
===Public health===

By the late-1880s, the Industrial Revolution had created new technologies that changed the way people lived. The growth of industry shifts in manufacturing factories, special-purpose machinery and technological innovations, which led to increased productivity. Gender roles shifted as women made use of the new technology to upgrade their lifestyle and their career opportunities.

Mortality declined steadily in urban England and Wales 1870–1917. Robert Millward and Frances N. Bell looked statistically at those factors in the physical environment (especially population density and overcrowding) that raised death rates directly, as well as indirect factors such as price and income movements that affected expenditures on sewers, water supplies, food, and medical staff. The statistical data show that increases in the incomes of households and increases in town tax revenues helped cause the decline of mortality.

The new money permitted higher spending on food, and also on a wide range of health-enhancing goods and services such as medical care. The major improvement in the physical environment was the quality of the housing stock, which rose faster than the population; its quality was increasingly regulated by central and local government. Infant mortality fell faster in England and Wales than in Scotland. Clive Lee argues that one factor was the continued overcrowding in Scotland&#x27;s housing. During the First World War, infant mortality fell sharply across the country. J. M. Winter attributes this to the full employment and higher wages paid to war workers.

===Rising status of women===
For housewives, sewing machines enabled the production of ready-made clothing and made it easier for women to sew their own clothes; more generally, argues Barbara Burman, &quot;home dressmaking was sustained as an important aid for women negotiating wider social shifts and tensions in their lives.&quot; Increased literacy in the middle class gave women wider access to information and ideas. Numerous new magazines appealed to their tastes and helped define femininity.

The inventions of the typewriter, telephone, and new filing systems offered middle-class women increased employment opportunities. So too did the rapid expansion of the school system, and the emergence of the new profession of nursing. Education and status led to demands for female roles in the rapidly expanding world of sports.

Women were very active in church affairs, including attendance at services, Sunday school teaching, fund raising, pastoral care, social work and support for international missionary activities. They were almost completely excluded from practically all leadership roles.

====Women&#x27;s suffrage====

As middle-class women rose in status, they increasingly supported demands for a political voice. There was significant support for woman suffrage in all the parties, but the Liberal Party was in control after 1906 and a handful of its leaders, especially H. H. Asquith, blocked it.

There were numerous organisations which did their work quietly. After 1897, they were increasingly linked together by the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) led by Millicent Fawcett. However, front page publicity was seized by the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU). Founded in 1903, it was tightly controlled by the three Pankhursts, Emmeline Pankhurst (1858–1928), and her daughters Christabel Pankhurst (1880–1958) and Sylvia Pankhurst (1882–1960).

It specialised in highly visible publicity campaigns such as large parades. This had the effect of energising all dimensions of the suffrage movement. While there was a majority of support for suffrage in Parliament, the ruling Liberal Party refused to allow a vote on the issue; the result of which was an escalation in the suffragette campaign. The WSPU, in dramatic contrast to its allies, embarked on a campaign of violence to publicise the issue, even to the detriment of its own aims.

====Birth control====
Although abortion was illegal, it was nevertheless a widespread form of birth control. Used predominantly by working-class women, the procedure was used not only as a means of terminating pregnancy, but also to prevent poverty and unemployment. Those who transported contraceptives could be legally punished. Contraceptives became more expensive over time and had a high failure rate. Unlike contraceptives, abortion did not need any prior planning and was less expensive. Newspaper advertisements were used to promote and sell abortifacients indirectly.

Not all of society was accepting of contraceptives or abortion, and opponents viewed both as part of one and the same sin. Abortion was much more common among the middle classes than among those living in rural areas, where the procedure was not readily available. Women were often tricked into purchasing ineffective pills. In addition to fearing legal reprimands, many physicians did not condone abortion because they viewed it as an immoral procedure potentially endangering a woman&#x27;s life. Because abortion was illegal and physicians refused to perform the procedure, local women provided abortions, often using crochet hooks or similar instruments.

Feminists of the era focused on educating and finding jobs for women, leaving aside the controversial issues of contraceptives and abortion, which in popular opinion were often related to promiscuity and prostitution. The Church condemned abortion as immoral and a form of rebellion against the child-bearing role women were expected to assume. Many considered abortion to be a selfish act that allowed a woman to avoid personal responsibility, contributing to a decline in moral values. Abortion was often a solution for women who already had children and did not want more. Consequently, the size of families decreased drastically.

====Poverty among working-class women====

The Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 defined who could receive monetary relief. The Act reflected and perpetuated prevailing gender conditions. In Edwardian society, men were the source of wealth. The law restricted relief for unemployed, able-bodied male workers, due to the prevailing view that they would find work in the absence of financial assistance. However, women were treated differently. After the Poor Law was passed, women and children received most of the aid.

The law did not recognise single independent women, and put women and children into the same category. If a man was physically disabled, his wife was also treated as disabled under the coverture laws, even though coverture was fast becoming outmoded in the Edwardian era. Unmarried mothers were sent to the workhouse, receiving unfair social treatment such as being restricted from attending church on Sundays.

During marriage disputes, women often lost the rights to their children, even if their husbands were abusive. However, women were increasingly granted custody of their children under seven years of age; this tendency was colloquially known as the &quot;tender years doctrine&quot;, in which it was believed that a child was best left under maternal care until the age of seven.

At the time, single mothers were the poorest sector in society, disadvantaged for at least four reasons. First, women lived longer, often leaving them widowed with children. Second, women had fewer opportunities to work, and when they did find it, their wages were lower than male workers&#x27; wages. Third, women were often less likely to marry or remarry after being widowed, leaving them as the main providers for the remaining family members. Finally, poor women had deficient diets, because their husbands and children received disproportionately large shares of food. Many women were malnourished and had limited access to health care.

====Female servants====
Edwardian Britain had large numbers of male and female domestic servants, in both urban and rural areas. Middle- and upper-class women relied on servants to run their homes smoothly. Servants were provided with food, clothing, housing, and a small wage, and lived in a self-enclosed social system within their employer&#x27;s house. However, the number of domestic servants fell in the Edwardian era due to fewer young people willing to be employed in this capacity.

===Fashion===
The upper classes embraced leisure sports, which resulted in rapid developments in fashion, as more mobile and flexible clothing styles were needed. During the Edwardian era, women wore a very tight corset, or bodice, and dressed in long skirts. The Edwardian era was the last time women wore corsets in everyday life. According to Arthur Marwick, the most striking change of all the developments that occurred during the Great War was the modification in women&#x27;s dress, &quot;for, however far politicians were to put the clocks back in other steeples in the years after the war, no one ever put the lost inches back on the hems of women&#x27;s skirts&quot;.

Fabrics were usually sweet pea shades in chiffon, mousse line de sore, tulle with feather boas and lace. &#x27;High and boned collars for the day; plunging off shoulder décolleté for the evening&#x27;. The tea gown&#x27;s cut was relatively loose compared to the more formal evening gown, and was worn without a corset. The silhouette was flowing, and was usually decorated with lace or with the cheaper Irish crochet.

Long kid gloves, trimmed hats, and parasols were often used as accessories. Parasols are different from umbrellas; they are used for protection from the sun, rather from the rain, though they were often used as ornamentation rather than for function. By the end of the Edwardian era, the hat grew bigger in size, a trend that would continue in the 1910s.

The Edwardians developed new styles in clothing design. The Edwardian Era saw a decrease in the trend for voluminous, heavy skirts:
* The two-piece dress came into vogue. At the start of the decade, skirts were trumpet-shaped.
* Skirts in 1901 often had decorated hems with ruffles of fabric and lace.
* Some dresses and skirts featured trains.
* Tailored jackets, first introduced in 1880, increased in popularity; and by 1900, tailored suits known as tailormades became popular.
* In 1905, skirts fell in soft folds that curved in, then flared out near the hemlines.
* From 1905 to 1907, waistlines rose.
* In 1911, the hobble skirt was introduced: a tight fitting skirt that restricted a woman&#x27;s stride.
* Lingerie dresses, or tea gowns made of soft fabrics, festooned with ruffles and lace were worn indoors.
* Around 1913 women&#x27;s dresses acquired a lower and sometimes V-shaped neckline in contrast to the high collars a generation before. This was considered scandalous by some, and caused outrage among clergy throughout Europe.

===Newspapers===
The turn of the century saw the rise of popular journalism aimed at the lower middle class and tending to deemphasise highly detailed political and international news, which remain the focus of a handful of low-circulation prestige newspapers. These were family-owned and operated, and were primarily interested not in profits but in influence on the nation&#x27;s elite by their control of the news and editorials on serious topics.

The new press, on the other hand, reached vastly larger audiences by emphasis on sports, crime, sensationalism, and gossip about famous personalities. Detailed accounts of major speeches and complex international events were not printed. Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe was the chief innovator. He used his &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; to transform the media along the American model of &quot;Yellow Journalism&quot;. Lord Beaverbrook said he was &quot;the greatest figure who ever strode down Fleet Street&quot;. Harmsworth made a great deal of money, but during the First World War he also wanted political power. For that he purchased the highest prestige newspaper, &quot;The Times&quot;. P. P. Catterall and Colin Seymour-Ure conclude that: 
==The arts==

The Edwardian era corresponds to the French &quot;Belle Époque&quot;. Despite its brief pre-eminence, the period was characterised by its own unique architectural style, fashion, and lifestyle. Art Nouveau had a particularly strong influence. Artists were influenced by the development of the automobile and electricity, and a greater awareness of human rights.

In November 1910, Roger Fry organised the exhibition &quot;Manet and the Post-Impressionists&quot; at the Grafton Galleries, London. This exhibition was the first to prominently feature Gauguin, Manet, Matisse, and Van Gogh in England and brought their art to the public. He followed it up with the &quot;Second Post-Impressionist Exhibition&quot; in 1912.

George Frampton&#x27;s statue of Peter Pan, &quot;erected in Hyde Park in 1912 ... immediately became a source of contention, sparking debate about the role of public statuary and its role in spaces of recreation.&quot;

===Literature===
In fiction, some of the best-known names are J. M. Barrie, Arnold Bennett, G. K. Chesterton, Arthur Conan Doyle, Joseph Conrad, E. M. Forster, John Galsworthy, Kenneth Grahame, M. R. James, Rudyard Kipling, A. A. Milne, E. Nesbit, Beatrix Potter, Saki, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells and P. G. Wodehouse. Apart from these famous writers, this was a period when a great number of novels and short stories were being published, and a significant distinction between &quot;highbrow&quot; literature and popular fiction emerged. Among the most famous works of literary criticism was A. C. Bradley&#x27;s &quot;Shakespearean Tragedy&quot; (1904).

===Music===
Live performances, both amateur and professional, were popular. Henry Wood, Edward Elgar, Gustav Holst, Arnold Bax, George Butterworth, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Thomas Beecham were all active. Military and brass bands often played outside in parks during the summer. The new technology of wax cylinders and gramophone records played on phonographs and talking machines, made live performances permanently available for repetition at any time.

===Performing arts===
Cinema was primitive and audiences preferred live performances to picture shows. Music hall was very popular and widespread; influential performers included male impersonator Vesta Tilley and comic Little Tich.

The most successful playwright of the era was W. Somerset Maugham. In 1908, he had four plays running simultaneously in London, and &quot;Punch&quot; published a cartoon of Shakespeare biting his fingernails nervously as he looked at the billboards. Maugham&#x27;s plays, like his novels, usually had a conventional plot structure, but the decade also saw the rise of the so-called New Drama, represented in plays by George Bernard Shaw, Harley Granville Barker, and Continental imports by Henrik Ibsen and Gerhardt Hauptmann. The actor/manager system, as managed by Sir Henry Irving, Sir George Alexander, and Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, was in decline.

===Architecture===

Notable architects included Edwin Lutyens, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, and Giles Gilbert Scott. In spite of the popularity of Art Nouveau in Europe, the Edwardian Baroque style of architecture was widely favoured for public structures and was a revival of Christopher Wren–inspired designs of the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The change or reversal in taste from the Victorian eclectic styles corresponded with the historical revivals of the period, most prominently earlier Georgian and Neoclassical styles of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

White City Stadium, used for the 1908 Summer Olympics, was the first Olympic Stadium in the UK. Built on the site of the Franco-British Exhibition, it had a seating capacity of 68,000 and was opened by King Edward VII on 27 April 1908. It was the largest structure of its type in the world at the time, and was designed to be awe-inspiring and thereby enhance the love of large-scale spectacle that characterised Edwardian London.

===Film===
Filmmakers Mitchell and Kenyon documented many scenes from Britain and Ireland from 1900 to 1907, sports, parades, factory exits, parks, city streets, boating and the like. Their films have survived in very good quality restored from the original negatives.

==Science and technology==
The period featured many innovations. Ernest Rutherford published his studies on radioactivity. The first transatlantic wireless signals were sent by Guglielmo Marconi, and the Wright brothers flew for the first time.

By the end of the era, Louis Blériot had crossed the English Channel by air; the largest ship in the world, RMS &quot;Olympic&quot;, had sailed on its maiden voyage and her larger sister RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; was under construction; automobiles were common; and the South Pole was reached for the first time by Roald Amundsen&#x27;s and then Robert Falcon Scott&#x27;s teams.

==Sport==

The 1908 Summer Olympic Games were held in London. Popularity of sports tended to conform to class divisions, with tennis and yachting popular among the very wealthy and football favoured by the working class.

=== Football ===
Aston Villa maintained their position as the pre-eminent football team of the era, winning the FA Cup for the fourth time in 1904–05 and their sixth League title in 1909–10. The club colours of claret and sky blue were adopted by Burnley as a tribute to their success in 1910. Sunderland achieved their fourth league title in 1901–02. The era also saw Liverpool (1900–01, 1905–06), Newcastle United (1904–05, 1906–07, 1908–09) and Manchester United (1907–08) winning their first league titles.

<doc id="100097" wikidata="Q272069" url="?curid=100097" title="Damon Albarn">
<text>Damon Albarn (, ; born 23 March 1968) is an English musician, singer-songwriter, and record producer. He is the frontman and main lyricist of the rock band Blur and the co-creator and primary musical contributor of the virtual band Gorillaz.

Raised in Leytonstone, East London, and around Colchester, Essex, Albarn attended the Stanway School, where he met the guitarist Graham Coxon, with whom he would later form Blur. They released their debut album &quot;Leisure&quot; in 1991. After spending long periods touring the US, Albarn&#x27;s songwriting became increasingly influenced by British bands from the 1960s. The result was the Blur albums &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; (1993), &quot;Parklife&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1995). All three received critical acclaim, while Blur gained mass popularity in the UK, aided by a Britpop chart rivalry with Oasis. Chart-topping albums such as &quot;Blur&quot; (1997), &quot;13&quot; (1999) and &quot;Think Tank&quot; (2003) incorporated influences from lo-fi, art rock, electronic and world music. These were followed by &quot;The Magic Whip&quot; (2015), Blur&#x27;s first studio album in 12 years, and &quot;The Ballad of Darren&quot; in 2023.

Albarn formed the virtual band Gorillaz in 1998 with the comic book artist Jamie Hewlett. Drawing influences from hip hop, dub, pop, trip hop and world music, Gorillaz released their self-titled debut album in 2001 to worldwide success, spawning numerous successful follow-ups and continuing to release albums and tour into the 2020s. Albarn remains the group&#x27;s only consistent musical contributor. His other notable projects include the supergroups the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen and Rocket Juice &amp; the Moon. He co-founded the non-profit musical organisation Africa Express and has composed film soundtracks. Albarn also scored the stage productions &quot;&quot; (2008), &quot;Dr Dee&quot; (2012) and &quot;Wonder.land&quot; (2016). His debut solo album, &quot;Everyday Robots,&quot; was released in 2014, followed by &quot;The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows&quot; in 2021.

In 2008, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named Albarn the 18th-most powerful person in British culture. In 2016, Albarn received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to music. In 2020, Albarn was granted Icelandic citizenship.

==Early life==
Albarn was born in Whitechapel, London. He is the eldest child of artist Keith Albarn and his wife Hazel (&quot;née&quot; Dring). He has some Danish descent through his mother. Their daughter Jessica (born 1971) also went on to become an artist. Hazel, originally from Lincolnshire, was a theatrical set designer for Joan Littlewood&#x27;s theatre company at the Theatre Royal Stratford East in London, and was working on the satirical play &quot;Mrs Wilson&#x27;s Diary&quot; just before Damon was born. Keith, originally from Nottinghamshire, was briefly the manager of Soft Machine and was once a guest on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night Line-Up&quot;. He was head of the Colchester School of Art at Colchester Institute.

Damon&#x27;s paternal grandfather Edward, an architect, had been a conscientious objector during the Second World War and was involved in a farming community in Lincolnshire, becoming a peace activist. In 2002 Edward Albarn died; Damon stated in an interview that Edward did not want to live any longer and decided to go on a hunger strike. In 1968, at the age of six months, Albarn was a &quot;testing expert&quot; for designs for educational aids and toys for children including fibreglass furniture and play-structures fancifully called &quot;The Kissmequiosk&quot;. &quot;The Apollo Cumfycraft&quot; and &quot;The Tailendcharlie&quot; produced by his father&#x27;s company &quot;Keith Albarn &amp; Partners Ltd&quot; under the trade-name of &quot;Playlearn, Ltd.&quot;

When Damon and Jessica were growing up, their family moved to Leytonstone, East London. The household was described as &quot;bohemian&quot; and their upbringing as &quot;liberal&quot;. Damon and Jessica were also raised in the Quaker religion. Albarn agreed with his parents&#x27; views, later claiming, &quot;I always thought my parents were absolutely dead right. I went against the grain in a weird way – by continually following them.&quot; His parents primarily listened to blues, Indian ragas and African music. When Albarn was nine years old, his family took a holiday trip to Turkey for three months before settling in Aldham Fordstreet, Essex, an area described by Albarn as &quot;one of those burgeoning Thatcher experiments where they were building loads of small estates&quot;. The population of the area was predominantly white as opposed to the ethnically mixed part of London which he had become used to. He described himself as &quot;not really fitting in with the politics of the place.&quot;

Albarn was interested in music from an early age, attending an Osmonds concert at the age of six. He started playing guitar, piano and violin in his youth and was interested in composing music, one of his compositions winning a heat in the nationwide Young Composer of the Year competition. Damon and Jessica both attended a primary school nearby which, according to Damon, was burnt down seven times over a period of 18 months by one of the teachers. After both siblings failed their Eleven-Plus exams, they started attending Stanway Comprehensive School, where Damon described himself as being &quot;really unpopular&quot; and &quot;[irritating to] a lot of people&quot;. However, he developed an interest in drama and started acting in various school productions. It was at Stanway where he would meet future Blur guitarist Graham Coxon, who recalls seeing him act and feeling that he was a &quot;confident performer&quot; as well as a &quot;show off&quot;. Albarn&#x27;s first words directed at Coxon were &quot;Your brogues are crap, mate. Look, mine are the proper sort&quot; as he was showing off his leather shoes, fashionable footwear at the time influenced by the Mod Revival. Nevertheless, the pair went on to become good friends, owing to their shared passion for music, particularly bands such as the Jam, the Beatles, the Human League, XTC and Madness. Albarn has also credited the Specials and Fun Boy Three as some of his earliest influences, and John Lennon in his taking up songwriting.

He studied acting at the East 15 Acting School in Debden, but left after the first year. On leaving drama school he entered a production and management contract with Marijke Bergkamp and Graeme Holdaway, owners of the Beat Factory recording studio, where the members of Blur, then known as Seymour, did their first recordings. His first band was the synthpop group, Two&#x27;s a Crowd. Before Blur, he played with the Aftermath and Real Lives.

==Music career==
===Blur===
====Formation and &quot;Leisure&quot;====

Albarn enrolled on a part-time music course at London&#x27;s Goldsmiths College in 1988, claiming that his sole intention was to gain access to the student union bar. Albarn was in a group named Circus alongside Coxon and drummer Dave Rowntree. Alex James, a fellow student at Goldsmiths, eventually joined as the group&#x27;s bassist. They changed their name to Seymour in December 1988, inspired by J.D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;.&quot; In March 1990, after changing their name to Blur, they signed to Food Records.

In October 1990, Blur released their first single, &quot;She&#x27;s So High&quot;, which reached number 48 in the UK Singles Chart. The band had trouble creating a follow-up single, but made progress when paired with producer Stephen Street. The resulting single, &quot;There&#x27;s No Other Way&quot;, became a hit, peaking at number eight. As a result of the single&#x27;s success, Blur became pop stars and were accepted into a clique of bands who frequented the Syndrome club in London dubbed the &quot;Scene That Celebrates Itself&quot;. The recording of the group&#x27;s debut album was hindered by Albarn having to write his lyrics in the studio. Although the resulting album &quot;Leisure&quot; (1991) peaked at number seven on the UK Albums Chart, it received mixed reviews, and according to journalist John Harris, &quot;could not shake off the odour of anti-climax&quot;. Albarn has since referred to &quot;Leisure&quot; as &quot;awful&quot;.

====Britpop era====
After discovering they were £60,000 in debt, Blur toured the US in 1992 in an attempt to recoup their losses. Albarn and the band became increasingly unhappy and homesick during the two-month American tour and began writing songs which &quot;created an English atmosphere&quot;. Blur had undergone an ideological and image shift intended to celebrate their English heritage in contrast to the popularity of American grunge bands like Nirvana. Although sceptical of Albarn&#x27;s new manifesto, Balfe gave his assent for the band&#x27;s choice of Andy Partridge of the band XTC to produce their follow-up to &quot;Leisure&quot;. The sessions with Partridge proved unsatisfactory, but a chance reunion with Stephen Street resulted in him returning to produce the group.

The second Blur album, &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot;, was released in May 1993 and peaked at number 15 on the British charts, but failed to break into the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling only 19,000 copies. Despite the album&#x27;s poor performance, Albarn was happy with the band&#x27;s direction and wrote prolifically for Blur&#x27;s next album. &quot;Parklife&quot; was released in 1994 and revived Blur&#x27;s commercial fortunes, with the album&#x27;s first single, the disco-influenced &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot;, achieving critical acclaim and chart success. &quot;Parklife&quot; entered the British charts at number one and stayed in the album charts for 90 weeks. Enthusiastically greeted by the music press, &quot;Parklife&quot; is regarded as one of Britpop&#x27;s defining records. Blur won four awards at the 1995 Brit Awards, including Best British Group and British Album of the Year for &quot;Parklife&quot;. Coxon later pointed to &quot;Parklife&quot; as the moment when &quot;[Blur] went from being regarded as an alternative, leftfield arty band to this amazing new pop sensation&quot;. Albarn was uncomfortable with fame, however, and he suffered from panic attacks.

Blur began working on their fourth album &quot;The Great Escape&quot; at the start of 1995. Building upon the band&#x27;s previous two albums, Albarn&#x27;s lyrics for the album consisted of several third-person narratives. James reflected, &quot;It was all more elaborate, more orchestral, more theatrical, and the lyrics were even more twisted ... It was all dysfunctional, misfit characters fucking up.&quot; The release of the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Country House&quot; played a part in Blur&#x27;s public rivalry with Manchester band Oasis termed the &quot;Battle of Britpop&quot;. Partly due to increasing antagonism between the groups, Blur and Oasis decided to release their new singles on the same day, an event the &quot;NME&quot; called the &quot;British Heavyweight Championship&quot;. The debate over which band would top the British singles chart became a media phenomenon, and Albarn appeared on &quot;News at Ten&quot;. At the end of the week, &quot;Country House&quot; outsold Oasis&#x27; &quot;Roll With It&quot; by 274,000 copies to 216,000, becoming Blur&#x27;s first number-one single.

&quot;The Great Escape&quot; was released in September 1995 to positive reviews, and entered the UK charts at number one. However, opinion quickly changed and Blur found themselves largely out of favour with the media. BBC Music writer James McMahon recalled how the &quot;critical euphoria&quot; surrounding the album lasted &quot;about as long as it took publishers to realise Oasis would probably shift more magazines for them&quot;. Following the worldwide success of Oasis&#x27; &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;, the media quipped that Blur &quot;wound up winning the battle but losing the war.&quot; Blur became perceived as an &quot;inauthentic middle-class pop band&quot; in comparison to &quot;working-class heroes&quot; Oasis, which Albarn said made him feel &quot;stupid and confused&quot;. Bassist James said: &quot;After being the People&#x27;s Hero, Damon was the People&#x27;s Prick for a short period ... basically, he was a loser – very publicly.&quot; In the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, Stuart Maconie noted &quot;Albarn... was mocked as the posh boy of Britpop when in fact he’d gone to a comprehensive in Essex and his family was just mildly bohemian. Nowadays he’d be decidedly &#x27;below stairs&#x27;&quot;.

====Post-Britpop and hiatus====
An early 1996 &quot;Q&quot; interview reported that relations between Blur members had become strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy wrote that he found them &quot;on the verge of a nervous breakup.&quot; Coxon, in particular, began to resent his bandmates and, in a rejection of the group&#x27;s Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement. Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon&#x27;s tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to change Blur&#x27;s musical direction once again. &quot;I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you&#x27;ve got to move on,&quot; he said, and decided to give Coxon more creative control over their new album. Albarn visited Iceland during this period: &quot;I used to have a recurring dream, as a child, of a black sand beach. And one hazy, lazy day [laughs], I was watching the TV and I saw a programme about Iceland, and they had black beaches. So I got on a plane ... I was on my own. I didn&#x27;t know anybody. I went into the street, Laugavegur, where the bars are, and that was it.&quot;

After initial sessions in London, the band left to record the rest of the album in Iceland, away from the Britpop scene. The result was &quot;Blur&quot;, the band&#x27;s fifth studio album, released in February 1997. Although the music press predicted that the lo-fi sonic experimentation would alienate Blur&#x27;s teenage girl fanbase, they generally applauded the effort. Pointing out lyrics such as &quot;Look inside America / She&#x27;s alright&quot;, and noting Albarn&#x27;s &quot;obligatory nod to Beck, [and promotion of] the new Pavement album as if paid to do so&quot;, reviewers felt the band had come to accept American values during this time – an about-face of their attitude during the Britpop years. Despite cries of &quot;commercial suicide,&quot; the album and its first single, &quot;Beetlebum&quot;, debuted at number one in the UK. Although the album could not match the sales of their previous albums in the UK, &quot;Blur&quot; became the band&#x27;s most successful internationally, particularly in the US, helped by the successful single &quot;Song 2&quot;. After the success of &quot;Blur&quot;, the band embarked on a nine-month world tour.
Blur&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;13&quot;, released in March 1999, saw them drift further from Britpop. Albarn&#x27;s lyrics – more heartfelt, personal and intimate than on previous occasions – were reflective of his break-up with Elastica frontwoman Justine Frischmann, his partner of eight years. Recording for Blur&#x27;s next album began in London in November 2001. Not long after the sessions began, Coxon left the group. Coxon stated &quot;there were no rows&quot; and &quot;[the band] just recognised the feeling that we needed some time apart&quot;. &quot;Think Tank&quot;, released in May 2003, was filled with atmospheric, brooding electronic sounds, featuring simpler guitar lines by Albarn, and largely relying on other instruments to replace Coxon. The guitarist&#x27;s absence also meant that &quot;Think Tank&quot; was written mostly by Albarn. Its sound was seen as testament to Albarn&#x27;s increasing interest in African and Middle Eastern music and to his control over the group&#x27;s direction. &quot;Think Tank&quot; was another UK No. 1 and achieved Blur&#x27;s highest US position of No. 56. The album was also nominated for best album at the 2004 Brit Awards.

====Reunion====

In December 2008, Blur announced they would reunite for a concert at London&#x27;s Hyde Park on 3 July 2009. Days later, the band added a second date, for 2 July. A series of June preview shows were also announced, ending at Manchester Evening News arena on the 26th. All the shows were well received; &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s music critic Alexis Petridis gave their performance at Goldsmiths College a full five stars, and wrote that &quot;Blur&#x27;s music seems to have potentiated by the passing of years ... they sound both more frenetic and punky and more nuanced and exploratory than they did at the height of their fame&quot;. Blur headlined the Glastonbury Festival on 28 June, where they played for the first time since their headline slot in 1998. Reviews of the Glastonbury performance were enthusiastic; &quot;The Guardian&quot; called them &quot;the best Glastonbury headliners in an age&quot;.

The band released their second greatest-hits album &quot;&quot; in June 2009. After the completion of the reunion dates, Albarn told &quot;Q&quot; that the band had no intention of recording or touring live again. He said, &quot;I just can&#x27;t do it anymore&quot;, and explained that the main motivation for participating in the reunion was to repair his relationship with Coxon, which succeeded.

In January 2010, &quot;No Distance Left to Run&quot;, a documentary about the band, was released in cinemas and a month later on DVD and was nominated as Best Long Form Music Video for the 53rd Grammy Awards, Blur&#x27;s first-ever Grammy nomination. In April 2010, Blur released their first new recording since 2003, &quot;Fool&#x27;s Day&quot; in April 2010 as part of the Record Store Day event as a vinyl record limited to 1000 copies; it was later made available as a free download on their website.

In February 2012, Blur were awarded the Outstanding Contribution to Music award at the 2012 Brit Awards. Later that month, Albarn and Coxon premiered a new track together live, &quot;Under the Westway&quot;. Blur entered the studio early that year to record material for a new album, but in May producer William Orbit told the &quot;NME&quot; that Albarn had halted recording. Blur released two singles &quot;The Puritan&quot; and &quot;Under the Westway&quot; on 2 July. That August, Blur headlined a show at Hyde Park for the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony which was followed by a world tour the following year. On 19 February 2015, Blur announced on social media that they would be releasing their eighth studio album on 27 April, titled &quot;The Magic Whip&quot;, Blur&#x27;s first album in 12 years and first in 16 years in their original line-up.

===Gorillaz===

Albarn and Jamie Hewlett met in 1990 when Coxon, a fan of Hewlett&#x27;s work, asked him to interview Blur. The interview was published in &quot;Deadline&quot; magazine, home of Hewlett&#x27;s comic strip, &quot;Tank Girl&quot;. Hewlett initially thought Albarn was &quot;arsey, a wanker&quot;, and despite becoming one of the band&#x27;s acquaintances, Hewlett often did not get on with its members, especially after he started going out with Coxon&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, Jane Olliver. Nonetheless, Albarn and Hewlett started sharing a flat on Westbourne Grove in London in 1997. Hewlett had recently broken up with Olliver and Albarn was also at the end of his highly publicised relationship with Frischmann.

The idea to create Gorillaz came about when the two were watching MTV: &quot;If you watch MTV for too long, it&#x27;s a bit like hell—there&#x27;s nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a cartoon band, something that would be a comment on that,&quot; Hewlett said. The band&#x27;s music is a collaboration between various musicians, Albarn being the only permanent musical contributor, and incorporates influences including alternative rock, Britpop, dub, hip-hop, and pop music. In 2001, the band&#x27;s eponymous debut album sold over seven million copies, and featured hits such as the songs &quot;19-2000&quot; and &quot;Clint Eastwood,&quot; earning them an entry in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the Most Successful Virtual Band.

The second Gorillaz studio album, &quot;Demon Days&quot;, was released in 2005 and included the singles &quot;Feel Good Inc.&quot;, &quot;Dare&quot;, &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, &quot;Kids with Guns&quot; and &quot;El Mañana&quot;. &quot;Demon Days&quot; went five times platinum in the UK, double platinum in the United States and earned five Grammy Award nominations for 2006 and won one of them in the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals category. The combined sales of &quot;Gorillaz&quot; and &quot;Demon Days&quot; had, by 2007, exceeded 15 million albums. Gorillaz released their third studio album, &quot;Plastic Beach&quot;, in early 2010, which was received with high praise. In December 2010, the group released &quot;The Fall,&quot; recorded over 32 days during their North American tour.

In a 2012 interview, Albarn talked about the unlikelihood of any future Gorillaz releases; his relationship with Hewlett had soured when Albarn chose to undercut the role of animation on their &quot;Escape to Plastic Beach World Tour&quot;. Albarn later rescinded this claim, stating &quot;When Jamie [Hewlett] and I have worked out our differences, I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll make another record.&quot; On 23 March 2017, the fifth Gorillaz studio album, &quot;Humanz&quot;, was announced and released worldwide on 28 April 2017. The sixth Gorillaz album, &quot;The Now Now&quot;, was announced on 31 May 2018 and released on 29 June 2018. In 2020, Gorillaz began a project called &quot;Song Machine&quot;, in which new songs with collaborations would be released as monthly &quot;episodes&quot;. The first nine episodes were compiled together along with more songs in Gorillaz&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez&quot;, which was released on 23 October 2020 to positive reviews. A second season of Song Machine was planned, though it was later scrapped. On 31 August 2022, their eighth studio album, &quot;Cracker Island&quot; was announced, and was later released on 24 February 2023.

===Solo career and side projects===
In 2000, Albarn participated in the soundtrack of &quot;Ordinary Decent Criminal&quot;.
Albarn released &quot;Mali Music&quot; in 2002, recorded in Mali, during a trip he made to support Oxfam in 2000. He has visited Nigeria to record music with Nigerian drummer Tony Allen.

In 2003, Albarn released an EP, &quot;Democrazy&quot;, a compilation of demos he recorded in various hotel rooms during the United States portion of &quot;Think Tank&quot;″s tour.

Albarn collaborated with producers Dan the Automator, XL Recordings, Richard Russell &amp; Rodaidh McDonald, Jneiro Jarel, DJ Darren Cunningham aka Actress, Marc Antoine, Alwest, Remi Kabaka Jr., Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs and Kwes as part of his week-long visit to Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo to record an album, &quot;Kinshasa One Two&quot;, released in 2011. All proceeds benefit Oxfam&#x27;s work in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

&quot;Maison Des Jeunes&quot;, an album for Albarn&#x27;s project Africa Express, was released in 2013. In 2014, Albarn appeared in the song &quot;Go Back&quot; in Tony Allen&#x27;s albums &quot;Film of Life&quot; and &quot;The Source&quot;.

In a 2013 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Albarn announced that a forthcoming solo record would be produced by Richard Russell of XL Recordings. He also said he would be taking his album on tour, and that he would play songs from all of his other bands, including Blur and Gorillaz. Albarn&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Everyday Robots,&quot; was released on 25 April 2014 to generally positive reviews. The album peaked at No. 2 on the UK charts and produced five singles: &quot;Everyday Robots&quot;, &quot;Lonely Press Play&quot;, &quot;Hollow Ponds&quot;, &quot;Mr Tembo&quot;, and &quot;Heavy Seas of Love&quot;. It was nominated for the 2014 &quot;Mercury Prize&quot; for Best Album.

In 2018, Albarn collaborated with Kali Uchis, taking co-writing credits and performing on the song &quot;In My Dreams&quot;, which appears on Uchis&#x27; album Isolation.

In June 2021, Transgressive Records announced that they had signed Albarn and would be releasing his second solo album, after which Albarn revealed the title &quot;The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows&quot; and 12 November release date alongside the title track&#x27;s release.

====The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen====
In May 2006, NME reported that Albarn was working with Danger Mouse on his first solo album, with the group billed as the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen. It featured Paul Simonon, Simon Tong and Tony Allen. The album was awarded Best Album at the 2007 MOJO Awards on 18 June.

The first single by the line-up, &quot;Herculean&quot;, was released in late October 2006, and peaked at No. 22 in the UK Singles Chart. A second single, &quot;Kingdom of Doom&quot;, and the band&#x27;s debut album were then released in January 2007. That single fared slightly better than &quot;Herculean&quot;, peaking at No. 20, while the album peaked at No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart and went gold during its first week of release in the UK. &quot;Green Fields&quot; was released as the third single from the album in April 2007, just missing out on the Top 50. On 27 April 2008, the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen headlined the Love Music Hate Racism Carnival in Victoria Park where they introduced on stage several guests including ex-Specials keyboard player Jerry Dammers. He also worked with Syrian rapper and friend Eslam Jawaad on the song &quot;Mr. Whippy&quot;, though the song does not appear on the album it is a B-side on the Herculean single.

====Rocket Juice and the Moon====

&quot;Rocket Juice &amp; the Moon&quot; is the title of Albarn&#x27;s side-project featuring Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and afrobeat legend Tony Allen. Albarn has stated that he is not responsible for the name; someone in Lagos did the sleeve design and that was the name it was given. Albarn has claimed that he is content with the outcome, as trying to come up with band names is difficult for him. The band performed together for the first time on 28 October 2011 in Cork, Ireland, as part of the annual Cork Jazz Festival. They performed under the moniker Another Honest Jon&#x27;s Chop Up!. Their debut album was released on 26 March 2012.

====Studio 13====
Albarn, along with Tom Girling and Jason Cox, established Studio 13, a recording studio for their own use, with the first projects at 13 being pre-production work for Blur&#x27;s similarly-named album, as well as Albarn&#x27;s contributions to the &quot;Ravenous&quot; soundtrack. Since then, Studio 13 has been used not only for Albarn&#x27;s projects, but also by other notable artists, including Paul Simonon, Jorja Smith, and others.

====Other projects====
In 1998, Albarn and Michael Nyman recorded the song &quot;London Pride&quot; for the tribute album, &quot;Twentieth-Century Blues: The Songs of Noël Coward&quot;, a patriotic song Noël Coward had written in the spring of 1941 during the Blitz.

Collaboration with Terry Hall during 1994–2003:  Having cited Hall as one of his early influences very often, Albarn and Hall went on and held a friendship for many years. They collaborated for multiple times including &quot;The Rainbows EP&quot;, in which Albarn co-wrote lead track &quot;Chasing A Rainbow&quot; with Hall. Later in Hall’s second solo album &quot;Laugh&quot; released in 1997, the two co-wrote &quot;For The Girl&quot; and &quot;A Room Full Of Nothing&quot;. Hall also sang on a non-album track &quot;911&quot; by Gorillaz; they were both lead vocals on &quot;Lil&#x27; Dub Chefin&#x27;&quot; by Spacemonkeyz vs Gorillaz for both album and single version. In 2003, Hall and Mushtaq released &quot;The Hour of Two Lights&quot;, in which Albarn co-wrote and sang on the track &quot;Ten Eleven&quot;. The album was also released on Albarn&#x27;s label Honest Jon&#x27;s Records in the UK.

In 2003, Albarn worked with the garage rock band the Strokes on their album &quot;Room on Fire&quot;. Producer Gordon Raphael claims that Albarn was experimenting with backing vocals on the record. In the end, however, Albarn&#x27;s contributions did not make the record. &quot;Well, I guess the songs are just perfect the way they are,&quot; Albarn stated. In the same year he performed &quot;Fashion&quot; live with David Bowie.

Albarn has contributed backing vocals to the songs &quot;FM&quot; on Nathan Haines&#x27; &quot;Squire for Hire&quot; and &quot;Small Time Shot Away&quot; on Massive Attack&#x27;s &quot;100th Window&quot;, which were released in 2003, however, for both tracks, credit was given to Gorillaz frontman 2-D instead. More recently, on Massive Attack&#x27;s 2010 &quot;Heligoland&quot; album, he sang on the track &quot;Saturday Come Slow&quot; and contributed keyboards to the track &quot;Splitting the Atom&quot;.

Albarn also produced soul singer Bobby Womack&#x27;s twenty-seventh studio album &quot;The Bravest Man in the Universe&quot;, released in 2012. He recently performed on Jools Holland&#x27;s &quot;Hootenanny on New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;, performing the track &quot;Love is Gonna Lift You Up&quot;. Albarn appeared with Womack at the Glastonbury Festival 2013.

In 2016, Albarn appeared on De La Soul&#x27;s studio album &quot;And the Anonymous Nobody...&quot; on the song &quot;Here in After&quot;. Albarn had previously collaborated with the group on Gorillaz&#x27; albums &quot;Demon Days&quot;, &quot;Plastic Beach&quot;, and &quot;Humanz&quot; on the songs &quot;Feel Good Inc&quot;, &quot;Superfast Jellyfish&quot;, and &quot;Momentz&quot;, respectively.

In 2017, Albarn sung with Alex Crossan (Mura Masa) on &quot;Blu&quot;, the last track of their debut album.

In February of 2025, Albarn contributed to Is This What We Want?, a fully silent album made by 1000 UK artists, in protest against copyright laws in the UK regarding artificial intelligence.

===Film, theatre and soundtrack work===
&quot;Closet Romantic&quot; appeared on the soundtrack for &quot;Trainspotting&quot; alongside an early Blur recording, &quot;Sing&quot;, which is from their debut album. Albarn composed the score with collaboration by Michael Nyman for the 1999 movie &quot;Ravenous&quot;, and was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Music for his work.

In their first major work together since Gorillaz, Albarn and Hewlett, along with acclaimed Chinese theatre and opera director Chen Shi-zheng, adapted for stage the Chinese story &quot;Journey to the West&quot; as &quot;&quot;, which received its world premiere as the opening show of the 2007 Manchester International Festival, on 28 June 2007 at the Palace Theatre, Manchester.

In collaboration with theatre director Rufus Norris, Albarn has created an opera for the 2011 Manchester International Festival based on the life of Elizabethan scientist John Dee and titled &quot;Doctor Dee&quot;.

Albarn recorded the film score for the film version of the book &quot;The Boy in the Oak&quot;, which was written by his sister, Jessica Albarn. The film was set for a spring 2011 release in select theatres.

In 2014, Albarn contributed the song &quot;Sister Rust&quot; to the soundtrack of science fiction film &quot;Lucy&quot;.

Albarn wrote the music for a musical based on &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; called &quot;Wonder.land&quot; with Rufus Norris and Moira Buffini, which officially premiered in the Manchester International Festival on 29 June 2015.

Albarn provided a track for the film &quot;The White Helmets&quot; called &quot;Crashing Down&quot;, an abandoned track initially planned for the Gorillaz album &quot;Plastic Beach&quot;.

===The Heavy Seas===
Albarn&#x27;s live band is called the Heavy Seas, and features guitarist Seye, drummer Pauli the PSM, guitarist Jeff Wootton and Mike Smith on keyboards. Both Smith and Wootton had previously been a part of Gorillaz&#x27; &quot;Escape to Plastic Beach World Tour&quot;. With the exception of drummer Pauli, all members have played live with Gorillaz.

==Acting appearances==
Albarn starred in Antonia Bird&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;Face&quot; alongside Ray Winstone and Robert Carlyle. Albarn was also featured in Gunar Karlsson&#x27;s 2007 film, &quot;Anna and the Moods&quot;, along with Terry Jones and Björk. Albarn played &quot;Bull&quot; in Joe Orton&#x27;s &quot;Up Against It&quot;, a Radio 4 play originally written for the Beatles broadcast in 1998.

==Personal life==
Albarn had a long-standing and publicized relationship with Elastica frontwoman Justine Frischmann from 1991 to 1998. This relationship profoundly influenced his songwriting, notably on the &quot;Blur&quot; album (1997) on the track &quot;Beetlebum&quot; – said to be about their experiences with heroin – and a number of tracks on &quot;13&quot; (1999), such as &quot;Tender&quot; and &quot;No Distance Left to Run&quot;, said to be about their break-up in 1998.

Albarn began a relationship with artist Suzi Winstanley in 1998. Winstanley gave birth to their daughter, Missy, named after hip hop artist Missy Elliott, on 2 October 1999. Albarn described becoming a father as &quot;witnessing a life force&quot; and saying:It massively changes you. It slowly sort of shaves off the unpleasant thorny bits and hopefully creates a nicely rounded... I don&#x27;t know, having a kid, you just become far more, inevitably you look to the future far more and, you know, it&#x27;s desperate sometimes when you have a particularly bad few weeks of the newspaper just reminding you about this is wrong, this is wrong. We&#x27;ve got ten more years everyone.
Albarn and Winstanley are speculated to have separated in 2023, with reviewers noting allusions to a breakup in the lyrics of Blur&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;The Ballad of Darren&quot; (2023). Albarn has declined to specify if these lyrics are related to his relationship status with Winstanley. However, in an interview with Paris Match, he stated that he had had a difficult breakup within the last few months, without mentioning anyone by name.

In 2006, Albarn was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from the University of East London, saying it was &quot;great to receive [the] award from an institution where my dad used to work and which I, as a child, used to think of as that big building with lots of interesting people in&quot;.

In 2015, Albarn was made an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the Queen&#x27;s New Year Honours list of December 31, which recognises British citizens for their achievements in public life and service to the United Kingdom.

In 2016, Albarn, a long-time advocate of the music of Mali, titling his 2002 album &quot;Mali Music&quot;, has been given the title &quot;Local King&quot;, and has had a school of music and dance named after him south of Bamako.

In 2020, Albarn was granted Icelandic citizenship. He visited the country in the mid-90s for recording, as well as on holiday, and subsequently bought a house in Reykjavík.

Albarn is known to have homes in the Notting Hill neighbourhood of London, and Devon. Albarn is a fan of Chelsea F.C.

A bead necklace he frequently wore was a gift given to him by his mother when he was six.

===Philanthropy===
Albarn has been an active supporter of various charities and philanthropic efforts throughout his career as a musician and has been involved in various charity albums and singles. DRC Music, a collective formed by Albarn, released their debut album &quot;Kinshasa One Two&quot; as a charity album in which all of the money earned is given to Oxfam. Albarn has also formed a collective with Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist Nick Zinner, and Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos to make a charity single with the money earned from that single also donated to Oxfam. In 2013 Albarn, alongside fellow Blur bandmate Graham Coxon, performed live with former rival Noel Gallagher of Oasis and Paul Weller of the Jam to play Blur&#x27;s 1999 single &quot;Tender&quot; in support of Teenage Cancer Trust.

==Politics and activism==
In 2005, Albarn, among others, criticised the London Live 8 concert for not featuring enough black artists; among the few included were Ms. Dynamite, Snoop Dogg, and Youssou N&#x27;Dour. Eventually the organisers added a separate concert at the Eden Project in Cornwall to the programme to showcase African musicians. Albarn said he did not want to perform at Live 8 because he thought it was too &quot;exclusive&quot; and may have been motivated by self-promotion.

Albarn has been a vocal critic of celebrity culture, saying: &quot;We need to dismantle very significant parts of our culture and really re-examine them. I suppose you start with the celebrity thing... you have to get rid of things like &quot;The X Factor&quot; immediately.&quot;

Albarn was a vocal critic of the United Kingdom&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union, describing it as &quot;wrong&quot; and saying that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me whatsoever.&quot; Albarn was a signatory on a 2018 editorial advocating for a &quot;Citizen&#x27;s Assembly&quot; to resolve the parliamentary deadlock over withdrawal terms. Albarn stated that the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen album &quot;Merrie Land&quot; (2018) was inspired by Brexit and his reaction to it.

Albarn has been a vocal supporter of Palestinian rights, cancelling concerts in Israel following the Gaza flotilla raid in 2010 and played a concert at the Labour Friends of Palestine and the Middle East Gala Dinner in 2014. During Glastonbury Festival 2024, Albarn gave a pro-Palestine speech, labeling the Israel–Hamas war an &quot;unfair war&quot; and encouraging people to vote in the upcoming UK general election.

===Anti-war activism===
Albarn is anti-war, holding views shared by others in his family, including his grandfather Edward Albarn, who died during a hunger strike in 2002. In November 2001, shortly after the United States invasion of Afghanistan in response to September 11 attacks, the MTV Europe Music Awards were held in Frankfurt, where Gorillaz won awards for Best Song and Best Dance. As Albarn and Jamie Hewlett walked onto stage to make a speech after receiving the latter award, Albarn wore a T-shirt with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament logo on it. In his speech, he said &quot;So, fuck the music. Listen. See this symbol here, [pointing to the T-shirt] this the symbol for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Bombing one of the poorest countries in the world is wrong. You&#x27;ve got a voice and you have got to do what you can about it alright?&quot;

In 2002, Iraq was under threat of invasion from a United States-led coalition. Opposition to the planned invasion led to protests being organised by a number of organisations. Albarn spoke out against the invasion. Albarn teamed up with Robert &quot;3D&quot; Del Naja of Massive Attack and worked with Stop the War Coalition, CND and the Muslim Association of Britain to organise campaigns to oppose British involvement in the war. This included spending £15,000 on anti-war adverts which ran in the &quot;NME&quot;, featuring quotes from Tony Benn and the former US Attorney-General, Ramsey Clark.

Albarn revealed that originally, many people whom he knew were against the Iraq War were reluctant to take a stand, stating &quot;to be honest with you when Robert Del Naja and myself started really stepping up prior to the war it was very difficult to find anyone. And I don&#x27;t want to name any names because they are people who I respect but they were really, for some reason, very reticent to stand with us. A lot of people who you would now associate with being anti-war at that particular point didn&#x27;t seem to be prepared to do it.&quot;

He was due to speak in Hyde Park on the rally in February 2003 when a million people took to the streets of London in protest at the imminent war. In the event, he was too emotional to deliver his speech. Albarn later revealed that he had &quot;this image of my grandad in his slippers reading the paper, knowing that his grandson had been involved in something which he&#x27;d put so much of his life into&quot; and &quot;got over-emotional&quot;. He also stated that &quot;it obviously wasn&#x27;t the best moment to get in that state, when you&#x27;re at the head of the biggest peace march in the history of this country.&quot; Albarn also attended a protest in November where he commented on the diversity of people in attendance, saying that &quot;It represents everybody. It&#x27;s the voice in our democracy and that&#x27;s why we should be listened to.&quot; Speaking about the experience in 2008, Albarn stated:I think in this case the only reason we went to war was the result of our individual apathy in the end. You know, our inability to really express what was I think was a consensus that this was a terrifying idea and a very badly thought-out one.

<doc id="100098" wikidata="Q1139465" url="?curid=100098" title="Signalling System No. 7">
<text>Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) is a set of telephony signaling protocols developed in the 1970s that is used to setup and teardown telephone calls on most parts of the global public switched telephone network (PSTN). The protocol also performs number translation, local number portability, prepaid billing, Short Message Service (SMS), and other services.

The protocol was introduced in the Bell System in the United States by the name &quot;Common Channel Interoffice Signaling&quot; in the 1970s for signaling between No. 4ESS switch and No. 4A crossbar toll offices. The SS7 protocol is defined for international use by the Q.700-series recommendations of 1988 by the ITU-T. Of the many national variants of the SS7 protocols, most are based on variants standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). National variants with striking characteristics are the Chinese and Japanese Telecommunication Technology Committee (TTC) national variants. 

SS7 has been shown to have several security vulnerabilities, allowing location tracking of callers, interception of voice data, intercept two-factor authentication keys, and possibly the delivery of spyware to phones.

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has defined the SIGTRAN protocol suite that implements levels 2, 3, and 4 protocols compatible with SS7. Sometimes also called &quot;Pseudo SS7&quot;, it is layered on the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) transport mechanism for use on Internet Protocol networks, such as the Internet.

In North America, SS7 is also often referred to as &quot;Common Channel Signaling System 7&quot; (CCSS7) (or CCS7). In the United Kingdom, it is called &quot;C7&quot; (CCITT number 7), &quot;number 7&quot; and &quot;Common Channel Interoffice Signaling 7&quot; (CCIS7). In Germany, it is often called &quot;Zentraler Zeichengabekanal Nummer 7&quot; (ZZK-7).

==History==
Signaling System No. 5 and earlier systems use in-band signaling, in which the call-setup information is sent by generating special multi-frequency tones transmitted on the telephone line audio channels, also known as &quot;bearer channels&quot;. Since the bearer channels are directly accessible by users, they can be exploited with devices such as the blue box, which can replicate the tones used by the network for call control and routing. As a remedy, SS6 and SS7 implements out-of-band signaling, carried in a separate signaling channel, thus keeping the call control and speech paths separate. SS6 and SS7 are referred to as common-channel signaling (CCS) protocols, or &quot;Common Channel Interoffice Signaling&quot; (CCIS) systems.

Another element of in-band signaling addressed by SS7 is network efficiency. With in-band signaling, the voice channel is used during call setup which makes it unavailable for actual traffic. For long-distance calls, the talk path may traverse several nodes which reduces usable node capacity. With SS7, the connection is not established between the end points until all nodes on the path confirm availability. If the far end is busy, the caller gets a busy signal without consuming a voice channel.

Since 1975, CCS protocols have been developed by major telephone companies and the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T); in 1977 the ITU-T defined the first international CCS protocol as Signaling System No. 6 (SS6). In its 1980 Yellow Book Q.7XX-series recommendations ITU-T defined the Signaling System No. 7 as an international standard. SS7 replaced SS6 with its restricted 28-bit signal unit that was both limited in function and not amendable to digital systems. SS7 also replaced Signaling System No. 5 (SS5), while R1 and R2 variants are still used in numerous countries.

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) defined SIGTRAN protocols which translate the common channel signaling paradigm to the IP Message Transfer Part (MTP) level 2 (M2UA and M2PA), Message Transfer Part (MTP) level 3 (M3UA) and Signaling Connection Control Part (SCCP) (SUA). While running on a transport based upon IP, the SIGTRAN protocols are not an SS7 variant, but simply transport existing national and international variants of SS7.

==Functionality==
Signaling in telephony is the exchange of control information associated with the setup and release of a telephone call on a telecommunications circuit. Examples of control information are the digits dialed by the caller and the caller&#x27;s billing number.

When signaling is performed on the same circuit as the conversation of the call, it is termed channel-associated signaling (CAS). This is the case for analogue trunks, multi-frequency (MF) and R2 digital trunks, and DSS1/DASS PBX trunks.

In contrast, SS7 uses common channel signaling, in which the path and facility used by the signaling is separate and distinct from the signaling without first seizing a voice channel, leading to significant savings and performance increases in both signaling and channel usage.

Because of the mechanisms in use by signaling methods prior to SS7 (battery reversal, multi-frequency digit outpulsing, A- and B-bit signaling), these earlier methods cannot communicate much signaling information. Usually only the dialed digits are signaled during call setup. For charged calls, dialed digits and charge number digits are outpulsed. SS7, being a high-speed and high-performance packet-based communications protocol, can communicate significant amounts of information when setting up a call, during the call, and at the end of the call. This permits rich call-related services to be developed. Some of the first such services were call management related, call forwarding (busy and no answer), voice mail, call waiting, conference calling, calling name and number display, call screening, malicious caller identification, busy callback.

The earliest deployed upper-layer protocols in the SS7 suite were dedicated to the setup, maintenance, and release of telephone calls. The Telephone User Part (TUP) was adopted in Europe and the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) User Part (ISUP) adapted for public switched telephone network (PSTN) calls was adopted in North America. ISUP was later used in Europe when the European networks upgraded to the ISDN. North America has not accomplished full upgrade to the ISDN, and the predominant telephone service is still Plain Old Telephone Service. Due to its richness and the need for an out-of-band channel for its operation, SS7 is mostly used for signaling between telephone switches and not for signaling between local exchanges and customer-premises equipment.

Because SS7 signaling does not require seizure of a channel for a conversation prior to the exchange of control information, non-facility associated signaling (NFAS) became possible. NFAS is signaling that is not directly associated with the path that a conversation will traverse and may concern other information located at a centralized database such as service subscription, feature activation, and service logic. This makes possible a set of network-based services that do not rely upon the call being routed to a particular subscription switch at which service logic would be executed, but permits service logic to be distributed throughout the telephone network and executed more expediently at originating switches far in advance of call routing. It also permits the subscriber increased mobility due to the decoupling of service logic from the subscription switch. Another ISUP characteristic SS7 with NFAS enables is the exchange of signaling information during the middle of a call.

SS7 also enables Non-Call-Associated Signaling, which is signaling not directly related to establishing a telephone call. This includes the exchange of registration information used between a mobile telephone and a home location register database, which tracks the location of the mobile. Other examples include Intelligent Network and local number portability databases.

===Signaling modes===
Apart from signaling with these various degrees of association with call set-up and the facilities used to carry calls, SS7 is designed to operate in two modes: &quot;associated mode&quot; and &quot;quasi-associated mode&quot;.

When operating in the &quot;associated mode&quot;, SS7 signaling progresses from switch to switch through the Public Switched Telephone Network following the same path as the associated facilities that carry the telephone call. This mode is more economical for small networks. The associated mode of signaling is not the predominant choice of modes in North America.

When operating in the &quot;quasi-associated mode&quot;, SS7 signaling progresses from the originating switch to the terminating switch, following a path through a separate SS7 signaling network composed of signal transfer points. This mode is more economical for large networks with lightly loaded signaling links. The quasi-associated mode of signaling is the predominant choice of modes in North America.

==Physical network==
SS7 separates signaling from the voice circuits. An SS7 network must be made up of SS7-capable equipment from end to end in order to provide its full functionality. The network can be made up of several link types (A, B, C, D, E, and F) and three signaling nodes – Service Switching Points (SSPs), Signal Transfer Points (STPs), and Service Control Points (SCPs). Each node is identified on the network by a number, a signaling point code. Extended services are provided by a database interface at the SCP level using the SS7 network.

The links between nodes are full-duplex 56, 64, 1,536, or 1,984 kbit/s graded communications channels. In Europe they are usually one (64 kbit/s) or all (1,984 kbit/s) timeslots (DS0s) within an E1 facility; in North America one (56 or 64 kbit/s) or all (1,536 kbit/s) timeslots (DS0As or DS0s) within a T1 facility. One or more signaling links can be connected to the same two endpoints that together form a signaling link set. Signaling links are added to link sets to increase the signaling capacity of the link set.

In Europe, SS7 links normally are directly connected between switching exchanges using F-links. This direct connection is called &quot;associated signaling&quot;. In North America, SS7 links are normally indirectly connected between switching exchanges using an intervening network of STPs (Signaling Transfer Points). This indirect connection is called &quot;quasi-associated signaling&quot;, which reduces the number of SS7 links necessary to interconnect all switching exchanges and SCPs in an SS7 signaling network.

SS7 links at higher signaling capacity (1.536 and 1.984 Mbit/s, simply referred to as the 1.5 Mbit/s and 2.0 Mbit/s rates) are called high-speed links (HSL) in contrast to the low speed (56 and 64 kbit/s) links. High-speed links are specified in ITU-T Recommendation Q.703 for the 1.5 Mbit/s and 2.0 Mbit/s rates, and ANSI Standard T1.111.3 for the 1.536 Mbit/s rate. There are differences between the specifications for the 1.5 Mbit/s rate. High-speed links utilize the entire bandwidth of a T1 (1.536 Mbit/s) or E1 (1.984 Mbit/s) transmission facility for the transport of SS7 signaling messages.

SIGTRAN provides signaling using SCTP associations over the Internet Protocol. The protocols for SIGTRAN are M2PA, M2UA, M3UA and SUA.

==SS7 protocol suite==

The SS7 protocol stack may be partially mapped to the OSI Model of a packetized digital protocol stack. OSI layers 1 to 3 are provided by the Message Transfer Part (MTP) and the Signaling Connection Control Part (SCCP) of the SS7 protocol (together referred to as the Network Service Part (NSP)); for circuit related signaling, such as the BT IUP, Telephone User Part (TUP), or the ISDN User Part (ISUP), the User Part provides layer 7. Currently there are no protocol components that provide OSI layers 4 through 6. The Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) is the primary SCCP User in the Core Network, using SCCP in connectionless mode. SCCP in connection oriented mode provides transport layer for air interface protocols such as BSSAP and RANAP. TCAP provides transaction capabilities to its Users (TC-Users), such as the Mobile Application Part, the Intelligent Network Application Part and the CAMEL Application Part.

The Message Transfer Part (MTP) covers a portion of the functions of the OSI network layer including: network interface, information transfer, message handling and routing to the higher levels. Signaling Connection Control Part (SCCP) is at functional Level 4. Together with MTP Level 3 it is called the Network Service Part (NSP). SCCP completes the functions of the OSI network layer: end-to-end addressing and routing, connectionless messages (UDTs), and management services for users of the Network Service Part (NSP). Telephone User Part (TUP) is a link-by-link signaling system used to connect calls. ISUP is the key user part, providing a circuit-based protocol to establish, maintain, and end the connections for calls. Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) is used to create database queries and invoke advanced network functionality, or links to Intelligent Network Application Part (INAP) for intelligent networks, or Mobile Application Part (MAP) for mobile services.

===BSSAP===
BSS Application Part (BSSAP) is a protocol in SS7 used by the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) and the Base station subsystem (BSS) to communicate with each other using signaling messages supported by the MTP and connection-oriented services of the SCCP. For each active mobile equipment one signaling connection is used by BSSAP having at least one active transactions for the transfer of messages. 

BSSAP provides two kinds of functions:

* The BSS Mobile Application Part (BSSMAP) supports procedures to facilitate communication between the MSC and the BSS pertaining to resource management and handover control.
* The Direct Transfer Application Part (DTAP) is used for transfer of those messages which need to travel directly to mobile equipment from MSC bypassing any interpretation by BSS. These messages are generally pertaining to mobility management (MM) or call management (CM).

==Protocol security vulnerabilities==
In 2008, several SS7 vulnerabilities were published that permitted the tracking of mobile phone users.

In 2014, the media reported a protocol vulnerability of SS7 by which anyone can track the movements of mobile phone users from virtually anywhere in the world with a success rate of approximately 70%. In addition, eavesdropping is possible by using the protocol to forward calls and also facilitate decryption by requesting that each caller&#x27;s carrier release a temporary encryption key to unlock the communication after it has been recorded. The software tool &quot;SnoopSnitch&quot; can warn when certain SS7 attacks occur against a phone, and detect IMSI-catchers that allow call interception and other activities.

In February 2016, 30% of the network of the largest mobile operator in Norway, Telenor, became unstable due to &quot;unusual SS7 signaling from another European operator&quot;.

The security vulnerabilities of SS7 have been highlighted in U.S. governmental bodies, for example when in April 2016 Congressman Ted Lieu called for an oversight committee investigation.

In May 2017, O2 Telefónica, a German mobile service provider, confirmed that the SS7 vulnerabilities had been exploited to bypass two-factor authentication to achieve unauthorized withdrawals from bank accounts. The perpetrators installed malware on compromised computers, allowing them to collect online banking account credentials and telephone numbers. They set up redirects for the victims&#x27; telephone numbers to telephone lines controlled by them. Confirmation calls and SMS text messages of two-factor authentication procedures were routed to telephone numbers controlled by the attackers. This enabled them to log into victims&#x27; online bank accounts and effect money transfers.

In March 2018, a method was published for the detection of the vulnerabilities, through the use of open-source monitoring software such as Wireshark and Snort. The nature of SS7 normally being used between consenting network operators on dedicated links means that any bad actor&#x27;s traffic can be traced to its source.

An investigation by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism revealed that the SS7 protocol was exploited in an attempt to locate Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum (II) on 3 March 2018, a day before her abduction.

In 2024, Kevin Briggs, an official at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, reported to the FCC that hacks related to SS7 and Diameter had been used &quot;numerous attempts&quot; to acquire location data, voice and text messages, deliver spyware, and influence voters in the US. In December 2024, U.S. senator Ron Wyden released information showing that the United States Department of Homeland Security believes China, Russia, Iran, and Israel are the primary countries exploiting SS7 for espionage.

<text>[[Yama]] (Devanagari: यम) is the Hindu deity of death, dharma, the south direction, and the underworld. Belonging to an early stratum of Rigvedic Hindu deities, Yama is said to have been the first mortal who died in the Vedas. By virtue of precedence, he became the ruler of the departed. 

Mentioned in the Pāli Canon of Theravada Buddhism, Yama subsequently entered Buddhist mythology in East Asia, Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka as a Dharmapala. He is also recognized in Sikhism as an angel.

==Background==
Yama is the Hindu god of Death and Justice, and is responsible for the dispensation of law and punishment of sinners in his abode, Naraka. Yama is also one of the oldest deities in the pantheon and some of his earliest appearances are found in the Rigveda. From there, he has remained a significant deity, appearing in some of the most important texts of Hinduism which include the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Puranas&quot;.

Yama is also one of the Lokapalas (guardians of the directions), appointed as the protector of the southern direction. Yama is described as having four arms, protruding fangs, and complexion of storm clouds with a wrathful expression; surrounded by a garland of flames; dressed in red, yellow, or blue garments; riding a water-buffalo and holding a sword, noose and a mace to capture the souls of those who have sinned. Legends describe him as the twin of Yamuna, a river goddess associated with life, and the son of the Sun god Surya and Saranyu. Other than Yamuna, he also has many siblings, such as the Ashvins, Shani, Shraddhadeva Manu, Revanta and Tapati. Some of his major appearances include in the tales of the Pandavas, Savitri Satyavan and the sage Markandeya. His assistant is Chitragupta, another deity associated with death.

==Buddhism==
In Buddhism, Yama is a dharmapala, a wrathful god or the Enlightened Protector of Buddhism that is considered worldly, said to judge the dead and preside over the Narakas (&quot;Hell&quot; or &quot;Purgatory&quot;) and the cycle of rebirth. In the Jātakas the Narakas are mentioned as Yama&#x27;s abode (referred to in Pali as Yamakkhaya, Yamanivesana, Yamasādana, etc.). It is also noted that all of Samsāra is subject to Yama&#x27;s rule, and escape from samsāra means escape from Yama&#x27;s influence.

The Vetaranī River is said to form the boundary of Yama&#x27;s kingdom. Elsewhere, it is referred to as consisting of Ussadaniraya (Pali; Sanskrit: Ussadanaraka), the four woeful planes, or the preta realm.

The Buddhist Yama has, however, developed different myths and different functions from the Hindu deity. In Pali Canon Buddhist myths, Yama takes those who have mistreated elders, holy spirits, or their parents when they die. Contrary though, in the Majjhima Nikaya commentary by Buddhagosa, Yama is a vimānapeta – a preta with occasional suffering.

In other parts of Buddhism, Yama&#x27;s main duty is to watch over purgatorial aspects of Hell (the underworld), and has no relation to rebirth. His sole purpose is to maintain the relationships between spirits that pass through the ten courts, similar to Yama&#x27;s representation in several Chinese religions.

He has also spread widely and is known in every country where Buddhism is practiced, including China, Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Bhutan, Mongolia, Nepal, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos.
=== China ===
In Chinese Buddhism, Yama is regarded as one of the &quot;Twenty Devas&quot; ( &quot;Èrshí Zhūtiān&quot;) or the &quot;Twenty-Four Devas&quot; ( &quot;Èrshísì zhūtiān&quot;), a group of protective dharmapalas consisting of devas adopted from Hinduism and Taoism. His statue is usually enshrined in the Mahavira halls of Chinese Buddhist temples along with the statues of the other devas.

In Chinese texts, Yama only holds transitional places in Hell where he oversaw the deceased before he, and the Generals of Five Paths, were assigned a course of rebirth. Yama was later placed as a King in the Fifth Court when texts led to the fruition of the underworld that marked the beginnings of systemizations.

The Chinese concept of &quot;Diyu&quot; (, Japanese: &quot;Jigoku&quot;, Korean: &quot;Jiok&quot;, ) literally &quot;earth prison&quot;, is the realm of the dead or Hell in Chinese mythology and Japanese mythology. It is based upon the Buddhist concept of Naraka combined with local afterlife beliefs. Incorporating ideas from Taoism and Buddhism as well as traditional religion in China, Di Yu is a kind of purgatory place which serves not only to punish but also to renew spirits ready for their next incarnation. This is interchangeable with the concept of Naraka.

=== Japan ===
Yama can be found in one of the oldest Japanese religious works called Nipponkoku Genpō Zen&#x27;aku Ryōiki, a literary work compiled by the Monk Keikai in 822. Yama was introduced to Japan through Buddhism, where he was featured as a Buddhist divinity. He holds the same position title as other works depict him – a judge who imposes decisions on the dead who have mistreated others.

In Japanese mythology, Enma-O(閻魔王) or Enma Dai-O (閻魔大王:, &quot;Great King Enma&quot;) judges souls in Meido, the kingdom of the waiting dead. Those deemed too horrible are sent to Jigoku, a land more comparable to the Christian hell. It is a land of eternal toil and punishment. Those of middle note remain in meido for a period awaiting reincarnation. Others, of high note, become honored ancestors, watching over their descendants.

In the Buddhism of the Far East, Yama is one of the twelve Devas, as guardian deities, who are found in or around Buddhist shrines (&quot;Jūni-ten&quot;, ). In Japan, he has been called &quot;Enma-Ten&quot;. He joins these other eleven Devas of Buddhism, found in Japan and other parts of southeast Asia: Indra (Taishaku-ten), Agni (Ka-ten), Yama (Emma-ten), Nirrti (Rasetsu-ten), Vayu (Fu-ten), Ishana (Ishana-ten), Kubera (Tamon-ten), Varuna (Sui-ten) Brahma (Bon-ten), Prithvi (Chi-ten), Surya (Nit-ten), Chandra (Gat-ten).

== Sikhism ==
In Sikhism, Yamaraja is referred to as Dharam Rai, Dharam Raj and Dharam Raja (in which, dharma is spelt as dharam instead). In Sikhism, Dharam Rai is considered to be a servant of God instead of a god, who works for God. It is believed that God had seated Dharam Rai with the task of reading out the being&#x27;s deeds after the being dies and then assigns them into heaven or hell accordingly. 

The idea of Naraka in Sikhism is the equivalent of Hell. Naraka is a place where sinners are punished. Each sin has a particular punishment. For a lustful person, there is a door to a fire chamber. There is a doorway for those who had listened to other people&#x27;s gossip. They are punished by having red hot liquid iron poured into their ears. Liars have their tongues cut off. Thieves have their hands cut off.

After the perhaps being has spent time in heaven or hell accordingly, then they are assigned to re-enter the 8.4 million life-form cycle again in which they will reincarnate through various lifeforms until they re-attain the human life again. Some Sikhs interpret Dharam Raj literally, however, there are many interpretations where Dharam Raj is representative of the role of the divine judge of actions. The imagery of Yama would have been used in order to explain such a concept to followers of the Sikh Gurus who came from Hindu backgrounds: there is also imagery of the Islamic angel of death that was also used to help followers from Islamic backgrounds. Sikhism does not focus all that much on any type of mythology, and rather believes that all mythologies are creations of Waheguru: thus there is not a large focus on them and their details, as Waheguru is the only being to be worshipped. Thus, within the doctrine of Sikhism, Yama represents a divine judge who reads records of people&#x27;s actions: references to him are more conceptual, rather than the more literal depiction of him in Hindu scripture

Those souls who merge into God, become God, and attain full enlightenment or salvation (known as Moksha and Nirvana) will not be judged by Dharam Rai and will go into another heaven known as Sach Khand.

Also, Dharam Rai is referred to as &#x27;The Righteous Judge of Dharma&#x27; in the English translation of the Sikh scriptures. Dharam Rai also has assistants that assist him.

Mentions of Yamaraja (known as Dharam Rai in Sikhism) in the Sikh scriptures:

&quot;O Nanak, having created the souls, the Lord installed the Righteous Judge of Dharma to read and record their accounts. There, only the Truth is judged true; the sinners are picked out and separated. The false find no place there, and they go to hell with their faces blackened. Those who are imbued with Your Name win, while the cheaters lose. The Lord installed the Righteous Judge of Dharma to read and record the accounts. ||2||&quot;
(Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Maharaj, Ang 463)

&quot;The Righteous Judge of Dharma, by the Hukam of God&#x27;s Command, sits and administers True Justice. Those evil souls, ensnared by the love of duality, are subject to Your Command. The souls on their spiritual journey chant and meditate within their minds on the One Lord, the Treasure of Excellence. The Righteous Judge of Dharma serves them; blessed is the Lord who adorns them. ||2||&quot;
(Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Maharaj, Ang 38 and 39)

&quot;The Righteous Judge of Dharma is a creation of the Lord; he does not approach the humble servant of the Lord.&quot;
(Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Maharaj, Ang 555)

&quot;Remembering the Lord in meditation, you shall not be punished by the Messenger of Death. The couriers of the Righteous Judge of Dharma shall not touch you.&quot;
(Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Maharaj, Ang 185)

&quot;The Messenger of Death and the Righteous Judge of Dharma do not even approach the beloved servant of my Lord and Master. ||6||&quot;
(Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Maharaj, Ang 980)

== In Javanese culture ==
There is a door-god Yamadipati in Javanese culture, preserved especially in wayang. The word &quot;adipati&quot; means &quot;ruler&quot; or &quot;commander&quot;. When Hinduism first came to Java, Yama was still the same as Yama in Hindu myth. Later, as Islam replaced Hinduism as the majority religion of Java, Yama was demystified by Walisanga, who ruled at that time. So, in Javanese, Yama became a new character. He is the son of Sanghyang Ismaya and Dewi Sanggani. In the Wayang legend, Yamadipati married Dewi Mumpuni. Unfortunately, Dewi Mumpuni fell in love with Nagatatmala, son of Hyang Anantaboga, who rules the earth. Dewi Mumpuni eventually left Yamadipati, however.

== In Iranian mythology ==

In the &quot;Zend-Avesta&quot; of Zoroastrianism, a parallel character is called &quot;Yima&quot;.
The pronunciation &quot;Yima&quot; is peculiar to the Avestan dialect; in most Iranian dialects, including Old Persian, the name would have been &quot;Yama&quot;. In the Avesta, the emphasis is on Yima&#x27;s character as one of the first mortals and as a great king of men. Over time, *Yamaxšaita was transformed into Jamšēd or Jamshid, celebrated as the greatest of the early shahs of the world.
Both Yamas in Zoroastrian and Hindu myth guard hell with the help of two four-eyed dogs.

It has also been suggested by I. M. Steblin-Kamensky that the cult of Yima was adopted by the Finno-Ugrians. According to this theory, in Finnish Yama became the god cult Jumula and Joma in Komi. According to this hypothesis, from this cult, the Hungarians also borrowed the word vara which became vár &#x27;fortress&#x27; and város &#x27;town&#x27;. (ibid)

== In Kalasha culture ==
Yama is also an important deity worshipped by the Kalasha and formerly by the Nuristani peoples, indicating his prominence in Hinduism. There is a Chitral district by the Chitral river in the Swat (Suvastu) region in the north-western Indian subcontinent. The languages spoken amongst others are Chitrali and Kalash. To note is the fact that even in the remaining currently practised form of ancient Hinduism in the region, certain deities were revered either in one community/tribe or other. Only one was universally revered as the Creator that is the ancient Hindu god Yamarâja called &quot;Imr&#x27;o&quot; in Kâmviri. The ancient region had historical and cultural links to the nearby regions of Gilgit-Baltistan, Kashmir and Nuristan.

<text>Sir John Pentland Mahaffy (26 February 1839 – 30 April 1919) was an Irish classicist and polymathic scholar who served as the 34th Provost of Trinity College Dublin from 1914 to 1919.

==Early life and education==
He was born near Vevey in Switzerland on 26 February 1839, to Irish parents, Nathaniel Brindley Mahaffy and the former Elizabeth Pentland, receiving his early education privately in Switzerland and Germany, and later and more formally at Trinity College Dublin. As an undergraduate, he became President of the University Philosophical Society. He was elected a scholar in 1857, graduated in classics and philosophy in 1859, and was elected a fellow in 1864.

==Academic career==
Mahaffy held a chair in Ancient History at Trinity from 1871, and eventually became Provost in 1914, at the age of 75. He was a distinguished classicist and papyrologist as well as a Doctor of Music. He wrote the music for the Grace in chapel. Mahaffy, a man of great versatility, published numerous works across a range of subjects, some of which, especially those dealing with the &#x27;Silver Age&#x27; of Greece, became standard authorities.

He was High Sheriff of County Monaghan for 1900 and a Justice of the Peace for county Dublin. He was President of the Royal Irish Academy from 1911 to 1916.

==Famous wit==
He was regarded as one of Dublin&#x27;s great curmudgeons and also one of its greatest wits. When aspiring to be Provost of Trinity College, upon hearing that the incumbent was ill, he is said to have remarked, &quot;Nothing trivial, I hope?&quot; In his academic years, perhaps his most notable student was Oscar Wilde, with whom he discussed homosexuality in ancient Greece, and with whom he also collaborated in writing Mahaffy&#x27;s book &quot;Social Life in Greece&quot;. Although he later expressed reservations about Mahaffy, Wilde nonetheless described him as &quot;my first and best teacher&quot; and &quot;the scholar who showed me how to love Greek things&quot;. When Wilde went on to achieve fame and success, Mahaffy boasted of having created him, only to later describe Wilde as &quot;the only blot on my tutorship&quot;. Like his protégés, Wilde and Oliver Gogarty, Mahaffy was a brilliant conversationalist, coming out with such gems as &quot;in Ireland the inevitable never happens and the unexpected constantly occurs.&quot; When asked, by an advocate of women&#x27;s rights, what the difference was between a man and a woman he replied, &quot;I can&#x27;t conceive.&quot; He was apparently opposed to Irish Catholics accessing higher education; Gerald Griffin records Mahaffy as saying &quot;James Joyce is a living argument in defence of my contention that it was a mistake to establish a separate university for the aborigines of this island – for the corner boys who spit into the Liffey.&quot;

Politically, Mahaffy was a staunch unionist who in 1899 tried to have the Irish language removed from the national Intermediate curriculum on the grounds that there was no literature in the language that was not &quot;religious, immoral or indecent&quot;. In 1914, he suppressed the university&#x27;s Gaelic Society when it proposed to mark the centenary of the birth of Thomas Osborne Davis with a gathering that was to be addressed by Patrick Pearse, who at the time was campaigning against the recruitment of Irish soldiers to serve in the British armed forces during World War I, whereas Mahaffy was vigorously in favour of all possible support for the British war effort. Additionally, Mahaffy was greatly worried by the prospect of the partition of Ireland, and during the Irish Convention of 1917-18, he proposed a federalist Home Rule arrangement in Ireland, based on the Swiss cantons’ model, with parliaments in each of the provinces sending representatives to a central assembly.

Mahaffy also had a reputation as a snob. For instance, he had a great admiration for the nobility and would often prefer the company of dukes and kings. When he moved into Earlscliffe (a house on the Hill of Howth, County Dublin) as his summer residence, a wag at the time suggested that maybe it had better be renamed Dukescliffe.

Curmudgeon and snob though he could undoubtedly be, Mahaffy was also capable of great and spontaneous kindness, as is evident from the instance of the schoolboy whom Mahaffy came upon near the Hill of Howth, where the boy was reading Greek. Mahaffy asked him about his studies, later lent him books to assist him, and eventually saw to it that the young man was admitted free of charge to read Classics at Trinity College Dublin.

==Personal life==
Mahaffy&#x27;s paternal ancestry could be traced back to the south of County Donegal, where his great-grandfather owned land. His grandfather and father were also Church of Ireland clergymen.

In 1865, Mahaffy married Frances Letitia MacDougall (d. 1908), by whom he had two daughters, Rachel Mary (d. 1944) and Elsie (d. 1926), and two sons, Arthur William (d. 1919) and Robert Pentland (d. 1943). He travelled widely, to destinations such as Egypt, Nubia, Greece and the United States of America. Despite his ordination as a clergyman, he was knighted in 1918, shortly before his death.

His interests were not confined to academia: he shot and played cricket for Ireland, and claimed to know the pedigree of every racehorse in Ulster. He was also an expert fly fisherman. He was also instrumental in setting up a Georgian Society for the appreciation of Irish Georgian architecture; this functioned from 1908 to 1913.

In 1889, with his friend James Edward Rogers Mahaffy published &quot;Sketches from a tour through Holland and Germany&quot;.

The memory of many of Mahaffy&#x27;s accomplishments was preserved thanks to the efforts of R. B. McDowell, who together with W. B. Stanford published &quot;Mahaffy: A Biography of an Anglo-Irishman&quot; (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1971).
Mahaffy had a Dublin townhouse at 38 North Great George&#x27;s Street and another overlooking Dublin bay at Sealawn in Sutton, Dublin.

==Bibliography==

In a generally scathing review, Wilde remarks: &quot;in his attempts to treat the Hellenic world as ‘Tipperary writ large,’ to use Alexander the Great as a means of whitewashing Mr. Smith, and to finish the battle of Chæronea on the plains of Mitchelstown, Mr. Mahaffy shows an amount of political bias and literary blindness that is quite extraordinary.&quot;

<doc id="100110" wikidata="Q1079349" url="?curid=100110" title="Symmetric digital subscriber line">
<text>A symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL) is a digital subscriber line (DSL) that transmits digital data over the copper wires of the telephone network, where the bandwidth in the downstream direction, from the network to the subscriber, is identical to the bandwidth in the upstream direction, from the subscriber to the network. This symmetric bandwidth can be considered to be the opposite of the asymmetric bandwidth offered by asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) technologies, where the upstream bandwidth is lower than the downstream bandwidth. SDSL is generally marketed at business customers, while ADSL is marketed at private as well as business customers.

More specifically, SDSL can be understood as:
* &quot;In the wider sense&quot;, an umbrella term for all DSL variant which offer symmetric bandwidth, including IDSL, which offers 144 kbit/s, HDSL, HDSL2, G.SHDSL, which offers up to 22.784 Mbit/s over four pairs of copper wires, as well as the SDSL variant below
* &quot;In the narrow sense&quot;, a particular proprietary and non-standardized DSL variant for operation at 1.544 Mbit/s or 2.048 Mbit/s over a single pair of copper wires, without support for analog calls on the same line
* A term used by ETSI to refer to G.SHDSL

== Proprietary SDSL technology ==
SDSL is a rate-adaptive digital subscriber line (DSL) variant with T1/E1-like data rates (T1: 1.544 Mbit/s, E1: 2.048 Mbit/s). It runs over one pair of copper wires, with a maximum range of . It cannot co-exist with a conventional voice service on the same pair as it takes over the entire bandwidth.

===Standardization efforts===
SDSL is a proprietary technology that was never standardized. As such it usually only interoperates with devices from the same vendor. It is the predecessor of G.SHDSL which was standardized in February 2001 by ITU-T with recommendation G.991.2. SDSL is often confused with G.SHDSL and HDSL; in Europe, G.SHDSL was standardized by ETSI using the name &#x27;SDSL&#x27;. This ETSI variant is compatible with the ITU-T G.SHDSL standardized regional variant for Europe.

As there is a standardised successor available, SDSL installations today are considered legacy. Most new installations use G.SHDSL equipment instead of SDSL.

===Target audience===
SDSL typically falls between ADSL and T1/E1 in price and was mainly targeted at small and medium businesses which don&#x27;t need the service guarantees of Frame Relay or the higher performance of a leased line.

<doc id="100113" wikidata="Q555578" url="?curid=100113" title="Chespirito">
<text>Roberto Mario Gómez Bolaños (21 February 1929 – 28 November 2014), more commonly known by his stage name Chespirito, or &quot;Little Shakespeare&quot;, was a Mexican actor, comedian, screenwriter, humorist, director, producer, and author. He is widely regarded as one of the icons of Spanish-speaking humor and entertainment and one of the greatest comedians of all time. He is also one of the most loved and respected comedians in Latin America. He is mostly known by his acting role Chavo from the sitcom &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot;.

He is recognized all over the planet for writing, directing, and starring in the &quot;Chespirito&quot; (1970–1973, 1980–1995), &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot; (1973–1980), and &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot; (1973–1979) television series. The character of &quot;El Chavo&quot; is one of the most iconic in the history of Latin American television, and &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot; continues to be immensely popular, with daily worldwide viewership averaging 91 million viewers .

==Early life==
He was born in Mexico City on 21 February 1929 to Catholic parents. He was the second child of Francisco Gómez Linares, a painter and illustrator, who died at the age of 41 in 1935. His mother, Elsa Bolaños Aguilar, was a bilingual secretary; she died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 66 in 1968. Elsa was the youngest child of Ramón Bolaños Cacho, a military doctor, and his Zacatecas-born wife, María Aguilar. Via his mother, Bolaños was a first cousin once removed of the President of Mexico from 1964 to 1970, Gustavo Díaz Ordaz. He had an older brother called Francisco (1926–2010), and a younger brother called Horacio Gómez Bolaños, who portrayed the character Godínez in &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot;, and an even older half-brother born of one of his father&#x27;s liaisons.

Before becoming an actor, Bolaños was an amateur boxer. He studied mechanical engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), but he never came to practice that profession. Before he became famous, he wrote a number of plays, contributed dialogue to Mexican film and television scripts, and secured some character-acting work. &quot;Chespirito&quot; was of short stature; his stage name was the Spanish phonetic pronunciation of William Shakespeare &quot;Chespir&quot; (pronounced &quot;shespir&quot;) with diminutive suffix -&quot;ito&quot;. Between 1960 and 1965 he dedicated himself to writing scripts for &quot;Comedians and songs&quot; and &quot;El estudio de Pedro Vargas&quot;, which were the two programs with the highest audience in Mexico.

==Career==

Chespirito was discovered as an actor while waiting in line to apply for a job as a writer; soon he began writing and starring in his children&#x27;s comedy shows. Chespirito&#x27;s first show was &quot;Los Supergenios de la Mesa Cuadrada&quot;, a sketch comedy show that premiered in 1968; the show also starred Ramón Valdés, María Antonieta de las Nieves, and Rubén Aguirre. &quot;Los Supergenios&quot; was later renamed &quot;Chespirito y la Mesa Cuadrada&quot; and later &quot;Chespirito&quot;. The characters &quot;El Chavo&quot;, &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Chapatín&quot; were introduced on this show (1972, 1970 and 1968 respectively).

===&quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot; and &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot;===

His best known roles were in the shows &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot; and &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot;. Both series premiered in 1973 and were based on sketches of the same name from &quot;Los Supergenios&quot;. The shows were produced by Mexican TV network Televisa and aired in 124 countries. Other shows produced by and starring Chespirito were the short-lived &quot;La Chicharra&quot; from 1979 and a second version of &quot;Chespirito&quot; from 1980 to 1995.

In &quot;El Chavo,&quot; Chespirito played an 8-year-old boy who often took refuge inside a wooden rain barrel in a Mexican neighborhood, and in &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot; he played a good-hearted superhero who gets involved in humorous situations. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening has said that he created the Bumblebee Man character after watching &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot; in a motel on the Mexico–United States border.

&quot;El Chavo&quot; and &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot; have become cultural icons all over Latin America and have aired in many countries worldwide.

Roberto Gómez Bolaños was also noted as a composer. He started writing music as a hobby, and most of his early musical work was related to his comedy work, featured particularly in occasional &quot;Chapulín Colorado&quot; or &quot;Chavo del Ocho&quot; special episodes. Later works include the theme songs for various Mexican movies and telenovelas, such as &quot;Alguna Vez Tendremos Alas&quot; and &quot;La Dueña&quot;. He is also the creator of the theater comedy &quot;Once y Doce&quot; (&quot;Eleven and Twelve&quot;), the most successful theater comedy in Mexican history; it is still played occasionally.

==Works by Chespirito==
*&quot;Los Supergenios de la Mesa Cuadrada&quot; (1968–1973), renamed &quot;Chespirito y la Mesa Cuadrada&quot; in 1970 and &quot;Chespirito&quot; in 1971.
*&quot;El Ciudadano Gómez&quot; (1968–1969; 1973; 1994–1995), a parody of Citizen Kane.

*&quot;Dr. Chapatín&quot; (1968–1979; 1980–1995), one of the presenters of &quot;Los Supergenios&quot; who starred in sketches in the show, also appeared in the &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot; half-hour show of 1973–1979. He represents an old doctor who constantly has fights and confusions due to his old age and hitting people with a paper bag whose contents were never revealed in-sketch. In an interview, Chespirito revealed that Dr. Chapatín carried in his bag all the bad feelings of the people, which is why it hurt a lot. Dr. Chapatín&#x27;s character did a small cameo in the movies &quot;El Chanfle&quot;, &quot;El Chanfle 2&quot;,&quot;Don Ratón y Don Ratero&quot;, and &quot;El Charrito&quot;.
*&quot;Chespirito (character)&quot; (1968–1975; 1980–1986; 1991–1992; 1994–1995), occasionally starred in sketches of the &quot;Los Supergenios&quot; as a &quot;character&quot;.
*&quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot; (1970–1973; 1973–1979; 1980–1993), second most successful character of Bolaños; became a weekly half-hour show in 1973. A naive but brave superhero who always tries to help people in problems. 
*&quot;Los Chifladitos&quot; (1970–1972; 1980–1995), starred alongside Rubén Aguirre, one of the main sketches of the &quot;Los Supergenios&quot; until Aguirre left the show. Chespirito did Chaparron Bonaparte and Aguirre, Lucas Tañeda, as a pair of demented characters who ran in several confusions by the use of puns and the unexpected convulsions of Chaparron called &quot;Chiripiorcas&quot;.
*&quot;Los Caquitos&quot; (1970–1975; 1980–1995) became the third most successful creation of Bolaños; sketches were created until 1975. Originally they were Chespirito as &quot;Chómpiras&quot; and Ramón Valdés as &quot;Peterete&quot;. In the sketches of the 80s, Édgar Vivar took the place of Valdés, playing a new character named &quot;El Botija&quot;, while Florinda Meza got a new character for the sketches as &quot;La Chimoltrufia&quot;, Botija&#x27;s wife. It became Chespirito&#x27;s main act in the last years of his program due to him being too old to perform his other characters.
*&quot;Los Chiripiojos&quot; (1972), is the family La Chimoltrufia.
*&quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot; (1971–1973; 1973–1980; 1980–1992), created as immediate successor of &quot;Los Chifladitos&quot;; become a weekly half-hour show in 1973. Is about a poor kid who lives in a small neighborhood with other families who share comic situations. It&#x27;s Chespirito&#x27;s most successful character.
*&quot;La Chicharra&quot; (1979–1982), half-hour show that replaced &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot; in 1979. He tried to create something new with a newspaper reporter who happens to take the wrong news in the wrong place. The show&#x27;s lead character, Vicente Chambon, originally appeared as part of &quot;Chespirito&quot; in its early days.
*&quot;Don Calavera&quot; (1994–1995), the nickname of Carlos Vera, a mortician who likes to flirt with widows, is the last character created by Chespirito, appears only in the 1980–1995 version of the &quot;Chespirito&quot; show.

==Later years==
On 19 November 2004, after 27 years together, he married actress and longtime companion Florinda Meza, who starred as Doña Florinda in &quot;El Chavo&quot;. After show production was stopped for &quot;El Chavo&quot; and &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot;, both toured Mexico and the rest of Latin America and the United States with different plays, sometimes playing the characters who made them famous. In 2003, &quot;Chespirito&quot; and Florinda Meza received the keys to the town of Cicero, Illinois.

During Mexico&#x27;s presidential campaigns of 2000 and 2006 he openly supported the National Action Party (PAN) by appearing in TV commercials and urging people to vote for the party&#x27;s candidates, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón. For the 2012 race, he made public that he would vote for the Partido Accion Nacional (PAN) candidate, Josefina Vázquez Mota, but did not appear in a commercial. In 2007, he joined a campaign led by Catholics and conservatives against the legalization of abortion in Mexico City.

He shared that while pregnant with him, his mother suffered an accident and the doctor advised her to get an abortion; she refused. He also wrote the books &quot;El Diario de El Chavo del Ocho&quot; (&quot;Diary From the Kid from Number 8&quot;), &quot;...Y También Poemas&quot; (&quot;...And Poems Too&quot;), and &quot;Sin Querer Queriendo: Memorias&quot; (&quot;Accidentally on Purpose: Memoirs&quot;). In 2009, he was also honored by the Colombian TV-channel RCN in which he received the keys of the municipality of Soacha; more than 20,000 people attended the homage. On 12 November 2009, he was admitted to a Mexico City hospital due to prostate complications, which required a simple surgery to treat. He was released from treatment the following day.

On 29 February 2012, a celebration of Chespirito&#x27;s life and work was held at the Auditorio Nacional. The special, titled &quot;América celebra a Chespirito&quot;, was a multinational tribute that gathered a diverse group of actors, singers, and fans from 17 nations. They included Armando Manzanero, Thalía, Ximena Navarrete, Marco Antonio Regil, Juan Gabriel, Diego Verdaguer, Gian Marco, Pandora, Reik, and OV7. Chespirito&#x27;s ill health was apparent: he was in a wheelchair, required oxygen tanks, and could not stay the entire program. Nonetheless, he expressed great emotion and gratitude for the tribute. The special was broadcast across the participating nations on 11 March.

Over Twitter, Chespirito denounced the actions of the Yo Soy 132 movement after the takeover of Televisa Chapultepec following the 2012 election. In 2012, Chespirito was honored by his friends and former cast members, putting an end to many rumors that the comedian was dying. Even so, former colleagues such as Édgar Vivar expressed their concern publicly for Chespirito&#x27;s poor health.

==Death==
At 2:30 PM (19:30 GMT) on Friday, 28 November 2014, Chespirito died from heart failure as a complication of Parkinson&#x27;s disease at the age of 85, in his home in Cancún, Quintana Roo, Mexico. Many Mexican celebrities and Chespirito&#x27;s former co-stars took to Twitter to express their feelings and send their condolences to Chespirito&#x27;s widow and family. Such celebrities and former co-stars included George Lopez, Eugenio Derbez, Carlos Villagrán, Édgar Vivar, Rubén Aguirre, and María Antonieta de las Nieves. Chespirito is widely regarded as one of the most renowned Spanish-language comedians of the 20th century.

On 1 December 2014, he was buried at the Panteón Francés in Mexico City, following a private funeral on Saturday and a public one held on Sunday at Estadio Azteca, attended by about 40,000 fans. His widow does not permit fans to visit his tomb. A private security guard is there along with a security camera at all times.

==Legacy==

Chespirito has been described as one of the most recognized Mexican comedians of the 20th century as well as being well known and honored in all of Latin America. He has been honored for his creative writing, characters, comedic pick-up lines, and for his clean humor style. His TV shows have been made into cartoons since 2006 (&quot;El Chavo Animado&quot;, with some other Chespirito characters appearing in the show). The animated show has been translated into English, Portuguese, and French. An animated TV show based on another famous Chespirito character, &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot;, was announced in 2015. It aired the first episode online on 13 April.

=== Tributes ===
In 2000, Televisa gave him a tribute entitled &quot;No contaban con mi astucia,&quot; commemorating the thirty-year anniversary of the humorous program &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot;. In 2004, the Art Chroniclers Association (ACROARTE) of the Dominican Republic and the National Dominican Brewery awarded him the Soberano Award in recognition of his career in Latin American television and his many facets as a writer, screenwriter, actor, comedian and producer. In 2012, there was a tribute called América celebra a Chespirito also made by Televisa, with the popular singer Thalía performing a song written by Gian Marco Zignago. The Google Doodle of 21 February 2020, honored Chespirito.

== Controversies ==
In 2000 and 2006, Roberto Gómez Bolaños participated in television advertisements supporting the electoral campaigns of the National Action Party. In 2006, he also wrote a letter to then-candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador, asking him not to divide Mexicans. 

In April 2007, he joined the claim of Catholic and conservative groups that were fighting to maintain abortion as a crime in the Federal District, against the position of the Legislative Assembly, whose representatives were inclined to decriminalize it during the first twelve weeks of gestation. Gómez Bolaños participated in television propaganda against the new law. He is known for comments on Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot; painting, such as those made at the beginning of May 2007, in Colombia, where he declared that the work &quot;is a caricature.&quot;

When asked who had been the best president of Mexico, Chespirito replied: &quot;Gustavo Díaz Ordaz in some things and not because he was my uncle, whom nobody wanted. Before 1968, he was the best president, and if we look at the numbers of the inflation that Mexico experienced is justified. Then, Salinas, although he had not won, but he was extremely intelligent. And the same thing happens with Fox, his figures are better after Díaz Ordaz pa&#x27;cá. Now, the most accurate answer I can give is: none.&quot;

Fernando Rodríguez Mondragón, son of Colombian drug lord Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela, head of the extinct Cali Cartel in Colombia and author of the book &quot;El hijo del ajedrecista&quot;, pointed out that Roberto Gómez Bolaños performed at a party for one of the sons of the heads of the aforementioned cartel. Given this information, Gómez Bolaños&#x27; immediate response was that he had never been linked to drug trafficking in any of its forms, but María Antonieta de las Nieves assured that &quot;El show de Chespirito&quot; was presented at the celebration of a first communion for the family of the drug dealer.

=== Accusations of support for dictatorships ===
According to &quot;El Financiero&quot;, Roberto Gómez Bolaños was severely criticized for traveling to South American nations that were under the yoke of dictators such as Jorge Rafael Videla in Argentina, and Augusto Pinochet in Chile. Eduardo Bautista wrote that &quot;According to the comedian himself, the cast of &quot;El Chavo&quot; visited all the countries of the continent, [...] The case most criticized by the Mexican media was, perhaps; that of 1978, when Chespirito traveled to Santiago, the Chilean capital, during Pinochet&#x27;s regime,&quot; appearing at the Chilean National Stadium, where he had a record audience of 80,000. On the other hand, at the Quinta Vergara stage during the Viña del Mar Festival, &quot;thousands of fans also attended, who even had to be accommodated in the surrounding mountainous areas, as the place had exceeded its quota.&quot;

Gómez Bolaños received negative criticism from the Mexican press for having appeared at the National Stadium, a place that had been used as a concentration camp. Bolaños did not respond to these accusations until 2005 in the book &quot;Sin querer queriendo&quot;, he clarified that &quot;none of the actors was aware that the stadium had been a concentration camp&quot; and that, had they known it, &quot;we would have worked there anyway&quot;. He goes on to say that, according to that logic, &quot;no actor should present themselves in the Zócalo where the memory of all those who were murdered during the Ten Tragic Days was muddied&quot;. The comedian also expressed his happiness for having performed at the National Stadium: &quot;How can we forget the long standing ovation that they gave us while we did an Olympic lap twice, even though we ended up puffing with exhaustion? It was worth it, wasn&#x27;t it?&quot;.

=== Legal Issues with Maria Antonieta De Las Nieves ===

In July 2013, Maria Antonieta announced that she finally won a lawsuit against Chespirito, backed by Televisa which began in 2001 for the misuse of her character &quot;La Chilindrina&quot;. &quot;You have the scoop of knowing that I have already won the lawsuit against Televisa and Chespirito. Chilindrina is already mine and no one can take her away from me,&quot; De Las Nieves said at a press conference in Lima, the capital of Peru. According to the American-Mexican media Univision, on 26 July 2013, Gomez Bolaños told them that &quot;the day El Chavo ended, everyone did whatever they wanted with their character, that&#x27;s how I wanted to do it. I said I was going to continue, he said yes, but later he regretted it and said no.&quot; Unlike Carlos Villagran who left the show in 1978, Maria Antonieta stayed on the show until the late-1990s.

=== Series stopped all airings ===
On 31 July 2020, all TV channels and streaming services that broadcast any of Chespirito&#x27;s series announced that they were no longer broadcasting it from the next day on. Currently, the reason they gave was because the contract expired that day, and Televisa (owner of the series) didn&#x27;t update it due to revenue disputes with Grupo Chespirito (owner of all episode scripts and almost all characters).

Currently, the only exception to this rule is &quot;El Chavo: The Animated Series&quot; broadcasting in Brazil, being still broadcast on SBT via the block and still available locally on Amazon Prime Video.

=== Series resumes some airings ===
On 7 September 2024, it was announced by Florinda Meza on Twitter/X that &quot;El Chavo&quot; and &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot; would be returning to television after a four year absence. Both shows would be returning to UniMas and Univision, and streaming on Vix beginning 21 September 2024. The show would return to Las Estrellas in Mexico a month later.

<doc id="100115" wikidata="Q11815679" url="?curid=100115" title="Perinthus">
<text>Perinthus or Perinthos () was a great and flourishing town of ancient Thrace, situated on the Propontis. According to John Tzetzes, it bore at an early period the name of Mygdonia (Μυγδονία). It lay west of Selymbria and west of Byzantium, on a small peninsula of the bay which bears its name, and was built like an amphitheatre, on the declivity of a hill. Its site is near modern Marmara Ereğlisi, in Turkey.

== History ==

It was originally a Samian colony, and, according to George Syncellus, was founded about 599 BC. German archaeologist Theodor Panofka, however, makes it contemporary with Samothrace, that is about 1000 BC. It was particularly renowned for its obstinate defence against Philip II of Macedon. At that time it appears to have been a more important and flourishing town even than Byzantium and being both a harbour and a point at which several main roads met, it was the seat of extensive commerce. This circumstance explains the reason why so many of its coins are still extant from which we learn that large and celebrated festivals were held here.
After the fourth century AD it assumed the name of Heraclea or Heracleia (Ἡράκλεια); which we find sometimes used alone, and sometimes with additions Heraclea Thraciae and Heraclea Perinthus.

Septimius Severus (r. 193–211) twice granted the city the prestigious title of &quot;neokoros&quot; and gave it permission to hold crown festivals in his honor, in recognition of its support during his conflict with Pescennius Niger, a rival claimant to the Roman throne. 

Justinian restored the old imperial palace, and the aqueducts of the city. Coins of Perinthus have also survived, which were studied by Edith Schönert-Geiß. The inscriptions from Perinthus and the literary testimonia on the city have been collected by Mustafa Hamdi Sayar.

== Cityscape ==

The peninsula and acropolis were complemented by the landward lower city and its walls, some remains of which have been found.

Other notable places include the 5th-century basilica which in its architecture seems to be closely linked to the church designs of Constantinople. The floor mosaics are particularly well made and preserved. 

Stone from the basilica seems to have been used in the construction of a tower meant to guard a 1.9m wide secondary gate, from which may be deduced that the basilica must have been destroyed some time prior, though the date for that is not certain. Archaeologists and historians from the Tekirdağ Museum, the University of Istanbul and the University of Heidelberg think the church might have stood for no more than perhaps 150 years. It was never rebuilt and instead replaced with a small chapel.

<doc id="100117" wikidata="Q949917" url="?curid=100117" title="Marvin the Martian">
<text>Marvin the Martian is an extraterrestrial character from the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series. He frequently appears as a villain in cartoons and video games, and wears a Roman soldier&#x27;s helmet and skirt. The character has been voiced by Mel Blanc, Joe Alaskey, Bob Bergen and Eric Bauza, among others.

The character first appeared as an antagonist in the 1948 Bugs Bunny cartoon &quot;Haredevil Hare&quot;. He went on to appear in four more cartoons produced between 1952 and 1963.

==Conception and creation==
Marvin&#x27;s design was based on the Hoplite style of armor, usually worn by the Roman god Mars. &quot;That was the uniform that Mars wore — that helmet and skirt. We thought putting it on this ant-like creature might be funny. But since he had no mouth, we had to convey that he was speaking totally through his movements. It demanded a kind of expressive body mechanics.&quot;

Marvin was never named in the original shorts — he was referred to as the Commander of Flying Saucer X-2 in &quot;The Hasty Hare&quot; in 1952, and sometimes referred to as &quot;Antwerp&quot; in promotional material or other projects like the live stage show version of &quot;Bugs Bunny in Space&quot;. However, in 1979, once the character attracted merchandising interest, the name &quot;Marvin&quot; was selected for &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie&quot;.

Marvin appeared in five theatrical cartoons from 1948 to 1963:
* &quot;Haredevil Hare&quot; (1948)
* &quot;The Hasty Hare&quot; (1952)
* &quot;Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century&quot; (1953)
* &quot;Hare-Way to the Stars&quot; (1958)
* &quot;Mad as a Mars Hare&quot; (1963)

==History==

Marvin hails from the planet Mars, but is often found elsewhere. He is often accompanied by his dog &quot;K-9&quot;, and sometimes by other creatures: One gag, first used in &quot;Hare-Way to the Stars&quot; (1958), involved candy-sized &quot;Instant Martians&quot; that become full-size upon addition of drops of water.

Marvin wears a Roman soldier&#x27;s uniform, with basketball shoes resembling the Chuck Taylor All-Stars brand. The helmet and skirt that he wears are green and his suit is red (in a few of the original shorts, his suit was green and the helmet and skirt golden). His head is a black sphere with only eyes for features. The curved crest of his helmet appears, with the push-broom-like upper section, to comically resemble the helm of an ancient Greek hoplite, or the galea of a Roman centurion. The appearance of the combination of Marvin&#x27;s head and helmet led to Bugs Bunny referring to him as a &quot;bowling ball wearing a spittoon&quot; in one short. Marvin speaks with a soft, nasally voice, and often speaks technobabble. He is also known for his trademark quotes &quot;Where&#x27;s the kaboom? There was supposed to be an Earth-shattering kaboom!&quot;, &quot;Isn&#x27;t that lovely?&quot;, and &quot;This makes me very angry, very angry indeed.&quot; (which is usually followed by him huffing and puffing). His voice sounds similar to the one used for Claude Cat.

On numerous occasions, Marvin has tried to destroy the Earth with his &quot;Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator&quot; (sometimes pronounced &quot;Illudium Pu-36&quot; or &quot;Uranium Pu-36&quot;). The original reference to &quot;Uranium Pu-36&quot; was changed to &quot;Illudium PU-36&quot; in subsequent cartoons. The &quot;Pu&quot; is a reference to plutonium. Marvin always laboriously over-pronounces the name of the device, which resembles a stick of dynamite, in order to avoid any possibility of confusing it with some other similar form of explosive technology. Marvin attempts to destroy the Earth because, he reasons, &quot;it obstructs my view of Venus&quot;; he has been trying to destroy the Earth for more than two millennia, suggesting that members of his species, and possibly Martian creatures in general, have extremely long lifespans. Marvin is consistently foiled by Bugs Bunny. He has battled for space territory, Planet X, with Daffy Duck, a.k.a. &quot;Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century&quot;.

===Later appearances===
He has appeared in three animated shows — as a toddler in &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot;, as a primary antagonist in the &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; television series and as a supporting character in &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;.
* In &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot;, Baby Marvin shares a lot of similarities with his adult counterpart. His helmet, however, sports a propeller rather than a push-broom. Also, his shoes are smaller in proportion. He appears in the episode entitled &quot;War of the Weirds&quot; as a visitor to Granny&#x27;s house. Throughout most of the episode, he is nonverbal as he is too shy to talk to the babies; he fidgets and mumbles when Baby Bugs and Baby Taz try to talk to him. He tries to make friends, but he is shunned and ridiculed by the babies (except for Baby Taz) for being &quot;weird&quot;. The babies still shun and play tricks on him, until he cries. Baby Taz courageously befriends him and speaks on his behalf. He fixes Baby Bugs&#x27; broken toy rocket and is able to talk when Baby Bugs offered to play his toy. The babies feel guilty for being unfriendly and they eventually befriend him. He is mainly featured in the song &quot;Oh Where Has My Martian Gone?&quot; (based on the children&#x27;s song &quot;Oh Where Has My Little Dog Gone?&quot;), and made appearances in a few other music videos.
* In &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot;, he is a Martian commander in service of the Martian Queen Tyr&#x27;ahnee. This show reused his original name from &quot;The Hasty Hare&quot; (although the opening credits list him as Marvin playing Commander X-2, in the same way as Daffy is playing Duck Dodgers).
* Marvin the Martian appears in &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; episode &quot;Reunion&quot; and appeared in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short &quot;I&#x27;m a Martian&quot;, voiced by Eric Bauza. Here, he is described as a former classmate of Daffy&#x27;s who has been plotting to destroy Earth since graduation. The episode also has a flashback, in which it is revealed that the yellow headdress on the top of his helmet is actually his hair, showing that in high school (before he started wearing the helmet) he kept it down.

Over a decade prior to any of these, he guest-starred in a &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; segment titled &quot;Duck Dodgers Jr.&quot;, where he was accompanied by an apprentice named Marcia the Martian.

He was also in a &quot;Taz-Mania&quot; episode &quot;The Man from M.A.R.S.&quot; and had a cameo appearance in &quot;The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries&quot; (&quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kitty?&quot;).

Marvin also made appearances on &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, notably in the Mindy and Buttons short subject, &quot;Cat on a Hot Steel Beam&quot; (which also featured the cute kitten Pussyfoot) and in &quot;Star Warners&quot;, along with his dog K-9, and most recently in a MetLife commercial.

Cartoon Network also created a 2-minute filler piece featuring Marvin, entitled &quot;Mars Forever&quot; by Fantastic Plastic Machine. It&#x27;s a disco-style video combining clips of Marvin and Bugs Bunny from their encounters in &quot;Haredevil Hare&quot;, &quot;Hare-Way to the Stars&quot;, as well as bits of &quot;Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century&quot; and &quot;Rocket-Bye Baby&quot;.

Marvin has also appeared in a number of video games. He served as the main antagonist in the Genesis video games &quot;Taz in Escape from Mars&quot; and &quot;Bugs Bunny in Double Trouble&quot;, the Super NES game &quot;Daffy Duck: The Marvin Missions&quot;, and the Game Boy Color game &quot;Looney Tunes Collector: Alert!&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time&quot; for the PlayStation where he was the boss of Dimension X, and in the final level of &quot;Sheep, Dog, &#x27;n&#x27; Wolf&quot;. He is also a recurring enemy in the Quantum Beep stages of &quot;Road Runner&#x27;s Death Valley Rally&quot; for Super NES. He also was an enemy in &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;. He is also a playable character in &quot;Looney Tunes: Space Race&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes: Marvin Strikes Back!&quot; &quot;Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal&quot;, and &quot;MultiVersus&quot;.

Marvin was also cast as the referee in &quot;Space Jam&quot; (though he did not stay to referee the whole game due to Bupkus beating him up), and then later had a major role in &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; where he was hired by the ACME chairman (Steve Martin), to finish DJ (Brendan Fraser) and the gang at Area 52. In the film&#x27;s climax, he reappears to bring the Blue Monkey diamond to the ACME satellite, but is thwarted by Bugs (who he duels in a parody of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jango Fett in &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;) and Daffy (who arrives as Duck Dodgers to save Bugs after he is exhausted from the battle).

Marvin appeared in the Looney Tunes version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, &quot;Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas&quot; as an employee at Daffy Duck&#x27;s &quot;Lucky Duck Super Store&quot;. Marvin was homesick for his planet, Mars, and wanted to go back for Christmas (but also mentions that he is planning to destroy the Earth as well). At first, Daffy does not let him take Christmas off, since he expects the employees to work on Christmas Day. After being visited by the abrasive yet well-intentioned Christmas ghosts, Daffy is redeemed, and as part of a surprise Christmas celebration, gives Marvin a rocket that will go faster than the speed of light, allowing him to make it to Mars by yesterday.

Marvin is the main antagonist in &quot;Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run&quot;. In the film, he plots to turn the Earth invisible and sends his henchman Cecil Turtle (who posed as a government agent) and a pair of disguised Instant Martians to get Lola Bunny&#x27;s perfume which is able to turn anything invisible. However, his plan is fooled by Bugs Bunny, who gets Marvin to accidentally destroying his lair (and Mars as a whole).

In nearly all of his appearances, Marvin is shown using a raygun that fires either bubbles of pliable plastic or energy beams, and he is seen in &quot;Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24½th Century&quot;, with Gossamer, a hairy red monster, as his assistant.

Marvin made a brief cameo in the 2003–2007 CN Fridays intro.

Marvin&#x27;s descendant Melvin (voiced by Joe Alaskey) appeared as a one-time antagonist in &quot;Loonatics Unleashed&quot;.

Marvin is a minor character in &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;, voiced by Eric Bauza, where he appears alongside K-9 after Bugs claims Tune World in the name of the Earth. Marvin arrives to claim Tune World in the name of Mars, though Bugs tricks him into thinking that Tune World is in the clear. Bugs hijacks Marvin&#x27;s ship and retreats with LeBron James to find the other Tunes. A recurring gag is that Marvin gets knocked out by the hatch of his ship everytime he regains consciousness.

Marvin appears in the preschool series &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot;, debuting in the episode &quot;Blast Off&quot;.

Marvin appears as a playable character in the video game &quot;Multiversus&quot; as a projectile based character who uses his rayguns and a Martian ship that fires rockets.

==Cancelled film adaptation==
On July 29, 2008, Warner Bros. and Alcon Entertainment announced plans for a live action/animated film starring Mike Myers as the voice of Marvin and Christopher Lee as Santa Claus. The film would have involved Marvin trying to destroy the Earth during Christmas by becoming a competitor of Santa Claus but being prevented from accomplishing his goal when Santa wraps him inside a gift box. Alcon compared the project to other films such as &quot;Racing Stripes&quot; and &quot;My Dog Skip&quot;. It was initially scheduled for an October 7, 2011, release, but the movie was later taken off the schedule and no word on it has been heard since. Test footage of the film and the Eddie Murphy vehicle &quot;Hong Kong Phooey&quot; was leaked on December 28, 2012.

<text>Matsya () is the fish avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu. Often described as the first of Vishnu&#x27;s ten primary avatars, Matsya is described to have rescued the first man, Manu, from a great deluge. Matsya may be depicted as a giant fish, often golden in color, or anthropomorphically with the torso of Vishnu connected to the rear half of a fish.

The earliest account of Matsya is found in the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana,&quot; where Matsya is not associated with any particular deity. The fish-saviour later merges with the identity of Brahma in post-Vedic era, and still later, becomes regarded with Vishnu. The legends associated with Matsya expand, evolve, and vary in Hindu texts. These legends have embedded symbolism, where a small fish with Manu&#x27;s protection grows to become a big fish, and the fish saves the man who would be the progenitor of the next race of mankind. In later versions, Matsya slays a demon named Hayagriva who steals the Vedas, and thus is lauded as the saviour of the scriptures.

The tale is ascribed with the motif of flood myths, common across cultures.

==Etymology==
The deity Matsya derives his name from the word &quot;matsya&quot; (), meaning &quot;fish&quot;. Monier-Williams and R. Franco suggest that the words &quot;matsa&quot; and &quot;matsya&quot;, both meaning fish, derive from the root &quot;mad&quot;, meaning &quot;to rejoice, be glad, exult, delight or revel in&quot;. Thus, matsya means the &quot;joyous one&quot;. The Sanskrit grammarian and etymologist Yaska () also refers to the same stating that fish are known as &quot;matsya&quot; as &quot;they revel in eating each other&quot;. Yaska also offers an alternate etymology of &quot;matsya&quot; as &quot;floating in water&quot; derived from the roots &quot;syand&quot; (to float) and &quot;madhu&quot; (water). The Sanskrit word &quot;matsya&quot; is cognate with Prakrit &quot;maccha&quot; (&quot;fish&quot;).

== Legends and scriptural references ==

=== Vedic origins ===

The section 1.8.1 of the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; (&quot;Yajur veda&quot;) is the earliest extant text to mention Matsya and the flood myth in Hinduism. It does not associate the fish Matsya with any other deity in particular.

The central characters of this legend are the fish (Matsya) and Manu. The character Manu is presented as the legislator and ancestor king. One day, water is brought to Manu for his ablutions. In the water is a tiny fish. The fish states that it fears being swallowed by a larger fish and appeals to Manu to protect it. In return, the fish promises to rescue Manu from an impending flood. Manu accepts the request. He puts the fish in a pot of water where it grows. Then he prepares a ditch filled with water, and transfers it there where it can grow freely. Once the fish grows further to be big enough to be free from danger, Manu transfers it into the ocean. The fish thanks him, tells him the timing of the great flood, and asks Manu to build a ship by that day, one he can attach to its horn. On the predicted day, Manu visits the fish with his boat. The devastating floods come. Manu ties the boat to the horn. The fish carries the boat with Manu to the high grounds of the northern mountains (interpreted as the Himalayas). The lone survivor Manu then re-establishes life by performing austerities and yajna (sacrifices). The goddess Ida appears from the sacrifice and both together initiate the race of Manu, the humans.

According to Bonnefoy, the Vedic story is symbolic. The little fish alludes to the Indian &quot;law of the fishes&quot;, an equivalent to the &quot;law of the jungle&quot;. The small and weak would be devoured by the big and strong, and needs the dharmic protection of the legislator and king Manu to enable it to attain its full potential and be able to help later. Manu provides the protection, the little fish grows to become big and ultimately saves all existence. The boat that Manu builds to get help from the saviour fish, states Bonnefoy, is symbolism of the means to avert complete destruction and for human salvation. The mountains represent the doorway for ultimate refuge and liberation. Edward Washburn Hopkins suggests that the favour of Manu rescuing the fish from death, is reciprocated by the fish.

Though Matsya does not appear in older scriptures, the seeds of the legend may be traced to the oldest Hindu scripture, the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. Manu (lit. &quot;man&quot;), the first man and progenitor of humanity, appears in the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. Manu is said to have performed the first sacrifice by kindling the sacrificial fire (Agni) with seven priests; Manu&#x27;s sacrifice becomes the archetypal sacrifice. Narayan Aiyangar suggests that the ship from the Matsya legend alludes to the ship of Sacrifice referred in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; and the &quot;Aitareya Brahmana&quot;. In this context, the fish denotes Agni - God as well as the sacrificial flames. The legend thus signifies how man (Manu) can sail the sea of sins and troubles with the ship of sacrifice and the fish-Agni as his guide.

In a prayer to kushta plant in the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;, a golden ship is said to rest at a Himalayan peak, where the herb grows. Maurice Bloomfield suggests that this may be an allusion to Manu&#x27;s ship.

=== Saviour of Manu from the Deluge ===
The tale of Matsya also appears in sec. 186 of Book 3 (the &quot;Vana Parva&quot;) of the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. The legend begins with Manu (specifically Vaivasvata Manu, the present Manu. Manu is envisioned as a title, rather than an individual) performing religious rituals on the banks of the Chirini River in Vishāla forest. A little fish comes to him and asks for his protection, promising to save him from a deluge in the future. The legend moves in the same vein as the Vedic version. Manu places him in the jar. Once it outgrows the jar, the fish asks to be put into a tank which Manu helps with. Then the fish outgrows the tank, and with Manu&#x27;s help reaches the Ganges River (Ganga), finally to the ocean. Manu is asked by the fish, as in the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; version, to build a ship and additionally, to be in it with Saptarishi (seven sages) and all sorts of seeds, on the day of the expected deluge. Manu accepts the fish&#x27;s advice. The deluge begins. The fish arrives to Manu&#x27;s aid. He ties the ship with a rope to the horn of the fish, who then steers the ship to the Himalayas, carrying Manu through a turbulent storm. The danger passes. The fish then reveals himself as Brahma and gives the power of creation to Manu.

The key difference between the Vedic version and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; version of the allegorical legend are the latter&#x27;s identification of Matsya with Brahma, a more explicit discussion of the &quot;law of the fishes&quot; where the weak needs the protection from the strong, and the fish asking Manu to bring along sages and grains.

The &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; identifies the fish-savior (Matsya) with Vishnu, instead of Brahma. The Purana derives its name from Matsya and begins with the tale of Manu. King Manu renounces the world. Pleased with his austerities on Malaya mountains (interpreted as Kerala in Southern India), Brahma grants his wish to rescue the world at the time of the &quot;pralaya&quot; (dissolution at end of a &quot;kalpa&quot;). As in other versions, Manu encounters a little fish that miraculously increases in size over time and soon he transfers the fish to the Ganges and later to the ocean. Manu recognizes the fish as Vishnu. The fish warns him about the impending fiery end of &quot;kalpa&quot; accompanied with the &quot;pralaya&quot; as a deluge. The fish once again has a horn, but the gods gift a ship to Manu. Manu carries all types of living creatures and plant seeds to produce food for everyone after the deluge is over. When the great flood begins, Manu ties the cosmic serpent Shesha to the fish&#x27;s horn. In the journey towards the mountains, Manu asks questions to Matsya and their dialogue constitutes the rest of the Purana.

The &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; story is also symbolic. The fish is divine to begin with, and needs no protection, only recognition and devotion. It also ties the story to its cosmology, connecting two &quot;kalpa&quot;s through the cosmic symbolic residue in the form of Shesha. In this account, the ship of Manu is called the ship of the Vedas, thus signifying the rites and rituals of the Vedas. Roy further suggests that this may be an allusion to the gold ship of Manu in the &quot;Rigveda&quot;.
In the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot;, Matsya is said to have rescued the seventh Manu, Vaivasvata Manu, from the great deluge by placing him in a boat. The &quot;Linga Purana&quot; praises Vishnu as the one who saved various beings as a fish by tying a boat to his tail.

===Saviour of the Vedas===

The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; adds another reason for the Matsya avatar. At the end of the &quot;kalpa&quot;, a demon Hayagriva (&quot;horse-necked&quot;) steals the Vedas, which escape from the yawn of a sleepy Brahma. Vishnu discovers the theft. He descends to earth in the form of a little &quot;saphari&quot; fish, or the Matsya avatar. One day, the king of Dravida country (South India) named Satyavrata cups water in his hand for libation in the Kritamala river (identified with Vaigai River in Tamil Nadu, South India). There he finds a little fish. The fish asks him to save him from predators and let it grow. Satyavrata is filled with compassion for the little fish. He puts the fish in a pot, from there to a well, then a tank, and when it outgrows the tank, he transfers the fish finally to the sea. The fish rapidly outgrows the sea. Satyavrata asks the supernatural fish to reveal its true identity, but soon realizes it to be Vishnu. Matsya-Vishnu informs the king of the impending flood coming in seven days. The king is asked to collect every species of animal, plant, and seeds as well as the seven sages (Saptarshi) in a boat. The fish asks the king to tie the boat to its horn with the help of the Shesha serpent. The deluge comes. While carrying them to safety, the fish avatar teaches the highest knowledge to the sages and Satyavrata to prepare them for the next cycle of existence. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; states that this knowledge was compiled as a Purana, interpreted as an allusion to the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot;. After the deluge, Matsya slays the demon and rescues the Vedas, restoring them to Brahma, who has woken from his sleep to restart creation afresh. Satyavrata becomes Vaivasvata Manu and is installed as the Manu of the current &quot;kalpa&quot;.

The &quot;Agni Purana&quot; narrative is similar to the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; version placed around Kritamala river and also records the rescue of Vedas from the demon Hayagriva. It mentions Vaivasvata Manu only collecting all seeds (not living beings) and assembling the seven sages similar to the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; version. It also adds the basis of the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot;, being the discourse of Matsya to Manu, similar to the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; version. While listing the Puranas, the &quot;Agni Purana&quot; states that the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; was told by Matsya to Manu at the beginning of the &quot;kalpa&quot;.

The &quot;Varaha Purana&quot; equates Narayana (identified with Vishnu) as the creator-god, instead of Brahma. Narayana creates the universe. At the start of a new &quot;kalpa&quot;, Narayana wakes from his slumber and thinks about the Vedas. He realizes that they are in the cosmic waters. He takes the form of a gigantic fish and rescues the Vedas and other scriptures. In another instance, Narayana retrieves the Vedas from the Rasatala (netherworld) and grants them to Brahma. The Purana also extols Narayana as the primordial fish who also bore the earth. PPL

The &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; states that Matsya slew Hayagriva and rescued the Vedas as well as the Manu. In another instance, it states that Vishnu as Matsya killed the demon Pralamba in the reign of the third Manu - Uttama. The &quot;Narada Purana&quot; states that the demon Hayagriva (son of Kashyapa and Diti) seized the Vedas of the mouth of Brahma. Vishnu then takes the Matsya form and kills the demon, retrieving the Vedas. The incident is said to have happened in the Badari forest. The deluge and Manu are dropped in the narrative. The &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; praises Vishnu as Matsya who rescued the Vedas via king Satyavrata and swam through the ocean of &quot;pralaya&quot;.

The &quot;Padma Purana&quot; replaces Manu with the sage Kashyapa, who finds the little fish who expands miraculously. Another major divergence is the absence of the deluge. Vishnu as Matsya slays the demon Shankha. Matsya-Vishnu then orders the sages to gather the Vedas from the waters and then presents the same to Brahma in Prayag. This Purana does not reveal how the scriptures drowned in the waters. Vishnu then resides in the Badari forest with other deities. The &quot;Karttikamsa-Mahatmya&quot; in the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; narrates that slaying of the &quot;asura&quot; (demon) Shankha by Matsya. Shankha (lit. &quot;conch&quot;), the son of Sagara (the ocean), snatches the powers of various gods. Shankha, wishing to acquire more power, steals the Vedas from Brahma, while Vishnu was sleeping. The Vedas escape from his clutches and hide in the ocean. Implored by the gods, Vishnu wakes on Prabodhini Ekadashi and takes the form of a &quot;saphari&quot; fish and annihilates the demon. Similar to the &quot;Padma Purana&quot;, the sages re-compile the scattered Vedas from the oceans. The Badari forest and Prayag also appear in this version, though the tale of growing fish and Manu is missing.

Another account in the &quot;Padma Purana&quot; mentions that a demon son called Makara steals the Vedas from Brahma and hides them in the cosmic ocean. Beseeched by Brahma and the gods, Vishnu takes the Matsya-form and enters the waters, then turns into a crocodile and destroys the demon. The sage Vyasa is credited with re-compilation of the Vedas in this version. The Vedas are then returned to Brahma.

The &quot;Brahma Purana&quot; states that Vishnu took the form of a rohita fish when the earth was in the netherland to rescue the Vedas. The Krishna-centric &quot;Brahmavaivarta Purana&quot; states that Matsya is an avatar of Krishna (identified with Supreme Being) and in a hymn to Krishna praises Matsya as the protector of the Vedas and Brahmins (the sages), who imparted knowledge to the king.

The &quot;Purusottama-Ksetra-Mahatmya&quot; of &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; in relationship of the origin of the herb &quot;Damanaka&quot; states that a &quot;daitya&quot; (demon) named Damanaka tormented people and wandered in the waters. On the request of Brahma, Vishnu takes the Matsya form, pulls the demon from the waters and crushes him on land. The demon transforms into a fragrant herb called Damanaka, which Vishnu wears in his flower garland.

===In avatar lists===

Matsya is generally enlisted as the first avatar of Vishnu, especially in Dashavatara (ten major avatars of Vishnu) lists. However, that was not always the case. Some lists do not list Matsya as first, and only later texts start the trend of Matsya as the first avatar.

In the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; listing of the Dashavatara, Matsya is the first. The &quot;Linga Purana&quot;, the &quot;Narada Purana&quot;, the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot;, the &quot;Varaha Purana&quot;, the &quot;Padma Purana&quot;, the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; also mention Matsya as the first of the ten classical avatars.

The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; and the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; regard Matsya as the tenth of 22 avatars and describe him as the &quot;support of the earth&quot;.

The &quot;Ayidhya-Mahatmya&quot; of the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; mentions 12 avatars of Vishnu, with Matsya as the 2nd avatar. Matsya is said to support Manu, plants and others like a boat at the end of Brahma&#x27;s day (&quot;pralaya&quot;).

===Other scriptural references===

The &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; narrative of Vishnu&#x27;s boar avatar Varaha alludes to the Matsya and Kurma avatars, saying that Brahma (identified with Narayana, an epithet transferred to Vishnu) took these forms in previous &quot;kalpa&quot;s.

The &quot;Agni Purana&quot;, the &quot;Brahma Purana&quot; and the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; suggests that Vishnu resides as Matsya in Kuru-varsha, one of the regions outside the mountains surrounding Mount Meru.

==Iconography==

Matsya is depicted in two forms: as a zoomorphic fish or in an anthropomorphic form. The &quot;Agni Purana&quot; prescribes Matsya be depicted zoomorphically. The &quot;Vishnudharmottara Purana&quot; recommends that Matsya be depicted as horned fish.

In the anthropomorphic form, the upper half is that of the four-armed man and the lower half is a fish. The upper half resembles Vishnu and wears the traditional ornaments and the &quot;kirita-mukuta&quot; (tall conical crown) as worn by Vishnu. He holds in two of his hands the &quot;Sudarshana chakra&quot; (discus) and a &quot;shankha&quot; (conch), the usual weapons of Vishnu. The other two hands make the gestures of &quot;varadamudra&quot;, which grants boons to the devotee, and &quot;abhayamudra&quot;, which reassures the devotee of protection. In another configuration, he might have all four attributes of Vishnu, namely the &quot;Sudarshana chakra&quot;, a &quot;shankha&quot;, a gada (mace) and a lotus.

In some representations, Matsya is shown with four hands like Vishnu, one holding the chakra, another the shankha, while the front two hands hold a sword and a book signifying the Vedas he recovered from the demon. Over his elbows is an &quot;angavastra&quot; draped, while a &quot;dhoti-&quot;like draping covers his hips.

In rare representations, his lower half is human while the upper body (or just the face) is of a fish. The fish-face version is found in a relief at the Chennakesava Temple, Somanathapura.

Matsya may be depicted alone or in a scene depicting his combat with a demon. A demon called Shankhasura emerging from a conch is sometimes depicted attacking Matsya with a sword as Matsya combats or kills him. Both of them may be depicted in the ocean, while the god Brahma and/or manuscripts or four men, symbolizing the Vedas, may be depicted in the background. In some scenes, Matsya is depicted as a fish pulling the boat with Manu and the seven sages in it.

==Evolution and symbolism==
The story of a great deluge is found in many civilizations across the earth. It is often compared with the Genesis narrative of the flood and Noah&#x27;s Ark. The fish motif reminds readers of the Biblical &#x27;Jonah and the Whale&#x27; narrative as well; this fish narrative, as well as the saving of the scriptures from a demon, are specifically Hindu traditions of this style of the flood narrative. Similar flood myths also exist in tales from ancient Sumer and Babylonia, Greece, the Maya of Americas and the Yoruba of Africa.

The flood was a recurring natural calamity in Ancient Egypt and Tigris–Euphrates river system in ancient Babylonia. A cult of fish-gods arose in these regions with the fish-saviour motif. While Richard Pischel believed that fish worship originated in ancient Hindu beliefs, Edward Washburn Hopkins rejected the same, suggesting its origin in Egypt. The creator, fish-god Ea in the Sumerian and Babylonian version warns the king in a dream of the flood and directs him to build a boat. The idea may have reached the Indian subcontinent via the Indo-Aryan migrations or through trade routes to the Indus Valley civilisation. Another theory suggests the fish myth is home-grown in the Indus Valley or South India Dravidian peoples. The Puranic Manu is described to be in South India. As for Indus Valley theory, the fish is common in the seals; also horned beasts like the horned fish are common in depictions.

Even if the idea of the flood myth and the fish-god may be imported from another culture, it is cognate with the Vedic and Puranic cosmogonic tale of Creation through the waters. In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the Puranas, the flood myth is in fact a cosmogonic myth. The deluge symbolizes dissolution of universe (pralaya); while Matsya &quot;allegorizes&quot; the Creator-god (Brahma or Vishnu), who recreates the universe after the great destruction. This link to Creation may be associated with Matsya regarded as Vishnu&#x27;s first avatar.

Matsya is believed to symbolise the aquatic life as the first beings on earth. Another symbolic interpretation of the Matsya mythology is, states Bonnefoy, to consider Manu&#x27;s boat to represent moksha (salvation), which helps one to cross over. The Himalayas are treated as a boundary between the earthly existence and land of salvation beyond. The protection of the fish and its horn represent the sacrifices that help guide Manu to salvation. Treated as a parable, the tale advises a good king should protect the weak from the mighty, reversing the &quot;law of fishes&quot; and uphold dharma, like Manu, who defines an ideal king. In the tales where the demon hides the Vedas, dharma is threatened and Vishnu as the divine Saviour rescues dharma, aided by his earthly counterpart, Manu - the king.

Another theory suggests that the boat of Manu and the fish represents the constellations of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor respectively, when the star Thuban was the Pole Star (4th to 2nd millennium BCE).

==Worship==
Matsya is invoked as a form of Vishnu in various hymns in scriptures. In a prayer in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, Matsya is invoked for protection from the aquatic animals and the waters. The &quot;Agni Purana&quot; suggests that Matsya be installed in the Northern direction in temples or in water bodies. The &quot;Vishnudharmottara Purana&quot; prescribes worship for Matsya for grain. Matsya is invoked as a form of Vishnu in hymns in the &quot;Brahma Purana&quot;. The &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot; version of the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; includes Matsya. The &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot; in the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; includes &quot;Matsya&quot;, &quot;Maha-matsya&quot; (&quot;Great fish&quot;) and &quot;Timingila&quot; (&quot;a great aquatic creature&quot;).

The third day in the bright fortnight of the Hindu month of Chaitra is celebrated as Matsya Jayanti, the birthday of Matsya, when his worship is recommended. Vishnu devotees observe a fast from a day before the holy day; take a holy bath on Matsya Jayanti and worship Matsya or Vishnu in the evening, ending their fast. Vishnu temples organize a special Puja. The Meena community claim a mythological descent from Matsya, who is called Meenesh (&quot;Lord of the Meenas&quot;/ &quot;Fish-Lord&quot;). Matsya Jayanti is celebrated as Meenesh Jayanti by the Meenas.

The &quot;Varaha Purana&quot; and the &quot;Margashirsha-Mahatmya&quot; of the &quot;Padma Purana&quot; recommends a &quot;vrata&quot; (vow) with fasting and worshipping Matsya (as a golden fish) in a three lunar-day festival culminating on the twelfth lunar day of the month of Margashirsha.

There are very few temples dedicated to Matsya. Prominent ones include the Shankhodara temple in Bet Dwarka and Vedanarayana Temple in Nagalapuram. Matsya Narayana Temple, Bangalore also exists. The &quot;Brahma Purana&quot; describes that Matsya-madhava (Vishnu as Matsya) is worshipped with Shveta-madhava (King Shveta) in the Shveta-madhava temple of Vishnu near the sacred Shweta ganga pond in Puri. A temple to Machhenarayan (Matsya) is found in Machhegaun, Nepal, where an annual fair is held in honour of the deity. The Koneswaram Matsyakeswaram temple in Trincomalee, Sri Lanka is now destroyed. 

There are three temples dedicated to Matsya in Kerala. The Sree Malsyavathara Mahavishnu Temple is located in the small town of Meenangadi situated on the highway between Kalpetta and Sulthan Bathery in Wayanad. Matsyamurti is the name of the principal deity, though the idol itself is that of Vishnu. The second temple dedicated to Matsya in the state is the Mootoli Sree Mahavishnu Temple in Kakkodi, Kozhikode. The third temple is the Perumeenpuram Vishnu Temple in Kakkur, Kozhikode. The idol is that of Matsya. The main ceremony of this temple for devotees is called &quot;mīnūt&quot; (feeding the fish).

<doc id="100120" wikidata="Q476808" url="?curid=100120" title="Kurma">
<text>Kurma (), is the second avatar of the Hindu preserver deity, Vishnu. Originating in Vedic literature such as the Yajurveda as being synonymous with the Saptarishi called Kashyapa, Kurma is most commonly associated in post-Vedic literature such as the Puranas. He prominently appears in the legend of the churning of the Ocean of Milk, referred to as the Samudra Manthana. Along with being synonymous with Akupara, the World-Turtle supporting the Earth, Kurma is listed as the second of the Dashavatara, which are the ten principal incarnations of Vishnu.

== Nomenclature and etymology ==
The Sanskrit word &#x27;Kurma&#x27; (Devanagari: कूर्म) means &#x27;Tortoise&#x27; and &#x27;Turtle&#x27;. The tortoise incarnation of Vishnu is also referred to in post-Vedic literature such as the Bhagavata Purana as &#x27;Kacchapam&#x27; (कच्छप), &#x27;Kamaṭha&#x27; (कमठ), &#x27;Akupara&#x27; (अकूपार), and &#x27;Ambucara-Atmana&#x27; (अम्बुचर-आत्मना), all of which mean &#x27;tortoise&#x27; or &#x27;form of a tortoise&#x27;.
=== The Nirukta ===
Written by the grammarian Yaska, the Nirukta is one of the six Vedangas or &#x27;limbs of the Vedas&#x27;, concerned with correct etymology and interpretation of the Vedas. The entry for the Tortoise states (square brackets &#x27;[ ]&#x27; are as per the original author):

=== Kashyapa ===
As illustrated below, Vedic literature such as the Samaveda and Yajurveda explicitly state Akupara/Kurma and the sage Kashyapa are Synonymous. Kashyapa - also meaning &#x27;Tortoise&#x27; - is considered the Progenitor of all living beings with his thirteen wives, including vegetation, as related by H.R. Zimmer:

The legend of the churning of the Ocean of Milk (Samudra Manthana) developed in post-Vedic literature is itself inextricably linked with Kurma (as the base of the churning rod) and involves other sons of Kashyapa: the devas/adityas (born from Aditi) and the asuras/Danavas/Daityas (born from Danu and Diti) use one of the Naga (born from Kadru) as a churning rope to obtain Amrita. Garuda, the king of birds and mount of Vishnu, is another son of Kashyapa (born from Vinata) often mentioned in this legend. In another, Garuda seeks the Amrita produced (eating a warring Elephant And Tortoise in the process) to free his mother and himself from enslavement from Kadru.

=== Yoga ===
Kurmasana (Tortoise Posture) is a Yoga posture. &#x27;Panikacchapika&#x27; (Sanskrit पाणिकच्छपिका), meaning &#x27;Hand Tortoise&#x27;, is a special positioning of the fingers during worship rituals to symbolise Kurma. The Kurmacakra is a Yantra, a mystical diagram for worship, in the shape of a tortoise. These are all mentioned in the Upanishads and Puranas (see below).

== Symbolism ==

The Dashavataras are compared to evolution; Kurma - the amphibian - is regarded the next stage after Matysa, the fish.

Firmness / Steadiness: W. Caland notes that in relation to &#x27;Akupara Kashyapa&#x27; in the Pancavimsa Brahmana and Jaiminiya Brahmana, the tortoise is equal to &#x27;a firm standing... and Kashyapa (The Tortoise) is able to convey (them) across the sea [of material existence]&#x27;. P.N. Sinha seems to support this view, adding &#x27;Kurma was a great Avatara as He prepared the way for the spiritual regeneration of the universe, by the Churning of the Ocean Of Milk&#x27;.

Deity Yajna-Purusha: N. Aiyangar states that as the tortoise was &#x27;used as the very basis of the fire Altar, the hidden invisible tortoise, taken together with the altar and the sacred fire, seems to have been regarded as symbolizing the Deity Yajna-Purusha who is an invisible spiritual god extending from the fire altar up to heaven and everywhere... this seems to be the reason why the tortoise is identified with the sun&#x27;.

Meditation / Churning the Mind: Aiyangar also surmises that the legend of the Samudra Manthana symbolises churning the mind through Meditation to achieve liberation (Moksha). Based on the mention of &quot;Vatarasanaḥ&quot; (&#x27;Girdled By The Wind&#x27;) Munis in the Taittirtya Aranyaka - also referred to as &quot;urdhvamanthin&quot;, meaning &#x27;those who churn upwards&#x27; - and the explanation provided in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, Aiyangar believes this would &#x27;appear to be the hidden pivot on which the gist of the riddle of the Puranic legend about the Churning For Nectar turns&#x27;. R. Jarow seems to agree, stating the churning of the Ocean of Milk represents the &#x27;Churning Of The Dualistic Mind&#x27;.

Ascetic Penance: H.H. Wilson notes that &#x27;the account [of the Samudra Manthana] in the Hari Vamsa... is explained, by the commentator, as an Allegory, in which the churning of the ocean typifies ascetic penance, and the Ambrosia is final Liberation&#x27; (Linking With The Idea Of &#x27;Steadiness&#x27; And &#x27;Firmness&#x27;), but personally dismisses this interpretation as &#x27;Mere Mystification&#x27; (Note 1, pp. 146).

Astronomy: B.G. Sidharth states that the legend of the Samudra Manthana symbolises astronomic phenomena, for example that &#x27;Mandara represents the polar regions of Earth [and the] Churning Rope, Vasuki, symbolizes the slow annual motion of Earth... Vishnu, or the Sun himself rests upon a coiled snake... which represents the rotation of the Sun on its own axis&#x27;. In regards to the tortoise supporting the Earth, Sidharth adds that the &#x27;Twelve Pillars... are evidently the twelve months of the year, and... The four elephants on which Earth rests are the Dikarin, the sentinels of the four directions.. [Kurma] symbolizes the fact that Earth is supported in space in its annual orbit around the Sun&#x27;.

== Vedas ==
A.A. Macdonell, A.B. Keith, J. Roy, J. Dowson, and W.J. Wilkins all state that the origin of Kurma is in the Vedas, specifically the Shatapatha Brahmana (related to the YajurVeda), where the name is also synonymous with Kashyapa, one of the Saptarishi (seven sages).

The &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; is the earliest extant text to mention Kurma, the tortoise. The &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; equates the tortoise - Kurma to the creator of all creatures. The god Prajapati assumes the form of Kurma to create all creatures (&quot;praja&quot;). Since he &quot;made&quot; (&quot;kar&quot;) all, Prajapati&#x27;s form was called &quot;Kurma&quot;. Kurma is equated with Kashyapa (literally &quot;tortoise&quot;), thus all creatures are called &quot;children of Kashyapa&quot;. Kurma is also called Surya (the sun).

The &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; also has the origins of Matsya, the Fish. Like Kurma, Matsya is also associated as the avatar of Vishnu later in the Puranas.

The &quot;Taittiriya Samhita&quot; suggests a ritual of burying a live tortoise at the base of the sacrificial fire altar (&quot;uttar-vedi&quot;). By this act, the sacrificer earns the merit of reaching heaven. Aiyangar suggests that the tortoise symbolizes Yajna-Purusha, the all-pervading god of Sacrifice. In another instance in the &quot;Taittiriya Samhita&quot; where Prajapati assigns sacrifices for the gods and places the oblation within himself, &quot;the Sacrificial Cake&quot; (&quot;Purodasa&quot;) is said to become a tortoise.

The &quot;Taittiriya Aranyaka&quot; describes a similar practice in a ritual called &quot;Arunaketuka-kayana&quot; where the tortoise is buried under the altar. Here, Prajapati or his &quot;juice&quot; (&quot;rasa&quot;) the tortoise is called Arunaketu (&quot;one who has red rays&quot;). Prajapati performs austerities (&quot;tapas&quot;). From his &quot;rasa&quot; springs a tortoise swimming in the water. Prajapati declares to the tortoise to be his creation; in response the tortoise says that he has existed from &quot;before&quot; and manifests as &quot;Purusha&quot; - the primordial being and creates various deities including the sun, Agni (the fire), Indra, Vayu (the wind) and various beings. The tortoise is again treated as the divine Creator of the universe. 

R.T.H. Griffith states that tortoises were buried in construction of the Ahavaniya Fire-Altar. In this context, the &quot;Vajasaneyi Samhita&quot; of the white &quot;Yajurveda&quot; describes the tortoise as the &quot;lord of the waters&quot;. The selection of the tortoise may stream from the belief that it supports the world.

Though Kurma is not found in the oldest Hindu scripture &quot;Rigveda&quot;, the seer Kashyapa (who is equated with Kurma) appears in hymns in the scripture. The &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; regards Kashyapa, who is mentioned along with or identified with Prajapati, as &quot;svayambhu&quot; (&quot;self-manifested&quot;). In later Hindu scriptures like the epics and the Puranas, Kashyapa is described as the grandfather of Manu, the progenitor of mankind. Apart from described as one of Saptarishi (seven great sages), he is described as one of the &quot;Prajapati&quot;s (&quot;agents of creation&quot;) and marries 13 daughters of Daksha, fathering gods, demons, animals, birds and various living beings. The seer Kashyapa, tortoise, being referred in various later Vedic literature as the progenitor of beings, is inferred by A.A. Macdonell along with other animal-based tribal names in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; to suggest totemism; however E.W. Hopkins disagrees.

The &quot;Rigveda&quot; also refers in a hymn that Vayu churned for the sages (&quot;muni&quot;s) and Rudra drinks from a cup of &quot;visha&quot;, which can be mean water or poison. John Muir suggests that &quot;visha&quot; in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; refers to Rudra drinking water, however it may have led to, in the Puranas, the legend of Shiva (who is closely linked to the Vedic Rudra) drinking poison in the Samudra Manthana (churning of the ocean) episode.

=== Samaveda ===

The sage Kashyapa - stated in the Vedas, Itihāsa (Epics), and Puranas to be the progenitor of all living beings (see relevant sections, below) - is also stated to be synonymous with Akupara, the name of the &#x27;World-Turtle&#x27; in the Mahabharata. Caland explains in his footnote to verse 30 the significance of this name by quoting from the Jaiminiya Brahmana:

The Jaiminiya Brahmana explicitly links Akupara, Kashyapa, and the tortoise in regards to providing a &#x27;Firm Standing&#x27; to cross over the sea of material existence. As illustrated below, in the Yajurveda, Kashyapa is also stated to be Synonymous with Prajapati (i.e. the Creator-God Brahma) and with Kurma. In the Puranas, Kashyapa is frequently referred to as &#x27;Prajapati&#x27; as well.

== Epics ==

Swami Achuthananda states that although varied like other legends, Vishnu&#x27;s role is &quot;limited&quot; as Kurma, compared his other avatars.

The epics present the earliest known versions of the popular Samudra Manthana narrative. In the &quot;Adi Parva&quot; Book of the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the god Narayana (identified with Vishnu) suggests the gods (&quot;devas&quot;) and the demons (&quot;asuras&quot;) churn the ocean to obtain &quot;amrita&quot; (ambrosia) as both of them seek immortality. The gods select Mount Mandara as the churning rod and the serpent Vasuki-Ananta as the rope. Then they approach Kurma-raja, the king of tortoises to support the mount on its back, which it consented. The gods churn from the tail side of the serpent, while asuras on the head side. Various trees and herbs are cast into the ocean. The churned water takes into milk. Ultimately, various precious items like Soma (the moon), the goddess Sri (Lakshmi), Sura (liquor), the white horse Uchchaihshravas, the white elephant Airavata, the gem Kaustubha and finally the god Dhanvantari with the vessel of &quot;amrita&quot; emerge from the ocean. The poison &quot;kalakuta&quot; springs from the ocean and is drunk by Shiva, whose throat becomes blue earning him the epithet &quot;Nila-kantha&quot; (The blue necked). The devas and asuras battle for the &quot;amrita&quot;. Narayana becomes an enchanting woman (called Mohini in later scriptures) and snatch the pot of &quot;amrita&quot; from the asuras. Narayana along with Nara battle the asuras, while the enchantress distributes the &quot;amrita&quot; only to the gods. Rahu, an asura, disguises himself as a god and tries to drink some Amrita himself. Surya (the sun-god) and Chandra (the moon-god) quickly inform Vishnu, and he uses the Chakra (the divine discus) to decapitate Rahu, leaving the head immortal. Eventually, the gods defeat the asuras with Indra retaining the &quot;amrita&quot; and appointing Nara as its guardian.

In this narrative, Kurma is not related with Vishnu. Though the critical edition of the epic does not refer to Kurma as an avatar of Vishnu, some latter insertions in manuscripts of the epic associate Kurma as a &quot;pradurbhava&quot; (manifestation) of Vishnu.

The &quot;Ramayana&quot; briefly mentions the Samudra Manthana episode, however does not mention Kurma in it. The epic mentions the ocean churned being the ocean of milk, the &quot;Kshirasagara&quot;. An passage, generally believed to be interpolated and not part of the critical edition, refers to Kurma as well as the drinking of the poison by Shiva. The mount Mandara sinks to Patala (the underworld) during the churning. On the beseeching of the gods, Vishnu takes the form of the tortoise and raises the mount on his back. Vishnu also supports the mount as holding its peak in a form and another form joins the gods in churning the ocean. Later versions of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; like the &quot;Adhyatma Ramayana&quot; associate Kurma with Rama, the male protagonist of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; who is also regarded as an avatar of Vishnu.

== Puranas ==

J.W. Wilkins states that the &#x27;probable&#x27; origin of Kurma is as an incarnation of Prajapati (i.e. Brahma) in the Shatapatha Brahmana (7:5:1:5-7), but as &#x27;the worship of Brahma became less popular, whilst that of Vishnu increased in its attraction, the names, attributes, and works of one deity seem to have been transferred to the other&#x27;.

Kurma as well as Varaha, the boar avatar of Vishnu, was both associated with the Creator Prajapati. Hermann Jacobi suggests that Prajapati may have worshipped in these animal forms. With Vishnu gaining the status of the Supreme God, the actions of Prajapati were transferred to Vishnu.

In post-Vedic literature, including the Puranas, Kurma is inextricably linked with the legend of the churning of the Ocean Of Milk, known as the Samudra Manthana. Kurma is also directly linked with Akupara, the so-called &#x27;world-turtle&#x27; that supports the Earth, usually with Sesa.

The tale of Vishnu appearing as Kurma to support the sinking Mandara mountain is narrated in a chapter in the &quot;Agni Purana&quot; dedicated to Samudra Manthana. The narrative starts with the curse of sage Durvasa to the gods (devas), who lose to the asuras in battle and seek refuge in Vishnu. The asuras and the devas unite to churn the milk ocean, with Mount Mandara as the churning rod and Vasuki as the rope. Kurma appears to support the mountain. The poison Halahala appears from the ocean, which is drunk by Shiva to save the world. After which, various divine objects emerge from the churning of the ocean, ending with the god Dhanavantri carrying the vessel of Amrita. When the asuras steal the pot, Vishnu assumes the form of the seductress Mohini and grabs it from the asuras and distributes it to the gods. Rahu assumes a form of a deva and drinks the amrita and is decapitated by Vishnu. 

A similar narrative is also given in the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;; Vishnu is described to participate in the churning in many forms - Kurma as the base of the mount, in one form he sits on top of Mandara and in other forms, helps the gods and the demons pull the serpentine rope. The &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot; states that Vishnu in the form of Brahma supports the mount; while as Narayana invigorated the gods. The &quot;Vayu Purana&quot;, the &quot;Padma Purana&quot; have similar narratives; the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; also narrates the tale. 

The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; describes the form of Vishnu as Ajita, the son of Vairaja and Sambhuti, who assumed the form of the tortoise to rescue Mandara from drowning. He is further called the first tortoise. In another instance, it states that the ocean tides are a result of the breathing of Kurma, who had become drowsy due to the scratching of Mandara on his back. 

Samudra Manthana is alluded briefly in the &quot;Kurma Purana&quot;, the &quot;Linga Purana&quot;, the &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana&quot; and the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot;.

Variations in these narratives alter the number and order of the divine articles appearing from the churning of the ocean. The number ranges from 9 to the popular list of 14. The common list includes the poison Halahala (Kalakuta), Varuni (Sura) - goddess of liquor, the divine horse Uchhaishravas, the gem Kaustubha, the goddess Lakshmi (Sri), the Apsaras, the cow of plenty Surabhi, the white elephant Airavata and Dhanavantri with the pot of &quot;amrita&quot; (sometimes enumerated as two objects). Other objects include the umbrella of Varuna, earrings taken by Indra for his mother Aditi, the bow of Vishnu Sharanga, the conch of Vishnu (Shankha), Nidra - the goddess of sloth, Alakshmi or Jyestha - the goddess of misfortune and the Tulasi plant.

In the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot;, Vishnu states that his form the world turtle Kurma, which supports all the worlds on his back, be requested by the gods to aid in the Samudra Manthana. Kurma is placed in Patala as the base of Mount Mandara. The &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; explicitly praises Vishnu as the world turtle who supports the Earth. The &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana&quot; states the serpent Shesha who supports the universe over his hoods, sits on Kurma, who lies in the wind or the waters.

The &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; narrative of Vishnu&#x27;s boar avatar Varaha alludes to the Matysa and Kurma avatars, saying that Brahma (identified with Narayana, an epithet transferred to Vishnu) took these forms in previous &quot;kalpa&quot;s. 

In the tale of the battle of the demon Bhandasura and the goddess Lalita in the &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot;, Lalita creates Kurma to shelter her goddess army who was drowning in the ocean, created by a weapon used by the demon.

In the &quot;Agni Purana&quot;, the Shaligram stone for Kurma is described as black in colour with circular lines and an elevated hinder part.

Kurma is invoked in worship of Vishnu in various scriptures. The &quot;Brahma Purana&quot; salutes Kurma in a hymn as the &quot;great tortoise&quot;, who &quot;lifted the Earth and kept the mountain aloft&quot;. The &quot;Linga Purana&quot;, the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; and the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; similarly praises Vishnu as the one who kept the Mandara mountain aloft or the one who supported Mandara during the churning of the ocean as a tortoise.

The &quot;Agni Purana&quot;, the &quot;Markendeya Purana&quot;, the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; and the &quot;Brahma Purana&quot; state that Vishnu resides in Bharata (the Indian subcontinent) in the form of Kurma. The&quot;Markendeya Purana&quot; gives a detailed description of various lands of the region and constellations and zodiac stars corresponding to nine parts of the tortoise - mouth, four feet, tail, centre and two sides of its belly. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; states Vishnu stays as Kurma in the Himalayan continent (&quot;Hiraṇmaya-varsa&quot;).

The &quot;Kurma Purana&quot; is one of four Puranas that bear the names of Vishnu&#x27;s avatars. The Purana is narrated by Kurma to the king Indradyumna and later to the sages and the gods at the time of Samudra Manthana. The detailed tale of the Samudra Manthana is absent from the Purana and alludes to Kurma as the one who supported Mount Mandara. The &quot;Kurma Purana&quot; is stated to be narrated by Kurma and is prescribed to be gifted with a golden statue of a tortoise in the &quot;Agni Purana&quot;.

The &quot;Agni Purana&quot; prescribes that Kurma be depicted in zoomorphic form as a tortoise.

In the narrative of the battle between Shiva&#x27;s manifestation Virabhadra and Vishnu&#x27;s avatar Narasimha of the &quot;Linga Purana&quot; and the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot;, Virabhadra mocks Narasimha-Vishnu stating that Kurma&#x27;s skull adorns the necklace of Shiva.

In a passing reference in the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; and the &quot;Markendeya Purana&quot; narrative of Varaha, Brahma - identified with Narayana - decides to take the form of the boar Varaha, similar to the forms of the fish (Matsya) and tortoise (Kurma), he took in previous &quot;kalpa&quot;s.

The &quot;Linga Purana&quot;, the &quot;Varaha Purana&quot; and the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; mention Kurma as second in its Dashavatara listing.

The &quot;Varaha Purana&quot; recommends a &quot;vrata&quot; (vow) with fasting and worshipping Kurma-Vishnu in a three lunar-day festival culminating on the twelfth lunar day in the bright half of the Pausha month. The first day of the &quot;vrata&quot; is said to be the day when Vishnu assumed the Kurma form in Samundra manthan.

The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; lists Kurma the eleventh avatar of Vishnu in the list of 22 avatars. The &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; lists him as the eleventh of 20 avatars, elsewhere he is mentioned as the second of the Dashavatara. 

The &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot; version from the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; mentions &quot;Kurma&quot; as an epithet of Vishnu. The &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; addresses Kurma in hymns to Vishnu. He is associated with the south-western direction.

=== Narada Purana ===


In the Narada Purana, a brief synopsis of the Samudra Manthana is given by Brahma to Mohini, as quoted above (Part 4: 8.7-11). There are two other notable mentions of this legend. The first is by Saunaka who said &#x27;When there was an impediment at the time of churning the ocean for the sake of nectar, he [Kurma] held the mount Mandara on his back, for the welfare of the gods. I seek refuge in that Tortoise&#x27; (Part 1: 2.37). In the second, it is stated &#x27;it was when the milk-ocean was churning that Kamoda was born among the four jewels of Virgins&#x27; (Part 5: Uttara Bhaga: 68.4). Other details include:

* Several allegories of the tortoise drawing in its limbs are given, including in relation to the creation and withdrawal of living beings (Part 2: 44.26b-28a) and withdrawing the sense organs (Part 2: 50.89-91, and 59.36)
* The division of the Earth - &quot;Kurma-vibhaga&quot; - is in relation to the Jyotisa, an auxiliary text of the Vedas (Part 2: 54.11 and 56.739b-745)
*Kurma is one of the ten primary avatars (Dashavatara) of Vishnu (Part 4: 119.14-19)

=== Padma Purana ===


In the Padma Purana three accounts of the Samudra Manthana are given, all beginning with Indra being cursed by Durvasas for arrogance. In the first, narrated by Pulastya, as a result of the curse the &#x27;three worlds, along with Indra, were void of affluence... [and] the Daityas (sons of Diti) and Danavas (sons of Danu) started military operations against [the] gods&#x27;, forcing them to seek refuge with Vishnu. Vasuki is used as a rope to churn the ocean. Notably, during the churning, Varuni (Goddess of Wine) is upon emerging rejected by the gods and accepted by the asuras, the opposite of the account given in the Brahmanda Purana (to explain the meaning of &#x27;Asura&#x27;). Unnamed poison also emerges which is drunk by Shiva, before the emergence of Dhanvantari with the nectar of immortality (Amrita) as well as Lakshmi. Although the asuras take the nectar, Vishnu assumes the form of Mohini to trick them and give it to the gods. The asuras are destroyed, with the Danavas since then becoming &#x27;eager for (the company of) ladies&#x27; (Part 1: 4).

In the second account, narrated by Suta, as a result of the curse the &#x27;mother of the worlds&#x27; (Lakshmi) disappears, and the world is ruined by drought and famine, forcing the gods - oppressed by hunger and thirst - to seek refuge with Vishnu at the shore of the Milky Ocean (Part 5: 8). Ananta (Vasuki in the first account) is used as a churning rope. On Ekadashi day, the poison Kalakuta emerges, which is swallowed by Shiva &#x27;meditating upon Vishnu in his heart&#x27;. An evil being called Alaksmi (i.e. a-Laksmi or &#x27;not Laksmi&#x27;) them emerges and is told to reside in places such as where there is quarrel, gambling, adultery, theft, and so forth (Part 5: 9). The churning continues and auspicious beings and items emerge, including &#x27;the brother of Laksmi, [who] sprang up with nectar. (So also) Tulasi [i.e. Lakshmi], Visnu&#x27;s wife&#x27;. On this occasion, Vishnu assumes the form of Mohini merely to distribute the nectar amongst the gods, without mention of tricking the asuras (Part 5: 10).

The third account, narrated by Shiva, is very similar to the others except with a far greater emphasis on Lakshmi, and although the poison Kalakuta emerges and is swallowed by Shiva, there is no mention of Alaksmi or the Mohini avatar (Part 9: 231–232). The Naga used as a rope for churning is referred to as &#x27;the Lord of the Serpents&#x27; (likely Ananta). Other details include:

* Kurma is mentioned as an avatar of Vishnu (Part 1: 3.25b-29), as a giver of boons (Part 1: 5.81-87), and is stated to have appeared during the fourth war between the devas and asuras (Part 1: 13.180); during the churning, Indra is stated to have vanquished Prahlada (Part 1: 13.186)
* Relating to Kurma as the world-turtle, it is stated &#x27;Due to truth (alone), the sun rises; also the wind blows; the ocean would (i.e. does) not cross its boundary nor would (i.e. does) the Tortoise avert (sustaining) the earth&#x27; (Part 2: 53.3); Kurma is also mentioned as the &#x27;first tortoise&#x27;, the prop of everything, cause of production of ambrosia, and the support of the Earth (Part 7: 71.169-188); finally, after raising the earth from the waters in the form of a boar (Varaha), it is stated that Vishnu placed it on the head of Sesa before taking the form of Kurma (Part 9: 237.15-19)
* Kurma is named as one of the 10 primary avatars (Dashavatara) of Vishnu by Yama (Part 7: 66.44-54), Brahma (Part 7: 71.23-29b), and Shiva (Part 9: 229.40-44) 
* The salagrama of Kurma is described as &#x27;raised, round on the surface, and is filled with a disc (like figure). Marked with Kaustubha, it has a green colour&#x27; (Part 8: 20.51b-73)
* Kurma is stated to reside in Vaikuntha (Part 9: 228.19-24); and is one of the 108 names of Vishnu (Part 10: 17.103-117)
* Shiva gives salutations to Kurma, who &#x27;extracted the Earth along with mountains, forests and groves, from inside the water of the deep ocean&#x27; (Part 10: 6.175-190)

=== Skanda Purana ===


In the Skanda Purana four accounts of the Samudra Manthana are given. In the first, the churning of the ocean of Milk takes place after Indra is cursed by the sage Brhaspati, resulting in the disappearance of Lakshmi, misery to all, and ruin of the devas, defeated in battle by the asuras who take their precious items such as gems to Patala. On the advice of Brahma, Indra and the devas make a pact with Bali, leader of asuras, to recover the gems from the Ocean of Milk. Unable to move the Mandara mountain to use as a churning rod, Vishnu is asked for help, who arrives on Garuda, takes the mountain to the ocean, and incarnates as Kurma. Vasuki is used as the churning rope. The Kalakuta poison generated envelopes the devas and Daityas - causing ignorance and lust - before enveloping all existence (including Vaikuntha) and reducing the cosmic egg to ash (Part 1: 9). Shiva is approached for refuge, and the origin and need to worship Ganesha to &#x27;achieve success in undertaking&#x27; is explained before Shiva drinks the poison (Part 1: 10). More information on Ganesha-worship is given before the churning resumes, producing many auspicious items and beings, including Lakshmi (Part 1: 11). Dhanvantari emerges with the nectar of immortality (Amrita), which is taken by the asuras. Vishnu incarnates as Mohini, and despite warning Bali that &#x27;Women should never be trusted by a wise man&#x27; is still given the nectar which She gives to the devas (Part 1: 12).

In the second account, Indra is again cursed by the sage Brhaspati (Part 7: 8), resulting in the disappearance of Laksmi, and with her, an absence of &#x27;Penance, Purity, Mercy, Truth... True Dharma, Prosperity... Strength [and] Sattva (quality of goodness)&#x27;. Hunger, poverty, anger, lust, flesh-eating, and perverse-thinking abound, including belief that adharma is dharma, and perverse interpretations of the Vedas to justify killing animals (Part 7: 9). Vishnu is approached for refuge by the devas and instructs them to churn the Ocean of Milk (Part 7: 10). Indra forms a pact with the asuras, Sesa is used as a churning rope with the Mandara Mountain, and Vishnu incarnates as Kurma as the base. After a thousand years of churning the poison Halahala is generated and swallowed by Shiva; the drops that fell are taken by serpents, scorpions, and some medicinal plants (Part 7: 11). The churning continues for another thousand years, producing auspicious items and beings, including Laksmi (Part 7: 12). Dhanvantari emerges with the pitcher of Amrita which is taken by the asuras, and Vishnu assumes &#x27;a marvellously beautiful feminine form that enchanted all the world&#x27; (Mohini). Despite warning the asuras not to trust her, Mohini is given the Amrita which is handed to the devas before the asuras are destroyed in battle (Part 7: 13).

In the third brief account, the churning takes place after &#x27;a great loss of gems due to wicked souls&#x27; and the loss of righteousness. Vasuki is used as the churning cord as the devas and asuras &#x27;placed the main plant of activity on the back of the (divine) tortoise and churned out the precious gems&#x27;. Many auspicious items and beings are generated, including Sura (alcohol; in other accounts Varuni) and Dhanvantari. Quarreling ensues between the devas and asuras, and Vishnu incarnates as &#x27;the fascinating form of a woman&#x27; (Mohini) to beguile the demons as Indra gives them the Sura and via &#x27;sleight of hand&#x27; takes the Amrita. Halahala poison is also generated which is consumed by Shiva (Part 12: 44).

In the fourth account, the legend is briefly retold by Visvamitra. The details are much the same as the previous accounts, with Vasuki as the cord as the &#x27;Kacchapa (Tortoise incarnation of Visnu) held up (the mountain)&#x27;, including the Kalakuta poison drunk by Shiva and the incarnation of Mohini to trick the asuras. The notable exception is that the churning first produces a &#x27;hideous&#x27; family of three of Ratnas (jewels); rejected by both the devas and Danavas, they are accepted by Ka (i.e. Brahma; Part 18: 210).

Notably, reminiscent the account of Prajapati and the Tortoise in the Taittiriya Aranyaka (see above), there is also an account, during the time of the universal dissolution, when Brahma &#x27;assumed the form of a &quot;Khadyota&quot; (Firefly, Glow-worm)&#x27; and moved about for a thousand divine years before finding &#x27;the Lord [Vishnu] asleep in the form of a tortoise&#x27;. Woken by Brahma, Vishnu &#x27;got up ejecting the three worlds that had been swallowed at the time of the close of the [previous] Kalpa&#x27; with all creation - including the devas, Danavas, moon, sun, and planets - being generated from and by Him. Vishnu also sees the Earth &#x27;was in the great ocean perched on the back of the tortoise&#x27; (Part 14: Reva Khanda: 7). Other details include:

* Kurma is mentioned to have held the Mandara Mountain (Part 1: 8.89);
* After being resorted to by Tara and &#x27;Permeated by her, Kurma, the sire of the universe, lifted up the Vedas&#x27; (Part 2: 47.12-15)
* Exploring the Linga of Shiva, &#x27;The primordial Tortoise that was stationed as the bulbous root of the Golden Mountain as well as its support was seen by Acyuta [Vishnu]&#x27;; It is also by Shiva&#x27;s blessing that Sesa, Kurma, and others are capable of bearing the burden of that Linga (Part 3: Uttarardha: 11.8-11)
* After Varaha lifted the earth out of the waters, Vishnu &#x27;placed the Elephants of the Quarters, the King of Serpents and the Tortoise for giving her extra support. That receptacle of Mercy (Hari) willingly applied his own Sakti (power) in an unmanifest form as a support for them all&#x27; (Part 4: Venkatacala Mahatmya: 36.20-26); Bhrgu also states Kurma supports the earth (Part 15: Reva-Khanda: 182.1-22); and Sesa and Kurma are also later stated to stabilise the Earth (Part 17: Nagara Khanda: 144.117)
* Kurma is mentioned where Vishnu is stated to be the annihilator in the form of Rudra (Part 5: Purusottama-Ksetra Mahatmya: 22.32-43)
* Kurma is named as one of 12 incarnations of Vishnu, who states to Brahma:

* In the procedure for Puja Mandala construction, Matsya and Kurma should be installed in the South-West and depicted as animals below the waist but in human form above (Part 7: Vasudeva-Mamatmya: 27.32-33)
*It is stated that the Linga of Shiva evolved from &#x27;the back of a tortoise (shell)&#x27; (Part 9: Dharmaranya Khanda: 19.16) and that &#x27;The Bija [origin] of Vahni (Fire) is accompanied by (the seed of) Vata (Wind) and the Bija of Kurma (tortoise)&#x27; (Part 9: Dharmaranya Khanda: 20.20-23)
*It is stated that &#x27;Like a tortoise that withdraws all its limbs, he who withdraws the sense-organs though the proper procedure of Pratyahara shall become free from sins&#x27; (Part 10: Purvardha: 41.102)
*Kumari - the Shakti of Kurma - has a noose in her hand and is located to the south of Mahalaksmi (Part 11: Uttarardha: 70.69)
*&#x27;Kurma&#x27; is one of the thousand names (Vishnu Sahasranama) of Vishnu (Part 12: Avantiksetra Mahatmya: 63.83)
*Kurma is listed in the Dashavatara, or ten primary incarnations of Vishnu (Part 15: Reva-Khanda, 151.1-7)
*Bhrgu refers to a Ksetra (temple) that stands on Kaccapa (i.e. a tortoise) and states there will be a city named after Him, &quot;Bhrgukaccha&quot; (Part 15: Reva-Khanda: 182.1-22)
*The star constellations in the form of Kurma (i.e. the tortoise) are discussed, where it is also stated Kurma is stationed in Bharata and faces the east (Part 19: Prabhasa-Ksetra Mahatmya: 7.17-37 and 11.18)
*A Holy spot called Prabhasa in Bharata is located to the south-west of the shrine of Kurma (Part 20: Prabhasa Khanda: 167.33)

==Temples==


=== Iconography ===
The Samudra Manthana is popular in iconography and even found in South East Asia. Notable depictions include the relief at Angkor Wat with Vishnu and Kurma in the centre and the gods and demons on either side churning the ocean. The earth below the temple represents Kurma in Khymer iconography, the earth goddess being Vishnu&#x27;s consort. The Vishnu on the top of Mandara symbolizes him as the shining midday Sun.

Kurma is depicted either zoomorphically as a tortoise.

In the anthropomorphic form, the upper half is that of the four-armed man and the lower half is a fish. The upper half resembles Vishnu and wears the traditional ornaments and the &quot;kirita-mukuta&quot; (tall conical crown) as worn by Vishnu. He holds in two of his hands the &quot;Sudarshana chakra&quot; (discus) and a &quot;shankha&quot; (conch), the usual weapons of Vishnu. The other two hands make the gestures of &quot;varadamudra&quot;, which grants boons to the devotee, and &quot;abhayamudra&quot;, which reassures the devotee of protection. The depiction is similar to Matsya, where the lower half is a fish.

=== Locations ===

Srikurmam was initially a Shiva temple, which was converted into a Vaishnava one by the Vaishnava saint Ramanuja. The sanctum has an icon of Vishnu, as well as of Kurma with the tail and back to the devotee and face to the west. This is in contradiction to scriptural mandate that the central icon should face the east. According to a legend, the Kurma icon turned to the west back wall in honour of a tribal Bhil king who worshipped him from the back of the temple. Nanditha Krishna suggests that a tribal tortoise god could have been assimilated in the Hindu fold by identifying him with Kurma.

There are five temples dedicated to this incarnation of Vishnu in India:

* Kurmai (Chittoor District of Andhra Pradesh)
* Sri Kurmam (Srikakulam District of Andhra Pradesh)
* Gavirangapur (Chitradurga District of Karnataka)
* Swarupnarayan (Goghat village in Hooghly district of West Bengal).

The name of the village mentioned above originates from the historical temple of Kurma called &quot;Varadarajaswamy&quot; (Kurma avatara of Vishnu), regarding the deity of this village.

* Amamangalam Maha Vishnu Temple (Kakkur, Calicut District, Kerala) - The presiding deity is called Kurmavataram. Local legends consider to be one of the major temples dedicated to the Dashavatara consecrated by Parashurama himself. 
* Subsidiary shrine at Garuda Temple, Triprangode, Malappuram, Kerala 

== Other uses ==
M. Vettam notes that there are ten Vayus (Winds) in the body, one of which is called &#x27;Kurma&#x27; in regards to opening and closing the eyes.

The &#x27;kurma-Nadi&#x27; (or Kūrmanāḍī, Sanskrit कूर्मनाडी), meaning &#x27;Tortoise-Nerve&#x27; or &#x27;Canal Of The Tortoise&#x27;, is in relation to steadying the mind (slowing down thoughts) in Yogic practice. &#x27;Nadi&#x27; itself means &#x27;Vein&#x27;, &#x27;Artery&#x27;, &#x27;River&#x27;, or &#x27;Any Tubular Organ Of The Body&#x27; (as well as &#x27;Flute&#x27;). Although the Kurmanaḍi is generally stated to be located in the upper chest below the throat, S. Lele believes this refers to the Muladhara Chakra, located near the Tailbone, based on the root-word &#x27;Nal&#x27; (Sanskrit नल्), meaning &#x27;to Bind&#x27;.

These are all mentioned in the Upanishads and Puranas.

<text>Varaha (, , &quot;boar&quot;) is the avatara of the Hindu god Vishnu, in the form of a boar. Varaha is generally listed as third in the Dashavatara, the ten principal avataras of Vishnu.

Varaha lifts the earth goddess Bhumi out of the cosmic ocean when the demon Hiranyaksha stole the earth goddess and hid her in the primordial waters, Vishnu appeared as Varaha to rescue her. Varaha killed Hiranyaksha and retrieved the earth goddess from the cosmic ocean, lifting it on his tusks, and restored her to her place in the universe.

Varaha is completely a boar or in an anthropomorphic form, with a boar&#x27;s head and the human body. His consort, Bhumi, the earth goddess, is a goddess lifted by Varaha.

== Etymology and other names==
The deity Varaha derives its name from the Sanskrit word &quot;varaha&quot; (Devanagari: वराह, ) meaning &quot;boar&quot; or &quot;wild boar&quot;.

The word &quot;varāha&quot; is from Proto-Indo-Iranian term &quot;warāȷ́ʰá&quot;, meaning boar. It is thus related to Avestan &quot;varāza&quot;, Kurdish &quot;beraz&quot;, Middle Persian &quot;warāz&quot;, and New Persian &quot;gorāz&quot; (گراز), all meaning &quot;wild boar&quot;.

The Sanskrit grammarian and etymologist Yaska (circa 300 BCE) states that the word &quot;varaha&quot; originates from the root √hr. The Monier-Williams dictionary states that the root √hr means &quot;&#x27;to offer&#x27;, &#x27;to outdo, eclipse, surpass&#x27;, &#x27;to enrapture, charm, fascinate&#x27;, and &#x27;to take away or remove evil or sin&#x27;&quot; and also &quot;to take away, carry off, seize, deprive of, steal, rob&quot;.

As per Yaska, the boar is an animal that &quot;tears up the roots, or it tears up all the good roots&quot; is thus called &quot;varaha&quot;. The word &quot;varaha&quot; is found in Rigveda, for example, in its verses such as 1.88.5, 8.77.10 and 10.28.4 where it means &quot;wild boar&quot;.

The word also means &quot;rain cloud&quot; and is symbolic in some Rigvedic hymns, such as Vedic deity Vritra being called a &quot;varaha&quot; in Rigvedic verses 1.61.7 and 10.99.6, and Soma&#x27;s epithet being a &quot;varaha&quot; in 10.97.7. Later the rain-relationship led the connotation of the term evolve into &quot;vara-aharta&quot;, which means &quot;bringer of good things&quot; (rain), which also mentioned by Yaska.

Yaska mentions a third meaning of the word &quot;varaha&quot;. The Vedic group of Angirases are called &quot;varaha&quot;s or collectively a &quot;varahavah&quot;.

The god Varaha is also called referred by the epithet &quot;sukara&quot; (Sanskrit सूकर, ), meaning &#x27;wild boar&#x27;, which also used in the Rigveda (e.g. 7.55.4) and Atharvaveda (e.g. 2.27.2). The word literally means &quot;the animal that makes a peculiar nasal sound in respiration&quot;; in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, Varaha is referred to Sukara, when he is born from the god Brahma&#x27;s nostrils.

== Legends and scriptural references ==

=== Vedic origins ===
The origin of Varaha is found in the Vedas, the oldest Hindu scriptures. Varaha is originally described as a form of Prajapati (a form of Brahma), but on evolved into the avatara of Vishnu in later Hindu scriptures. Two other avataras of Vishnu - Matsya (the fish) and Kurma (the tortoise) were also equated with Prajapati, a form of Brahma before being shown as forms of Vishnu in later traditions.

Arthur Anthony Macdonell traces the origins of the Varaha legend to two verses (1.61.7 and 8.66.10) of the Rigveda, the oldest Veda. Vishnu, aided by the god Indra, steals hundred buffaloes from a boar (identified Vritra by Macdonell based on verse 1.121.11); and then Indra - shooting across a mountain kills that same boar who is named Ermusha, who is Vritra in disguise. Arthur Berriedale Keith also agrees with Macdonell; interpreting the mountain as a cloud and the killing is a story of the killing of the &quot;asura&quot; Vritra by Indra. The 14th century Vedic commentator Sayana states the &quot;Taittiriya Samhita&quot; (6.2.4) elaborates the Rigveda version. However, the Rigveda does not hint at the classical legend of the rescue of the earth by the boar. In the scripture, the god Rudra (a form of the god Shiva) is called the &quot;boar of the sky&quot;. Even Vishnu has killed a boar. The hunting and butchering of a boar using dogs is also referred to.

The &quot;Taittiriya Samhita&quot; (6.2.4) mentions that the boar, &quot;the plunderer of wealth&quot;, hides the riches of the asuras, beyond the seven hills. Indra kills the board by striking it a blade of sacred &quot;kusha&quot; grass, piercing the mounts. Vishnu, &quot;the sacrifice&quot; (&quot;yajna&quot;), brings the killed boar as a sacrificial offering to the gods and goddesses, thereby the gods and goddesses acquiring the treasure of the asuras and asuris and eat the boar. Vishnu is both the sacrifice as well as the &quot;bringer of sacrifice&quot;; the boar being the sacrifice. The tale is also recalled in &quot;Charaka Brahmana&quot; and &quot;Kathaka Brahmana&quot;; the latter calls the boar Emusha.

According to J. L. Brockington, there are two distinct boar mythologies in Vedic literature. In one, he is depicted as a form of Prajapati, in other an asura named Emusha is a boar that fights Indra and Vishnu. The section 14.1.2 of the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; harmonizes the two myths and Emusha is conflated into Prajapati.

The earliest versions of the classical Varaha legend are found in the &quot;Taittiriya Samhita&quot; and the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot;; scholars differ on which one is the core version. The &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; narrates that the universe was primordial waters. The earth which was the size of a hand, was trapped in it. The god Prajapati (who is a form of Brahma) in the form of a boar (&quot;varaha&quot;) plunges into the waters and brings the earth out. He also marries the earth thereafter. The &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; calls the boar as Ermusha, which Keith relates to the boar&#x27;s epithet &quot;ermusha&quot; in the Rigveda. In the &quot;Taittiriya Samhita&quot; (7.1.5), Prajapati - who was roaming as the wind - acquires the form of a &quot;cosmogonic&quot; boar lifting the earth goddess from the primeval waters. As Vishvakarma (the creator of the world), he flattened her, thus she - the earth - was called Prithvi, &quot;the extended one&quot;. They produce various deities.

The &quot;Taittiriya Aranyaka&quot; (10.1.8) states the earth is lifted by a &quot;black boar with hundred arms&quot;. The &quot;Taittiriya Brahmana&quot; (1.1.3.6) expands the &quot;Taittiriya Samhita&quot; narrative. The &quot;Lord of creation&quot; was pondering on how the universe should be. He saw a lotus leaf and took the form of a boar to explore under it. He found mud and outstretched it on the leaf, rising above the waters. It was called the earth - Bhumi, literally &quot;that which became (spread)&quot;.

===Creation legend===
The &quot;Ayodhya Kanda&quot; book of the epic &quot;Ramayana&quot; refers to Varaha retaining his connection to Prajapati as Brahma. In a cosmogonic myth, Brahma appears in the primal universe full of water and takes the form of a boar to lift the earth from the waters; creation begins with Brahma and his progeny. The &quot;Yuddha Kanda&quot; book of the epic praises Rama (the hero of the epic, who is identified with Vishnu) as &quot;the single-tusked boar&quot;, which is interpreted as an allusion to Varaha and links Varaha with Vishnu. In the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Narayana (&quot;one who lies in the waters&quot;, an appellation of Brahma which was later transferred to Vishnu) is praised as the one who rescues the earth as a boar.

The Puranas complete the full transition of Varaha from the form of Prajapati-Brahma to the avatar of Narayana-Vishnu. The &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot;, the &quot;Vayu Purana&quot;, the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, the &quot;Linga Purana&quot;, the &quot;Markendeya Purana&quot;, the &quot;Kurma Purana&quot;, the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot;, the &quot;Padma Purana&quot; and the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; have similar narratives of the cosmogonic myth, wherein Brahma, identified with Vishnu, takes the Varaha form to raise the earth from the primeval waters.

The &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot;, one of the oldest Puranas, narrates that in the present &quot;kalpa&quot; (&quot;aeon&quot;) called &quot;Varaha kalpa&quot;, Brahma wakes from his slumber. Brahma is called Narayana (&quot;he who lies in the waters&quot;). The &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; says that Brahma roams as the wind in the waters, which is interpreted as allusion to the Vedic &quot;Taittiriya Brahmana&quot; version. Similarly alluding to the Vedic version, the detailed &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot; version says that Brahma is &quot;invisible&quot; and a shorter summary says that he becomes the wind. In the &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot;, realizing that the earth was in the waters, he decides to take the form of Varaha as the beast likes to sport in the water. Similar reasons for taking the boar form particularly are also given in the &quot;Linga Purana&quot;, the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; and the &quot;Vayu Purana&quot;. The &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; adds that Brahma-Narayana decides to take the form of Varaha, similar to the forms of the fish (Matsya) and tortoise (Kurma), he took in previous &quot;kalpa&quot;s.

The &quot;Brahma Purana&quot;, the &quot;Venkatacala Mahatmya&quot; in the &quot;Vaishnava Khanda&quot; Book of the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; and the &quot;Vishnu Smriti&quot; narrate the tale with slight variation, however Brahma is missing; it is Vishnu who unambiguously becomes Varaha to lift the sunken earth from the waters. In late addition in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the single-tusked (&quot;Eka-shringa&quot;) Varaha (identified with Vishnu) lifts the earth, which sinks under the burden of overpopulation when Vishnu assumes the duties of Yama (the god of Death) and death seizes on earth. In the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; and the &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, at the beginning of a &quot;kalpa&quot;, Vishnu creates various worlds from the cosmic golden egg. The earth, unable to bear the weight of the new mountains and losing her energy, sinks in the waters to the subterranean realm of Rasatala - the abode of the demons. In the first account in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; states that in early stages of creation, Brahma creates various beings, however finds the earth under the waters. Varaha (identified with Vishnu, the Lord of sacrifice) emerges as a tiny beast (a size of a thumb) from the nostrils of Brahma, but soon starts to grow. Varaha&#x27;s size increases to that of an elephant and then to that of an enormous mountain and later, he becomes larger than the whole earth and raises it to the intrastellar space where Brahma places the created beings on top of.
The scriptures emphasize Varaha&#x27;s gigantic size. The &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot;, the &quot;Vayu Purana&quot;, the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot;, the &quot;Harivamsa&quot; and the &quot;Linga Purana&quot; describes Varaha as 10 &quot;yojana&quot;s (The range of a &quot;yojana&quot; is disputed and ranges between ) in width and a 1000 &quot;yojana&quot;s in height. He is large as a mountain and blazing like the sun. Dark like a rain cloud in complexion, his tusks are white, sharp and fearsome. His body is the size of the space between the earth and the sky. His thunderous roar is frightening. In one instance, his mane is so fiery and fearsome that Varuna, the god of the waters, requests Varaha to save him from it. Varaha complies and folds his mane.

Early texts like the &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot; and the &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; build up on the &quot;Taittiriya Brahmana&quot; Vedic cosmogonic concept of &quot;Yajna-varaha&quot; (Varaha as sacrifice). The &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot; describes that acquiring the boar form composed of Vedic sacrifices, he plunges in waters, finding the earth in the subterranean realm. Varaha&#x27;s various body parts are compared with various implements or participants of a &quot;yajna&quot; (sacrifice). This description of &quot;Yajna-varaha&quot; was adopted in various other Puranas (like the &quot;Brahma Purana&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot;, the &quot;Padma Purana&quot;, the &quot;Venkatacala Mahatmya&quot; of the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, the &quot;Vishnudharmottara Purana&quot;), the &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, Smriti texts (including the &quot;Vishnu Smriti&quot;,), Tantras and Adi Shankara&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot; explaining the epithet &quot;Yajnanga&quot; (&quot;whose body is &quot;yajna&quot;&quot;). The &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; and the &quot;Padma Purana&quot; embeds the sacrificial description within a paean to Varaha by the sages of Janaloka after he saves the earth. Roshen Dalal describes the symbolism of his iconography based on the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; as follows:
His four feet represent the Vedas (scriptures). His tusks represent sacrificial stakes. His teeth are offerings. His mouth is the altar, the tongue is the sacrificial fire. The hair on his head denotes the sacrificial grass. The eyes represent the day and night. The head represents the seat of all. The mane represents the hymns of the Vedas. His nostrils are the oblation. His joints represent the various ceremonies. The ears are said to indicate rites (voluntary and obligatory).

Some texts like the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot;, the &quot;Harivamsa&quot; and the &quot;Padma Purana&quot; contain a panegyric - dedicated to Varaha - and a plea of rescue by the earth. They clearly identify Varaha with Vishnu at this stage. Further in the &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot; and other texts, Varaha rose from the waters carrying the earth on his tusks and restored her on the waters, where she floated like a boat. Varaha flattened the earth and divided it into seven great portions by creating mountains. Further, Brahma, identified with Vishnu, creates natural features like mountains, rivers, oceans, various worlds as well as various beings. The &quot;Venkatacala Mahatmya&quot; and the first account in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; mentions only the rescue of the earth by Varaha, omitting the creation activities attributed to him in other texts. The &quot;Venkatacala Mahatmya&quot; states that Varaha placed beneath the earth the world elephants, the serpent Shesha and the world turtle as support. At his behest, Brahma creates various beings. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; alludes to the slaying of a demon - identified with Hiranyaksha in other narratives in the Purana.

The &quot;Linga Purana&quot; and the &quot;Markendeya Purana&quot; clearly identifies Varaha, as the rescuer of the earth, with Vishnu, barring the cosmogonic myth.

===Slayer of demons===
While early references in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; to the demon Hiranyaksha do not relate him to Varaha, Vishnu is said to be taken the boar form to slay a demon named Naraka. Another late insertion describes Vishnu lifting the earth as well as defeating all the danavas (demons). Late passages start the association of Hiranyaksha with Varaha. Vishnu is praised as Varaha, the vanquisher of Hiranyaksha in three instances.

The &quot;Agni Purana&quot; mentions the obliteration of the demon Hiranyaksha as Varaha&#x27;s main purpose. The &quot;Linga Purana&quot; and the &quot;Kurma Purana&quot; narrate that the &quot;daitya&quot; (demon; lit. &quot;son of Diti&quot;) Hiranyaksa defeats the gods and entraps the earth in the subterranean realm. Taking the Varaha form, Vishnu slays the demon by piercing him by his tusks. Later, he uplifts the earth from the netherworld and restores her to her original position. The &quot;Linga Purana&quot; continues further: Later, Vishnu discards his boar body and returns to his heavenly abode of Vaikuntha; the earth cannot bear the weight of his tusks. Shiva relieves the earth by using the same as an ornament.

The &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot;, the &quot;Vayu Purana&quot;, the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; and the &quot;Padma Purana&quot; mentions that Varaha&#x27;s battle with the &quot;asura&quot;s (demons) is one of twelve in this &quot;kalpa&quot; between the gods and the demons. The &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot; states that Hiranyaksha is pierced by Varaha&#x27;s tusk, while &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; comments that Hiranyaksha is killed in this battle before Varaha rescued the earth. The &quot;Harivamsa&quot; narrates that the demons led by Hiranyaksha overpower and imprison the gods, Vishnu assumes the boar form and slays the demon-king with his Sudarshana chakra (discus) after a fierce war.

The &quot;Shrishti Khanda&quot; book of the &quot;Padma Purana&quot; provides an elaborate description of the war between the gods and the demons led by Hiranyaksha. The demon army is routed by the gods, who in turn by overpowered by the demon-king. Vishnu combats with Hiranyaksha for a hundred divine years; finally the demon expands his size and seizing the earth escapes to the netherworld. Vishnu follows him, taking up the Varaha form and rescues the earth. After engaging in a fierce mace-battle, Varaha finally beheads the demon with his discus.

In the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot;, the annihilation of Hiranyaksha appears as a cursory tale in the story of subduing of his adopted son Andhaka by Shiva. The demon king Hiranyaksha confines the earth to Patala. Vishnu becomes Varaha (identified with Sacrifice) and slaughters the demon army by trashing them by his snout, piercing by tusks and kicking by his legs. Finally, Varaha decapitates the demon king with his discus and crowns Andhaka as his successor. He picks the earth on his tusks and places it in her original place.

A detailed second account in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; narrates that Jaya and Vijaya, the doorkeepers of Vishnu&#x27;s abode Vaikuntha, were cursed by the four Kumaras to be born as demons. In their first birth, they are born as the daityas Hiranyakashipu (who is slain by another of Vishnu&#x27;s avatara of Narasimha) and Hiranyaksha as the twin sons of Diti and the sage Kashyapa. Blessed by Brahma, the king of daityas Hiranyaksha became powerful and conquered the universe. He challenges the sea god Varuna to combat, who redirects him the more powerful Vishnu. The demon confronts Vishnu as Varaha, who is rescuing the earth at the time. The demon mocks Varaha as the animal and warns him not to touch earth. Ignoring the demon&#x27;s threats, Varaha lifts the earth on his tusks. Varaha engages in a mace-duel with the demon. Varaha destroys with the discus, the demon horde created by the demon&#x27;s magic; finally slaying Hiranyaksha hitting him with his foreleg after the thousand-year battle.

The &quot;Garuda Purana&quot;, that refers to the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, alludes to the curse in the Hiranyaksha tale. The cursed Vijaya is born as the demon Hiranyaksha, begins a boon from Brahma. He takes the earth to Patala. Vishnu, as Varaha, enters Patala via the ocean. He lifts the earth with the tusks and annihilates the demon; then places the four world elephants to support the earth and settles in Srimushnam. The &quot;Uttarakhanda&quot; book of the &quot;Padma Purana&quot; also narrates about the curse of the Kumaras. Jaya and Vijaya choose three births on the earth as foes of Vishnu, rather than seven existences as his devotees to lessen the period of the curse. Hiranyaksha carries the earth away to the underworld. Varaha pierces the demon fatally by his tusk and then places the earth over the hood of the serpent and becomes the world turtle to support it. The &quot;Avantikshetra Mahatmya&quot; section of the &quot;Avantya Khanda&quot; Book of the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; also refers to the curse. The earth sinks in the waters tormented by the daityas; Varaha vanquishes Hiranyaksha.

In a passing reference in the &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot;, the &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; and &quot;Matsya Purana&quot;, Varaha is said to have slain Hiranyaksha on Mount Sumana (also called Ambikeya or Rishabha) on/ near the legendary island Jambudvipa. Besides to alluding to the raising of the earth from the waters by Varaha, the &quot;Brahmavaivarta Purana&quot; also mentions that Hiranyaksha was slain by Varaha. The &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; and the &quot;Narada Purana&quot; also refers to Varaha as the slayer of Hiranyaksha.

The &quot;Brahma Purana&quot; narrates another tale where a &quot;rakshasa&quot; (demon) named Sindhusena defeated the gods and took the sacrifice to the netherworld Rasatala. Implored by the gods, Vishnu takes the form of Varaha and enters Rasatala. He slew the demons and recovered the sacrifice holding it in his mouth (&quot;mukha&quot;), thus sacrifice known as &quot;makha&quot;. Near Brahmagiri hill in Trimbak, Varaha washed his blood-stained hands in the river Ganga (identified with the Godavari alias Gautami river); the water collected forms the sacred pond called &quot;Varaha-tirtha&quot; or &quot;Varaha-kunda&quot;.

===Saviour of the ancestors===
In an instance in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; after raising the earth, Vishnu as Varaha, shakes his tusk and three balls of mud fall in the South, which he declares as the three &quot;pinda&quot;s (riceballs) to be given to the Pitrs (ancestors). Varaha&#x27;s association with the three &quot;pinda&quot;s is reiterated in later texts like the epic&#x27;s appendix &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, the &quot;Vishnudharmottara Purana&quot; and the &quot;Brahma Purana&quot;. This tale constitutes the mythology of &quot;Pitr-yajna&quot; or Shraddha, sacrifice to the ancestors.

The &quot;Brahma Purana&quot; narrates about Varaha&#x27;s deliverance of the Pitrs (manes). Once, the Pitrs lust for Urja (also known as Svadha and Koka), the daughter of the moon-god Chandra. Cursed by Chandra, the Pitrs fall as humans on the Himalayan mountains from their elevated positions, while Koka transforms into a river in the mountains. The demons attack the Pitrs, who hides under a slab in the Koka river. Eulogized by the Pitrs, Varaha uplifted the drowning Pitrs from the river by his tusks. Then, he performs the rites of Shraddha by performing libations and &quot;pinda&quot;s to the Pitrs with the Earth acting as Chaya - his consort in the rituals. Varaha liberated the Pitrs from the curse and blessed Koka to be reborn as Svadha (the food or oblations offered to Pitrs) and become the wife of the Pitrs. Further, Narakasura (also called Bhauma) was born to the earth due to her contact with Varaha. Also, Varaha&#x27;s temple was established at Kokamukha, where Varaha freed the Pitrs.

===Children===

The &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, the &quot;Brahma Purana&quot; and the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, in the episode of the killing of the demon Narakasura by Krishna avatara of Vishnu, mentions that he was the foster son of Varaha and the earth goddess Bhumi. In some versions of the tale, Vishnu-Varaha promises the earth that he will not kill their son, without any consent. In Krishna form, Vishnu slays the demon with the support of Satyabhama, Krishna&#x27;s consort and the avatara of Bhumi.

The &quot;Brahmavaivarta Purana&quot; narrates that Varaha slew Hiranyaksha and rescued the earth from the waters. Varaha and the earth goddess were attracted to each other and made love. After they regained consciousness, Varaha worshipped the earth and decreed that the earth be worshipped at specific occasions, such as the construction of a house, lakes, wells, dams, etc. From their union, Mangala, the god of the planet Mars, their original divine son was born.

The &quot;Avantikshetra Mahatmya&quot; of the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; states that after slaying Hiranyaksha, the Shipra River springs from the heart of Varaha. Thus, the sacred river is described as the daughter of Varaha.

===In avatara listings===

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; lays the foundation for the avatar concept in Vishnu theology; the term &quot;pradurbhava&quot; (&quot;manifestation&quot;) appears in the early lists, instead the term &quot;avatara&quot;. Varaha is listed as one of the four incarnations of Narayana-Vishnu who &quot;relieve the burden of the earth&quot; in an early list; in another list which may be a later addition to the epic, Varaha is one among eight &quot;pradurbhava&quot;s. Some manuscripts of the epic expand the list to the classical ten Dashavatar list; with Varaha listed as third or fourth &quot;pradurbhava&quot;. Varaha is referred to &quot;yajna-varaha&quot; (&quot;sacrifice boar&quot;) in some instances.

The &quot;Agni Purana&quot; while narrating tales of the Dashavatara in sequence briefly mentions that the Hiranyaksa, a chief of &quot;asura&quot;s (demons) defeated the gods and captured Svarga (heaven). Vishnu, in his third avatar as Varaha, slew the demons.

The &quot;Linga Purana&quot; mentions that Vishnu takes the avatars due to a curse by the sage Bhrigu. It mentions Varaha as the third of the Dashavatara. The &quot;Narada Purana&quot;, the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; and the &quot;Padma Purana&quot; concurs placing Varaha as third of ten avatars.

The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; and &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; mention Varaha as second of 22 avatars. They say that Varaha, &quot;the lord of sacrifices&quot;, rescued the earth from the netherworld or the waters. In two other instances in the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot;, Varaha is mentioned as third of the classical Dashavatara.

The &quot;Narada Purana&quot; has a variant of Caturvyuha with Krishna, Varaha, Vamana and Balarama (Haladhara) as the four emanations.

===Other legends and textual references===

The &quot;Linga Purana&quot;, the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; and the &quot;Shaiva Khanda&quot; Book of the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; mention Vishnu taking the Varaha form in the tale of the base of Shiva as the linga (the aniconic symbol of Shiva) along with Brahma taking the Hamsa form in the tale of the tip of Shiva as the linga (the aniconic symbol of Shiva). Once, Brahma and Vishnu contest for superiority. A large, fiery pillar which was Shiva himself as the linga appears. Brahma as a &quot;hamsa&quot; (swan) flies up to find its top; while Varaha as large &quot;varaha&quot; (boar) digs down to find its bottom. However, both fail the ends of the linga. Shiva appears in the place of linga and enlightens them that he is the Supreme Being. The &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; says that Vishnu chose the boar form due to the animal&#x27;s inborn ability to burrow in this story. It also notes that the current kalpa is known as &quot;Varaha-kalpa&quot; due to Vishnu&#x27;s form as Varaha in the beginning of the kalpa when this incident happened. This tale is iconographically depicted in the Lingodbhava icon of Shiva where Shiva is shown as emerging from a fiery cosmic pillar which is he himself, while Vishnu as Varaha is seen at the base going down and Brahma as Hamsa is seen at the top going up. The Lingodbhava icon of the Shiva-worshipping Shaiva sect was aimed to counter the avatara theory of Vishnu that presented him as the Supreme Being. The icon elevated Shiva to the Supreme Being position and demoted Vishnu as inferior to Shiva by belittling the Varaha avatara of his by defeating him. Similarly, the Sharabha form of Shiva belittled Narasimha, the lion-man avatar of Vishnu by killing him.

Another legend in the minor Purana named &quot;Kalika Purana&quot; also depicts the sectarian conflicts between the Vaishnava followers of Vishnu and the Shaiva followers of Shiva. Varaha lifts Bhumi by piercing his tusks through her. He then assumes the form of the seven-hooded serpent Shesha (Ananta) and supports the earth on one of his hoods. Thereafter, Varaha and Bhumk enjoy amorous dalliance as Varaha and Varahi. They have three boar sons named Suvrtta, Kanaka, Ghora. Varaha and his three boar sons create mayhem in the world. The gods and goddesses go to Varaha to abandon his boar form. Vishnu requests Shiva to take the form of Sharabha (also called Varahaghna Murti), to kill Varaha and the three sons of his. The retinues of Sharabha and Varaha, aided by Narasimha, fight. In the war, Narasimha is killed by Sharabha. Thereafter, Varaha requests Sharabha to dismember him and create implements of sacrifice from his body parts; Sharabha complies by slaying Varaha and he kills his three sons and creates implements of sacrifice from his body.

Varaha also appears in the Shakta (Goddess-oriented) narrative in the final episode of the &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; text embedded in the &quot;Markendeya Purana&quot;. Vishnu as Varaha creates his &quot;shakti&quot; Varahi (along with other deities, together called the eight matrika goddesses) to aid the Great Goddess to fight the demon Raktabija and they kill him.

The scripture &quot;Varaha Purana&quot; is believed to be narrated by Vishnu to Bhumi, as Varaha. The Purana is devoted more to the &quot;myths and genealogies&quot; connected to the worship of Vishnu. Though Varaha is praised numerous times as the saviour of the earth from the waters, the detailed legend is not given in the Purana. Bhumi praises Vishnu as Varaha who rescued her numerous times in various avataras and sees the complete universe in his mouth, when Varaha laughs. The &quot;Varaha Upanishad&quot;, a minor Upanishad, is narrated as a sermon from Varaha to the sage Ribhu.

The &quot;Agni Purana&quot;, &quot;Brahma Purana&quot;, the &quot;Markendeya Purana,&quot; the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; say that Vishnu resides as Varaha in Ketumala-&quot;varsha&quot;, one of the regions outside the mountains surrounding Mount Meru. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; says that Vishnu dwells as Varaha with Bhumi in the Uttara Kuru-&quot;varsha&quot;. The &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; describes an island called Varaha-dvipa near Jambudvipa, where only Vishnu as Varaha is worshipped.

==Iconography==

Like Vishnu&#x27;s first two avatars – Matsya (fish) and Kurma (turtle) – the third avatara Varaha is depicted either in zoomorphic form as an animal (a wild boar), or anthropomorphically. The main difference in the anthropomorphic form portrayal is that the first two avatars are depicted with a torso of a man and the bottom half as animal, while Varaha has an animal (boar) head and a human body. The portrayal of the anthropomorphic Varaha is similar to the fourth avatar Narasimha (portrayed as a lion-headed man), who is the first avatar of Vishnu that is not completely animal.

===Textual descriptions===
The &quot;Agni Purana&quot; describes that Varaha is depicted with the human body and boar head. In one configuration, he carries a gada (mace), shankha (conch), padma (lotus) with Lakshmi on his left. In another form, he is depicted with the earth goddess on his left elbow and the serpent Shesha at his feet.

The &quot;Vishnudharmottara Purana&quot; describes the iconography of Nri-varaha (&quot;human-boar&quot;), with a human body and boar head. Varaha be depicted standing in the combative &quot;alidha&quot; pose (With a leg held straight and the other leg bent a little) on the four-armed serpent Shesha with folded arms. He holds a conch in his left land; on this elbow he supports the earth goddess who depicted with folded hands. He also holds mace, lotus and chakra (discus). He may also be depicted hurling the chakra at Hiranyaksha or raising a spear at the demon. Varaha can be also depicted in meditative posture like the sage Kapila or offering &quot;pinda&quot;s. He can depicted in battle surrounded by demons or zoomorphically as boar supporting the earth. The text prescribes Varaha worship for prosperity; the demon personifies adversity and ignorance while Varaha is wisdom, wealth and power.

The &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; describes that Varaha standing with the left foot on a turtle and the right foot on the hood of Shesha. The raised earth should be on his left elbow. His left hand is placed on his Shakti (consort) on his left; while he holds a lotus and mace. The lokapala deities should surround him, worshipping him.

The &quot;Narada Purana&quot; recommends Varaha be pictured as golden in complexion, having the earth on his white tusks and holding an iron-club, a conch, a discus, a sword, a javelin in his hands and making the &quot;abhayamudra&quot; (hand gesture of assurance).

The &quot;Venkatacala Mahatmya&quot; of the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; mentions that the boar-faced, four-armed Varaha holds the discus and the conch and makes the gestures of blessing (&quot;varadamudra&quot;) and assurance. He wears various ornaments including the Kaustubha jewel and yellow garments. The &quot;srivatsa&quot; symbol is on his chest. The earth goddess is seated on his left lap.

===Depictions===

In the zoomorphic form, Varaha is often depicted as a free-standing boar colossus, for example, the monolithic sculpture of Varaha in Khajuraho (c. 900–925) made in sandstone, is long and high. The sculpture may not resemble a boar realistically, and may have his features altered for stylistic purposes. The earth, personified as the goddess Bhumi, clings to one of Varaha&#x27;s tusks. Often the colossus is decorated by miniature figurines of deities, other celestail beings, sages, anthropomorphic planets, stars, other world creatures appearing all over his body, which signify the whole of creation. The goddess of speech and knowledge, Sarasvati is often depicted on his tongue, while Brahma is often depicted on his head with Shiva and Parvati on his forehead and neck. Besides Khajuraho, such sculptures are found in Eran, Muradpur, Badoh, Gwalior, Jhansi, Apasadh.
In the anthropomorphic form, Varaha often has a stylized boar face, like the zoomorphic models. The snout may be shorter. The position and size of the tusks may also be altered. The ears, cheeks, and eyes are generally based on human ones. Early sculptors in Udayagiri and Eran faced the issue of how to attach the boar head to the human body and did not show a human neck. However, in Badami, the problem was resolved by including a human neck. While some sculptures show a mane, it is dropped and replaced by a high conical crown – typical of Vishnu iconography – in others. Varaha sculptures generally look up to the right; there are very rare instances of left-facing Varaha depictions.

Varaha has four arms, two of which hold the Sudarshana Chakra (discus) and Panchajanya (conch), while the other two hold a gada (mace), a sword, or a lotus or one of them makes the &quot;varadamudra&quot; (gesture of blessing). Varaha may be depicted with all of Vishnu&#x27;a attributes in his four hands: the Sudarshana Chakra, the Panchajanya, the gada and the lotus. Sometimes, Varaha may carry only two of Vishnu&#x27;s attributes: a shankha and the gada personified as a female called Gadadevi. Varaha may also wear a &quot;vanamala&quot; - a garland of forest flowers, which is a regular characteristic in Vishnu icons. Varaha is often shown with a bulky physique and in a heroic pose. He is often depicted triumphantly emerging from the ocean as he rescues the earth.

The earth may be shown as the goddess Bhumi in Indian sculpture. Bhumi is often shown as a small figure in the icon. She may be seated on or dangling from one of Varaha&#x27;s tusks, or is seated on the corner of his folded elbow or his shoulder and supports herself against the tusk or the snout, as being lifted from the waters. In later Indian paintings, the whole earth or a part of it is depicted lifted up by Varaha&#x27;s tusks. In Mahabalipuram, a rare portrayal shows an affectionate Varaha looking down to Bhumi, who he carries in his arms. The earth may be portrayed as a globe, a flat stretch of mountainous land or an elaborate forest landscape with buildings, temples, humans, birds, and animals. The defeated demon may be depicted trampled under Varaha&#x27;s feet or being killed in combat by Varaha. Nagas (snake gods) and their consorts Naginis (snake goddesses), residents of the underworld, may be depicted as swimming in the ocean with hands folded as a mark of devotion. Varaha may be also depicted standing on a snake or other minor creatures, denoting the cosmic waters. Sometimes, Lakshmi - Vishnu&#x27;s primary consort - is depicted in the scene near the right foot of Varaha.

The Udayagiri Varaha panel is an example of an elaborate depiction of Varaha legend. It presents the goddess earth as the dangling woman, the hero as the colossal giant. His success is cheered by a galaxy of the divine as well as human characters valued and revered in the 4th-century. Their iconography of individual characters is found in Hindu texts.

Two iconographical forms of Varaha are popular. Yajna Varaha – denoting &quot;yajna&quot; (sacrifice) – is seated on a lion-throne and flanked by Bhumi and Lakshmi. As Pralaya Varaha – indicative of lifting the earth from the stage of the &quot;pralaya&quot; (the dissolution of the universe) – he is depicted only with Bhumi. Varaha may be depicted with Lakshmi alone too. In such sculptures, he may be depicted identically to Vishnu in terms of iconography with Vishnu&#x27;s attributes; the boar head identifying the icon as Varaha. Lakshmi may be seated on his thigh in such portrayals.

Varaha often features in the Dashavatara stele – where the ten major avatars of Vishnu are portrayed – sometimes surrounding Vishnu. In the Vaikuntha Vishnu (four-headed Vishnu) images, the boar is shown as the left head. Varaha&#x27;s shakti (energy or consort) is the Matrika (mother goddess) Varahi, who is depicted with a boar head like the god. The &quot;Vishnudharmottara Purana&quot; prescribes Varaha be depicted as a boar in the Lingodbhava icon of Shiva.

==Evolution==
The earliest Varaha images are found in Mathura, dating to the 1st and 2nd century CE. The Gupta era (4th–6th century) in Central India temples and archaeological sites have yielded a large number of Varaha sculptures and inscriptions; signifying cult worship of the deity in this period. These include the anthropomorphic version in Udayagiri Caves and the zoomorphic version in Eran. Other early sculptures exist in the cave temples in Badami in Karnataka (6th century) and Varaha Cave Temple in Mahabalipuram (7th century); both in South India and Ellora Caves (7th century) in Western India. By the 7th century, images of Varaha were found in all regions of India, including Kashmir in the north. By the 10th century, temples dedicated to Varaha were established in Khajuraho (existent, but worship has ceased), Udaipur, Jhansi (now in ruins) etc. The boar was celebrated in the first millennium as a &quot;symbol of potency&quot;.

The Chalukya dynasty (543–753) was the first dynasty to adopt Varaha in their crest and minted coins with Varaha on it. The Gurjara-Pratihara king Mihira Bhoja (836–885 CE) assumed the title of &quot;Adi-varaha&quot; and also minted coins depicting the Varaha image. Varaha was also adopted as a part of royal insignia by the Chola (4th century BCE–1279 CE) and Vijayanagara Empires (1336–1646 CE) of South India. In Karnataka, a zoomorphic image of Varaha is found in a carving on a pillar in Aihole, which is interpreted as the Vijayanagara emblem, as it is seen along with signs of a cross marked Sun, a disc and a conch.

However, the boar and its relative the pig started being seen as polluting since the 12th century, due to Muslim influence on India. Muslims consider the pig unclean. This led to a &quot;change of attitude&quot; towards Varaha. While Varaha once enjoyed cult following particularly in Central India, his worship has declined significantly today.

According to historian Dr. Suniti Kumar Chatterjee, Boro people trace their mythological origins to Varaha.

Some academics believe the Varaha avatara is a single-horned rhino, rather than a boar although it was disproven .

==Symbolism==
Varaha represents yajna (sacrifice), as the eternal upholder of the earth. Varaha is the embodiment of the Supreme Being who brings order amidst chaos in the world by ritual sacrifice. Various scriptures reiterate Varaha&#x27;s identification with sacrifice, comparing his various body parts to implements and participants of a sacrifice. According to H.H. Wilson, the legend of Varaha symbolizes the resurrection of the earth from sin by sacred rituals. Vishnu is identified with sacrifice; Bhatta Bhaskara identifies Varaha with the &quot;sutya&quot; day in &quot;soma&quot; sacrifices, when the ritual drink of &quot;soma&quot; was consumed. A theory suggests that Varaha&#x27;s identification with Sacrifice streams from the early use of a boar as sacrificial animal.

In royal depictions of Varaha, the icon is interpreted to allude to the Rajasuya sacrifice for royal consecration or Ashvamedha sacrifice to establish to establish sovereignty. The Varaha icon describes the role of a warrior king, rescuing goddess earth (kingdom) from a demon who kidnaps her, torments her and the inhabitants. It is a symbolism for the battle between right versus wrong, good versus evil, and of someone willing to go to the depths and do what is necessary to rescue the good, the right, the dharma. He is the protector of the innocent goddess and the weak who have been imprisoned by the demonic forces. The sculpture typically show the symbolic scene of the return of Varaha after he had successfully killed the oppressive demon Hiranyaksha, found and rescued goddess earth (Prithivi, Bhumi), and the goddess is back safely. Whether in the zoomorphic form or the anthropomorphic form, the victorious hero Varaha is accompanied by sages and saints of Hinduism, all gods including Shiva and Brahma. This symbolizes that just warriors must protect the weak and the bearers of all forms of knowledge and that the gods approve of and cheer on the rescue.

Various holy books state that the boar form was taken to rescue the earth from the primordial waters, as the animal likes to play in the water. Wilson speculates that the legend may be an allusion to a deluge or evolution of &quot;lacustrine&quot; mammals in the earth&#x27;s early history.

Another theory associates Varaha with tilling of the land for agriculture. When the boar tills the land with its tusk in nature, plants sprouts in the spot quickly. In the context of agriculture, Roy associates Varaha with the cloud, referring the Vedic etymology of &quot;varaha&quot; and similar to the Germanic association of the pig with &quot;cloud, thunder and storm&quot;. The boar, as the cloud, ends the demon of summer or drought.

Various theories associate the Orion constellation with Varaha; though the constellation is also associated with other deities. In autumn, Vishnu or Prajapati (the Sun) enters the southern hemisphere (equated with the netherworld or the ocean), while returns as Orion, the boar, on the spring equinox.

In the Vaikuntha Chaturmurti icon when associated with the Chaturvyuha concept, Varaha is associated with the hero Aniruddha and energy.

==Worship==

The &quot;Agni Purana&quot; prescribes that Varaha be in the north-east direction in Vishnu temples or worship. Installation of the icon of Varaha is said to bestow one with sovereignty, prosperity and &quot;moksha&quot; (emancipation).

The &quot;Narada Purana&quot; mentions Varaha&#x27;s mantra &quot;Om namo Bhagavate Varaharupaya Bhurbhuvassvah pataye Bhupatitvam me dehi dadapaya svaha&quot; and recommends Varaha to be worshipped for kingship. A shorter mantra &quot;Om bhu varahay namah&quot; is also given for gaining peosperity. Varaha is prescribed to be worshipped for &quot;ucchatana&quot; (eradication) of foes, ghosts, poison, disease, &quot;evil planets&quot;. The one-syllabed mantra &quot;hum&quot; for Varaha is also noted. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; invokes Varaha for protection while travelling. The &quot;Venkatacala Mahatmya&quot; of the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; mentions the mantra of Varaha as &quot;Om Namah Srivarahaya Dharanyuddharanaya Ca Svaha&quot; (&quot;Saluation to Varaha who lifted the Earth&quot;). The &quot;Agni Purana&quot; and the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; associate the mantra &quot;Bhuh&quot; with Varaha.

The &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; recommends the worship of Varaha for sovereignty. A &quot;vrata&quot; involving the worship of a gold Varaha image on ekadashi (eleventh lunar day) in bright half of Magha month (i.e. Bhaimi Ekadakshi), is told in the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; and the &quot;Narada Purana&quot;. Varaha Jayanti, the birthday of Varaha, is celebrated on the third lunar day in the bright fortnight of the Bhadrapada month. The worship of Varaha and overnight vigil (jagran) with Vishnu tales being told are prescribed on this day.

The &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot; embedded in the thirteenth Book &quot;Anushasana Parva&quot; of the epic is a hymn listing the thousand names of Vishnu. The Varaha legend is alluded to in the following epithets: &quot;Mahibharta&quot; (&quot;husband of the earth&quot;), &quot;Dharanidara&quot; (&quot;one who upholds the earth&quot;, may also refer to other Vishnu forms - Kurma, Shesha or Vishnu in general), &quot;Maha-varaha&quot; (&quot;the great boar&quot;), &quot;Kundara&quot; (&quot;One who pierced the earth&quot;), &quot;Brihadrupa&quot; (&quot;who takes form of a boar&quot;), &quot;Yajnanga&quot; (&quot;whose body is &quot;yajna&quot; or sacrifice) and &quot;Vaikhana&quot; (&quot;one who dug the earth&quot;). The epithet &quot;Kapindra&quot; (&quot;Kapi-Lord&quot;) may refer to Varaha or Rama avatar, depending the interpretation of the word &quot;kapi&quot; as boar or monkey respectively. The title &quot;Shringi&quot; (&quot;horned&quot;) generally interpreted as Matsya, may also refer to Varaha. The &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot; version from the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; mentions &quot;Shukura&quot; (Boar) as an epithet of Vishnu. The &quot;Padma Purana&quot; includes Varaha in a hundred-name hymn of Vishnu. The thousand-name hymn version in the &quot;Padma Purana&quot; mentions that Vishnu is Varaha, the protector of sacrifices and destroyer of those who obstruct them.

===Temples===

The most prominent temple of Varaha is the Sri Varahaswami Temple in Tirumala, Andhra Pradesh. It is located on the shores of a temple pond, called the Svami Pushkarini, in Tirumala, near Tirupati; to the north of the Tirumala Venkateshvara Temple (another temple of Vishnu in the form of Venkateshvara). The region is called &quot;Adi-Varaha Kshestra&quot;, the abode of Varaha. The legend of the place is as follows: at the end of Satya Yuga (the first in the cycle of four aeons; the present one is the fourth aeon), devotees of Varaha requested him to stay on earth, so Varaha ordered his mount Garuda to bring his divine garden Kridachala from his abode Vaikuntha to Venkata hills, Tirumala. Venkateswara is described as having taken the permission of Varaha to reside in these hills, where his chief temple, Tirumala Venkateswara Temple, stands. Hence, pilgrims are prescribed to worship Varaha first and then Venkateswara. In the &quot;Atri Samhita&quot; (&quot;Samurtarchanadhikara&quot;), Varaha is described to be worshipped in three forms here: Adi Varaha, Pralaya Varaha and Yajna Varaha. The image in the sanctum is of Adi Varaha.

The &quot;Venkatacala Mahatmya&quot; of the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; says that Varaha resides with Bhudevi on the banks of the Svami Pushkarini lake, Tirupati. Varaha is said to rest there in the jungle after rescuing the earth. Varaha roams in the forest near the lake as a lustrous boar. A tribal chief called Vasu follows the boar, who enters an anthill. Vasu digs the anthill but cannot trace the boar, finally swoons due to fatigue. His son finds him. Varaha possesses Vasu and instructs him to inform the king Tondaman to build his temple at the place. Varaha is also presented as the narrator of the tale of Venkateshvara, whose chief temple is in Tirupati, to the Earth in a part of &quot;Venkatacala Mahatmya&quot;.

Another important temple is the Bhuvarahaswami Temple in Srimushnam, Tamil Nadu. It was built in the late 16th century by Krishnappa II, a Thanjavur Nayak ruler. The image of Varaha is considered a swayambhu (self-manifested) image, one of the eight self-manifested &quot;Swayamvyakta kshetra&quot;s. An inscription in the prakaram (circumambulating passage around the main shrine) quoting from the legend of the &quot;Srimushna Mahatmaya&quot; (a local legend) mentions the piety one derives in observing festivals during the 12 months of the year when the sun enters a particular zodiacal sign. This temple is venerated by Hindus and Muslims alike. Both communities take the utsava murti (festival image) in procession in the annual temple festival in the Tamil month of Masi (February–March). The god is credited with many miracles and called &quot;Varaha sahib&quot; by Muslims.

The Varaha temple in Pushkar is also included in the &quot;Swayamvyakta kshetra&quot; list. The &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; says Varaha performs a sacrifice near Pushkar lake in every Kartika month. The &quot;Padma Purana&quot; narrates that Brahma organizes a great sacrifice in Pushkar for the benefit of the universe. Varaha, appears there as the embodiment of Sacrifice (his sacrificial attributes are reiterated), to protect the sacrifice against any obstruction or evil. Brahma requests Varaha to always reside in and protect the sacred place of Pushkar (identified with Kokamukha).
Varaha shrines are also included in Divya Desams (a list of 108 abodes of Vishnu). They include Adi Varaha Perumal shrine Tirukkalvanoor, located in the Kamakshi Amman Temple complex, Kanchipuram and Thiruvidandai, 15 km from Mahabalipuram.

Another pilgrimage place where Varaha resides is mentioned in the &quot;Brahma Purana&quot; near Vaitarana river and Viraja temple, Utkala (modern-day Odisha) (See Varahanatha Temple).

In Muradpur in West Bengal, worship is offered to an in-situ zoomorphic image of Varaha (8th century), one of the earliest known images of Varaha. A 7th century anthropomorphic Varaha image of Apasadh is still worshipped in a relatively modern temple. Other temples dedicated to Varaha are located across India in the states of Andhra Pradesh (including Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha temple, Simhachalam dedicated to a combined form of Varaha and Narasimha), in Haryana Pradesh at Baraha Kalan, and Lakshmi Varaha Temple, in Karnataka at Maravanthe and Kallahalli, Panniyur Sri Varahamurthy Temple in Kerala, Sreevaraham Lakshmi Varaha temple, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, Sree Varaha Swamy Temple, Varapuzha in Ernakulam, Kerala, Azheekal Sree Varaha Temple in Ernakulam, Kerala, in Majholi, Madhya Pradesh, in Odisha at Lakshmi Varaha Temple, Aul, in Tamil Nadu and in Uttar Pradesh. A Varaha temple is also located in Mysore Palace premises at Mysore, Karnataka. The Varahashyam temple in Bhinmal, Rajasthan also has an 8 ft Varaha icon.

<text>Hiranyaksha (, ), also known as Hiranyanetra () was an asura as per Hindu mythology. He is described to have submerged the earth and terrorised the three worlds. He was slain by the Varaha (wild boar) avatar of Vishnu, who rescued the earth goddess Bhumi and restored order to the earth.

==Legend==

Some of the Puranas present Hiranyaksha as the son of Diti and Kashyapa. Having performed austerities to propitiate Brahma, Hiranyaksha received the boon of invulnerability of meeting his death by neither any god, man, nor beast.

Having received this boon, Hiranyaksha assaulted the defenceless Bhumi and pulled her deep beneath the cosmic ocean. The other deities appealed to Vishnu to save the earth goddess and creation. Answering their plea, Vishnu assumed the avatar of a wild boar (Varaha) to rescue the goddess. Hiranyaksha attempted to obstruct him, after which he was slain by Vishnu.

Hiranyaksha had an elder brother named Hiranyakashipu, who similarly achieved a boon of invulnerability and conquered the three worlds, seeking vengeance for his brother&#x27;s death. He tried to persecute and abuse his son Prahlada for being a faithful devotee of Vishnu. While Hiranyaksha was slain by Varaha (the boar avatar of Vishnu), Hiranyakashipu was killed by Narasimha (the man-lion avatar of Vishnu). Their younger sister was Holika, who tried to kill her nephew by attempting to immolate him but got burnt herself and killed.

In some texts including the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, Hiranyaksha is an incarnation of one of the dvarapalas (gatekeepers) of Vishnu named Vijaya. Vishnu&#x27;s guardians Jaya-Vijaya, were cursed by the Four Kumaras (Brahma&#x27;s sons) to incarnate on earth either three times as enemies of Vishnu, or seven times as his devotees. They chose to take birth on earth thrice. During their first births (during the Satya Yuga), they were born as Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha. During their second births, (during the Treta Yuga), they were born as Ravana and Kumbhakarna. During their third births (during the Dvapara Yuga), they were born as Shishupala and Dantavakra.

==Origins and significance==

This Hindu legend has roots in the Vedic literature such as Taittariya Samhita and Shatapatha Brahmana, and is found in many post-Vedic texts. These legends depict the earth goddess (Bhumi or Prithvi) in an existential crisis, where neither she nor the life she supports can survive. She is drowning and overwhelmed in the cosmic ocean. Vishnu emerges in the form of a man-boar avatar. He, as the protagonist of the legend, descends into the ocean and finds her. She hangs onto his tusk, and he lifts her out to safety. Good wins, the crisis ends, and Vishnu once again fulfills his cosmic duty. The Varaha legend has been one of many archetypal legends in the Hindu text embedded with the theme of right versus wrong, good versus evil symbolism, and of someone willing to go to the depths and do what is necessary to rescue the righteous and uphold dharma.

<text>Louis Barbarin (nickname Lil Barb; October 24, 1902 – May 12, 1997) was a New Orleans jazz drummer.

==Early life==
Barbarin was born in New Orleans on October 24, 1902. His father was Isidore Barbarin, and his brothers Paul, Lucien, and William all became musicians. He studied under the drummer Louis Cottrell, Sr.

==Later life and career==
Barbarin &quot;joined the first Onward Brass Band around 1918, when Manuel Perez was the leader. He played at dances with Kid Rena, the trombonist Jack Carey, and Punch Miller, and on excursion boats with Sidney Desvigne.&quot; He joined Papa Celestin&#x27;s band in 1937 and stayed until Celestin&#x27;s death. The band was then taken over by banjoist Albert French, and Barbarin remained as the drummer. He often recorded with each of the bands.

Barbarin sang in a quartet, the Four Tones, after World War II, then worked with Miller in the 1950s and 1960s. He played in several bands in the mid-to-late 1960s, and toured extensively in the 1970s, including in Europe. He stopped playing in 1982, and died in New Orleans on May 12, 1997. He was interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in New Orleans.

== Personal life ==
Barbarin was Catholic.

<doc id="100127" wikidata="Q37103" url="?curid=100127" title="Florence Nightingale">
<text>Florence Nightingale (; 12 May 1820 – 13 August 1910) was an English social reformer, statistician and the founder of modern nursing. Nightingale came to prominence while serving as a manager and trainer of nurses during the Crimean War, in which she organised care for wounded soldiers at Constantinople. She significantly reduced death rates by improving hygiene and living standards. Nightingale gave nursing a favourable reputation and became an icon of Victorian culture, especially in the persona of &quot;The Lady with the Lamp&quot; making rounds of wounded soldiers at night.

Recent commentators have asserted that Nightingale&#x27;s Crimean War achievements were exaggerated by the media at the time, but critics agree on the importance of her later work in professionalising nursing roles for women. In 1860, she laid the foundation of professional nursing with the establishment of her nursing school at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in London. It was the first secular nursing school in the world and is now part of King&#x27;s College London. In recognition of her pioneering work in nursing, the Nightingale Pledge taken by new nurses, and the Florence Nightingale Medal, the highest international distinction a nurse can achieve, were named in her honour, and the annual International Nurses Day is celebrated on her birthday. Her social reforms included improving healthcare for all sections of British society, advocating better hunger relief in India, helping to abolish prostitution laws that were harsh for women, and expanding the acceptable forms of female participation in the workforce.

Nightingale was an innovator in statistics; she represented her analysis in graphical forms to ease drawing conclusions and actionables from data. She is famous for usage of the polar area diagram, also called the Nightingale rose diagram, which is equivalent to a modern circular histogram. This diagram is still regularly used in data visualisation.

Nightingale was a prodigious and versatile writer. In her lifetime, much of her published work was concerned with spreading medical knowledge. Some of her tracts were written in simple English so that they could easily be understood by those with poor literary skills. She was also a pioneer in data visualisation with the use of infographics, using graphical presentations of statistical data in an effective way. Much of her writing, including her extensive work on religion and mysticism, has only been published posthumously.

== Early life ==

Florence Nightingale was born on 12 May 1820 into a wealthy and well-connected British family at the &quot;Villa Colombaia&quot;, in Florence, Tuscany, Italy, and was named after the city of her birth. Florence&#x27;s older sister Frances Parthenope had similarly been named after her place of birth, &quot;Parthenope&quot;, a Greek settlement now part of the city of Naples. The family moved back to England in 1821, with Nightingale being brought up in the family&#x27;s homes at Embley, Hampshire, and Lea Hurst, Derbyshire.

Florence inherited a liberal-humanitarian outlook from both sides of her family. Her parents were William Edward Nightingale, born William Edward Shore (1794–1874) and Frances (&quot;Fanny&quot;) Nightingale ( Smith; 1788–1880). William&#x27;s mother Mary ( Evans) was the niece of Peter Nightingale, under the terms of whose will William inherited his estate at Lea Hurst, and assumed the name and arms of Nightingale. Fanny&#x27;s father (Florence&#x27;s maternal grandfather) was the abolitionist and Unitarian William Smith. Nightingale&#x27;s father educated her.

A BBC documentary reported that &quot;Florence and her older sister Parthenope benefited from their father&#x27;s advanced ideas about women&#x27;s education. They studied history, mathematics, Italian, classical literature, and philosophy, and from an early age Florence, who was the more academic of the two girls, displayed an extraordinary ability for collecting and analysing data which she would use to great effect in later life.&quot;

In 1838, her father took the family on a tour in Europe where she was introduced to the English-born Parisian hostess Mary Clarke, with whom Florence bonded. She recorded that &quot;Clarkey&quot; was a stimulating hostess who did not care for her appearance, and while her ideas did not always agree with those of her guests, &quot;she was incapable of boring anyone.&quot; Her behaviour was said to be exasperating and eccentric and she had little respect for upper-class British women, whom she regarded generally as inconsequential. She said that if given the choice between being a woman or a galley slave, then she would choose the freedom of the galleys. She generally rejected female company and spent her time with male intellectuals. Clarke made an exception, however, in the case of the Nightingale family and Florence in particular. She and Florence were to remain close friends for 40 years despite their 27-year age difference. Clarke demonstrated that women could be equal to men, an idea that Florence had not learnt from her mother.

Nightingale underwent the first of several experiences that she believed were calls from God in February 1837 while at Embley Park, prompting a strong desire to devote her life to the service of others. In her youth she was respectful of her family&#x27;s opposition to her working as a nurse, only announcing her decision to enter the field in 1844. Despite the anger and distress of her mother and sister, she rejected the expected role for a woman of her status to become a wife and mother. Nightingale worked hard to educate herself in the art and science of nursing, in the face of opposition from her family and the restrictive social code for affluent young English women.

As a young woman, Nightingale was described as attractive, slender, and graceful. While her demeanour was often severe, she was said to be very charming and to possess a radiant smile. Her most persistent suitor was the politician and poet Richard Monckton Milnes, but after a nine-year courtship, she rejected him, convinced that marriage would interfere with her ability to follow her calling to nursing.

In Rome in 1847, she met Sidney Herbert, a politician who had been Secretary at War (1845–1846) who was on his honeymoon. He and Nightingale became lifelong close friends. Herbert would be Secretary of War again during the Crimean War when he and his wife would be instrumental in facilitating Nightingale&#x27;s nursing work in Crimea. She became Herbert&#x27;s key adviser throughout his political career, though she was accused by some of having hastened Herbert&#x27;s death from Bright&#x27;s disease in 1861 because of the pressure her programme of reform placed on him. Nightingale also much later had strong relations with academic Benjamin Jowett, who may have wanted to marry her.

Nightingale continued her travels (now with Charles and Selina Bracebridge) as far as Greece and Egypt. While in Athens, Greece, Nightingale rescued a juvenile little owl from a group of children who were tormenting it, and she named the owl Athena. Nightingale often carried the owl in her pocket, until the pet died (shortly before Nightingale left for Crimea).

Her writings on Egypt, in particular, are testimony to her learning, literary skill, and philosophy of life. Sailing up the Nile as far as Abu Simbel in January 1850, she wrote of the Abu Simbel temples, &quot;Sublime in the highest style of intellectual beauty, intellect without effort, without suffering ... not a feature is correct — but the whole effect is more expressive of spiritual grandeur than anything I could have imagined. It makes the impression upon one that thousands of voices do, uniting in one unanimous simultaneous feeling of enthusiasm or emotion, which is said to overcome the strongest man.&quot;

At Thebes, she wrote of being &quot;called to God&quot;, while a week later near Cairo she wrote in her diary (as distinct from her far longer letters that her elder sister Parthenope was to print after her return): &quot;God called me in the morning and asked me would I do good for him alone without reputation.&quot; Later in 1850, she visited the Lutheran religious community at Kaiserswerth-am-Rhein in Germany, where she observed Pastor Theodor Fliedner and the deaconesses working for the sick and the deprived. She regarded the experience as a turning point in her life and issued her findings anonymously in 1851; &quot;The Institution of Kaiserswerth on the Rhine, for the Practical Training of Deaconesses, etc.&quot; was her first published work. She also received four months of medical training at the institute, which formed the basis for her later care.

On 22 August 1853, Nightingale took the post of superintendent at the Institute for the Care of Sick Gentlewomen in Upper Harley Street, London, a position she held until October 1854. Her father had given her an annual income of £500 (roughly £40,000/US$65,000 in present terms), which allowed her to live comfortably and to pursue her career.

== Crimean War ==
Florence Nightingale&#x27;s most famous contribution came during the Crimean War, which became her central focus when reports got back to Britain about the horrific conditions for the wounded at the military hospital on the Asiatic side of the Bosporus, opposite Constantinople, at Scutari (modern-day Üsküdar in Istanbul). Britain and France entered the war against Russia on the side of the Ottoman Empire. On 21 October 1854, she and the staff of 38 women volunteer nurses including her head nurse Eliza Roberts and her aunt Mai Smith, and 15 Catholic nuns (mobilised by Henry Edward Manning) were sent (under the authorisation of Sidney Herbert) to the Ottoman Empire. On the way, Nightingale was assisted in Paris by her friend Mary Clarke. The volunteer nurses worked about away from the main British camp across the Black Sea at Balaklava, in the Crimea.

Nightingale arrived at Selimiye Barracks in Scutari early in November 1854. Her team found that poor care for wounded soldiers was being delivered by overworked medical staff in the face of official indifference. Medicines were in short supply, hygiene was being neglected, and mass infections were common, many of them fatal. There was no equipment to process food for the patients:

After Nightingale sent a plea to &quot;The Times&quot; for a government solution to the poor condition of the facilities, the British Government commissioned Isambard Kingdom Brunel to design a prefabricated hospital that could be built in England and shipped to the Dardanelles. The result was Renkioi Hospital, a civilian facility that, under the management of Edmund Alexander Parkes, had a death rate less than one tenth of that of Scutari.

Stephen Paget in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; asserted that Nightingale reduced the death rate from 42% to 2%, either by making improvements in hygiene herself, or by calling for the Sanitary Commission. For example, Nightingale implemented handwashing in the hospital where she worked.
During her first winter at Scutari, 4,077 soldiers died there. Ten times more soldiers died from illnesses such as typhus, typhoid, cholera, and dysentery than from battle wounds. With overcrowding, defective sewers and lack of ventilation, the Sanitary Commission had to be sent out by the British government to Scutari in March 1855, almost six months after Nightingale had arrived. The commission flushed out the sewers and improved ventilation. Death rates were sharply reduced, but she never claimed credit for helping to reduce the death rate. Head Nurse Eliza Roberts nursed Nightingale through her critical illness of May 1855.

In 2001 and 2008 the BBC released documentaries that were critical of Nightingale&#x27;s performance in the Crimean War, as were some follow-up articles published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;. Nightingale scholar Lynn McDonald has dismissed these criticisms as &quot;often preposterous&quot;, arguing they are not supported by the primary sources.

Nightingale still believed that the death rates were due to poor nutrition, lack of supplies, stale air, and overworking of the soldiers. After she returned to Britain and began collecting evidence before the Royal Commission on the Health of the Army, she came to believe that most of the soldiers at the hospital were killed by poor living conditions. This experience influenced her later career when she advocated sanitary living conditions as of great importance. Consequently, she reduced peacetime deaths in the army and turned her attention to the sanitary design of hospitals and the introduction of sanitation in working-class homes (see Statistics and Sanitary Reform).
According to some secondary sources, Nightingale had a frosty relationship with her fellow nurse Mary Seacole, who ran a hotel/hospital for officers. Seacole&#x27;s own memoir, &quot;Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands&quot;, records only one, friendly, meeting with her, when she asked her for a bed for the night and got it; Seacole was in Scutari en route to the Crimea to join her business partner and start their business. However, Seacole pointed out that when she tried to join Nightingale&#x27;s group, one of Nightingale&#x27;s colleagues rebuffed her, and Seacole inferred that racism was at the root of that rebuttal. Nightingale told her brother-in-law, in a private letter, that she was worried about contact between her work and Seacole&#x27;s business, claiming that while &quot;she was very kind to the men and, what is more, to the Officers – and did some good (she) made many drunk&quot;. Nightingale reportedly wrote, &quot;I had the greatest difficulty in repelling Mrs. Seacole&#x27;s advances, and in preventing association between her and my nurses (absolutely out of the question!) ... Anyone who employs Mrs. Seacole will introduce much kindness – also much drunkenness and improper conduct&quot;. On the other hand, Seacole told the French chef Alexis Soyer that &quot;You must know, M Soyer, that Miss Nightingale is very fond of me. When I passed through Scutari, she very kindly gave me board and lodging.&quot;

The arrival of two waves of Irish nuns, the Sisters of Mercy, to assist with nursing duties at Scutari met with different responses from Nightingale. Mary Clare Moore headed the first wave and placed herself and her Sisters under the authority of Nightingale. The two were to remain friends for the rest of their lives. The second wave, headed by Mary Francis Bridgeman met with a cooler reception as Bridgeman refused to give up her authority over her Sisters to Nightingale while at the same time not trusting Nightingale, whom she regarded as ambitious.

=== The Lady with the Lamp ===
During the Crimean War, Nightingale gained the nickname &quot;The Lady with the Lamp&quot; from a phrase in a report in &quot;The Times&quot;:

The phrase was further popularised by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s 1857 poem &quot;Santa Filomena&quot;:

Nightingale was nicknamed &quot;the lady with the hammer&quot; by the troops after using a hammer to break into locked storage to access medicine to treat the wounded. However, Russell thought the behaviour was unladylike, and invented an alternative, leading to &quot;The Lady with the Lamp&quot;.

== Later career ==
In the Crimea on 29 November 1855, the Nightingale Fund was established for the training of nurses during a public meeting to recognise Nightingale for her work in the war. There was an outpouring of generous donations. Sidney Herbert served as honorary secretary of the fund and the Duke of Cambridge was chairman. In her 1856 letters she described spas in the Ottoman Empire, detailing the health conditions, physical descriptions, dietary information, and other vital details of patients whom she directed there. She noted that the treatment there was significantly less expensive than in Switzerland.
Nightingale had £45,000 at her disposal from the Nightingale Fund to set up the first nursing school, the Nightingale Training School, at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital on 9 July 1860. The first trained Nightingale nurses began work on 16 May 1865 at the Liverpool Workhouse Infirmary. Now called the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, the school is part of King&#x27;s College London. In 1866 she said the Royal Buckinghamshire Hospital in Aylesbury near her sister&#x27;s home Claydon House would be &quot;the most beautiful hospital in England&quot;, and in 1868 called it &quot;an excellent model to follow&quot;.

Nightingale wrote &quot;Notes on Nursing&quot; (1859). The book served as the cornerstone of the curriculum at the Nightingale School and other nursing schools, though it was written specifically for the education of those nursing at home. Nightingale wrote, &quot;Every day sanitary knowledge, or the knowledge of nursing, or in other words, of how to put the constitution in such a state as that it will have no disease, or that it can recover from disease, takes a higher place. It is recognised as the knowledge which every one ought to have – distinct from medical knowledge, which only a profession can have&quot;.

&quot;Notes on Nursing&quot; also sold well to the general reading public and is considered a classic introduction to nursing. Nightingale spent the rest of her life promoting and organising the nursing profession. In the introduction to the 1974 edition, Joan Quixley of the Nightingale School of Nursing wrote: &quot;The book was the first of its kind ever to be written. It appeared at a time when the simple rules of health were only beginning to be known, when its topics were of vital importance not only for the well-being and recovery of patients, when hospitals were riddled with infection, when nurses were still mainly regarded as ignorant, uneducated persons. The book has, inevitably, its place in the history of nursing, for it was written by the founder of modern nursing&quot;.

As Mark Bostridge has demonstrated, one of Nightingale&#x27;s signal achievements was the introduction of trained nurses into the workhouse system in Britain from the 1860s onwards. This meant that sick paupers were no longer being cared for by other, able-bodied paupers, but by properly trained nursing staff. In the first half of the 19th century, nurses were usually former servants or widows who found no other job and therefore were forced to earn their living by this work. Charles Dickens caricatured the standard of care in his 1843–1844 published novel &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; in the figure of Sarah Gamp as being incompetent, negligent, alcoholic and corrupt. According to Caroline Worthington, director of the Florence Nightingale Museum, &quot;When she [Nightingale] started out there was no such thing as nursing. The Dickens character Sarah Gamp, who was more interested in drinking gin than looking after her patients, was only a mild exaggeration. Hospitals were places of last resort where the floors were laid with straw to soak up the blood. Florence transformed nursing when she got back [from Crimea]. She had access to people in high places and she used it to get things done. Florence was stubborn, opinionated, and forthright but she had to be those things in order to achieve all that she did.&quot;
Though Nightingale is sometimes said to have denied the theory of infection for her entire life, a 2008 biography disagrees, saying that she was simply opposed to a precursor of germ theory known as contagionism. This theory held that diseases could only be transmitted by touch. Before the experiments of the mid-1860s by Pasteur and Lister, hardly anyone took germ theory seriously; even afterwards, many medical practitioners were unconvinced. Bostridge points out that in the early 1880s Nightingale wrote an article for a textbook in which she advocated strict precautions designed, she said, to kill germs. Nightingale&#x27;s work served as an inspiration for nurses in the American Civil War. The Union government approached her for advice in organising field medicine. Her ideas inspired the volunteer body of the United States Sanitary Commission.

Nightingale advocated autonomous nursing leadership, and that her new style of matrons had full control and discipline over their nursing staff. The infamous &quot;Guy&#x27;s Hospital dispute&quot; in 1879–1880 between matron Margaret Burt and hospital medical staff highlighted how doctors sometimes felt that their authority was being challenged by these new style Nightingale matrons. This was not an isolated episode and other matrons experienced similar issues, such as Eva Luckes.

In the 1870s, Nightingale mentored Linda Richards, &quot;America&#x27;s first trained nurse&quot;, and enabled her to return to the United States with adequate training and knowledge to establish high-quality nursing schools. Richards went on to become a nursing pioneer in the US and Japan. In 1873, Elizabeth Christophers Hobson co-founded the Bellevue Training School for Nurses in New York, setting the trend for nursing training practices in the US according to the Nightingale plan.

By 1882, several Nightingale nurses had become matrons at several leading hospitals, including, in London (St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Westminster Hospital, St Marylebone Workhouse Infirmary and the Hospital for Incurables at Putney) and throughout Britain (Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley; Edinburgh Royal Infirmary; Cumberland Infirmary and Liverpool Royal Infirmary), as well as at Sydney Hospital in New South Wales, Australia.

In 1883, Nightingale became the first recipient of the Royal Red Cross. In 1904, she was appointed a Lady of Grace of the Order of St John (LGStJ). In 1907, she became the first woman to be awarded the Order of Merit. In the following year she was given the Honorary Freedom of the City of London. Her birthday is now celebrated as International May 12th Awareness Day.

From 1857 onwards, Nightingale was intermittently bedridden and suffered from depression. A recent biography cites brucellosis and associated spondylitis as the cause. Most authorities today accept that Nightingale suffered from a particularly extreme form of brucellosis, the effects of which only began to lift in the early 1880s. Despite her symptoms, she remained phenomenally productive in social reform. During her bedridden years, she also did pioneering work in the field of hospital planning, and her work propagated quickly across Britain and the world. From home, she was able to select and purchase flannel via mail order, a then-new method of retail conceived by Welsh entrepreneur Pryce Pryce-Jones, who would use Nightingale&#x27;s name as a customer in his advertising. Nightingale&#x27;s output slowed down considerably in her last decade. She wrote very little during that period due to blindness and declining mental abilities, though she still retained an interest in current affairs.

== Relationships ==
Although much of Nightingale&#x27;s work improved the lot of women everywhere, Nightingale believed that women craved sympathy and were not as capable as men. She criticised early women&#x27;s rights activists for decrying an alleged lack of careers for women at the same time that lucrative medical positions, under the supervision of Nightingale and others, went perpetually unfilled. She preferred the friendship of powerful men, insisting they had done more than women to help her attain her goals, writing: &quot;I have never found one woman who has altered her life by one iota for me or my opinions.&quot; She often referred to herself as, for example, &quot;a man of action&quot; and &quot;a man of business&quot;.

However, she did have several important and long-lasting friendships with women. Later in life, she kept up a prolonged correspondence with Irish nun Mary Clare Moore, with whom she had worked in Crimea. Her most beloved confidante was Mary Clarke, an Englishwoman she met in Paris in 1837 and kept in touch with throughout her life. She was friends with pioneering computer programmer Ada Lovelace, and upon Lovelace&#x27;s death from cancer at 36 in 1852 after several months of pain, Nightingale wrote, &quot;They said she could not possibly have lived so long, were it not for the tremendous vitality of the brain, that would not die&quot;.

Some scholars of Nightingale&#x27;s life believe that she remained chaste for her entire life, perhaps because she felt a religious calling to her career.

== Death ==
Florence Nightingale died peacefully in her sleep in her room at 10 South Street, Mayfair, London, on 13 August 1910, at the age of 90. The offer of burial in Westminster Abbey was declined by her relatives and she is buried in the churchyard of St Margaret&#x27;s Church in East Wellow, Hampshire, near Embley Park with a memorial with just her initials and dates of birth and death. She left a large body of work, including several hundred notes that were previously unpublished. A monument to Nightingale was created in Carrara marble by Francis William Sargant in 1913 and placed in the cloister of the Basilica of Santa Croce, in Florence, Italy.

=== Statistics and sanitary reform ===
Florence Nightingale exhibited a gift for mathematics from an early age and excelled in the subject under the tutelage of her father. Later, Nightingale became a pioneer in the visual presentation of information and statistical graphics. She used methods such as the pie chart, which had first been developed by William Playfair in 1801. While common now, it was at the time a relatively novel method of presenting data.

Indeed, Nightingale is described as &quot;a true pioneer in the graphical representation of statistics&quot; and is especially well known for her usage of a polar area diagram, or occasionally the &quot;Nightingale rose diagram&quot;, equivalent to a modern circular histogram, to illustrate seasonal sources of patient mortality in the military field hospital she managed. While frequently credited as the creator of the polar area diagram, it is known to have been used by André-Michel Guerry in 1829 and Léon Louis Lalanne by 1830. Nightingale called a compilation of such diagrams a &quot;coxcomb&quot;, but later that term would frequently be used for the individual diagrams. She made extensive use of coxcombs to present reports on the nature and magnitude of the conditions of medical care in the Crimean War to Members of Parliament and civil servants who would have been unlikely to read or understand traditional statistical reports. In 1859, Nightingale was elected the first female member of the Royal Statistical Society. In 1874 she became an honorary member of the American Statistical Association.
Her attention turned to the health of the British Army in India and she demonstrated that bad drainage, contaminated water, overcrowding, and poor ventilation were causing the high death rate. Following the report &quot;The Royal Commission on India&quot; (1858–1863), which included drawings done by her cousin, artist Hilary Bonham Carter, with whom Nightingale had lived, Nightingale concluded that the health of the army and the people of India had to go hand in hand and so campaigned to improve the sanitary conditions of the country as a whole.

Nightingale made a comprehensive statistical study of sanitation in Indian rural life and was the leading figure in the introduction of improved medical care and public health service in India. In 1858 and 1859, she successfully lobbied for the establishment of a Royal Commission into the Indian situation. Two years later, she provided a report to the commission, which completed its own study in 1863. &quot;After 10 years of sanitary reform, in 1873, Nightingale reported that mortality among the soldiers in India had declined from 69 to 18 per 1,000&quot;.

The Royal Sanitary Commission of 1868–1869 presented Nightingale with an opportunity to press for compulsory sanitation in private houses. She lobbied the minister responsible, James Stansfeld, to strengthen the proposed Public Health Bill to require owners of existing properties to pay for connection to mains drainage. The strengthened legislation was enacted in the Public Health Acts of 1874 and 1875. At the same time, she combined with the retired sanitary reformer Edwin Chadwick to persuade Stansfeld to devolve powers to enforce the law to Local Authorities, eliminating central control by medical technocrats. Her Crimean War statistics had convinced her that non-medical approaches were more effective given the state of knowledge at the time. Historians now believe that both drainage and devolved enforcement played a crucial role in increasing average national life expectancy by 20 years between 1871 and the mid-1930s during which time medical science made no impact on the most fatal epidemic diseases.

=== Literature and the women&#x27;s movement ===
Historian of science I. Bernard Cohen argues:

 Lytton Strachey was famous for his book debunking 19th-century heroes, &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot; (1918). Nightingale gets a full chapter, but instead of debunking her, Strachey praised her in a way that raised her national reputation and made her an icon for English feminists of the 1920s and 1930s.

While better known for her contributions in the nursing and mathematical fields, Nightingale is also an important link in the study of English feminism. She wrote some 200 books, pamphlets and articles throughout her life. During 1850 and 1852, she was struggling with her self-definition and the expectations of an upper-class marriage from her family. As she sorted out her thoughts, she wrote &quot;Suggestions for Thought to Searchers after Religious Truth&quot;. This was an 829-page, three-volume work, which Nightingale had printed privately in 1860, but which until recently was never published in its entirety. An effort to correct this was made with a 2008 publication by Wilfrid Laurier University, as volume 11 of a 16 volume project, the &quot;Collected Works of Florence Nightingale&quot;. The best known of these essays, called &quot;Cassandra&quot;, was previously published by Ray Strachey in 1928. Strachey included it in &quot;The Cause&quot;, a history of the women&#x27;s movement. Apparently, the writing served its original purpose of sorting out thoughts; Nightingale left soon after to train at the Institute for deaconesses at Kaiserswerth.

&quot;Cassandra&quot; protests the over-feminisation of women into near helplessness, such as Nightingale saw in her mother&#x27;s and older sister&#x27;s lethargic lifestyle, despite their education. She rejected their life of thoughtless comfort for the world of social service. The work also reflects her fear of her ideas being ineffective, as were Cassandra&#x27;s. Cassandra was a princess of Troy who served as a priestess in the temple of Apollo during the Trojan War. The god gave her the gift of prophecy; when she refused his advances, he cursed her so that her prophetic warnings would go unheeded. Elaine Showalter called Nightingale&#x27;s writing &quot;a major text of English feminism, a link between Wollstonecraft and Woolf&quot;. Nightingale was initially reluctant to join the Women&#x27;s Suffrage Society when asked by John Stuart Mill, but through Josephine Butler was convinced &#x27;that women&#x27;s enfranchisement is absolutely essential to a nation if moral and social progress is to be made&#x27;.

In 1972, the poet Eleanor Ross Taylor wrote &quot;Welcome Eumenides&quot;, a poem written in Nightingale&#x27;s voice and quoting frequently from Nightingale&#x27;s writings. Adrienne Rich wrote that &quot;Eleanor Taylor has brought together the waste of women in society and the waste of men in wars and twisted them inseparably.&quot;

=== Theology ===
Despite being named as a Unitarian in several older sources, Nightingale&#x27;s own rare references to conventional Unitarianism are mildly negative. She remained in the Church of England throughout her life, albeit with unorthodox views. Influenced from an early age by the Wesleyan tradition, Nightingale felt that genuine religion should manifest in active care and love for others. She wrote a work of theology: &quot;Suggestions for Thought&quot;, her own theodicy, which develops her heterodox ideas. Nightingale questioned the goodness of a God who would condemn souls to hell and was a believer in universal reconciliation – the concept that even those who die without being saved will eventually make it to heaven. She would sometimes comfort those in her care with this view. For example, a dying young prostitute being tended by Nightingale was concerned she was going to hell and said to her &quot;Pray God, that you may never be in the despair I am in at this time&quot;. The nurse replied &quot;Oh, my girl, are you not now more merciful than the God you think you are going to? Yet the real God is far more merciful than any human creature ever was or can ever imagine.&quot;

Despite her intense personal devotion to Christ, Nightingale believed for much of her life that the pagan and eastern religions had also contained genuine revelation. She was a strong opponent of discrimination both against Christians of different denominations and against those of non-Christian religions. Nightingale believed religion helped provide people with the fortitude for arduous good work and would ensure the nurses in her care attended religious services. However, she was often critical of organised religion. She disliked the role the 19th century Church of England would sometimes play in worsening the oppression of the poor. Nightingale argued that secular hospitals usually provided better care than their religious counterparts. While she held that the ideal health professional should be inspired by a religious as well as professional motive, she said that in practice many religiously motivated health workers were concerned chiefly in securing their own salvation and that this motivation was inferior to the professional desire to deliver the best possible care.

=== Nursing ===
Nightingale&#x27;s lasting contribution has been her role in founding the modern nursing profession. She set an example of compassion, commitment to patient care and diligent and thoughtful hospital administration. The first official nurses&#x27; training programme, her Nightingale School for Nurses, opened in 1860 and is now called the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery at King&#x27;s College London.
In 1912, the International Committee of the Red Cross instituted the Florence Nightingale Medal, which is awarded every two years to nurses or nursing aides for outstanding service. It is the highest international distinction a nurse can achieve and is awarded to nurses or nursing aides for &quot;exceptional courage and devotion to the wounded, sick or disabled or to civilian victims of a conflict or disaster&quot; or &quot;exemplary services or a creative and pioneering spirit in the areas of public health or nursing education&quot;. Since 1965, International Nurses Day has been celebrated on her birthday (12 May) each year. The President of India honours nursing professionals with the &quot;National Florence Nightingale Award&quot; every year on International Nurses Day. The award, established in 1973, is given in recognition of meritorious services of nursing professionals characterised by devotion, sincerity, dedication and compassion.

The Nightingale Pledge is a modified version of the Hippocratic Oath which nurses in the United States recite at their pinning ceremony at the end of training. Created in 1893 and named after Nightingale as the founder of modern nursing, the pledge is a statement of the ethics and principles of the nursing profession.

The Florence Nightingale Declaration Campaign, established by nursing leaders throughout the world through the Nightingale Initiative for Global Health (NIGH), aims to build a global grassroots movement to achieve two United Nations Resolutions for adoption by the UN General Assembly of 2008. They will declare: The International Year of the Nurse–2010 (the centenary of Nightingale&#x27;s death); The UN Decade for a Healthy World – 2011 to 2020 (the bicentenary of Nightingale&#x27;s birth). NIGH also works to rekindle awareness about the important issues highlighted by Florence Nightingale, such as preventive medicine and holistic health. As of 2016, the Florence Nightingale Declaration has been signed by over 25,000 signatories from 106 countries.

During the Vietnam War, Nightingale inspired many US Army nurses, sparking a renewal of interest in her life and work. Her admirers include Country Joe of Country Joe and the Fish, who has assembled an extensive website in her honour. The Agostino Gemelli Medical School in Rome, the first university-based hospital in Italy and one of its most respected medical centres, honoured Nightingale&#x27;s contribution to the nursing profession by giving the name &quot;Bedside Florence&quot; to a wireless computer system it developed to assist nursing.

=== Hospitals ===
Four hospitals in Istanbul are named after Nightingale: Florence Nightingale Hospital in Şişli (the biggest private hospital in Turkey), Metropolitan Florence Nightingale Hospital in Gayrettepe, European Florence Nightingale Hospital in Mecidiyeköy, and Kızıltoprak Florence Nightingale Hospital in Kadıköy, all belonging to the Turkish Cardiology Foundation.

In 2011, an appeal was made for the former Derbyshire Royal Infirmary hospital in Derby, England to be named after Nightingale. It was suggested the name could be either Nightingale Community Hospital or Florence Nightingale Community Hospital. The area where the hospital is situated is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Nightingale Quarter&quot;.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of temporary NHS Nightingale Hospitals were set up in readiness for an expected rise in the number of patients needing critical care. The first was housed in the ExCeL London and several others followed across England. Celebrations to mark her bicentenary in 2020, were disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic and Nightingale&#x27;s contribution to scientific and statistical analysis of infectious disease and nursing practice may have led to the new temporary hospitals being in her name, in Scotland named the NHS Louisa Jordan after a nurse who followed in Nightingale&#x27;s footsteps in battlefield nursing in World War One.

=== Museums and monuments ===


A statue of Florence Nightingale by the 20th-century war memorialist Arthur George Walker stands in Waterloo Place, Westminster, London, just off The Mall. There are three statues of Nightingale in Derby – one outside the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary (DRI), one in St Peter&#x27;s Street, and one above the Nightingale-Macmillan Continuing Care Unit opposite the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary. A pub named after her stands close to the DRI. The Nightingale-Macmillan continuing care unit is now at the Royal Derby Hospital, formerly known as The City Hospital, Derby.

A stained glass window was commissioned for inclusion in the DRI chapel in the late 1950s. When the chapel was demolished the window was removed and installed in the replacement chapel. At the closure of the DRI, the window was again removed and stored. In October 2010, £6,000 was raised to reposition the window in St Peter&#x27;s Church, Derby. The work features nine panels, of the original ten, depicting scenes of hospital life, Derby townscapes, and Nightingale herself. Some of the work was damaged and the tenth panel was dismantled for the glass to be used in the repair of the remaining panels. All the figures, who are said to be modelled on prominent Derby town figures of the early sixties, surround and praise a central pane of the triumphant Christ. A nurse who posed for the top right panel in 1959 attended the rededication service in October 2010.

The Florence Nightingale Museum at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in London reopened in May 2010 in time for the centenary of Nightingale&#x27;s death. Another museum devoted to her is at her sister&#x27;s family home, Claydon House, now a property of the National Trust.

Upon the centenary of Nightingale&#x27;s death in 2010, and to commemorate her connection with Malvern, the Malvern Museum held a Florence Nightingale exhibit with a school poster competition to promote some events.

In Istanbul, the northernmost tower of the Selimiye Barracks building is now the Florence Nightingale Museum. and in several of its rooms, relics and reproductions related to Florence Nightingale and her nurses are on exhibition.

When Nightingale moved on to the Crimea itself in May 1855, she often travelled on horseback to make hospital inspections. She later transferred to a mule cart and was reported to have escaped serious injury when the cart was toppled in an accident. Following this, she used a solid Russian-built black carriage, with a waterproof hood and curtains. The carriage was returned to England by Alexis Soyer after the war and subsequently given to the Nightingale training school. The carriage was damaged when the hospital was bombed during the Second World War. It was restored and transferred to Claydon House and is now displayed at the Army Medical Services Museum in Mytchett, Surrey, near Aldershot.
A bronze plaque, attached to the plinth of the Crimean Memorial in the Haydarpaşa Cemetery, Istanbul, Turkey and unveiled on Empire Day, 1954, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of her nursing service in that region, bears the inscription: &quot;To Florence Nightingale, whose work near this Cemetery a century ago relieved much human suffering and laid the foundations for the nursing profession.&quot; Other monuments of Nightingale include a statue at Chiba University in Japan, a bust at Tarlac State University in the Philippines, and a bust at Gun Hill Park in Aldershot in the UK. Other nursing schools around the world are named after Nightingale, such as in Anápolis in Brazil.

=== Audio ===
Florence Nightingale&#x27;s voice was saved for posterity in a phonograph recording from 1890 preserved in the British Library Sound Archive. The recording, made in aid of the Light Brigade Relief Fund and available to hear online, says:

When I am no longer even a memory, just a name, I hope my voice may perpetuate the great work of my life. God bless my dear old comrades of Balaclava and bring them safe to shore. Florence Nightingale.

=== Theatre ===
The first theatrical representation of Nightingale was Reginald Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;The Lady with the Lamp&quot;, premiering in London in 1929 with Edith Evans in the title role. It did not portray her as an entirely sympathetic character and draws much characterisation from Lytton Strachey&#x27;s biography of her in &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot;. It was adapted as a film of the same name in 1951. In 2009, a stage musical play representation of Nightingale entitled &quot;The Voyage of the Lass&quot; was produced by the Association of Nursing Service Administrators of the Philippines. In 2019, &quot;Nightingale&quot;, a stage musical produced by Pamela Gerke and directed by Rachel Rene, was performed in Seattle, Washington.

=== Film ===
In 1912, a biographical silent film titled &quot;The Victoria Cross&quot;, starring Julia Swayne Gordon as Nightingale, was released, followed in 1915 by another silent film, &quot;Florence Nightingale&quot;, featuring Elisabeth Risdon. In 1936, Kay Francis played Nightingale in the film titled &quot;The White Angel&quot;. In 1951, &quot;The Lady with a Lamp&quot; starred Anna Neagle.
In 1993, Nest Entertainment released an animated film &quot;Florence Nightingale&quot;, describing her service as a nurse in the Crimean War.

=== Television ===
Portrayals of Nightingale on television, in documentary as in fiction, vary – the BBC&#x27;s 2008 &quot;Florence Nightingale&quot;, featuring Laura Fraser, emphasised her independence and feeling of religious calling, but in Channel 4&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Mary Seacole: The Real Angel of the Crimea&quot;, she is portrayed as narrow-minded and opposed to Seacole&#x27;s efforts.

Other portrayals include:
* Laura Morgan in &quot;Victoria&quot; episode #3.4 &quot;Foreign Bodies&quot; (2018)
* Kate Isitt in the &quot;Magic Grandad&quot; episode &quot;Famous People: Florence Nightingale&quot; (1994)
* Jaclyn Smith in the TV biopic &quot;Florence Nightingale&quot; (1985)
* Emma Thompson in the ITV sketch comedy series &quot;Alfresco&quot; episode #1.2 (1983)
* Jayne Meadows in PBS series &quot;Meeting of Minds&quot; (1978)
* Janet Suzman in the British theatre-style biopic &quot;Miss Nightingale&quot; (1974)
* Julie Harris in &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; episode #14.4 &quot;The Holy Terror&quot; (1965)
* Sarah Churchill in &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; episode #1.6 &quot;Florence Nightingale&quot; (1952)

=== Banknotes and coins ===

Florence Nightingale&#x27;s image appeared on the reverse of £10 banknotes issued by the Bank of England from 1975 until 1994. As well as a standing portrait, she was depicted on the notes in a field hospital, holding her lamp. Nightingale&#x27;s note was in circulation alongside the images of Isaac Newton, William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Michael Faraday, Sir Christopher Wren, the Duke of Wellington and George Stephenson, and prior to 2002, other than the female monarchs, she was the only woman whose image had ever adorned British paper currency.

The centenary of Nightingale&#x27;s death in 2010 was commemorated with a £2 coin issued by the Royal Mint showing her taking a patient&#x27;s pulse.

=== Photographs ===
Nightingale had a principled objection to having photographs taken or her portrait painted. An extremely rare photograph of her, taken at Embley on a visit to her family home in May 1858, was discovered in 2006 and is now at the Florence Nightingale Museum in London. A black-and-white photograph taken in about 1907 by Lizzie Caswall Smith at Nightingale&#x27;s London home in South Street, Mayfair, was auctioned on 19 November 2008 by Dreweatts auction house in Newbury, Berkshire, England, for £5,500.

=== Biographies ===

The first biography of Nightingale was published in England in 1855. In 1911, Edward Tyas Cook was authorised by Nightingale&#x27;s executors to write the official life, published in two volumes in 1913. Nightingale was also the subject of one of Lytton Strachey&#x27;s four mercilessly provocative biographical essays, &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot;. Strachey regarded Nightingale as an intense, driven woman who was both personally intolerable and admirable in her achievements.

Cecil Woodham-Smith, like Strachey, relied heavily on Cook&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; in her 1950 biography, though she did have access to new family material preserved at Claydon. In 2008, Mark Bostridge published a major new life of Nightingale, almost exclusively based on unpublished material from the Verney Collections at Claydon and from archival documents from about 200 archives around the world, some of which had been published by Lynn McDonald in her projected sixteen-volume edition of the &quot;Collected Works of Florence Nightingale&quot; (2001 to date).

=== Other ===

In 2002, Nightingale was ranked number 52 in the BBC&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote. In 2006, the Japanese public ranked Nightingale number 17 in The Top 100 Historical Persons in Japan.

Several churches in the Anglican Communion commemorate Nightingale with a feast day on their liturgical calendars. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America commemorates her as a Renewer of Society with Clara Maass on 13 August. Florence Li Tim-Oi, the first woman ordained priest in the Anglican Communion, in 1944, took Florence as her baptismal name after Florence Nightingale.
Washington National Cathedral celebrates Nightingale&#x27;s accomplishments with a double-lancet stained glass window featuring six scenes from her life, designed by artist Joseph G. Reynolds and installed in 1983.

The US Navy ship the was commissioned in 1942. Beginning in 1968, the US Air Force operated a fleet of 20 C-9A &quot;Nightingale&quot; aeromedical evacuation aircraft, based on the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 platform. The last of these planes was retired from service in 2005.

In 1981, the asteroid 3122 Florence was named after her. A Dutch KLM McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 (registration PH-KCD) was also named in her honour; it served the airline for 20 years, from 1994 to 2014. Nightingale has appeared on international postage stamps, including, the UK, Alderney, Australia, Belgium, Dominica, Hungary (showing the Florence Nightingale medal awarded by the International Red Cross), and Germany.

Florence Nightingale is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 13 August. Celebrations to mark her bicentenary in 2020, were disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, but the NHS Nightingale hospitals were named after her. Nightingale Road () in Hong Kong, between the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and the nursing school, was officially named by the Lands Department after Florence Nightingale in 2008.

<text>Narasimha (, ), is the fourth avatara of the Hindu god Vishnu in the Satya Yuga. He incarnated as a part-lion, part-man and killed Hiranyakashipu, ended religious persecution and calamity on earth, and restored dharma. Narasimha has three eyes, and is in the God of Destruction in Vaishnavism; he who destroys the entire universe at destruction (Pralaya). Hence, he is known as Kala (time), Mahakala (great-time), or Parakala (beyond time) in his names. There exists a matha (monastery) dedicated to him by the name of Parakala Matha at Mysuru in the Sri Vaishnava tradition. Narasimha is the God of Yoga, as Yoga-Narasimha.

Narasimha has a human torso and lower body, with a lion face and claws, with the asura Hiranyakashipu being disemboweled and killed by him in his lap. The asura was the powerful elder brother of the evil powerful Hiranyaksha, who had been previously killed by Vishnu as Varaha, and thus hated the latter. Hiranyakashipu gained a boon from Brahma due to which he could not be killed during the day or night, inside or outside the house; neither in the sky nor on land nor in Svarga nor in Patala, by any weapon or hand, nor by humans, deities, demons, or animals. Endowed with this boon, he began to wreak chaos and havoc, persecuting all the devotees of Vishnu, including his own son Prahlada. Vishnu, cognisant of the asura&#x27;s boon, creatively assumed a mixed form that was neither human nor animal as a lion in the name of Narasimha, and Narashima disemboweled and killed Hiranyakashipu and at evening, which is neither day nor night, at the threshold of his palace, which was neither inside nor outside, upon his lap, which is neither sky nor land, and with his claws, which are neither weapons nor hands. Narasimha is known primarily as the &#x27;Great Protector&#x27; who specifically defends and protects his devotees from evil and destroys evil. The most popular Narasimha myth is the legend of his protection of his devotee Prahlada, and the killing of Prahlada&#x27;s evil father and demon Hiranyakashipu. 

Narasimha is one of the major deities in Vaishnavism, and his legends are revered in Vaikhanasas, Sri Vaishnavism, Sadha Vaishnavism, and various other Vaishnava traditions of Hinduism. He is celebrated in many regional Hindu temples, texts, performance arts, and festivals such as the Hindu festival of colours of the spring, called Holi.

One of the earliest representation of Narasimha, dating back to the 4th-century CE, is from Kondamotu in Coastal Andhra. Other older known artworks of Narasimha have been found at several sites across Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, such as at the Mathura archaeological site. These have been variously dated between the 2nd century CE and the 4th century CE.

==Etymology==

In Sanskrit, the word &quot;Narasimha&quot; consists of two words &quot;nara&quot; which means man, and &quot;simha&quot; which means lion, referring to the man-lion avatara of Vishnu.

His other names are &quot;Agnilochana&quot; () – the one who has fiery eyes, &quot;Bhairavadambara&quot; () – the one who causes terror by roaring, &quot;Karala&quot; () – the one who has a wide mouth and projecting teeth, &quot;Hiranyakashipumardana&quot; () – the one who killed Hiranyakashipu, &quot;Nakhastra&quot; () – the one for whom nails are his weapons, &quot;Simhavadana&quot; () – the one who has a lion face and &quot;Simha&quot; () – the one who is a lion.

==Texts==

===Vedas===
The Vishnu hymn 1.154 of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; (1700-1200 BCE) contains a verse which shows Vishnu as Narasimha as a &quot;wild lion, powerful, prowling, mountain-roaming&quot;, which is Vishnu as Narasimha. Another hymn 8.14 says the story of Indra killing Namuci, that with &quot;water foam you tore off, Indra, the head of Namuci and killed him, killing all demons&quot;.

The full story of Indra killing Namuci is found in &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; (7th - 6th century BCE) of the &quot;Yajurveda&quot; in chapter 12.7.3.v Other references to Narasimha are found in the Vedic texts Vajaseneyi Samhita 10.34, Pancavimsa Brahmana 12.6.8 and Taittiriya Brahmana 1.7.1.6.

====The story of Indra killing Namuci ====
Narasimha has the same story as Indra killing Namuci in the Vedas. Indra is the dharmic King of Heaven of the Devas and Devis who commands lightning, thunder, rain and rivers, while Namuci is a deceptive demon Asura in competition for power. Namuci tells peace to Indra, which Indra accepts. He demands Indra to promise that he will neither try to kill him with his &quot;palm of the hand nor with the fist&quot;, neither in day nor in night, neither with &quot;anything that is dry&quot; nor with &quot;anything that is wet&quot;. Indra agrees.

After the deal is done, Namuci carries away all that nourishes the gods and goddesses: the Soma drink, the essence of food and the strength of Indra. The leader of the gods and goddesses finds himself conflicted and feels bound by his promise. Indra then meets Sarasvati (goddess of knowledge) and the Ashvinas. They reply they will deal with Namuci, get it all back, if Indra agrees to share his powers, the essence of food and the Soma drink with them. Indra agrees. The gods and the goddess then come up with a creative plan. They pour out a foam of water with a thunderbolt, and Indra takes a thunderbolt in his hand and Indra kills Namuci in evening.

After Namuci is killed, the gods and goddesses get all the powers back, but discover that Namuci had drunk the Soma already. The good was thus now mixed with his evil of his blood, which they did not want to drink. So, they extract the good out from the evil. Thus, good returns to the gods and goddesses, the evil is destroyed.

According to Deborah Soifer, this story is the same as the story of Narasimha, it has the same plot, the same &quot;neither-nor&quot; constraints, and the same creative powers of the good kills and destroys the evil. Further, the Sanskrit words and phrasing such as &quot;neither palm nor fist&quot; and &quot;neither day nor night&quot; in the later Hindu texts is the same as in the Vedic texts. This suggests a link and continuity between the Vedic story of Indra killing Namuci and the story of Narasimha killing Hiranyakashipu in the Puranas. According to Walter Ruben, both stories along with several other stories in ancient and medieval texts reflect the Indian Subcontinental tradition of killing and destroying despots and tyrants who abuse power.

===Puranas===
Vishnu as Narasimha is mentioned in a variety of Puranas, in 17 Puranas, Vishnu as Narasimha mentioned. The Valmiki Ramayana (7.24), Harivamsa (41 &amp; 3.41-47), Vishnu Purana (1.16-20), Bhagavata Purana (Canto 7), Agni Purana (4.2-3), Brahmanda Purana (2.5.3-29), Vayu Purana (67.61-66), Brahma Purana (213.44-79), Vishnudharmottara Purana (1.54), Kurma Purana (1.15.18-72), Matsya Purana (161-163), Padma Purana (5.42), Shiva Purana (2.5.43 &amp; 3.10-12), Linga Purana (1.95-96) and Skanda Purana (2.18.60-130) all mention Vishnu as Narasimha. In all these Puranas, Narasimha is described as the God of Destruction, who does destruction at the time of Pralaya and described as Kala. Narasimha is also described as having three eyes just like Shiva and does destruction with fire coming from his third eye.

==Sangam literature ==
The &quot;Paripatal&quot; (Dated between 300 BCE to 300 CE) (, meaning &quot;the paripatal-metre anthology&quot;) is a classical Tamil poetic work and traditionally the fifth of the Eight Anthologies (&quot;Ettutokai&quot;) in Sangam literature. Kamil Zvelebil states that the hymns dedicated to Vishnu and Murugan has branded the Paripatal as a Sanskrit plagiat within the so-called Sangam texts.

The Story of Narasimha in Paripadal
&lt;poem&gt;
O Lord with faultless red eyes! With
burning hatred in his mind and drying up the sandal paste on his chest, Hiranyakashipu, the evil king, fought with his son Prahlada for singing your praises, causing on him great shock. Prahlada was not worried about Hiranyakashipu who deserved disrespect. You placed Prahlada’s away because of your love for him. You attacked and caught Hiranyakashipu with your great strength, catching his mountain-like chest as drums of deities roared like thunder. You disemboweled and killed Hiranyakashipu alive with your claws and wore Hiranyakashipu&#x27;s organs as a garland and threw Hiranyakashipu&#x27;s organs away, along with broken pieces of a pillar which you blasted and came out, as Narasimha.

&quot;Paripadal, poem 4, Verses 10 - 21&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

==History==
===Prahlada legend===
The Bhagavata Purana says that Vishnu, in his previous avatara as Varaha, killed the evil demon Hiranyaksha. The elder brother of Hiranyaksha, demon king Hiranyakashipu, hated Vishnu and wanted revenge. He undertook many years of austere penance to gain special powers. Thereafter, Brahma offered Hiranyakashipu a boon. Hiranyakashipu asked, &quot;Grant me that I not die within any residence or outside any residence, during the daytime or at nighttime, nor in the ground or in the sky. Grant me that my death not be brought about by any weapons or hands, nor by any human or animal. Grant me that I not meet death from any entity, living or nonliving created by you. Grant me, further, that I not be killed by any deity or demon or by any other organisms and divinities.&quot; Brahma granted him the boon, and Hiranyakashipu gained these powers.

Hiranyakashipu, once powerful and invincible with the new boon, began to persecute those who were devotees of Vishnu. Hiranyakashipu had a son, Prahlada, who disagreed and rebelled against his father. Prahlada became a devotee of Vishnu. This angered Hiranyakashipu, who tried to kill the boy but with each attempt, Prahlada was protected by Vishnu&#x27;s mystical power. When asked, Prahlada refused to acknowledge his father as the supreme lord of the universe and said that Vishnu is omnipresent.

Hiranyakashipu pointed to a nearby pillar and asked if &#x27;his Vishnu&#x27; is in it and said to his son Prahlada, &quot;O most unfortunate Prahlada, you have always described a supreme being other than me, a supreme being who is above everything, who is the controller of everyone, and who is all-pervading. But where is He? If He is everywhere, then why is He not present before me in this pillar?&quot; Prahlada then answered, &quot;He was, He is, He will be.&quot;
Hiranyakashipu, unable to control his anger, smashed the pillar with his mace, and following a tumultuous sound, Vishnu, in the form of Narasimha, appeared from it and moved to attack Hiranyakashipu in defense of Prahlada. In order to kill Hiranyakashipu and not upset the boon given by Brahma, the form of Narasimha was chosen. Hiranyakashipu could not be killed by a human, deity, or animal. Narasimha was none of these, as he is a form of Vishnu incarnated as part-human and part-lion. He came upon Hiranyakashipu at twilight (when it is neither day nor night) on the threshold of a courtyard (neither indoors nor out) and put the demon on his thighs (neither earth nor space). Using his sharp fingernails (neither animate nor ) as weapons, he disemboweled and killed Hiranyakashipu alive.

Seeing that Narasimha was in rage, Brahma, Shiva and all of the other Hindu gods and goddesses sent Prahlada to pacify him. Prahlada prayed to Narasimha, and Ugra Narasimha became the peaceful Soumya Narasimha.

The Kurma Purana describes the preceding battle between the Vishnu and demonic forces in which he destroys the powerful weapons of asuras and asuris and kills the asuras and asuris. According to Soifer, it describes how Prahlada&#x27;s brothers and sisters, headed by Anuhrada and thousands of other demons, were all led to the valley of death by the man-lion (who was Vishnu as Narasimha) and killed. The same episode occurs in the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot;, several chapters after Narasimha disemboweled and killed Hiranyakashipu.

=== Vaishnava and Shaiva legends===
In a story of this incident, the Vaishnava and Shaiva scriptures say that the gods Vishnu and Shiva assumed the avataras of Gandaberunda (as Narasimha) and Sharabha respectively to destroy the chaos that happened in the universe. After Narasimha disemboweled and killed Hiranyakashipu, the other deities wrongly thought that the world was going to be threatened by his power. At the behest of the other gods and goddesses, Shiva sent his form of Virabhadra to defeat Narasimha. When Narasimha defeated and drove Virabhadra away, Vishnu and Shiva manifested as Gandaberunda (as Narasimha) and Sharabha respectively. Narasimha (as Gandabherunda) fought with Sharabha for 18 days. On the 18th day, Gandaberunda disemboweled and killed Sarabha, and Gandaberunda (as Narasimha) subsequently took his true form of Vishnu and went to Vaikuntha, while Sharabha took his true form of Shiva and went to Kailasha.

==Iconography==

Narasimha has a lion face with clawed fingers fused with a human body. He is coming out of a pillar signifying that he is everywhere, in everything, in everyone. Some temples such as at Ahobilam, Andhra Pradesh, the iconography is more extensive, and includes nine other icons of Narasimha:
*Prahladavarada Narasimha: Narasimha blessing Prahlada.
*Yogananda Narasimha: Narasimha as serene and peaceful, teaching yoga.
*Guha Narasimha: Narasimha in a pillar of Hiranyakashipu&#x27;s palace to disembowel and kill Hiranyakashipu.
*Ugra Narasimha: Narasimha disemboweling and killing Hiranyakashipu.
*Vira Narasimha: Narasimha killing all asuras and asuris. 
*Lakshmi Narasimha: Vishnu as Narasimha with Lakshmi as Kanakavalli.
*Jvala Narasimha: Narasimha emitting flames of power. 
*Sarvatomukha Narasimha: Narasimha with a powerful face.
*Bhishana Narasimha: A ferocious form of Narasimha.
*Bhadra Narasimha: Blessing form of Narasimha.
*Mrityormrityu Narasimha: Narasimha destroying death of Prahlada by disemboweling and killing Hiranyakashipu.

The earliest known iconography of Narasimha is variously dated to between the 2nd and the 4th-century CE, and these have been found in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. Most images and temples of Narasimha are found in the peninsular region of India, but important ancient and medieval archeological sites containing Narasimha icons are also found as Vaikuntha Chaturmurti in Kashmir and Khajuraho temples, while single face versions are found in Garhwa and Mathura (Uttar Pradesh) and in Ellora Caves (Maharashtra). Other major temples with notable icons of Narasimha are found in Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and the Vijayanagara Empire ruins in Karnataka. Some of the oldest surviving Hindu temples, such as those found in Tigava and Eran (Madhya Pradesh), dated to early 5th-century, include Narasimha along with other avatars of Vishnu. The Thuravoor Temple is the most important shrine to Narasimha in Kerala; the form of Narasimha there is known as &quot;Vatakanappan&quot;.

==Significance==

Narasimha is a significant iconic symbol of creative resistance, hope against odds, victory over persecution, and destruction of evil. He is the destructor of not only external evil, but also one&#x27;s own inner evil of &quot;body, speech, and mind&quot; states Pratapaditya Pal.

In Indian Subcontinental art – sculptures, bronzes and paintings – Vishnu&#x27;s incarnation as Narasimha is one of the most chosen incarnations in Dashavatara of Vishnu and amongst all Dashavatara of Vishnu, Narasimha is popular.

Narasimha is worshipped across Telangana and Andhra Pradesh States in numerous forms. Although, it is common that each of the temples contain depictions of Narasimha in more than one form, Ahobilam contains nine temples of Narasimha dedicated to the nine forms of Narasimha. Statues of Narasimha disemboweling and killing Hiranyakashipu are common, and this image of Narasimha disemboweling and killing Hiranyakashipu is commonly worshipped in temples, and it is drawn.

===Coins, inscriptions and terracotta===
Narasimha is influential in the 5th-century CE, when various Gupta Empire rulers minted coins with his images or sponsored inscriptions that associated the powers of Narasimha with their own. The rulers thus showed their rule as someone like Narasimha who killed and destroyed evil. Some of the coins of the Kushan era show Narasimha, showing his influence.

Some of the oldest Narasimha terracotta artworks have been dated to about the 2nd century CE, such as those discovered in Kaushambi. A nearly complete, exquisitely carved standing Narasimha statue, wearing a &quot;pancha&quot;, with personified attributes near him has been found at the Mathura archeological site and is dated to the 6th century CE.

===Performance arts===
The story of Narasimha disemboweling and killing Hiranyakashipu is a part of various Indian classical dance repertoire. For example, Kathakali theatre has included the story of Narasimha disemboweling and killing Hiranyakashipu in battle, and performances of &quot;Prahlada Charitam&quot; with Narasimha has been one of the popular performances in Kerala. Similarly, the Bhagavata Mela dance-drama performance arts of Tamil Nadu traditionally celebrate the annual Narasimha Jayanti festival by performing the story within regional Narasimha temples.

In Nepal, a dance is performed during mid-November portraying Hiranyakashipu&#x27;s death respecting all criteria of the boon given by Bramaha. This dance is performed mid-night at the heart of mangal bazar, Lalitpur. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v_tzoEyyrc

===Prayers===
A number of prayers have been written in to Narasimha. These include:

* The Narasimha Maha Mantra.
* Narasimha Pranama Mantra.
* Dashavatara Stotra by Jayadeva.
* Kamashikha Ashtakam by Vedanta Desika.
* Naalayira Divya Prabandham Pasuram 2954.
* Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Karavalamba Stotram by Adi Shankara.

==Early images==
In Andhra Pradesh, a panel dating to third-fourth century CE shows a full theriomorphic squatting lion with two extra human arms behind his shoulders holding a conch and a discus. This lion, flanked by five heroes (&quot;Viras&quot;), is Narasimha. Standing cult images of Narasimha from the early Gupta period, survive from temples at Tigowa and Eran. These sculptures are two-armed, long maned, frontal, wearing only a lower garment, and with no demon-figure of Hiranyakashipu. Statues of Narasimha disemboweling and killing Hiranyakasipu survive from slightly later Gupta-period temples: one at Madhia and one from a temple-doorway now set into the Kurma Matha at Nachna, both dated to the late fifth or early sixth century CE.

An image of Narasimha supposedly dating to second-third century CE sculpted at Mathura was acquired by the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1987. It was described by Stella Kramrisch, the former Philadelphia Museum of Art&#x27;s Indian curator, as &quot;perhaps the earliest image of Narasimha as yet known&quot;. This figure depicts a furled brow, fangs, and lolling tongue is same as later images of Narasimha, but the idol&#x27;s robe, simplicity, and stance set it apart. On Narasimha&#x27;s chest under his upper garment appears the suggestion of an amulet, which Stella Kramrisch associated with Vishnu&#x27;s cognizance, the Kaustubha jewel. This upper garment flows over both shoulders; but below Hiranyakasipu, the demon-figure placed horizontally across Narasimha&#x27;s body, a twisted waist-band suggests a separate garment covering the legs. The Hiranyakashipu&#x27;s hair streams behind him, catching his head against Narasimha&#x27;s right knee. He wears a simple single strand of beads. His body is caught and holded down. His face is pushed down. His eyes face away below from the face of Vishnu. Hiranyakashipu is caught and pulled down as Narasimha disembowels and kills him. His organs are disemboweled and fall over his right side. In Matsya Purana it is shown Narasimha disemboweled and killed Hiranyakashipu as a plaiter of straw mats shreds his reeds&quot;. Based on the Gandhara style of robe worn by the idol, Michael Meiste altered the date of the image to fourth century CE.

An image of Narasimha, dating to the 9th century CE, was found on the northern slope of Mount Ijo, at Prambanan, Indonesia. Images of Trivikrama and Varāha avatāras were also found at Prambanan, Indonesia. Vishnu and His avataras have iconographic differences characteristic of the art of central Java. This includes physiognomy of central Java, an exaggerated volume of garment, and some elaboration of the jewelry. This decorative scheme once formulated became, with very little modification, an accepted norm for sculptures throughout the Central Javanese period (circa 730–930 CE). Despite the iconographic peculiarities, the stylistic antecedents of the Java sculptures can be traced back to Indian carvings as the Chalukya and Pallava images of the 6th–7th centuries CE.

<text>Hiranyakashipu (, ), also known as Hiranyakashyap, was a daitya king of the asuras in the Puranas. 

In Hinduism, Hiranyakashipu&#x27;s younger brother, Hiranyaksha, was slain by the Varaha (boar) avatar of Vishnu. Angered by this, Hiranyakashipu decided to gain a boon of invulnerability by performing tapas to propitiate Brahma. After his subjugation of the three worlds, he was slain by the Narasimha (man-lion) avatar of Vishnu.

== Etymology ==
Hiranyakashipu literally translates to &quot;person desiring wealth and material comforts&quot; (&quot;hiranya&quot; &quot;gold&quot; &quot;kashipu&quot; &quot;soft bed&quot;), and is often interpreted as depicting one who is fond of wealth and sensual comforts. In the Puranas, however, it is also stated the name was derived from a golden throne called &#x27;Hiranyakashipu&#x27; the asura sat in or nearby during the atiratra (soma) sacrifice.

==Legend==

=== Birth ===

According to the Bhagavata Purana, Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha are Vishnu&#x27;s gatekeepers Jaya and Vijaya, born on earth as the result of a curse from the Four Kumaras. In the &quot;Satya Yuga&quot;, Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha - together called the &quot;Hiranya&quot;s - were born to Diti (a daughter of Daksha) and sage Kashyapa. It is said that asuras were born to them as a result of their union at the time of dusk, which was said to be an inauspicious time for such a deed.

=== Tapas ===

After Hiranyakashipu&#x27;s younger brother, Hiranyaksha, was slain by the hands of the Varaha avatar of Vishnu, Hiranyakashipu came to hate Vishnu. He decided to kill him by gaining a boon of invulnerability from Brahma.

This initially seemed to work as planned, with Brahma becoming pleased by Hiranyakashipu&#x27;s tapas. Brahma appeared before Hiranyakashipu and offered him a boon of his choice. But when Hiranyakashipu asked for immortality, Brahma refused. Hiranyakashipu then made the following request: 

O my lord, O best of the givers of benediction, if you will kindly grant me the benediction I desire, please let me not meet death from any of the living entities created by you.

Grant me that I not die within any residence or outside any residence, during the daytime or at night, nor on the ground or in the sky. Grant me that my death not be brought by any being created by you, nor by any weapon, nor by any human being or animal.

Grant me that I not meet the death from any entity, living or nonliving. Grant me, further, that I not be killed by any demigod or demon or by any great snake from the lower planets. Since no one can kill you in the battlefield, you have no competitor. Therefore, grant me the benediction that I too may have no rival. Give me sole lordship over all the living entities and presiding deities, and give me all the glories obtained by that position. Furthermore, give me all the mystic powers attained by long austerities and the practice of yoga, for these cannot be lost at any time.
In other Puranas, many variations of the boon are given. The Shiva Purana mentions that Hiranyakashipu asked Brahma that he would be invulnerable to dry or wet weapons, thunderbolts, mountains, trees, and missiles or any form of weapon. The Vayu Purana mentions that Hiranyakashipu asked to be so powerful, only Vishnu would slay him. Other variations include not being slain by any living being, not at daytime or nighttime and not above or below.

In section 14, the Anushasana Parva of the Mahabharata, the sage Upamanyu briefly mentioned to Krishna that Hiranyakashipu also performed tapas to propitiate Shiva. Shiva granted Hiranyakashipu the boon that he would have unrivalled combat prowess, exceeding skill in the use of bow and other weapons, as well as the powers of all the gods, including Indra, Yama, Kubera, Surya, Agni, Vayu, Soma, and Varuna.

In consequence of these two boons, Hiranyakashipu became so mighty that he was able to shake the Himalayas down to their roots. Ravana once tried to lift Hiranyakashipu&#x27;s earrings but he was unable to do so because they were very heavy.

Hiranyakashipu felt invincible and conquered the three worlds, assuming the throne of Indra. According to the Skanda Purana, Hiranyakashipu ruled the universe for 107.28 million years.

=== Death ===
While Hiranyakashipu was performing tapas to be granted these boons, Indra and other devas attacked his home, seizing the opportunity in his absence. At this point, the divine sage Narada intervened to protect Hiranyakashipu&#x27;s wife Kayadhu, whom he described as &#x27;sinless&#x27;. Narada took Kayadhu into his care, and while she was under his guidance, her unborn child (Hiranyakashipu&#x27;s son) Prahlada became influenced by the transcendental instructions of the sage, even in the womb. Later, growing as a child, Prahlada began to reap the harvest of Narada&#x27;s prenatal training and gradually became recognised as a devout follower of Vishnu, much to his father&#x27;s anguish.

Hiranyakashipu eventually became so angry and upset at his son&#x27;s devotion to Vishnu (whom he saw as his mortal enemy) that he decided that he must kill him, but each time he attempted to kill the boy, Prahlada was protected by Vishnu&#x27;s mystical power. When asked, Prahlada refused to acknowledge his father as the supreme lord of the universe, and claimed that Vishnu was all-pervading and omnipresent. To which Hiranyakashipu points to a nearby pillar and asked if &#x27;his Vishnu&#x27; is in it:

 &quot;O most unfortunate Prahlada, you have always described a supreme being other than me, a supreme being who is above everything, who is the controller of everyone, and who is all-pervading. But where is He? If He is everywhere, then why is He not present before me in this pillar?&quot;
Prahlada then answered, &quot;He is in the pillar, just as he is in the slightest dust.&quot; Hiranyakashipu, unable to control his anger, smashed the pillar with his mace. A tumultuous sound was heard, and Vishnu in the form of Narasimha appeared from the broken pillar and moved to attack Hiranyakashipu in defence of Prahlada.

Narasimha had appeared in circumstances that would allow him to slay the asura king. Hiranyakashipu could not be killed by human, deva, or animal, but Narasimha was none of these, as he was an incarnate that was part human and part animal. He attacked Hiranyakashipu at twilight (when it is neither day nor night) on the threshold of a courtyard (neither indoors nor outdoors), and placed the asura on his thighs (neither earth nor in the air). Using his claws (neither living nor non-living things), he disembowelled and killed the asura.

Even after Hiranyakashipu&#x27;s death, none of the gods and the demigods present were able to placate Narasimha&#x27;s fury. So, all the gods and goddesses called his consort, the goddess Lakshmi, but she was also unable to do so. Then, at the request of Brahma, Prahlada was presented before Narasimha, who was finally calmed by the prayers of his devotee.

==Holi==

One of Hiranyakashipu&#x27;s attempts to kill his son Prahlada was to have him sit on a burning pyre with his aunt Holika. Holika had a special boon that prevented her from being harmed by fire. Prahlada chanted Vishnu&#x27;s name and in the battle of good against evil, Holika was burnt down but nothing happened to Prahlada. The survival of Prahlada is celebrated in Hinduism as the festival of Holi.
