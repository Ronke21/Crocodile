<text>Wolof ( ; , ) is a Niger–Congo language spoken by the Wolof people in much of the West African subregion of Senegambia that is split between the countries of Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania. Like the neighbouring languages Serer and Fula, it belongs to the Senegambian branch of the Niger–Congo language family. Unlike most other languages of its family, Wolof is not a tonal language.

Wolof is the most widely spoken language in Senegal, spoken natively by the Wolof people (40% of the population) but also by most other Senegalese as a second language. Wolof dialects vary geographically and between rural and urban areas. The principal dialect of Dakar, for instance, is an urban mixture of Wolof, French, and Arabic.

&quot;Wolof&quot; is the standard spelling and may also refer to the Wolof ethnicity or culture. Variants include the older French , , or , which now typically refers either to the Jolof Empire or to jollof rice, a common West African rice dish. Now-archaic forms include &quot;Volof&quot; and &quot;Olof&quot;.

English is believed to have adopted some Wolof loanwords, such as &quot;banana&quot;, via Spanish or Portuguese, and , used also in Spanish: &#x27;ñam&#x27; as an onomatopoeia for eating or chewing, in several Caribbean English Creoles meaning &quot;to eat&quot; (compare Seychellois Creole , also meaning &quot;to eat&quot;).

==Geographical distribution==
Wolof is spoken by more than 10 million people and about 40 percent (approximately 5 million people) of Senegal&#x27;s population speak Wolof as their native language. Increased mobility, and especially the growth of the capital Dakar, created the need for a common language: today, an additional 40 percent of the population speak Wolof as a second or acquired language. In the whole region from Dakar to Saint-Louis, and also west and southwest of Kaolack, Wolof is spoken by the vast majority of people. Typically when various ethnic groups in Senegal come together in cities and towns, they speak Wolof. It is therefore spoken in almost every regional and departmental capital in Senegal. Nevertheless, the official language of Senegal is French.

In The Gambia, although about 20–25 percent of the population speak Wolof as a first language, it has a disproportionate influence because of its prevalence in Banjul, the Gambian capital, where 75 percent of the population use it as a first language. Furthermore, in Serekunda, The Gambia&#x27;s largest town, although only a tiny minority are ethnic Wolofs, approximately 70 percent of the population speaks or understands Wolof.

In Mauritania, about seven percent of the population (approximately 185,000 people) speak Wolof. Most live near or along the Senegal River that Mauritania shares with Senegal.

==Classification==
Wolof is one of the Senegambian languages, which are characterized by consonant mutation. It is often said to be closely related to the Fula language because of a misreading by Wilson (1989) of the data in Sapir (1971) that have long been used to classify the Atlantic languages.

==Varieties==
Senegalese/Mauritanian Wolof and Gambian Wolof are distinct national standards: they use different orthographies and use different languages (French vs. English) as their source for technical loanwords. However, both the spoken and written languages are mutually intelligible. Lebu Wolof, on the other hand, is incomprehensible to standard Wolof speakers, a distinction that has been obscured because all Lebu speakers are bilingual in standard Wolof.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
The vowels are as follows:
There may be an additional low vowel, or this may be confused with orthographic &quot;à&quot;.

All vowels may be long (written double) or short. is written before a long (prenasalized or geminate) consonant (example &quot;làmbi&quot; &quot;arena&quot;). When &quot;é&quot; and &quot;ó&quot; are written double, the accent mark is often only on the first letter.

Vowels fall into two harmonizing sets according to ATR: &quot;i u é ó ë&quot; are +ATR, &quot;e o a&quot; are the −ATR analogues of &quot;é ó ë&quot;. For example,

There are no −ATR analogs of the high vowels &quot;i u&quot;. They trigger +ATR harmony in suffixes when they occur in the root, but in a suffix, they may be transparent to vowel harmony.

The vowels of some suffixes or enclitics do not harmonize with preceding vowels. In most cases following vowels harmonize with them. That is, they reset the harmony, as if they were a separate word. However, when a suffix/clitic contains a high vowel (+ATR) that occurs after a −ATR root, any further suffixes harmonize with the root. That is, the +ATR suffix/clitic is &quot;transparent&quot; to vowel harmony. An example is the negative &quot;-u-&quot; in,

where harmony would predict &quot;*door-u-më-léén-fë&quot;.
That is, &quot;I or U&quot; behave as if they are their own −ATR analogs.

Authors differ in whether they indicate vowel harmony in writing, as well as whether they write clitics as separate words.

===Consonants===
Consonants in word-initial position are as follows:
All simple nasals, oral stops apart from &quot;q&quot; and glottal, and the sonorants &quot;l r y w&quot; may be geminated (doubled), though geminate &quot;r&quot; only occurs in ideophones. (Geminate consonants are written double.) &quot;Q&quot; is inherently geminate and may occur in an initial position; otherwise, geminate consonants and consonant clusters, including &quot;nt, nc, nk, nq&quot; (), are restricted to word-medial and -final position. In the final place, geminate consonants may be followed by a faint epenthetic schwa vowel.

Of the consonants in the chart above, &quot;p d c k&quot; do not occur in the intermediate or final position, being replaced by &quot;f r s&quot; and zero, though geminate &quot;pp dd cc kk&quot; are common. Phonetic &quot;p c k&quot; do occur finally, but only as allophones of &quot;b j g&quot; due to final devoicing.

Minimal pairs:

: &quot;bët&quot; (&quot;eye&quot;) - &quot;bëtt&quot; (&quot;to find&quot;)
: &quot;boy&quot; (&quot;to catch fire&quot;) - &quot;boyy&quot; (&quot;to be glimmering&quot;)
: &quot;dag&quot; (&quot;a royal servant&quot;) - &quot;dagg&quot; (&quot;to cut&quot;)
: &quot;dëj&quot; (&quot;funeral&quot;) - &quot;dëjj&quot; (&quot;cunt&quot;)
: &quot;fen&quot; (&quot;to (tell a) lie&quot;) - &quot;fenn&quot; (&quot;somewhere, nowhere&quot;)
: &quot;gal&quot; (&quot;white gold&quot;) - &quot;gall&quot; (&quot;to regurgitate&quot;)
: &quot;goŋ&quot; (&quot;baboon&quot;) - &quot;goŋŋ&quot; (a kind of bed) 
: &quot;gëm&quot; (&quot;to believe&quot;) - &quot;gëmm&quot; (&quot;to close one&#x27;s eyes&quot;)
: &quot;Jaw&quot; (a family name) - &quot;jaww&quot; (&quot;heaven&quot;)
: &quot;nëb&quot; (&quot;rotten&quot;) - &quot;nëbb&quot; (&quot;to hide&quot;)
: &quot;woñ&quot; (&quot;thread&quot;) - &quot;woññ&quot; (&quot;to count&quot;)

===Tones===
Unlike most sub-Saharan African languages, Wolof has no tones. Other non-tonal languages of sub-Saharan Africa include Amharic, Swahili and Fula.

==Orthography==

&quot;Note:&quot; Phonetic transcriptions are printed between square brackets [] following the rules of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

The Latin orthography of Wolof in Senegal was set by government decrees between 1971 and 1985. The language institute &quot;Centre de linguistique appliquée de Dakar&quot; (CLAD) is widely acknowledged as an authority when it comes to spelling rules for Wolof. The complete alphabet is A, À, B, C, D, E, É, Ë, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, Ñ, Ŋ, O, Ó, P, Q, R, S, T, U, W, X, Y. The letters H, V, and Z are only used in foreign words.

Wolof is most often written in this orthography, in which phonemes have a clear one-to-one correspondence to graphemes. Table below is the Wolof Latin alphabet and the corresponding phoneme. Highlighted letters are only used for loanwords and are not included in native Wolof words.

The Arabic-based script of Wolof, referred to as Wolofal, was set by the government as well, between 1985 and 1990, although never adopted by a decree, as the effort by the Senegalese ministry of education was to be part of a multi-national standardization effort. This alphabet has been used since pre-colonial times, as the first writing system to be adopted for Wolof, and is still used by many people, mainly Imams and their students in Quranic and Islamic schools.


Additionally, another script exists: Garay, an alphabetic script invented by Assane Faye in 1961, which has been adopted by a small number of Wolof speakers.

The first syllable of words is stressed; long vowels are pronounced with more time but are not automatically stressed, as they are in English.

==Grammar==

===Notable characteristics===

====Pronoun conjugation instead of verbal conjugation====

In Wolof, verbs are unchangeable stems that cannot be conjugated. To express different tenses or aspects of an action, personal pronouns are conjugated – not the verbs. Therefore, the term &quot;temporal pronoun&quot; has become established for this part of speech. It is also referred to as a focus form.

Example: The verb dem means &quot;&quot;to go&quot; and cannot be changed; the temporal pronoun maa ngi means &quot;I/me, here and now&quot;; the temporal pronoun dinaa means &quot;I am soon / I will soon / I will be soon&quot;. With that, the following sentences can be built now: Maa ngi dem. &quot;I am going (here and now).&quot; – Dinaa dem. &quot;I will go (soon).&quot;

====Conjugation with respect to aspect instead of tense====
In Wolof, tenses like present tense, past tense, and future tense are just of secondary importance and play almost no role. Of crucial importance is the aspect of action from the speaker&#x27;s point of view. The most vital distinction is whether an action is perfective (finished) or imperfective (still going on from the speaker&#x27;s point of view), regardless of whether the action itself takes place in the past, present, or future. Other aspects indicate whether an action takes place regularly, whether an action will surely take place and whether an actor wants to emphasize the role of the subject, predicate, or object. As a result, conjugation is done by not tense but aspect. Nevertheless, the term &quot;temporal pronoun&quot; is usual for such conjugated pronouns although &quot;aspect pronoun&quot; might be a better term.

For example, the verb dem means &quot;to go&quot;; the temporal pronoun naa means &quot;I already/definitely&quot;, the temporal pronoun dinaa means &quot;I am soon / I will soon / I will be soon&quot;; the temporal pronoun damay means &quot;I (am) regularly/usually&quot;. The following sentences can be constructed: Dem naa. &quot;I go already / I have already gone.&quot; – Dinaa dem. &quot;I will go soon / I am just going to go.&quot; – Damay dem. &quot;I usually/regularly/normally/am about to go.&quot;

A speaker may express that an action absolutely took place in the past by adding the suffix -(w)oon to the verb (in a sentence, the temporal pronoun is still used in a conjugated form along with the past marker):

Demoon naa Ndakaaru. &quot;I already went to Dakar.&quot;&quot;

====Action verbs versus static verbs and adjectives====
Wolof has two main verb classes: dynamic and stative. Verbs are not inflected; instead pronouns are used to mark person, aspect, tense, and focus.

====Consonant harmony====
====Gender====
Wolof does not mark natural gender as grammatical gender: there is one pronoun encompassing the English &#x27;he&#x27;, &#x27;she&#x27;, and &#x27;it&#x27;. The descriptors bu góor (male / masculine) or bu jigéen (female / feminine) are often added to words like &quot;xarit&quot;, &#x27;friend&#x27;, and &quot;rakk&quot;, &#x27;younger sibling&#x27; to indicate the person&#x27;s sex.

Markers of noun definiteness (usually called &quot;definite articles&quot;) agree with the noun they modify. There are at least ten articles in Wolof, some of them indicating a singular noun, others a plural noun. In Urban Wolof, spoken in large cities like Dakar, the article -bi is often used as a generic article when the actual article is not known.

Any loan noun from French or English uses -bi: butik-bi, xarit-bi &quot;the boutique, the friend.&quot;

Most Arabic or religious terms use -Ji: Jumma-Ji, jigéen-ji, &quot;the mosque, the girl.&quot;

Four nouns referring to persons use &quot;-ki/-ñi: nit-ki, nit-ñi&quot;, &quot;the person, the people&quot;

Plural nouns use &quot;-yi: jigéen-yi, butik-yi&quot;, &quot;the girls, the boutiques&quot;

Miscellaneous articles: &quot;si, gi, wi, mi, li.&quot;

===Numerals===

====Cardinal numbers====

The Wolof numeral system is based on the numbers 5 (quinary) and 10 (decimal). It is extremely regular in formation, comparable to Chinese. Example: benn &quot;&quot;one&quot;, juróom &quot;five&quot;, juróom-benn &quot;six&quot;&quot; (literally, &quot;five-one&quot;), fukk &quot;&quot;ten&quot;, fukk ak juróom benn &quot;sixteen&quot;&quot; (literally, &quot;ten and five one&quot;), ñent-fukk &quot;forty&quot; (literally, &quot;four-ten&quot;). Alternatively, &quot;thirty&quot; is fanweer, which is roughly the number of days in a lunar month (literally &quot;fan&quot; is day and &quot;weer&quot; is moon.)

====Ordinal numbers====
Ordinal numbers (first, second, third, etc.) are formed by adding the ending –éél (pronounced ayl) to the cardinal number.

For example, two is ñaar and second is ñaaréél

The one exception to this system is &quot;first&quot;, which is bu njëk (or the adapted French word &quot;premier&quot;: përëmye)

===Personal pronouns===
===Temporal pronouns===

====Conjugation of the temporal pronouns====
In urban Wolof, it is common to use the forms of the 3rd person plural also for the 1st person plural.

It is also important to note that the verb follows specific temporal pronouns and precedes others.

== Examples ==

=== Sample phrases ===
== Literature ==
The New Testament was translated into Wolof and published in 1987, second edition 2004, and in 2008 with some minor typographical corrections.

Boubacar Boris Diop published his novel &quot;Doomi Golo&quot; in Wolof in 2002.

The 1994 song &quot;7 Seconds&quot; by Youssou N&#x27;Dour and Neneh Cherry is partially sung in Wolof.

=== Oral literature ===

In his 1865 collection of West African proverbs, &quot;Wit and Wisdom from West Africa&quot;, Richard Francis Burton included a selection of over 200 Wolof proverbs in both Wolof and English translation drawn from Jean Dard&#x27;s &quot;Grammaire Wolofe&quot; of 1826. Here are some of those proverbs:
*&quot;Jalele sainou ane na ainou guissetil dara, tey mague dieki thy soufe guissa yope.&quot; &quot;The child looks everywhere and often sees nought, but the old man, sitting on the ground, sees everything.&quot; (#2)
*&quot;Poudhie ou naigue de na jaija ah taw, tey sailo yagoul.&quot; &quot;The roof fights with the rain, but he who is sheltered ignores it.&quot; (#8)
*&quot;Sopa bour ayoul, wandy bour bou la sopa a ko guenne.&quot; &quot;To love the king is not bad, but a king who loves you is better.&quot; (#16)
*&quot;Lou mpithie nana, nanetil nane ou gneye.&quot; &quot;The bird can drink much, but the elephant drinks more.&quot; (#68)

In the appendix to his &quot;Folktales from the Gambia&quot;, Emil Magel, a professor of African literature and of Swahili, included the Wolof text of the story of &quot;The Donkeys of Jolof,&quot; &quot;Fari Mbam Ci Rew i Jolof&quot; accompanied by an English translation.

In his &quot;Grammaire de la Langue Woloffe&quot; published in 1858, David Boilat, a Senegalese writer and missionary, included a selection of Wolof proverbs, riddles and folktales accompanied by French translations.

&quot;Du Tieddo au Talibé&quot; by Lilyan Kesteloot and Bassirou Dieng, published in 1989, is a collection of traditional tales in Wolof with French translations. The stories come from the Wolof monarchies that ruled Senegal from the 13th to the beginning of the 20th century.

<text>The London Borough of Sutton () is an Outer London borough in London, England. It covers an area of and is the 80th largest local authority in England by population. It borders the London Borough of Croydon to the east, the London Borough of Merton to the north and the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames to the north-west; it also borders the Surrey boroughs of Epsom and Ewell to the west and Reigate and Banstead to the south. The local authority is Sutton London Borough Council. Its principal town is Sutton.

The borough has some of the schools with the best results in the country. A Trust for London and New Policy Institute report noted that Sutton had the highest rate in London of pupils achieving 5 A* – C GCSEs. In December 2014 Sutton was described by a senior Government official as the most &quot;normal place in Britain&quot;. In connection with this, the leader of Sutton Council described the borough as &quot;quietly brilliant&quot;, and noted that 91% of residents say it is &quot;a great place to live&quot;.

Low levels of recorded crime are a feature of the borough, being among the lowest in London. An Ipsos MORI poll in 2014 found that 97% of residents felt safe in the borough during the day, and 71% felt safe at night, a higher figure than in 2011.

The 2014 Family Hotspots Report, on the best places in England and Wales for families to live, placed three areas within the borough among the top 10 places in London. The areas were identified as postcodes SM1, SM2 (Sutton town) and SM3 (Cheam). A Rightmove study in 2015 found that Sutton was the fourth happiest borough in which to live out of 33 in London. It achieved the same placing in the 2016 survey.

In 2014, a survey by eMoov (Property Hot Spot Index) found Sutton to be the easiest place in the country in which to sell a property. It was shown in a national detailed Land Use Survey by the Office for National Statistics in 2005 that the London Borough of Sutton had the highest proportion of land taken up by gardens, 35.1%, of any district in England.

The London Borough of Sutton was one of the four &quot;vanguard areas&quot; selected in 2010 for the Big Society initiative.

==History==
The area of the modern borough broadly corresponds to the five ancient parishes of Beddington, Carshalton, Cheam, Sutton and Wallington, all of which were historically in the county of Surrey.

The parish of Sutton was made a local government district in 1882. The neighbouring parish of Carshalton was made a local government district the following year. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. Another urban district was created in 1915 covering the two parishes of Beddington and Wallington.

The Sutton Urban District was enlarged in 1928 to take in the neighbouring parish of Cheam, at which point the urban district was renamed &#x27;Sutton and Cheam&#x27;. It was then incorporated to become a municipal borough in 1934. Beddington and Wallington Urban District became a municipal borough in 1937.

The modern London Borough of Sutton was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, covering the combined area of the former Municipal Borough of Sutton and Cheam, Carshalton Urban District and Municipal Borough of Beddington and Wallington. The area was transferred from Surrey to Greater London to become one of the 32 London Boroughs.

==Districts==

Sutton includes the areas:

* Bandon Hill
* Beddington

==Surrounding area==
== Governance ==
The local authority is Sutton Council, based at the Civic Offices on St Nicholas Way in Sutton.

===Greater London representation===
Since 2000, for elections to the London Assembly, the borough forms part of the Croydon and Sutton constituency. The seat has only returned assembly members from the Conservative Party and the current member is Neil Garratt.

===UK Parliament===
Sutton is divided into two parliamentary constituencies, Sutton and Cheam and Carshalton and Wallington with one member of Parliament each:

==Culture and leisure==

The London Borough of Sutton was once made up of rural villages, associated with feudal and royal estates. The &quot;village feel&quot; persists, and Carshalton, Cheam and Belmont in Sutton continue to be referred to as villages. The historic development of the borough is reflected in the number of heritage areas designated as conservation areas and as areas of special local character. Descriptions of a selection of the borough&#x27;s cultural institutions and attractions are set out below.

===The Sound Lounge===

The Sound Lounge, a grassroots concert venue, opened in December 2020 in Sutton High Street in the former premises of Royal Bank of Scotland. It hosts live performances of blues, Americana, folk and roots music. The venue includes a plant-based, carbon-neutral café, and hosts visual art exhibitions, theatre and dance. The site also incorporates a vinyl record shop (one of two branches of the &quot;Union Music Store&quot;).

In July 2021 the venue became the country&#x27;s first grassroots music venue to be certified as carbon neutral. A wide variety of measures have been put in place to achieve neutrality. In addition to the fully plant-based menu for the café, these include getting all energy from renewable sources, not sending any waste to landfill and maintaining an allotment garden on site for zero-carbon produce for the café.

===The Charles Cryer Theatre, Carshalton===
The Charles Cryer Studio Theatre is situated on the High Street (number 39) in Carshalton Village.
 It was opened by Prince Edward in 1991.
 As well as drama and musicals, productions included comedy and dance. With material ranging from Shakespeare to Chekov to panto and children&#x27;s favourites, the theatre&#x27;s aim was to balance popularity with quality. The theatre also served as a concert venue for local bands and played host to the popular local Rockshot festival. The theatre is named after the man who led the campaign to open the Secombe Theatre, Sutton, listed below. In August 2016 Sutton Theatres Trust, which owned the theatre, went into administration and it closed. However, at a meeting in October 2018, the local council confirmed that the theatre would be brought back into use, following a successful bid to run the venue (on a 25-year lease) by Cryer Arts Ltd. The company plans a range of events, including music, film and theatre.

===The Secombe Theatre, Sutton town centre===
The Secombe Theatre (named after Sir Harry Secombe) was in Cheam Road, adjacent to the Holiday Inn Hotel. The theatre was opened by Sir Harry, who lived in Sutton for over 30 years of his life.
 The theatre was created out of a former Christian Scientist church building originally dating from 1937. The main auditorium seats 396 (or 343 if the orchestra pit is in use), and there is a large multi-purpose function room attached. The Secombe Theatre is operated in conjunction with the Charles Cryer Studio Theatre, named after the man who led the campaign to open the Secombe Theatre. (The Charles Cryer Theatre is in a converted hall in nearby Carshalton – see entry above). Productions at the Secombe have ranged in content from modern productions to new twists on older, more established plays. Some productions have been produced locally, while others have come as part of touring groups. From time to time comedians and musicians have appeared at the theatre.

In 2014, because of local council budget cuts, the venue was, along with its sister theatre, the Charles Cryer Theatre in Carshalton, identified by the Theatre Trust as one of 33 theatres in the country for inclusion on its &quot;At Risk&quot; register. The risk of closure spurred celebrity intervention in favour of the two theatres: writer, actor, comedian and BBC presenter Tim Vine, called on Sutton Council to reconsider its proposals. On 10 November 2014 the local council announced that four organisations submitting outline bids to take over the two theatres had been invited to submit full business cases by 12 December. The council worked with the Theatres Trust and Sutton Centre for Voluntary Services to help bidders through the bidding process. On 15 January 2015 the bid by the new &quot;Sutton Theatres Trust&quot; (STT) was given approval by the council&#x27;s environment and neighbourhood committee to take over the theatres, thus saving them from closure. In August 2016 the Trust went into administration and the theatre closed permanently.

===Carew Manor, Beddington===

Beddington Park is the location of Carew Manor which was the home of the Beddington branch of the Carew family. The Grade I listed great hall, with its hammerbeam roof, survives from the Tudor house along with part of the early 18th-century orangery built around the orange trees planted by Sir Francis Carew in the 16th century and claimed to be the first in England. In the grounds is an early 18th-century Grade II* listed dovecote. Archaeologists discovered a Tudor garden including a grotto at Carew Manor, believed to have been created by Sir Francis Carew in the 16th century. There are tours of the great hall organised by the London Borough of Sutton Museum &amp; Heritage Service.

===Church of St Mary the Virgin, Beddington, Sutton===

The Grade II* listed 14th-century flint parish church of St Mary&#x27;s occupies a prominent position in Beddington Park, immediately south of what is now Carew Manor School and which was from the late Middle Ages the seat of the Carew family. It contains an organ screen by William Morris. The church is designated at Grade II for the following principal reasons:
* It has substantial amounts of fabric from the 14th and 15th centuries 
* It was extensively restored and provided with an extremely elaborate and interesting mid-Victorian decorative scheme.
* It has monuments and other fixtures of importance from c. 1200 to the 20th century, including font and Carew tombs.
* The Morris and Co. organ is of special note, and the Last Judgment reredos is unusual.

===River Wandle===
The River Wandle is a long river which flows through four southwest London boroughs, including Sutton. It passes through Croydon, Sutton, Merton, and Wandsworth where it joins the River Thames. The river changed from being a mainly rural one lined with a scattering of watermills at the beginning of the 19th century to a heavily built-up one by the 1930s. In the second half of the 20th century the river changed again, as the local authorities made improvements to its visual appearance and restored it as a habitat for wildlife. Much of the River is accessible using the Wandle Trail, which passes through Sutton borough at Beddington, Hackbridge and Carshalton (including Grove Park in Carshalton Village).

===Little Holland House, Carshalton===
Little Holland House in Carshalton Beeches was the home of the artist Frank Dickinson (1874–1961). Dickinson&#x27;s Arts and Crafts style interior was influenced by John Ruskin and textile designer and artist William Morris. The house contains many of his art works. Admission is free and the house is open 1.30–5.30pm the first Sunday of each month plus Bank Holiday Sundays and Mondays.

===Sutton Library, Sutton town centre===
Sutton Library is situated close to the top of the town, near St Nicholas Church and the Holiday Inn Hotel, and is part of a complex which contains the Civic Offices, home of Sutton Borough Council, and the Sutton College of Liberal Arts. It is the largest library in the borough. Originally opened in 1975, it was extensively refurbished in 2004 to meet changing customer needs. It was the first public library to appoint a library writer-in-residence; the first to establish a CD and video lending library; and the first to offer a full public library service on Sundays.
The library is arranged over four storeys, and the lending and reference facilities extend to a reader&#x27;s lounge; café and shop; IT facilities; opportunities to listen to music; and a children&#x27;s library themed around the world&#x27;s environments.

===Sutton Life Centre, Sutton===
The Sutton Life Centre is an £8 million community facility designed to improve life chances for younger people and encourage good citizenship. Its key feature – the lifezone – is a virtual street, a room with screens on all walls showing real-life scenes from Sutton&#x27;s streets. It also has a library, a café, a climbing wall, and community, eco, sports, youth and media zones. It tries to encourage community engagement and involvement. It was opened on 27 October 2010 by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

===Honeywood Museum, Carshalton===

Honeywood is a large house at the western end of Carshalton Ponds. At its earliest it dates from the 17th century but has been much extended and restored, particularly in the period 1896 to 1903 when a large Edwardian wing was added to the south side. It now houses the London Borough of Sutton&#x27;s main Museum and has a local history collection, including objects that date back to the Bronze Age. The museum has recently been refurbished, reopening in May 2012 with enhanced features. Among others improvements, there are now expanded displays about the river Wandle and its influence on the life of the area, including an interactive map.

===Arts Network Sutton===
Arts Network Sutton &quot;promotes, champions, nurtures and acts as a voice for the arts&quot; in the borough. Taking over from the former Sutton Arts Council, it was put in place in April 2014, and launched by the Mayor of Sutton in June. It co-ordinates the arts locally and works together with
regional and national arts bodies, informs the local arts community about arts initiatives,
seeks out funding for local projects and runs events.

===Public art in Sutton town centre===


There are a number of examples of public art in Sutton town centre, ranging from building-height murals, to sculptures to an armillary. These are all fully described in the article on the town of Sutton itself. Of particular &quot;borough-wide&quot; note is one of the murals, which is in the form of a mosaic measuring in height and approximately) in width, and covering the whole of a three-storey wall in the town square near the Waterstones bookshop. It was made from vitreous ceramic tesserae (small tiles made of glass and clay), and put in place in 1994. It was commissioned to celebrate Sutton&#x27;s heritage, and shows several aspects of the borough&#x27;s heritage and local history in a geometric pattern of nineteen panels. The centre-piece is the depiction of Henry VIII&#x27;s palace at Nonsuch. Other panels depict armorial bearers from the old local families, as well as industrial and architectural heritage.

===Whitehall Gallery, Cheam===

Whitehall is a timber framed and weatherboarded house in the centre of Cheam village. It was originally built in about 1500 as a wattle and daub yeoman farmer&#x27;s house but has been much extended. The external weatherboarded appearance dates from the 18th century. In the garden there is a medieval well which served an earlier building on the site. Now an historic house museum, the building features a period kitchen, and house details from the Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian eras. The museum temporarily closed in 2016 to allow for a £1.6m refurbishment of the building. It reopened in 2018 with improved facilities. Jill Whitehead, chair of the council&#x27;s environment and neighbourhood committee, said: &quot;The redevelopment of the Whitehall Museum is of major significance to the borough as it is one of our oldest and most historic buildings.&quot;

==Listed buildings==
Within the London Borough of Sutton there are 147 Grade II listed buildings, six Grade II* listings, one Grade I listing, 4 &#x27;B&#x27; listings and 6 &#x27;C&#x27; listings.

==Demographics==
The proportion of Black, Asian and ethnic minorities in general living in the borough has almost doubled each decade since 1991: in 2019 Council data put the non white population at 26.8%, and the total White population at 73.2%. White British is the largest ethnic group at 62.6; this is down 10% from the 2011 census. The Filipino community is the largest foreign-born population in Sutton, closely followed by the Sri-Lankan (Tamil) community.

===Ethnicity===


==Big Society==
The London Borough of Sutton was one of the four &quot;vanguard areas&quot; selected in 2010 for the Government&#x27;s Big Society initiative. Sutton was chosen because of its reputation for having a strong sense of community, its active voluntary sector and track record of devolving power to its neighbourhoods.

== Education ==
===Schools===

The London Borough of Sutton has some schools at both primary and secondary levels which perform exceptionally well. Five of the state secondary schools are grammar schools.
* The Borough came top of the England GCSE league tables in 2011 on the key benchmark – the percentage of pupils achieving five good GCSEs (A* to C) including English and Mathematics. The national average for 2011 was 58.2%. The average for Sutton, at 74.7%, was more than 15% above this national average. Only three other local authorities achieved an average above 70%.
* In 2013 Sutton&#x27;s secondary schools bucked the national trend and performed better than in 2012. 83.9% of pupils achieved five A* to C GCSE grades in subjects including Maths and English compared with 75.6% in 2012. Sutton&#x27;s GCSE performance was second across all borough&#x27;s in England (The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea was first).
* Sutton&#x27;s primary schools were described as &#x27;particularly impressive&#x27; by Ofsted in its December 2013 annual schools report 2012–2013. It ranked Sutton&#x27;s primary schools at joint third in the country and joint first in London.
* In July 2016 it was announced that two schools in the borough had been named the best schools in the country in the Times Educational Supplement (TES) 2016 Awards. Stanley Park High School was named the &quot;Best Secondary School&quot; in the country. Limes College was named the best alternative provision school. TES described Stanley Park as having achieved &quot;remarkable outcomes for its student body by focusing on igniting their passion for learning.&quot; The judges were &quot;impressed by the creative, ambitious and supportive culture fostered at Stanley Park&quot;. Limes College was recognised as a place where young people are able to make a fresh start and build for the future, and where staff truly believe that every student can excel.

Schools in the borough were set to receive the fourth largest funding increase in the country in 2015/16.

In May 2014 it was announced that grammar schools in the borough planned to set aside a number of additional places specifically for Sutton borough pupils. Nonsuch High School for Girls and Sutton Grammar School for Boys had already agreed this new policy at the time of the announcement, while the other three grammar schools in the borough were set to follow suit.

===Adult education===
Sutton College of Learning for Adults (SCOLA), originally named Sutton College of Liberal Arts, is a college offering over 1,000 part-time courses at its borough-wide centres. its main centres are in Sutton and Wallington.

== Environment ==
The London Borough of Sutton is home to a number of notable environmental projects, including the following.
;BedZED (Beddington Zero Energy Development)
The acclaimed BedZED (Beddington Zero Energy Development) housing complex is located on London Road, SM6, about 500 yards north of Hackbridge mainline railway station. It uses a number of innovative technologies to enable it to operate with zero energy use. It was designed by the architect Bill Dunster to support a more sustainable lifestyle. The project was led by the Peabody Trust in partnership with Bill Dunster Architects, Ellis &amp; Moore Consulting Engineers, BioRegional, Arup and the cost consultants Gardiner and Theobald.

The 99 homes, and 1,405 square metres of work space were built between 2000 and 2002. It is the UK&#x27;s largest and first carbon-neutral eco-community. The buildings are constructed of materials that store heat during warm conditions and release heat at cooler times, and where possible, they have been built from natural, recycled or reclaimed materials. The first residents moved in (to the Helios Road part of the development) during March 2002.

BedZED receives power from a small-scale combined heat and power plant (CHP). In conventional energy generation, the heat that is produced as a by-product of generating electricity is lost. With CHP technology, this heat can be harnessed and put to use. At BedZED, the heat from the CHP provides hot water, which is distributed around the site via a district heating system of super-insulated pipes. Should residents or workers require a heating boost, each home or office has a domestic hot water tank that doubles as a radiator.

The CHP plant at BedZED is powered by off-cuts from tree surgery waste that would otherwise go to landfill. Wood is a carbon neutral fuel because the CO2 released when the wood is burned is equal to that absorbed by the tree as it grew.

The development has attracted wide interest and acclaim over the past decade since it was built, and, has won numerous awards. Among other examples of recognition, it was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize for architecture in October 2003, and won awards from the London Evening Standard and RIBA in 2002.

;Sutton Ecology Centre
The Sutton Ecology Centre is located in the Carshalton Village part of Sutton borough. The Grounds are a 1.3 hectare Local Nature Reserve and Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation, Grade 1. It is owned by Sutton Council and managed by the Council together with the Friends of Sutton Ecology Centre.

It is an area of mainly open space where visitors can find out about wildlife habitats, alternative energy, recycling, composting, and organic gardening. The centre&#x27;s activities include running educational visits for schools and community groups, as well as events and volunteer days.

The history of the Ecology Centre is that the grounds were until the late eighties known as the &quot;Lodgelands&quot;, named after the old gardens of The Lodge in Carshalton. They were used as a tree nursery until the early 1980s, when they became surplus to requirements. After a prolonged public debate, it was agreed in 1987 to preserve the area as an open space for public use.

;Carshalton Environmental Fair

The Environmental Fair is held in Carshalton Park on August Bank Holiday Monday.
It features over 100 stalls and showcases local sustainability initiatives. It also includes music, performing art, poetry, children&#x27;s activities, campaign groups, local craft, interactive demonstrations, and a farmers&#x27; market. Music is performed from three stages and across the genres from rock to folk. The main stage is a natural open-air amphitheatre. There is food and a bar with real ales. The fair attracts on average around 10,000 people. It is organised by EcoLocal with a team of volunteers.

;Sutton Community Farm
Sutton Community Farm, the only one of its kind in London, is located in the Wallington part of the borough. A non-profit social enterprise, it occupies a 7.5 acre small-holding of a type originally given to ex-servicemen following the First World War.

;Growing the green economy
The London Borough of Sutton has provided funding to grow the green economy by creating a low carbon cluster of green businesses. The project includes the establishment of a &quot;Green Business Network&quot;, the provision of training, and the creation of employment opportunities for assessors, surveyors, designers and installers.

;Straw-bale café
The café in Manor Park, Sutton has a range of environmental features, in particular its straw-bale construction. It was built in 2010 using UK produced straw-bales and natural sustainable materials, a type of construction which means that the building could last for longer than 200 years. It was London&#x27;s first energy-efficient building to use this method of construction.

==Hospitals==

St Helier Hospital and Queen Mary&#x27;s Hospital for Children in the London Borough of Merton and London Borough of Sutton is run by Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust along with Epsom Hospital. It is located next to the large St Helier estate and close to the major intersection known as Rosehill. The hospital offers a full range of hospital services including a 24-hour accident and emergency department. The site is also home to the South West Renal and Transplantation Service and the Queen Mary&#x27;s Hospital for Children, a dedicated children&#x27;s hospital. St Helier Hospital is a major teaching hospital for St George&#x27;s, University of London, and is the second main teaching site for the clinical years of the medicine degrees outside of St George&#x27;s Hospital.

==Transport==
===Rail===
Sutton has rail services to central London stations, including London Victoria, London Bridge and St Pancras International. Sutton borough has access to the London Underground with the Northern line in neighbouring Merton borough reachable by bus. The London Overground network, completed c. 2010, is 5 to 10 minutes away from Sutton at West Croydon station.

The Sutton &amp; Mole Valley Lines railway route south from Sutton links the borough to Sussex and Surrey to the south, and to central London to the north, providing regular, direct services to stations including Clapham Junction, London Victoria, Dorking, Epsom, Horsham, Wimbledon and West Croydon. Also running through Sutton is the Sutton Loop Line which links St Albans and St Pancras International directly with the stations on the loop. The main station for all these services is Sutton railway station to the south of the town. The station is the largest and busiest in Sutton. Passenger rail services through Croydon are provided by Govia Thameslink Railway under the Southern and Thameslink brands.

===Tram===

The Tramlink service runs to the north of the borough and a short part of the line falls within it, including two stops: Therapia Lane and Beddington Lane. Transport for London spent several years developing plans for a Sutton Link, which would connect the service to Sutton town centre; however, in July 2020, it announced that plans had been &#x27;paused&#x27; following financial negotiations with the Government in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Bus===

A sizeable bus infrastructure which is part of the London Buses network operates from a main hub on the Sutton one-way system. Services are operated under contract by London General, London United, Metrobus and Transport UK London Bus. Route SL7 is the longest route in London, operating from Croydon to Heathrow Airport via Kingston.

===Road===
Sutton is linked into the national motorway network via the A217 and M25 orbital motorway at Junction 8. The M25 skirts the south of the borough, linking Sutton with other parts of London and the surrounding counties. The A24 passes through the north western part of the borough, through North Cheam and onto Epsom, Dorking, Horsham, Worthing, Bognor Regis and Chichester. This follows, in part, the course of Stane Street, an old Roman road linking London and Chichester. The A232 links Sutton with other towns in the borough, also the boroughs of Kingston, Croydon and Bromley.

===Air===
Sutton is located about from both Heathrow Airport and Gatwick Airport. Heathrow is served by London Buses route SL7 and Gatwick by the National Express Coaches A3 route, which stops outside Sutton railway station. Luton Airport, about to the north, is connected to Sutton by a direct train. Croydon Airport which was partly in the borough of Sutton served as London&#x27;s main airport in the years prior to World War II but closed in the 1950s.

===Cycling===

Although hilly, Sutton is compact and has few major trunk roads running through it. It is on one of the National Cycle Network routes running around South London. The nearby North Downs to the south, part of which falls within the borough boundary, is an area of outstanding natural beauty popular with both on and off-road cyclists.

===Travel to work===
In March 2011, the main forms of transport that residents used to travel to work were: driving a car or van, 33.1% of all residents aged 16–74; train, 6.6%; bus, minibus or coach, 6.6%; on foot, 5.6%; underground, metro, light rail, tram, 3.9%; work mainly at or from home, 3.1%; passenger in a car or van, 2.0%; cycling 1.5%. Data from the 2011 Census states that the cycle mode share for people cycling to work had fallen from 2.1% since 2001.

==Parks and open spaces==



In total, the London Borough of Sutton has 89 parks and open spaces within it boundaries, representing a total area of .

===Main parks===
Green spaces range from the compact Manor Park in Sutton town centre and Sutton Green just to the north of Sutton town centre, through the medium-sized Grove Park, which forms a notable part of the Carshalton conservation area, to the large and historic Oaks Park in the south of the borough. In the west is the large Nonsuch Park, the majority of which (including the mansion) lies in the neighbouring borough of Epsom and Ewell.

Just to the north of Sutton town centre there is more extensive green space in the form of Sutton Common, which originally (until the beginning of the 19th century) encompassed the aforementioned Sutton Green. Today, a small portion of Sutton Common is given over to a major junior tennis facility. The common extends both to the east and west of Angel Hill.
Slightly further in the opposite direction out of Sutton lie Banstead Common and Banstead Downs—these start a few hundred yards from the southern end of the town, and extend for an additional mile south in the direction of neighbouring Banstead.

Manor Park was created in 1914 on a site in the town centre opposite the police station. Its grounds include the Sutton War Memorial, which was added in 1921. A fountain was added in 1924. In 2010 its new café of straw-bale construction was London&#x27;s first environmentally friendly building to use this building method.

Features of interest in the Victorian Grove Park include a white Portland stone bridge, known as the &quot;Leoni Bridge&quot; where &quot;Lower Pond&quot; meets the park. Upper Mill is recent reconstruction of a watermill that has existed here from Anglo-Saxon times. The cascade is near the footbridge towards the Stone Court corner of the park. The 1.5m fall is now ornamental in design and was reconstructed in the 1960s. Its original purpose was to create a head of water to power Upper Mill.

It was a very prosperous part of the local agriculture. Blue fields could be seen all over Mitcham, Croydon, Wallington, Banstead, Carshalton and Sutton.

<text>Alexei Mikhailovich (, ; – ), also known as Alexis, was Tsar of all Russia from 1645 until his death in 1676.

He was the first tsar to sign laws on his own authority and his council passed the Sobornoye Ulozheniye of 1649, which strengthened the bonds between autocracy and the lower nobility.

In religious matters, he sided closely with Patriarch Nikon during the schism in the Russian Orthodox Church which saw unpopular liturgical reforms.

While finding success in foreign affairs, his reign saw several wars with Iran, Poland (from whom left-bank Ukraine and Smolensk were annexed) and Sweden, as well as internal instabilities such as the Salt Riot in Moscow and the Cossack revolt of Stenka Razin in southern Russia. At the time of his death, Russia spanned almost .

==Early life and reign==

Born in Moscow on , the son of Tsar Michael and Eudoxia Streshneva, the sixteen-year-old Alexis acceded to the throne after his father&#x27;s death on 12 July 1645. In August, the Tsar&#x27;s mother died, and following a pilgrimage to Sergiyev Posad he was crowned on 28 September in the Dormition Cathedral. He was committed to the care of his tutor Boris Morozov, a shrewd boyar open to Western ideas.

Morozov pursued a peaceful foreign policy, securing a truce with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and carefully avoiding complications with the Ottoman Empire. His domestic policy aimed at limiting the privileges of foreign traders and abolishing useless and expensive court offices. On 17 January 1648, Morozov procured the marriage of the tsar with Maria Miloslavskaya, himself marrying her sister Anna, ten days later, both the daughters of Ilya Danilovich Miloslavsky.

Alexis empowered Morozov to conduct reforms in reducing social tensions, however his measure of tripling the tax burden (arrears for the two years preceding 1648 was demanded) saw heightened popular discontent. Morozov was regarded as a corrupt, self-seeking boyar and was accused of sorcery and witchcraft. In May 1648 Muscovites rose against his faction in the Salt Riot, and the young Tsar was compelled to dismiss them and exile Morozov to the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery. Four months later, Morozov secretly returned to Moscow to regain some of his power.

The popular discontent demonstrated by the riot was partially responsible for Alexis&#x27; 1649 issuance of a new legal code, the Sobornoye Ulozhenie.

==Later reign==

=== Military reform ===
In 1648, using the experience of creating regiments of the foreign system during the reign of his father, Alexis began reforming the army.

The main direction of the reform was the mass creation of New Order Regiments: Reiters, Soldiers, Dragoons and Hussars. These regiments formed the backbone of the new army of Tsar Alexis. To fulfill the reform goals, a large number of European military specialists were hired for service. This became possible because of the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, which created a colossal surplus of military professionals in Europe.

===Rebellions===

Throughout his reign, Alexis faced rebellions across Russia. After resolving the 1648 Salt Riot Alexis faced rebellions in 1650 in the cities of Pskov and Great Novgorod. Alexis put down the Novgorod rebellion quickly, but was unable to subdue Pskov, and was forced to promise the city amnesty in return for surrender. The Metropolitan Nikon distinguished himself at Great Novgorod and in 1651 became the Tsar&#x27;s chief minister.

By the 1660s, Alexis&#x27;s wars with Poland and Sweden had put an increasing strain on the Russian economy and public finances. In response, Alexis&#x27;s government had begun minting large numbers of copper coins in 1654 to increase government revenue but this led to a devaluation of the ruble and a severe financial crisis. As a result, angry Moscow residents revolted in the 1662 Copper Riot, which was put down violently.

In 1669, the Cossacks along the Don in southern Russia erupted in rebellion. The rebellion was led by Stenka Razin, a disaffected Don Cossack who had captured the Russian terminus of Astrakhan. From 1670 to 1671, Razin seized multiple towns along the Volga river. The turning point in his campaign was his failed siege of Simbirsk in October 1670. Razin was finally captured on the Don in April 1671, and was drawn and quartered in Moscow.

===War against Safavid Iran===
In 1651, Safavid troops attacked Russian fortifications in the North Caucasus. The main issue involved the expansion of a Russian garrison on the Koy Su river, as well as the construction of several new fortresses, in particular the one built on the Iranian side of the Terek river. The successful Safavid offensive resulted in the destruction of the Russian fortress and its garrison being expelled. In 1653, Alexis, initially thinking about sending the Zaporozhian Cossacks, eventually decided to send an embassy to Persia for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. In August 1653 courtier Prince Ivan Lobanov-Rostov and steward Ivan Komynin traveled from Astrakhan to Isfahan. Shah Abbas II agreed to settle the conflict, stating that the conflict was initiated without his consent.

===Wars against Poland and Sweden===

In 1653, the weakness and disorder of Poland, which had just emerged from the Khmelnytsky Uprising, encouraged Alexis to attempt to annex the old Rus&#x27; lands. On 1 October 1653 a national assembly met at Moscow to sanction the war and find the means of carrying it out, and in April 1654 the army was blessed by Nikon, who had been elected patriarch in 1652.

The campaign of 1654 was an uninterrupted triumph, and scores of towns, including the important fortress of Smolensk, fell into the hands of the Russians. Ukrainian Hetman Bogdan Khmelnitsky appealed to Tsar Alexis for protection from the Poles, and the Treaty of Pereyaslav brought about Russian dominance of the Cossack Hetmanate in left-bank Ukraine.

In the summer of 1655, a sudden invasion by Charles X of Sweden briefly swept the Polish state out of existence, in what became known as the Deluge. The Russians, unopposed, quickly appropriated nearly everything that was not already occupied by the Swedes. When the Poles offered to negotiate, the whole grand duchy of Lithuania was the least of the demands made by Alexis. However, Alexis and the king of Sweden quarrelled over the apportionment of the spoils, and at the end of May 1656, with encouragement by the Habsburg emperor and the other enemies of Sweden, Alexis declared war on Sweden.

Great things were expected by Russia of the Swedish war, but nothing came of it. Dorpat was taken, but countless multitudes of men were lost in vain before Riga. In the meantime, Poland had so far recovered herself as to become a much more dangerous foe than Sweden, and, as it was impossible to wage war with both simultaneously, the tsar resolved to rid himself of the Swedes first. In the Peace of Kardis (2 July 1661), Russia retroceded all her conquests.

The Polish war dragged on for six years longer and was then concluded by the Truce of Andrusovo (11 February 1667), nominally for thirteen years, which proved the most durable of treaties. According to the truce, Polotsk and Polish Livonia were restored to Poland, but the more important cities of Smolensk and Kiev remained in the hands of Russia together with the whole eastern bank of the Dnieper river. This truce was the achievement of Afanasy Ordin-Nashchokin, the first Russian chancellor and diplomat in the modern sense, who after the disgrace of Nikon became the tsar&#x27;s first minister until 1670, when he was superseded by the equally able Artamon Matveyev, whose beneficent influence prevailed to the end of Alexis&#x27;s reign.

===Response to English Civil War===

When Charles I of England was beheaded by the Parliamentarians under Oliver Cromwell in 1649, an outraged Alexis broke off diplomatic relations with England and accepted Royalist refugees in Moscow. He also banned all English merchants from his country (notably members of the Muscovy Company) and provided financial assistance to &quot;the disconsolate widow of that glorious martyr, King Charles I.&quot;

===Schism with the Old Believers===

In 1653, Patriarch Nikon established a series of reforms that aimed to bring the practices of the Russian Orthodox Church into line with its Greek counterpart. Most notably, the church began to mandate the use of three fingers instead of two in making the sign of the cross. This resulted in significant dissent among the church community. Nevertheless, Alexis continued to support Nikon until 1658, when Nikon abandoned his post due to a personal insult, leaving the seat of the patriarch vacant.

In 1666, the tsar convened the Great Moscow Synod, which was attended by Patriarch Macarius III Ibn al-Za&#x27;im and Patriarch Paisius of Alexandria, in order to address the problems caused by Nikon. The synod agreed to formally depose Nikon, and also decided to excommunicate all who opposed the reforms of the church; those opponents broke away from the official Russian Orthodox Church to form the Old Believers movement.

Across Russia, Old Believers were harshly persecuted. One such old believer was Avvakum &quot;the leader of the old Believers&quot;. Avvakum &quot;had his wife and children buried alive in front of him; he himself was just exiled&quot;. 

Several old believers fled to the monastery of Solovki which had revolted in the Solovetsky Monastery uprising. The monastery would be besieged for seven years until 22 January 1676 which was a few days before Alexis&#x27;s death on 8 February 1676.

==Assessment==

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition: 

Alexis&#x27;s letters were first published by Pyotr Bartenev in 1856. They have earned him a place in the history of Russian literature, as assessed by D. S. Mirsky:

A few private letters and an instruction to his falconers is all we have of him. But it is sufficient for Sergey Platonov to proclaim him the most attractive of Russian monarchs. He acquired the moniker &quot;Tishayshy&quot;, which means &quot;most quiet&quot; or &quot;most peaceful&quot;. He received this moniker through the ways he behaved—he would be kind and friendly, but the sounds created from instruments would provoke him. Certain aspects of Russian Orthodoxy, not its most purely spiritual, but its aesthetic and worldly aspects, found in him their most complete expression. The essence of Alexis&#x27;s personality is a certain spiritual Epicureanism, manifested in an optimistic Christian faith, in a profound, but unfanatical, attachment to the traditions and ritual of the Church, in a desire to see everyone round him happy and at peace, and in a highly developed capacity to extract a quiet and mellow enjoyment from all things.

==Personal description==
In 1666, his doctor Samuel Collins described Alexis (then aged 37) as having &quot;a sanguine complexion with light brown hair, his beard uncut. He is tall and fat of a majestical deportment, severe in his anger, bountiful, charitable&quot;.

==Family and children==
Alexis&#x27;s first marriage to Miloslavskaya was harmonious and felicitous. They had thirteen children (five sons and eight daughters) in twenty-one years of marriage, and she died only weeks after her thirteenth childbirth. Four sons survived her (Alexei, Fyodor, Semyon and Ivan), but within six months of her death two of these were dead, including Alexei, the 15-year-old heir to the throne. The couple&#x27;s children were: 
* Dmitri Alexeevich (1648–1649); crown prince; died in infancy
* Yevdokia Alekseevna (1650–1712)
* Marfa Alekseyevna (1652–1707)
* Alexei Alexeevich (1654–1670); crown prince; died unwed aged 15
* Anna Alexeevna (23 January 1655– 8 May 1659); died in infancy

* Ivan V (1666–1696); was co-ruler along with his younger half-brother Peter, father of Empress Anna
* Yevdokia Alexeevna (1669–1669)

Alexis remarried on 1 February 1671 to Natalya Kirillovna Naryshkina (1 September 1651 – 4 February 1694). She had been brought up in the house of Artamon Matveyev, whose wife was the Scottish-descended Mary Hamilton. Their children were: 
* Peter I (1672–1725), later known as &quot;Peter the Great&quot;, Tsar and first Emperor of Russia
* Natalya Alexeevna (1673–1716)
* Fyodora Alexeevna (1674–1678)

<doc id="95360" wikidata="Q32504" url="?curid=95360" title="London Borough of Merton">
<text>The London Borough of Merton () is a London borough in London, England. The borough was formed under the London Government Act 1963 in 1965 by the merger of the Municipal Borough of Mitcham, the Municipal Borough of Wimbledon and the Merton and Morden Urban District, all formerly within Surrey.

The main commercial centres in Merton are Mitcham, Morden and Wimbledon, of which Wimbledon is the largest. Other smaller centres include Raynes Park, Colliers Wood, South Wimbledon and Wimbledon Park. The borough is the host of the Wimbledon tournament, one of tennis&#x27;s Grand Slam competitions.

The borough derives its name from the historic parish of Merton which was centred on the area now known as South Wimbledon. The local authority is Merton London Borough Council, which is based in Morden.

==History==
The area of the modern borough broadly corresponds to the four ancient parishes of Merton, Mitcham, Morden, and Wimbledon, all of which were historically in the county of Surrey.

The parish of Wimbledon was made a local government district in 1866. Such districts were converted into urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. The Wimbledon Urban District was subsequently incorporated to become the municipal borough of Wimbledon in 1905.

Merton was made an urban district in 1907, which was enlarged in 1913 to take in neighbouring Morden, becoming the Merton and Morden Urban District. Mitcham was made an urban district in 1915, which was incorporated to become the municipal borough of Mitcham in 1934.

The modern borough was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, covering the combined area of the former boroughs of Mitcham and Wimbledon and the Merton and Morden Urban District. The area was transferred from Surrey to Greater London to become one of the 32 London Boroughs.

The name Merton for the borough was chosen as a compromise, following a dispute between Wimbledon and Mitcham over the new borough&#x27;s name.

==Media==
Merton Park Studios, opened in 1929, was a British film production studio located at Long Lodge, 269, Kingston Road in Merton Park, South London. In the 1940s, it was owned by Piprodia Entertainment, Nikhanj Films and Film Producers Guild.

Many second-feature films were produced at Merton Park, and for a time it was the base of Radio Luxembourg. Unlike many other studios, it remained open during World War II, producing films for the Ministry of Information. In the late 1940s, the studios produced several children&#x27;s films.

In 1950, Anglo-Amalgamated began making films at Merton Park. From 1957 to 1959, they produced an average of one second-feature a month there. They produced the crime series Scotland Yard (1953 to 1961, 39 half-hour features), The Edgar Wallace Mysteries (1960 to 1965, 47 hour-long features) and The Scales of Justice (1962 to 1967, 13 half-hour features) at Merton Park. The first film in the Carry On series, Carry On Sergeant (1958), was shot there. The last film made at Merton Park, in March 1967, was from The Scales of Justice series, called Payment in Kind. Outside filming often took place locally. The straight part of the Merton Spur dual carriageway at Wimbledon Chase, was often used for police chases!

Merton Park Studios apart, a lot of filming for former ITV police drama &quot;The Bill&quot; took place in Merton, particularly in the districts of Mitcham and Colliers Wood. The set of Sun Hill police station was also located in the Borough. Ray Austin, born at 9, Abbey Road, Merton, on the 5 December 1932, is an English television and film director, television writer, novelist and former stunt performer and actor who worked in both the United Kingdom and the United States. He filmed episodes of &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;The Saint&quot; in and around Merton. He served as director on episodes of some 150 programs between 1968 and 2010.

The main local newspaper in Merton is the &quot;Wimbledon Times&quot; (recently changed name from Wimbledon Guardian). This newspaper was founded in 1977 by a former Conservative councillor on Merton Council, but since then the paper has been sold on and it is now widely published in different editions across South London. The newspaper is available free, though there is a charge if bought from a newsagent. It is published each Friday. There was an earlier local newspaper known as the Wimbledon Borough News.

==Economy==
Notable businesses with their headquarters in Merton including:
* Eidos Interactive, a subsidiary of Square Enix, located in Wimbledon Bridge House in Wimbledon. 
* Lenstore, an online optical retailer, located in Wimbledon Park
* Square Enix Europe: located in Wimbledon Bridge House in Wimbledon.
*Lidl head offices, located in Wimbledon, although they are moving out of Wimbledon heading for Tolworth.

==Education==
London&#x27;s Poverty Profile (a 2017 report by Trust for London and the New Policy Institute) found that 40% of Merton&#x27;s 19-year-olds lack level 3 qualifications. This is the 5th worst figure out of 32 London boroughs.

==Transport==
Merton is served by a wide range of National Rail stations across the borough, as well as the southern tip of London Underground&#x27;s Northern line and the District line on the Wimbledon branch. The borough is also served by several Tramlink stops from Wimbledon, that goes to Croydon, New Addington, Elmers End and Beckenham. It is the only London Borough which has tube, rail and tram services.

In March 2011, the main forms of transport that residents used to travel to work were: driving a car or van, 19.2% of all residents aged 16–74; underground, metro, light rail, tram, 13.0%; train, 13.0%; bus, minibus or coach, 7.5%; on foot, 5.0%; work mainly at or from home, 3.4%; bicycle, 2.4%.

==Demographics and social conditions==

In 2001, the census recorded that 25% of the population of the borough was from an ethnic minority. The highest ethnic populations were recorded in wards in the east of the borough in Mitcham, Eastfields and Pollards Hill. The percentage of population from ethnic minorities is predicted to rise across the borough within the next decade.

A report by Trust for London and the New Policy Institute found that Merton had a poverty rate of 14% in 2020, the 2nd lowest rate in London. It also found that the 2023 level of pay inequality in Merton is lower than in any other borough, except Kingston.

According to the council&#x27;s comparative assessment of wards made in 2004, the most deprived wards within the borough were in the south and east where unemployment rates, educational attainment and the quality of health were worst. The most affluent wards were in the north and west of the borough.

Comparative crime rates appear to be unrelated to the deprivation ranking of wards. The wards containing Mitcham town centre and the St Helier Estate are ranked highest for crime within Merton with the wards containing the commercial shopping centres of Colliers Wood and Wimbledon also featuring high in the ranking.

The constituency area of Wimbledon is an affluent area of London with a high proportion of city workers, while Mitcham and Morden is relatively deprived by comparison, which explains the geographical split of political representation of the borough at both national and local elections.

Merton currently operates a Police Cadet scheme under the Metropolitan Police Service.

The borough gained a football team in 1889 when Wimbledon Old Centrals were founded, and were soon a member of the local football leagues. The club later adopted the title &quot;Wimbledon FC&quot; and moved into a new stadium at Plough Lane in 1912, where it would spend the next 79 years. As the 20th century wore on, the club enjoyed considerable success in non-league football. The club was elected to the Football League in 1977 and enjoyed a great run of success when began in 1983 with the Fourth Division title, and saw them reach the First Division in 1986 – a mere nine years after joining the Football League. They quickly established themselves in the highest division of English football, and as clear underdogs, pulled off a shock win in the 1988 FA Cup Final against Liverpool, England&#x27;s most successful and dominant club side in Europe during that era. They were founder members of the FA Premier League in 1992 and survived at that level until 2000, before relocating to Milton Keynes, some 70 miles away in Buckinghamshire, in a controversial move in 2003, being rebranded as Milton Keynes Dons in 2004. The club had left its Plough Lane stadium in 1991 to ground-share with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park, with numerous plans to build a new stadium in a number of different locations (including back in London and even in Dublin or Cardiff) being considered over the following decade before the club&#x27;s owners chose Milton Keynes as their destination.

However, a new Wimbledon club – AFC Wimbledon – was formed to represent the local area in 2002 by fans of the original club after the move to Milton Keynes was given the go-ahead. The new Wimbledon club&#x27;s progress was rapid, and after just nine years in existence they won promotion to the Football League in 2011. The club gained permission in 2016 it to build a new stadium back on Plough Lane, using the former Greyhound Stadium around a hundred yards from its old stadium site and still within the London Borough of Merton. In 2018 the final agreements were signed off and demolition work started on the site (for both stadium and 600 flats) in April 2018. Building was completed for the 2020–21 season. The first competitive game in front of fans was played on 14 August 2021, a 3–3 draw against Bolton Wanderers.

The borough also has five non-League football clubs: Colliers Wood United F.C. who play at Wibbandune Sports Ground; Raynes Park Vale F.C. who play at Prince George&#x27;s Fields; Tooting &amp; Mitcham United F.C. who play at Imperial Fields, Morden; and Merton Forest F.C. who also play at Prince George&#x27;s Fields and a Celebrity Fundraising Football team – Celeb FC who play all over the UK without charge for small UK charities.

<doc id="95361" wikidata="Q210563" url="?curid=95361" title="London Borough of Wandsworth">
<text>Wandsworth () is a London borough in South West London, England. It forms part of Inner London and has an estimated population of 329,677 inhabitants. Its main communities are Battersea, Balham, Putney, Tooting and Wandsworth Town.

The borough borders the London Borough of Lambeth to the east, the London Borough of Merton and the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames to the south, the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames to the west, and to the north (across the River Thames) three boroughs, namely the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the City of Westminster. The local authority is Wandsworth London Borough Council.

==History==
The area of the modern borough was historically part of the county of Surrey. From 1856 the area was governed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, which was established to provide services across the metropolis of London. In 1889 the Metropolitan Board of Works&#x27; area was made the County of London. From 1856 until 1900 the lower tier of local government within the metropolis comprised various parish vestries and district boards. One such district was the Wandsworth District, containing the six parishes of Battersea, Clapham, Putney, Streatham, Tooting Graveney and Wandsworth. In 1888 Battersea was removed from the district to be governed by its own vestry. In 1900 the lower tier was reorganised into metropolitan boroughs. The parish of Battersea became the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea and the Wandsworth District became the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth.

The modern borough was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963. It covered the former borough of Battersea and the majority of the former borough of Wandsworth, but excluding the Clapham and Streatham areas, which went to Lambeth.

==Geography==
The borough includes the major Clapham Junction railway station, which despite the name is in Battersea not Clapham. There are many new or refurbished buildings along the borough&#x27;s prosperous riverside including the large Chelsea Bridge Wharf. The Peace Pagoda, one of many such international pagodas, is in Battersea Park, a sprawling rectangle often hosting circuses beside the Thames. The London Heliport, London&#x27;s main and busiest heliport, is just beyond Battersea Park, and south of this is New Covent Garden Market. In terms of size, South Thames College, Southside Shopping Centre, Wandsworth and The Exchange Shopping Centre, Putney are among the largest secular structures.

Secular architecturally most highly listed buildings include: Battersea Power Station, the Battersea Arts Centre (formerly town hall), Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability, Wandsworth Town Hall, as well as particularly the interiors of the large Gala Bingo Club, Tooting, the former Granada Theatre, St John&#x27;s Hill, Clapham Junction by Theodore Komisarjevsky, and in terms of ornate mansions a cluster of five large stone and brick buildings mostly converted to diverse public uses in and around Queen Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Roehampton at grade II* or above. In Old Battersea two fine masonry mansions survived The Blitz: Old Battersea House and Downshire House—both hold rare Grade II* status.

==Governance==
The local authority is Wandsworth Council, based at Wandsworth Town Hall.

===Greater London representation===
Since 2000, for elections to the London Assembly, the borough forms part of the Merton and Wandsworth constituency.

===Westminster Parliament===
The borough contains three parliamentary constituencies:

* Battersea
* Putney
* Tooting

=== Cycling and walking ===
Wandsworth London Borough Council and Transport for London (TfL) maintain cycling infrastructure in the Borough.

Cycle Superhighway 7 (CS7) is an unbroken, signposted cycle route running through the southeastern portion of the Borough. The route runs along the A24 and A3 roads, through Tooting, Balham, and Clapham. Northbound the route links the Borough directly to the City of London via Kennington, Elephant and Castle, and Southwark. Southbound, the route runs unbroken to Colliers Wood.

Cycle Superhighway 8 (CS8) is an unbroken, signposted cycle route running through the northern edge of Wandsworth, through Battersea. The route runs east–west along the A3205/Battersea Park Road, but the route leaves the Borough to the north over Chelsea Bridge. The route begins in Wandsworth Town and runs to Millbank, City of Westminster, passing Chelsea and the Tate Britain &quot;en route&quot;.

Although CS8 leaves the Borough to the north, cycling infrastructure is provided along the entire A3205 route between Wandsworth Town and Nine Elms. This means that there is a continuous, signposted cycle route - primarily along designated cycle lanes - from Wandsworth Town and Battersea to Vauxhall, Lambeth, and the South Bank.

Quietway 4 (Q4) runs from Clapham Common to Earlsfield in the Borough, through Wandsworth Common.

The Wandle Trail is a shared-use trail for cyclists and pedestrians between Wandsworth Town and Waddon. The route is signposted and mainly traffic-free. It runs through Earlsfield, Colliers Wood, Morden, Mitcham, and Carshalton along the way.

The Santander Cycles bike-sharing system operates in Putney, Wandsworth Town, and Battersea.

===Travel to work===

In March 2011, the main forms of transport that residents used to travel to work were (of all residents aged 16–74):
* underground, metro, light rail, tram, 20.7% ; 
* train, 10.6%; 
* driving a car or van, 10.6%; 
* bus, minibus or coach, 9.7%; 
* on foot, 5.6%; 
* bicycle, 5.4%; 
* work mainly at or from home, 4.0%.

==Education==

Whitelands College was founded Chelsea in 1842 by the Church of England, and heavily under the influence of John Ruskin. In 1930/1931 the college relocated to West Hill (Wandsworth Borough) and occupied an enormous purpose-built site, with buildings designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. These buildings, now listed, were one of the Borough&#x27;s largest educational sites until 2005 when the college, again moved, this time to a site in Roehampton, where it is now a constituent College of Roehampton University.

The borough&#x27;s schools include Emanuel School, Graveney School, Southfields Academy, Burntwood School, Ashcroft Technology Academy, Ernest Bevin Academy, Ark Bolingbroke Academy, Ark Putney Academy and Chestnut Grove Academy.

==Religion==
The dominant religion of the borough is Christianity, although the area is also home to a number of other religious communities. The community is home to a number of Sikhs, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus.

According to the 2011 Census, approximately 35% of Wandsworth identified as being non-religious, or chose not to state their faith.

The following shows the religious identity of residents residing in Wandsworth according to the 2001, 2011 and the 2021 censuses.

==Places==

===Parks and open spaces===
Wandsworth has responsibility for three Metropolitan Open Spaces:

* Battersea Park
* Wandsworth Common
* Tooting Commons – the historically separate, but adjoining, Tooting Bec Common and Tooting Graveney Common

These three large green spaces together with a range of smaller parks and playgrounds (such as Wandsworth Park) are patrolled by Wandsworth Council&#x27;s own parks police known from 1984 to 2012 as the Wandsworth Parks Police. From April 2012 the Parks Police team of 23 officers was replaced by a smaller Wandsworth Events Police Service (WEPS) working with a team of 12 Metropolitan Police Officers. This system was deemed unsuccessful, and in 2015 the WEPS was rebranded as Wandsworth Parks and Events Police (WPEP) and returned to full staffing levels of 33 police officers and support officers.

Also within the borough&#x27;s boundaries are Putney Heath and part of Putney Lower Common, which are managed as part of Wimbledon Common, and the west side of Clapham Common, which is managed by the London Borough of Lambeth.

===Theatres===
*Battersea Arts Centre
*Theatre503
*Putney Arts Theatre
*Tara Arts Theatre

==Coat of arms==
The armorial bearings retain many of the features of the arms of the former Metropolitan Borough of Battersea and Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth.

The fess, or crossing, of the shield is chequered blue and gold representing the arms of William de Warren, created first Earl of Surrey by William Rufus. Each gold square bears a teardrop representing the tears of the French Huguenots, many of whom settled in Wandsworth from 1685.

The ship at the top may refer to the Wendels, a tribe of sea-raiders from the Continent who supposedly gave their name to the district, for Wendelsworth was an early variation of Wandsworth. The four shields and oars on the ship represent the four parishes of Battersea, Putney, Tooting and Wandsworth.

The dove to the left is taken from the former Battersea coat of arms and the black dragon to the right was taken from the former Wandsworth arms and also refers to London, being similar to the City of London coat of arms.

== Twin and partner towns ==

=== Villers-Plouich,France ===
The Borough is informally twinned with the village of Villers-Plouich, in Northern France. This association dates back to World War I, following the role played by the Wandsworth Battalion in the liberation of Villers-Plouich in 1917, and again, following recapture, in 1918. Writing in the &#x27;Wandsworth Borough News&#x27; in 1920, Robert H Harker, a Lieutenant in the Battalion, described the cemetery in the village as &quot;an inseparable link between our great Borough and that village of Villers-Plouich, near the Somme&quot;.

For his courage and determination during the hostilities, Corporal Edward Foster, of Tooting, was awarded both the Victoria Cross and the Médaille militaire. A green heritage plaque was unveiled at his former home at Tooting in 2017, and in 2018 a memorial in his name was established on the outskirts of Villers-Plouich.

Following the end of the War the village was adopted by the then Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth under the British &#x27;League of Help&#x27; scheme, and funds were donated towards its reconstruction. A deputation from Wandsworth regularly visits to commemorate this connection, most recently in 2018.

=== Schiedam, Netherlands ===
Wandsworth first established a twin town arrangement with Schiedam, in the Netherlands, in 1946. A number of refugees from Schiedam who had lived for a time in Wandsworth during World War II hoped to maintain their connections with the London Borough during peacetime. The twinning was organised within the scope of the Dutch-English Sports Plan. In subsequent years multiple sporting fixtures between teams from the two areas were arranged including football, swimming, gymnastics, korfball (Wandsworth has a korfball club, at Tooting) and cricket (Shiedam is one of the strongholds for cricket in the Netherlands).

For many years the wartime connections were acknowledged during annual Remembrance Day commemorations in the two municipalities, either through an exchange of wreaths or by sending a representative. Within the context of both inter-business exchange and sporting fixtures, visits were also arranged by specific Wandsworth organisations such as Small Electric Motors and the Rediffusion factory, as guests of their counterparts at Schiedam companies such as Wilton Personnel and Pieterman Glass.

In 1970 a large delegation from Wandsworth visited Schiedam for celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the town&#x27;s liberation. Further sporting and cultural exchanges continued through to at least 1977. However, in 1997, an article in the Dutch local press observed that the relationship with Wandsworth had lapsed.

<text>Lambeth () is a London borough in South London, England, which forms part of Inner London. Its name was recorded in 1062 as &quot;Lambehitha&quot; (&quot;landing place for lambs&quot;) and in 1255 as &quot;Lambeth&quot;. The geographical centre of London is at Frazier Street near Lambeth North tube station, though nearby Charing Cross on the other side of the Thames in the City of Westminster is traditionally considered the centre of London.

==History==

The area of the modern borough had historically been part of the county of Surrey, and generally corresponds to the three ancient parishes of Lambeth, Clapham and Streatham.

The parish of Lambeth included the archiepiscopal Lambeth Palace, and formed part of the Hundred of Brixton. It was an elongated north–south parish with of River Thames frontage opposite the cities of London and Westminster. Lambeth became part of the Metropolitan Police District in 1829.

From 1856 the area of the modern borough was governed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, which was established to provide services across the metropolis of London. In 1889 the Metropolitan Board of Works&#x27; area was made the County of London. From 1856 until 1900 the lower tier of local government within the metropolis comprised various parish vestries and district boards; the parish of Lambeth was governed by its vestry, whilst Clapham and Streatham were both included in the Wandsworth District. In 1900 the lower tier was reorganised into metropolitan boroughs. The parish of Lambeth became the Metropolitan Borough of Lambeth, and the old Wandsworth District became the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth.

The modern London borough was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963. It was a merger of the old borough of Lambeth and the Clapham and Streatham areas from the old Wandsworth borough.

When the government was drafting the boundaries for the London boroughs in the early 1960s, it initially suggested that the Metropolitan Borough of Lambeth and the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark be merged into a new borough; the southern and eastern sections of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth (including Clapham, Streatham and Tooting) would form another. South Shields town clerk R.S. Young was commissioned to make final recommendations to the government on the shape of the future London boroughs, and he noted that the Wandsworth council opposed the partition of its borough. However, Wandsworth&#x27;s suggestion to merge Lambeth with the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea was rejected by both councils involved. Young believed that residents of Clapham and Streatham would be more familiar with Brixton than with Wandsworth, and recommended a new borough formed from the Metropolitan Borough of Lambeth and six wards and portions of two others from the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth.

In the 2016 European Union referendum, Lambeth had the highest share of Remain votes in the United Kingdom at 78.62%, second to overseas territory Gibraltar&#x27;s 95.9%.

==Geography==
Lambeth is a long, thin borough, about wide and long. Brixton is its civic centre, and there are other town centres. The largest shopping areas are (in order of size) Streatham, Brixton, Vauxhall, Clapham and West Norwood.

In the northern part of the borough are the central London districts of the South Bank, Vauxhall and Lambeth; in the south are the suburbs of Gipsy Hill, Streatham, West Dulwich and West Norwood. In between are the developed and inner-city districts of Brixton, Brixton Hill, Streatham Hill, Clapham, Clapham Park, Herne Hill, Stockwell, Tulse Hill and Kennington, each at different stages of gentrification with suburban and urban elements. Vauxhall and South Lambeth are central districts in the process of redevelopment with high-density business and residential property. Streatham lies between suburban London and inner-city Brixton, with the suburban and developed areas of Streatham, Streatham Hill and Streatham Vale.

The London Borough of Southwark lies to the east of the Borough of Lambeth. To the west is the London Borough of Wandsworth; to the south-west is the London Borough of Merton; and to the south is the London Borough of Croydon and the London Borough of Bromley.

<text>The European Economic Area (EEA) was established via the &quot;Agreement on the European Economic Area&quot;, an international agreement which enables the extension of the European Union&#x27;s single market to member states of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The EEA links the EU member states and three of the four EFTA states (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) into an internal market governed by the same basic rules. These rules aim to enable free movement of persons, goods, services, and capital within the European single market, including the freedom to choose residence in any country within this area. The EEA was established on 1 January 1994 upon entry into force of the EEA Agreement. The contracting parties are the EU, its member states, and Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. New members of EFTA would not automatically become party to the EEA Agreement, as each EFTA State decides on its own whether it applies to be party to the EEA Agreement or not. According to Article 128 of the EEA Agreement, &quot;any European State becoming a member of the Community shall, and the Swiss Confederation or any European State becoming a member of EFTA may, apply to become a party to this Agreement. It shall address its application to the EEA Council.&quot; EFTA does not envisage political integration. It does not issue legislation, nor does it establish a customs union. Schengen is not a part of the EEA Agreement. However, all of the four EFTA States participate in Schengen and Dublin through bilateral agreements. They all apply the provisions of the relevant Acquis.

The EEA Agreement is a commercial treaty and differs from the EU Treaties in certain key respects. According to Article 1 its purpose is to &quot;promote a continuous and balanced strengthening of trade and economic relation&quot;. The EFTA members do not participate in the Common Agricultural Policy or the Common Fisheries Policy.

The right to free movement of persons between EEA member states and the relevant provisions on safeguard measures are identical to those applying between members of the EU. The right and rules applicable in all EEA member states, including those which are not members of the EU, are specified in Directive 2004/38/EC and in the EEA Agreement.

The EEA Agreement specifies that membership is open to member states either of the EU or of the EFTA. EFTA states that are party to the EEA Agreement participate in the EU&#x27;s internal market without being members of the EU or the European Union Customs Union. They adopt most EU legislation concerning the single market, with notable exclusions including laws regarding the Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy. The EEA&#x27;s &quot;decision-shaping&quot; processes enable EEA EFTA member states to influence and contribute to new EEA policy and legislation from an early stage. Third country goods are excluded for these states on rules of origin.

When entering into force in 1994, the EEA parties were 17 states and two European Communities: the European Community, which was later absorbed into the EU&#x27;s wider framework, and the now defunct European Coal and Steel Community. Membership has grown to 30 states as of 2020: 27 EU member states, as well as three of the four member states of the EFTA (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). One EFTA member, Switzerland, has not joined the EEA, but has a set of bilateral sectoral agreements with the EU which allow it to participate in the internal market.

==Origins==
In the late 1980s, the EFTA member states, led by Sweden, began looking at options to join the then-existing European Economic Community (EEC), the precursor of the European Union (EU). The reasons identified for this are manifold. Many authors cite the economic downturn at the beginning of the 1980s, and the subsequent adoption by the EEC of the &quot;Europe 1992 agenda&quot;, as a primary reason. Arguing from a liberal intergovernmentalist perspective, these authors argue that large multinational corporations in EFTA countries, especially Sweden, pressed for EEC membership under threat of relocating their production abroad. Other authors point to the end of the Cold War, which made joining the EEC less politically controversial for neutral countries.

Meanwhile, Jacques Delors, who was President of the European Commission at the time, did not like the idea of the EEC enlarging with more member states, as he feared that it would impede the ability of the Community to complete internal market reform and establish monetary union. He proposed a European Economic Space (EES) in January 1989, which was later renamed the European Economic Area, as it is known today.

By the time the EEA was established in 1994, however, several developments hampered its credibility. First of all, Switzerland rejected the EEA agreement in a national referendum on 6 December 1992, obstructing full EU-EFTA integration within the EEA. Furthermore, Austria had applied for full EEC membership in 1989, and was followed by Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland between 1991 and 1992 (Norway&#x27;s EU accession was rejected in a referendum, Switzerland froze its EU application after the EEA agreement was rejected in a referendum). The fall of the Iron Curtain had made the EU less hesitant to accept these highly developed countries as member states, since that would relieve the pressure on the EU&#x27;s budget when the former socialist countries of Central Europe were to join.

==Membership==
The EEA Agreement was signed in Porto on 2 May 1992 by the then seven states of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), the European Community (EC) and its then 12 member states. On 6 December 1992, Switzerland&#x27;s voters rejected the ratification of the agreement in a constitutionally mandated referendum, effectively freezing the application for EC membership submitted earlier in the year. Switzerland is instead linked to the EU by a series of bilateral agreements. On 1 January 1995, three erstwhile members of the EFTA—Austria, Finland and Sweden—acceded to the European Union, which had superseded the European Community upon the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty on 1 November 1993. Liechtenstein&#x27;s participation in the EEA was delayed until 1 May 1995. Any European State becoming a member of the EU shall, or becoming a member of EFTA may, apply to become a Party to the EEA agreement according to article 128 of the agreement.

, the contracting parties to the EEA are three of the four EFTA member states and the 27 EU member states.

===Treaties===
Besides the 1992 Treaty, one amending treaty was signed, as well as three treaties to allow for accession of new members of the European Union.

=== Ratification of the EEA Agreement ===

Notes
==Enlargement==
===Recent EU member states===
When a state joins the EU, they do not necessarily simultaneously become part of the EEA. They are obliged to apply separately, and an agreement between EEA member states must be signed and ratified to admit a new member.

Following the 2004 enlargement of the EU, which saw Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia acceding to the EU on 1 May 2004, the EEA Enlargement Agreement was applied on a provisional basis to the 10 acceding countries as from the date of their accession to the EU while their EEA accession agreement was pending ratification by all EEA parties. 

On the other hand, following the 2007 enlargement of the EU, which saw Bulgaria and Romania acceding to the EU on 1 January 2007, an EEA Enlargement Agreement was not signed until 25 July 2007 and only provisionally entered into force on 1 August 2007. The agreement did not fully enter into force until 9 November 2011.

Croatia is the newest EU member state, having joined on 1 July 2013. Croatia applied to join the EEA on 13 September 2012, with the agreement concluded on 20 November 2013. It was signed in April 2014 and provisionally applied until it officially entered into force on 19 February 2025.

===Future EU member states===
There are nine recognised candidates for membership of the European Union: Turkey (since 1999), North Macedonia (2005), Montenegro (2010), Serbia (2012), Albania (2014), Moldova (2022), Ukraine (2022), Bosnia and Herzegovina (2022) and Georgia (2023). Kosovo (whose independence is not recognised by five EU member states) formally submitted its application for membership in 2022 and is considered a potential candidate by the European Union.

===Faroe Islands===
In mid-2005, representatives of the Faroe Islands hinted at the possibility of their territory joining the EFTA. However, the ability of the Faroes to join is uncertain because, according to Article 56 of the EFTA Convention, only states may become members of the Association. The Faroes, which form part of the Danish Realm, is not a sovereign state, and according to a report prepared for the Faroes Ministry of Foreign Affairs &quot;under its constitutional status the Faroes cannot become an independent Contracting Party to the EEA Agreement due to the fact that the Faroes are not a state&quot;. However, the report went on to suggest that it is possible that the &quot;Kingdom of Denmark in respect of the Faroes&quot; could join the EFTA. The Danish Government has stated that the Faroes cannot become an independent member of the EEA as Denmark is already a party to the EEA Agreement. The Faroes already have an extensive bilateral free trade agreement with Iceland, known as the Hoyvík Agreement.

===Switzerland===

A referendum of 1992 rejected this, and there is a prevalent opinion among EU/EEA countries that Swiss referendums would disrupt the EEA-EU cooperation, like has happened with the Switzerland-EU cooperation.

A poll in December 2022 to mark 30 years since the 1992 EEA referendum indicated that 71% would vote for EEA participation if a referendum were held. For common Swiss people, a major difference between EEA and the Swiss agreement, is that EEA includes free movement for services including roaming prices for mobile phones. A members bill about joining EEA in 2022 was mostly rejected by the Federal council (government) considering the present treaties better for Switzerland.

===European microstates===
In November 2012, after the Council of the European Union had called for an evaluation of the EU&#x27;s relations with the sovereign European microstates of Andorra, Monaco and San Marino, which they described as &quot;fragmented&quot;, the European Commission published a report outlining options for their further integration into the EU. Unlike Liechtenstein, which is a member of the EEA via the EFTA and the Schengen Agreement, relations with these three states are based on a collection of agreements covering specific issues. The report examined four alternatives to the current situation: 1) a Sectoral Approach with separate agreements with each state covering an entire policy area, 2) a comprehensive, multilateral Framework Association Agreement (FAA) with the three states, 3) EEA membership, and 4) EU membership. The Commission argued that the sectoral approach did not address the major issues and was still needlessly complicated, while EU membership was dismissed in the near future because &quot;the EU institutions are currently not adapted to the accession of such small-sized countries&quot;. The remaining options, EEA membership and an FAA with the states, were found to be viable and were recommended by the commission.

As EEA membership is currently only open to EFTA or EU members, the consent of existing EFTA member states is required for the microstates to join the EEA without becoming members of the EU. In 2011, Jonas Gahr Støre, the then Foreign Minister of Norway, which is an EFTA member state, said that EFTA/EEA membership for the microstates was not the appropriate mechanism for their integration into the internal market because their requirements differed from those of larger countries such as Norway, and suggested that a simplified association would be better suited for them. Espen Barth Eide, Støre&#x27;s successor, responded to the commission&#x27;s report in late 2012 by questioning whether the microstates have sufficient administrative capabilities to meet the obligations of EEA membership. However, he stated that Norway was open to the possibility of EFTA membership for the microstates if they decide to submit an application, and that the country had not made a final decision on the matter. Pascal Schafhauser, the Counsellor of the Liechtenstein Mission to the EU, said that Liechtenstein, another EFTA member state, was willing to discuss EEA membership for the microstates provided their joining did not impede the functioning of the organisation. However, he suggested that the option of direct membership in the EEA for the microstates, outside both the EFTA and the EU, should be given consideration.

On 18 November 2013, the EU Commission concluded that &quot;the participation of the small-sized countries in the EEA is not judged to be a viable option at present due to the political and institutional reasons&quot;, and that Association Agreements were a more feasible mechanism to integrate the microstates into the internal market.

==Withdrawal of the United Kingdom==

The United Kingdom, in a 2016 referendum, voted to withdraw from the European Union. Staying in the EEA, possibly eventually as an EFTA member, was an option suggested by the then Environment Secretary, Michael Gove.

A 2013 research paper presented to the Parliament of the United Kingdom proposed a number of alternatives to EU membership which would continue to allow it access to the EU&#x27;s internal market, including continued EEA membership as an EFTA member state, or the Swiss model of a number of bilateral treaties covering the provisions of the single market. The United Kingdom was a co-founder of EFTA in 1960, but ceased to be a member upon joining the European Community. In the first meeting since the Brexit vote, EFTA reacted by saying both that it was open to a United Kingdom return and that it had many issues to work through although the Norwegian Government later expressed reservations. In January 2017, Theresa May, then the British prime minister, announced a 12-point plan of negotiating objectives and confirmed that the government of the United Kingdom would not seek continued permanent membership in the single market. The United Kingdom could be allowed by other member states to join the EEA and EFTA but existing EEA members such as Norway would have concerns about taking the risk of opening a difficult negotiation with the EU that could lead them to lose their current advantages. The Scottish Government has looked into membership of the EFTA to retain access to the EEA. However, other EFTA states have stated that only sovereign states are eligible for membership, so it could only join if it became independent from the United Kingdom.

The EEA EFTA States (Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein) signed a &quot;Separation Agreement&quot; with the UK on 28 January 2020, which is understood to mirror the EEA-relevant parts of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement stipulated a transition period, following the UK&#x27;s formal withdrawal on 31 January 2020 and ending 31 December 2020, during which both the United Kingdom and the other EEA members remained bound by the existing obligations stemming from international agreements concluded by the EU, including the EEA Agreement. In January and February 2020, the government of the United Kingdom ruled out a future alignment to the rules of the internal market, effectively ruling out EEA membership after the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020.

==Rights and obligations==
The EEA relies on the same &quot;four freedoms&quot; underpinning the European single market as does the European Union: the free movement of goods, persons, services, and capital among the EEA countries. Thus, the EEA countries that are not part of the EU enjoy free trade with the European Union. Also, the &#x27;free movement of persons is one of the core rights guaranteed in the European Economic Area (EEA) [...]. It is perhaps the most important right for individuals, as it gives citizens of the 30 EEA countries the opportunity to live, work, establish business and study in any of these countries&#x27;.

As a counterpart, these countries have to adopt part of the Law of the European Union.
However they also contribute to and influence the formation of new EEA relevant policies and legislation at an early stage as part of a formal decision-shaping process.

Agriculture and fisheries are not covered by the EEA. Not being bound by the Common Fisheries Policy is perceived as very important by Norway and Iceland, and a major reason not to join the EU. The Common Fisheries Policy would mean giving away fishing quotas in their waters.

The EEA countries that are not part of the EU do not contribute financially to Union objectives to the same extent as do its members, although they contribute to the EEA Grants scheme to &quot;reduce social and economic disparities in the EEA&quot;. Additionally, some choose to take part in EU programmes such as Trans-European Networks and the European Regional Development Fund. Norway also has its own Norway Grants scheme. After the EU/EEA enlargement of 2004, there was a tenfold increase in the financial contribution of the EEA States, in particular Norway, to social and economic cohesion in the Internal Market (€1167 million over five years).

==Legislation==

The non-EU members of the EEA (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) have agreed to enact legislation similar to that passed in the EU in the areas of social policy, consumer protection, environment, company law and statistics. These are some of the areas covered by the former European Community (the &quot;first pillar&quot; of the European Union).

The non-EU members of the EEA are not represented in Institutions of the European Union such as the European Parliament or European Commission. This situation has been described as &quot;fax democracy&quot;, with Norway waiting for their latest legislation to be faxed from the commission. However, EEA countries are consulted about new EU legislative proposals and participate in shaping legislation at an early stage. The EEA Agreement contains provisions for input from the EEA/EFTA countries at various stages before legislation is adopted, including consent at the EEA Joint Committee. Once approved at the EEA Joint Committee, it is part of the EEA Agreement, and the EFTA states within the EEA must implement it in their national law.

==Institutions==
The EEA Joint Committee consists of the EEA-EFTA States plus the European Commission (representing the EU) and has the function of amending the EEA Agreement to include relevant EU legislation. An EEA Council meets twice yearly to govern the overall relationship between the EEA members.

Rather than setting up pan-EEA institutions, the activities of the EEA are regulated by the European Union institutions, as well as the EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court. The EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court regulate the activities of the EFTA members in respect of their obligations in the European Economic Area (EEA). The EFTA Surveillance Authority performs the European Commission&#x27;s role as &quot;guardian of the treaties&quot; for the EFTA countries to ensure the EEA Agreement is being followed. The EFTA Court performs a similar role to the European Court of Justice&#x27;s in that it resolves disputes under the EEA Agreement.

While the ECJ and European Commission are respectively responsible for the interpretation and application of the EEA Agreement in the EU (between EU member states and within EU member states), and the EFTA Court and EFTA Surveillance Authority are likewise respectively responsible for interpreting and monitoring the application of the EEA Agreement among the EEA-EFTA states (between the EEA-EFTA states and within the EEA-EFTA states), disputes &quot;between&quot; an EU state and an EEA-EFTA state are referred to the EEA Joint Committee rather to either court. Only if the Joint Committee cannot provide a resolution within three months, would the disputing parties jointly submit to the ECJ for a ruling (if the dispute concerns provisions identical to EU law) or to arbitration (in all other cases).

The original plan for the EEA lacked the EFTA Court or the EFTA Surveillance Authority, as the &quot;EEA court&quot; (which would be composed of five European Court of Justice members and three members from EFTA countries and which would be functionally integrated with the ECJ) and the European Commission were to exercise those roles. However, during the negotiations for the EEA agreement, the European Court of Justice informed the Council of the European Union (Opinion 1/91) that they considered that giving the EEA court jurisdiction with respect to EU law that would be part of the EEA law, would be a violation of the treaties, and therefore the current arrangement was developed instead. After having negotiated the Surveillance Authority, the ECJ confirmed its legality in Opinion 1/92.

The EFTA Secretariat is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. The EFTA Surveillance Authority has its headquarters in Brussels, Belgium (the same location as the headquarters of the European Commission), while the EFTA Court has its headquarters in Luxembourg (the same location as the headquarters of the European Court of Justice).

==EEA and Norway Grants==
The EEA and Norway Grants are the financial contributions of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway to reduce social and economic disparities in Europe. In the period from 2004 to 2009, €1.3 billion of project funding is made available for project funding in the 15 beneficiary states in Central and Southern Europe.

Established in conjunction with the 2004 enlargement of the European Economic Area (EEA), which brings together the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway in the Internal Market, the EEA and Norway Grants were administered by the Financial Mechanism Office, which is affiliated to the EFTA Secretariat in Brussels.

<text>Xhosa ( , ), formerly spelled Xosa and also known by its local name isiXhosa, is a Bantu language, indigenous to Southern Africa and one of the official languages of South Africa and Zimbabwe. Xhosa is spoken as a first language by approximately 8 million people and as a second language in South Africa, particularly in Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Northern Cape and Gauteng, and also in parts of Zimbabwe and Lesotho. It has perhaps the heaviest functional load of click consonants in a Bantu language (approximately tied with Yeyi), with one count finding that 10% of basic vocabulary items contained a click.

==Classification==
Xhosa is part of the branch of Nguni languages, which also include Zulu, Southern Ndebele and Northern Ndebele, called the Zunda languages. Zunda languages effectively form a dialect continuum of variously mutually intelligible varieties.

Xhosa is, to a large extent, mutually intelligible with Zulu and with other Nguni languages to a lesser extent. Nguni languages are, in turn, classified under the much larger abstraction of Bantu languages.

==Geographical distribution==

Xhosa is the most widely distributed African language in South Africa, though the most commonly spoken South African language is Zulu. Xhosa is the second most common Bantu home language in South Africa. approximately 5.3 million Xhosa-speakers, the majority, live in the Eastern Cape, followed by the Western Cape (approximately 1 million), Gauteng (671,045), the Free State (246,192), KwaZulu-Natal (219,826), North West (214,461), Mpumalanga (46,553), the Northern Cape (51,228), and Limpopo (14,225). There is a small but significant Xhosa community of about 200,000 in Zimbabwe. Also, a small community of Xhosa speakers (18,000) live in Quthing District, Lesotho.

==Orthography==
===Latin script===
The Xhosa language employs 26 letters from the Latin alphabet; some of the letters have different pronunciations from English. Phonemes not represented by one of the 26 letters are written as multiple letters. Tone, stress, and vowel length are parts of the language but are generally not indicated in writing.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
Xhosa has an inventory of ten vowels: , , , and written &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u&quot; in order, all occurring in both long and short. The vowel is long in the penultimate syllable and short in the last syllable.
===Tones===
Xhosa is a tonal language with two inherent phonemic tones: low and high. Tones are rarely marked in the written language, but they can be indicated , , , . Long vowels are phonemic but are usually not written except for and , which are each sequence of two vowels with different tones that are realized as long vowels with contour tones ( high–low = falling, low–high = rising).

===Consonants===
Xhosa is rich in uncommon consonants. Besides pulmonic egressive sounds, which are found in all spoken languages, it has a series of ejective stops and one implosive stop.

It has 18 click consonants (in comparison, Juǀʼhoan, spoken in Botswana and Namibia, has 48, and Taa, with roughly 4,000 speakers in Botswana, has 83). There is a series of six dental clicks, represented by the letter , similar to the sound represented in English by &quot;tut-tut&quot; or &quot;tsk-tsk&quot;; a series of six alveolar lateral clicks, represented by the letter , similar to the sound used to call horses; and a series of alveolar clicks, represented by the letter , articulated by placing the tongue on the roof of the mouth.

The following table lists the consonant phonemes of the language, with the pronunciation in IPA on the left and the orthography on the right:

#Two additional consonants, and , are found in borrowings. Both are spelled .
#Two additional consonants, and , are found in borrowings. Both are spelled .
#Two additional consonants, and , are found in loans. Both are spelled , as the sound .
#An additional consonant, is found in loans. It is spelled .
#The onset cluster from phonologized loanwords such as &quot;the clinic&quot; can be realized as a single consonant .
#The unwritten glottal stop is present in words like &quot;to iron&quot;, &quot;to stutter&quot;, &quot;to stall&quot;.
#In informal writing, this murmured consonant can sometimes be seen spelled as as in , but this is non-standard.
#Sequences of as in &quot;abandonment&quot; are phonologically realized , but this sound is non-phonemic.

In addition to the ejective affricate , the spelling may also be used for either of the aspirated affricates and .

The breathy voiced glottal fricative is sometimes spelled .

The ejectives tend to be ejective only in careful pronunciation or in salient positions and, even then, only for some speakers. Otherwise, they tend to be tenuis (plain) stops. Similarly, the tenuis (plain) clicks are often glottalised, with a long voice onset time, but that is uncommon.

The murmured clicks, plosives and affricates are only partially voiced, with the following vowel murmured for some speakers. That is, may be pronounced (or, equivalently, ). They are better described as slack voiced than as breathy voiced. They are truly voiced only after nasals, but the oral occlusion is then very short in stops, and it usually does not occur at all in clicks. Therefore, the absolute duration of voicing is the same as in tenuis stops. (They may also be voiced between vowels in some speaking styles.) The more notable characteristic is their depressor effect on the tone of the syllable.

====Consonant changes with prenasalisation====

When consonants are prenasalised, their pronunciation and spelling may change. The murmur no longer shifts to the following vowel. Fricatives become affricated and, if voiceless, they become ejectives as well: &quot;mf&quot; is pronounced , &quot;ndl&quot; is pronounced , &quot;n+hl&quot; becomes &quot;ntl&quot; , &quot;n+z&quot; becomes &quot;ndz&quot; , &quot;n&quot;+&quot;q&quot; becomes [n͡ŋǃʼ] &quot;etc.&quot; The orthographic &quot;b&quot; in &quot;mb&quot; is the voiced plosive . Prenasalisation occurs in several contexts, including on roots with the class 9 prefix /iN-/, for example on an adjective which is feature-matching its noun:

/iN- + ɬɛ/ &quot;→&quot; intle&quot;beautiful&quot; (of a class 9 word like &quot;inja&quot; &quot;dog&quot;)

When aspirated clicks () are prenasalised, the silent letter is added () to prevent confusion with the nasal clicks , and are actually distinct sounds. The prenasalized versions have a very short voicing at the onset which then releases in an ejective, like the prenasalized affricates, while the phonemically nasal clicks have a very long voicing through the consonant. When plain voiceless clicks () are prenasalized, they become slack voiced nasal ().

====Consonant changes with palatalisation====

Palatalisation is a change that affects labial consonants whenever they are immediately followed by . While palatalisation occurred historically, it is still productive, as is shown by palatalization before the passive suffix /-w/ and before diminutive suffix /-ana/. This process can skip rightwards to non-local syllables (i.e. uku-sebenz-is-el + wa -&gt; ukusetyenziselwa &quot;be used for&quot;), but does not affect morpheme-initial consonants (i.e. uku-bhal+wa -&gt; ukubhalwa &quot;to be written&quot;, instead of illicit *ukujalwa). The palatalization process only applies once, as evidenced by ukuphuphumisa+wa -&gt; ukuphuphunyiswa &quot;to be made to overflow&quot;, instead of the illicit alternative, *ukuphutshunyiswa.

==Morphology==
In keeping with many other Bantu languages, Xhosa is an agglutinative language, with an array of prefixes and suffixes that are attached to root words. As in other Bantu languages, nouns in Xhosa are classified into morphological classes, or genders (15 in Xhosa), with different prefixes for both singular and plural. Various parts of speech that qualify a noun must agree with the noun according to its gender. Agreements usually reflect part of the original class with which the word agrees. The word order is subject–verb–object, like in English.

The verb is modified by affixes to mark subject, object, tense, aspect and mood. The various parts of the sentence must agree in both class and number.

===Nouns===

The Xhosa noun consists of two essential parts, the prefix and the stem. Using the prefixes, nouns can be grouped into noun classes, which are numbered consecutively, to ease comparison with other Bantu languages. Which they call &#x27;amahlelo&#x27;
The following table gives an overview of Xhosa noun classes, arranged according to singular-plural pairs.

1 Before monosyllabic stems, e.g. (eye), (list).

2 is- and iz- replace isi- and izi- respectively before stems beginning with a vowel, e.g. / (hand/hands).

3 The placeholder N in the prefixes iN- and iiN- is a nasal consonant which assimilates in place to the following consonant (producing an im- before vowels), but is typically absent in loanwords.

4 Before monosyllabic stems in some words.

===Verbs===

Verbs use the following prefixes for the subject and object:

===Examples===
: ukudlala – to play
: ukubona – to see
: umntwana – a child
: abantwana – children

: umntwana uyadlala – the child is playing
: abantwana bayadlala – the children are playing

: indoda – a man
: amadoda – men

: indoda iya&quot;m&quot;bona &quot;um&quot;ntwana – the man sees the child
: amadoda aya&quot;ba&quot;bona &quot;aba&quot;ntwana – the men see the children

== Sample phrases and text ==
The following is a list of phrases that can be used when one visits a region whose primary language is Xhosa:
==History==

Xhosa-speaking people have inhabited coastal regions of southeastern Africa since before the 16th century. They refer to themselves as the &quot;amaXhosa&quot; and their language as &quot;isiXhosa&quot;. Ancestors of the Xhosa migrated to the east coast of Africa and came across Khoisan-speaking people; &quot;as a result of this contact, the Xhosa people borrowed some Khoisan words along with their pronunciation, for instance, the click sounds of the Khoisan languages&quot;. The Bantu ancestor of Xhosa did not have clicks, which attests to a strong historical contact with a Khoisan language that did. An estimated 15% of Xhosa vocabulary is of Khoisan origin.

John Bennie was a Scottish Presbyterian missionary and early Xhosa linguist. Bennie, along with John Ross (another missionary), set up a printing press in the Tyhume Valley and the first printed works in Xhosa came out in 1823 from the Lovedale Press in the Alice region of the Eastern Cape. But, as with any language, Xhosa had a rich history of oral traditions from which the society taught, informed, and entertained one another. The first Bible translation was in 1859, produced in part by Henry Hare Dugmore.

==Role in modern society==

The role of indigenous languages in South Africa is complex and ambiguous. Their use in education has been governed by legislation, beginning with the Bantu Education Act, 1953.

At present, Xhosa is used as the main language of instruction in many primary schools and some secondary schools, but is largely replaced by English after the early primary grades, even in schools mainly serving Xhosa-speaking communities. The language is also studied as a subject in such schools.

The language of instruction at universities in South Africa is English (or Afrikaans, to a diminishing extent), and Xhosa is taught as a subject, both for native and for non-native speakers.

Literary works, including prose and poetry, are available in Xhosa, as are newspapers and magazines. The South African Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts in Xhosa on both radio (on Umhlobo Wenene FM) and television, and films, plays and music are also produced in the language. The best-known performer of Xhosa songs outside South Africa was Miriam Makeba, whose &quot;Click Song #1&quot; (Xhosa &quot;Qongqothwane&quot;) and &quot;Click Song #2&quot; (&quot;Baxabene Ooxam&quot;) are known for their large number of click sounds.

, the literacy rate for first-language Xhosa speakers was estimated at 50%.

===Anthem===

&quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; is part of the national anthem of South Africa, national anthem of Tanzania and Zambia, and the former anthem of Zimbabwe and Namibia. It is a hymn written in Xhosa by Enoch Sontonga in 1897. The single original stanza was:

: &quot;Nkosi, sikelel&#x27; iAfrika;&quot;
: &quot;Maluphakanyis&#x27; uphondo lwayo;&quot;
: &quot;Yizwa imithandazo yethu&quot;
: &quot;Nkosi sikelela, thina lusapho lwayo.&quot;

: Lord, bless Africa;
: May her horn rise high up;
: Hear Thou our prayers
: Lord, bless us, its family (, the family of Africa).

Additional stanzas were written later by Sontonga and other writers, and the original verse was translated into Sotho and Afrikaans, as well as English.

==In popular culture==
In The Lion King and its reboot, Rafiki the sagely mandrill chants in Xhosa.
In the Marvel Cinematic Universe films &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;, &quot;Black Panther&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&quot;, the language spoken in the fictional African nation of Wakanda is Xhosa. This came about because South African actor John Kani, a native of the Eastern Cape province who plays Wakandan King T&#x27;Chaka, speaks Xhosa and suggested that the directors of the fictional &quot;Civil War&quot; incorporate a dialogue in the language. For &quot;Black Panther&quot;, director Ryan Coogler &quot;wanted to make it a priority to use Xhosa as much as possible&quot; in the script, and provided dialect coaches for the film&#x27;s actors.

<doc id="95366" wikidata="Q1075948" url="?curid=95366" title="West Atlantic languages">
<text>The West Atlantic languages (also the Atlantic languages or North Atlantic languages) of West Africa are a major subgroup of the Niger–Congo languages.

The Atlantic languages are spoken along the Atlantic coast from Senegal to Liberia, though transhumant Fula speakers have spread eastward and are found in large numbers across the Sahel, from Senegal to Nigeria, Cameroon and Sudan. Wolof of Senegal and several of the Fula languages are the most populous Atlantic languages, with several million speakers each. Other significant members include Serer and the Jola dialect cluster of Senegal. Temne, a major language of Sierra Leone, was included in the Atlantic subgroup in earlier classifications but in modern proposals, it is no longer grouped within Atlantic.

Most Atlantic languages exhibit consonant mutation and have noun-class systems similar to those of the distantly related Bantu languages. Some languages are tonal, while others such as Wolof have pitch-accent systems. The basic word order tends to be SVO.

==Classification and scope==
===Traditional classification===
The Atlantic family was first identified by Sigismund Koelle in 1854. In the early 20th century, Carl Meinhof claimed that Fula was a Hamitic language, but August von Klingenhaben and Joseph Greenberg&#x27;s work established Fula&#x27;s close relationship with Wolof and Serer. W. A. A. Wilson notes that the validity of the family as a whole rests on much weaker evidence, though it is clear that the languages are part of the Niger–Congo family, based on evidence such as a shared noun-class system. However, comparative work on Niger–Congo is in its infancy. Classifications of Niger–Congo, usually based on lexicostatistics, generally propose that the various Atlantic languages are rather divergent, but less so than Mande and other languages that lack noun classes.

David Sapir (1971) proposed a classification of Atlantic into three branches, a northern group, a southern group, and the divergent Bijago language of the Bissagos Islands off the coast of Guinea-Bissau:
*Atlantic
**Northern
***Sénégal languages: Fula–Serer; Wolof
***Cangin languages
***Bak languages (not including Bijago)
***Eastern Sénégal–Portuguese Guinea languages
****Tenda languages
****Biafada–Pajade
****Kobiana–Kasanga–Banhum
****Nalu–Mbulungish–Baga Mboteni
**Bijago
**Southern
***Sua
***Mel languages (including Gola)
***Limba
Sapir&#x27;s classification is widely cited in handbooks on African linguistics (e.g. Bender 1989, Williamson &amp; Blench 2000), and is also used in the Ethnologue (22nd ed., 2019).

===Recent proposals===
The unity of the Atlantic languages—as traditionally defined—has long been questioned, e.g. Dalby (1965), who argued for the Mel languages as a primary branch of Niger–Congo. At the current state of research, the wide concept of Atlantic (i.e. including the Southern languages) within the Niger–Congo family is no longer held up.

Segerer (2010, 2016) and Pozdniakov &amp; Segerer (2017) propose a narrowed-down version of the Atlantic languages by excluding all languages of the southern branch, which they treat as four primary branches (viz. Sua, Limba, Gola, and the Mel languages) within the Niger–Congo family. The Bak languages are split from the northern languages as a coordinate subbranch within Atlantic (in the narrow sense). Bijago is assigned to the Bak languages.

Güldemann (2018) goes even further, and also treats Nalu and Mbulungish–Baga Mboteni (&quot;Rio Nunez&quot;) as unclassified first-order branches of Niger–Congo.

====Vossen &amp; Dimmendaal (2020)====
Revised classification of the Atlantic languages (Vossen &amp; Dimmendaal 2020:166, from Pozdniakov &amp; Segerer):
*Atlantic
**North
***Wolof: Wolof, Lebu
***Nyun-Buy
****Nyun (Gunyaamolo, Gujaher, Gubëeher, etc.)
****Buy (Kasanga, Kobiana)
***Tenda-Jaad
****Tenda: Basari, Tanda, Bedik, Bapen; Konyagi
****Jaad: Biafada; Badiaranke
***Fula-Sereer
****Fula (Pular, Pulaar, Fulfulde, etc.)
****Sereer
***Cangin
****Palor, Ndut
****Noon, Laala, Saafi
***Nalu
****Nalu
****Bage Fore
****Baga Mboteni
**Bak
***Balant: Ganja, Kentohe, Fraase
***Joola-Manjaku
****Joola: Fogny, Banjal, Kasa, Kwaatay, Karon, Ejamat, Keeraak, etc.; Bayot ?
****Manjaku
****Bok, Cur, Bassarel
****Pepel
****Mankanya
***Bijogo: Kamona, Kagbaaga, Kajoko
====Merrill (2021)====
Merrill (2021) proposes that Atlantic (or North Atlantic) is not a valid subgroup of Niger-Congo, but rather considers each of the established Atlantic &quot;branches&quot; to all be primary branches of Niger-Congo. Furthermore, Merrill suggests that due to the divergence of the Atlantic languages, the homeland of Niger-Congo may lie in the northwest of sub-Saharan Africa.
*North Atlantic geographical area
**Fula-Sereer (branch)
***Fula
***Sereer
**Cangin
**Wolof
**Bainunk-Kobiana-Kasanga (branch)
***Kobiana
***Gujaher
***Gubëeher
***Guñaamolo
**Biafada-Pajade (branch)
***Pajade
***Biafada
**Tenda (branch)
***Konyagi
***Bassari
***Bedik
**Bak (branch)
***Joola
***Manjak
***Balanta
**Bijogo (branch)
Merrill (2021) also notes that Tenda and Biafada-Pajade share similarities with each other, and may possibly form a linkage.

<doc id="95371" wikidata="Q32515" url="?curid=95371" title="London Borough of Richmond upon Thames">
<text>The London Borough of Richmond upon Thames () in south-west London, England, forms part of Outer London and is the only London borough on both sides of the River Thames. It was created in 1965 when three smaller council areas amalgamated under the London Government Act 1963. It is governed by Richmond upon Thames London Borough Council. The population is 198,019 and the major communities are Barnes, East Sheen, Mortlake, Kew, Richmond, Twickenham, Teddington and Hampton.

The borough is home to Richmond Park, the largest park in London, along with the National Physical Laboratory and The National Archives. Kew Gardens, Hampton Court Palace, Twickenham Stadium and the WWT London Wetlands Centre are within its boundaries and draw domestic and international tourism. In 2023, the borough was ranked first in Rightmove&#x27;s &quot;Happy at Home&quot; index, making it the &quot;happiest place to live in Great Britain&quot;; the first time a London borough has taken the top spot.

==History==
There had been a borough called Richmond since 1890 when the Municipal Borough of Richmond was created. It was enlarged in 1892 to include Kew, Petersham and North Sheen, and again in 1933 to include Ham.

The larger London Borough of Richmond upon Thames was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, covering the combined area of the former borough of Richmond plus the neighbouring Municipal Borough of Barnes and the Municipal Borough of Twickenham. Barnes and Richmond had both been in Surrey prior to the reforms, whilst Twickenham had been in Middlesex. The area was transferred to Greater London to become one of the 32 London boroughs. The new borough was named &#x27;Richmond upon Thames&#x27; rather than just Richmond as the old borough had been called; it is the only London borough to straddle the River Thames.

Minor boundary changes have occurred since its creation. The most significant amendments were made in 1994 and 1995, when areas of Richmond Park were transferred from the London Borough of Wandsworth and the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames.

==Geography==
The borough is approximately half parkland, with notable parks including Richmond Park, Bushy Park, Kew Gardens, Old Deer Park and Hampton Court Park. There are over 100 parks and open spaces in the borough and of river frontage. 140 hectares within the borough are designated as part of the Metropolitan Green Belt.

The predominant other land use is residential. Most businesses within the borough consist of retail, property improvement/development and professional services. Parts of the borough, including Barnes, Richmond, St Margarets, Cambridge Park and Marble Hill, some areas of Twickenham and much of East Sheen rival Stanmore Hill and Kenley as the highest house-price districts and neighbourhoods in Outer London.
The borough is home to the National Physical Laboratory and the attractions of Hampton Court Palace, Twickenham Stadium and the WWT London Wetlands Centre that draw domestic and international tourism.

The River Thames becomes narrower than at any part of Inner London towards its flow into the borough and becomes non-tidal at Teddington Lock in the borough; its main axis runs south to north, rather than west to east through more than half of the borough.
London&#x27;s German business and expatriate community is centred on this borough, which houses the German School London (DSL) and most of the capital&#x27;s German expatriates.

===Climate===
===List of neighbourhoods===
The local authority divides the borough into fourteen loosely bounded neighbourhoods, or &quot;villages&quot;. Some of the neighbourhoods have the same name as their associated political ward, but the boundaries are not officially aligned. There is also no direct alignment between these areas and postcode districts, which tend to cover much broader areas, crossing the borough boundaries. There are four post towns based in the borough: Hampton, Richmond, Teddington and Twickenham. Parts of the borough come under the London post town, including Barnes and Mortlake, and there are several other peripheral parts of post towns based in neighbouring boroughs which straddle the administrative boundary. Although most addresses in the borough have TW postcodes, some have SW and KT postcodes.


==Governance==
The council meets at York House in Twickenham and has its main offices at the adjoining Civic Centre at 44 York Street.

===Greater London representation===
Since 2000, for elections to the London Assembly, the borough forms part of the South West constituency, currently represented by the AM Gareth Roberts.

===Parliamentary representation===
The borough is split between three constituencies. The entire portion of the borough south of the River Thames is included in the Richmond Park constituency, which also contains some of the northern wards of the borough of Kingston.

Most of the portion of the borough north of the river forms the constituency of Twickenham, which does not contain wards from any other borough. However, since the 2024 general election, the borough&#x27;s northernmost ward on this side of the Thames, Whitton, has instead been included in the constituency of Brentford and Isleworth, the remainder of which consists of wards from the London Borough of Hounslow.

Prior to the 2024 election, the entirety of the borough north of the Thames had formed the entirety of the Twickenham constituency since 1997.

==Demography==

In 2006, research commissioned by a major mortgage lender found that, on the quantitative statistical indices used, the borough had the best quality of life in London and was in the top quarter of local authorities nationwide. A neighbouring authority in Surrey achieved the best quality of life in that report.

Richmond is one of London&#x27;s wealthiest boroughs on many measures. It has the lowest rates of poverty, child poverty, low pay, child obesity and adults without level 3 qualifications of any London borough, according to a 2017 research project by Trust for London.

Demography is a diverse picture as in all of London: each district should be looked at separately and even those do not reflect all neighbourhoods. Whatever generalisations are used, &quot;the fine-grained texture of London poverty&quot; by its minutely localised geography must always be taken into account according to an influential poverty report of 2010. Richmond upon Thames has the lowest child poverty rates in London at 20% and contains at least one ward with an above-average level (for London) of working-age adults receiving out-of-work benefits but even this borough – reflecting the best result – has two standard poverty indices of sixteen in which it is placed in the worst quarter of boroughs.

===Ethnicity===


===Coat of arms===
The borough&#x27;s history is reflected in the coat of arms, which was officially granted on 7 May 1966. It is: &quot;Ermine a portcullis or within a bordure gules charged with eight fleurs-de-lis or&quot;. The crest is: &quot;On a wreath argent and gules out of a mural crown gules a swan rousant argent in beak a branch of climbing red roses leaved and entwined about the neck proper.&quot; The supporters are: &quot;On either side a griffin gules, armed and beaked azure, each supporting an oar proper, the blade of the dexter dark blue and that of the sinister light blue.&quot; The portcullis was taken from the arms of the Municipal Borough of Richmond; the swan crest, from the arms of the Municipal Borough of Twickenham; and the griffin supporters and shield from the arms of the Municipal Borough of Barnes. Red, gold and ermine are the royal livery colours, reflecting Richmond&#x27;s royal history. The swan represents the River Thames, which flows through the borough. The oars are from the Oxford University Boat Club and the Cambridge University Boat Club, reflecting the fact that the Boat Race between the two universities ends at Mortlake in the borough.

==Transport==
=== Aviation ===
London Heathrow Airport is located a short distance west, in the London Borough of Hillingdon.

===Buses===
The borough is served by many Transport for London bus routes.

===Rail services===
 The borough is connected to central London and Reading by the National Rail services of the South Western Railway.

Richmond upon Thames is not very well served by the London Underground compared with other boroughs in West London. Two stations, served by the District line, are located towards the borough&#x27;s northeastern end: Richmond and Kew Gardens. Both are also served by London Overground trains on the North London line, which connects Richmond with inner North London before terminating in Stratford. The southwestern end of the district, encompassing areas such as Twickenham are served instead by suburban railway services.

The other stations are: Barnes; Barnes Bridge; Fulwell; Hampton; Hampton Wick; Mortlake; North Sheen; St Margarets; Strawberry Hill; Teddington; Twickenham and Whitton.

==Education==

Richmond upon Thames is the local education authority for the borough.

Richmond upon Thames College opened in 1977 and was the first tertiary college in Greater London. The borough adopted a tertiary post-16 provision with virtually all 16-19 studies taking place at this college. This system lasted until 2012 when the council approved the creation of sixth forms in schools. Additionally the council approved the creation of a Catholic secondary school for the first time in the borough.

==Sport and leisure==

The borough has a non-League football club, Hampton &amp; Richmond Borough F.C., who play at Beveree Stadium in Hampton. Twickenham Stadium hosts rugby internationals and the Twickenham Stoop is home to the Harlequins Rugby Team.

Richmond Rugby Club are also active and share their grounds with London Scottish F.C. The Richmond Minis is a large youth rugby organisation whilst the Richmond Heavies organise games for more veteran players.

Cricket is played in many locations around the borough including Ham Common, Richmond Green and Kew Green.

The River Thames flows through the borough and a number of sailing and rowing clubs are located along it. Richmond Canoe Club is situation a short distance up river from Richmond Bridge

The borough has a large amount of equestrian activity; this includes the Horse Rangers Association and Ham Polo Club.

Richmond&#x27;s swimming pools, Pools on the Park, are located in Old Deer Park close to the town centre. The outdoor pool is open in the summer months only. There is also a heated outdoor pool in Hampton.

==Arts and culture==
The Twickenham Museum is a volunteer-run museum opposite St Mary&#x27;s parish church.
The Museum of Richmond, in Richmond&#x27;s Old Town Hall, close to Richmond Bridge, has displays relating to the history of Richmond, Ham, Petersham and Kew. Its rotating exhibitions, education activities and a programme of events cover the whole of the modern borough. The museum&#x27;s highlights include 16th-century glass from Richmond Palace and a painting, &quot;The Terrace and View from Richmond Hill, Surrey&quot; by Dutch draughtsman and painter Leonard Knyff (1650–1722), which is part of the Richmond upon Thames Borough Art Collection.

Orleans House Gallery in Twickenham displays material from the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames&#x27; art collection. This includes a portrait of James Johnston by Thomas Gibson, paintings of Orleans House by Arthur Vickers and several other artists, and the Burton Collection, which includes artwork, personal effects and photographs of the explorer Richard Francis Burton. The gallery is also the site of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames&#x27; arts service and provides educational workshops for a wide variety of ages, using the converted stables and coach house as educational spaces.

Garrick&#x27;s Temple to Shakespeare in Hampton hosts a free Sunday afternoon Shakespeare exhibition from April to October and a series of summer drama, music and exhibitions.
Richmond has two theatres. The Richmond Theatre at the side of Little Green is a Victorian structure designed by Frank Matcham and restored and extended by Carl Toms in 1990. The theatre has a weekly schedule of plays and musicals, usually given by professional touring companies, and pre-West End shows can sometimes be seen. There is a Christmas and New Year pantomime tradition and many of Britain&#x27;s greatest music hall and pantomime performers have appeared here.

Close to Richmond railway station is the Orange Tree Theatre which was founded in 1971 in a room above the Orange Tree pub. As audience numbers increased there was pressure to find a more accommodating space and, in 1991, the company moved to current premises within a converted primary school. The 172-seat theatre was built specifically as a theatre in the round. It has acquired a national reputation for the quality of its work for staging new plays, and for discovering undeservedly forgotten old plays and neglected classics.

Performance group Richmond Opera rehearse regularly at The Vineyard Centre.

&quot;The Cabbage Patch&quot; pub on London Road near Twickenham railway station has, since 1983, been a regular venue for live music on Sunday nights, organised by TwickFolk.

In 2015, Barnes, London became home to London&#x27;s largest dedicated children&#x27;s book event, the Barnes Children&#x27;s Literature Festival, which is now the second largest in Europe.

<text>The Cunard Line ( ) is a British shipping and cruise line based at Carnival House at Southampton, England, operated by Carnival UK and owned by Carnival Corporation &amp; plc. Since 2011, Cunard and its four ships have been registered in Hamilton, Bermuda.

In 1839, Samuel Cunard was awarded the first British transatlantic steamship mail contract, and the next year formed the British and North American Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company in Glasgow with shipowner Sir George Burns together with Robert Napier, the famous Scottish steamship engine designer and builder, to operate the line&#x27;s four pioneer paddle steamers on the Liverpool–Halifax–Boston route. For most of the next 30 years, Cunard held the Blue Riband for the fastest Atlantic voyage. However, in the 1870s Cunard fell behind its rivals, the White Star Line and the Inman Line. To meet this competition, in 1879 the firm was reorganised as the Cunard Steamship Company Ltd, to raise capital.

In 1902, White Star joined the American-owned International Mercantile Marine Co. In response, the British Government provided Cunard with substantial loans and a subsidy to build two superliners needed to retain Britain&#x27;s competitive position. &quot;Mauretania&quot; held the Blue Riband from 1909 to 1929. Her sister ship, &quot;Lusitania&quot;, was torpedoed in 1915 during the First World War.

In 1919, Cunard relocated its British homeport from Liverpool to Southampton, better to cater for travellers from London. In the late 1920s, Cunard faced new competition when the Germans, Italians and French built large prestige liners. Cunard was forced to suspend construction on its own new superliner because of the Great Depression. In 1934, the British Government offered Cunard loans to finish &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and to build a second ship, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, on the condition that Cunard merged with the then-ailing White Star Line to form Cunard-White Star Line. Cunard owned two-thirds of the new company. Cunard purchased White Star&#x27;s share in 1947; the name reverted to the Cunard Line in 1950.

Upon the end of the Second World War, Cunard regained its position as the largest Atlantic passenger line. By the mid-1950s, it operated 12 ships to the United States and Canada. After 1958, transatlantic passenger ships became increasingly unprofitable because of the introduction of jet airliners. Cunard undertook a brief foray into air travel via the &quot;Cunard Eagle&quot; and &quot;BOAC Cunard&quot; airlines, but withdrew from the airline market in 1966. Cunard withdrew from its year-round service in 1968 to concentrate on cruising and summer transatlantic voyages for holiday makers. The Queens were replaced by &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; (&quot;QE2&quot;), which was designed for the dual role.

In 1998, Cunard was acquired by the Carnival Corporation, and accounted for 8.7% of that company&#x27;s revenue in 2012. In 2004, &quot;QE2&quot; was replaced on the transatlantic runs by &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot; (&quot;QM2&quot;). The line also operates &quot;Queen Victoria&quot; (&quot;QV&quot;) and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; (&quot;QE&quot;). As of 2022, Cunard is the only shipping company to still operate a scheduled passenger service between Europe and North America.

In 2017, Cunard announced a fourth ship would join its fleet. This was initially scheduled for 2022 but delayed until 2024 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ship has since been named .

==History==

===Early years: 1840–1850===

The British Government started operating monthly mail brigs from Falmouth, Cornwall, to New York in 1756. These ships carried few non-governmental passengers and no cargo. In 1818, the Black Ball Line opened a regularly scheduled New York–Liverpool service with clipper ships, beginning an era when American sailing packets dominated the North Atlantic saloon-passenger trade that lasted until the introduction of steamships. A Committee of Parliament decided in 1836 that to become more competitive, the mail packets operated by the Post Office should be replaced by private shipping companies. The Admiralty assumed responsibility for managing the contracts. The famed Arctic explorer Admiral Sir William Edward Parry was appointed as Comptroller of Steam Machinery and Packet Service in April 1837. Nova Scotians led by their young Assembly Speaker, Joseph Howe, lobbied for steam service to Halifax. On his arrival in London in May 1838, Howe discussed the enterprise with his fellow Nova Scotian Samuel Cunard (1787–1865), a shipowner who was also visiting London on business. Cunard and Howe were associates and Howe also owed Cunard £300 (). Cunard returned to Halifax to raise capital, and Howe continued to lobby the British government. The Rebellions of 1837–1838 were ongoing and London realised that the proposed Halifax service was also important for the military.

That November, Parry released a tender for North Atlantic monthly mail service to Halifax beginning in April 1839 using steamships with 300 horsepower. The Great Western Steamship Company, which had opened its pioneer Bristol–New York service earlier that year, bid £45,000 for a monthly Bristol–Halifax–New York service using three ships of 450 horsepower. While British American, the other pioneer transatlantic steamship company, did not submit a tender, the St George Steam Packet Company, owner of &quot;Sirius&quot;, bid £45,000 for a monthly Cork–Halifax service and £65,000 for a monthly Cork–Halifax–New York service. The Admiralty rejected both tenders because neither bid offered to begin services early enough.

Cunard, who was back in Halifax, did not know of the tender until after the deadline. He returned to London and started negotiations with Admiral Parry, who was Cunard&#x27;s good friend from when Parry was a young officer stationed in Halifax 20 years earlier. Cunard offered Parry a fortnightly service beginning in May 1840. While Cunard did not then own a steamship, he had been an investor in an earlier steamship venture, &quot;Royal William&quot;, and owned coal mines in Nova Scotia. Cunard&#x27;s major backer was Robert Napier whose Robert Napier and Sons was the Royal Navy&#x27;s supplier of steam engines. He also had the strong backing of Nova Scotian political leaders at the time when London needed to rebuild support in British North America after the rebellion.
Over Great Western&#x27;s protests, in May 1839 Parry accepted Cunard&#x27;s tender of £55,000 for a three-ship Liverpool–Halifax service with an extension to Boston and a supplementary service to Montreal. The annual subsidy was later raised £81,000 to add a fourth ship and departures from Liverpool were to be monthly during the winter and fortnightly for the rest of the year. Parliament investigated Great Western&#x27;s complaints, and upheld the Admiralty&#x27;s decision. Napier and Cunard recruited other investors including businessmen James Donaldson, Sir George Burns, and David MacIver. In May 1840, just before the first ship was ready, they formed the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company with initial capital of £270,000, later increased to £300,000 (£ in ). Cunard supplied £55,000. Burns supervised ship construction, MacIver was responsible for day-to-day operations, and Cunard was the &quot;first among equals&quot; in the management structure. When MacIver died in 1845, his younger brother Charles assumed his responsibilities for the next 35 years. (For more detail of the first investors in the Cunard Line and also the early life of Charles MacIver, see Liverpool Nautical Research Society&#x27;s &quot;Second Merseyside Maritime History&quot;, pp. 33–37 1991.)

In May 1840 the coastal paddle steamer &quot;Unicorn&quot; made the company&#x27;s first voyage to Halifax to begin the supplementary service to Montreal. Two months later the first of the four ocean-going steamers of the &quot;Britannia Class&quot;, departed Liverpool. By coincidence, the steamer&#x27;s departure had patriotic significance on both sides of the Atlantic: she was named &quot;Britannia&quot;, and sailed on 4 July. Even on her maiden voyage, however, her performance indicated that the new era she heralded would be much more beneficial for Britain than the US. At a time when the typical packet ship might take several weeks to cross the Atlantic, &quot;Britannia&quot; reached Halifax in 12 days and 10 hours, averaging 8.5 knots (15.7 km/h), before proceeding to Boston. Such relatively brisk crossings quickly became the norm for the Cunard Line: during 1840–41, mean Liverpool–Halifax times for the quartet were 13 days 6 hours to Halifax and 11 days 4 hours homeward. Two larger ships were quickly ordered, one to replace the &quot;Columbia&quot;, which sank at Seal Island, Nova Scotia, in 1843 without loss of life. By 1845, steamship lines led by Cunard carried more saloon passengers than the sailing packets. Three years later, the British Government increased the annual subsidy to £156,000 so that Cunard could double its frequency. Four additional wooden paddlers were ordered and alternate sailings were direct to New York instead of the Halifax–Boston route. The sailing packet lines were now reduced to the immigrant trade.

From the beginning Cunard&#x27;s ships used the line&#x27;s distinctive red funnel with two or three narrow black bands and black top. It appears that Robert Napier was responsible for this feature. His shipyard in Glasgow used this combination previously in 1830 on Thomas Assheton Smith&#x27;s private steam yacht &quot;Menai&quot;. The renovation of her model by Glasgow Museum of Transport revealed that she had vermilion funnels with black bands and black top. The line also adopted a naming convention that utilised words ending in &quot;IA&quot;.

Cunard&#x27;s reputation for safety was one of the significant factors in the firm&#x27;s early success. Both of the first transatlantic lines failed after major accidents: the British and American line collapsed after the &quot;President&quot; foundered in a gale, and the Great Western Steamship Company failed after &quot;Great Britain&quot; stranded because of a navigation error. Cunard&#x27;s orders to his masters were, &quot;Your ship is loaded, take her; speed is nothing, follow your own road, deliver her safe, bring her back safe – safety is all that is required.&quot; In particular, Charles MacIver&#x27;s constant inspections were responsible for the firm&#x27;s safety discipline.

===New Competition: 1850–1879===

 In 1850 the American Collins Line and the British Inman Line started new Atlantic steamship services. The American Government supplied Collins with a large annual subsidy to operate four wooden paddlers that were superior to Cunard&#x27;s best, as they demonstrated with three Blue Riband-winning voyages between 1850 and 1854. Meanwhile, Inman showed that iron-hulled, screw propelled steamers of modest speed could be profitable without subsidy. Inman also became the first steamship line to carry steerage passengers. Both of the newcomers suffered major disasters in 1854. The next year, Cunard put pressure on Collins by commissioning its first iron-hulled paddler, &quot;Persia&quot;. That pressure may well have been a factor in a second major disaster suffered by the Collins Line, the loss of its steamer &quot;Pacific&quot;. &quot;Pacific&quot; sailed out of Liverpool just a few days before &quot;Persia&quot; was due to depart on her maiden voyage, and was never seen again; it was widely assumed at the time that the captain had pushed his ship to the limit to stay ahead of the new Cunarder, and had likely collided with an iceberg during what was a particularly severe winter in the North Atlantic. A few months later &quot;Persia&quot; inflicted a further blow to the Collins Line, regaining the Blue Riband with a Liverpool–New York voyage of 9 days 16 hours, averaging .
During the Crimean War Cunard supplied 11 ships for war service. Every British North Atlantic route was suspended until 1856 except Cunard&#x27;s Liverpool–Halifax–Boston service. While Collins&#x27; fortunes improved because of the lack of competition during the war, it collapsed in 1858 after its subsidy for carrying mail across the Atlantic was reduced by the US Congress. Cunard emerged as the leading carrier of saloon passengers and in 1862 commissioned &quot;Scotia&quot;, the last paddle steamer to win the Blue Riband. Inman carried more passengers because of its success in the immigrant trade. To compete, in May 1863 Cunard started a secondary Liverpool–New York service with iron-hulled screw steamers that catered for steerage passengers. Beginning with &quot;China&quot;, the line also replaced the last three wooden paddlers on the New York mail service with iron screw steamers that only carried saloon passengers.

When Cunard died in 1865, the equally conservative Charles MacIver assumed Cunard&#x27;s role. The firm retained its reluctance about change and was overtaken by competitors that more quickly adopted new technology. In 1866 Inman started to build screw propelled express liners that matched Cunard&#x27;s premier unit, &quot;Scotia&quot;. Cunard responded with its first high speed screw propellered steamer, &quot;Russia&quot; which was followed by two larger editions. In 1871 both companies faced a new rival when the White Star Line commissioned the &quot;Oceanic&quot; and her five sisters. The new White Star record-breakers were especially economical because of their use of compound engines. White Star also set new standards for comfort by placing the dining saloon midships and doubling the size of cabins. Inman rebuilt its express fleet to the new standard, but Cunard lagged behind both of its rivals. Throughout the 1870s Cunard passage times were longer than either White Star or Inman.
In 1867 responsibility for mail contracts was transferred back to the Post Office and opened for bid. Cunard, Inman and the German Norddeutscher Lloyd were each awarded one of the three weekly New York mail services. The fortnightly route to Halifax formerly held by Cunard went to Inman. Cunard continued to receive an £80,000 subsidy (equivalent to £ in ), while NDL and Inman were paid sea postage. Two years later the service was rebid and Cunard was awarded a seven-year contract for two weekly New York mail services at £70,000 per annum. Inman was awarded a seven-year contract for the third weekly New York service at £35,000 per year.

The Panic of 1873 started a five-year shipping depression that strained the finances of all of the Atlantic competitors. In 1876 the mail contracts expired and the Post Office ended both Cunard&#x27;s and Inman&#x27;s subsidies. The new contracts were paid on the basis of weight, at a rate substantially higher than paid by the United States Post Office. Cunard&#x27;s weekly New York mail sailings were reduced to one and White Star was awarded the third mail sailing. Every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday a liner from one of the three firms departed Liverpool with the mail for New York.

===Cunard Steamship Company Ltd: 1879–1934===
To raise additional capital, in 1879 the privately held British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company was reorganised as a public stock corporation, the Cunard Steamship Company, Ltd. Under Cunard&#x27;s new chairman, John Burns (1839–1900), son of one of the firm&#x27;s original founders, Cunard commissioned four steel-hulled express liners beginning with of 1881, the first passenger liner with electric lighting throughout. In 1884, Cunard purchased the almost new Blue Riband winner from the Guion Line when that firm defaulted on payments to the shipyard. That year, Cunard also commissioned the record-breakers and capable of . Starting in 1887, Cunard&#x27;s newly won leadership on the North Atlantic was threatened when Inman and then White Star responded with twin screw record-breakers. In 1893 Cunard countered with two even faster Blue Riband winners, and , capable of .
No sooner had Cunard re-established its supremacy than new rivals emerged. Beginning in the late 1860s several German firms commissioned liners that were almost as fast as the British mail steamers from Liverpool. In 1897 of Norddeutscher Lloyd raised the Blue Riband to , and was followed by a succession of German record-breakers. Rather than match the new German speedsters, White Star – a rival which Cunard line would merge with – commissioned four very profitable Big Four ocean liners of more moderate speed for its secondary Liverpool–New York service. In 1902 White Star joined the well-capitalized American combine, the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM), which owned the American Line, including the old Inman Line, and other lines. IMM also had trade agreements with Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. Negotiators approached Cunard&#x27;s management in late 1901 and early 1902, but did not succeed in drawing the Cunard Line into IMM, then being formed with support of financier J. P. Morgan.

British prestige was at stake. The British Government provided Cunard with an annual subsidy of £150,000 plus a low interest loan of £2.5 million (equivalent to £ in ), to pay for the construction of the two superliners, the Blue Riband winners &#x27; and &#x27;, capable of . In 1903 the firm started a Fiume–New York service with calls at Italian ports and Gibraltar. The next year Cunard commissioned two ships to compete directly with the &quot;Celtic&quot;-class liners on the secondary Liverpool–New York route. In 1911 Cunard entered the St Lawrence trade by purchasing the Thompson line, and absorbed the Royal line five years later.

Not to be outdone, both White Star and Hamburg–America each ordered a trio of superliners. The White Star &#x27; liners at and the Hapag &#x27; liners at were larger and more luxurious than the Cunarders, but not as fast. Cunard also ordered a new ship, &#x27;, capable of , to complete the Liverpool mail fleet. Events prevented the expected competition between the three sets of superliners. White Star&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot; sank on its maiden voyage, both White Star&#x27;s &#x27; and Cunard&#x27;s &quot;Lusitania&quot; were war losses, and the three Hapag super-liners were handed over to the Allied powers as war reparations.

In 1916 Cunard Line completed its European headquarters in Liverpool, moving in on 12 June of that year. The grand neo-Classical Cunard Building was the third of Liverpool&#x27;s &quot;Three Graces&quot;. The headquarters were used by Cunard until the 1960s. In 1917, Cunard&#x27;s facilities were co-opted by the War Office to build aircraft for the expanding Royal Flying Corps, later the RAF.
Due to First World War losses, Cunard began a post-war rebuilding programme including eleven intermediate liners. It acquired the former Hapag (renamed &quot;Berengaria&quot;) to replace the lost &quot;Lusitania&quot; as the running mate for &quot;Mauretania&quot; and &quot;Aquitania&quot;, and Southampton replaced Liverpool as the British destination for the three-ship express service. By 1926 Cunard&#x27;s fleet was larger than before the war, and White Star was in decline, having been sold by IMM.

Despite the dramatic reduction in North Atlantic passengers caused by the shipping depression beginning in 1929, the Germans, Italians and the French commissioned new &quot;ships of state&quot; prestige liners. The German &#x27; took the Blue Riband at in 1933, the Italian &#x27; recorded on a westbound voyage the same year, and the French &quot;&quot; crossed the Atlantic in just under four days at in 1937. In 1930 Cunard ordered an 80,000-ton liner that was to be the first of two record-breakers fast enough to fit into a two-ship weekly Southampton–New York service. Work on &quot;Hull Number 534&quot; was halted in 1931 because of the economic conditions.

===Cunard-White Star Ltd: 1934–1949===


In 1934, both the Cunard Line and the White Star Line were experiencing financial difficulties. David Kirkwood, MP for Clydebank where the unfinished Hull Number 534 had been sitting idle for two and a half years, made a passionate plea in the House of Commons for funding to finish the ship and restart the dormant British economy. The government offered Cunard a loan of £3 million to complete Hull Number 534 and an additional £5 million to build a second ship, if Cunard merged with White Star.

The merger took place on 10 May 1934, creating Cunard-White Star Limited. The merger was accomplished with Cunard owning about two-thirds of the capital. Due to the surplus tonnage of the new combined Cunard White Star fleet many of the older liners were sent to the scrapyard; these included the ex-Cunard liner &quot;Mauretania&quot; and the ex-White Star liners &#x27; and . In 1936 the ex-White Star &#x27; was sold when Hull Number 534, now named &#x27;, replaced her in the express mail service. &quot;Queen Mary&quot; reached on her 1938 Blue Riband voyage. Cunard-White Star started construction on &#x27;, and a smaller ship, the second &quot;&quot;, joined the fleet and could also be used on the Atlantic run when one of the Queens was in drydock. The ex-Cunard liner &quot;Berengaria&quot; was sold for scrap in 1938 after a series of fires.
During the Second World War the Queens carried over two million servicemen and were credited by Churchill as helping to shorten the war by a year. All four of the large Cunard-White Star express liners, the two Queens, &quot;Aquitania&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot; survived, but many of the secondary ships were lost. Both and were sunk with heavy loss of life.

In 1947 Cunard purchased White Star&#x27;s interest, and by 1949 the company had dropped the White Star name and was renamed &quot;Cunard Line&quot;. Also in 1947 the company commissioned five freighters and two cargo liners. &quot;&quot;, was completed in 1949 as a permanent cruise liner and &quot;Aquitania&quot; was retired the next year.

===Disruption by airliners, Cunard Eagle and BOAC-Cunard: (1950–1968)===
Cunard was in an especially good position to take advantage of the increase in North Atlantic travel during the 1950s and the Queens were a major generator of US currency for Great Britain. Cunard&#x27;s slogan, &quot;Getting there is half the fun&quot;, was specifically aimed at the tourist trade. Beginning in 1954, Cunard took delivery of four new 22,000-GRT intermediate liners for the Canadian route and the Liverpool–New York route. The last White Star motor ship, &quot;&quot; of 1930, remained in service until 1960.

The introduction of jet airliners in 1958 heralded major change for the ocean liner industry. In 1960 a government-appointed committee recommended the construction of project Q3, a conventional 75,000 GRT liner to replace &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. Under the plan, the government would lend Cunard the majority of the liner&#x27;s cost. However, some Cunard stockholders questioned the plan at the June 1961 board meeting because transatlantic flights were gaining in popularity. By 1963 the plan had been changed to a dual-purpose 55,000 GRT ship designed to cruise in the off-season. The new vessel design was known as Q4. Ultimately, this ship came into service in 1969 as the 70,300 GRT .

Cunard attempted to address the challenge presented by jet airliners by diversifying its business into air travel. In March 1960, Cunard bought a 60% shareholding in British Eagle, an independent (non-government owned) airline, for £30 million, and changed its name to Cunard Eagle Airways. The support from this new shareholder enabled Cunard Eagle to become the first British independent airline to operate pure jet airliners, as a result of a £6 million order for two new Boeing 707–420 passenger aircraft. The order had been placed (including an option on a third aircraft) in expectation of being granted traffic rights for transatlantic scheduled services. The airline took delivery of its first Bristol Britannia aircraft on 5 April 1960 (on lease from Cubana). Cunard hoped to capture a significant share of the 1 million people that crossed the Atlantic by air in 1960. This was the first time more passengers chose to make their transatlantic crossing by air than sea. In June 1961, Cunard Eagle became the first independent airline in the UK to be awarded a licence by the newly constituted Air Transport Licensing Board (ATLB) to operate a scheduled service on the prime Heathrow – New York JFK route, but the licence was revoked in November 1961 after main competitor, state-owned BOAC, appealed to Aviation Minister Peter Thorneycroft. On 5 May 1962, the airline&#x27;s first 707 inaugurated scheduled jet services from London Heathrow to Bermuda and Nassau. The new jet service – marketed as the &quot;Cunarder Jet&quot; in the UK and as the &quot;Londoner&quot; in the western hemisphere – replaced the earlier Britannia operation on this route. Cunard Eagle succeeded in extending this service to Miami despite the loss of its original transatlantic scheduled licence and BOAC&#x27;s claim that there was insufficient traffic to warrant a direct service from the UK. A load factor of 56% was achieved at the outset. Inauguration of the first British through-plane service between London and Miami also helped Cunard Eagle increase utilisation of its 707s.
BOAC countered Eagle&#x27;s move to establish itself as a full-fledged scheduled transatlantic competitor on its Heathrow–JFK flagship route by forming BOAC-Cunard as a new £30 million joint venture with Cunard. BOAC contributed 70% of the new company&#x27;s capital and eight Boeing 707s. Cunard Eagle&#x27;s long-haul scheduled operation – including the two new 707s – was absorbed into BOAC-Cunard before delivery of the second 707, in June 1962. BOAC-Cunard leased any spare aircraft capacity to BOAC to augment the BOAC mainline fleet at peak times. As part of this deal, BOAC-Cunard also bought flying hours from BOAC for using the latter&#x27;s aircraft in the event of capacity shortfalls. This maximised combined fleet use. The joint fleet use agreement did not cover Cunard Eagle&#x27;s European scheduled, trooping and charter operations. However, the joint venture was not successful for Cunard and lasted only until 1966, when BOAC bought out Cunard&#x27;s share. Cunard also sold a majority holding in the remainder of Cunard Eagle back to its founder in 1963.

Within ten years of the introduction of jet airliners in 1958, most of the conventional Atlantic liners were gone. &quot;Mauretania&quot; was retired in 1965, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and &quot;Caronia&quot; in 1967, and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; in 1968. Two of the new intermediate liners were sold by 1970 and the other two were converted to cruise ships. All Cunard ships flew both the Cunard and White Star Line house flags until 4 November 1968, when the last White Star ship, &quot;Nomadic&quot; was withdrawn from service. After this, the White Star flag was no longer flown and all remnants of both White Star Line and Cunard-White Star Line were retired.

===Trafalgar House years: 1971–1998===

In 1971, when the line was purchased by the conglomerate Trafalgar House, Cunard operated cargo and passenger ships, hotels and resorts. Its cargo fleet consisted of 42 ships in service, with 20 on order. The flagship of the passenger fleet was the two-year-old &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;. The fleet also included the remaining two intermediate liners from the 1950s, plus two purpose-built cruise ships on order. Trafalgar acquired two additional cruise ships and disposed of the intermediate liners and most of the cargo fleet. During the Falklands War, &quot;QE2&quot; and &quot;Cunard Countess&quot; were chartered as troopships while Cunard&#x27;s container ship &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; was sunk by an Exocet missile.

Cunard acquired the Norwegian America Line in 1983, with two classic ocean liner/cruise ships. Also in 1983, the Trafalgar attempted a hostile takeover of P&amp;O, another large passenger and cargo shipping line, which was founded three years before Cunard. P&amp;O objected and forced the issue to the British Monopolies and Mergers Commission. In their filing, P&amp;O was critical of Trafalgar&#x27;s management of Cunard and their failure to correct &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;&#x27;s mechanical problems. In 1984, the Commission ruled in favour of the merger, but Trafalgar decided against proceeding. In 1988, Cunard acquired Ellerman Lines and its small fleet of cargo vessels, organising the business as Cunard-Ellerman, however, only a few years later, Cunard decided to abandon the cargo business and focus solely on cruise ships. Cunard&#x27;s cargo fleet was sold off between 1989 and 1991, with a single container ship, the second &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot;, remaining under Cunard ownership until 1996. In 1993, Cunard entered into a 10-year agreement to handle marketing, sales and reservations for the Crown Cruise Line, and its three vessels joined the Cunard fleet under the Cunard Crown banner. In 1994 Cunard purchased the rights to the name of the Royal Viking Line and its &quot;Royal Viking Sun&quot;. The rest of Royal Viking Line&#x27;s fleet stayed with the line&#x27;s owner, Norwegian Cruise Line.

By the mid-1990s Cunard was ailing. The company was embarrassed in late 1994 when &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; experienced numerous defects during the first voyage of the season because of unfinished renovation work. Claims from passengers cost the company US$13 million. After Cunard reported a US$25 million loss in 1995, Trafalgar assigned a new CEO to the line, who concluded that the company had management issues.

In 1996 the Norwegian conglomerate Kværner acquired Trafalgar House, and attempted to sell Cunard. When there were no takers, Kværner made substantial investments to turn around the company&#x27;s tarnished reputation.

===Carnival: from 1998–present===

In 1998, the cruise line conglomerate Carnival Corporation acquired 62% of Cunard for US$425 million. Coincidently, it was the same percentage that Cunard owned in Cunard-White Star Line and the company historian later stated the acquisition was in-part due to the success of James Cameron’s blockbuster 1997 film, &quot;Titanic&quot;. The next year Carnival acquired the remaining 38% and stock for US$205 million. Ultimately, Carnival sued Kværner claiming that the ships were in worse condition than represented and Kværner agreed to refund US$50 million to Carnival. Each of Carnival&#x27;s cruise lines is designed to appeal to a different market, and Carnival was interested in rebuilding Cunard as a luxury brand trading on its British traditions. Under the slogan &quot;Advancing Civilization Since 1840&quot;, Cunard&#x27;s advertising campaign sought to emphasise the elegance and mystique of ocean travel. Only &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; and &quot;Caronia&quot; continued under the Cunard brand and the company began Project &quot;Queen Mary&quot; to build a new ocean liner/cruise ship for the transatlantic route.

Following the Carnival acquisition, Cunard Line introduced &quot;White Star Service&quot; to &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; and &quot;Caronia&quot;, as a reference to the high standards of customer service expected of the company. The term is still today onboard its newer vessels. The company has also created the White Star Academy, an in-house programme for preparing new crew members for the service standards expected on Cunard ships.

By 2001, Carnival was the largest cruise company, followed by Royal Caribbean and P&amp;O Princess Cruises, which had recently separated from its parent, P&amp;O. When Royal Caribbean and P&amp;O Princess agreed to merge, Carnival countered with a hostile takeover bid for P&amp;O Princess. Carnival rejected the idea of selling Cunard to resolve antitrust issues with the acquisition. European and US regulators approved the merger without requiring Cunard&#x27;s sale. After the merger was completed, Carnival moved Cunard&#x27;s headquarters to the offices of Princess Cruises in Santa Clarita, California, so that administrative, financial and technology services could be combined.

Carnival House opened in Southampton in 2009, and executive control of Cunard Line transferred from Carnival Corporation in the United States, to Carnival UK, the primary operating company of Carnival plc. As the UK-listed holding company of the group, Carnival plc had executive control of all Carnival Group activities in the UK, with the headquarters of all UK-based brands, including Cunard, in offices at Carnival House.

In 2004, the 36-year-old &quot;QE2&quot; was replaced on the North Atlantic by the ocean liner RMS &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;. &quot;Caronia&quot; was sold and &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; continued to cruise until she was retired in 2008. In 2007 Cunard added &quot;Queen Victoria&quot;, a cruise ship of the Vista class originally designed for Holland America Line. To reinforce Cunard traditions, &quot;Queen Victoria&quot; has a small museum on board. Cunard commissioned a second Vista class cruise ship, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, in 2010.

In 2010, Cunard appointed its first female commander, Captain Inger Klein Olsen. In 2011, Cunard changed the vessel registry of all three of its ships in service to Hamilton, Bermuda, the first time in the 171-year history of the company that it had no ships registered in the United Kingdom. The captains of ships registered in Bermuda can marry couples at sea, whereas those of UK-registered ships cannot, and weddings at sea are a lucrative market.

On 25 May 2015, the three Cunard ships – &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and &quot;Queen Victoria&quot; – sailed up the Mersey into Liverpool to commemorate the 175th anniversary of Cunard. The ships performed manoeuvres, including 180-degree turns, as the Red Arrows performed a fly-past. Just over a year later &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; returned to Liverpool under Captain Olsen to take part in the celebrations of the centenary of the Cunard Building on 2 June 2016. 

In September 2017, Cunard announced a fourth ship was ordered for the fleet. It would be a modified hull platform of Holland America&#x27;s Pinnacle class &quot;Koningsdam&quot;. The ship was original supposed to be delivered in 2022, but would eventually be pushed back 2 years.

At the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, Cunard cut short three world-cruises, with the passengers being flown home.

The White Star Line flag is raised on all current Cunard ships and the &quot;Nomadic&quot; every 15 April in memory of the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster.

The new ship &quot;Queen Anne&quot; was delivered to Cunard on 19 April 2024, the first new ship for the line in over 14 years. She arrived in Southampton on 30 April 2024. The ship departed on her maiden cruise from Southampton to the Canary Islands on 3 May 2024, and she will be officially named in Liverpool in June.

==Fleet==
===Former fleet===
The Cunard line has operated numerous ships during its long history.

==Cunard Hotels==
After Trafalgar House bought the company in 1971, Cunard operated the former company&#x27;s existing hotels as Cunard-Trafalgar Hotels. In the 1980s, the chain was restyled as Cunard Hotels &amp; Resorts, before folding in 1995.

<doc id="95375" wikidata="Q475796" url="?curid=95375" title="National Security Strategy (United States)">
<text>The National Security Strategy (NSS) is a document prepared periodically by the executive branch of the United States that lists the national security concerns and how the administration plans to deal with them. The legal foundation for the document is spelled out in the Goldwater–Nichols Act. The document is purposely general in content, and its implementation relies on elaborating guidance provided in supporting documents such as the National Military Strategy.

==Purpose==

The stated intent of the Goldwater–Nichols legislation is broadly accepted as valid for effective political discourse on issues affecting the nation&#x27;s security—the Congress and the Executive need a common understanding of the strategic environment and the administration&#x27;s intent as a starting point for future dialogue. That said, however, it is understood that in the adversarial environment that prevails, this report can only provide a beginning point for the dialogue necessary to reach such a &quot;common&quot; understanding.

The requirement of producing this report along with the budget request leads to an iterative, interagency process involving high level meetings that helps to resolve internal differences in foreign policy agendas. However, &quot;this report was not to be a neutral planning document, as many academics and even some in uniform think it to be. Rather it was ... intended to serve five primary purposes.&quot;

# Communicate the Executive&#x27;s strategic vision to Congress, and thus legitimize its requests for resources.
# Communicate the Executive&#x27;s strategic vision to foreign constituencies, especially governments not on the US&#x27;s summit agenda.
# Communicate with select domestic audiences, such as political supporters seeking Presidential recognition of their issues, and those who hope to see a coherent and farsighted strategy they could support.
# Create internal consensus on foreign and defense policy within the executive branch.
# Contribute to the overall agenda of the President, both in terms of substance and messaging.

Where the incoming executive team has not formulated a national security strategy, such as an after an election in which foreign policy and defense were not important campaign issues, the process of writing the report can be of immense importance:
Few things educate new political appointees faster as to their own strategic sensings, or to the qualities and competencies of the &quot;permanent&quot; government they lead within executive bureaucracies, than to have to commit in writing to the President their plans for the future and how they can be integrated, coordinated and otherwise shared with other agencies and departments. The ability to forge consensus among these competing views on direction, priorities and pace, and getting &quot;on board&quot; important players three political levels down from the president is recognized as an invaluable, if not totally daunting, opportunity for a new administration.

==History==
===2002 NSS===
The National Security Strategy issued on September 17, 2002, contained the controversial Bush doctrine of pre-emptive war. It also contained the notion of military pre-eminence that was reflected in a 1992 Department of Defense paper, &quot;Defense Policy Guidance&quot;, prepared by two principal authors (Paul Wolfowitz and I. Lewis Libby) working under Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. The NSS 2002 repeated and re-emphasized efforts to provide foreign aid to countries moving towards Western-style democracy, with the &quot;ambitious and specific target&quot; of &quot;doubl[ing] the size of the world&#x27;s poorest economies within a decade.&quot;

The Bush doctrine reflected an effort to move from the Cold War doctrine of deterrence to one that could deal with terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda as well as nation-states such as Iraq or Iran.

The document also treated AIDS as a threat to national security, promising efforts to reduce its spread and devastating effects.
===2006 NSS===
Published in March 2006, the final Bush White House NSS said it was based on two &quot;pillars&quot;: &quot;promoting freedom, justice, and human dignity&quot; and &quot;leading a growing community of democracies.&quot;

===2010 NSS===
On May 26, 2010, President Barack Obama. issued a new Strategy which was called by United Nations ambassador Susan Rice a &quot;dramatic departure&quot; from its predecessor. The Strategy advocated increased engagement with Russia, China and India. The Strategy also identified nuclear non-proliferation and climate change as priorities, while noting that the United States&#x27;s security depended on reviving its economy. The drafters of the new Strategy made a conscious decision to remove terms such as &quot;Islamic radicalism&quot;, instead speaking of terrorism generally.

The 2010 NSS said that in order to defeat al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan, the United States needs to engage in a large amount of interagency cooperation and communication with the Muslim population in Afghanistan and throughout the world. The objective of the National Security Strategy is to create a stable situation for the world, including those countries struggling with insurgencies. &quot;The most effective long-term measure for conflict and resolution is the promotion of democracy and economic development.&quot; In order to promote democracy and economic development communication with the civilian population of the host-nation is essential. The Stability Operations Field Manual states that success depends on a U.S. ability to build local institutions and in the establishment of a legitimate permanent government, which builds trust between the citizens and the counterinsurgency personnel.&quot; The National Security Strategy establishes the interagency coordination in order to conduct useful public diplomacy to secure the population in the countries of Afghanistan and Iraq.

===2015 NSS===
On February 6, 2015, Obama issued a new NSS to provide &quot;a vision and strategy for advancing the nation&#x27;s interests, universal values, and a rules-based international order through strong and sustainable American leadership.&quot;

===2017 NSS===
The primary author of the 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS) was Nadia Schadlow, then-deputy national security adviser. Her work on the document and the inter-agency process that preceded it were well-received by foreign policy experts across the political spectrum. Delivered by President Donald Trump on December 18, 2017, the new document named China and Russia as &quot;revisionist powers&quot; while removing &quot;climate change&quot; as a national threat. It also characterized the world as a competitive arena rather than a &quot;community of nations&quot; or &quot;international community&quot; as previous documents had. NSS-2017 represents a break with past foreign policy doctrine. Brad Patty, an author for the conservative think tank Security Studies Group writes that, &quot;My guess is that members of the Foreign Policy elite will encounter these first pages as a kind of boilerplate, even trite. Notice, though, that those two pages lead directly to a third page that repudiates the whole living body of American foreign policy thought.&quot;

About a year later, Schadlow would comment that the NSS had &quot;achieved the state of mattering&quot;.

===2021 NSS===

In March 2021, President Joe Biden published the 2021 Interim National Security Strategy (NSS), which recommitted the United States to the NATO alliance and outlined the country&#x27;s global priorities, concluding that the United States &quot;must demonstrate that democracies can still deliver for our people. It will not happen by accident – we have to defend our democracy, strengthen it and renew it..&quot;

===2022 NSS===

On October 12, 2022, the Biden Administration sent its classified National Security Strategy to Congress. According to an unclassified fact sheet released to the public, the strategy said the U.S. faced two strategic challenges: a post-cold war competition between superpowers and transnational challenges that range from climate change to global health issues. The document said that “the most pressing strategic challenge facing our vision is from powers that layer authoritarian governance with a revisionist foreign policy,” singling out China and Russia as presenting particular but different challenges. 

The 2022 National Security Strategy is organized around three points:

# Invest ambitiously and rapidly in the sources of our national strength.
# Mobilize the broadest coalition of nations to enhance our collective influence.
# Shape the rules of the road of the 21st century economy, from technology, to cyber to trade and economics.

<text>The London Borough of Hillingdon () is a London borough in Greater London, England. It forms part of outer London and West London, being the westernmost London borough. It was formed in 1965 from the districts of Hayes and Harlington, Ruislip-Northwood, Uxbridge, and Yiewsley and West Drayton. The borough includes most of Heathrow Airport and Brunel University, and is the second largest of the 32 London boroughs by area.

The main towns in the borough are Hayes, Ruislip, Northwood, West Drayton and Uxbridge. Hillingdon is the second least densely populated of the London boroughs, due to a combination of rural land in the north, RAF Northolt Aerodrome, and Heathrow Airport.

==History==
The borough was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, covering the combined area of the former Municipal Borough of Uxbridge, Hayes and Harlington Urban District, Ruislip-Northwood Urban District and Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District. The area was transferred from Middlesex to Greater London to become one of the 32 London Boroughs. The councils involved were initially unable to decide upon a name, with Keith Joseph suggesting &quot;Uxbridge&quot; in October 1963, later revised to Hillingdon.

==Governance==
The local authority is Hillingdon Council, based at Hillingdon Civic Centre in Uxbridge.

The borough is divided into 21 wards: 
===Greater London representation===
Since 2000, for elections to the London Assembly, the borough forms part of the Ealing and Hillingdon constituency. The Conservative candidate Richard Barnes won the 2000, 2004 and 2008 elections, and since the 2012 election the Labour candidate Onkar Sahota has served as the Ealing and Hillingdon London Assembly member. At the same election in 2012 Conservative candidate Boris Johnson won the largest share of Hillingdon&#x27;s votes, becoming elected Mayor of London for a second term.

==Demographics==
===Population===
From 2001 to 2011 the borough&#x27;s population grew by 11.5% (4.4% above the England and Wales mean of 7.1%). By comparison Merton and Bromley grew by 4.5% and Tower Hamlets grew by 26.4%. The number of households increased from 2001 to 2011 by 3.3%, and the average number of people per household was 2.7.

===Ethnicity===
37.1% of the borough&#x27;s population identified themselves as White British in the 2021 census. In the south-east of the borough, in particular Hayes, there is a large population of South Asian residents.

The wards where Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Residents comprise the largest racial groups are:
*Barnhill (partly covering eastern Hayes, south of Yeading),
*Pinkwell (mostly the area around the railway station in southern Hayes),
*Townfield (Part of eastern Hayes and west of Southall),
*Yeading (Eastern Hayes)

Whites as a whole form 48.2% of the borough, Asian residents 33.3%, and Black residents 7.8%. In addition, the most common main language, English (77.9%), is followed by Punjabi (4.7%), Polish (1.7%), Tamil (1.6%) and Urdu (1.1%).

==Parks and recreation==
The borough maintains over 200 green spaces, totalling around . As much of the area is within the Metropolitan Green Belt it was, in 2008, one of the least densely populated of all the London boroughs; open spaces range in size from the Colne Valley Regional Park by the River Colne in the north of the borough, to smaller gardens and parks such as the Norman Leddy Memorial Gardens and Lake Farm Country Park in the south of the borough.

Council leader Raymond Puddifoot had given a promise that green-belt land in Hillingdon would be safe on his watch: &#x27;I can give a categoric assurance that under this administration we will never see a threat to the green belt.&#x27; In August 2012, however, Mr Puddifoot announced plans to build on green-belt (and longtime common land) site Lake Farm in the south of the borough. Dismissing the discontent of residents in the south of the borough, the Conservative majority of the council&#x27;s planning committee peremptorily rubber-stamped the plans in March 2013.

Harmondsworth Moor, a park owned by the borough, is administered by British Airways on behalf of the borough. After British Airways planned to create a new headquarters in 1992, the airline agreed to convert a former landfill site into Harmondsworth Moor.

The Grand Union Canal passes through Hayes, Yiewsley, Cowley and Uxbridge in the borough. Ruislip Lido was built as a feeder reservoir for the canal, but was eventually disconnected and changed to become a recreational lido. Two Sites of Special Scientific Interest next to the canal, Frays Farm Meadows and Denham Lock Wood, are managed by the London Wildlife Trust.

The borough also operates children&#x27;s centres, recreational areas for children of under five years of age and their families. The centres include: Barra Hall, Belmore, Cherry Lane, Colham Manor, Cornerstone, Cowley St. Laurence, Harefield, Hillside, McMillan Early Childhood Centre, Nestles Avenue, Oak Farm, and Uxbridge College (Hayes Campus).

The borough owns four theatres: the Beck Theatre in Hayes (which is operated on behalf of the borough by Trafalgar Entertainment), the Compass Theatre in Ickenham, the Winston Churchill Theatre and Hall (part of the Manor Farm site) and the Open Air Theatre in Barra Hall Park in Hayes.

===Sport and leisure===
The borough has seven Non-League football clubs:
*A.F.C. Hayes, who play at Farm Park, Hayes.
*Harefield United F.C., who play at Preston Park, Harefield.
*Hayes &amp; Yeading United F.C., who play at Skyex Community Stadium, Hayes.

* Queensmead Sailing Club
* Hillingdon Rowing Club
* Hillingdon Junior Canoe Club
* Harrow Angling Club

==Economy==
===Economic history===

The south&#x27;s former strong connection with industry has diminished since the 1980s to be replaced by a preponderantly residential suburban population; the north has remained a consistently residential suburban area, although with significant swathes of rural land. The borough&#x27;s residential areas expanded with the extension of the Metropolitan Railway from Harrow on the Hill to Uxbridge in the early 20th century and the gradual establishment of stops along the line, becoming known as &quot;Metro-land&quot;.

===Contemporary economy===
Hillingdon has a large economy by national standards, ranked 14th out of 408 local area districts in Britain, and ranked fifth out of the London boroughs.

British Airways is headquartered in Waterside, Harmondsworth, in Hillingdon. The building officially opened in 1998. Prior to the opening of Waterside, the airline&#x27;s head office was the Speedbird House at London Heathrow Airport. An office of American Airlines is located at the Orient House (HAA3) within Waterside.

In 2007 Cadbury Schweppes announced it would be moving to Uxbridge from Mayfair to cut costs. The company later split and Cadbury plc moved to its new head office in Cadbury House in the Uxbridge Business Park in June 2008.

Guoman Hotel Management (UK) Limited has its head office in the Thistle London Heathrow in West Drayton.

British Midland International had its training centre in Stockley Close, West Drayton. Hellenic Imperial Airways had its United Kingdom offices in the Axis House in Harlington. China Airlines had its UK office in the Hyde Park Hayes 3 (HPH3) in Hayes.

One of the predecessor organisations of British Airways, British Overseas Airways Corporation, had its head office in Speedbird House. The other predecessor, British European Airways, had its headquarters in South Ruislip, as did BEA Helicopters. During its existence the airline British Eagle had its head office on the grounds of Heathrow Airport.

A 2017 study by Trust for London and New Policy Institute found that there is a 22% poverty rate in Hillingdon, slightly below the London-wide figure of 27%. It also found that 24% of Hillingdon&#x27;s local employees are low-paid, narrowly above the London average of 21%.

===Government facilities===

London Heathrow Airport is located in the borough and is one of the busiest airports in the world. It was originally used by the Royal Air Force.
The British Government&#x27;s UK Visas and Immigration has two immigration removal centres: Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centre and Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre in Harmondsworth.

The borough includes RAF Northolt and the former sites of RAF Eastcote, RAF South Ruislip, RAF West Drayton, RAF Ruislip 4MU, RAF West Ruislip and RAF Uxbridge.

==Education==
The borough maintains 17 libraries: Charville, Eastcote, Harefield, Harlington, Hayes End, Hayes, Ickenham, Manor Farm, Northwood Hills, Northwood, Oak Farm, Ruislip Manor, South Ruislip, Uxbridge, West Drayton, Yeading, and Yiewsley.

Hillingdon has undertaken the largest school expansion programme in London, ensuring that all children within the borough can go to a school close to where they live.

In May 2011, Hillingdon Council received the Library Innovation of the Year award at the 2011 Bookseller Industry Awards.

Also within the borough are Brunel University and Uxbridge College&#x27;s Uxbridge and Hayes campuses, as well as the Douay Martyrs Catholic Secondary School and St Bernadette Catholic Primary School.

The London Borough of Hillingdon also offers music lessons as part of the Hillingdon Music Service.

==Transport==

National Rail and London Underground stations in the borough are:
*Eastcote tube station
*Hatton Cross tube station
*Hayes and Harlington railway station
*Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3 railway station
*Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3 tube station

The Royal Air Force station RAF Northolt is situated in South Ruislip near the A40 and the tube station. Most early RAF airfields were named after the nearest railway station; in this case Northolt Junction, the original name of South Ruislip station. The station has been redeveloped in recent years to house a number of additional military capabilities besides the RAF operations, and is popular with business people and politicians for private flights.

==Town twinning==
Hillingdon is twinned with:
*Mantes-la-Jolie, France
*Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany

The borough has been twinned with the French town of Mantes-la-Jolie and the German town of Schleswig since the Hayes &amp; Harlington Urban District created the link in 1958. The twinning programme was reviewed in 2011 and it was suggested that the link with Schleswig be ended owing to a lack of contact between the towns. In December 2011, the borough decided instead to end the link with a second German town, Emden, citing administrative problems.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms for the London Borough of Hillingdon was granted on 22 March 1965. Between 1973 and 1978, the borough&#x27;s civic centre was built in Uxbridge.

<text>The London Borough of Newham () is a London borough created in 1965 by the London Government Act 1963. It covers an area previously administered by the Essex county boroughs of West Ham and East Ham, authorities that were both abolished by the same act. The name Newham reflects its creation and combines the compass points of the old borough names. Situated in the Inner London part of East London, Newham has a population of 387,576, which is the fourth highest of the London boroughs and also makes it the 26th most populous district in England. The local authority is Newham London Borough Council.

It is east of the City of London, north of the River Thames (the Woolwich Ferry and Woolwich foot tunnel providing the only crossings to the south), bounded by the River Lea to its west and the North Circular Road to its east. Newham was one of the six host boroughs for the 2012 Summer Olympics and contains most of the Olympic Park including the London Stadium, and also contains the London City Airport. Major districts include East Ham, West Ham, Stratford, Plaistow, Forest Gate, Beckton and Canning Town.

==History==
The borough was formed on 1 April 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, as a borough of the newly formed Greater London. It broadly covered the areas of the county borough of East Ham and the county borough of West Ham that were abolished by the same act.
These in turn were successors to the ancient civil and ecclesiastical parishes of East Ham and West Ham. Green Street and Boundary Road mark the former boundary between the two.

North Woolwich also became part of the borough (previously part of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich, the majority of which lay south of the River Thames), as did a small area around Gallions Reach west of the River Roding which had previously been part of the Municipal Borough of Barking. East Ham, West Ham and Barking had all historically been part of the county of Essex, whilst Woolwich had been part of Kent prior to becoming part of the County of London in 1889. &quot;Newham&quot; was devised for the borough as an entirely new name.

===Manor of Ham===
The area of the modern borough was at one time occupied by a manor (an estate or landholding with certain legal responsibilities) called &#x27;Ham&#x27;. The name comes from Old English &#x27;hamm&#x27; and means &#x27;a dry area of land between rivers or marshland&#x27;, referring to the location of the settlement within boundaries formed by the rivers Lea, Thames and Roding and their marshes.

The first known written use of the term, as &#x27;Hamme&#x27;, is in an Anglo-Saxon charter of 958, in which King Edgar granted the area to Ealdorman Athelstan. The territory was undivided at that time. A subsequent charter of 1037 describes a transfer of land which has been identified with East Ham, indicating that the division of the territory occurred between 958 and 1037.

The Domesday Book shows landholdings divided further, and by the end of the 12th century these manors were being served, singly or in groups of manors, by the familiar ancient parishes of West Ham, East Ham and Little Ilford (now also known as Manor Park), with some areas by the Roding a part of Barking, and the area now known as North Woolwich attached to Woolwich. The earliest recorded use of the name West Ham, &quot;Westhamma&quot;, comes in 1186, and East Ham, &quot;Estham&quot;, is recorded in 1204.

The boundary between West and East Ham was drawn from the now lost Hamfrith Waste and Hamfrith Wood in the north (then the southernmost parts of Epping Forest which extended as far south as the Romford Road at that time), along Green Street down to the small, also lost, natural harbour known as Ham Creek. Ham Creek was filled-in in the nineteenth century, but the small residual head of the creek still formed the boundary between the two areas into the late 20th century, when what remained was also filled in.

The formation of the modern borough in 1965 saw the merger of West and East Ham, together with North Woolwich and Barking west of the River Roding. Little Ilford had become part of East Ham as part of earlier local government reorganisations.

===Medieval period===
The prosperity of the area increased due to the construction of Bow Bridge, the only bridge over the Lea, and the creation of Stratford Langthorne Abbey.

==Governance==

The local authority is Newham Council, which meets at Newham Town Hall in East Ham and has its main offices at 1000 Dockside Road, overlooking the Royal Albert Dock. Since 2002 the council has been led by a directly elected Mayor of Newham.

===Greater London representation===
Since 2000, for elections to the London Assembly, the borough forms part of the City and East constituency.

==Demography==
===Population figures===

Newham has, after Barnet and Croydon, the third highest population of the London boroughs, with a population numbering 382,984 as of 2021. Despite growing since the 1980s, it is still drastically lower than its pre-war peak. In the period between 1951 and 1981, Newham&#x27;s population shrunk by 28.87% owing to factors such as the war bombings and the increasingly high unemployment. The redevelopment of the Docklands as well as development related to the 2012 Olympics have contributed to reversing its declining trend.

===Ethnicities===

Newham has the youngest overall population and one of the lowest White British populations in the country according to the 2011 UK Census. The borough has the second-highest percentage of Muslims in the UK, after the neighbouring London Borough of Tower Hamlets, at 32%. A 2017 report from Trust for London and the New Policy Institute found that 36% of local employees in Newham are in low paid work; the highest percentage of any London borough. Newham also has a 37% poverty rate, which is the second-highest rate in London.

Newham is very ethnically diverse. When using Simpson&#x27;s Diversity Index on 10 aggregated ethnic groups, the 2001 UK Census identified Newham as the most ethnically diverse district in England and Wales, with 9 wards in the top 15. However, when using the 16 ethnic categories in the Census so that White Irish and White Other ethnic minorities are also included in the analysis, Newham becomes the second-most ethnically diverse borough with six out of the top 15 wards, behind Brent with 7 out of the top 15 wards.

Newham has the lowest percentage of both total White and White British residents of all of London&#x27;s boroughs. The joint-lowest wards with White British population are Green Street East and Green Street West, each having 4.8% – the third-lowest behind Southall Broadway and Southall Green in Ealing. East Ham North follows closely, at 4.9%.

As of the 2021 UK census, people of &quot;Bangladeshi&quot; ethnicity are the largest single group in the borough at 15.9%. &quot;White British&quot; are the second largest group at 14.8%, with &quot;White Other&quot; third largest at 14.6%, &quot;African&quot; fourth largest at 11.6%, &quot;Indian&quot; next largest at 11% and then &quot;Pakistani&quot; at 8.9%. Newham has had a large Asian community for many decades; more than half of Newham&#x27;s Upton and Kensington wards were of ethnic minority origin in 1981. The nationality to increase the most in number since 1991 is the Bangladeshi community. Newham has the largest total population of Asian origin in London; it is notably a borough with high populations of all three largest British Asian nationalities, having the 5th highest Indian population in London and the 2nd highest each for both Pakistani and Bangladeshi.

Newham has 1,340 residents who were born in Ukraine, the highest population of Ukrainians in the UK.
=== Health ===
In 2018, Newham had the lowest life expectancy and the highest rate of heart disease of all London boroughs together with the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

In 2019, the BBC reported that Newham had the highest rate of tuberculosis in the UK at 107 per population, which was higher than Rwanda (69) and Iraq (45) according to WHO figures from 2013. More than 80% of TB cases in London occur in people born abroad. The UK average was 13.

===Religion===

The following table shows the religious identity of residents residing in Newham according to the 2001, 2011 and the 2021 censuses.

=== Transgender identity ===
The 2021 census showed that 1.5% of adults in Newham identified as transgender, derived from the Census question, &quot;Is the gender you identify with the same as your sex registered at birth?&quot;. This gave Newham the highest proportion of transgender adults with the Borough of Brent coming second (at 1.3%). The overall proportion in England and Wales was 0.5% with Brighton, an area well known for its LGBT communities, 1%. However, Prof Michael Biggs of Oxford University showed there was a correlation between the proportion of transgender people in these areas and the proportion for whom English was not their first language (35% in Newham and 34% in Brent, compared to 9% nationally), suggesting the question was not fully understood by some. Prof Biggs described the figures as &quot;irredeemably flawed&quot;. In September 2024, Mary Gregory, a deputy director at the ONS said some people may have misunderstood the question, saying there was &quot;potential bias&quot; in how the question was answered &quot;by those who responded that they had lower levels of English proficiency, some of whom may have mistakenly given an answer suggesting they were trans&quot;. As a result, the ONS downgraded the data from &quot;accredited official statistics&quot; to &quot;official statistics in development&quot; to reflect the possible flaws.

==Education==

A 2017 report by Trust for London and the New Policy Institute finds that the GCSE attainment gap between advantaged and disadvantaged pupils in Newham is the 4th best out of 32 London boroughs.

===Schools and colleges===
The Borough is the education authority for the district providing education in a mix of Foundation, community and voluntary aided schools. The borough also owns and operates Debden House, a residential adult education college in Loughton, Essex, and is home to the Rosetta Art Centre, a dedicated visual art organisation which delivers courses at its base in Stratford and produces participatory art projects, programmes and initiatives. The Essex Primary School in Sheridan Road with over 900 pupils is one of the biggest primary schools in London.

===Universities===
The University of East London has two campuses in Newham:
*the Stratford Campus, at Stratford
*the Docklands Campus, next to the regenerated Royal Albert Dock

Birkbeck Stratford is a collaboration between Birkbeck, University of London and UEL to increase participation in adult learning. This is based on the UEL/Birkbeck shared campus, USS (University Square Stratford), in the centre of Stratford.

The University of East London had formed a partnership with the United States Olympic Committee which resulted in the United States Olympic Team using University of East London campuses as training bases during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

==Transport==
Since the 1980s, public transport in Newham has undergone many upgrades and improvements are still continuing to this day.

The Docklands Light Railway (DLR) first opened in 1987, and was extended from Tower Hamlets through to Beckton in 1994. The network has undergone many extensions since, including to serve London City Airport, as well as Stratford International station in 2011 after its High Speed 1 link opened in late 2009. The Jubilee Line Extension was completed in 1999, including new or improved stations at Canning Town, West Ham and Stratford. The DLR network compensates for Newham&#x27;s lack of tube stations, of which there are only 6, in comparison with other London boroughs. The Crossrail scheme - opening as the Elizabeth line in 2022 - also delivered improved rail connections to several stations as it heads through the borough on an east west axis. Of the 28 stations in Newham, only 4 stations lack step free access - thanks to the recent age of many of the stations in the borough.

As a result of all the recent developments, the borough contains one of only two airports located within the Greater London boundary and currently the only railway station outside of central London that is served by high speed rail.

The name &quot;Plaistow&quot; is believed by some to come from Sir Hugh de Plaiz or Plaitz who, in 1065, married Philippa de Montfitchet, of the Mountfitchet Castle family, who owned the district. It is she who is reputed to have named it the Manor of Plaiz.

However, in his book &quot;What&#x27;s in a Name?&quot;, first published in 1977, author Cyril M. Harris states that c. 1200 Plaistow was recorded as Plagestoue, derived from the Old English , meaning &#x27;sport&#x27; or &#x27;playing&#x27;, and &#x27;place&#x27;. It was a place where miracle plays were performed so it was a &#x27;playing place&#x27;. While the book concentrates on the names of London railway stations, Harris could have confused Plaistow in Essex (and later London) with the Plaistow near Crich in Derbyshire, which is recorded as Plagestoue in the &quot;Darley Charters&quot; of 1200. Nevertheless, the derivation from  + could apply equally to all places named Plaistow, Plaister, etc.

Plaistow in Essex is reported as appearing as Playstowe in the county&#x27;s &quot;Patent Rolls&quot; of 1414. This is also quoted by James Kemble, another who cites the derivation from  + – a &#x27;place for playing&#x27;.

The book &quot;Fifty Years a Borough, 1886-1936, The Story of West Ham&quot;, compiled by Donald McDougall on behalf of West Ham County Borough Council, leans towards the derivation from Hugh de Plaiz, as Lord of the Manor, and that Plaistow was the Stow or village of the de Plaiz family.

==History==
===Medieval and Tudor===
Hugh de Balun was a property-owner in the area in the 12th century and belonged to the same family as Hamelin de Balun. Known as &quot;Balostret&quot; in the 1371 &quot;Calendar of Inquisitions Miscellaneous&quot;, Balaam Street is one of the oldest roads in Plaistow and is probably named after de Balun, though some argue its namesake is in fact a Walter Balame.

In 1353, Sir Richard de Playz gave the manor of Plaistow to the abbot of Stratford-Langthorne. When this abbey was dissolved the manor was appropriated by the Crown, and granted to Sir Roger Cholmeley in 1553.

===18th century===
Daniel Defoe&#x27;s 1724 work, &quot;Tour of the Eastern Counties&quot; (part of his &quot;A Tour Thro’ the Whole Island of Great Britain&quot;), mentions Plaistow as a town in which there had been much new building as well as repairs to existing houses since the Glorious Revolution. Plaistow is connected with the legend of notorious highwayman Dick Turpin (born 1705; executed 1739). Several stories state that among Turpin’s first crimes was the theft of two oxen from his employer, a Mr Giles of Plaistow, in 1730. Turpin is alleged to also have run a smuggling gang which operated between Plaistow and Southend.
In Aaron Hill&#x27;s time there (1738–1750) Plaistow was a rural village described as a day&#x27;s coach journey from Westminster, despite it being a distance of only some . The Black Lion public house in the High Street is one of the oldest landmarks in Plaistow and is reputed to date back to at least 1742.

===19th century===
Newly-appointed as pastor to a Congregationalist church in Plaistow, John Curwen opened the Plaistow Public School in 1844. That year also saw Plaistow become a chapelry as well as an Anglican parish in its own right, split off from All Saints Church, West Ham; Plaistow&#x27;s chapel of ease St Mary&#x27;s became the new parish&#x27;s church. Curwen also started a printing business in Plaistow in 1863.

In the 1870s, John Marius Wilson described it in his &quot;Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales&quot; as a village, a chapelry and a ward in the Parish of West Ham in Essex. The population of the chapelry was recorded as 11,214 in 1861. James Thorne, in his 1876 work &quot;Handbook to the Environs of London&quot;, mentions Plaistow, Essex, as a village and ecclesiastical district of West Ham parish with a population of 6,699. Thorne recounts the changes to the old village of Plaistow, with the gentry, merchants and others of renown having gone and the occupations of the residents changed from agricultural and pastoral to manufacturing. In 1886 Plaistow became part of the new County Borough of West Ham.

The area gained several new Anglican churches in the second half of the 19th century – St Philip&#x27;s in 1860, St Andrew&#x27;s in 1868, St Katherine&#x27;s in 1891, St Martin&#x27;s in 1894 and St Thomas&#x27;s in 1898. Only St Martin&#x27;s and St Andrew&#x27;s survive; St Andrew&#x27;s is mentioned in Thorne&#x27;s work and, like its adjoining vicarage (1871), is a grade II listed building. John Curwen&#x27;s son, John Spencer Curwen (who founded the Stratford &amp; East London Music Festival – the oldest English music festival – in 1882), published a paper called &quot;“Old Plaistow”&quot; in 1891 describing houses of the area.

===1900–1995===
It was not until 1905 that Plaistow was connected to the telephone network, though it became its own UK Parliamentary constituency in 1918, consisting of the Plaistow and Hudsons wards of the County Borough of West Ham, plus part of the Canning Town ward. That constituency was subsumed into the West Ham constituency in 1950.

The Memorial Baptist Church was built in 1921 as a monument to the dead of the First World War. Opened in 1922, it is now a grade II listed building. Its ten Memorial Bells bear the names of more than 150 men who died in the fighting (the largest number of names on any set of bells in the world). The bells were cleaned and restored using a National Heritage Lottery grant between February and August 2011 as part of a larger restoration project.
In 1921, the YMCA opened Greengate House on Greengate Street. Now a grade II listed building, it was once used as an Art college by the University of East London and students included Jake and Dinos Chapman. In 2010 the building was demolished but the grand and ornate façade was retained and modernised and a new block of flats built behind it.

The area was heavily damaged during the Blitz in the Second World War. The Plaistow North area is largely made up of a local authority housing estate constructed in the 1960s on a bomb-damaged site. The estate used to include five 14-storey 1960s tower blocks but much has changed and the area has undergone a major redevelopment programme. The Black Lion public house was frequented by West Ham United football players especially such as Bobby Moore in the 1960s and &#x27;70s with several West Ham footballers spotted in the area since.

In 1965 Plaistow became part of the new London Borough of Newham, formed when West Ham joined with the County Borough of East Ham and small parts of Barking and Woolwich.

===1995–present===
Just before the end of the 1990s a £92 million regeneration programme known as the Forest Gate and Plaistow SRB5 got under way, with the aim of renewing and revitalising neighbourhoods, creating jobs, building new homes and improving many existing ones. West Ham and Plaistow New Deal for Communities (&quot;NDC&quot;), part of a government programme designed to tackle social exclusion, community safety, unemployment and low educational attainment in areas of severe need throughout the country, was awarded £54.6 million to bring about improvements to the local area over a 10-year period to 2010, with the intention of improving the quality of life and providing more opportunities for residents in the West Ham and Plaistow area.

In March 2010, the NDC set up Newham New Deal Partnership (&quot;Newham NDP&quot;), a Not-for-Profit organisation, to continue providing community benefit to the NDC area and beyond, and continue the work carried out over the 10 years of the NDC Programme. Newham NDP works in partnership with the East London Business Alliance, East Thames Group, London Borough of Newham and One Housing Group to provide community benefits to the area either directly or in partnership with other stakeholders. In March 2011 the Memorial Community Church was awarded money by the Big Lottery Fund Reaching Communities programme, to improve community facilities there.

On 10 December 2012, Plaistow South was named as one of fifty areas of England to share in a Big Lottery Scheme grant of £200 million. Plaistow South received £1 million to fund locally-designed projects to improve the area. In January 2013, councillors approved a new housing development of both private and affordable homes on the site of the old Plaistow Hospital. Construction began in March 2013 with completion of Phase 1 in 2015 and Phase 2 in 2016.

==Amenities==
Places of interest in the area include the Plaistow Park (known as Balaam Street Recreation Ground from its opening in 1894 to its renaming in 1999), and the Memorial Park which merges into the East London Cemetery. There are several small parks in the area, with the large West Ham Park north.

In Plaistow are Newham Leisure Centre, and Newham University Hospital. Newham Sixth Form College&#x27;s main campus is in the south-east, near the hospital.

The Terence McMillan Stadium, named for the first mayor of Newham, Terence McMillan, who occupied the position 1965 to 1966, is located in Plaistow, close to the hospital and the college. It is the former home of the Newham and Essex Beagles track and field athletics club and part of the Newham Leisure Centre. East End Road Runners is a running club based at the Newham Leisure Centre and was the recipient of England Athletics&#x27; award for London Development Club of the Year in 2011. Non-league football teams Athletic Newham (formerly Lopes Tavares) and Fire United Christian play at the Terence McMillan Stadium, which also became the home ground of Clapton, rivals of Athletic Newham in the Essex Senior League, in 2020.

The West Ham Boys&#x27; Amateur Boxing Club is located at the rear of the Black Lion public house in High Street.

The 59 Club, a charitable motorcycle club, is based in Plaistow and located in the Swift Centre in Barking Road.

==Education==
Nathan Kemp, assistant headteacher at Tollgate Primary School in Plaistow, won Teacher of the Year in the 2012 annual national Teaching Awards, the first ever overall Teacher of the Year instead of there being separate awards for primary and secondary schools.

Michael Patient of Tollgate was one of the winners of a Pearson teaching award in 2014, winning a silver award for outstanding new teacher of the year.

==Popular culture==
The location for the video shoot of &quot;(Keep Feeling) Fascination&quot; by the Human League was a house, painted entirely in orange and surrounding terraced streets at the corner of First Avenue and Third Avenue in Plaistow. The area has since been redeveloped.

&quot;Plaistow Patricia&quot; is a song from the highly acclaimed album &quot;New Boots and Panties!!&quot; by Ian Dury and the Blockheads released in 1977.

==Radio==
&quot;Voice of Africa Radio&quot; (VOAR) was a multilanguage internet and local radio station broadcasting from Plaistow. It was set up on 1 January 2000 and began as an unlicensed broadcaster, not obtaining a broadcast licence until 16 February 2006. It was the first licensed African radio station in the UK but had its licence revoked by Ofcom on 4 March 2016 for persistent failure to broadcast.

<text>Cenani–Lenz syndactylism, also known as Cenani–Lenz syndrome or Cenani–syndactylism, is an autosomal recessive congenital malformation syndrome involving both upper and lower extremities.

==Presentation==
It is characterized by a nearly symmetrical presence of a spoon hand (classical type) or, more frequently, an oligodactylous hand. Individuals with this syndrome present the following symptoms: carpal, metacarpal and digital synostoses, disorganization of carpal bones, numeric reduction of digital rays and toe syndactyly. Additionally, other symptoms may include radioulnar synostosis, brachymesomelia, radius head dislocation, metatarsal synostoses and numeric reduction of rays.

==Cause==

Cenani–Lenz syndactylism is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.

In a test of the theory that the locus associated with the disorder was at 15q13-q14, FMN1 and GREM1 were eliminated as candidates.
It is associated with &quot;LRP4&quot;.
==Diagnosis==
==Treatment==
==Eponym==
The syndrome is named after Turkish (Asim Cenani) and German (Widukind Lenz) medical geneticists.

<text>Hayes is a town in west London. Historically situated within the county of Middlesex, it is now part of the London Borough of Hillingdon. The town&#x27;s population, including its localities Hayes End, Harlington and Yeading, was recorded in the 2021 census as 93,928. It is situated west of Charing Cross, or east of Slough. Hayes is served by the Great Western Main Line, and Hayes &amp; Harlington railway station is on the Elizabeth line. The Grand Union Canal flows through the town centre.

Hayes has a long history. The area appears in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; (1086). Landmarks in the area include the Grade II* listed Parish Church, St Mary&#x27;s – the central portion of the church survives from the twelfth century and it remains in use (the church dates back to 830 A.D.) – and Grade-II-listed Barra Hall, the Town Hall from 1924 to 1979.

Hayes is known as the erstwhile home of EMI. The words &quot;Hayes, Middlesex&quot; appear on the reverse of The Beatles&#x27; albums, which were manufactured at the town&#x27;s Old Vinyl Factory. The town centre&#x27;s &quot;gold disc&quot; installation marks the fiftieth anniversary on 1 June 2017 of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album, manufactured in Hayes in 1967. Nearby London Heathrow Airport is the largest single provider of employment.

Notable historical residents include the early modern &quot;father of English music&quot;, William Byrd, and a pre-eminent figure of twentieth-century English literature, George Orwell.

==Etymology==
The place-name &quot;Hayes&quot; comes from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Hǣs&quot; or &quot;Hǣse&quot;: &quot;(land overgrown with) brushwood&quot;. In the Domesday book (1086), it is spelt Hesa. The town&#x27;s name is spelt &quot;Hessee&quot; in a 1628 entry in an Inquisition post mortem held at The National Archives.

==History==
Hayes is formed of what originally were five separate villages: Botwell, Hayes Town, Hayes End, Wood End and Yeading. The name &quot;Hayes Town&quot; has come to be applied to the area around Station Road between Coldharbour Lane and Hayes &amp; Harlington railway station, but this was historically the hamlet called Botwell. The original Hayes Town was the area to the east of St Mary&#x27;s Church, centred around Church Road, Hemmen Lane and Freeman&#x27;s Lane.

A 2007 archaeological study looks back to earliest times. It describes finds such as flint tools dating to the Paleolithic period (500,000 BC - 10,000 BC) at the sites of Botwell, EMI Company works, and Colbrook Avenue (near Dawley Road) [4.1.2]; more finds dating to the Mesolithic period (10,000 BC - 4,000 BC) at the site of Lake Farm Country Park [4.1.3]. The site of Wyre Grove (off North Hyde Road) produced finds including pottery from the Bronze Age (2,400 BC - 700 BC), Iron Age (700 BC - AD 43), Romano-British period (AD 43 - 410) and early Anglo-Saxon period (AD 410 - 1066) [4.1.6-11]. The report cites an 831 grant as evidence that the Botwell area has existed as a settlement since Anglo-Saxon times [4.1.12].

For some 700 years up to 1546, Hayes formed part of the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s estates, ostensibly owing to grants from the Mercian royal family. In that year, the then-Archbishop Thomas Cranmer was forced to surrender his land to King Henry VIII, who subsequently granted the estate to Edward North, 1st Baron North. The area changed hands several times thereafter, but by the eighteenth century, two family-names had established themselves as prominent and long-time landowners: Minet) and Shackle.

John Wesley (1703–1791) and Charles Wesley (1707–1788), founders of the evangelical Methodist movement, preached in Hayes on at least ten occasions between 1748 and 1753. The Salvation Army – founded in 1865 in London by William Booth – registered a barracks in Hayes between 1887 and 1896; their hall, or &quot;citadel&quot;, at 71 Coldharbour Lane was registered in 1927. The Hayes division served the local community for just short of a century, and in years gone by their own Salvation Army brass band performed around the town&#x27;s streets.) In 2024, the Salvation Army hall closed and was put up for sale.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Hayes was home to several private boarding schools catering for wealthy families. The former Manor House on Church Road was by the 1820s a boys&#x27; school called Radnor House Academy (a.k.a. Manor House Academy); Grove Cottage, Wood End, a school for young men, opened in the 1830s; Belle House School for Boys opened on Botwell Lane in the 1840s (it is now St Mary&#x27;s Convent); in the first half of the 19th century, the Wood End House School for Young Ladies stood on the site of what is now the Norman Leddy Memorial Gardens; the former Magdalen Hall on Hayes End Road was also a 19th-century private School for Young Ladies.

Wood End House (before 1848, the site of the Wood End House School for Young Ladies) was used – from 1848 to c. 1905 – as an asylum. Notable psychiatrist John Conolly (1794–1866) was one of its licensed proprietors, between 1848 and 1866. The building was demolished in 1961.

Until the end of the nineteenth century, Hayes&#x27;s key areas of work were agriculture and brickmaking. The Second Industrial Revolution brought change in the late nineteenth century, up to World War I. The town&#x27;s location on the Grand Junction Canal (later called the Grand Union) and the Great Western Railway – Hayes &amp; Harlington railway station had opened in 1868 – made it well-placed for industry.

The town&#x27;s favourable location caused the Hayes Development Company to make available sites on the north-side of the railway, adjacent to the canal, and Hayes became a centre for engineering and industry. HDC&#x27;s company secretary, Alfred Clayton, is commemorated in the name of Clayton Road. Residential districts consisting of dwellings of the garden suburb type were built to house workers after World War I.

In 1904, the parish council created Hayes Urban District (from 1930, Hayes and Harlington Urban District) in order to address the issue of population growth. Hayes and Harlington Urban District continued until 1965 when Hayes became part of the newly established London Borough of Hillingdon.
Barra Hall – Grade II listed since 1974 – was Hayes town hall between 1924 and 1979. Originally a manor house called Grove House, in the late 18th century it was home to Alderman Harvey Combe, Lord Mayor of London in 1799. It became Barra Hall in 1875, after Robert Reid – descendant of the Reid baronets of Barra – became owner. Army Cavalry were stationed at Barra Hall during World War I. After Hayes Urban District Council bought the Hall and its grounds in 1923, the grounds of the new Town Hall were given over to public use as a public park – with playground, tennis courts and paddling pool; it was opened by actress Jessie Matthews. In July 2024, a century on from Hayes Urban District&#x27;s 1923 purchase, Hillingdon Council sold Barra Hall, to HRUC. Notwithstanding the sale, the Council claimed it would safeguard the building for the future, such that it would remain a key asset to local residents.

Writer Mabel Lethbridge (1900-1968) was a munitions worker in World War I at National Filling Factory No. 7, Hayes when on 23 October 1917 she was severely injured in an explosion: others were killed. Lethbridge was at the time the youngest person to receive the British Empire Medal – in recognition of her service – and she wrote about her experience at the Hayes munitions factory in her first book, &quot;Fortune Grass&quot; (1934). National Filling Factory No. 7 was situated on land south of the railway which would later become Nestles Avenue, extending almost down to where the M4 at Cranford is now. The Hayes munitions factory employed approximately 10,000 women and 2,000 men.
Author George Orwell, who adopted his pen name while living in Hayes, lived and worked in 1932-3 as a schoolmaster at The Hawthorns High School for Boys, situated on Church Road. The school subsequently closed and the original building survived until 2022 as the Fountain House Hotel. The hotel displayed a plaque commemorating its distinguished former resident. Returning several times to Hayes, Orwell was at the same time characteristically acerbic about his time in the town, camouflaging it lightly as West Bletchley in &quot;Coming Up for Air&quot;, as Southbridge in &quot;A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, and grumbling comically in a letter to Eleanor Jacques:

Hayes . . . is one of the most godforsaken places I have ever struck. The population seems to be entirely made up of clerks who frequent tin-roofed chapels on Sundays and for the rest bolt themselves within doors.
The present-day Hayes Police Station – at 755 Uxbridge Road, UB4 8HU – opened on 19 June 1938.

The Grade II listed War Memorial at Cherry Lane Cemetery on Shepiston Lane commemorates what is believed to have been the most serious single incident (in respect of casualties) in Hayes during World War II. Thirty-seven workers of the Gramophone Company, Blyth Road – then the town&#x27;s largest employer – were killed on 7 July 1944 when a German V-1 flying bomb or &quot;doodle-bug&quot; hit a factory surface air-raid shelter. The original bomb census form, now held in the National Archives, confirms that it was a flying bomb which landed at 14.59 hours, killing twenty-four people and seriously injuring twenty-one (some of the seriously injured died later). The bomb came down at the main entrance to one shelter, causing the concrete roof to collapse. Some of the badly injured were able to be rescued from the emergency exit at the rear, but others were trapped for some hours. Twelve of the victims are buried in a mass grave in Cherry Lane Cemetery.

The Sound of Hayes Clock is located at the junction of Station Road and Station Approach. The Cabinet Office granted special permission for the clock to be inscribed in honour of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee. The inscription reads: &quot;installed on 12 September 2023 to mark the reign of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II&quot;.

Hayes featured in a 2011 House of Commons debate about social housing in London. It was alleged in the Parliamentary debate (as recorded in &quot;Hansard&quot;) that a &quot;sort of ruthless developer is taking over entire sites in [the Hayes] area to build the slums of the future.&quot;

===Industry===
Hayes has, over the years, been heavily involved with industry, both local and international, having been the home of EMI, Nestlé and H. J. Heinz Company. As well as Fairey Aviation (later merged with Westland).

The first large factory established was that of the British Electric Transformer Company (affectionately known as the B.E.T.), which moved to Hayes in 1901. The B.E.T.&#x27;s main product was the Berry transformer, invented by A. F. Berry (the company&#x27;s technical adviser and a member of the board of directors); Berry also invented the Tricity cooker.

The most significant early occupier was the Gramophone Company / EMI. The Hayes factory&#x27;s foundation stone was laid by Dame Nellie Melba. The EMI archives and some early reinforced concrete factory buildings (notably Grade II listed Enterprise House [1912] on Blyth Road, the first known work of Evan Owen Williams – described by English Heritage as &quot;the most significant engineer turned architect in twentieth-century British architecture&quot;) remain as The Old Vinyl Factory.

It was here, in the Central Research Laboratories (generally known as &quot;CRL&quot;), that Isaac Shoenberg developed (1934) the all-electronic 405-line television system (called the &quot;Marconi-EMI system&quot;, used by the BBC from 1936 until closedown of the Crystal Palace 405-line transmissions in 1985).

Alan Blumlein carried out his research into binaural sound and stereophonic gramophone recording here. &quot;Trains at Hayes Station&quot; (1935) and &quot;Walking &amp; Talking&quot; are two notable films Blumlein shot to demonstrate stereo sound on film. These films are held at the Hayes EMI archive. In 1939, working alongside the electrical firms A.C. Cossor and Pye, a 60 MHz radar was developed, and from 1941 to 1943 the H2S radar system. During the 1990s, CRL spawned another technology: Sensaura 3D positional audio. In an echo of Blumlein&#x27;s early stereo recordings, the Sensaura engineers made some of their first 3D audio recordings at Hayes &amp; Harlington railway station.

During the First World War, the EMI factories produced aircraft. Charles Richard Fairey was seconded there for a short time, before setting up his own company, Fairey Aviation, which relocated in 1918 to a large new factory across the railway in North Hyde Road. Over 4,500 aircraft were subsequently produced here, but Fairey needed an airfield to test these aircraft and in 1928 secured a site in nearby Heathrow. This became the Great West Aerodrome, which was requisitioned by the Air Ministry in 1944. It was initially developed as a heavy-bomber base intended for Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, but when the Second World War ended in 1945, it was taken over by the Ministry of Aviation and became Heathrow Airport.

In 1913, German bodybuilder and music hall performer Eugen Sandow – famous in his time as &quot;Sandow the Great&quot;, a contender for the title of world&#x27;s strongest man – opened a cocoa factory in Hayes. Sandow&#x27;s fortunes plummeted in World War I. The Sandow Cocoa Company went into liquidation, and the building and assets passed to the Hayes Cocoa Company in 1916. Hayes Cocoa was owned by Swiss chocolate company Peter, Cailler, Kohler.

In 1929, the Nestlé company bought out Peter, Cailler, Kohler and located its major chocolate and instant coffee works on the canal, adjacent to the railway east of the station; it was for many years the company&#x27;s UK headquarters. The factory&#x27;s elegant Art Deco façade was long a local landmark. The road that led to the factory was renamed Nestlé&#x27;s Avenue (from Sandow Avenue, so-named after the German strongman); Sandow Crescent, a &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; off Nestlé&#x27;s Avenue, remains. The Hayes Nestlé factory closed in 2014 at a cost of 230 jobs. Developers Segro bought the 30-acre Nestlé site in early 2015.

Opposite Nestlé, on the other side of the canal, the Aeolian Company and its associates manufactured pianolas and rolls from just before World War I until the Great Depression. That, and the increasing sophistication of the gramophone record market, led to its demise. Its facilities were subsequently used by, among others, Kraft Foods and Wall&#x27;s, a meat processor and ice cream manufacturer. Only one of the Aeolian Company&#x27;s striking Edwardian buildings remains. Designed by notable English architect Walter Cave, Benlow Works (post-World War II owner Benny Lowenthal renamed the factory after himself) on Silverdale Road is a four-storey structure with Diocletian windows on the top floor. It is Grade II listed.

Food company Heinz&#x27;s UK headquarters was located at South Building, Hayes Park, Hayes between 1965 and 2017. The Grade II* listed Heinz buildings were culturally significant as the only British example of the work of influential American architect Gordon Bunshaft (then principal design partner of distinguished architectural firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill) and one of only two designs by him in Western Europe. In February 2024, Hillingdon Council heard an application in relation to the buildings&#x27; Grade II* listed status. Historic England raised concerns, saying the existing buildings were &quot;highly significant for their sophisticated sculptural form&quot;. But the planning officers decided that conversion of significant architecture in Hayes meant &quot;less than substantial&quot; heritage harm, and approved the conversion of Bunshaft&#x27;s designs into 124 flats.

United Biscuits – makers of McVitie&#x27;s biscuits and Jacob&#x27;s Cream Crackers – long had its UK headquarters in Hayes. The company formally changed its base to Chiswick in June 2021.

Callard &amp; Bowser manufactured a popular line of English toffees and other confectionary at its Pump Lane, Hayes factory between 1956 and 1983. 635 jobs were lost in the two years leading up to the factory&#x27;s closure.
The first factory to produce the iconic Marshall amplifier opened in June 1964 in Silverdale Road, Hayes. Guitar-amplification pioneer Jim Marshall employed fifteen people to build amplifiers and cabinets in a 5,000-square-foot space.

Hayes has been home to businesses in various industries over the years. Among others: UK caravan manufacturer Car Cruiser built caravans in North Hyde Road for a short time in the early 1930s. From the early 1970s to 2003, McAlpine Helicopters Limited (Operational Support Services Limited) – later renamed McAlpine Aviation Services Limited – operated from two purpose-built helicopter hangars in Swallowfield Way, Hayes. Damont Audio was a vinyl pressing plant based in Hayes from the 1970s to 2005. &quot;DAMONT&quot; or &quot;Damont Audio Ltd&quot; is typically inscribed in the run-out groove of vinyl produced at the plant.

In 2024, industry was impacted when Hillingdon Council acquired industrial site HPH3, Hyde Park for development into more accommodation.

In 1971, Neville Sandelson, MP for Hayes and Harlington 1971–1983, articulated concern about &quot;de&quot;-industrialisation in the House of Commons: &quot;The position in Hayes . . . is causing grave anxiety both in regard to the present and the long-term prospects. The closure of long-standing industrial firms in the area has become a contagion which shows no sign of abating&quot;. By 1982, Sandelson said the &quot;contagion&quot; had become &quot;an epidemic&quot;, reiterating: &quot;a subject of great concern to every family in Hayes and Harlington . . . the progressive decline of industry.&quot;

===Churches===

St Mary the Virgin Church, Hayes on Church Road is the oldest building in Hayes. It is Grade II* listed. The central portion of the church, the chancel and the nave, was built in the 13th century, the north aisle in the 15th century (as was the tower), and the south aisle in the 16th century, along with the lychgate and the south porch. The lychgate and wall to the south are Grade II listed. Hayes&#x27;s entry in the Domesday Book (1086) makes no mention of a church or chapel, and the name of St Mary suggests a 12th-century dedication as it was at this time that church dedications in this name first appeared in England. Besides the church, the other main building in medieval villages was the manor house. The manor house formerly associated with the church was assigned to Canterbury Cathedral by Christian priest Warherdus as far back as 830 AD.

The site of the original manor house is not known, but it is likely to have been on or near the site of the building latterly on Church Road called the Manor House, parts of which dated from the early 16th century. At the time of the Norman Conquest, Archbishop Lanfranc had contacts with the parish. St Mary&#x27;s has a 12th-century font, and many interesting memorials and brasses. The brass to Robert Lellee, Rector somewhere between 1356 and 1375, is purportedly the oldest brass in Middlesex. Adjacent to it is another to Rector Robert Burgeys (1408–1421). (The first recorded Rector was Peter de Lymonicen [1259]). There are tombs in the church to Walter Grene (1456), Thomas Higate (1576), and Sir Edward Fenner (1611), Judge of the King&#x27;s Bench. The latter tomb covers earlier tiling on the wall and floors. Some partly uncovered pre-Reformation wall-paintings and a large mural (dating from the 14th century) of Saint Christopher with the infant Child are on the North wall. A brass to Veare Jenyns (1644) relates to the Court of Charles I, while other Jenynses, who were Lords of the Manor, link with Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough. Judge John Heath, after whom &quot;Judge Heath Lane&quot; was named, is also buried at St Mary&#x27;s.

Victorian restorers donated a number of windows, and more recent additions include windows to Saints Anselm and Nicholas. The Coronation window is in the north aisle above the Triptych painted by the pre-Raphaelite Edward Arthur Fellowes Prynne. His brother George Fellowes Prynne carved the Reredos with St Anselm and St George in the niches. The embossed roof of the Nave reflects the Tudor period with emblems of the crucifixion and the arms of Henry and Aragon (the lands passed to Henry VIII as a consequence of the English Reformation). Cherry Lane Cemetery on Shepiston Lane was founded in the mid-1930s to provide a new burial ground when the churchyard at St Mary&#x27;s Church had run out of space.

St Anselm&#x27;s Church was completed in 1929 to the design of architect Hubert Christian Corlette. Noted designer MacDonald Gill was responsible for the panelled ceiling. The church&#x27;s foundation stone was laid on 13 May 1927 by Sir John Eldon Bankes. The east window is by James Powell and Sons of Whitefriars, London. The church was Grade II listed in November 2019. St Anselm&#x27;s is so-named because William Rufus (1056 – 1100) sent Archbishop (later Saint) Anselm of Canterbury (c.1033 – 1109) to stay in the manor house of St Mary&#x27;s Church, as it was the nearest of the Archbishop&#x27;s manors to Windsor, where William Rufus resided.

The Immaculate Heart of Mary, the Roman Catholic church in Botwell, was built in 1961, replacing the earlier church built in 1912. The adjacent school, Botwell House Catholic Primary, opened on 25 August 1931. The church&#x27;s picture of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (which measures 5½m x 3m) was painted by Pietro Annigoni (1910–1988) in Florence, and took nine months to complete. The Grade II listed, early nineteenth-century presbytery, &quot;Botwell House&quot;, was originally the home of Hayes&#x27;s principal landowner, John Baptist Shackle.

==Culture==

Hayes&#x27;s Beck Theatre opened in 1977, and offers a wide range of touring shows in a welcoming modern building. &quot;The Beck&quot; is very much a community theatre, offering one-night concerts, comedy, drama, films, opera, and pantomime.

The Open Air Theatre, Barra Hall Park originated in 1951 as a community venue for music, theatre and dance. The local community raised funds for a 2005 rebuild.

Hayes&#x27;s Botwell Green Library is situated in the Leisure Centre (address: East Avenue, UB3 2HW), which in 2010 replaced both the old Hayes Library (opened 1933 on Golden Crescent) and the old swimming baths (opened 1967 on the opposite side of Central Avenue). Following its 2010 closure, the derelict old Hayes Pool building was close to being used as a location for 2012 James Bond film &quot;Skyfall&quot;, but in late 2012 the Council demolished it, and in 2017 a branch of Lidl opened on the former baths site.

Pubs in Hayes include: &quot;The Botwell Inn&quot;, Coldharbour Lane; &quot;The Old Crown&quot;, Station Road; &quot;Captain Morgan&#x27;s&quot;, Clayton Road; &quot;Wishing Well&quot; &amp; &quot;Five Rivers&quot; (&quot;Ye Olde Crowne&quot;), Uxbridge Road; &quot;Brook House&quot;, Kingshill Avenue; &quot;Music Box&quot;, Bourne Avenue; and &quot;Great Western&quot;, Dawley Road. The &quot;Hayes Working Men&#x27;s Club&quot; is on Pump Lane (from 1918 to 1974 it was in a large house called Sandgate on Station Road, where Iceland now stands). The &quot;Hayes Conservative Club&quot; is on Church Road; the Irish Social Club (&quot;Fáilte&quot;) – originally associated with the &quot;Botwell Club&quot; – operates here.

Hayes had a vibrant, social pub culture for most of the 20th-century: in 1988, a long list of the town&#x27;s pubs could still include the words: &quot;many of which exist today&quot;. Pubs began to close in subsequent years, being demolished for development or converted for other uses. The &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; – formerly at 830 Uxbridge Road – was the town&#x27;s earliest recorded and longest surviving inn. Though not the original seventeenth-century structure, the pub stood on the same site for over 350 years (1665-2021). Lost pubs include some other longstanding town landmarks: &quot;Vine&quot;, Angel Lane (closed 1992); &quot;Firefly&quot;, Welbeck Avenue (1999); &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, Church Road (2002); &quot;Tumbler&quot;, Station Road (2003); &quot;White Hart&quot;, Uxbridge Road (2003); &quot;Curran&#x27;s&quot;, Uxbridge Road (2005); &quot;Blue Anchor&quot;, Printing House Lane (2008); &quot;Ram&quot;, Dawley Road (2008); &quot;Waggon &amp; Horses&quot;, Uxbridge Road (2008); &quot;Royal Standard&quot; (&quot;King&#x27;s Arms&quot;/&quot;Bad Bob&#x27;s&quot;), Coldharbour Lane (2010); &quot;George Orwell&quot;, Coldharbour Lane (2012); &quot;Golden Cross&quot;, Botwell Lane (2014); &quot;Victoria&quot;, North Hyde Road (2014); &quot;Queen&#x27;s Head&quot; (&quot;The Grange&quot;/&quot;Tommy Flynn&#x27;s&quot;/&quot;Blue Lagoon&quot;), Wood End Green Road (2015); &quot;Hambro Arms&quot; (&quot;Lounge&quot;), Dawley Road (2016); &quot;Crane&quot;, North Hyde Road (2017); &quot;Angel&quot;, Uxbridge Road (2018); &quot;Carpenter&#x27;s Arms&quot;, Uxbridge Road (2023); &quot;Grapes&quot;, Uxbridge Road (2024).

Social clubs likewise began to close in the 21st-century. &quot;St Claret&#x27;s&quot; (known locally as the &quot;Botwell Club&quot;) at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Church, Botwell Lane was officially established in 1966, but its roots went back to the 1930s, when an increasing number of Irish people began coming to live in Hayes. In its 1970s/1980s heyday, the &quot;Botwell Club&quot; was (in common with the working men&#x27;s club) a &quot;thriving community hub&quot;. The Church closed the club on its long-established footing in September 2008, and despite organisers&#x27; attempts to keep going on a new lease agreement basis, in 2013 &quot;The Irish Post&quot; noted the &quot;Botwell Club&quot; was facing closure, owing in large part to high rent. The bar &amp; social club attached to Hayes F.C.&#x27;s century-old Church Road home-ground closed in 2010 when the football club was forced to make way for a large housing estate development. &quot;Glenister Hall&quot; (a former annex of the working men&#x27;s club) and an adjacent sports-ground at the end of Minet Drive were closed and demolished in advance of a controversial 2011 housing development.

Much-loved entertainer Dame Gracie Fields visited Hayes&#x27;s Gramophone factory in 1933; Pathé News footage shows Gracie pressing her four millionth record alongside factory employees and singing the title song of her 1932 film &quot;Looking on the Bright Side&quot; to huge cheers. Earlier, several noted music hall performers came to record at Hayes&#x27;s Gramophone studios: George Formby&#x27;s father, George Formby Sr, recorded &quot;Grandfather&#x27;s Clock&quot; on 12 April 1916; G. H. Elliott recorded &quot;Mississippi Honeymoon&quot; on 17 November 1922; and Harry Lauder recorded &quot;Roamin&#x27; In The Gloamin&quot;&#x27; and other songs in March 1926, as well as visiting Hayes on other occasions in the 1910s and &#x27;20s.

Music hall strongman Eugen Sandow (1867–1925) – whose 1913 cocoa factory was significant to Hayes&#x27;s history in industry (see the &quot;Industry&quot; section, above) – is commemorated in a 28-metre-high mural completed in 2022. The period-inspired artwork is on the gable-end of a ten-storey building, viewable from the Elizabeth line.

===Cinemas===

Hayes has had six cinemas in its history. (1.) The town&#x27;s first cinema, in the silent era, opened in 1913, and was named simply &quot;The Hayes Cinema&quot;. It was situated at 53–55 Station Road, Hayes – now the site of a branch of Poundland (formerly Woolworths). The Hayes Cinema was renamed &quot;Gem Cinema&quot; before its closure in the middle of World War I, in 1916. (2.) &quot;The Regent Cinema&quot; stood between 1924 and 1938 at 16 Station Road, Hayes – now the site of a branch of NatWest bank. The Regent Cinema subsequently became &quot;The Regent Theatre&quot; (1948–54). Playwright John Osborne performed at the theatre as a young actor, and stars including Kenneth Williams, Diana Dors and John Le Mesurier performed there also early in their careers. Sylvia Rayman&#x27;s groundbreaking &quot;all-women play&quot; &quot;Women of Twilight&quot; (1951) was premiered at Hayes&#x27;s Regent Theatre. (3.) &quot;The Corinth Cinema&quot; opened in 1933 at 1040 Uxbridge Road. Renamed &quot;The Essoldo&quot; in 1949, it was the first cinema in the area to be equipped with CinemaScope and stereophonic sound. After purchasing an alternative building nearby in 1957 (&quot;infra&quot;), the Essoldo chain closed this cinema in 1961. The address is now the site of the town&#x27;s Point West Building. (4.) &quot;The Ambassador Theatre&quot; existed between 1938 and 1961 on the area of East Avenue, Hayes which is now occupied by the British Telecommunications Centre (formerly a GPO telephone exchange). Actress Valerie Hobson made a personal appearance on the occasion of the Ambassador Theatre&#x27;s opening on 19 December 1938; she starred in the film screened for the occasion: &quot;This Man Is News&quot;. (5.) &quot;The Savoy Cinema&quot; existed from 1939 to 1957 at 466 Uxbridge Road, Hayes. The building was designed by noted cinema architect George Coles. Some famous artists performed on stage at Hayes&#x27;s Savoy Cinema over the years – Max Miller, Josephine Baker and Adam Faith among them. The Essoldo chain bought the Savoy in 1957, renaming it &quot;The Essoldo&quot; in 1962 (after closing its nearby namesake in 1961). This incarnation of the Essoldo closed in 1967. Coles&#x27; building was converted into an Essoldo Bingo Club; it became a Ladbrokes Lucky 7 Club, then a branch of Mecca Bingo. A bingo hall since 1967, residents fought unsuccessfully against closure in 2023. (6.) &quot;The Classic Cinema&quot; (1972–1986) was located above a Waitrose supermarket, at 502 Uxbridge Road, Hayes. Subsequently, demolished, its entrance was immediately to the left of the former Savoy (see 5, above).

Interim locations included St Christopher&#x27;s Approved School and Harlington Scout Hut, until in 1978 the club was granted a piece of land at the back of Judge Heath Lane Sports Centre. A concerted effort by club-trainers, boxers and committee-members produced for the club a purpose-built gym. In 2006 the land on which the gym was built was sold for development, and, following a campaign, a replacement facility was built to the front of the former Hayes Stadium. From its formation, the club has produced successful boxers at national competition level. Chris Finnegan represented the pinnacle of the club&#x27;s success, winning the 1966 Amateur Boxing Association Middleweight title, before going on to win the Olympic Middleweight gold medal in 1968.

<text>Frisia () is a cross-border cultural region in Northwestern Europe. Stretching along the Wadden Sea, it encompasses the north of the Netherlands and parts of northwestern Germany. Wider definitions of &quot;Frisia&quot; may include the island of Rem and the other Danish Wadden Sea Islands. The region is traditionally inhabited by the Frisians, a West Germanic ethnic group.

== Etymology ==
The contemporary name for the region stems from Latin , an ethnonym used for a group of ancient tribes in modern-day Northwestern Germany, possibly being a loanword of Proto-Germanic , meaning &quot;curly, crisp&quot;, presumably referring to the hair of the tribesmen. In some areas, the local translation of &quot;Frisia&quot; is used to refer to another subregion. On the North Frisian islands, for instance, &quot;Frisia&quot; and &quot;Frisians&quot; refer to (the inhabitants of) mainland North Frisia. In Saterland Frisian, the term &quot;Fräislound&quot; specifically refers to Ostfriesland.

During the French occupation of the Netherlands, the name for the Frisian department was . In English, both &quot;Frisia&quot; and &quot;Friesland&quot; () may be interchangeably used to refer to the region.

== Subdivisions ==
Frisia is commonly divided into three sections:

*West Frisia in the Netherlands roughly corresponds to the province of Friesland (&quot;Fryslân&quot;). In a broader sense, it also includes West Friesland in northern North Holland and the Ommelanden in the province of Groningen, though the West Frisian language is only spoken in Friesland proper. Dialects with strong West Frisian substrates, including Low German and Low Franconian, are also spoken in West Frisia. In the province of Groningen, people speak Gronings, a Low Saxon dialect with a strong Frisian substrate. Rural Groningen originally belonged to the Frisian lands &quot;east of the Lauwers&quot; and is therefore more closely linked to East Frisia than to the west. In West Friesland, West Frisian Dutch – a Hollandic dialect with strong Frisian influences – is spoken.
*East Frisia in Lower Saxony, Germany roughly corresponds to the historical regions of East Frisia (Aurich, Leer, Wittmund and Emden) and Oldenburger Friesland (Friesland and Wilhelmshaven), and the municipality of Saterland. In a broader sense, it also includes the Butjadingen peninsula (former Rüstringen) and Land Wursten. Usually, only the people from East Frisia proper () refer to themselves as East Frisians. The German name &quot;Ostfriesland&quot; distinguishes the historical region from &quot;Ost-Friesland&quot;, which refers to East Frisia as a whole.
*North Frisia in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany roughly corresponds to the district of Nordfriesland and the archipelago of Heligoland. It includes the North Frisian Islands, where varieties of the North Frisian language are spoken. It stretches from the Eider River in the south to the border of Denmark in the north. Until the Second Schleswig War in 1864, the region belonged to the Danish Duchy of Schleswig.

== History ==
=== Roman era ===
The people, later to be known as Frisii, began settling in Frisia in the 6th century BC. According to Pliny the Elder, in Roman times, the Frisians (or rather their close neighbours, the Chauci) lived on terps, man-made hills. According to other sources, the Frisians lived along a broader expanse of the North Sea (or &quot;Frisian Sea&quot;) coast. At this time, Frisia comprised the present-day provinces of Friesland, Groningen, North Holland and parts of South Holland.

=== Early Middle Ages ===


Frisian presence during the Early Middle Ages has been documented from North-Western Flanders up to the Weser River Estuary. According to archaeological evidence, these Frisians were not the Frisians of Roman times, but the descendants of Anglo-Saxon immigrants from the German Bight, arriving during the Great Migration. By the 8th century, ethnic Frisians also started to colonize the coastal areas North of the Eider River under Danish rule. The nascent Frisian languages were spoken all along the southern North Sea coast. Today, the whole region is sometimes referred to as Greater Frisia ().

Distant authors seem to have made little distinction between Frisians and Saxons. The Byzantine Procopius described three peoples living in Great Britain: Angles, Frisians and Britons, and the Danish author of &quot;Knútsdrápa&quot; celebrating the 11th-century Canute the Great used &quot;Frisians&quot; as a synonym of &quot;English&quot;. The historian and sociologist George Homans has made a case for Frisian cultural domination in East Anglia since the 5th century, pointing to distinct land-holdings arrangements in carucates (these forming vills assembled in leets), partible inheritance patterns of common lands held in by kin, resistance to manorialism and other social institutions. Some East Anglian sources called the mainland inhabitants Warnii, rather than Frisians.

During the 7th and 8th centuries, Frankish chronologies mention the northern Low Countries as the kingdom of the Frisians. According to Medieval legends, this kingdom comprised the coastal provinces of the Netherlands, from the Scheldt River to the Weser River and further East. Archaeological research does not confirm this idea, as the petty kingdoms appear to have been rather small and short-lived.

The earliest Frisian records name four social classes, the ( in Latin documents) and , who together made up the &quot;Free Frisians&quot; who might bring suit at court, and the &quot;laten&quot; or &quot;liten&quot; with the slaves, who were absorbed into the &quot;laten&quot; during the Early Middle Ages, as slavery was not so much formally abolished, as evaporated. The &quot;laten&quot; were tenants of lands they did not own and might be tied to it in the manner of serfs, but in later times might buy their freedom.

The basic land-holding unit for assessment of taxes and military contributions was – according to Homans – the &quot;ploegg&quot; (cf. &quot;plow&quot;) or &quot;teen&quot; (cf. tithing, cf. &quot;hundred&quot;), which, however, also passed under other local names. The &quot;teen&quot; was pledged to supply ten men for the &quot;heer&quot;, or army. &quot;Ploegg&quot; or &quot;teen&quot; formed a unit of which the members were collectively responsible for the performance of any of the men. The &quot;ploegg&quot; or East Frisian &quot;rott&quot; was a compact holding that originated with a single lineage or kinship, whose men in early times went to war under their chief, and devolved in medieval times into a union of neighbors rather than kith and kin. Several, often three, &quot;ploeggs&quot; were grouped into a &quot;burar&quot;, whose members controlled and adjudicated the uses of pasturage (but not tillage) which the &quot;ploeggs&quot; held in common, and came to be in charge of roads, ditches and dikes. Twelve &quot;ploeggs&quot; made up a &quot;long&quot; hundred, responsible for supplying a hundred armed men, four of which made a &quot;go&quot; (cf. &quot;Gau&quot;). Homans&#x27; ideas, which were largely based on studies now considered to be outdated, have not been followed up by Continental scholars.

The 7th-century Frisian Realm (650–734) under the kings Aldegisel and Redbad, had its centre of power in the city of Utrecht. Its ancient customary law was drawn up as the &quot;Lex Frisionum&quot; in the late eighth century. Its end came in 734 at the Battle of the Boarn, when the Frisians were defeated by the Franks, who then conquered the western part up to the Lauwers. Frankish troops conquered the area east of the Lauwers in 785, after Charlemagne defeated the Saxon leader Widukind. The Carolingians laid Frisia under the rule of &quot;grewan&quot;, a title that has been loosely related to count in its early sense of &quot;governor&quot; rather than &quot;feudal overlord&quot;.

During the 7th to 10th centuries, Frisian merchants and skippers played an important part in the international luxury trade, establishing commercial districts in distant cities as Sigtuna, Hedeby, Ribe, York, London, Duisburg, Cologne, Mainz, and Worms.

The establishment of the Frisian trade network played a significant role in maintaining regional peace during the late Middle Ages. While interpersonal violence was on the rise almost everywhere else in Europe, Northern Europe and especially Frisia managed to maintain low levels of violence due in part to its well-developed society and established rule of law, which were results of extensive trade.

The Frisian coastal areas were partly occupied by Danish Vikings in the 840s, until these were expelled between 885 and 920. Recently, it has been suggested that the Vikings did not conquer Frisia, but settled peacefully in certain districts (such as the islands of Walcheren and Wieringen), where they built simple forts and cooperated and traded with the native Frisians. One of their leaders was Rorik of Dorestad.

=== Upstalsboom League ===

During the 12th century Frisian noblemen and the city of Groningen founded the Upstalsboom League under the slogan of &quot;Frisian freedom&quot; to counter feudalizing tendencies. The league consisted of modern Friesland, Groningen, East Frisia, Harlingerland, Jever and Rüstringen. The Frisian districts in West Friesland West of the Zuiderzee did not participate, neither did the districts North of the Eider River along the Danish North Sea coast (Schleswig-Holstein). The former were occupied by the count of Holland in 1289, and the latter were governed by the Duke of Schleswig and the king of Denmark. The same holds true for the district of Land Wursten East of the Weser River. The Upstalsboom League was revived in the early 14th century, but it collapsed after 1337. By then, the non-Frisian city of Groningen took the lead of the independent coastal districts.

=== 15th century ===
The 15th century saw the demise of Frisian republicanism. In East Frisia, a leading nobleman from the Cirksena-family managed to defeat his competitors with the help of the Hanseatic League. In 1464 he acquired the title of count of East Frisia. The king of Denmark was successful in subduing the coastal districts North of the Eider River. The Dutch provinces of Friesland and Groningen remained independent until 1498. By then Friesland was conquered by Duke Albert of Saxony-Meissen. The city of Groningen, which had started to dominate the surrounding rural districts, surrendered to count Edzard of East Frisia in 1506. The city conveyed its remaining privileges to the Habsburg Empire in 1536. The district of Butjadingen (formerly Rüstringen) was occupied by the Count of Oldenburg in 1514, the Land Wursten by the Prince-bishop of Bremen in 1525.

=== Modern age ===
In the early 16th century, the pirate and freedom fighter Pier Gerlofs Donia (Grutte Pier) challenged Saxon authority in Friesland during a prolonged guerrilla war, backed by the Duke of Guelders. He had several successes and was feared by Hollandic authorities, but he died as a farmer in 1520. According to the legend he was seven feet tall. A statue of Grutte Pier by was erected in Kimswert in 1985.

In the 1560s many Frisans joined the revolt led by William of Orange against the Habsburg monarchy. In 1577 the province of Friesland became part of the nascent Dutch Republic, as its representatives signed the Union of Utrecht. The city of Groningen was conquered by the Dutch in 1594. Since then, membership of the Dutch Republic was perceived as a guarantee for the preservation of civil liberties. Actual power, however, was usurped by the landowning gentry. Protests against aristocratic rule led to a democratic movement in the 1780s.

== Frisian territories ==

*When West Friesland was conquered by the County of Holland in 1289, this was the end of a series of wars between the county of Holland and Friesland that started at the end of the 11th century. The Dutch conquest occurred immediately after the disastrous St. Lucia&#x27;s flood in which many Frisians in the area were killed. After the conquest the district of West Friesland, which also comprised the islands of Wieringen, Texel, and Vlieland, had its own seats in the Estates of Holland and West Friesland. When the province of Holland was split up in the constitutional reform of 1840, West-Friesland became a part of North Holland. The name of West Friesland has also been used by an intercommunal administrative board (&quot;samenwerkingsregio&quot;) and a water board.
*Friesland became an independent member of the Dutch Republic in 1581. It is now a Dutch province, in 1996 renamed as &quot;Fryslân&quot;.
*The islands of Terschelling, Ameland, and Schiermonnikoog were independent seignories, which were integrated into the province of Friesland during the 19th and 20th centuries.
*Groningen, formerly &quot;Stad en Lande&quot; (the city of Groningen and its surroundings), became an independent member of the Dutch Republic in 1594. Now it is a Dutch province. As a rule, its inhabitants do not consider their province as a part of Frisia, though the area has many cultural ties with neighbouring East Frisia.
*East Frisia was an independent county since 1464, later a principality within the Holy Roman Empire until 1744. By then, it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. After a period of Dutch and French rule, it became part of the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814, which was annexed by Prussia in 1866. Now it consists of several districts within the federal state of Lower Saxony in the Federal Republic of Germany.
*Harlingerland was a seignory, inherited by the count of East Frisia in 1600.
*Jever was a seignory, annexed by the County of Oldenburg in 1573 and, after a prolonged period of Saxony-Anhalt, Russian, Dutch and French rule, reunited with Oldenburg in 1814. It is now part of the district of Friesland within the federal state of Lower Saxony.
*Kniphausen was a seignory, split off from the County of Oldenburg in 1667 and reunited with its surroundings in 1854 (effectively in 1813).
*Saterland was a tiny Frisian district under the Prince-bishop of Münster, in 1814 assigned to the Kingdom of Hannover.
*Butjadingen was a coastal republic, a remnant of the largely submerged district of Rüstringen. It was conquered by the Count of Oldenburg in 1514. After a period of Danish rule, it became part of the Duchy of Oldenburg in 1774, which remained a more or less independent state within the German Empire until 1918. Butjadingen is now part of the district of Wesermarsch within the federal state of Lower Saxony.
*Land Wursten was a coastal republic, conquered by the Prince-bishop of Bremen in 1525. It became part of the Duchy of Bremen-Verden. The latter was, after a period of Swedish rule, integrated into the Kingdom of Hanover in 1715. It is now part of the district of Cuxhaven within the federal state of Lower Saxony.
*North Frisia originally corresponded to the Uthlande in the Kingdom of Denmark. Later, North Frisia became a part of the Danish Duchy of Schleswig (or Southern Jutland, &quot;Sønderjylland&quot;) and of the royal enclaves (&quot;Kongerigske enklaver&quot;) of the Kingdom of Denmark. The duchy was conquered by Prussia in 1864. Now it forms a district within the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein. Helgoland is part of the district of Pinneberg. North Frisia was never a part of the Holy Roman Empire.

== Contemporary regionalism ==

During the late 19th and early 20th century, &quot;Frisian freedom&quot; became the slogan of a regionalist movement in Friesland, demanding equal rights for the Frisian language and culture within the Netherlands. The West Frisian language and its urban dialects are spoken by the majority of the inhabitants. In East Frisia, the idea of &quot;Frisian freedom&quot; became entangled with regional sentiments as well, though the East Frisian language had been replaced by Low German dialects as early as the 15th century. In Groningen, on the other hand, Frisian sentiments faded away at the end of the 16th century. In North Frisia, regional sentiments concentrate around the surviving North Frisian dialects, which are spoken by a sizeable minority of the population, though Lower German is far more widespread.

=== Regional political parties ===
== Languages ==

A half-million Frisians in the province of Friesland in the Netherlands speak West Frisian. Several thousand people in Nordfriesland and Heligoland in Germany speak a collection of North Frisian dialects. A small number of Saterland Frisian language speakers live in four villages in Lower Saxony, in the Saterland region of Cloppenburg county, just beyond the boundaries of traditional East Frisia. Many Frisians speak Low Saxon dialects which have a Frisian substratum known as Friso-Saxon, especially in East Frisia, where the local dialects are called Oostfräisk (&quot;East Frisian&quot;) or Oostfräisk Plat (East Frisian Low Saxon). In the provinces of Friesland and Groningen, and in North Frisia, there are also areas where Friso-Saxon dialects are predominantly spoken, such as Gronings. In West Frisia, there are West Frisian-influenced dialects of Dutch such as West Frisian Dutch and Stadsfries.

==Flag==


While the subdivisions of Frisia have their own regional flags, Frisia as a whole has not historically had a flag of its own. In September 2006, a flag for a united Frisia – known as the &quot;Interfrisian Flag&quot; – was designed by the Groep fan Auwerk. This separatist group supports the unification of Frisia as an independent country. The design was inspired by the Nordic Cross flag. The four &quot;pompeblêden&quot; (water lily leaves) represent the contemporary variety of the Frisian regions – North, South, West and East.

The design was not accepted by the Interfrisian Council. Instead, the council adopted the idea of an Interfrisian flag and created a design of its own, containing elements of the flags of the council&#x27;s three sections. Neither of the two flags is widely used.

<text>Say–Meyer syndrome is a rare X-linked genetic disorder that is mostly characterized as developmental delay. It is one of the rare causes of short stature. It is closely related with trigonocephaly (a misshapen forehead due to premature fusion of bones in the skull). People with Say–Meyer syndrome have impaired growth, deficits in motor skills development and mental state.

It is suggested that it is from a X-linked transmission.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Common signs of Say–Meyer syndrome are trigonocephaly as well as head and neck symptoms. The head and neck symptoms come in the form of craniosynostosis affecting the metopic suture (the dense connective tissue structure that divides the two halves of the skull in children which usually fuse together by the age of six). Symptoms of Say–Meyer syndrome other than developmental delay and short stature include
* Intellectual disability.
* Low-set ears/posteriorly rotated ears
* Intellectual deficit as well as learning disability
* Intrauterine growth retardation (poor growth of a baby while it is in the mother&#x27;s womb)
* Posterior fontanel
* Premature synostosis of the lambdoid suture (the fusion of the bones to the joint is premature)
* Narrow forehead
* Trigonocephaly (a frontal bone anomaly that is characterized by a premature fusion of the bones which gives the forehead a triangular shape)
* Hypotelorism or hypertelorism (reduced or increased width between the eyes)
* Craniosynostosis (when one or more seam-like junctions between two bones fuses by turning into bone. This changes the growth pattern of the skull)
* Low birth weight and height
The affected patients sometimes show a highly arched palate, clinodactyly (a defect in which toes or fingers are positioned abnormally) and ventricular septal defect (a heart defect that allows blood to pass directly from left to the right ventricle which is caused by an opening in the septum). Overall, Say–Meyer syndrome impairs growth, motor function, and mental state.

===Growth and development===
The growth retardation dates from the intrauterine period (development in the uterus.) The long-term developmental growth and outcome is not known, but the early childhood development is known, which is said to be moderately delayed. Craniosynostosis is usually rare among the X-Linked Intellectual Disability Syndromes, but when it is present, it affects the metopic structure (forehead).

== Causes ==
It is a disorder that is mostly characterized as developmental delay and short stature. Magnetic resonance imaging scans usually reveal that there is a decreased volume of white matter in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres, a brain stem that is smaller in size, and a thin corpus callosum (nerve fibers that connect the two hemispheres of the brain). The syndrome is one of the rare causes of short stature.

==Diagnosis==
== Treatment ==

===Surgical===
To treat the trigonocephaly, expanding the distance between orbits using springs seems to work. It allows enough space for the brain to grow and it creates a normal horizontal axis of the orbits and supraorbital bar. The endoscopic surgery started to become popular since the early 1990s, but it has some technical limitations (only strip craniectomy is possible). There have been few attempts to go beyond the limits.

Aesthetic outcomes of metopic surgery have been good. Surgery does not have a perfect outcome because there will most likely be minor irregularities. Sometimes reoperations are needed for the severe cases. Trying to hollow out the temporal, and the hypoterlorism are very hard to correct. The hypotelorism usually stays not corrected and in order to correct the temporal hollowing, a second operation is most likely needed.

== History ==
The Say–Meyer syndrome was named after Burhan Say and Julia Meyer in 1981 after they observed trigonocephaly in 3 males who were all related. Each male was found to have a X-linked recessive inheritance. The oldest one was found to be mentally retarded while the other two nephews were found to have 
* a closed posterior fontanelle (gap between bones in the human skull).
* a small anterior fontanelle (allows deformation of the skull for the brain to grow).
* a narrow forehead.
* hypotelorism
* marked retardation in weight, height, head circumference, and psychomotor development.
Later on, Say and Meyer have not been able to find any similar case and they classified the disorder as trigonocephaly with minor anomalies. They considered it different from trigonocephaly because trigonocephaly only deals with a deformed head that leads to facial and cranial deformities. Say–Meyer syndrome has both facial and cranial deformities as well as short stature and developmental delay.

<text>The London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham () is a London borough in West London and which also forms part of Inner London. The borough was formed in 1965 as the London Borough of Hammersmith from the merger of the former Metropolitan Boroughs of Fulham and Hammersmith. The name was changed to Hammersmith and Fulham in 1979. The borough borders Brent to the north, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea to the east, Wandsworth to the south, Richmond upon Thames to the south west, and Hounslow and Ealing to the west.

Traversed by the east–west main roads of the A4 Great West Road and the A40 Westway, many international corporations have offices in the borough. The local council is Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council. The borough is amongst the four most expensive boroughs for residential properties in the United Kingdom, along with Kensington and Chelsea, the City of Westminster and Camden.

The borough is unique in London in having three professional football clubs: Chelsea, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers.

==History==
The area of the modern borough broadly corresponds to the ancient parish of Fulham, which was historically part of the county of Middlesex. The manor (estate) of Fulham can be traced back to the seventh century when it was granted to the Bishop of London. The chapelry of Hammersmith was given its own vestry in 1631, making it a separate civil parish from Fulham.

From 1856 the area was governed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, which was established to provide services across the metropolis of London. In 1889 the Metropolitan Board of Works&#x27; area was made the County of London. From 1856 until 1900 the lower tier of local government within the metropolis comprised various parish vestries and district boards. From 1856 until 1886 the two parishes of Fulham and Hammersmith were administered together as the Fulham District. The Fulham district was dissolved in 1886 when the vestries for its two parishes took on district functions.

In 1900 the lower tier was reorganised into metropolitan boroughs, the two parishes becoming the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham and the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith.

The modern borough was formed in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, covering the combined area of the former metropolitan boroughs of Fulham and Hammersmith. The new borough was originally called the London Borough of Hammersmith, but the council changed the borough&#x27;s name to the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham with effect from 1 April 1979.

Fulham saw industrialisation and urbanisation from the start of the 19th-century, with the establishment of the world&#x27;s first energy utility company, at Sands End in 1824, followed by road and rail transport development to the east of the borough. Vacant land by the new railway sidings on the boundary with Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council led to the development of the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, visited by Queen Victoria in 1879 when she attended Bill Cody&#x27;s Wild West Show at West Brompton. There followed numerous international fairs and exhibitions for a century until the construction of Earls Court II in the borough in the 1980s. This was dismantled by developers in 2015.

At the other end of today&#x27;s borough, in 1908, the Franco-British Exhibition and Olympic Games were hosted in Hammersmith, at White City, London, but the site then took many decades to be redeveloped. In 1960, the BBC opened the BBC Television Centre. Westfield London opened in 1988, a large development with new transport links and a shopping centre.

Hammersmith has been the seat of the Polish Social and Cultural Centre, known as &quot;POSK&quot; in King Street, for several decades. It houses a number of organisations which serve Polish expatriates and others interested in Polish culture, including a theatre, an exhibition space, a library and archives as well as retail and dining facilities.

The borough is the home of an 1893 establishment, the Sacred Heart High School, Hammersmith on Hammersmith Broadway, and of Lady Margaret School (LMS) on Parsons Green, a school that welcomes girls of all academic abilities aged 11–17 years. It has been at the forefront of girls&#x27; education for over 95 years and has its origins in Whitelands College School which was founded in 1842. When that school was threatened with closure Lady Margaret was established in September 1917 by the redoubtable Miss Enid Moberly Bell. The borough is also home to two prestigious independent girls&#x27; schools – St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School in Brook Green (often ranked in first place in the country in league tables, with nearly 50% of each year group gaining entry to Oxbridge), and the Godolphin and Latymer School, situated a few minutes&#x27; walk from Hammersmith Broadway.

The London Oratory School is a leading Roman Catholic secondary school in East Fulham.

Latymer Upper School, an independent co-educational school, is also in the borough, on King Street in Hammersmith.

==Freedom of the Borough==
The following people and military units have received the Freedom of the Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham.

==Swaps controversy==

In June 1988 the Audit Commission was tipped off by someone working on the swaps desk of Goldman Sachs that the Borough had a massive exposure to interest rate swaps. When the commission contacted the council, the chief executive told them not to worry as &quot;everybody knows that interest rates are going to fall&quot;; the treasurer thought the interest rate swaps were a &quot;nice little earner&quot;. The Commission&#x27;s Controller, Howard Davies, realised that the council had put all of its positions on interest rates going down and ordered an investigation.

By January 1989 the Commission obtained legal opinions from two Queen&#x27;s Counsel. Although they did not agree, the commission preferred the opinion that it was &quot;ultra vires&quot; for councils to engage in interest rate swaps (ie. that they had no lawful power to do so). Moreover, interest rates had increased from 8% to 15%. The auditor and the commission then went to court and had the contracts declared void (appeals all the way up to the House of Lords failed in &quot;Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC&quot;); the five banks involved lost millions of pounds. Many other local authorities had been engaging in interest rate swaps in the 1980s. This resulted in several cases in which the banks generally lost their claims for compound interest on debts to councils, finalised in &quot;Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council&quot;. Banks did, however, recover some funds where the derivatives were &quot;in the money&quot; for the Councils (ie, an asset showing a profit for the council, which it now had to return to the bank, not a debt).

The controversy surrounding interest rate swaps reached a peak in the UK during the financial crisis where banks sold unsuitable interest rate hedging products on a large scale to SMEs. The practice has been widely criticised by the media and Parliament.

<doc id="95391" wikidata="Q208152" url="?curid=95391" title="London Borough of Tower Hamlets">
<text>The London Borough of Tower Hamlets is a borough in London, England. Situated on the north bank of the River Thames and immediately east of the City of London, the borough spans much of the traditional East End of London and includes much of the regenerated London Docklands area. The 2019 mid-year population for the borough is estimated at 324,745.

The borough was formed in 1965 by merger of the former metropolitan boroughs of Stepney, Poplar, and Bethnal Green. &#x27;Tower Hamlets&#x27; was originally an alternative name for the historic Tower Division; the area of south-east Middlesex, focused on (but not limited to) the area of the modern borough, which owed military service to the Tower of London. The Tower of London itself is located in the borough, adjacent to its western boundary with the City of London.

The local authority is Tower Hamlets London Borough Council. In 2017, a joint study by Trust for London and New Policy Institute found Tower Hamlets to be the 2nd most deprived London borough (after Barking and Dagenham) based on an average calculated across a range of indicators; with high rates of poverty, child poverty, unemployment and pay inequality compared to other London boroughs. However, it has the lowest gap for educational outcomes at secondary level.

Some of the tallest buildings in London occupy Canary Wharf, one of the country&#x27;s largest financial districts, in the southeast of the borough. Between 2014 and 2024, Tower Hamlets saw the completion of 71 skyscrapers, more than any other London borough. Also, part of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park is in the borough.

Demographically, Tower Hamlets has a large population of British Bangladeshis, forming the largest single ethnic group in the borough at 32%. The 2011 census showed Tower Hamlets to have the highest proportion of Muslims of any English local authority and was the only location where Muslims outnumbered Christians. The borough has more than 40 mosques, Islamic centres and madrasahs, including the East London Mosque, Britain&#x27;s largest. Whitechapel and Brick Lane&#x27;s restaurants, neighbouring street market and shops provide the largest range of Bangladeshi cuisine, woodwork, carpets and clothes in Europe. Brick Lane is also a major centre of hipster subculture.

==History==


The earliest reference to the name &quot;Tower Hamlets&quot; was in 1554, when the Council of the Tower of London ordered a muster of &quot;men of the hamlets which owe their service to the tower&quot;. This covered a wider area than the present-day borough, and its military relationship with the Tower is thought to have been several centuries earlier than the 1554 record.

In 1605, the Lieutenant of the Tower was given the right to muster the militia and the area east of the tower came to be a distinct military unit, officially called Tower Hamlets (or the Tower Division). The Hamlets of the Tower paid taxes for the militia in 1646.

The London Borough of Tower Hamlets forms the core of the East End. The population of the area grew enormously in the 19th century, leading to extreme overcrowding and a concentration of poor people and immigrants throughout the area. These problems were exacerbated by the construction of St Katharine Docks (1827) and the central London railway termini (1840–1875) with many displaced people moving into the area following the clearance of former slums and rookeries. Over the course of a century, the East End became synonymous with poverty, overcrowding, disease and criminality.

The area was once characterised by rural settlements clustered around the City walls or along the main roads, surrounded by farmland, with marshes and small communities by the River, serving the needs of shipping and the Royal Navy. Until the arrival of formal docks, shipping was required to land goods in the Pool of London, but industries related to construction, repair, and victualling of ships flourished in the area from Tudor times. The area attracted large numbers of rural people looking for employment. Successive waves of foreign immigration began with Huguenot refugees creating a new extramural suburb in Spitalfields in the 17th century. They were followed by Irish weavers, Ashkenazi Jews and, in the 20th century, Bangladeshis.
Many of these immigrants worked in the clothing industry. The abundance of semi- and unskilled labour led to low wages and poor conditions throughout the East End. This brought the attentions of social reformers during the mid-18th century and led to the formation of unions and workers associations at the end of the century. The radicalism of the East End contributed to the formation of the Labour Party and demands for the enfranchisement of women.

Official attempts to address the overcrowded housing began at the beginning of the 20th century under the London County Council. Aerial bombing in World War II devastated much of the East End, with its docks, railways and industry forming a continual target. In the separate boroughs making up today&#x27;s Tower Hamlets a total of 2,221 civilians were killed and 7,472 were injured, with 46,482 houses destroyed and 47,574 damaged. This led to some dispersal of the population to outlying suburbs. New housing was built in the 1950s for those that remained.

The closure of the last of the East End docks in the Port of London in 1980 created further challenges and led to attempts at regeneration and the formation of the London Docklands Development Corporation. The Canary Wharf development, improved infrastructure, and the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park mean that the East End is undergoing further change, but some of its districts continue to see some of the worst poverty in Britain.

===Administrative history===
The area of the modern borough had historically been part of the hundred of Ossulstone in county of Middlesex. Ossulstone was subsequently divided into four divisions, one of which was the Tower Division, also known as the Tower Hamlets, which covered a larger area than the modern borough, also including parts of Hackney. From at least the 17th century the Tower Division was a liberty with judicial and administrative independence from the rest of the county. The liberty appears to have arisen from much older obligations on inhabitants of the area to provide military service to the Constable of the Tower of London.

From 1856 the area was governed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, which was established to provide services across the metropolis of London. In 1889 the Metropolitan Board of Works&#x27; area was made the County of London. From 1856 until 1900 the lower tier of local government within the metropolis comprised various parish vestries and district boards. In 1900 the lower tier was reorganised into metropolitan boroughs, including the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green, the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar and the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney.

The modern borough was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963. It was a merger of the old boroughs of Bethnal Green, Poplar and Stepney, and was named Tower Hamlets after the historic liberty.

==Geography==

Tower Hamlets is in East London, north of the River Thames. The City of London lies to the west, the London Borough of Hackney to the north, while the River Lea forms the boundary with the London Borough of Newham to the east. The River Lea also forms the boundary between the historic counties of Middlesex and Essex. The borough&#x27;s Thames frontage extends from the Tower Dock inlet, immediately west of the Tower of London, through several miles of former docklands, including the Isle of Dogs peninsula, to the confluence of the Thames and Lea at Blackwall. Areas along the Thames and Lea flood plains were historically frequently flooded, but the Thames Barrier, further east, has reduced that risk.

Regent&#x27;s Canal enters the borough from Hackney to meet the River Thames at Limehouse Basin. A stretch of the Hertford Union Canal leads from the Regent&#x27;s canal, at a basin in the north of Mile End, to join the River Lea at Old Ford. A further canal, Limehouse Cut, London&#x27;s oldest, leads from locks at Bromley-by-Bow to Limehouse Basin. Most of the canal tow-paths are open to both pedestrians and cyclists.

The borough includes open spaces such as Victoria Park, King Edward Memorial Park, Mile End Park, Island Gardens and part of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.

==Climate==
The data below were taken between 1971 and 2000 at the weather station in Greenwich, around south of the borough&#x27;s former town hall, at Mulberry Place:

==Demographics==

By 1891, Tower Hamlets – roughly the ancient civil parish of Stepney – was already one of the most populated areas in London. Throughout the nineteenth century, the local population increased by an average of 20% every ten years. The building of the docks intensified land use and caused the last marshy areas in the south of the parish to be drained for housing and industry. In the north of the borough, employment was principally in weaving, small household industries like boot and furniture making and new industrial enterprises like Bryant and May. The availability of cheap labour drew in many employers. To the south, employment was in the docks and related industries – such as chandlery and rope making.

By the middle of the nineteenth century, the district now recognised as Tower Hamlets was characterised by overcrowding and poverty. The construction of the railways caused many more displaced people to settle in the area, and a massive influx of Eastern European Jews at the latter part of the nineteenth century added to the population growth. This migration peaked at the end of that century and population growth entered a long decline through to the 1960s, as people moved away eastwards to newer suburbs of London and Essex. The area&#x27;s population had neared 600,000 around the end of the nineteenth century, but fell to a low of less than 140,000 by the early 1980s.

The metropolitan boroughs suffered very badly during World War II, during which considerable numbers of houses were destroyed or damaged beyond use due to heavy aerial bombing. This coincided with a decline in work in the docks, and the closure of many traditional industries. The Abercrombie Plan for London (1944) began an exodus from London towards the new towns.

This decline began to reverse with the establishment of the London Docklands Development Corporation bringing new industries and housing to the brownfield sites along the river. Also contributing was new immigration from Asia beginning in the 1970s. According to the 2001 UK Census the population of the borough is approximately 196,106. According to the ONS estimate, the population is 237,900, as of 2010.

Crime in the borough increased by 3.5% from 2009 to 2010, according to figures from the Metropolitan Police, having decreased by 24% between 2003/04 and 2007/08.

Tower Hamlets has one of the smallest White British populations of any local authority in the United Kingdom. No ethnic group forms a majority of the population; a plurality of residents are white (45%), a little over two thirds of whom are White British. 32% of residents are Bangladeshi, which is the largest ethnic minority group in the borough, with Asians as a whole forming 41% of the population. A smaller proportion are of Black African and Caribbean descent (7%), with Somalis representing the second-largest minority ethnic group. Those of mixed ethnic backgrounds form 4%, while other ethnic groups form 2%. The White British proportion was recorded as 31.2% in the 2011 UK Census, a decrease from 42.9% in 2001.

In 2018, Tower Hamlets had the lowest life expectancy and the highest rate of heart disease of all London boroughs, along with Newham.

The 2021 census found that the borough has one of the lowest proportions of population over the age of 65 or older in England and Wales, at 5.6%.

===Ethnicity===

==Religion and religious sites==

Tower Hamlets is a religious diverse borough with various places of worship. 
According to the 2021 census, 39.9% of the population was Muslim, 22.3% Christian, 2.0% Hindu, 1.0% Buddhist, 0.4% Jewish, 0.3% Sikh, 0.5% followed some other religion, 26.6% were not affiliated to a religion and 6.9% did not state their religious views.

The following table shows the religious identity of residents residing in Tower Hamlets according to the 2001, 2011 and the 2021 censuses.

===Places of worship===

There are 21 active churches, affiliated with the Church of England, which include Christ Church of Spitalfields, St Paul&#x27;s Church of Shadwell and St Dunstan&#x27;s of Stepney; and there are also churches of many other Christian denominations.

There are more than 40 mosques and Islamic centres in Tower Hamlets. The most famous is the East London Mosque, one of the first mosques in Britain allowed to broadcast the adhan, and one of the biggest Islamic centres in Europe. The Maryam Centre, a part of the mosque, is the biggest Islamic centre for women in Europe. Opened in 2013, it features a main prayer hall, ameliorated funeral services, education facilities, a fitness centre and support services.
The East London Mosque has been visited by several notable people, including Prince Charles, Boris Johnson, many foreign government officials and world-renowned imams and Muslim scholars. Other notable mosques are Brick Lane Mosque, Darul Ummah Masjid, Esha Atul Islam Mosque, Markazi Masjid, Stepney Shahjalal Mosque and Poplar Central Mosque.

Other notable religious buildings include the Fieldgate Street Great Synagogue, the Congregation of Jacob Synagogue, the London Buddhist Centre, the Hindu Pragati Sangha Temple, and the Gurdwara Sikh Sangat. The Great Synagogue of London, which was destroyed during the Second World War, is located just outside the borough&#x27;s boundaries, in the City.

==Economy==
The borough hosts the world headquarters of many global financial businesses, employing some of the highest paid workers in London, but also has high rates of long-term illness and premature death and the 2nd highest unemployment rate in London.

Canary Wharf is home to the many of the world and European headquarters of numerous major banks and professional services firms including Barclays, Citigroup, Clifford Chance, Credit Suisse, Infosys, Fitch Ratings, HSBC, J.P. Morgan, KPMG, MetLife, Morgan Stanley, RBC, Skadden, State Street and Thomson Reuters. Savills, a top-end estate agency recommends that &#x27;extreme luxury&#x27; and ultra-modern residential properties are to be found at Canary Riverside, West India Quay, Pan Peninsula and Neo Bankside. Tower Hamlets is the earliest borough where the first skyscrapers were built and since 2014 it saw the completion of over seventy skyscrapers, more than any other place in the UK 

The End Child Poverty coalition published that Tower Hamlets has the highest proportion of children in poverty of any local authority in the UK at 49% (and as high as 54.5% in the Bethnal Green South ward).

Surveys and interviews conducted by the Child Poverty Action group for the council found that the Universal Credit system was deeply unpopular with low-income families in the borough and that most claimants who have used the system found it difficult to understand and experienced frequent payment errors.

==Media==
The &quot;East London Advertiser&quot; and &quot;Social Streets&quot; provide local news in print and online. There are also several Bengali print and online newspapers published in the borough.

==Education==
The London Borough of Tower Hamlets is the local education authority for state schools within the borough. In January 2008, there were 19,890 primary-school pupils and 15,262 secondary-school pupils attending state schools there. Private-school pupils account for 2.4 per cent of schoolchildren in the borough. In 2010, 51.8 per cent of pupils achieved 5 A*–C GCSEs including Mathematics and English – the highest results in the borough&#x27;s history – compared to the national average of 53.4 per cent. Seventy-four per cent achieved 5 A*–C GCSEs for all subjects (the same as the English average); the figure in 1997 was 26 per cent. The percentage of pupils on free school meals in the borough is the highest in England and Wales. In 2007, the council rejected proposals to build a Goldman Sachs-sponsored academy.

Schools in the borough have high levels of racial segregation. &quot;The Times&quot; reported in 2006 that 47 per cent of secondary schools were exclusively non-white, and that 33 per cent had a white majority. About 60 per cent of pupils entering primary and secondary school are Bangladeshi. 78% of primary-school pupils speak English as a second language.
The council runs several Idea Stores in the borough, which combine traditional library and computer services with other resources, and are designed to attract more diverse members. The flagship Whitechapel store was designed by David Adjaye, and cost £16 million to build.

A leisure centre including a swimming pool at Mile End Stadium was completed in 2006. Other pools are located at St Georges, Limehouse and York Hall, in Bethnal Green. York Hall is also a regular venue for boxing tournaments, and in May 2007 a public spa was opened in the building&#x27;s renovated Victorian-style Turkish baths.

===Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park===
Tower Hamlets was one of five host boroughs for the 2012 Summer Olympics; the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park was constructed in the Lea Valley. As such, the borough&#x27;s involvement in the Olympics includes:

* A small part of the Olympic Park is in Bow, a district of the borough, which makes the borough a host borough. 
* The energy centre (King&#x27;s Yard Energy Centre) of the Olympic Park is in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, and gives energy to all the venues, none of which are located in Tower Hamlets. 
* The world square and the London 2012 mega-store is also in the borough. The world square is for spectators, who can buy food or drink; the world&#x27;s biggest McDonald&#x27;s is in the world square in Tower Hamlets. 
* The London 2012 mega-store provides official gifts and souvenirs. High Street, which is the main road to the Olympic park from west and central London, combines Whitechapel Road, Mile End Road and Bow Road. 
* Victoria Park, in Tower Hamlets, is an important part of the Olympics because spectators without tickets can watch the games on big screens (London live 2012); that park is less than a mile away from the Olympic park. The main spectator cycle park is located in Victoria park. One of the entrances to the Olympic park is in Tower Hamlets, and is called the Victoria gate.
* A few schools in Tower Hamlets have taken part in the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympic and Paralympic games as well as all the other host boroughs. The section of the Olympic Park in Tower Hamlets will be named &quot;Sweetwater&quot;, one of the 5 new neighbourhoods after the games. Sweetwater will cover Tower Hamlets&#x27; part of the Olympic Park near Old Ford. 
* The Olympic marathon was planned to run through the borough but later ran through the City and Westminster. However, the U-turn was located in the borough near The Tower of London.
* Danny Boyle, the artistic director of the London 2012 opening ceremony, lives in Mile End.
* A large number of Tower Hamlets&#x27; residents became Olympic volunteers; Tower Hamlets ranks second, after neighbouring borough Newham, for the number of volunteers from the borough.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of the Borough of Tower Hamlets was granted by the College of Arms in 1965 and is composed of elements representing the maritime trades and heritage of the area. The strong links to the former manor and ancient parish of Stepney and to St Dunstan&#x27;s church in Stepney known as the &quot;Church of the High Seas&quot; are represented. The manor and parish did not have a coat of arms but the (smaller) subsequent Metropolitan Borough of Stepney did, and elements from that have been incorporated into the current design.

The shield features:
* A ship, representing the maritime trades.
* A sprig of mulberry and a weaver&#x27;s shuttle, representing the silk and other weaving activities once so important to the borough. The use of mulberry also honours the Huguenot refugees who first brought silk weaving to Tower Hamlets, and to England generally. Many council staff wear mulberry coloured (claret\maroon) uniforms.
* Blacksmith&#x27;s fire tongs, the emblem of St Dunstan, the patron saint of Stepney, who had close ties to the area. Dunstan famously grabbed the devil by the nose with his tongs when he tried to tempt Dunstan.
The crest features:
* A silver representation of the (originally whitewashed) White Tower of the Tower of London, to which the original Tower Hamlets (or Tower division) was intimately linked.
* Crossed gold anchors, again representing the area&#x27;s position in the Port of London.
Supporters:
* A seahorse, representing the maritime trades.
* A talbot dog, representing the Isle of Dogs.
Motto: &quot;From great things to greater&quot;, an anglicised version of the Latin motto on the arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney.

The council&#x27;s logo is used as an alternative to the coat of arms. It features a simplified White Tower, above a stylised representation of the Thames. This was a development of the previous logo of the White Tower, in mulberry and presented in a three-tower form, as if seen from certain quarters which obscured the furthest corner tower—and a geographically accurate representation of the local part of the Thames. This older version is still seen on many street signs.

==Freedom of the Borough==

<text>Debden is a small rural village in the Uttlesford district of Essex in the East of England. It is located 4 miles (6 km) from Saffron Walden and 17 miles (27 km) from Cambridge.

RAF Debden is nearby and played a role in the Second World War.

Since 2007 the village has shared twin status with the village of Tang Ting in rural Nepal.

==History==
The village was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Depeduna&quot; (deep valley), and became known as Debden at the time of the Napoleonic Wars.

After the Norman conquest the manor of Debden was granted to Ralph Peverel, but reverted to the crown after Peverel&#x27;s grandson, William Peverel the Younger, poisoned the Earl of Chester. King John later granted the manor to Geoffrey Fitzpeter, 1st Earl of Essex and it descended in that family until becoming Crown land again. Henry VIII granted it to Lord Audley, from whom it descended to his grandson, Thomas Howard, Baron Howard de Walden and Earl of Suffolk. It was acquired in 1715 by wealthy merchant Richard Chiswell, MP and remained in the Chiswell family for some 100 years. It then passed by marriage to the Vincent family who held it until 1882 when Mrs Cely-Trevilian, the last member of the family, sold it to William Fuller-Maitland of Stansted Mountfitchet Hall. By the First World War it had come into the possession of Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal. Later owners found Debden Hall too expensive to maintain, and so the house was demolished and part of the estate sold off in 1935.

The Church of England Parish Church of St Mary the Virgin and All Saints is Grade I listed. A flint and stone church is 13th century but with considerable 18th-century restoration and rebuilding after the 1698 fall of the central tower which destroyed the chancel. The clerestorey and chancel were rebuilt in 1793 when the west bell turret, spire and parapets of the nave and aisles were probably added. The restoration and rebuilding was done by Richard Muilman Trench Chiswell of Debden Hall, whose elaborate tomb in the chancel was designed by John Carter.

<text>Edmonton is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated on the North Saskatchewan River and is the centre of the Edmonton Metropolitan Region, which is surrounded by Alberta&#x27;s central region. It anchors the northern end of what Statistics Canada defines as the &quot;Calgary–Edmonton Corridor&quot;.

The area that later became the city of Edmonton was first inhabited by First Nations peoples and was also a historic site for the Métis. By 1795, many trading posts had been established around the area that later became the Edmonton census metropolitan area. &quot;Fort Edmonton&quot;, as it was known, became the main centre for trade in the area after the 1821 merger of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the North West Company. It remained sparsely populated until the Canadian acquisition of Rupert&#x27;s Land in 1870, followed eventually by the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1891, its inauguration as a city in 1904, and its designation as the capital of the new province of Alberta in 1906. Its growth was facilitated through the absorption of five adjacent urban municipalities (Strathcona, North Edmonton, West Edmonton, Beverly and Jasper Place) in addition to a series of annexations through 1982, and the annexation of of land from Leduc County and the City of Beaumont on January 1, 2019.

As of 2021, Edmonton had a city population of 1,010,899 and a metropolitan population of 1,418,118, making it the fifth-largest city and sixth-largest metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada. It is the northernmost city and metropolitan area in North America to have a population of over one million. Residents are called &quot;Edmontonians&quot;.

Known as the &quot;Gateway to the North&quot; outside of Ontario, Edmonton has become a staging point for large-scale oil sands projects occurring in northern Alberta and large-scale diamond mining operations in the Northwest Territories. It is a cultural, governmental and educational centre that hosts festivals year-round, reflected in the nickname &quot;Canada&#x27;s Festival City&quot;. It is home to Canada&#x27;s largest mall, West Edmonton Mall (the world&#x27;s largest mall from 1981 until 2004); and Fort Edmonton Park, Canada&#x27;s largest living history museum.

== Etymology ==
Established as the first permanent settlement in the area of what is now Edmonton, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trading post of Fort Edmonton (also known as Edmonton House) was named after Edmonton, Middlesex, England. The fort&#x27;s name was chosen by William Tomison, who was in charge of its construction, taking the fort&#x27;s namesake from the hometown of the Lake family – at least five of whom were influential members of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company between 1696 and 1807. In turn, the name of Edmonton derives from Adelmetone, meaning &#x27;farmstead/estate of Ēadhelm&#x27; (from Ēadhelm, an Old English personal name, and ); this earlier form of the name appears in the Domesday Book of 1086. Fort Edmonton was also called &quot;Fort-des-Prairies&quot; by French-Canadians, trappers, and coureurs des bois.

Indigenous languages refer to the Edmonton area by multiple names which reference the presence of fur trading posts. In Cree, the area is known as , which translates to &quot;Beaver Hills House&quot; and references the location&#x27;s proximity to the Beaver Hills east of Edmonton. In Blackfoot, the area is known as ; in Nakota Sioux, the area is known as ; in Tsuutʼina, the area is known as (anglicised as &quot;Nasagachoo&quot;). The Blackfoot name translates to &#x27;big lodge&#x27;, while the Nakota Sioux and Tsuutʼina names translate to &#x27;big house&#x27;. In Denesuline, the area is known as , a metonymic toponym which also generally means &#x27;city&#x27;.

== History ==

The earliest known inhabitants arrived in the area that is now Edmonton around 3,000 BC and perhaps as early as 12,000 BC when an ice-free corridor opened as the last glacial period ended and timber, water, and wildlife became available in the region.

The site of present-day Edmonton was home to several First Nations peoples, including the Cree, Nakota Sioux, Blackfoot, Tsuut&#x27;ina, Ojibwe, and Denesuline. The valley of the North Saskatchewan River, in particular the area of Edmonton, was settled to varying degrees for thousands of years, and provided many essential resources, including fish, medicine, and materials for tool making, such as chert or quartzite, which are abundant in the area around the modern city and which can be easily knapped into tools such as axes, knives, and arrowheads.

The city was also a historic site for the Métis, who held many narrow lots along the North Saskatchewan which gave access to resources in the area. By 1882, these lots numbered about 44, after which they were displaced and integrated into the expanding city of Edmonton.
In 1754, Anthony Henday, an explorer for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC), may have been the first European to enter the Edmonton area. His expeditions across the Prairies of Rupert&#x27;s Land were mainly to seek contact with the Indigenous population for establishing the fur trade, as the competition was fierce between the HBC and the North West Company (NWC).

By 1795, Fort Edmonton was established on the river&#x27;s north bank as a major trading post for the HBC, near the mouth of the Sturgeon River close to present-day Fort Saskatchewan. Fort Edmonton was built within &quot;musket-shot range&quot; of the rival NWC&#x27;s Fort Augustus. Although both forts were initially successful, declines in beaver pelt hauls and firewood stocks forced both HBC and NWC to move their forts upstream.

By 1813, after some changes in location, Fort Edmonton was established in the area of what is now Rossdale, beginning Edmonton&#x27;s start as a permanent population centre. The fort was located on the border of territory that was disputed by the Blackfoot and Cree nations. Furthermore, the fort intersected territory patrolled by the Blackfoot Confederacy to the South, and the Cree, Dene, and Nakoda nations to the north. After the NWC merged with the HBC, Fort Augustus was closed in favour of Fort Edmonton.

In 1876, Treaty 6, which includes what is now Edmonton, was signed between First Nations and the Crown, as part of the Numbered Treaties. The agreement includes the Plains and Woods Cree, Assiniboine, and other band governments of First Nations at Fort Carlton, Fort Pitt, and Battle River. The area covered by the treaty represents most of the central area of the current provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.

The coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) to southern Alberta in 1885 helped the Edmonton economy, and the 1891 building of the Calgary and Edmonton (C&amp;E) Railway resulted in the emergence of a railway townsite (South Edmonton/Strathcona) on the river&#x27;s south side, across from Edmonton. The arrival of the CPR and the C&amp;E Railway helped bring settlers and entrepreneurs from eastern Canada, Europe, the U.S. and other parts of the world. The Edmonton area&#x27;s fertile soil and cheap land attracted settlers, further establishing Edmonton as a major regional commercial and agricultural centre. Some people participating in the Klondike Gold Rush passed through South Edmonton/Strathcona in 1897. Strathcona was North America&#x27;s northernmost railway point, but travel to the Klondike was still very difficult for the &quot;Klondikers&quot;, and a majority of them took a steamship north to the Yukon from Vancouver, British Columbia.

Incorporated as a town in 1892 with a population of 700 and then as a city in 1904 with a population of 8,350, Edmonton became the capital of Alberta when the province was formed a year later, on September 1, 1905. In November 1905, the Canadian Northern Railway (CNR) arrived in Edmonton, accelerating growth.

During the early 1900s, Edmonton&#x27;s rapid growth led to speculation in real estate. In 1912, Edmonton amalgamated with the City of Strathcona south of the North Saskatchewan River; as a result, the city held land on both banks of the North Saskatchewan River for the first time.

Just before World War I, the boom ended, and the city&#x27;s population declined from more than 72,000 in 1914 to less than 54,000 only two years later. Many impoverished families moved to subsistence farms outside the city, while others fled to greener pastures in other provinces. Recruitment to the army during the war also contributed to the drop in population. Afterwards, the city slowly recovered in population and economy during the 1920s and 1930s and took off again during and after World War II.

The Edmonton City Centre Airport opened in 1929, becoming Canada&#x27;s first licensed airfield. Originally named Blatchford Field in honour of former mayor Kenny Blatchford, pioneering aviators such as Wilfrid R. &quot;Wop&quot; May and Max Ward used Blatchford Field as a major base for distributing mail, food, and medicine to Northern Canada; hence Edmonton&#x27;s emergence as the &quot;Gateway to the North&quot;. World War II saw Edmonton become a major base for the construction of the Alaska Highway and the Northwest Staging Route. The airport was closed in November 2013.

On July 31, 1987, an F4 tornado hit the city and killed 27 people. The storm hit the areas of Beaumont, Mill Woods, Bannerman, Fraser, and Evergreen. The day became known as &quot;Black Friday&quot; and earned the city the moniker &quot;City of Champions&quot;.

=== History of municipal governance ===

In 1892, Edmonton was incorporated as a town. The first mayor was Matthew McCauley, who established the first school board in Edmonton and Board of Trade (later Chamber of Commerce) and a municipal police service. Due to McCauley&#x27;s good relationship with the federal Liberals, Edmonton maintained economic and political prominence over Strathcona, a rival town on the south side of the North Saskatchewan River. Edmonton was incorporated as a city in 1904 and became Alberta&#x27;s capital in 1905.

In 1904, the City of Edmonton purchased the Edmonton District Telephone Company for $17,000 from Alex Taylor, a Canadian entrepreneur, inventor, and politician. Amalgamated into a city department as City of Edmonton Telephone Department, City Telephone System (CTS), &#x27;Edmonton telephones&#x27;. In 1989, City Council voted to create Edmonton Telephones Corporation (Ed Tel) to operate as an autonomous organization under a board of directors appointed by the city. In 1995, City of Edmonton ownership of its telephone service ended when Ed Tel was sold to the Telus corporation. City Bylaw 11713 created The Ed Tel Endowment Fund whereas the shares owned by Edmonton Telephones Corporation in Ed Tel Inc. were sold by the City of Edmonton to Telus on March 10, 1995, for $470,221,872 to be invested for the perpetual benefit of Edmontonians.

Unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World struggled for progressive social change through the early years, with the first reformer, James East, elected in 1912, followed by the first official Labour alderman, James Kinney, the following year. Many thousands of workers participated in the Edmonton general strike of 1919 and a strong block of Labour representatives were on council after the next election: East, Kinney, Sam McCoppen, Rice Sheppard and Joe Clarke.

Labour representation on city council became a near-majority in 1929, and a full majority from 1932 to 1934, during the Great Depression. Jan Reimer became the city&#x27;s first female mayor when she was elected in 1989.

In 2021, Amarjeet Sohi became the first person of colour to be elected as mayor of Edmonton.

== Geography ==
Edmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River, at an elevation of . It is North America&#x27;s northernmost city with a population over one million. It is south of Alberta&#x27;s geographic centre, which is near the Hamlet of Fort Assiniboine. The terrain in and around Edmonton is generally flat to gently rolling, with ravines and deep river valleys, such as the North Saskatchewan River valley. The Canadian Rockies are west of Edmonton and about to the southwest.

The North Saskatchewan River originates at the Columbia Icefield in Jasper National Park and bisects the city. It sometimes floods Edmonton&#x27;s river valley, most notably in the North Saskatchewan River flood of 1915. It empties via the Saskatchewan River, Lake Winnipeg, and the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. It runs from the southwest to the northeast and is fed by numerous creeks throughout the city, including Mill Creek, Whitemud Creek and Blackmud Creek; these creeks have created ravines, some of which are used for urban parkland. Edmonton is within the Canadian Prairies Ecozone.

Aspen parkland surrounds the city and is a transitional area from the prairies to the south and boreal forest in the north. The aspen woods and forests in and around Edmonton have long since been reduced by farming and residential and commercial developments including oil and natural gas exploration.

=== Climate ===

Edmonton has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;, Trewartha climate classification &quot;Dcbc&quot;) with typically cold, dry winters and warm, sunny summers, prone to extremes and large swings at all times of the year. It falls into the NRC 4a Plant Hardiness Zone.

Summer in Edmonton lasts from June until early September, while winter lasts from November until March and in common with all of Alberta varies greatly in length and severity. Spring and autumn are both short and highly variable. Edmonton&#x27;s growing season on average lasts from May 9 to September 22; having an average 135–140 frost-free days each year, resulting in one of the longest growing seasons on the Canadian Prairies. At the summer solstice, Edmonton receives 17 hours and three minutes of daylight, with an hour and 46 minutes of civil twilight, and on average receives 2,344 hours of bright sunshine per year, making it one of Canada&#x27;s sunniest cities.

The city is known for having cold winters, though its weather is milder than Regina, Saskatoon or Winnipeg, all of which are on a more southerly latitude than Edmonton. Its average daily temperatures range from a low of in January to a summer peak of in July, with average maximum of in July and minimum of in January. Temperatures can exceed for an average of four to five afternoons anytime from late April to mid-September and fall below for an average of 24.6 days in the winter. The highest temperature recorded in Edmonton was on June 29, 1937 and on July 2, 2013, a record high humidex of 44 was recorded due to an unusually humid day with a temperature of and a record high dew point of . The lowest temperature ever recorded in Edmonton was on January 19 and 21, 1886.

Edmonton has a fairly dry climate, receiving of precipitation per year, of which is rain and is the melt from from snowfall. Over 75% of the average annual precipitation falls in the late spring, summer, and early autumn, with the wettest month being July, having a mean precipitation of , and the driest months being February, March, October, November and December. Significant snowfall accumulation typically begins in late October and tapers off by late March. Dry spells are not uncommon and may occur at any time of the year. Extremes do occur, such as the of rainfall that fell on July 31, 1953. Much of the precipitation that Edmonton receives in the summer comes from late-day thunderstorms, which are frequent and occasionally severe enough to produce large hail, damaging winds, funnel clouds, and tornadoes.

The summer of 2006 was particularly warm for Edmonton, as temperatures reached or higher more than 20 times from mid-May to early September. Later, the summer of 2021 saw the temperature rise above on 23 days between June and August, while nearly breaking the record high temperature on June 30 with a temperature of . The winter of 2011–12 was particularly warm: from December 22 through March 20 there were 53 occasions when Edmonton saw temperatures at or above at the City Centre Airport, and even warmer in the city proper.

A massive cluster of thunderstorms swept through Edmonton on July 11, 2004, with large hail and over of rain reported within an hour in many places. This &quot;1-in-200 year event&quot; flooded major intersections and underpasses and damaged both residential and commercial properties. The storm caused extensive damage to West Edmonton Mall; a small glass section of the roof collapsed under the weight of the rainwater, causing water to drain onto the mall&#x27;s indoor ice rink. As a result, the mall was evacuated as a precautionary measure.

Twelve tornadoes had been recorded in Edmonton between 1890 and 1989, and eight since 1990. An F4 tornado that struck Edmonton on July 31, 1987, killing 27, was unusual in many respects, including severity, duration, damage, and casualties. It is commonly referred to as &quot;Black Friday&quot; due both to its aberrant characteristics and the emotional shock it generated. Then-mayor Laurence Decore cited the community&#x27;s response to the tornado as evidence that Edmonton was a &quot;city of champions,&quot; which later became an unofficial slogan of the city.


=== Metropolitan area ===

Edmonton is at the centre of Canada&#x27;s sixth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA), which includes Edmonton and 34 other municipalities in the surrounding area. Larger urban communities include Sherwood Park (an urban service area within Strathcona County), the cities of St. Albert, Beaumont, Leduc, Spruce Grove and Fort Saskatchewan, and the towns of Stony Plain, Morinville, and Devon. Major employment areas outside Edmonton but within the CMA include the Nisku Industrial Business Park and the Edmonton International Airport (including a planned inland port logistics support facility in support of the Port Alberta initiative) in Leduc County, the Acheson Industrial Area in Parkland County, Refinery Row in Strathcona County and Alberta&#x27;s Industrial Heartland within portions of Fort Saskatchewan, Strathcona County and Sturgeon County. Alberta&#x27;s Industrial Heartland also extends beyond the CMA&#x27;s northeastern boundary into Lamont County.

The individual economic development interests and costs of service delivery in certain municipalities within the region have led to intermunicipal competition, strained intermunicipal relationships and overall fragmentation of the region. Although several attempts have been made by the City of Edmonton to absorb surrounding municipalities or annex portions of its neighbours, the city has not absorbed another municipality since the Town of Jasper Place joined Edmonton on August 17, 1964, and the city has not annexed land from any of its neighbours since January 1, 1982. After years of mounting pressure in the early 21st century, the Province of Alberta formed the Capital Region Board (CRB) on April 15, 2008. The CRB consists of 24 member municipalities – 22 of which are within the Edmonton CMA and two of which are outside the CMA. The City of Edmonton announced in March 2013 its intent to annex 156 square kilometres of land (including the Edmonton International Airport) from Leduc County.

On November 30, 2016, the City of Edmonton and Leduc County came to an agreement on Edmonton&#x27;s annexation proposal. The City of Edmonton was poised to annex of land from Leduc County and Beaumont, including the Edmonton International Airport, as a result.

On January 1, 2019, the City of Edmonton officially annexed from Leduc County and the City of Beaumont, increasing the city&#x27;s area to , with discussions of annexing an additional of Edmonton International Airport land still ongoing.

===Neighbourhoods===

Edmonton is divided into 375 neighbourhoods within seven geographic sectors – a mature area sector, which includes neighbourhoods that were essentially built out before 1970, and six surrounding suburban sectors.

Edmonton&#x27;s Downtown is within the city&#x27;s mature area or inner city. It and the surrounding Boyle Street, Central McDougall, Cloverdale, Garneau, McCauley, Oliver, Queen Mary Park, Riverdale, Rossdale, Strathcona and University of Alberta form Edmonton&#x27;s Central Core. Oliver and Garneau are the city&#x27;s most populated and most densely populated neighbourhoods respectively. The mature area sector also contains the five former urban municipalities annexed by the city over its history: Beverly, Jasper Place, North Edmonton, Strathcona and West Edmonton (Calder).

Larger residential areas within Edmonton&#x27;s six suburban sectors, each comprising multiple neighbourhoods, include Heritage Valley, Kaskitayo, Riverbend, Terwillegar Heights and Windermere (southwest sector); The Grange, Lewis Farms and West Jasper Place (west sector); Big Lake (northwest sector); Castle Downs, Lake District and The Palisades (north sector); Casselman-Steele Heights, Clareview, Hermitage, Londonderry and Pilot Sound (northeast sector); and Ellerslie, The Meadows, Mill Woods and Southeast Edmonton (southeast sector). Mill Woods is divided into a town centre community (Mill Woods Town Centre) and eight surrounding communities: Burnewood, Knottwood, Lakewood, Millbourne, Millhurst, Ridgewood, Southwood, and Woodvale. Each has between two and four neighbourhoods.

Several transit-oriented developments (TOD) have begun to appear along the LRT line at Clareview, with future developments planned at Belvedere (part of the Old Town Fort Road Redevelopment Project). Another TOD, Century Park, is being constructed at the site of what was once Heritage Mall, at the southern end of the LRT line. Century Park will eventually house up to 5,000 residents.

The Edmonton City Centre Airport is being redeveloped into a sustainable community of 30,000 people called Blatchford, comprising a transit-oriented mixed use town centre, townhouses, low, medium and high rise apartments, neighbourhood retail and service uses, renewable energy, district heating and cooling, and a major park. The first residents moved into Blatchford in November 2020.

Edmonton has four major industrial districts: the Northwest Industrial District, the Northeast Industrial District, the Southeast Industrial District, and the emerging Edmonton Energy and Technology Park, which is part of Alberta&#x27;s Industrial Heartland. The northwest, northeast and southeast districts each have smaller industrial areas and neighbourhoods within them.

The city has established 12 business revitalization zones: 124 Street and Area, Alberta Avenue, Beverly, Downtown, Chinatown and Little Italy, Fort Road and Area, Inglewood, Kingsway, North Edge, Northwest Industrial, Old Strathcona and Stony Plain Road.

Additionally, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are served by the Edmonton Alberta Temple. Edmonton also hosts a Maronite Catholic church.

In the 1930s, the local Muslim community began organizing to build a mosque. A local Muslim woman, Hilwie Hamdon, met with the mayor to acquire the land, and campaigned to raise $5,000 for the building. In 1938, Abdullah Yusuf Ali was present at the opening of the new Al-Rashid Mosque, which became the first mosque established in Canada and the third in North America. In the 1980s, Muslim students at the University of Alberta found it difficult to rent prayer rooms large enough to accommodate the local population, and opened the Muslim Community of Edmonton as a mosque and outreach centre in 1992. From these beginnings, Muslims now form the city&#x27;s largest religious minority, with 83,015 members (2021) representing over 62 ethnic backgrounds at over 20 Edmonton-area mosques (2019).

Edmonton&#x27;s Jewish community is represented by the Jewish Federation of Edmonton, operating the historic Edmonton Jewish Cemetery, purchased in 1907. The city contains six synagogues.

== Economy ==

Edmonton is the major economic centre for northern and central Alberta and a major centre for the oil and gas industry. As of 2014, the estimated value of major projects within the Edmonton Metropolitan Region was $57.8-billion, of which $34.4-billion are within the oil and gas, oil sands, and pipeline sectors.

Edmonton traditionally has been a hub for Albertan petrochemical industries, earning it the nickname &quot;Oil Capital of Canada&quot; in the 1940s. Supply and service industries drive the energy extraction engine, while research develops new technologies and supports expanded value-added processing of Alberta&#x27;s massive oil, gas, and oil sands reserves. These are reported to be the second-largest in the world, after Saudi Arabia.

Much of the growth in technology sectors is due to Edmonton&#x27;s reputation as one of Canada&#x27;s premier research and education centres. Research initiatives are anchored by educational institutions such as the University of Alberta (U of A) as well as government initiatives underway at Alberta Innovates and Edmonton Research Park. The U of A campus is home to the National Institute for Nanotechnology.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Edmonton became a major financial centre, with both regional offices of Canada&#x27;s major banks and locally based institutions opening. The turmoil of the late-1980s economy radically changed the situation. Locally based operations such as Principal Trust and Canadian Commercial Bank would fail, and some regional offices were moved to other cities. The 1990s saw a solidification of the economy, and Edmonton is now home to Canadian Western Bank, the only publicly traded Schedule I chartered bank headquarters west of Toronto. Other major financial institutions include Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), ATB Financial, Servus Credit Union (formerly Capital City Savings), TD Canada Trust and Manulife Financial.

Edmonton has been the birthplace of several companies that have grown to international stature. The local retail market has also seen the creation of many successful store concepts, such as The Brick, Katz Group, AutoCanada, Boston Pizza, Pizza 73, Liquor Stores GP (which includes Liquor Depot, Liquor Barn, OK Liquor, and Grapes &amp; Grains), Planet Organic, Shaw Communications, Empire Design, Running Room, Booster Juice, Earl&#x27;s, Fountain Tire and XS Cargo. Bioware, a video game developer owned by American Publisher Electronic Arts, is also based in Edmonton.

Edmonton&#x27;s geographical location has made it an ideal spot for distribution and logistics. CN Rail&#x27;s North American operational facility is located in the city, as well as a major intermodal facility that handles all incoming freight from the port of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. In early 2020, CN Rail announced that it was closing its Montreal control centre and would eventually close its Vancouver control centre as well, with a goal to consolidate all of its control operations into Edmonton.

===Retail===
Edmonton is home to several shopping malls and the second largest mall in North America, West Edmonton Mall, which is also considered to be the 10th largest mall in the world. Other mentionable malls include Bonnie Doon Shopping Centre, Edmonton City Centre (a combination of the former Edmonton Centre and Eaton Centre malls), Southgate Centre, Kingsway Mall, Northgate Centre, Riverview Crossing, Londonderry Mall, and Mill Woods Town Centre.

Edmonton also has many big box shopping centres and power centres. Some of the major ones include South Edmonton Common (one of North America&#x27;s largest open air retail developments), RioCan Mayfield, Westpoint Centre, Skyview Centre, Terra Losa Centre, Unity Square, SouthPark Centre, The Meadows, Christy&#x27;s Corner, Currents of Windermere, and Manning Village.

In contrast to suburban centres, Edmonton has many urban retail locations. The largest of them all, Old Strathcona, includes many independent stores between 99 Street and 109 Street, on Whyte Avenue and in the surrounding area. Old Strathcona also houses the city&#x27;s largest indoor farmer&#x27;s market with over 130 vendors selling local and regional produce, meat, crafts, and clothing year-round. In and around Downtown Edmonton, there are a few shopping districts, including the Edmonton City Centre mall, Jasper Avenue, and 104 Street. Near Oliver, 124 Street is home to a significant number of retail stores. Edmonton is the Canadian testing ground for many American retailers, such as Bath &amp; Body Works and Calvin Klein.

== Arts and culture ==
Many events are anchored in the downtown Arts District around Churchill Square (named in honour of Sir Winston Churchill). On the south side of the river, the university district and Whyte Avenue contain theatres, concert halls, and various live music venues. The centrepiece of the square builds a life-size bronze statue of Churchill, unveiled by Lady Soames on May 24, 1989. It is a copy of a statue by Oscar Nemon.

=== Performing arts ===
The Francis Winspear Centre for Music opened in 1997 after years of planning and fundraising. Described as one of the most acoustically perfect concert halls in Canada, it is home to the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra and hosts a wide variety of shows every year. It seats 1,932 patrons and houses the $3-million Davis Concert Organ, the largest concert organ in Canada. Across 102 Avenue is the Citadel Theatre, named after The Salvation Army Citadel in which Joe Shoctor first started the Citadel Theatre Company in 1965. It is now one of the largest theatre complexes in Canada, with five halls, each specializing in different kinds of productions. In 2015 the Citadel Theatre also became home to Catalyst Theatre. On the University of Alberta grounds is the 2,534-seat Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium, which had over a year of heavy renovations as part of the province&#x27;s 2005 centennial celebrations. Both it and its southern twin in Calgary were constructed in 1955 for the province&#x27;s golden jubilee and have hosted many concerts, musicals, and ballets. On the front of the building is a quote from Suetonius&#x27; Life of Augustus: &quot;He found a city built of brick – left it built of marble.&quot;

The Old Strathcona neighbourhood is home to the Theatre District, which holds the ATB Financial Arts Barns (headquarters of the Edmonton International Fringe Festival), The Walterdale Playhouse, and the Varscona Theatre (base of operations for several theatre companies, including Teatro la Quindicina, Shadow Theatre, Die-Nasty, Plane Jane Theatre, and Grindstone Theatre!). The Ukrainian Dnipro Ensemble of Edmonton, along with other Ukrainian choirs such as the Ukrainian Male Chorus of Edmonton, helps preserve the Ukrainian musical culture within the parameters of the Canadian multicultural identity in Edmonton.

=== Festivals ===
Edmonton hosts several large festivals each year, contributing to its nickname, &quot;Canada&#x27;s Festival City&quot;. Downtown Edmonton&#x27;s Churchill Square host numerous festivals each summer. The Works Art &amp; Design Festival, which takes place from late June to early July, showcases Canadian and international art and design from well-known award-winning artists as well as emerging and student artists. The Edmonton International Street Performer&#x27;s Festival takes place in mid-July and is the biggest of its kind in North America. The TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival takes place in late June and, along with Montreal, were the first jazz festivals in Canada.

Edmonton&#x27;s main summer festival is K-Days, formerly Klondike Days, Capital Ex and originally the Edmonton Exhibition. Founded in 1879, the Edmonton Exhibition was originally an annual fair and exhibition that eventually adopted a gold rush theme, becoming Klondike Days in the 1960s. Northlands, the operators, renamed the festival &quot;Edmonton&#x27;s Capital Ex&quot; or &quot;Capital Ex&quot; in 2006. In 2012 Edmonton Northlands conducted a poll to rename the festival that resulted in changing the name to &quot;K-Days&quot;. The Canadian Finals Rodeo was held in Edmonton from 1974 to 2017, but moved to Red Deer in 2018 due to the closure of the Northlands Coliseum. It moved back to Edmonton in 2024 and will be held at Rogers Place through 2026.

The Edmonton International Fringe Festival, held in mid-August, is the largest fringe theatre festival in North America. The Edmonton Folk Music Festival is also held in August. It was the fourth major Canadian folk festival to be created and has the largest budget for talent of Canada festivals. Other summer festivals in and around Edmonton include the Edmonton Heritage Festival, Taste of Edmonton, the Edmonton Pride Festival, Chaos Alberta Festival, Interstellar Rodeo, Big Valley Jamboree, Pigeon Lake Music Festival, Edmonton Rockfest, Edmonton International Reggae Jamboree Festival, Edmonton Blues Festival and Cariwest. Edmonton also hosts a number of winter festivals, one of the oldest being the Silver Skate Festival. Others are Flying Canoe Volant, Ice on Whyte and the Ice Magic Festival.

=== Music ===
In the city&#x27;s early days, music was performed in churches and community halls. Edmonton has a history of opera and classical music performance; both have been supported by a variety of clubs and associations. Edmonton&#x27;s first major radio station, CKUA, began broadcasting music in 1927. The city is a centre for music instruction; the University of Alberta began its music department in 1945, and MacEwan University opened a jazz and musical theatre program in 1980. Festivals of jazz, folk, and classical music are popular entertainment events in the city. Edmonton is also hosts the Grand North American Old Time Fiddle Championship each summer in July, which showcases some of the best fiddlers in Canada, the United States, and Scotland.

The Edmonton Symphony Orchestra has existed under various incarnations since 1913. In 1952 the Edmonton Philharmonic and the Edmonton Pops orchestras amalgamated to form the 60-member modern version. The Orchestra performs at the Francis Winspear Centre for Music.

The city also has a vibrant popular music scene, across genres including hip-hop, reggae, R&amp;B, rock, pop, metal, punk, country and electronic.

=== Nightlife ===
There are several key areas of nightlife in Edmonton. The most popular is the Whyte Avenue (82 Avenue) strip, between 109 Street and 99 Street; it has the highest number of heritage buildings in Edmonton, and bars, clubs, and restaurants throughout, but mostly west of Gateway Boulevard (103 Street). Once the heart of the town of Strathcona (annexed by Edmonton on February 1, 1912), it fell into disrepair during the middle of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, a coordinated effort to revive the area through a business revitalization zone produced an area rich with restored historical buildings and pleasant streetscapes. Its proximity to the University of Alberta has led to a high number of restaurants, pubs, trendy clubs, and retail and specialty shops. This area also has two independent movie theatres, the Garneau and Princess, as well as several live theatre, music, and comedy venues.

Downtown Edmonton has undergone a continual process of renewal and growth since the mid-1990s. Many buildings were demolished during the oil boom, starting in the 1960s and continuing into the 1980s, to make way for office towers. There have always been numerous pub-type establishments, hotel lounges, and restaurants. The past decade has seen a strong resurgence in more mainstream venues. Edmonton also has a high demand for pub crawl tours in the city. Various clubs are found along Edmonton&#x27;s main street, Jasper Avenue. The Edmonton City Centre mall also houses a Landmark Cinemas movie theatre with nine screens. The nonprofit &quot;Metro Cinema&quot; shows a variety of alternative or otherwise unreleased films every week.

West Edmonton Mall holds several after-hour establishments in addition to its many stores and attractions. Bourbon Street has numerous eating establishments; clubs and casinos can also be found within the complex. Scotiabank Theatre (formerly known as Silver City), at the west end of the mall, is a theatre with 12 screens and an IMAX.

==Attractions==
Edmonton is known for its natural scenery, food, history and facilities. It is home to Fort Edmonton Park, Canada&#x27;s largest living history museum, and West Edmonton Mall, North America&#x27;s largest shopping mall. Other notable attractions include the Royal Alberta Museum, the Muttart Conservatory, Alberta Legislature Building, Art Gallery of Alberta, Edmonton Valley Zoo, Alberta Railway Museum, and many other natural and man-made attractions.

=== Parkland and environment ===

Edmonton&#x27;s river valley constitutes the longest stretch of connected urban parkland in North America, and Edmonton has the highest amount of parkland per capita of any Canadian city; the river valley is 22 times larger than New York City&#x27;s Central Park. The river valley is home to various parks ranging from fully serviced urban parks to campsite-like facilities with few amenities. This main &quot;Ribbon of Green&quot; is supplemented by tributary creeks and ravines, particularly the Whitemud Creek, Blackmud Creek, and Mill Creek Ravine. There are also numerous neighbourhood parks located throughout the city, to give a total of of parkland. Within the , -long river valley park system, there are 11 lakes, 14 ravines, and 22 major parks, and most of the city has accessible bike and walking trail connections. These trails are also part of the Waskahegan walking trail. The City of Edmonton has named five parks in its River Valley Parks System in honour of each of &quot;The Famous Five&quot;.

Edmonton&#x27;s streets and parklands also contain one of the largest remaining concentrations of healthy American elm trees in the world, unaffected by Dutch elm disease, which has wiped out vast numbers of such trees in eastern North America. Jack pine, lodgepole pine, white spruce, white birch, aspen, mountain ash, Amur maple, Russian olive, green ash, basswood, various poplars and willows, flowering crabapple, Mayday tree and Manitoba maple are also abundant; bur oak, silver maple, hawthorn and Ohio buckeye are increasingly popular. Other introduced tree species include white ash, blue spruce, Norway maple, red oak, sugar maple, common horse-chestnut, McIntosh apple, and Evans cherry. Three walnut species—butternut, Manchurian walnut, and black walnut—have survived in Edmonton.

Several golf courses, both public and private, are also located in the river valley; the long summer daylight hours of this northern city provide for extended play from early morning well into the evening. Golf courses and the park system become a winter recreation area during this season, and cross-country skiing and skating are popular during the long winter. Four downhill ski slopes are located in the river valley as well, two within the city and two immediately outside.

The Edmonton &amp; Area Land Trust (EALT) is a charity focused on conserving natural areas in Edmonton and surrounding municipalities. Its first project in Edmonton was conserving Larch Sanctuary, via a conservation easement with the city, straddling Whitemud Creek south of 23rd Avenue, and containing the only oxbow lake in the city. EALT works with many organizations in Edmonton, and is working to conserve the of forest and farmland in a loop of the river in northeast Edmonton.

A variety of volunteer opportunities exist for citizens to participate in the stewardship of Edmonton&#x27;s parkland and river valley. Volunteer programs include River Valley Clean-up, Root for Trees, and Partner in Parks. River Valley Clean-up engages volunteers to pick up hundreds of bags of litter each year.

=== Museums and galleries ===
There are many museums in Edmonton of various sizes. The largest is the Royal Alberta Museum (RAM), which was formerly known as the Provincial Museum of Alberta until it was renamed in honour of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s 2005 Alberta centennial visit. The RAM houses over 10 million objects in its collection and showcases the culture and practices of the diverse aboriginal tribes of the region. In 2018, the building relocated from its location in Glenora to a new building in downtown on 103A Avenue and 97 Street. The museum held a grand opening event and gave out 40,000 free tickets for its first few days of operation.

The Telus World of Science is located in the Woodcroft neighbourhood northwest of the city centre. It opened in 1984 and has since been expanded several times. It contains five permanent galleries, one additional gallery for temporary exhibits, an IMAX theatre, a planetarium, an observatory, and an amateur radio station. The Edmonton Valley Zoo is in the river valley to the southwest of the city centre.

The Alberta Aviation Museum, located in a hangar at the City Centre Airport, was built for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Its collection includes both civilian and military aircraft, the largest of which are a Boeing 737 and two CF-101 Voodoos. It also has one of only three BOMARC missiles in Canada.

The Prince of Wales Armouries Heritage Centre is home to the Loyal Edmonton Regiment Military Museum. The museum is dedicated to preserving the military heritage and the sacrifices made by the people of Edmonton and Alberta in general. The museum features two galleries and several smaller exhibits. The collection includes historic firearms, uniforms, souvenirs, memorabilia, military accoutrements, as well as a large photographic and archival collection spanning the pre-World War One period to the present. The museum features an exhibit on the role of the 49th Battalion, CEF in Canada&#x27;s Hundred Days Offensive.

The Telephone Historical Centre is a telephone museum also located in the Prince of Wales Armouries Heritage Centre. In addition to a collection of artifacts tracing the history of the telephone, the museum has its own theatre featuring a brief film led by the robot Xeldon. As of April 2019, the museum is permanently closed.

The Alberta Railway Museum is located in the rural northeast portion of the city. It contains a variety of locomotives and railroad cars from different periods, and includes a working steam locomotive. Since most of its exhibits are outdoors, it is only open between Victoria Day and Labour Day.

Fort Edmonton Park, Canada&#x27;s largest living history museum, is located in the river valley southwest of the city centre. Edmonton&#x27;s heritage is displayed through historical buildings (many of which are originals moved to the park), costumed historical interpreters, and authentic artifacts. In total, it covers the region&#x27;s history from approximately 1795 to 1929 (represented by Fort Edmonton), followed chronologically by 1885, 1905, and 1920 streets, and a recreation of a 1920s midway. A steam train, streetcars, automobiles and horse-drawn vehicles may be seen in operation (and utilized by the public) around the park. The John Walter Museum and Historical Area (c. 1875 to 1901) is on the Canadian Register of Historic Places. The University of Alberta operates its own internal Museums and Collections service.

The Art Gallery of Alberta (AGA) is the city&#x27;s largest single gallery. Formerly housed in an iconic 1970s Brutalist building designed by Don Bittorf, the AGA collection had over 5,000 pieces of art. The former AGA building was demolished in July 2007 to make way for construction of a new facility designed by Randall Stout. It was estimated to cost over $88-million and the amount that Edmonton City Council donated towards its construction was met with some controversy. The AGA officially opened on January 31, 2010. Commercial art galleries can be found throughout the city, especially along the 124 Street/Jasper Avenue corridor, known as the &quot;gallery walk&quot;.

Edmonton is home to four artist-run centres all located in the downtown core Harcourt House, Latitude 53, Ociciwan Contemporary Art Collective and Society of Northern Alberta Print-Artists (SNAP). The University of Alberta and MacEwan University also have galleries: the Fine Arts Building Gallery and the Mitchell Art Gallery, respectively. The University of Alberta Museums and Collections also has 17 million objects, 29 registered museum collections and occasional exhibitions.

== Sports and recreation ==
Edmonton has a number of professional sports teams, including the Edmonton Elks, formerly referred to as the Edmonton Eskimos and, for a brief period, the Edmonton Football Team, of the Canadian Football League, Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League and Edmonton Stingers of the Canadian Elite Basketball League. Edmonton is the only city home to two teams in the semi-professional National Ringette League: the Edmonton WAM! and Edmonton Black Gold Rush.

Edmonton will co-host the 2027 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships alongside Calgary.

== Government ==
=== City council ===
The Edmonton City Council consists of a mayor and twelve councillors serving four-year terms. Each councillor is elected in a ward (electoral district); the mayor is elected at-large through first-past-the-post voting. The elections are non-partisan. Council has the responsibility of approving the city&#x27;s budget, and develops laws and policies intended to promote the health and safety of Edmonton residents based on the powers granted by the Municipal Government Act. The council passes all legislation related to the city&#x27;s police, firefighting, parks, and libraries, as well as its utilities electricity, water supply, solid waste handling, and drainage.

On July 22, 2009, City Council adopted an electoral system that divides Edmonton into 12 wards, instead of the previous system where two councillors were elected in each of six wards. As of 2010, each ward would elect one councillor by first-past-the-post voting. This system came into effect with the following election in October 2010. The most recent election was held in October 2021, and elected members to a four-year term.

On December 7, 2020, a bylaw approving new ward boundaries and Indigenous ward names was passed by city council.

=== Provincial politics ===
Edmonton is the capital of the province of Alberta and holds all main provincial areas of government such as the Alberta Legislature. The Edmonton Metropolitan Region is represented by 20 MLAs, one for each provincial electoral district. Many of these boundaries have been changed, adjusted and renamed while the city has grown. In the current 31st Alberta Legislature all of Edmonton&#x27;s districts are represented by members from the Opposition Alberta New Democratic Party. One of the MLAs, Rachel Notley, is the Leader of the Opposition and was the 17th premier of Alberta from 2015 to 2019.
=== Federal politics ===
Edmonton is represented by nine Members of Parliament (MP), with one being elected to represent each of its federal electoral districts. In the 43rd Canadian Parliament, which was in session from late 2019 to late 2021, eight MPs were members of the Conservative Party of Canada, while the remaining MP was part of the New Democratic Party. After the 2019 federal election, Edmonton lacked elected representation in the federal government for the first time since 1980. Compared to the rest of Alberta, Edmonton tends to vote for more left of centre leaning parties. Due to vote splitting, the Conservative Party dominated the city, with Edmonton Strathcona the only electoral district not to have voted Conservative in the 2019 federal election. This changed in the 2021 federal election, when the NDP also flipped the seat of Edmonton Griesbach while holding Edmonton Strathcona, and the Liberals retook Edmonton Centre.
=== Fire department ===
Edmonton Fire Rescue, established in 1892, is a full-time professional firefighting department which provides a variety of services in Edmonton and the surrounding region. Some of the service&#x27;s major tasks include fire suppression, assistance in medical emergencies, watercraft rescues on the North Saskatchewan River, and emergencies which involve hazardous materials. Edmonton Fire Rescue is one of nine Canadian fire departments which are accredited by the Centre for Public Safety Excellence.

=== Policing ===
The city&#x27;s police force, the Edmonton Police Service, was founded in 1892, and had approximately 1,400 officers in 2012.

=== Military ===
Canadian Forces Base Edmonton is home to 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (1 CMBG), the Regular Force army brigade group of 3rd Canadian Division of the Canadian Army. Units in 1 CMBG include Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians), 1 Combat Engineer Regiment, two of the three battalions of Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, and various headquarters, service, and support elements. Although not part of 1 CMBG, 408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron and 1 Field Ambulance are located with the brigade group. All of these units are located at Lancaster Park, immediately north of the city. From 1943, as CFB Namao (now CFB Edmonton/Edmonton Garrison), it was a major air force base. In 1996, all fixed-wing aviation units were transferred to CFB Cold Lake.

The Canadian Parachute Centre was located in the city until 1996, when it was moved to CFB Trenton, Ontario, and renamed the Canadian Army Advanced Warfare Centre. The move of 1 CMBG and component units from Calgary occurred in 1996 in what was described as a cost-saving measure. The brigade had existed in Calgary since the 1950s, and Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse had traditionally been a Calgary garrison unit dating back to before World War I.

Edmonton also has a large army reserve element from 41 Canadian Brigade Group (41 CBG), including The Loyal Edmonton Regiment (4th Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry); 41 Combat Engineer Regiment; HQ Battery, 20th Field Artillery Regiment; and B Squadron of The South Alberta Light Horse, one of Alberta&#x27;s oldest army reserve units. Despite being far from Canada&#x27;s coasts, Edmonton is also the home of , a naval reserve division. There are numerous cadet corps of the different elements (naval, army and air force) within Edmonton as well.

== Crime ==
Edmonton experienced a decrease in crime in the 1990s, an increase in the early 2000s, and another downturn at the end of the decade.
The Edmonton census metropolitan area (CMA) had a crime severity index of 84.5 in 2013, which is higher than the national average of 68.7. Its crime severity index was the fifth-highest among CMAs in Canada behind Regina, Saskatoon, Kelowna and Vancouver. In 2011, the city set a record for the most homicides in a year with 53 murders, giving the city a homicide rate of 6.5 per 100,000 people. Edmonton had the fourth-most homicides in 2013 with 27, a 49% decrease from 2011. In 2017, it hit another peak in homicides with a slightly lower total of 49, for a rate of 5.2 per 100,000. There were 165 shootings reported in 2022. In 2023, Edmonton saw an increase in homicides with 46 being reported, giving the city a homicide rate of around 4.5 per 100,000 and also had a record 221 shootings, a 33.9% increase from the year before.

Noteworthy events that have occurred in Edmonton include the 1965 Edmonton aircraft bombing, the 2011 murder of Johnny Altinger, the 2012 University of Alberta shooting, the 2014 Edmonton shooting, and the 2017 Edmonton attack. Over $100,000 of property damage to Edmonton City Hall occurred in a shooting and firebombs attack on January 23, 2024, where no one was injured.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transportation ===

==== Aviation ====
Edmonton is a major air transportation gateway to northern Alberta and northern Canada. The Edmonton International Airport (YEG) is the main airport serving the city.

The airport provides passenger service to destinations in the United States, Europe, Mexico, and the Caribbean. The airport is located within Leduc County, adjacent to the City of Leduc and the Nisku Industrial Business Park. With direct air distances from Edmonton to places such as London in United Kingdom being shorter than to other main airports in western North America, Edmonton Airports is working to establish a major container shipping hub called Port Alberta.

==== Rail ====
Edmonton serves as a major transportation hub for Canadian National Railway, whose North American operations management centre is located at their Edmonton offices. It is also tied into the Canadian Pacific Kansas City network, which provides service from Calgary to the south and extends northeast of Edmonton to serve Alberta&#x27;s Industrial Heartland.

Inter-city rail passenger rail service is provided by Via Rail&#x27;s premier train, the &quot;Canadian&quot;, as it travels between Vancouver, British Columbia, and Toronto, Ontario. Passenger trains stop at the Edmonton railway station two days a week in both directions. The train connects Edmonton to multiple stops in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario.

==== Public transit ====

The Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) is the city&#x27;s public transit agency, operating the Edmonton Light Rail Transit (LRT) network as well as a fleet of buses. In 2017, ETS served approximately 86,997,466 people; the bus system saw 62,377,183 riders, while the LRT network served 24,620,283 passengers.

From the 1990s to early 2009, Edmonton was one of two cities in Canada still operating trolley buses, along with Vancouver. On June 18, 2008, City Council decided to abandon the Edmonton trolley bus system and the last trolley bus ran on May 2, 2009.

Scheduled LRT service began on April 23, 1978, with nine extensions of the network completed since. The original Edmonton line is considered to be the first &quot;modern&quot; light rail line (i.e., built from scratch, rather than being an upgrade of an old system) in North America to be constructed in a city with a population of under one million people. It introduced the use of German-designed rolling stock that subsequently became the standard light rail vehicle of the United States. The Edmonton &quot;proof-of-payment&quot; fare collection system adopted in 1980 modelled after European ticket systems became the North American transit industry&#x27;s preferred approach for subsequent light rail projects. The four-year South LRT extension was opened in full on April 24, 2010, which sees trains travelling to Century Park (located at 23 Avenue and 111 Street), making stops at South Campus and Southgate Centre along the way. A line to the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology in north-central Edmonton using the same high-floor technology of the existing system opened September 6, 2015. The southeast leg of the Valley Line, which starts in Mill Woods and ends in the downtown core, opened on November 4, 2023, after experiencing significant delays. Construction on the second and final phase of the Valley Line, which will extend the line west to Lewis Farms, commenced in 2021. Unlike the Capital and Metro lines, trains on the Valley Line use low-floor technology.

Edmonton is a member of the Edmonton Metropolitan Transit Services Commission, which will begin service in mid-2022. The Edmonton Metropolitan Transit Services Commission is scheduled to be disestablished May 31, 2023, as a result of Edmonton&#x27;s withdrawal.

==== Roads and highways ====

A largely gridded system forms most of Edmonton&#x27;s street and road network. The address system is mostly numbered, with streets running south to north and avenues running east to west. In built-up areas built since the 1950s, local streets and major roadways generally do not conform to the grid system. Major roadways include Kingsway, Yellowhead Trail (Highway 16), Whitemud Drive and Anthony Henday Drive.

The major roads connecting to other communities elsewhere in Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan are the Yellowhead Highway to the west and east and Highway 2 (Queen Elizabeth II Highway) to the south.

==== Trail system ====
Edmonton maintains over of multi-use trails, mostly within the river valley parkland system.

=== Electricity and water ===
Edmonton&#x27;s first power company established itself in 1891 and installed streetlights along the city&#x27;s main avenue, Jasper Avenue. The power company was bought by the Town of Edmonton in 1902 and remains under municipal ownership today as EPCOR. Also in charge of water treatment, in 2002 EPCOR installed the world&#x27;s largest ultraviolet (UV) water treatment (ultraviolet disinfection) system at its E. L. Smith Water Treatment Plant.

=== Waste disposal ===
Edmonton delivers source-separated organics waste collection to all single-unit, and some multi-unit homes. The city collects four streams of waste under this program: Garbage in black bins, organic waste in green bins, recycling in blue bags, and yard waste in large brown paper bags or clear plastic bags (four times per year). The rollout of the source-separated organics program began in March 2021, and was completed on September 3, 2021. During this period, Edmonton delivered approximately 10,000 new carts every week to a total of approximately 250,000 homes. City employees collect waste from half of these homes, and collection from the other homes is contracted to a private company.

An anaerobic digester began service in April 2021, and has the capacity to process 40,000 tonnes of organic waste annually. This facility produces high-quality compost and generates renewable heat and electricity. Edmonton signed contracts for private partners to process the remaining 28,000 tonnes of organic waste generated annually. In spring 2021, the city started selling compost produced at this facility.

The city will roll-out the new waste collection service to the remaining multi-unit households which receive curbside service, but were not included in the initial transition, in 2023. Meanwhile, the city has stopped offering curbside waste collection from commercial businesses, and has not yet said whether businesses will eventually be required to separate their organic waste. The rollout of the new waste collection system follows a successful two-year pilot program which began service in 2019, and included 8,000 households in 12 neighbourhoods.

The Edmonton Composting Facility was the largest of its type in the world, and the largest stainless steel building in North America. Among the innovative uses for the city&#x27;s waste included a Christmas tree recycling program. The trees were collected each January and put through a woodchipper; this material was used as an addition to the composting process. In addition, the wood chips absorbed much of the odour produced by the compost by providing a biofilter element to trap odour causing gaseous results of the process. The composting facility was permanently shut down in 2019 after an inspection found that the structural integrity of its roof was compromised.

Together, the Waste Management Centre and Wastewater Treatment plant are known as the Edmonton Waste Management Centre of Excellence. Research partners include the University of Alberta, the Alberta Research Council, the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology, and Olds College.

=== Health care ===
There are four main hospitals serving Edmonton: University of Alberta Hospital, Royal Alexandra Hospital, Misericordia Community Hospital, and Grey Nuns Community Hospital. Other area hospitals include Sturgeon Community Hospital in St. Albert, Leduc Community Hospital in Leduc, WestView Health Centre in Stony Plain, and Fort Saskatchewan Community Hospital in Fort Saskatchewan. Dedicated psychiatric care is provided at the Alberta Hospital. The Northeast Community Health Centre offers a 24-hour emergency room with no inpatient ward services. The University of Alberta Hospital is the centre of a larger complex of hospitals and clinics located adjacent to the university campus which comprises the Stollery Children&#x27;s Hospital, Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, Cross Cancer Institute, Zeidler Gastrointestinal Health Centre, Ledcor Clinical Training Centre, and Edmonton Clinic. Several health research institutes, including the Heritage Medical Research Centre, Medical Sciences Building, Katz Group Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research, and Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation, are also located at this site. A similar set-up is also evident at the Royal Alexandra Hospital, which is connected to the Lois Hole Hospital for Women and Orthopaedic Surgery Centre. All hospitals are under the administration of Alberta Health Services, the single provincial health authority that plans and delivers health services to Albertans, on behalf of the Ministry of Health. The Misericordia and Grey Nuns are run separately by Covenant Health.

== Education ==
=== Primary and secondary ===
Edmonton has three publicly funded school boards (districts) that provide kindergarten and grades 1–12. The vast majority of students attend schools in the two large English-language boards: Edmonton Public Schools, with 213 operating schools, and the separate Edmonton Catholic School District, with 95 operating schools, as of 2024. Since 1994, the Francophone minority community has had their own school board based in Edmonton, the Greater North Central Francophone Education Region No. 2, which includes surrounding communities. The city also has a number of public charter schools that are independent of any board. All three school boards and public charter schools are funded through provincial grants and property taxes.

Some private schools exist as well, including Edmonton Academy, Progressive Academy and Tempo School.

Edmonton Public Schools is known for pioneering the concept of site-based decision making (decentralization) in Canada, which gives principals the authority, the financial resources and the flexibility to make decisions based on the individual needs of their schools. This initiative has led to Edmonton Public offering a school of choice model in which students have more options as to what school they want to attend to suit their interests, and has led to the creation of alternative programs such as Vimy Ridge Academy, Old Scona Academic and Victoria School of the Arts. The Edmonton Society for Christian Education and Millwoods Christian School (not part of the former) used to be private schools; both have become part of Edmonton Public Schools&#x27; alternative programs.

Both the Edmonton Public Schools and the Edmonton Catholic School District provide support and resources for those wishing to homeschool their children.

=== Post-secondary ===
Those post-secondary institutions based in Edmonton that are publicly funded include Concordia University of Edmonton, MacEwan University, NorQuest College, the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT) and the University of Alberta (U of A). The publicly funded Athabasca University also has a campus in Edmonton.

The U of A is a board-governed institution that has an annual revenue of over one billion dollars. In 2021/22, the university had over 40,000 students enrolled within over 700 undergraduate, graduate and professional programs, as well as over 7,000 students enrolled in its faculty of extension. The U of A is also home to the second-largest research library system in Canada.

In 2019/20, MacEwan University had a total student population of over 18,000 full-time and part-time students enrolled in programs offering bachelor&#x27;s degrees, university transfers, diplomas and certificates. NAIT has an approximate total of 41,000 students enrolled in more than 200 programs, while NorQuest College has approximately 21,000 students enrolled in various full-time, part-time and continuing education programs.

Other post-secondary institutions within Edmonton include King&#x27;s University (private), Newman Theological College, Taylor College and Seminary, and Yellowhead Tribal College (an Indigenous college).

== Media ==
Edmonton has seven local broadcast television stations shown on basic cable TV or over-the-air, with the oldest broadcasters in the city being CTV Edmonton (1954) and CBC TV Edmonton (1961). Most of Edmonton&#x27;s conventional television stations have made the switch to over-the-air digital broadcasting. The cable television providers in Edmonton are Telus (for IPTV) and Shaw Communications. Twenty-one FM and eight AM radio stations are based in Edmonton.

Edmonton has two large-circulation daily newspapers, the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; and the &quot;Edmonton Sun&quot;. The &quot;Journal&quot;, established in 1903, has a daily circulation of 112,000. The &quot;Sun&quot;, established in 1978, has a circulation of 55,000. Both newspapers are owned by the Postmedia Network. The &quot;Journal&quot; no longer publishes a Sunday edition as of July 2012.

&quot;Metro&quot;, Edmonton&#x27;s only free daily newspaper, ceased printing on December 20, 2019. The magazine &quot;Vue Weekly,&quot; a weekly publication which focused on alternative news, was published in Edmonton from 1995 to 2018. The &quot;Edmonton Examiner&quot; is a citywide community-based paper also published weekly. There are also a number of smaller weekly and community newspapers.

== Sister cities ==

Edmonton has five sister cities.

* Gatineau, Quebec, Canada (1967)
* Harbin, China (1985)
* Nashville, Tennessee, United States (1990)
* Wonju, South Korea (1998)
* Bergen op Zoom, the Netherlands (2013)

In the United States, American cities and their sisters are listed with that country&#x27;s Sister Cities International. In 1990, Edmonton became the first sister city of Nashville. In 2015, Nashville Mayor Karl Dean visited Edmonton, addressing the crowd at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival, celebrating the 25th anniversary of becoming sister cities. That year, more than 150 Canadians visited Nashville to attend Alberta-born Brett Kissel&#x27;s Grand Ole Opry debut and to meet with Sister Cities representatives. In November 2015, Doug Hoyer and Jeremy Witten represented Edmonton at World of Friendship, Nashville&#x27;s annual sister cities celebration.

<text>Baroness Emma Orczy (full name: &quot;Emma Magdalena Rozália Mária Jozefa Borbála Orczy de Orci&quot;) (; 23 September 1865 – 12 November 1947), usually known as Baroness Orczy (the name under which she was published) or to her family and friends as Emmuska Orczy, was a Hungarian-born British novelist and playwright. She is best known for her series of novels featuring the Scarlet Pimpernel, the alter ego of Sir Percy Blakeney, a wealthy English fop who turns into a quick-thinking escape artist in order to save French aristocrats from &quot;Madame Guillotine&quot; during the French Revolution, establishing the &quot;hero with a secret identity&quot; in popular culture.

Opening in London&#x27;s West End on 5 January 1905, &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; became a favourite of British audiences. Some of Orczy&#x27;s paintings were exhibited at the Royal Academy in London. She established the Women of England&#x27;s Active Service League during World War I with the intention of empowering women to convince men to enlist in the military.

==Early life==
Orczy was born in Tarnaörs, Hungary. She was the daughter of the composer Baron Félix Orczy de Orci (1835–1892) and Countess Emma Wass de Szentegyed et Cege (1839–1892).
Her paternal grandfather, Baron László Orczy (1787–1880) was a royal councillor, and knight of the Sicilian order of Saint George, her paternal grandmother, Baroness Magdolna, born Magdolna Müller (1811–1879), was of Austrian origin. Her maternal grandparents were the Count Sámuel Wass de Szentegyed et Cege (1815–1879), member of the Hungarian parliament, and Rozália Eperjessy de Károlyfejérvár (1814–1884).

Emma&#x27;s parents left their estate for Budapest in 1868, fearful of the threat of a peasant revolution. They lived in Budapest, Brussels, and Paris, where Emma studied music unsuccessfully. Finally, in 1880, the 14-year-old Emma and her family moved to London, England where they lodged with their countryman, Francis Pichler, at 162 Great Portland Street. Orczy attended West London School of Art and then the Heatherley School of Fine Art.

Although not destined to be a painter, it was at art school that she met a young illustrator named Henry George Montagu MacLean Barstow, the son of an English clergyman; they were married at St Marylebone parish church on 7 November 1894. It was the start of what she described as a joyful and happy marriage, &quot;for close on half a century, one of perfect happiness and understanding, of perfect friendship and communion of thought.&quot;

==Writing career==
They had very little money and Orczy started to work with her husband as a translator and an illustrator to supplement his meager earnings. John Montague Orczy-Barstow, their only child, was born on 25 February 1899 (died 1969). She started writing soon after his birth, but her first novel, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Candlesticks&quot; (1899), was a failure. She did, however, find a small following with a series of detective stories in the &quot;Royal Magazine&quot;. Her next novel, &quot;In Mary&#x27;s Reign&quot; (1901), did better.

In 1903, she and her husband wrote &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, a play based on one of her short stories about an English aristocrat, Sir Percy Blakeney, Bart., who rescued French aristocrats from the French Revolution. She had conceived the character while standing on a platform on the London Underground. She submitted her novelisation of the story under the same title to 12 publishers. While the couple waited for the decisions of these publishers, Fred Terry and Julia Neilson accepted the play for production in London&#x27;s West End. Initially, it drew small audiences, but the play ran for four years in London, and broke many stage records, eventually playing more than 2,000 performances and becoming one of the most popular shows staged in Britain. It was translated and produced in other countries and underwent several revivals. This theatrical success generated huge sales for the novel. The couple moved to Thanet, Kent.

Introducing the notion of a &quot;hero with a secret identity&quot; into popular culture, the Scarlet Pimpernel exhibits characteristics that would become standard superhero conventions, including the penchant for disguise, use of a signature weapon (sword), ability to out-think and outwit his adversaries, and a calling card (he leaves behind a scarlet pimpernel at each of his interventions). By drawing attention to his alter ego, Blakeney hides behind his public face as a slow-thinking, foppish playboy, and he also establishes a network of supporters, The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, who aid his endeavours.

Orczy went on to write over a dozen sequels featuring Sir Percy Blakeney, his family, and the other members of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, of which the first, &quot;I Will Repay&quot; (1906), was the most popular. The last Pimpernel book, &quot;Mam&#x27;zelle Guillotine&quot;, was published in 1940. None of her three subsequent plays matched the success of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;. She also wrote popular mystery fiction and many adventure romances. Her &quot;Lady Molly of Scotland Yard&quot; was an early example of a female detective as the main character. Other popular detective stories featured &quot;The Old Man in the Corner&quot;, a sleuth who chiefly used logic to solve crimes. Orczy was a founding member of the Detection Club (1930).

Orczy&#x27;s novels were racy, mannered melodramas and she favoured historical fiction. Critic Mary Cadogan states, &quot;Orczy&#x27;s books are highly wrought and intensely atmospheric&quot;. In &quot;The Nest of the Sparrowhawk&quot; (1909), for example, a malicious guardian in Puritan Kent tricks his beautiful, wealthy young ward into marrying him by disguising himself as an exiled French prince. He persuades his widowed sister-in-law to abet him in this plot, in which she unwittingly disgraces one of her long-lost sons and finds the other murdered by the villain. Even though this novel had no link to &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; other than its shared authorship, the publisher advertised it as part of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel Series&quot;.

==Political views==
Orczy held strong political views. She was a firm believer in the superiority of the aristocracy, as well as being a supporter of British imperialism and militarism. During World War I, Orczy formed the Women of England&#x27;s Active Service League, an unofficial organisation aimed at encouraging women to persuade men to volunteer for active service in the armed forces. Her aim was to enlist 100,000 women who would pledge &quot;to persuade every man I know to offer his service to his country&quot;. Some 20,000 women joined her organisation. Orczy strongly opposed the Soviet Union.

==Later life==
Orczy&#x27;s work was so successful that she was able to buy a house in Monte Carlo: &quot;Villa Bijou&quot; at 19 Avenue de la Costa (since demolished), which is where she spent World War II. She was not able to return to London until after the war. Montagu Barstow died in Monte Carlo in 1942. Finding herself alone and unable to travel, she wrote her memoir &quot;Links in the Chain of Life&quot; (published 1947).

She died in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire on 12 November 1947.

==Name pronunciation==
Asked how to say her name, Orczy told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot;: &quot;Or-tsey. &quot;Emmuska&quot;—a diminutive meaning &quot;little Emma&quot;—accent on the first syllable, the &quot;s&quot; equivalent to &quot;sh&quot; in English; thus, .&quot;
