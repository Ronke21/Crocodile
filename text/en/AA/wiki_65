<text>Bal Keshav Thackeray (; 23 January 1926 – 17 November 2012), also known as Balasaheb Thackeray, was an Indian cartoonist and politician who founded the original Shiv Sena, a right-wing pro-Marathi and Hindu nationalist party active mainly in the state of Maharashtra.

Thackeray began his professional career as a cartoonist with the English-language daily, &quot;The Free Press Journal&quot; in Bombay, but he left the paper in 1960 to form his own political weekly, &quot;Marmik&quot;. His political philosophy was largely shaped by his father Keshav Sitaram Thackeray, a leading figure in the Samyukta Maharashtra (United Maharashtra) movement, which advocated the creation of a separate linguistic state for Marathi speakers. Through &quot;Marmik&quot;, Bal Thackeray campaigned against the growing influence of non-Marathis in Mumbai.

He had a large political influence in the state, especially in Mumbai. 

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Thackeray built the Shiv Sena with help of Madhav Mehere, Chief Attorney for Trade Union of India, Babasaheb Purandare, historian for Govt of Maharashtra and Madhav Deshpande, Head Accountant for Shiv Sena. These three individuals to a large extent were responsible for the success of Shiv Sena and stability of politics in Mumbai till 2000 to ensure it grows into an economic power center. Thackeray was also the founder of the Marathi-language newspaper &quot;Saamana&quot;. After the riots of 1992–93, he and his party took a Hindutva stance. In 1999, Thackeray was banned from voting and contesting in any election for six years on the recommendations of the Election Commission for indulging in seeking votes in the name of religion. Thackeray was arrested multiple times and spent a brief stint in prison, but he never faced any major legal repercussions. Upon his death, he was accorded a state funeral, at which many mourners were present. Thackeray did not held any official positions, and he was never formally elected as the leader of his party.

== Early life ==

Thackeray was born on 23 January 1926 in Pune, the son of Prabodhankar Thackeray and his wife Ramabai Thackeray. The family belongs to the Marathi Hindu Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu community. His father Keshav was an admirer of India-born British writer William Makepeace Thackeray, and changed his own surname from Panvelkar to &quot;Thackeray&quot; an Anglicised version of their ancestral surname &quot;Thakre&quot;.

Bal&#x27;s father was a journalist and cartoonist by profession; he was also a social activist and a writer who was involved in a Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti, which advocated the creation of a separate linguistic state for Marathi speakers. He also started a magazine named Prabodhan, where he promoted Hindu philosophies and nationalistic ideals to revive Hindutva in society. This proved to be highly influential in shaping Bal Thackeray&#x27;s political views.

Bal was the eldest of eight siblings, with brothers Shrikant Thackeray (father of Raj Thackeray) and Ramesh Thackeray, and five sisters (Sanjeevani Karandikar, Prabhavati (Pama) Tipnis, Malati (Sudha) Sule, Sarla Gadkari and Susheela Gupte).

Raj broke away from Shiv Sena to form his own political party called the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena. Despite Raj&#x27;s breakaway from the main party, he continues to maintain that Thackeray was his ideologue and relations between them improved during Thackeray&#x27;s final years.

==Cartoonist career==
Thackeray began his career as a cartoonist in the Free Press Journal in Mumbai. His cartoons were also published in the Sunday edition of The Times of India. After Thackeray&#x27;s differences with the Free Press Journal, he and four or five people, including politician George Fernandes, left the paper and started their own daily, News Day. The paper survived for one or two months. In 1960, he launched the cartoon weekly &quot;Marmik&quot; with his brother Srikant. It focused on issues of common &quot;Marathi Manoos&quot; (Marathi, or Marathi-speaking, people) including unemployment, immigration and the retrenchment of Marathi workers. Its office in Ranade Road became the rallying point for Marathi youth. Bal Thackeray later stated that it was &quot;not just a cartoon weekly but also the prime reason for the birth and growth of the Sena&quot;. It was the issue of &quot;Marmik&quot; on 5 June 1966 which first announced the launch of membership for the Shiv Sena.

Thackeray drew cartoons for the &quot;Free Press Journal&quot;, the &quot;Times of India&quot; and &quot;Marmik&quot; besides contributing to &quot;Saamna&quot; till 2012. He cited the New Zealander cartoonist David Low as his inspiration.

==Politics==
=== 1966–1998 ===
The success of &quot;Marmik&quot; prompted Thackeray to form the Shiv Sena on 19 June 1966. The name &quot;Shiv Sena&quot; (Shivaji&#x27;s Army) is a reference to the 17th century Maratha Emperor Shivaji. Initially, Thackeray said it was not a political party but an army of Shivaji Maharaj, inclined to fight for the Marathi &quot;maanus&quot; (person). It demanded that native speakers of the state&#x27;s local language Marathi (the &quot;sons of the soil&quot; movement) be given preferential treatment in private and public sector jobs. The early objective of the Shiv Sena was to ensure their job security competing against South Indians and Gujaratis. In its 1966 party manifesto, Thackeray primarily blamed south Indians. In &quot;Marmik&quot;, Thackeray published a list of corporate officials from a local directory, many being south Indians, citing it as proof that Maharashtrians were being discriminated against.

His party grew in the next ten years. Senior leaders such as Babasaheb Purandare, chief attorney for Trade Union of Maharashtra Madhav Mehere joined the party and chartered accountant Madhav Gajanan Deshpande backed various aspects of the party operations. In 1969, Thackeray and Manohar Joshi were jailed after participating in a protest demanding the merger of Karwar, Belgaum and Nipani regions in Maharashtra. During the 1970s, it did not succeed in the local elections and it was active mainly in Mumbai, compared to the rest of the state. The party set up local branch offices and settled disputes, complaints against the government. It later started violent tactics with attacks against rival parties, migrants and the media; the party agitated by destroying public and private property. Thackeray publicly supported Indira Gandhi during the 1975 Emergency; Thackeray supported the Congress party numerous times.

Dr. Hemchandra Gupte, Mayor of Mumbai and the former family physician and confidant of Thackeray, left Shiv Sena in 1976 citing the emphasis given to money, violence committed by the Shiv Sena members, and Thackeray&#x27;s support for Indira Gandhi and the 1975 emergency.

Politically, the Shiv Sena was anti-communist, and wrested control of trade unions in Mumbai from the Communist Party of India (CPI). Local unemployed youth from the declining textile industry joined the party and it further expanded because of Maharashtrians from the Konkan region. By the 1980s, it became a threat to the ruling Congress party which had initially encouraged it because of it rivalling the CPI. In 1989, the Sena&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Saamna&quot; was launched by Thackeray. Because of Thackeray being against the Mandal Commission report, his close aide Chhagan Bhujbal left the party in 1991. Following the 1992 Bombay riots, Thackeray took stances viewed as anti-Muslim and based on Hindutva. Shiv Sena later allied itself with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP-Shiv Sena alliance won the 1995 Maharashtra State Assembly elections and were in power from 1995 to 1999. Thackeray declared himself to be the &quot;remote control&quot; chief minister.

Thackeray and the Chief Minister Manohar Joshi were explicitly named for inciting the Shivsainiks for violence against Muslims during the 1992–1993 riots in an inquiry ordered by the government of India, the Srikrishna Commission Report.

Thackeray had influence in the film industry. His party workers agitated against films he found controversial and would disrupt film screenings, causing losses. &quot;Bombay&quot;, a 1995 film on the riots, was opposed by them.

=== 1999–2012 ===
On 28 July 1999, Thackeray was banned from voting and contesting in any election for six years from 11 December 1999 till 10 December 2005 on the recommendations of the Election Commission for indulging in corrupt practice by seeking votes in the name of religion. In 2000, he was arrested for his role in the riots but was released because the statute of limitations expired. In 2002, Thackeray issued a call to form Hindu suicide bomber squads to take on the menace of terrorism. In response, the Maharashtra government registered a case against him for inciting enmity between different groups. At least two organisations founded and managed by retired Indian Army officers, Lt Col Jayant Rao Chitale and Lt Gen. P.N. Hoon (former commander-in-chief of the Western Command), responded to the call with such statements as not allowing Pakistanis to work in India due to accusations against Pakistan for supporting attacks in India by militants. After the six-year voting ban on Thackeray was lifted in 2005, he voted for the first time in the 2007 BMC elections. Eight or nine cases against Thackeray and &quot;Saamna&quot; for inflammatory writings were not investigated by the government.

Thackeray said that the Shiv Sena had helped the Marathi people in Mumbai, especially in the public sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;Public sector, Threats against other communities, businesses owned especially by Guj and Marwaris/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Thackeray believed that Hindus must be organised to struggle against those who oppose their identity and religion. Opposition leftist parties alleged that the Shiv Sena has done little to solve the problem of unemployment facing a large proportion of Maharashtrian youth during its tenure, in contradiction to its ideological foundation of &#x27;sons of the soil.&#x27;

In 2006, Thackeray&#x27;s nephew Raj Thackeray broke away from Shiv Sena to form the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) during Thackeray&#x27;s retirement and appointment of his son, Uddhav rather than Raj as the leader of Shiv Sena. Narayan Rane also quit around that time.

The Sena acted as a &quot;moral police&quot; and opposed Valentine&#x27;s Day celebrations. On 14 February 2006, Thackeray condemned and apologised for the violent attacks by its Shiv Sainiks on a private celebration in Mumbai. &quot;It is said that women were beaten up in the Nallasopara incident. If that really happened, then it is a symbol of cowardice. I have always instructed Shiv Sainiks that in any situation women should not be humiliated and harassed.&quot; Thackeray and the Shiv Sena remained opposed to it, although they indicated support for an Indian alternative.

In 2007, he was briefly arrested and let out on bail after referring to Muslims as &#x27;Green Poison&#x27; during a Shiv Sena rally.

On 27 March 2008, in protest to Thackeray&#x27;s editorial, leaders of Shiv Sena in Delhi resigned, citing its outrageous conduct towards non-Marathis in Maharashtra and announced that they would form a separate party. Addressing a press conference, Shiv Sena&#x27;s North India chief Jai Bhagwan Goyal said the decision to leave the party was taken because of the partial attitude of the party high command towards Maharashtrians. Goyal further said that Shiv Sena is no different from Khalistan and Jammu and Kashmir militant groups which are trying to create a rift between people along regional lines. The main aim of these forces is to split our country. Like the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, the Shiv Sena too has demeaned North Indians and treated them inhumanely.

== Views ==
Thackeray declared that he was not against every Muslim, but only those who reside in this country but do not obey the laws of the land, considering such people to be traitors. The Shiv Sena is viewed by the media as being Islamophobic, though Shiv Sena members officially reject this accusation. When explaining his views on Hindutva, he equated Islam with violence and called on Hindus to fight terrorism and fight Islam. In an interview with Suketu Mehta, he called for the mass expulsion of illegal Bangladeshi Muslim migrants from India and for a visa system to enter Mumbai, the Indian National Congress state government had earlier during the Indira Gandhi declared national emergency considered a similar measure.

He told &quot;India Today&quot; &quot;[Muslims] are spreading like a cancer and should be operated on like a cancer. The country...should be saved from the Muslims and the police should support them [Hindu Maha Sangh] in their struggle just like the police in Punjab were sympathetic to the Khalistanis.&quot; However, in an interview in 1998, he said that his stance had changed on many issues that the Shiv Sena had with Muslims, particularly regarding the Babri Mosque or Ram Janmabhoomi issue: &quot;We must look after the Muslims and treat them as part of us.&quot; He also expressed admiration for Muslims in Mumbai in the wake of the 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings perpetrated by Islamic fundamentalists. In response to threats made by Abu Azmi, a leader of the Samajwadi Party, that accusations of terrorism directed at Indian Muslims would bring about communal strife, Thackeray said that the unity of Mumbaikars (residents of Mumbai) in the wake of the attacks was a slap to fanatics of Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi and that Thackeray salute[s] those Muslims who participated in the two minutes&#x27; silence on 18 July to mourn the blast victims. Again in 2008 he wrote: &quot;Islamic terrorism is growing and Hindu terrorism is the only way to counter it. We need suicide bomb squads to protect India and Hindus.&quot; He also reiterated a desire for Hindus to unite across linguistic barriers to see a Hindustan for Hindus and to bring Islam in this country down to its knees.

Thackeray was criticised for his praise of Adolf Hitler. He was quoted by &quot;Asiaweek&quot; as saying: &quot;I am a great admirer of Hitler, and I am not ashamed to say so! I do not say that I agree with all the methods he employed, but he was a wonderful organiser and orator, and I feel that he and I have several things in common...What India really needs is a dictator who will rule benevolently, but with an iron hand.&quot; In a 1993 interview, Thackeray stated, &quot;There is nothing wrong if Muslims are treated as Jews were in Nazi Germany.&quot; In another 1992 interview, Thackeray stated, &quot;If you take &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and if you remove the word &#x27;Jew&#x27; and put in the word &#x27;Muslim&#x27;, that is what I believe in&quot;. &quot;Indian Express&quot; published an interview on 29 January 2007: &quot;Hitler did very cruel and ugly things. But he was an artist, I love him [for that]. He had the power to carry the whole nation, the mob with him. You have to think what magic he had. He was a miracle...The killing of Jews was wrong. But the good part about Hitler was that he was an artist. He was a daredevil. He had good qualities and bad. I may also have good qualities and bad ones.&quot; Thackeray also praised Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi.

In 2008, following agitation against Biharis and other north Indians travelling to Maharashtra to take civil service examinations for the Indian Railways due to an overlimit of the quota in their home provinces, Thackeray also said of Bihari MPs that they were spitting in the same plate from which they ate when they criticised Mumbaikars and Maharashtrians. He wrote: &quot;They are trying to add fuel to the fire that has been extinguished, by saying that Mumbaikars have rotten brains.&quot; He also criticised Chhath Puja, a holiday celebrated by Biharis and those from eastern Uttar Pradesh, which occurs on six days of the Hindu month of Kartik. He said that it was not a real holiday. This was reportedly a response to MPs from Bihar who had disrupted the proceedings of the Lok Sabha in protest to the attacks on North Indians. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, upset with the remarks, called on the prime minister and the central government to intervene in the matter. A &quot;Saamna&quot; editorial prompted at least 16 MPs from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, belonging to the Rashtriya Janata Dal, Janata Dal (United), Samajwadi Party and the Indian National Congress, to give notice for breach of privilege proceedings against Thackeray. After the matter was raised in the Lok Sabha, Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said: &quot;If anybody has made any comment on our members&#x27; functioning in the conduct of business in the House, not only do we treat that with the contempt that it deserves, but also any action that may be necessary will be taken according to procedure and well established norms. Nobody will be spared.&#x27;&quot;

In 2009, he criticised Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, a &quot;Marathi icon&quot;, for saying he was an Indian before he was a Maharashtrian.

===Opposition to Caste Based Reservations===
Thackeray firmly opposed caste based reservation and said, &quot;There are only two castes in the world, the rich are rich and the poor is poor, make the poor rich but don&#x27;t make the rich poor. Besides these two castes I don&#x27;t believe in any other casteism.&quot;

The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) supported caste-based reservations based on the Mandal commission. Thackarey, despite being warned that opposition to the reservations would be politically suicidal for the Shiv Sena party, opposed the BJP over this issue and said he would initiate proceedings against the BJP if the BJP supported caste-based reservations. This also led to his conflict with Chhagan Bhujbal, an OBC, who later left the Shiv Sena.

===Views on Savarkar===
Thackeray defended Savarkar against criticism and praised him as a great leader. In 2002, when President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam unveiled a portrait of Savarkar in the presence of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the Congress Party opposed the unveiling of the portrait and boycotted the function. Thackeray criticised the opposition and said, &quot;Who is [Congress president and Leader of the Opposition] Sonia Gandhi to object to the portrait? What relation does she have with the country? How much does she know about the history and culture of India?&quot;. Years later, when Congress General Secretary Digvijaya Singh made a statement that Savarkar was allegedly the first one to suggest the two-nation theory that led to the partition, Thackeray rejected the statement of Singh.

=== Support for Kashmiri Pandits ===
In 1990, Bal Thackeray got seats reserved in engineering colleges for the children of Kashmiri Pandits in Maharashtra. At a meeting with them he supported the idea that Kashmiri Pandits could be armed for their self-defence against Jihadis.

== Personal life ==
Thackeray was married to Meena Thackeray (née Sarla Vaidya) on 13 June 1948 and had three sons, oldest son Bindumadhav, middle son Jaidev, and youngest son Uddhav. Meena died in 1995 and Bindumadhav died the following year in a car accident.

== Death ==

Thackeray died on 17 November 2012, of cardiac arrest. Mumbai came to a virtual halt immediately as news about his death broke out, with shops and commercial establishments shutting down. The entire state of Maharashtra was put on high alert. The police appealed for calm and 20,000 Mumbai police officers, 15 units of the State Reserve Police Force and three contingents of the Rapid Action Force were deployed. It was reported that Shiv Sena workers forced shops to close down in some areas. Then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called for calm in the city and praised Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;strong leadership&quot;, while there were also statements of praise and condolences from other senior politicians such as the then-Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP leader and MP (Former Deputy Prime Minister of India), L. K. Advani.

He was accorded a state funeral at Shivaji Park, which generated some controversy and resulted from demands made by Shiv Sena. It was the first public funeral in the city since that of Bal Gangadhar Tilak in 1920. Thackeray&#x27;s body was moved to the park on 18 November. Many mourners attended his funeral, although there were no official figures. The range reported in media sources varied from around 1 million, to 1.5 million and as many as nearly 2 million. His cremation took place the next day, where his son Uddhav lit the pyre. Among those present at his cremation were senior representatives of the Maharashtra government and the event was broadcast live on national television channels. The Parliament of India opened for its winter session on 21 November 2012. Thackeray was the only non-member to be noted in its traditional list of obituaries. He is one of few people to have been recorded thus without being a member of either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha. Despite having not held any official position, he was given the 21-gun salute, which was again a rare honour. Both houses of Bihar Assembly also paid tribute. The funeral expenses created further controversies when media reports claimed that the BMC had used taxpayers&#x27; money. In response to these reports, the party later sent a cheque of Rs. 500,000 to the corporation.

&quot;The Hindu,&quot; in an editorial, said regarding the shutdown that &quot;Thackeray’s legion of followers raised him to the status of a demigod who could force an entire State to shut down with the mere threat of violence&quot;. Following his death, police arrested a 21-year-old woman who posted a Facebook comment against him, as well as her friend who &quot;liked&quot; the comment. Shiv Sena members also vandalised the clinic owned by the woman&#x27;s relative.

== Legacy ==
Thackeray was called &quot;Hindū Hṛdaya Samrāṭa&quot; () by his supporters. His yearly address at Shivaji Park was popular among his followers. In 2012, he instead gave a video-taped speech and urged his followers &quot;to give the same love and affection to his son and political heir Uddhav as they had given him&quot;. Thackeray was known to convert popular sentiment into votes, getting into controversies and making no apologies for it though his son has tried to tone down the party&#x27;s stance after his death. He was known for his inflammatory writings, was seen as a good orator who used cruel humour to engage his audience. He had a large political influence throughout the state, especially in Mumbai. His party never had any formal internal elections nor was he ever formally elected as its chief at any point. Gyan Prakash said, &quot;Of course, the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement had mobilized Marathi speakers as a political entity, but it was Thackeray who successfully deployed it as an anti-immigrant, populist force.&quot;
He inspired Baliram Kashyap the leader of Bastar who often regarded as the Thackeray of Bastar.

A memorial for him was proposed at Shivaji Park but legal issues and opposition from local residents continue to delay it.

Thackeray is satirised in Salman Rushdie&#x27;s 1995 novel &quot;The Moor&#x27;s Last Sigh&quot; as &#x27;Raman Fielding&#x27;. The book was banned by the Maharashtra state government. Suketu Mehta interviewed Thackeray in his critically acclaimed, Pulitzer-nominated, non-fiction 2004 book &quot;Maximum City&quot;. 

== In popular culture ==
In 2005, Ram Gopal Varma directed the Godfatheresque-Sarkar, super-hit thriller was inspired by the life of Bal Thackeray and North Indian politics. In this Amitabh Bachchan&#x27;s character was inspired by Thackeray 

The 2011 documentary &quot;Jai Bhim Comrade&quot; depicted a speech by Thackeray at a public rally, in which he articulated &quot;genocidal sentiments&quot; about Muslims, stating that they were the &quot;species to be exterminated.&quot; The documentary followed this by showing several Dalit leaders criticising Thackeray for his beliefs.

Balkadu a 2015 Marathi film is loosely expected to be based on the ideologies of Bal Thackeray, the film contains voice clippings of Thackeray&#x27;s political career.

A Bollywood biopic titled &quot;Thackeray&quot;, starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui and written by Shiv Sena politician Sanjay Raut, was released on 25 January 2019.

Makarand Padhye played Balasaheb Thakeray in the 2022 Marathi film Dharmaveer and its sequel based on the life of Shiv Sena politician Anand Dighe.

Dushyant Wagh played Thackeray in the 2023 Marathi film Maharashtra Shahir based on the life of Padma Shri Shahir Sable.

<doc id="3789" wikidata="Q157246" url="?curid=3789" title="Bitola">
<text>Bitola (; ) is a city in the southwestern part of North Macedonia. It is located in the southern part of the Pelagonia valley, surrounded by the Baba, Nidže, and Kajmakčalan mountain ranges, north of the Medžitlija-Níki border crossing with Greece. The city stands at an important junction connecting the south of the Adriatic Sea region with the Aegean Sea and Central Europe, and it is an administrative, cultural, industrial, commercial, and educational centre. It has been known since the Ottoman period as the &quot;City of Consuls&quot;, since many European countries had consulates in Bitola.

Bitola, known during the Ottoman Empire as Manastır or Monastir, is one of the oldest cities in North Macedonia. It was founded as Heraclea Lyncestis in the middle of the 4th century BC by Philip II of Macedon. The city was the last capital of the First Bulgarian Empire (1015–1018) and the last capital of Ottoman Rumelia, from 1836 to 1867. According to the 2002 census, Bitola is the third largest city in the country, after the capital Skopje and Kumanovo. Bitola is also the seat of the Bitola Municipality.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Bitola&quot; is derived from the Old Church Slavonic word ѡ҆би́тѣл҄ь (&quot;obitěĺь&quot;, meaning &quot;monastery&quot; or &quot;cloister&quot;), literally &quot;abode,&quot; as the city was formerly noted for its monastery. When the meaning of the name was no longer understood, it lost its prefix &quot;o-&quot;. The name &quot;Bitola&quot; is mentioned in the Bitola inscription, related to the old city fortress built in 1015 during the ruling of Gavril Radomir of Bulgaria (1014–1015) when Bitola served as capital of the First Bulgarian Empire. Modern Slavic variants include the Macedonian (), the Serbian () and Bulgarian (). In Byzantine times, the name was Hellenized to () or (), hence the names &quot;Butella&quot; used by William of Tyre and &quot;Butili&quot; by the Arab geographer al-Idrisi.

The Modern Greek name for the city (, ), also meaning &quot;monastery&quot;, is a calque of the Slavic name. The Turkish name () is derived from the Greek name, as is the Albanian name (), and the Ladino name ( ). The Aromanian name, or alternatively, , is derived from the same root as the Macedonian name.

==Geography==
Bitola is located in the southwestern part of North Macedonia. The Dragor River flows through the city. Bitola lies at an elevation of 615 metres above sea level, at the foot of Baba Mountain. Its magnificent Pelister mountain (2,601 m) is a national park with exquisite flora and fauna, among which is the rarest species of pine, known as Macedonian pine or pinus peuce. It is also the location of a well-known ski resort.

Covering an area of and with a population of 122,173 (1991), Bitola is an important industrial, agricultural, commercial, educational and cultural centre. It represents an important junction that connects the Adriatic Sea to the south with the Aegean Sea and Central Europe.

==Climate==
Bitola has a mildly continental climate typical of the Pelagonija region, experiencing very warm and dry summers, and cold and snowy winters. The Köppen climate classification for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot;, which would be an oceanic climate, going by the original threshold.

==History==
===Prehistory===
There are a number of prehistoric archaeological sites around Bitola. The earliest evidence of organized human settlements are the archaeological sites from the early Neolithic period, among which the most important are the tells of Veluška Tumba and Bara Tumba near the village of Porodin, first inhabited around 6000 BC.

===Ancient and early Byzantine periods===
The region of Bitola was known as Lynkestis in antiquity, a region that became part of Upper Macedonia, and was ruled by semi-independent chieftains until the later Argead rulers of Macedon. The tribes of Lynkestis were known as &quot;Lynkestai&quot;. According to Nicholas Hammond, they were a Greek tribe belonging to the Molossian group of the Epirotes. There are important metal artifacts from the ancient period at the necropolis of Crkvište near the village of Beranci. A golden earring dating from the 4th century BC is depicted on the obverse of the Macedonian 10-denar banknote, issued in 1996.

Heraclea Lyncestis ( - &quot;City of Hercules upon the Land of the Lynx&quot;) was an important settlement from the Hellenistic period till the early Middle Ages. It was founded by Philip II of Macedon by the middle of the 4th century BC, and named after the Greek hero Heracles. With its strategic location, it became a prosperous city. The Romans conquered this part of Macedon in 148 BC and destroyed the political power of the city. However, its prosperity continued mainly due to the Roman Via Egnatia road which passed near the city. A number of archaeological monuments from the Roman period can be seen today in Heraclea, including a portico, thermae (baths), a theater. The theatre was once capable of housing an audience of around 2,500 people.

In the early Byzantine period (4th to 6th centuries AD) Heraclea became an important episcopal centre. Some of its bishops were mentioned in the acts of the first Church Councils, including Bishop Evagrius of Heraclea in the Acts of the Sardica Council of 343. The city walls, a number of Early Christian basilicas, the bishop&#x27;s residence, and a lavish city fountain are some of the remains of this period. The floors in the three naves of the Great Basilica are covered with mosaics with a very rich floral and figurative iconography; these well preserved mosaics are often regarded as one of the finest examples of the early Christian art in the region. During the 4th and 6th centuries, the names of other bishops from Heraclea were recorded. The city was sacked by Ostrogothic forces, commanded by Theodoric the Great in 472 AD and, despite a large gift to him from the city&#x27;s bishop, it was sacked again in 479. It was restored in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. However, in the late 6th century the city suffered successive attacks by various tribes, and eventually the region was settled by the early Slavic peoples. Its imperial buildings fell into disrepair and the city gradually declined to a small settlement, and survived as such until around the 11th century AD.

===Middle Ages===
In the 6th and 7th centuries, the region around Bitola experienced a demographic shift as more and more Slavic tribes settled in the area. In place of the deserted theater, several houses were built during that time. The Slavs also built a fortress around their settlement. Bitola was a part of the First Bulgarian Empire from the middle of the 8th to the early 11th centuries, after which it again became part of the Byzantine Empire, and in turn was briefly part of the Serbian Empire during the 14th century. Arguably, a number of monasteries and churches were built in and around the city during the Medieval period (hence its other name &quot;Manastir&quot;).
In the 10th century, Bitola came under the rule of tsar Samuel of Bulgaria. He built a castle in the town, later used by his successor Gavril Radomir of Bulgaria. The town is mentioned in several medieval sources. John Skylitzes&#x27;s 11th-century chronicle mentions that Emperor Basil II burned Gavril&#x27;s castle in Bitola, when passing through and ravaging Pelagonia. The second chrysobull (1019) of Basil II mentioned that the Bishop of Bitola depended on the Archbishopric of Ohrid. During the reign of Samuil, the city was the seat of the Bitola Bishopric. In many medieval sources, especially Western, the name &quot;Pelagonia&quot; was synonymous with the Bitola Bishopric. According to some sources, Bitola was known as Heraclea since what once was the Heraclea Bishopric later became the Pelagonian Metropolitan&#x27;s Diocese. In 1015, Tsar Gavril Radomir was killed by his cousin Ivan Vladislav, who then declared himself tsar and rebuilt the city&#x27;s fortress. To commemorate the occasion, a stone inscription written in the Cyrillic alphabet was set in the fortress; in it the Slavic name of the city is mentioned: Bitol.

During the battle of Bitola in 1015 between a Bulgarian army under the command of the voivode Ivats and a Byzantine army led by the &quot;strategos&quot; George Gonitsiates, the Bulgarians were victorious and the Byzantine Emperor Basil II had to retreat from the Bulgarian capital Ohrid, whose outer walls were by that time already breached by the Bulgarians. Afterwards Ivan Vladislav moved the capital from Ohrid to Bitola, where he re-erected the fortress. However, the Bulgarian victory only postponed the fall of Bulgaria to Byzantine rule in 1018.

As a military, political and religious center, Bitola played a very important role in the life of the medieval society in the region, prior to the Ottoman conquest in the mid-14th century. On the eve of the Ottoman conquest, Bitola (Monastir in Ottoman Turkish) experienced great growth with its well-established trading links all over the Balkan Peninsula, especially with big economic centers like Constantinople, Thessalonica, Ragusa and Tarnovo. Caravans carrying various goods came and went from Bitola.

===Ottoman rule===




From 1382 to 1912, Bitola was part of the Ottoman Empire, and was known as Monastir. Fierce battles took place near the city during the Ottoman conquest. Ottoman rule was completely established after the death of Prince Marko in 1395 when the Ottoman Empire established the Sanjak of Ohrid as a part of the Rumelia Eyalet and one of the earliest established sanjaks in Europe. Before it became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1395, Bitola was part of the realm of Prince Marko. Initially, its county town was Bitola and later it was Ohrid, so it was sometimes referred to as the Sanjak of Monastir and sometimes as the Sanjak of Bitola.

After the Austro-Ottoman wars, the trade development and the overall prosperity of the city declined. But in the late 19th century, it again became the second-largest city in the wider southern Balkan region after Thessaloniki.

Between 1815 and 1822, the town was ruled by the Albanian Ali Pasha as part of the Pashalik of Yanina.

During the Great Eastern Crisis, the local Bulgarian movement of the day was defeated when armed Bulgarian groups were repelled by the League of Prizren, an Albanian organisation opposing Bulgarian geopolitical aims in areas like Bitola that contained an Albanian population. Nevertheless, in April 1881, an Ottoman army captured Prizren and suppressed the League&#x27;s rebellion.

In 1874, Manastır became the center of Monastir Vilayet which included the sanjaks of Debra, Serfidze, Elbasan, Manastır (Bitola), Görice and the towns of Kırcaova, Pirlepe, Florina, Kesriye and Grevena.

Traditionally a strong trading center, Bitola was also known as &quot;the city of the consuls&quot;. In the final period of Ottoman rule (1878–1912), Bitola had consulates from twelve countries. During the same period, there were a number of prestigious schools in the city, including a military academy that, among others, was attended by the Turkish reformer Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. In 1883, there were 19 schools in Monastir, of which 11 were Greek, 5 were Bulgarian and 3 were Romanian. In Bitola, besides the schools where Ottomanism and Turkism flourished in the 19th century, schools of various nations were also opened. These institutions, which were very effective in increasing the education level and the rate of literacy, caused the formation of a circle of intellectuals in Bitola. Bitola was also the headquarters of many cultural organizations at that time.

In 1894, Manastır was connected with Thessaloniki by train. The first motion picture made in the Balkans was produced by the Aromanian Manakis brothers in Manastır in 1903. In their honour, the annual Manaki Brothers International Cinematographers Film Festival is held in Bitola since 1979.

In November 1905, the Secret Committee for the Liberation of Albania, a secret organization formed to fight for the liberation of Albania from the Ottoman Empire, was founded by Bajo Topulli and other Albanian nationalists and intellectuals. Three years later, the Congress of Manastir of 1908, which standardized the modern Albanian alphabet, was held in the city. The congress was held at the house of Fehim Zavalani. Mit&#x27;hat Frashëri was chairman of the congress. The participants in the Congress were prominent figures from the cultural and political life of Albanian-inhabited territories in the Balkans, and the Albanian diaspora.

===Ilinden Uprising===
The Bitola region was a stronghold of the Ilinden Uprising. The uprising was conceived in 1903 in Thessaloniki by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO). The uprising in the Bitola region was planned in Smilevo village in May 1903. Battles were fought in the villages of Bistrica, Rakovo, Buf, Skocivir, Paralovo, Brod, Novaci, Smilevo, Gjavato, Capari and others. Smilevo was defended by 600 rebels led by Dame Gruev and Georgi Sugarev. They were defeated and the villages were burned.

===Balkan Wars===
In 1912, Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece fought the Ottomans in the First Balkan War. After a victory at Sarantaporo, Greek troops advanced towards Monastir but were defeated by the Ottomans at Sorovich. The Battle of Monastir (16–19 November 1912) led to Serbian occupation of the city. According to the Treaty of Bucharest, 1913, the region of Macedonia was divided into three parts among Greece, Serbia and Bulgaria. Monastir was ceded to Serbia and its official name became the Slavic toponym &quot;Bitola&quot;.

===World War I===
During World War I Bitola was on the Salonica front. Bulgaria, a Central Power, took the city on 21 November 1915, while the Allied forces recaptured it in 1916. Bitola was divided into French, Russian, Italian and Serbian sections, under the command of French general Maurice Sarrail. Until Bulgaria&#x27;s surrender in late autumn 1918, Bitola remained a front line city and was bombarded almost daily by air bombardment and artillery fire and was nearly destroyed.

===Inter-war period===
At the end of World War I Bitola was restored to the Kingdom of Serbia, and, consequently, in 1918 became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was renamed Yugoslavia in 1929. Bitola became one of the major cities of the Vardarska banovina.

===World War II===
During World War II (1939–45), the Germans (on 9 April 1941) and Bulgarians (on 18 April 1941) took control of the city. But in September 1944, Bulgaria switched sides in the war and withdrew from Yugoslavia. On 4 November, the 7th Macedonian Liberation Brigade entered Bitola after the German withdrawal. The historical Jewish community, of Sephardic origin, lived in the city until World War II, when some were able to immigrate to the United States and Chile. On 11 March 1943 the Bulgarians deported the vast majority of the Jewish population (3,276 Jews) to Treblinka extermination camp. After the end of the war, PR Macedonia was established within FPR Yugoslavia.

===Socialist Yugoslavia===

In 1945, the first Gymnasium (named &quot;Josip Broz Tito&quot;) to use the Macedonian language, was opened in Bitola. In 1951–52, as part of an education campaign total of 40 Turkish schools were opened in Debar, Kičevo, Kumanovo, Struga, Resen, Bitola, Kruševo and Prilep.

==Main sights==

The city has many historical building dating from many historical periods. The most notable ones are from the Ottoman age, but there are some from the more recent past.

===Širok Sokak===

Širok Sokak (, meaning &quot;Wide Alley&quot;) is a long pedestrian street that runs from Magnolia Square to the City Park.
===Clock Tower===


It is unknown when Bitola&#x27;s clock tower was built. Written sources from the 16th century mention a clock tower, but it is unclear if it is the same. Some believe it was built at the same time as St. Dimitrija Church in 1830. Legend says that the Ottoman authorities collected around 60,000 eggs from nearby villages and mixed them in the mortar to make the walls stronger.

The tower has a rectangular base and is about 30 meters high. Near the top is a rectangular terrace with an iron fence. On each side of the fence is an iron console construction which holds the lamps for lighting the clock. The clock is on the highest of three levels. The original clock was replaced during World War II with a working one, given by the Nazis because the city had maintained German graves from World War I.
The massive tower is composed of walls, massive spiral stairs, wooden mezzanine constructions, pendentives and the dome. During the construction of the tower, the façade was simultaneously decorated with simple stone plastic.

===Church of Saint Demetrius===
The Church of Saint Demetrius was built in 1830 with the voluntary contributions of local merchants and craftsmen. It is plain on the outside, as all churches in the Ottoman Empire had to be, but lavishly decorated with chandeliers, a carved bishop throne and an engraved iconostasis on the inside. According to some theories, iconostasis is a work of the Mijak engravers. Its most impressive feature is the arc above the imperial quarters with modelled figures of Jesus and the apostles.

Other engraved wood items include the bishop&#x27;s throne made in the spirit of Mijak engravers, several icon frames and five more-recent pillars shaped like thrones. The frescoes originate from two periods: the end of the 19th century and the end of World War I to the present. The icons and frescoes were created thanks to voluntary contributions of local businessmen and citizens. The authors of many of the icons had a vast knowledge of iconography schemes of the New Testament. The icons show a great sense of color, dominated by red, green and ochra shades. The abundance of golden ornaments is noticeable and points to the presence of late-Byzantine artwork and baroque style. The icon of Saint Demetrius is signed with the initials &quot;D. A. Z.&quot;, showing that it was made by iconographer Dimitar Andonov the zograph in 1889. There are many other items, including the chalices made by local masters, a darohranilka of Russian origin, and several paintings of scenes from the New Testament, brought from Jerusalem by pilgrims.

The opening scenes of the film &quot;The Peacemaker&quot; were shot in the &quot;Saint Dimitrija&quot; church in Bitola, as well as some &quot;Welcome to Sarajevo&quot; scenes.

===Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart===
===Heraclea Lyncestis===
Heraclea Lyncestis () was an important ancient settlement from the Hellenistic period till the early Middle Ages. It was founded by Philip II of Macedon by the middle of the 4th century BC. Today, its ruins are in the southern part of Bitola, from the city center.

===The covered bazaar===
Situated near the city centre, the covered bedisten () is one of the most impressive and oldest buildings in Bitola from the Ottoman period. With its numerous cupolas that look like a fortress, with its tree-branch-like inner streets and four large metal doors it is one of the biggest covered markets in the region.

It was built in the 15th century by Kara Daut Pasha Uzuncarsili, then Rumelia&#x27;s Beylerbey. Although the bazaar appears secure, it has been robbed and set on fire, but has managed to survive. The bedisten, from the 15th to the 19th centuries, was rebuilt, and many stores, often changing over time, were located there. Most of them were selling textile and other luxurious fabrics. At the same time the Bedisten was a treasury, where in specially made small rooms the money from the whole Rumelian Vilaet was kept, before it was transferred into the royal treasury. In the 19th century the Bedisten contained 84 shops. Today most of them are contemporary and they sell different types of products, but despite the internal renovations, the outwards appearance of the structure has remained unchanged.

===Gazi Hajdar Kadi Mosque===
The Gazi Hajdar Kadi Mosque is one of the most attractive monuments of Islamic architecture in Bitola. It was built in the early 1560s, as the project of the architect Mimar Sinan, ordered by the Bitola kadija Ajdar-kadi. Over time, it was abandoned and heavily damaged, and at one point used as a stare, but recent restoration and conservation has restored to some extent its original appearance.

===New Mosque, Bitola===

The New Mosque is located in the center of the city. It has a square base, topped with a dome. Near the mosque is a minaret, 40 m high. Today, the mosque&#x27;s rooms house permanent and temporary art exhibitions. Recent archaeological excavations have revealed that it has been built upon an old church.

===Ishak Çelebi Mosque===
The Ishak Çelebi Mosque is the inheritance of the kadi Ishak Çelebi. In its spacious yard are several tombs, attractive because of the soft, molded shapes of the sarcophagi.

===Kodža Kadi Mosque===
===The old bazaar===
The old bazaar (Macedonian: &quot;Стара Чаршија&quot;) is mentioned in a description of the city from the 16th and the 17th centuries. The present bedisten does not differ much in appearance from the original one. The bedisten had eighty-six shops and four large iron gates. The shops used to sell textiles, and today sell food products.

===Deboj Bath===
The Deboj Bath is an Ottoman Empire-era hamam. It is not known when exactly it was constructed. At one point, it was heavily damaged, but after repairs it regained its original appearance: a façade with two large domes and several minor ones.

==Demographics==
;Ethnic groups
Bitola&#x27;s population was historically diverse. It numbered some 37,500 at the end of the 19th century. There were around 7,000 Aromanians, most of whom fully embraced the Hellenic culture, although some preferred the Romanian culture. Bitola also had a significant Muslim population - 11,000 (Turks, Roma, and Albanians) as well as a Jewish community of 5,200. The Slavic-speakers were divided between the Bulgarian Exarchate - 8,000, and the Greek Patriarchate - 6,300. A significant part of the Muslim Albanian population of Bitola was Turkified during Ottoman rule.
In statistics gathered by Vasil Kanchov in 1900, the city of Bitola was inhabited by 37,000 people, of whom 10,500 were Turks, 10,000 Christian Bulgarians, 7,000 Vlachs, 2,000 Romani, 5,500 Jews, 1,500 Muslim Albanians, 500 inhabitants of various other origins. The Bulgarian researcher Vasil Kanchov wrote in 1900 that many Albanians declared themselves as Turks. In Bitola, the population that declared itself Turkish &quot;was of Albanian blood&quot;, but it &quot;had been Turkified after the Ottoman invasion, including Skanderbeg&quot;, referring to Islamization.

During Ottoman times, Bitola had a significant Aromanian population, which according to some sources was larger than the Bulgarian and Jewish ones. In 1901, the Italian consul to the Ottoman Empire in Bitola said that &quot;Undoubtedly, Koutzo-Vlach [Aromanian] population in Bitola is most significant in this town in terms of number of inhabitants, social status and importance in trade&quot;.

According to the statistics of the secretary of the Bulgarian Exarchate, Dimitar Mishev (&quot; La Macédoine et sa Population Chrétienne &quot;), in 1905 the Christian population of Bitola consisted of 8,844 Bulgarian Exarchists, 6,300 Greek Patriarchal Bulgarians, 72 Serboman Patriarchal Bulgarians, 36 Protestant Bulgarians, 100 Greeks, 7,200 Vlachs, 120 Albanians and 120 Gypsies. In the city there are 10 primary and 3 secondary Bulgarian schools, 7 primary and 2 secondary Greek, 2 primary and 2 secondary Romanian and 1 primary and 2 secondary Serbian schools.

According to a 1911 Ottoman census, there were 350,000 Greeks, 246,000 Bulgarians and 456,000 Muslims in the vilayet of Manastır, however the basis of the Ottoman censuses was the millet system where people were assigned an ethnicity according to their religion. Therefore, all Sunni Muslims were categorised as &quot;Turks&quot; even though many of them were Albanians, while all members of the Greek Orthodox church were listed as &quot;Greeks&quot; although this group was composed of Aromanians, Slavs, and Tosk Albanians, in addition to the Greeks which were numbered at ~100,000. The Slavic-speakers were divided between the Bulgarian majority and a small Serbian minority.

Bulgarian ethnographer Jordan Ivanov, professor at the University of Sofia, wrote in 1915 that Albanians, since they did not have their own alphabet, lacked a consolidated national consciousness and were influenced by foreign propaganda, declared themselves as Turks, Greeks and Bulgarians, depending on which religion they belonged to. Ivan further stated that Albanians were losing their mother tongue in Bitola. German linguist Gustav Weigand describes the process of Turkification of the Albanian urban population in his 1923 work &quot;Ethnographie Makedoniens&quot; (Ethnography of Macedonia). He writes that in the cities, especially noting Bitola, many of the Turkish inhabitants are in fact Albanians, being distinguished by the difference in articulation of certain Turkish words, as well as their clothing and tool use. They speak Albanian at home, however use Turkish when in public. They refer to themselves as &quot;Turks&quot;, the term at the time also being a synonym for &quot;Muslim&quot;, with ethnic Turks referring to them as &quot;Turkoshak&quot;, a derogatory term for someone portraying themselves as Turkish.

According to the 1948 census Bitola had 30,761 inhabitants. 77.2% (or 23,734 inhabitants) were Macedonians, 11.5% (or 3,543 inhabitants) were Turks, 4.3% (or 1,327 inhabitants) were Albanians, 3% (or 912 inhabitants) were Serbs and 1.3% (or 402 inhabitants) were Aromanians. As of 2021, the city of Bitola has 69,287 inhabitants and the ethnic composition is the following:

In the 1953 census, large portions of Albanians declared themselves as ethnic Turks. In the municipality of Bitola, 13,166 Albanians were registered in 1948 and 4,014 in 1953, with the Turkish community going from 14,050 members in 1948, to numbering 29,151 in 1953.

<text>The Battle of Bosworth or Bosworth Field ( ) was the last significant battle of the Wars of the Roses, the civil war between the houses of Lancaster and York that extended across England in the latter half of the 15th century. Fought on 22 August 1485, the battle was won by an alliance of Lancastrians and disaffected Yorkists. Their leader Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, became the first English monarch of the Tudor dynasty by his victory and subsequent marriage to a Yorkist princess. His opponent Richard III, the last king of the House of York, was killed during the battle, the last English monarch to fall in battle. Historians consider Bosworth Field to mark the end of the Plantagenet dynasty, making it one of the defining moments of English history.

Richard&#x27;s reign began in 1483 when he ascended the throne after his twelve-year-old nephew, Edward V, was declared illegitimate. The boy and his younger brother Richard soon disappeared, and their fate remains a mystery. Across the English Channel Henry Tudor, a descendant of the greatly diminished House of Lancaster, seized on Richard&#x27;s difficulties and laid claim to the throne. Henry&#x27;s first attempt to invade England in 1483 foundered in a storm, but his second arrived unopposed on 7 August 1485 on the southwest coast of Wales. Marching inland, Henry gathered support as he made for London. Richard hurriedly mustered his troops and intercepted Henry&#x27;s army near Ambion Hill, south of the town of Market Bosworth in Leicestershire. Lord Stanley and Sir William Stanley also brought a force to the battlefield, but held back while they decided which side it would be most advantageous to support, initially lending only four knights to Henry&#x27;s cause; these were: Sir Robert Tunstall, Sir John Savage (nephew of Lord Stanley), Sir Hugh Persall and Sir Humphrey Stanley. Sir John Savage was placed in command of the left flank of Henry&#x27;s army.

Richard divided his army, which outnumbered Henry&#x27;s, into three groups (or &quot;battles&quot;). One was assigned to the Duke of Norfolk and another to the Earl of Northumberland. Henry kept most of his force together and placed it under the command of the experienced Earl of Oxford. Richard&#x27;s vanguard, commanded by Norfolk, attacked but struggled against Oxford&#x27;s men, and some of Norfolk&#x27;s troops fled the field. Northumberland took no action when signalled to assist his king, so Richard gambled everything on a charge across the battlefield to kill Henry and end the fight. Seeing the king&#x27;s knights separated from his army, the Stanleys intervened; Sir William led his men to Henry&#x27;s aid, surrounding and killing Richard. After the battle, Henry was crowned king.

Henry hired chroniclers to portray his reign favourably; the Battle of Bosworth Field was popularised to represent his Tudor dynasty as the start of a new age, marking the end of the Middle Ages for England. From the 15th to the 18th centuries the battle was glamourised as a victory of good over evil, and features as the climax of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot;. The exact site of the battle is disputed because of the lack of conclusive data, and memorials have been erected at different locations. The Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre was built in 1974, on a site that has since been challenged by several scholars and historians. In October 2009, a team of researchers who had performed geological surveys and archaeological digs in the area since 2003 suggested a location southwest of Ambion Hill.

==Background==

During the 15th century civil war raged across England as the Houses of York and Lancaster fought each other for the English throne. In 1471 the Yorkists defeated their rivals in the battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury. The Lancastrian King Henry VI and his only son, Edward of Westminster, died in the aftermath of the Battle of Tewkesbury. Their deaths left the House of Lancaster with no direct claimants to the throne. The Yorkist king, Edward IV, was in complete control of England. He attainted those who refused to submit to his rule, such as Jasper Tudor and his nephew Henry, naming them traitors and confiscating their lands. The Tudors tried to flee to France but strong winds forced them to land in Brittany, which was a semi-independent duchy, where they were taken into the custody of Duke Francis II. Henry&#x27;s mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort, was a great-granddaughter of John of Gaunt, uncle of King Richard II and father of King Henry IV. The Beauforts were originally bastards, but Richard II legitimised them through an Act of Parliament, a decision quickly modified by a royal decree of Henry IV ordering that their descendants were not eligible to inherit the throne. Henry Tudor, the only remaining Lancastrian noble with a trace of the royal bloodline, had a weak claim to the throne, and Edward regarded him as &quot;a nobody&quot;. The Duke of Brittany, however, viewed Henry as a valuable tool to bargain for England&#x27;s aid in conflicts with France, and kept the Tudors under his protection.

Edward IV died 12 years after Tewkesbury in April 1483. His 12-year-old elder son succeeded him as King Edward V; the younger son, nine-year-old Richard of Shrewsbury, was next in line to the throne. Edward V was too young to rule and a Royal Council was established to rule the country until the king&#x27;s coming of age. Some among the council were worried when it became apparent that the relatives of Edward V&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth Woodville, were plotting to use their control of the young king to dominate the council. Having offended many in their quest for wealth and power, the Woodville family was not popular. To frustrate the Woodvilles&#x27; ambitions, Lord Hastings and other members of the council turned to the new king&#x27;s uncle—Richard, Duke of Gloucester, brother of Edward IV. The courtiers urged Gloucester to assume the role of Protector quickly, as had been previously requested by his now dead brother. On 29 April Gloucester, accompanied by a contingent of guards and Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, took Edward V into custody and arrested several prominent members of the Woodville family. After bringing the young king to London, Gloucester had the Queen&#x27;s brother Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, and her son by her first marriage Richard Grey executed, without trial, on charges of treason.

On 13 June, Gloucester accused Hastings of plotting with the Woodvilles and had him beheaded. Nine days later the Three Estates of the Realm, an informal Parliament declared the marriage between Edward IV and Elizabeth illegal, rendering their children illegitimate and disqualifying them from the throne. With his brother&#x27;s children out of the way, he was next in the line of succession and was proclaimed King Richard III on 26 June. The timing and extrajudicial nature of the deeds done to obtain the throne for Richard won him no popularity, and rumours that spoke ill of the new king spread throughout England. After they were declared bastards, the two princes were confined in the Tower of London and never seen in public again.

In October 1483, a conspiracy emerged to displace him from the throne. The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper. Their plans were coordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry&#x27;s mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son as a candidate for the throne. The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham. No chronicles tell of the duke&#x27;s motive in joining the plot, although historian Charles Ross proposes that Buckingham was trying to distance himself from a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular with the people. Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into thinking the rebels supported him to be king.
The plan was to stage uprisings within a short time in southern and western England, overwhelming Richard&#x27;s forces. Buckingham would support the rebels by invading from Wales, while Henry came in by sea. Bad timing and weather wrecked the plot. An uprising in Kent started 10 days prematurely, alerting Richard to muster the royal army and take steps to put down the insurrections. Richard&#x27;s spies informed him of Buckingham&#x27;s activities, and the king&#x27;s men captured and destroyed the bridges across the River Severn. When Buckingham and his army reached the river, they found it swollen and impossible to cross because of a violent storm that broke on 15 October. Buckingham was trapped and had no safe place to retreat; his Welsh enemies seized his home castle after he had set forth with his army. The duke abandoned his plans and fled to Wem, where he was betrayed by his servant and arrested by Richard&#x27;s men. On 2 November he was executed. Henry had attempted a landing on 10 October (or 19 October), but his fleet was scattered by a storm. He reached the coast of England (at either Plymouth or Poole) and a group of soldiers hailed him to come ashore. They were, in fact, Richard&#x27;s men, prepared to capture Henry once he set foot on English soil. Henry was not deceived and returned to Brittany, abandoning the invasion. Without Buckingham or Henry, the rebellion was easily crushed by Richard.

The survivors of the failed uprisings fled to Brittany, where they openly supported Henry&#x27;s claim to the throne. At Christmas, Henry Tudor swore an oath in Rennes Cathedral to marry Edward IV&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth of York, to unite the warring houses of York and Lancaster. Henry&#x27;s rising prominence made him a great threat to Richard, and the Yorkist king made several overtures to the Duke of Brittany to surrender the young Lancastrian. Francis refused, holding out for the possibility of better terms from Richard. In mid-1484 Francis was incapacitated by illness and while recuperating, his treasurer Pierre Landais took over the reins of government. Landais reached an agreement with Richard to send back Henry and his uncle in exchange for military and financial aid. John Morton, a bishop of Flanders, learned of the scheme and warned the Tudors, who fled to France. The French court allowed them to stay; the Tudors were useful pawns to ensure that Richard&#x27;s England did not interfere with French plans to annex Brittany. On 16 March 1485 Richard&#x27;s queen, Anne Neville, died, and rumours spread across the country that she was murdered to pave the way for Richard to marry his niece, Elizabeth. Later findings though, showed that Richard had entered into negotiations to marry Joanna of Portugal and to marry off Elizabeth to Manuel, Duke of Beja. The gossip must have upset Henry across the English Channel. The loss of Elizabeth&#x27;s hand in marriage could unravel the alliance between Henry&#x27;s supporters who were Lancastrians and those who were loyalists to Edward IV. Anxious to secure his bride, Henry recruited mercenaries formerly in French service to supplement his following of exiles and set sail from France on 1 August.

==Factions==

By the 15th century, English chivalric ideas of selfless service to the king had been corrupted. Armed forces were raised mostly through musters in individual estates; every able-bodied man had to respond to his lord&#x27;s call to arms, and each noble had authority over his militia. Although a king could raise personal militia from his lands, he could muster a large army only through the support of his nobles. Richard, like his predecessors, had to win over these men by granting gifts and maintaining cordial relationships. Powerful nobles could demand greater incentives to remain on the liege&#x27;s side or else they might turn against him. Three groups, each with its own agenda, stood on Bosworth Field: Richard III and his Yorkist army; his challenger, Henry Tudor, who championed the Lancastrian cause; and the fence-sitting Stanleys.

===Yorkist===
Small and slender, Richard III did not have the robust physique associated with many of his Plantagenet predecessors. However, he enjoyed very rough sports and activities that were considered manly. His performances on the battlefield impressed his brother greatly, and he became Edward&#x27;s right-hand man. During the 1480s Richard defended the northern borders of England. In 1482, Edward charged him to lead an army into Scotland with the aim of replacing King James III with the Duke of Albany. Richard&#x27;s army broke through the Scottish defences and occupied the capital, Edinburgh, but Albany decided to give up his claim to the throne in return for the post of Lieutenant General of Scotland. As well as obtaining a guarantee that the Scottish government would concede territories and diplomatic benefits to the English crown, Richard&#x27;s campaign retook the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, which the Scots had conquered in 1460. Edward was not satisfied by these gains, which, according to Ross, could have been greater if Richard had been resolute enough to capitalise on the situation while in control of Edinburgh. In her analysis of Richard&#x27;s character, Christine Carpenter sees him as a soldier who was more used to taking orders than giving them. However, he was not averse to displaying his militaristic streak; on ascending the throne he made known his desire to lead a crusade against &quot;not only the Turks, but all [his] foes&quot;.

Richard&#x27;s most loyal subject was John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk. The duke had served Richard&#x27;s brother for many years and had been one of Edward IV&#x27;s closer confidants. He was a military veteran, having fought in the Battle of Towton in 1461 and served as Hastings&#x27; deputy at Calais in 1471. Ross speculates that he bore a grudge against Edward for depriving him of a fortune. Norfolk was due to inherit a share of the wealthy Mowbray estate on the death of eight-year-old Anne de Mowbray, the last of her family. However, Edward convinced Parliament to circumvent the law of inheritance and transfer the estate to his younger son, who was married to Anne. Consequently, Howard supported Richard III in deposing Edward&#x27;s sons, for which he received the dukedom of Norfolk and his original share of the Mowbray estate.

Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland, also supported Richard&#x27;s ascension to the throne of England. The Percys were loyal Lancastrians, but Edward IV eventually won the earl&#x27;s allegiance. Northumberland had been captured and imprisoned by the Yorkists in 1461, losing his titles and estates; however, Edward released him eight years later and restored his earldom. From that time Northumberland served the Yorkist crown, helping to defend northern England and maintain its peace. Initially the earl had issues with Richard III as Edward groomed his brother to be the leading power of the north. Northumberland was mollified when he was promised he would be the Warden of the East March, a position that was formerly hereditary for the Percys. He served under Richard during the 1482 invasion of Scotland, and the allure of being in a position to dominate the north of England if Richard went south to assume the crown was his likely motivation for supporting Richard&#x27;s bid for kingship. However, after becoming king, Richard began moulding his nephew, John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln, to manage the north, passing over Northumberland for the position. According to Carpenter, although the earl was amply compensated, he despaired of any possibility of advancement under Richard.

===Lancastrians===
Henry Tudor was unfamiliar with the arts of war and was a stranger to the land he was trying to conquer. He spent the first fourteen years of his life in Wales and the next fourteen in Brittany and France. Slender but strong and decisive, Henry lacked a penchant for battle and was not much of a warrior; chroniclers such as Polydore Vergil and ambassadors like Pedro de Ayala found him more interested in commerce and finance. Having not fought in any battles, Henry recruited several experienced veterans to command his armies. 

John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, was Henry&#x27;s principal military commander. He was adept in the arts of war. At the Battle of Barnet, he commanded the Lancastrian right wing and routed the division opposing him. However, as a result of confusion over identities, Oxford&#x27;s group came under friendly fire from the Lancastrian main force and retreated from the field. The earl fled abroad and continued his fight against the Yorkists, raiding shipping and eventually capturing the island fort of St Michael&#x27;s Mount in 1473. He surrendered after receiving no aid or reinforcement, but in 1484 escaped from prison and joined Henry&#x27;s court in France, bringing along his erstwhile gaoler Sir James Blount. Oxford&#x27;s presence raised morale in Henry&#x27;s camp and troubled Richard III.

===Stanleys===
In the early stages of the Wars of the Roses, the Stanleys of Cheshire had been predominantly Lancastrians. Sir William Stanley, however, was a staunch Yorkist supporter, fighting in the Battle of Blore Heath in 1459 and helping Hastings to put down uprisings against Edward IV in 1471. When Richard took the crown, Sir William showed no inclination to turn against the new king, refraining from joining Buckingham&#x27;s rebellion, for which he was amply rewarded. Sir William&#x27;s elder brother, Thomas Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley, was not as steadfast. By 1485, he had served three kings, namely Henry VI, Edward IV, and Richard III. Lord Stanley&#x27;s skilled political manoeuvrings—vacillating between opposing sides until it was clear who would be the winner—gained him high positions; he was Henry&#x27;s chamberlain and Edward&#x27;s steward. His non-committal stance, until the crucial point of a battle, earned him the loyalty of his men, who felt he would not needlessly send them to their deaths.

Lord Stanley&#x27;s relations with the king&#x27;s brother, the eventual Richard III, were not cordial. The two had conflicts that erupted into violence around March 1470. Furthermore, having taken Lady Margaret as his second wife in June 1472, Stanley was Henry Tudor&#x27;s stepfather, a relationship which did nothing to win him Richard&#x27;s favour. Despite these differences, Stanley did not join Buckingham&#x27;s revolt in 1483. When Richard executed those conspirators who had been unable to flee England, he spared Lady Margaret. However, he declared her titles forfeit and transferred her estates to Stanley&#x27;s name, to be held in trust for the Yorkist crown. Richard&#x27;s act of mercy was calculated to reconcile him with Stanley, but it may have been to no avail—Carpenter has identified a further cause of friction in Richard&#x27;s intention to reopen an old land dispute that involved Thomas Stanley and the Harrington family. Edward IV had ruled the case in favour of Stanley in 1473, but Richard planned to overturn his brother&#x27;s ruling and give the wealthy estate to the Harringtons. Immediately before the Battle of Bosworth, being wary of Stanley, Richard took his son, Lord Strange, as hostage to discourage him from joining Henry.

==Crossing the English Channel and through Wales==
Henry&#x27;s initial force consisted of the English and Welsh exiles who had gathered around Henry, combined with a contingent of mercenaries put at his disposal by Charles VIII of France. The history of Scottish author John Major (published in 1521) claims that Charles had granted Henry 5,000 men, of whom 1,000 were Scots, headed by Sir Alexander Bruce. No mention of Scottish soldiers was made by subsequent English historians.

Henry&#x27;s crossing of the English Channel in 1485 was without incident. Thirty ships sailed from Harfleur on 1 August and, with fair winds behind them, landed in his native Wales, at Mill Bay (near Dale) on the north side of Milford Haven on 7 August, easily capturing nearby Dale Castle. Henry received a muted response from the local population. No joyous welcome awaited him on shore, and at first few individual Welshmen joined his army as it marched inland. Historian Geoffrey Elton suggests only Henry&#x27;s ardent supporters felt pride over his Welsh blood. His arrival had been hailed by contemporary Welsh bards such as Dafydd Ddu and Gruffydd ap Dafydd as the true prince and &quot;the youth of Brittany defeating the Saxons&quot; in order to bring their country back to glory. When Henry moved to Haverfordwest, the county town of Pembrokeshire, Richard&#x27;s lieutenant in South Wales, Sir Walter Herbert, failed to move against Henry, and two of his officers, Richard Griffith and Evan Morgan, deserted to Henry with their men.

The most important defector to Henry in this early stage of the campaign was probably Rhys ap Thomas, who was the leading figure in West Wales. Richard had appointed Rhys Lieutenant in West Wales for his refusal to join Buckingham&#x27;s rebellion, asking that he surrender his son Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas as surety, although by some accounts Rhys had managed to evade this condition. However, Henry successfully courted Rhys, offering the lieutenancy of all Wales in exchange for his fealty. Henry marched via Aberystwyth while Rhys followed a more southerly route, recruiting a force of Welshmen en route, variously estimated at 500 or 2,000 men, to swell Henry&#x27;s army when they reunited at Cefn Digoll, Welshpool. By 15 or 16 August, Henry and his men had crossed the English border, making for the town of Shrewsbury.

==Shrewsbury: the gateway to England==

Since 22 June Richard had been aware of Henry&#x27;s impending invasion, and had ordered his lords to maintain a high level of readiness. News of Henry&#x27;s landing reached Richard on 11 August, but it took three to four days for his messengers to notify his lords of their king&#x27;s mobilisation. On 16 August, the Yorkist army started to gather; Norfolk set off for Leicester, the assembly point, that night. The city of York, a historical stronghold of Richard&#x27;s family, asked the king for instructions, and receiving a reply three days later sent 80 men to join the king. Simultaneously Northumberland, whose northern territory was the most distant from the capital, had gathered his men and ridden to Leicester.

Although London was his goal, Henry did not move directly towards the city. After resting in Shrewsbury, his forces went eastwards and picked up Sir Gilbert Talbot and other English allies, including deserters from Richard&#x27;s forces. Although its size had increased substantially since the landing, Henry&#x27;s army was still considerably outnumbered by Richard&#x27;s forces. Henry&#x27;s pace through Staffordshire was slow, delaying the confrontation with Richard so that he could gather more recruits to his cause. Henry had been communicating on friendly terms with the Stanleys for some time before setting foot in England, and the Stanleys had mobilised their forces on hearing of Henry&#x27;s landing. They ranged themselves ahead of Henry&#x27;s march through the English countryside, meeting twice in secret with Henry as he moved through Staffordshire. At the second of these, at Atherstone in Warwickshire, they conferred &quot;in what sort to arraign battle with King Richard, whom they heard to be not far off&quot;. On 21 August, the Stanleys were making camp on the slopes of a hill north of Dadlington, while Henry encamped his army at White Moors to the northwest of their camp.

On 20 August, Richard rode from Nottingham to Leicester, joining Norfolk. He spent the night at the Blue Boar inn (demolished 1836). Northumberland arrived the following day. The royal army proceeded westwards to intercept Henry&#x27;s march on London. Passing Sutton Cheney, Richard moved his army towards Ambion Hill—which he thought would be of tactical value—and made camp on it. Richard&#x27;s sleep was not peaceful and, according to the &quot;Croyland Chronicle&quot;, in the morning his face was &quot;more livid and ghastly than usual&quot;.

==Engagement==
The Yorkist army, variously estimated at between 7,500 and 12,000 men, deployed on the hilltop along the ridgeline from west to east. Norfolk&#x27;s force (or &quot;battle&quot; in the parlance of the time) of spearmen stood on the right flank, protecting the cannon and about 1,200 archers. Richard&#x27;s group, comprising 3,000 infantry, formed the centre. Northumberland&#x27;s men guarded the left flank; he had approximately 4,000 men, many of them mounted. Standing on the hilltop, Richard had a wide, unobstructed view of the area. He could see the Stanleys and their 4,000–6,000 men holding positions on and around Dadlington Hill, while to the southwest was Henry&#x27;s army.

Henry&#x27;s force has been variously estimated at between 5,000 and 8,000 men, his original landing force of exiles and mercenaries having been augmented by the recruits gathered in Wales and the English border counties (in the latter area probably mustered chiefly by the Talbot interest), and by deserters from Richard&#x27;s army. Historian John Mackie believes that 1,800 French mercenaries, led by Philibert de Chandée, formed the core of Henry&#x27;s army. John Mair, writing thirty-five years after the battle, claimed that this force contained a significant Scottish component, and this claim is accepted by some modern writers, but Mackie reasons that the French would not have released their elite Scottish knights and archers, and concludes that there were probably few Scottish troops in the army, although he accepts the presence of captains like Bernard Stewart, Lord of Aubigny.

In their interpretations of the vague mentions of the battle in the old text, historians placed areas near the foot of Ambion Hill as likely regions where the two armies clashed, and thought up possible scenarios of the engagement. In their recreations of the battle, Henry started by moving his army towards Ambion Hill where Richard and his men stood. As Henry&#x27;s army advanced past the marsh at the southwestern foot of the hill, Richard sent a message to Stanley, threatening to execute his son, Lord Strange, if Stanley did not join the attack on Henry immediately. Stanley replied that he had other sons. Incensed, Richard gave the order to behead Strange but his officers temporised, saying that battle was imminent, and it would be more convenient to carry out the execution afterwards. Henry had also sent messengers to Stanley asking him to declare his allegiance. The reply was evasive—the Stanleys would &quot;naturally&quot; come, after Henry had given orders to his army and arranged them for battle. Henry had no choice but to confront Richard&#x27;s forces alone.

Well aware of his own military inexperience, Henry handed command of his army to Oxford and retired to the rear with his bodyguards. Oxford, seeing the vast line of Richard&#x27;s army strung along the ridgeline, decided to keep his men together instead of splitting them into the traditional three battles: vanguard, centre, and rearguard. He ordered the troops to stray no further than from their banners, fearing that they would become enveloped. Individual groups clumped together, forming a single large mass flanked by horsemen on the wings.

The Lancastrians were harassed by Richard&#x27;s cannon as they manoeuvred around the marsh, seeking firmer ground. Once Oxford and his men were clear of the marsh, Norfolk&#x27;s battle and several contingents of Richard&#x27;s group, under the command of Sir Robert Brackenbury, started to advance. Hails of arrows showered both sides as they closed. Oxford&#x27;s men proved the steadier in the ensuing hand-to-hand combat; they held their ground and several of Norfolk&#x27;s men fled the field. Norfolk lost one of his senior officers, Walter Devereux, in this early clash.

Recognising that his force was at a disadvantage, Richard signalled for Northumberland to assist but Northumberland&#x27;s group showed no signs of movement. Historians, such as Horrox and Pugh, believe Northumberland chose not to aid his king for personal reasons. Ross doubts the aspersions cast on Northumberland&#x27;s loyalty, suggesting instead that Ambion Hill&#x27;s narrow ridge hindered him from joining the battle. The earl would have had to either go through his allies or execute a wide flanking move—near impossible to perform given the standard of drill at the time—to engage Oxford&#x27;s men.

At this juncture Richard saw Henry at some distance behind his main force. Seeing this, Richard decided to end the fight quickly by killing the enemy commander. He led a charge of mounted men around the melee and tore into Henry&#x27;s group; several accounts state that Richard&#x27;s force numbered 800–1000 knights, but Ross says it was more likely that Richard was accompanied only by his household men and closest friends. Richard killed Henry&#x27;s standard-bearer Sir William Brandon in the initial charge and unhorsed burly John Cheyne, Edward IV&#x27;s former standard-bearer, with a blow to the head from his broken lance. French mercenaries in Henry&#x27;s retinue related how the attack had caught them off guard and that Henry sought protection by dismounting and concealing himself among them to present less of a target. Henry made no attempt to engage in combat himself.

Oxford had left a small reserve of pike-equipped men with Henry. They slowed the pace of Richard&#x27;s mounted charge, and bought Tudor some critical time. The remainder of Henry&#x27;s bodyguards surrounded their master, and succeeded in keeping him away from the Yorkist king. Meanwhile, seeing Richard embroiled with Henry&#x27;s men and separated from his main force, William Stanley made his move and rode to the aid of Henry. Now outnumbered, Richard&#x27;s group was surrounded and gradually pressed back. Richard&#x27;s force was driven several hundred yards away from Tudor, near to the edge of a marsh, into which the king&#x27;s horse toppled. Richard, now unhorsed, gathered himself and rallied his dwindling followers, supposedly refusing to retreat: &quot;God forbid that I retreat one step. I will either win the battle as a king, or die as one.&quot; In the fighting Richard&#x27;s banner man—Sir Percival Thirlwall—lost his legs, but held the Yorkist banner aloft until he was killed. It is likely that James Harrington also died in the charge. The king&#x27;s trusted advisor Richard Ratcliffe was also slain.

Polydore Vergil, Henry Tudor&#x27;s official historian, recorded that &quot;King Richard, alone, was killed fighting manfully in the thickest press of his enemies&quot;. Richard had come within a sword&#x27;s length of Henry Tudor before being surrounded by William Stanley&#x27;s men and killed. The Burgundian chronicler Jean Molinet says that a Welshman struck the death-blow with a halberd while Richard&#x27;s horse was stuck in the marshy ground. It was said that the blows were so violent that the king&#x27;s helmet was driven into his skull. The contemporary Welsh poet Guto&#x27;r Glyn implies the leading Welsh Lancastrian Rhys ap Thomas, or one of his men, killed the king, writing that he (&quot;Killed the boar, shaved his head&quot;). Analysis of King Richard&#x27;s skeletal remains found 11 wounds, nine of them to the head; a blade consistent with a halberd had sliced off part of the rear of Richard&#x27;s skull, suggesting he had lost his helmet.

Richard&#x27;s forces disintegrated as news of his death spread. Northumberland and his men fled north on seeing the king&#x27;s fate, and Norfolk was killed by the knight Sir John Savage in single combat according to the Ballad of Lady Bessy.

==After the battle==

Although he claimed fourth-generation, maternal Lancastrian descendancy, Henry seized the crown by right of conquest. After the battle, Richard&#x27;s circlet is said to have been found and brought to Henry, who was proclaimed king at the top of Crown Hill, near the village of Stoke Golding. According to Vergil, Henry&#x27;s official historian, Lord Stanley found the circlet. Historians Stanley Chrimes and Sydney Anglo dismiss the legend of the circlet&#x27;s finding in a hawthorn bush; none of the contemporary sources reported such an event. Ross, however, does not ignore the legend. He argues that the hawthorn bush would not be part of Henry&#x27;s coat of arms if it did not have a strong relationship to his ascendance. Baldwin points out that a hawthorn bush motif was already used by the House of Lancaster, and Henry merely added the crown.

In Vergil&#x27;s chronicle, 100 of Henry&#x27;s men, compared to 1,000 of Richard&#x27;s, died in this battle—a ratio Chrimes believes to be an exaggeration. The bodies of the fallen were brought to St James Church at Dadlington for burial. However, Henry denied any immediate rest for Richard; instead the last Yorkist king&#x27;s corpse was stripped naked and strapped across a horse. His body was brought to Leicester and openly exhibited to prove that he was dead. Early accounts suggest that this was in the major Lancastrian collegiate foundation, the Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of the Newarke. After two days, the corpse was interred in a plain tomb, within the church of the Greyfriars. The church was demolished following the friary&#x27;s dissolution in 1538, and the location of Richard&#x27;s tomb was long uncertain.
On 12 September 2012, archaeologists announced the discovery of a buried skeleton with spinal abnormalities and head injuries under a car park in Leicester, and their suspicions that it was Richard III. On 4 February 2013, it was announced that DNA testing had convinced Leicester University scientists and researchers &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; that the remains were those of King Richard. On 26 March 2015, these remains were ceremonially buried in Leicester Cathedral. Richard&#x27;s tomb was unveiled on the following day.

Henry dismissed the mercenaries in his force, retaining only a small core of local soldiers to form a &quot;Yeomen of his Garde&quot;, and proceeded to establish his rule of England. Parliament reversed his attainder and recorded Richard&#x27;s kingship as illegal, although the Yorkist king&#x27;s reign remained officially in the annals of England history. The proclamation of Edward IV&#x27;s children as illegitimate was also reversed, restoring Elizabeth&#x27;s status to a royal princess. The marriage of Elizabeth, the heiress to the House of York, to Henry, the master of the House of Lancaster, marked the end of the feud between the two houses and the start of the Tudor dynasty. The royal matrimony, however, was delayed until Henry was crowned king and had established his claim on the throne firmly enough to preclude that of Elizabeth and her kin. Henry further convinced Parliament to backdate his reign to the day before the battle, enabling him retrospectively to declare as traitors those who had fought against him at Bosworth Field. Northumberland, who had remained inactive during the battle, was imprisoned but later released and reinstated to pacify the north in Henry&#x27;s name. Henry proved prepared to accept those who submitted to him regardless of their former allegiances.

Of his supporters, Henry rewarded the Stanleys the most generously. Aside from making William his chamberlain, he bestowed the earldom of Derby upon Lord Stanley along with grants and offices in other estates. Henry rewarded Oxford by restoring to him the lands and titles confiscated by the Yorkists and appointing him as Constable of the Tower and admiral of England, Ireland, and Aquitaine. For his kin, Henry created Jasper Tudor the Duke of Bedford. He returned to his mother the lands and grants stripped from her by Richard, and proved to be a filial son, granting her a place of honour in the palace and faithfully attending to her throughout his reign. Parliament&#x27;s declaration of Margaret as &quot;femme sole&quot; effectively empowered her; she no longer needed to manage her estates through Stanley. Elton points out that despite his initial largesse, Henry&#x27;s supporters at Bosworth would enjoy his special favour for only the short term; in later years, he would instead promote those who best served his interests.

Like the kings before him, Henry faced dissenters. The first open revolt occurred two years after Bosworth Field; Lambert Simnel claimed to be Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick, who was Edward IV&#x27;s nephew. The Earl of Lincoln backed him for the throne and led rebel forces in the name of the House of York. The rebel army fended off several attacks by Northumberland&#x27;s forces, before engaging Henry&#x27;s army at the Battle of Stoke Field on 16 June 1487. Oxford and Bedford led Henry&#x27;s men, including several former supporters of Richard III. Henry won this battle easily, but other malcontents and conspiracies would follow. A rebellion in 1489 started with Northumberland&#x27;s murder; military historian Michael C. C. Adams says that the author of a note, which was left next to Northumberland&#x27;s body, blamed the earl for Richard&#x27;s death.

==Legacy and historical significance==
Contemporary accounts of the Battle of Bosworth can be found in four main sources, one of which is the English &quot;Croyland Chronicle&quot;, written by a senior Yorkist chronicler who relied on second-hand information from nobles and soldiers. The other accounts were written by foreigners—Vergil, Jean Molinet, and Diego de Valera. Whereas Molinet was sympathetic to Richard, Vergil was in Henry&#x27;s service and drew information from the king and his subjects to portray them in a good light. Diego de Valera, whose information Ross regards as unreliable, compiled his work from letters of Spanish merchants. However, other historians have used Valera&#x27;s work to deduce possibly valuable insights not readily evident in other sources. Ross finds the poem, &quot;The Ballad of Bosworth Field&quot;, a useful source to ascertain certain details of the battle. The multitude of different accounts, mostly based on second- or third-hand information, has proved an obstacle to historians as they try to reconstruct the battle. Their common complaint is that, except for its outcome, very few details of the battle are found in the chronicles. According to historian Michael Hicks, the Battle of Bosworth is one of the worst-recorded clashes of the Wars of the Roses.

===Historical depictions and interpretations===

Henry tried to present his victory as a new beginning for the country; he hired chroniclers to portray his reign as a &quot;modern age&quot; with its dawn in 1485. Hicks states that the works of Vergil and the blind historian Bernard André, promoted by subsequent Tudor administrations, became the authoritative sources for writers for the next four hundred years. As such, Tudor literature paints a flattering picture of Henry&#x27;s reign, depicting the Battle of Bosworth as the final clash of the civil war and downplaying the subsequent uprisings. For England the Middle Ages ended in 1485, and English Heritage claims that other than William the Conqueror&#x27;s successful invasion of 1066, no other year holds more significance in English history. By portraying Richard as a hunchbacked tyrant who usurped the throne by killing his nephews, the Tudor historians attached a sense of myth to the battle: it became an epic clash between good and evil with a satisfying moral outcome. According to Reader Colin Burrow, André was so overwhelmed by the historic significance of the battle that he represented it with a blank page in his &quot;Henry VII&quot; (1502). For Professor Peter Saccio, the battle was indeed a unique clash in the annals of English history, because &quot;the victory was determined, not by those who fought, but by those who delayed fighting until they were sure of being on the winning side.&quot;

Historians such as Adams and Horrox believe that Richard lost the battle not for any mythic reasons, but because of morale and loyalty problems in his army. Most of the common soldiers found it difficult to fight for a liege whom they distrusted, and some lords believed that their situation might improve if Richard were dethroned. According to Adams, against such duplicities Richard&#x27;s desperate charge was the only knightly behaviour on the field. As fellow historian Michael Bennet puts it, the attack was &quot;the swan-song of [mediaeval] English chivalry&quot;. Adams believes this view was shared at the time by the printer William Caxton, who enjoyed sponsorship from Edward IV and Richard III. Nine days after the battle, Caxton published Thomas Malory&#x27;s story about chivalry and death by betrayal—&quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;—seemingly as a response to the circumstances of Richard&#x27;s death.

Elton does not believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, pointing out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry&#x27;s struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.

Mackie asserts that, in hindsight, Bosworth Field is notable as the decisive battle that established a dynasty which would rule unchallenged over England for more than a hundred years. Mackie notes that contemporary historians of that time, wary of the three royal successions during the long Wars of the Roses, considered Bosworth Field just another in a lengthy series of such battles. It was through the works and efforts of Francis Bacon and his successors that the public started to believe the battle had decided their futures by bringing about &quot;the fall of a tyrant&quot;.

===Shakespearean dramatisation===
William Shakespeare gives prominence to the Battle of Bosworth in his play, &quot;Richard III&quot;. It is the &quot;one big battle&quot;; no other fighting scene distracts the audience from this action, represented by a one-on-one sword fight between Henry Tudor and Richard III. Shakespeare uses their duel to bring a climactic end to the play and the Wars of the Roses; he also uses it to champion morality, portraying the &quot;unequivocal triumph of good over evil&quot;. Richard, the villainous lead character, has been built up in the battles of Shakespeare&#x27;s earlier play, &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;, as a &quot;formidable swordsman and a courageous military leader&quot;—in contrast to the dastardly means by which he becomes king in &quot;Richard III&quot;. Although the Battle of Bosworth has only five sentences to direct it, three scenes and more than four hundred lines precede the action, developing the background and motivations for the characters in anticipation of the battle.
Shakespeare&#x27;s account of the battle was mostly based on chroniclers Edward Hall&#x27;s and Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s dramatic versions of history, which were sourced from Vergil&#x27;s chronicle. However, Shakespeare&#x27;s attitude towards Richard was shaped by scholar Thomas More, whose writings displayed extreme bias against the Yorkist king. The result of these influences is a script that vilifies the king, and Shakespeare had few qualms about departing from history to incite drama. Margaret of Anjou died in 1482, but Shakespeare had her speak to Richard&#x27;s mother before the battle to foreshadow Richard&#x27;s fate and fulfill the prophecy she had given in &quot;Henry VI&quot;. Shakespeare exaggerated the cause of Richard&#x27;s restless night before the battle, imagining it as a haunting by the ghosts of those whom the king had murdered, including Buckingham. Richard is portrayed as suffering a pang of conscience, but as he speaks he regains his confidence and asserts that he will be evil, if such needed to retain his crown.

The fight between the two armies is simulated by rowdy noises made off-stage (&quot;alarums&quot; or alarms) while actors walk on-stage, deliver their lines, and exit. To build anticipation for the duel, Shakespeare requests more &quot;alarums&quot; after Richard&#x27;s councillor, William Catesby, announces that the king is &quot;[enacting] more wonders than a man&quot;. Richard punctuates his entrance with the classic line, &quot;A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse!&quot; He refuses to withdraw, continuing to seek to slay Henry&#x27;s doubles until he has killed his nemesis. There is no documentary evidence that Henry had five decoys at Bosworth Field; the idea was Shakespeare&#x27;s invention. He drew inspiration from Henry IV&#x27;s use of them at the Battle of Shrewsbury (1403) to amplify the perception of Richard&#x27;s courage on the battlefield. Similarly, the single combat between Henry and Richard is Shakespeare&#x27;s creation. &quot;The True Tragedy of Richard III&quot;, by an unknown playwright, earlier than Shakespeare&#x27;s, has no signs of staging such an encounter: its stage directions give no hint of visible combat.
Despite the dramatic licences taken, Shakespeare&#x27;s version of the Battle of Bosworth was the model of the event for English textbooks for many years during the 18th and 19th centuries. This glamorised version of history, promulgated in books and paintings and played out on stages across the country, perturbed humorist Gilbert Abbott à Beckett. He voiced his criticism in the form of a poem, equating the romantic view of the battle to watching a &quot;fifth-rate production of &quot;Richard III&quot;&quot;: shabbily costumed actors fight the Battle of Bosworth on-stage while those with lesser roles lounge at the back, showing no interest in the proceedings.

In Laurence Olivier&#x27;s 1955 film adaptation of &quot;Richard III&quot;, the Battle of Bosworth is represented not by a single duel but a general melee that became the film&#x27;s most recognised scene and a regular screening at Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre. The film depicts the clash between the Yorkist and Lancastrian armies on an open field, focusing on individual characters amidst the savagery of hand-to-hand fighting, and received accolades for the realism portrayed. One reviewer for &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; newspaper, however, was not impressed, finding the number of combatants too sparse for the wide plains and a lack of subtlety in Richard&#x27;s death scene. The means by which Richard is shown to prepare his army for the battle also earned acclaim. As Richard speaks to his men and draws his plans in the sand using his sword, his units appear on-screen, arraying themselves according to the lines that Richard had drawn. Intimately woven together, the combination of pictorial and narrative elements effectively turns Richard into a storyteller, who acts out the plot he has constructed. Shakespearian critic Herbert Coursen extends that imagery: Richard sets himself up as a creator of men, but dies amongst the savagery of his creations. Coursen finds the depiction a contrast to that of Henry V and his &quot;band of brothers&quot;.

The adaptation of the setting for &quot;Richard III&quot; to a 1930s fascist England in Ian McKellen&#x27;s 1995 film, however, did not sit well with historians. Adams posits that the original Shakespearian setting for Richard&#x27;s fate at Bosworth teaches the moral of facing one&#x27;s fate, no matter how unjust it is, &quot;nobly and with dignity&quot;. By overshadowing the dramatic teaching with special effects, McKellen&#x27;s film reduces its version of the battle to a pyrotechnic spectacle about the death of a one-dimensional villain. Coursen agrees that, in this version, the battle and Richard&#x27;s end are trite and underwhelming.

==Battlefield location==

The site of the battle is deemed by Leicestershire County Council to be in the vicinity of the town of Market Bosworth. The council engaged historian Daniel Williams to research the battle, and in 1974 his findings were used to build the Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre and the presentation it houses. Williams&#x27;s interpretation, however, has since been questioned. Sparked by the battle&#x27;s quincentenary celebration in 1985, a dispute among historians has led many to doubt the accuracy of Williams&#x27;s theory. In particular, geological surveys conducted from 2003 to 2009 by the Battlefields Trust, a charitable organisation that protects and studies old English battlefields, show that the southern and eastern flanks of Ambion Hill were solid ground in the 15th century, contrary to Williams&#x27;s claim that it was a large area of marshland. Landscape archaeologist Glenn Foard, leader of the survey, said the collected soil samples and finds of medieval military equipment suggest that the battle took place southwest of Ambion Hill (52°34′41″N 1°26′02″W), contrary to the popular belief that it was fought near the foot of the hill.

===Historians&#x27; theories===

English Heritage argues that the battle was named after Market Bosworth because the town was then the nearest significant settlement to the battlefield. As explored by Professor Philip Morgan, a battle might initially not be named specifically at all. As time passes, writers of administrative and historical records find it necessary to identify a notable battle, ascribing it a name that is usually toponymical in nature and sourced from combatants or observers. This name then becomes accepted by society and without question. Early records associated the Battle of Bosworth with &quot;Brownehethe&quot;, &quot;bellum Miravallenses&quot;, &quot;Sandeford&quot; and &quot;Dadlyngton field&quot;. The earliest record, a municipal memorandum of 23 August 1485 from York, locates the battle &quot;on the field of Redemore&quot;. This is corroborated by a 1485–86 letter that mentions &quot;Redesmore&quot; as its site. According to the historian, Peter Foss, records did not associate the battle with &quot;Bosworth&quot; until 1510.

Foss is named by English Heritage as the principal advocate for &quot;Redemore&quot; as the battle site. He suggests the name is derived from &quot;Hreod Mor&quot;, an Anglo-Saxon phrase that means &quot;reedy marshland&quot;. Basing his opinion on 13th- and 16th-century church records, he believes &quot;Redemore&quot; was an area of wetland that lay between Ambion Hill and the village of Dadlington, and was close to the Fenn Lanes, a Roman road running east to west across the region. Foard believes this road to be the most probable route that both armies took to reach the battlefield. Williams dismisses the notion of &quot;Redmore&quot; as a specific location, saying that the term refers to a large area of reddish soil; Foss argues that Williams&#x27;s sources are local stories and flawed interpretations of records. Moreover, he proposes that Williams was influenced by William Hutton&#x27;s 1788 &quot;The Battle of Bosworth-Field&quot;, which Foss blames for introducing the notion that the battle was fought west of Ambion Hill on the north side of the River Sence. Hutton, as Foss suggests, misinterpreted a passage from his source, Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s 1577 &quot;Chronicle&quot;. Holinshed wrote, &quot;King Richard pitched his field on a hill called Anne Beame, refreshed his soldiers and took his rest.&quot; Foss believes that Hutton mistook &quot;field&quot; to mean &quot;field of battle&quot;, thus creating the idea that the fight took place on Anne Beame (Ambion) Hill. To &quot;[pitch] his field&quot;, as Foss clarifies, was a period expression for setting up a camp.

Foss brings further evidence for his &quot;Redemore&quot; theory by quoting Edward Hall&#x27;s 1550 &quot;Chronicle&quot;. Hall stated that Richard&#x27;s army stepped onto a plain after breaking camp the next day. Furthermore, historian William Burton, author of &quot;Description of Leicestershire&quot; (1622), wrote that the battle was &quot;fought in a large, flat, plaine, and spacious ground, three miles [5 km] distant from [Bosworth], between the Towne of Shenton, Sutton [Cheney], Dadlington and Stoke [Golding]&quot;. In Foss&#x27;s opinion both sources are describing an area of flat ground north of Dadlington.

===Physical site===
English Heritage, responsible for managing England&#x27;s historic sites, used both theories to designate the site for Bosworth Field. Without preference for either theory, they constructed a single continuous battlefield boundary that encompasses the locations proposed by both Williams and Foss. The region has experienced extensive changes over the years, starting after the battle. Holinshed stated in his chronicle that he found firm ground where he expected the marsh to be, and Burton confirmed that by the end of the 16th century, areas of the battlefield were enclosed and had been improved to make them agriculturally productive. Trees were planted on the south side of Ambion Hill, forming Ambion Wood. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Ashby Canal carved through the land west and south-west of Ambion Hill. Winding alongside the canal at a distance, the Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway crossed the area on an embankment. The changes to the landscape were so extensive that when Hutton revisited the region in 1807 after an earlier 1788 visit, he could not readily find his way around.
Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre was built on Ambion Hill, near Richard&#x27;s Well. According to legend, Richard III drank from one of the several springs in the region on the day of the battle. In 1788, a local pointed out one of the springs to Hutton as the one mentioned in the legend. A stone structure was later built over the location. The inscription on the well reads:

Northwest of Ambion Hill, just across the northern tributary of the , a flag and memorial stone mark Richard&#x27;s Field. Erected in 1973, the site was selected on the basis of Williams&#x27;s theory. St James&#x27;s Church at Dadlington is the only structure in the area that is reliably associated with the Battle of Bosworth; the bodies of those killed in the battle were buried there.

===Rediscovered battlefield and possible battle scenario===
The very extensive survey carried out (2005–2009) by the Battlefields Trust headed by Glenn Foard led eventually to the discovery of the real location of the core battlefield. This lies about a kilometre further west of the location suggested by Peter Foss. It is in what was at the time of the battle an area of marginal land at the meeting of several township boundaries. There was a cluster of field names suggesting the presence of marshland and heath. Thirty four lead round shot were discovered as a result of systematic metal detecting (more than the total found previously on all other C15th European battlefields), as well as other significant finds, including a small silver gilt badge depicting a boar. Experts believe that the boar badge could indicate the actual site of Richard III&#x27;s death, since this high-status badge depicting his personal emblem was probably worn by a member of his close retinue.
A new interpretation of the battle now integrates the historic accounts with the battlefield finds and landscape history. The new site lies either side of the Fenn Lanes Roman road, close to Fenn Lane Farm and is some three kilometres to the southwest of Ambion Hill.

Based on the round shot scatter, the likely size of Richard III&#x27;s army, and the topography, Glenn Foard and Anne Curry think that Richard may have lined up his forces on a slight ridge which lies just east of Fox Covert Lane and behind a postulated medieval marsh. Richard&#x27;s vanguard commanded by the Duke of Norfolk was on the right (north) side of Richard&#x27;s battle line, with the Earl of Northumberland on Richard&#x27;s left (south) side.

Tudor&#x27;s forces approached along the line of the Roman road and lined up to the west of the present day Fenn Lane Farm, having marched from the vicinity of Merevale in Warwickshire.

Historic England have re-defined the boundaries of the registered Bosworth Battlefield to incorporate the newly identified site. There are hopes that public access to the site will be possible in the future.

<doc id="3794" wikidata="Q156888" url="?curid=3794" title="Brassicaceae">
<text>Brassicaceae () or (the older) Cruciferae () is a medium-sized and economically important family of flowering plants commonly known as the mustards, the crucifers, or the cabbage family. Most are herbaceous plants, while some are shrubs. The leaves are simple (although are sometimes deeply incised), lack stipules, and appear alternately on stems or in rosettes. The inflorescences are terminal and lack bracts. The flowers have four free sepals, four free alternating petals, two shorter free stamens and four longer free stamens. The fruit has seeds in rows, divided by a thin wall (or septum).

The family contains 372 genera and 4,060 accepted species. The largest genera are &quot;Draba&quot; (440 species), &quot;Erysimum&quot; (261 species), &quot;Lepidium&quot; (234 species), &quot;Cardamine&quot; (233 species), and &quot;Alyssum&quot; (207 species).

The family contains the cruciferous vegetables, including species such as &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot; (cultivated as cabbage, kale, cauliflower, broccoli and collards), &quot;Brassica rapa&quot; (turnip, Chinese cabbage, etc.), &quot;Brassica napus&quot; (rapeseed, etc.), &quot;Raphanus sativus&quot; (common radish), &quot;Armoracia rusticana&quot; (horseradish), but also a cut-flower &quot;Matthiola&quot; (stock) and the model organism &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; (thale cress).

&quot;Pieris rapae&quot; and other butterflies of the family Pieridae are some of the best-known pests of Brassicaceae species planted as commercial crops. &quot;Trichoplusia ni&quot; (cabbage looper) moth is also becoming increasingly problematic for crucifers due to its resistance to commonly used pest control methods. Some rarer &quot;Pieris&quot; butterflies, such as &quot;P. virginiensis&quot;, depend upon native mustards for their survival in their native habitats. Some non-native mustards such as &quot;Alliaria petiolata&quot; (garlic mustard), an extremely invasive species in the United States, can be toxic to their larvae.

== Description ==

Species belonging to the Brassicaceae are mostly annual, biennial, or perennial herbaceous plants, some are dwarf shrubs or shrubs, and very few vines. Although generally terrestrial, a few species such as water awlwort live submerged in fresh water. They may have a taproot or a sometimes woody caudex that may have few or many branches, some have thin or tuberous rhizomes, or rarely develop runners. Few species have multi-cellular glands. Hairs consist of one cell and occur in many forms: from simple to forked, star-, tree- or T-shaped, rarely taking the form of a shield or scale. They are never topped by a gland. The stems may be upright, rise up towards the tip, or lie flat, are mostly herbaceous but sometimes woody. Stems carry leaves or the stems may be leafless (in &quot;Caulanthus&quot;), and some species lack stems altogether. The leaves do not have stipules, but there may be a pair of glands at base of leaf stalks and flower stalks. The leaf may be seated or have a leafstalk. The leaf blade is usually simple, entire or dissected, rarely trifoliolate or pinnately compound. A leaf rosette at the base may be present or absent. The leaves along the stem are almost always alternately arranged, rarely apparently opposite. The stomata are of the anisocytic type. The genome size of Brassicaceae compared to that of other Angiosperm families is very small to small (less than 3.425 million base pairs per cell), varying from 150 Mbp in &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; and &quot;Sphaerocardamum&quot; spp., to 2375 Mbp &quot;Bunias orientalis&quot;. The number of homologous chromosome sets varies from four (n=4) in some &quot;Physaria&quot; and &quot;Stenopetalum&quot; species, five (n=5) in other &quot;Physaria&quot; and &quot;Stenopetalum&quot; species, &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; and a &quot;Mathiola&quot; species, to seventeen (n=17). About 35% of the species in which chromosomes have been counted have eight sets (n=8). Due to polyploidy, some species may have up to 256 individual chromosomes, with some very high counts in the North American species of &quot;Cardamine&quot;, such as &quot;C. diphylla&quot;. Hybridisation is not unusual in Brassicaceae, especially in &quot;Arabis&quot;, &quot;Rorippa&quot;, &quot;Cardamine&quot; and &quot;Boechera&quot;. Hybridisation between species originating in Africa and California, and subsequent polyploidisation is surmised for &quot;Lepidium&quot; species native to Australia and New Zealand.

=== Inflorescence and flower ===
Flowers may be arranged in racemes, panicles, or corymbs, with pedicels sometimes in the axil of a bract, and few species have flowers that sit individually on flower stems that spring from the axils of rosette leaves. The orientation of the pedicels when fruits are ripe varies dependent on the species. The flowers are bisexual, star symmetrical (zygomorphic in &quot;Iberis&quot; and &quot;Teesdalia&quot;) and the ovary positioned above the other floral parts. Each flower has four free or seldom merged sepals, the lateral two sometimes with a shallow spur, which are mostly shed after flowering, rarely persistent, may be reflexed, spreading, ascending, or erect, together forming a tube-, bell- or urn-shaped calyx. Each flower has four petals, set alternating with the sepals, although in some species these are rudimentary or absent. They may be differentiated into a blade and a claw or not, and consistently lack basal appendages. The blade is entire or has an indent at the tip, and may sometimes be much smaller than the claws. The mostly six stamens are set in two whorls: usually the two lateral, outer ones are shorter than the four inner stamens, but very rarely the stamens can all have the same length, and very rarely species have different numbers of stamens such as sixteen to twenty four in &quot;Megacarpaea&quot;, four in &quot;Cardamine hirsuta&quot;, and two in &quot;Coronopus&quot;. The filaments are slender and not fused, while the anthers consist of two pollen producing cavities, and open with longitudinal slits. The pollen grains are tricolpate. The receptacle carries a variable number of nectaries, but these are always present opposite the base of the lateral stamens.

=== Ovary, fruit and seed ===
There is one superior pistil that consists of two carpels that may either sit directly above the base of the stamens or on a stalk. It initially consists of only one cavity but during its further development a thin wall grows that divides the cavity, both placentas and separates the two valves (a so-called false septum). Rarely, there is only one cavity without a septum. The 2–600 ovules are usually along the side margin of the carpels, or rarely at the top. Fruits are capsules that open with two valves, usually towards the top. These are called silique if at least three times longer than wide, or silicle if the length is less than three times the width. The fruit is very variable in its other traits. There may be one persistent style that connects the ovary to the globular or conical stigma, which is undivided or has two spreading or connivent lobes. The variously shaped seeds are usually yellow or brown in color, and arranged in one or two rows in each cavity. The seed leaves are entire or have a notch at the tip. The seed does not contain endosperm.

=== Differences with similar families ===
Brassicaceae have a bisymmetrical corolla (left is mirrored by right, stem-side by out-side, but each quarter is not symmetrical), a septum dividing the fruit, lack stipules and have simple (although sometimes deeply incised) leaves. The sister family Cleomaceae has bilateral symmetrical corollas (left is mirrored by right, but stem-side is different from out-side), stipules and mostly palmately divided leaves, and mostly no septum. Capparaceae generally have a gynophore, sometimes an androgynophore, and a variable number of stamens.

=== Phytochemistry ===
Almost all Brassicaceae have C3 carbon fixation. The only exceptions are a few &quot;Moricandia&quot; species, which have a hybrid system between C3 and C4 carbon fixation, C4 fixation being more efficient in drought, high temperature and low nitrate availability. Brassicaceae contain different cocktails of dozens of glucosinolates. They also contain enzymes called myrosinases, that convert the glucosinolates into isothiocyanates, thiocyanates and nitriles, which are toxic to many organisms, and so help guard against herbivory.

==Taxonomy==
Carl Linnaeus in 1753 regarded the Brassicaceae as a natural group, naming them &quot;Klass&quot; Tetradynamia. Alfred Barton Rendle placed the family in the order Rhoeadales, while George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker in their system published from 1862 to 1883, assigned it to their cohort Parietales (now the class Violales). Following Bentham and Hooker, John Hutchinson in 1948 and again in 1964 thought the Brassicaceae to stem from near the Papaveraceae. In 1994, a group of scientists including Walter Stephen Judd suggested to include the Capparaceae in the Brassicaceae. Early DNA-analysis showed that the Capparaceae—as defined at that moment—were paraphyletic, and it was suggested to assign the genera closest to the Brassicaceae to the Cleomaceae. The Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae diverged approximately 41 million years ago. All three families have consistently been placed in one order (variably called Capparales or Brassicales). The APG II system merged Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae. Other classifications have continued to recognize the Capparaceae, but with a more restricted circumscription, either including &quot;Cleome&quot; and its relatives in the Brassicaceae or recognizing them in the segregate family Cleomaceae. The APG III system has recently adopted this last solution, but this may change as a consensus arises on this point. Current insights in the relationships of the Brassicaceae, based on a 2012 DNA-analysis, are summarized in the following tree.
=== Relationships within the family ===
Early classifications depended on morphological comparison only, but because of extensive convergent evolution, these do not provide a reliable phylogeny. Although a substantial effort was made through molecular phylogenetic studies, the relationships within the Brassicaceae have not always been well resolved yet. It has long been clear that the &quot;Aethionema&quot; are sister of the remainder of the family. One analysis from 2014 represented the relation between 39 tribes with the following tree.
=== Genera ===

As of October 2023 Plants of the World Online accepts 346 genera.

=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;Brassicaceae&quot; comes to international scientific vocabulary from Neo-Latin, from &quot;Brassica&quot;, the type genus, + &quot;&quot;, a standardized suffix for plant family names in modern taxonomy. The genus name comes from the Classical Latin word &quot;&quot;, referring to cabbage and other cruciferous vegetables. The alternative older name, , meaning &quot;cross-bearing&quot;, describes the four petals of mustard flowers, which resemble a cross. Cruciferae is one of eight plant family names, not derived from a genus name and without the suffix &quot;-aceae&quot; that are authorized alternative names.

== Distribution ==
Brassicaceae can be found almost on the entire land surface of the planet, but the family is absent from Antarctica, and also absent from some areas in the tropics i.e. northeastern Brazil, the Congo basin, Maritime Southeast Asia and tropical Australasia. The area of origin of the family is possibly the Irano-Turanian region, where approximately 900 species occur in 150 different genera. About 530 of those 900 species are endemics. Next in abundance comes the Mediterranean region, with around 630 species (290 of which are endemic) in 113 genera. The family is less prominent in the Saharo-Arabian region—65 genera, 180 species of which 62 are endemic—and North America (comprising the North American Atlantic region and the Rocky Mountain floristic region)—99 genera, 780 species of which 600 are endemic. South America has 40 genera containing 340 native species, Southern Africa 15 genera with over 100 species, and Australia and New-Zealand have 19 genera with 114 species between them.

== Ecology ==
Brassicaceae are almost exclusively pollinated by insects. A chemical mechanism in the pollen is active in many species to avoid selfing. Two notable exceptions are exclusive self-pollination in closed flowers in &quot;Cardamine chenopodifolia&quot;, and wind pollination in &quot;Pringlea antiscorbutica&quot;. Although it can be cross-pollinated, &quot;Alliaria petiolata&quot; (garlic mustard) is self-fertile. Most species reproduce sexually through seed, but &quot;Cardamine bulbifera&quot; produces gemmae and in others, such as &quot;Cardamine pentaphyllos&quot;, the coral-like roots easily break into segments, that will grow into separate plants. In some species, such as in the genus &quot;Cardamine&quot;, seed pods open with force and so catapult the seeds quite far. Many of these have sticky seed coats, assisting long-distance dispersal by animals, and this may also explain several intercontinental dispersal events in the genus, and its near global distribution. Brassicaceae are common on serpentine and dolomite rich in magnesium. Over a hundred species in the family accumulate heavy metals, particularly zinc and nickel, which is a record percentage. Several &quot;Alyssum&quot; species can accumulate nickel up to 0.3% of their dry weight, and may be useful in soil remediation or even bio-mining.

Brassicaceae contain glucosinolates as well as myrosinases inside their cells. When the cell is damaged, the myrosinases hydrolise the glucosinolates, leading to the synthesis of isothiocyanates, which are compounds toxic to most animals, fungi and bacteria. Some insect herbivores have developed counter adaptations such as rapid absorption of the glucosinates, quick alternative breakdown into non-toxic compounds and avoiding cell damage. In the whites family (Pieridae), one counter mechanism involves glucosinolate sulphatase, which changes the glucosinolate, so that it cannot be converted to isothiocyanate. A second is that the glucosinates are quickly broken down, forming nitriles. Differences between the mixtures of glucosinolates between species and even within species is large, and individual plants may produce in excess of fifty individual substances. The energy penalty for synthesising all these glucosinolates may be as high as 15% of the total needed to produce a leaf. &quot;Barbarea vulgaris&quot; (bittercress) also produces triterpenoid saponins. These adaptations and counter adaptations probably have led to extensive diversification in both the Brassicaceae and one of its major pests, the butterfly family Pieridae. A particular cocktail of volatile glucosinates triggers egg-laying in many species. Thus a particular crop can sometimes be protected by planting bittercress as a deadly bait, for the saponins kill the caterpillars, but the butterfly is still lured by the bittercress to lay its egg on the leaves.
A moth that feeds on a range of Brassicaceae is the diamondback moth (&quot;Plutella xylostella&quot;). Like the Pieridae, it is capable of converting isothiocyanates into less problematic nitriles. Managing this pest in crops became more complicated after resistance developed against a toxin produced by &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot;, which is used as a wide spectrum biological plant protection against caterpillars. Parasitoid wasps that feed on such insect herbivores are attracted to the chemical compounds released by the plants, and thus are able to locate their prey. The cabbage aphid (&quot;Brevicoryne brassicae&quot;) stores glucosinolates and synthesises its own myrosinases, which may deter its potential predators.

Since its introduction in the 19th century, &quot;Alliaria petiolata&quot; has been shown to be extremely successful as an invasive species in temperate North America due, in part, to its secretion of allelopathic chemicals. These inhibit the germination of most competing plants and kill beneficial soil fungi needed by many plants, such as many tree species, to successfully see their seedlings grow to maturity. The monoculture formation of an herb layer carpet by this plant has been shown to dramatically alter forests, making them wetter, having fewer and fewer trees, and having more vines such as poison ivy (&quot;Toxicodendron radicans&quot;). The overall herb layer biodiversity is also drastically reduced, particularly in terms of sedges and forbs. Research has found that removing 80% of the garlic mustard infestation plants did not lead to a particularly significant recovery of that diversity. Instead, it required around 100% removal. Given that not one of an estimated 76 species that prey on the plant has been approved for biological control in North America and the variety of mechanisms the plant has to ensure its dominance without them (e.g. high seed production, self-fertility, allelopathy, spring growth that occurs before nearly all native plants, roots that break easily when pulling attempts are made, a complete lack of palatability for herbivores at all life stages, etc.) it is unlikely that such a high level of control can be established and maintained on the whole. It is estimated that adequate control can be achieved with the introduction of two European weevils, including one that is monophagous. The USDA&#x27;s TAG group has blocked these introductions since 2004. In addition to being invasive, garlic mustard also is a threat to native North American &quot;Pieris&quot; butterflies such as &quot;P. oleracea&quot;, as they preferentially oviposit on it, although it is toxic to their larvae.

Invasive aggressive mustard species are known for being self-fertile, seeding very heavily with small seeds that have a lengthy lifespan coupled with a very high rate of viability and germination, and for being completely unpalatable to both herbivores and insects in areas to which they are not native. Garlic mustard is toxic to several rarer North American &quot;Pieris&quot; species.

This family includes important agricultural crops, among which many vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, Savoy, kohlrabi, and gai lan (&quot;Brassica oleracea&quot;), turnip, napa cabbage, mizuna, bok choy and rapini (&quot;Brassica rapa&quot;), rocket salad/arugula (&quot;Eruca sativa&quot;), garden cress (&quot;Lepidium sativum&quot;), watercress (&quot;Nasturtium officinale&quot;) and radish (&quot;Raphanus&quot;) and a few spices like horseradish (&quot;Armoracia rusticana&quot;), wasabi (&quot;Eutrema japonicum&quot;), white, Indian and black mustard (&quot;Sinapis alba&quot;, &quot;Brassica juncea&quot; and &quot;B. nigra&quot; respectively). Vegetable oil is produced from the seeds of several species such as &quot;Brassica napus&quot; (rapeseed oil), perhaps providing the largest volume of vegetable oils of any species. Woad (&quot;Isatis tinctoria&quot;) was used in the past to produce a blue textile dye (indigo), but has largely been replaced by the same substance from unrelated tropical species like &quot;Indigofera tinctoria&quot;.

&quot;Pringlea antiscorbutica&quot;, commonly known as Kerguelen cabbage, is edible, containing high levels of potassium. Its leaves contain a vitamin C-rich oil, a fact which, in the days of sailing ships, made it very attractive to sailors suffering from scurvy, hence the species name&#x27;s epithet &quot;antiscorbutica&quot;, which means &quot;against scurvy&quot; in Low Latin. It was essential to the diets of the whalers on Kerguelen when pork, beef, or seal meat was used up.

The Brassicaceae also includes ornamentals, such as species of &quot;Aethionema&quot;, &quot;Alyssum&quot;, &quot;Arabis&quot;, &quot;Aubrieta&quot;, &quot;Aurinia&quot;, &quot;Cheiranthus&quot;, &quot;Erysimum&quot;, &quot;Hesperis&quot;, &quot;Iberis&quot;, &quot;Lobularia&quot;, &quot;Lunaria&quot;, &quot;Malcolmia&quot;, and &quot;Matthiola&quot;. Honesty (&quot;Lunaria annua&quot;) is cultivated for the decorative value of the translucent remains of the fruits after drying. It can be a pest species in areas where it is not native.

The small Eurasian weed &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; is widely used as model organism in the study of the molecular biology of flowering plants (Angiospermae).

Some species are useful as food plants for Lepidoptera, such as certain wild mustard and cress species, such as &quot;Turritis glabra&quot; and &quot;Boechera laevigata&quot; that are utilized by several North American butterflies.

<text>Baseball statistics include a variety of metrics used to evaluate player and team performance in the sport of baseball. 

Because the flow of a baseball game has natural breaks to it, and player activity is characteristically distinguishable individually, the sport lends itself to easy record-keeping and compiling statistics. Baseball &quot;stats&quot; have been recorded since the game&#x27;s earliest beginnings as a distinct sport in the middle of the nineteenth century, and as such are extensively available through the historical records of leagues such as the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players and the Negro leagues, although the consistency, standards, and calculations are often incomplete or questionable. 

Since the National League (NL) was founded in 1876, statistics in the most elite levels of professional baseball have been kept at some level, with efforts to standardize the stats and their compilation improving during the early 20th century. Such efforts have evolved in tandem with advances in available technology ever since. The NL was joined by the American League (AL) in 1903; together the two constitute contemporary Major League Baseball.

New advances in both statistical analysis and technology made possible by the &quot;PC revolution&quot; of the 1980s and 1990s have driven teams and fans to evaluate players by an ever-increasing set of new statistics, which hold them to ever-evolving standards. With the advent of many of these methods, players can conditionally be compared across different time eras and run scoring environments.

==Development==
The practice of keeping records of player achievements was started in the 19th century by English-American sportswriter Henry Chadwick. Based on his experience with the sport of cricket, Chadwick devised the predecessors to modern-day statistics including batting average, runs scored, and runs allowed.

Traditionally, statistics such as batting average (the number of hits divided by the number of at bats) and earned run average (the average number of runs allowed by a pitcher per nine innings, less errors and other events out of the pitcher&#x27;s control) have dominated attention in the statistical world of baseball. However, the recent advent of sabermetrics has created statistics drawing from a greater breadth of player performance measures and playing field variables. Sabermetrics and comparative statistics attempt to provide an improved measure of a player&#x27;s performance and contributions to his team from year to year, frequently against a statistical performance average.

Comprehensive, historical baseball statistics were difficult for the average fan to access until 1951, when researcher Hy Turkin published &quot;The Complete Encyclopedia of Baseball&quot;. In 1969, Macmillan Publishing printed its first &quot;Baseball Encyclopedia&quot;, using a computer to compile statistics for the first time. Known as &quot;Big Mac&quot;, the encyclopedia became the standard baseball reference until 1988, when &quot;Total Baseball&quot; was released by Warner Books using more sophisticated technology. The publication of &quot;Total Baseball&quot; led to the discovery of several &quot;phantom ballplayers&quot;, such as Lou Proctor, who did not belong in official record books and were removed.

==Use==
Throughout modern baseball, a few core statistics have been traditionally referenced – batting average, RBI, and home runs. To this day, a player who leads the league in all of these three statistics earns the &quot;Triple Crown&quot;. For pitchers, wins, ERA, and strikeouts are the most often-cited statistics, and a pitcher leading his league in these statistics may also be referred to as a &quot;triple crown&quot; winner. General managers and baseball scouts have long used the major statistics, among other factors and opinions, to understand player value. Managers, catchers and pitchers use the statistics of batters of opposing teams to develop pitching strategies and set defensive positioning on the field. Managers and batters study opposing pitcher performance and motions in attempting to improve hitting. Scouts use stats when they are looking at a player who they may end up drafting or signing to a contract.

Some sabermetric statistics have entered the mainstream baseball world that measure a batter&#x27;s overall performance including on-base plus slugging, commonly referred to as OPS. OPS adds the hitter&#x27;s on-base percentage (number of times reached base by any means divided by total plate appearances) to their slugging percentage (total bases divided by at-bats). Some argue that the OPS formula is flawed and that more weight should be shifted towards OBP (on-base percentage). The statistic wOBA (weighted on-base average) attempts to correct for this.

OPS is also useful when determining a pitcher&#x27;s level of success. &quot;Opponent on-base plus slugging&quot; (OOPS) is becoming a popular tool to evaluate a pitcher&#x27;s actual performance. When analyzing a pitcher&#x27;s statistics, some useful categories include K/9IP (strikeouts per nine innings), K/BB (strikeouts per walk), HR/9 (home runs per nine innings), WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched), and OOPS (opponent on-base plus slugging).

However, since 2001, more emphasis has been placed on defense-independent pitching statistics, including defense-independent ERA (dERA), in an attempt to evaluate a pitcher&#x27;s performance regardless of the strength of the defensive players behind them.

All of the above statistics may be used in certain game situations. For example, a certain hitter&#x27;s ability to hit left-handed pitchers might incline a manager to increase their opportunities to face left-handed pitchers. Other hitters may have a history of success against a given pitcher (or vice versa), and the manager may use this information to create a favorable
match-up. This is often referred to as &quot;playing the percentages&quot;.

==Contemporary statistics==
The following listings include abbreviations and/or acronyms for both historic baseball statistics and those based on modern mathematical formulas known popularly as &quot;metrics&quot;.

The explanations below are for quick reference and do not fully or completely define the statistic; for the strict definition, see the linked article for each statistic.

===Batting statistics===
* 1B – Single: hits on which the batter reaches first base safely without the contribution of a fielding error
* 2B – Double: hits on which the batter reaches second base safely without the contribution of a fielding error
* 3B – Triple: hits on which the batter reaches third base safely without the contribution of a fielding error
* AB – At bat: plate appearances, not including bases on balls, being hit by pitch, sacrifices, interference, or obstruction
* AB/HR – At bats per home run: at bats divided by home runs
* BA – Batting average (also abbreviated &quot;AVG&quot;): hits divided by at bats (H/AB)
* BB – Base on balls (also called a &quot;walk&quot;): hitter not swinging at four pitches called out of the strike zone and awarded first base.
* BABIP – Batting average on balls in play: frequency at which a batter reaches a base after putting the ball in the field of play. Also a pitching category.
* BB/K – Walk-to-strikeout ratio: number of bases on balls divided by number of strikeouts
* BsR – Base runs: Another run estimator, like &quot;runs created&quot;
* EQA – Equivalent average: a player&#x27;s batting average absent park and league factors
* FC – Fielder&#x27;s choice: times reaching base safely because a fielder chose to try for an out on another runner
* GO/AO – Ground ball fly ball ratio: number of ground ball outs divided by number of fly ball outs
* GDP or GIDP – Ground into double play: number of ground balls hit that became double plays
* GPA – Gross production average: 1.8 times on-base percentage plus slugging percentage, divided by four
* GS – Grand slam: a home run with the bases loaded, resulting in four runs scoring, and four RBIs credited to the batter
* H – Hit: reaching base because of a batted, fair ball without error by the defense
* HBP – Hit by pitch: times touched by a pitch and awarded first base as a result
* HR – Home runs: hits on which the batter successfully touched all four bases, without the contribution of a fielding error
* HR/H – Home runs per hit: home runs divided by total hits
* ITPHR – Inside-the-park home run: hits on which the batter successfully touched all four bases, without the contribution of a fielding error or the ball going outside the ball park.

* BS – Blown save: number of times entering the game in a save situation, and being charged the run (earned or not) which eliminates his team&#x27;s lead
* CERA – Component ERA: an estimate of a pitcher&#x27;s ERA based upon the individual components of his statistical line (K, H, 2B, 3B, HR, BB, HBP)
* CG – Complete game: number of games where player was the only pitcher for their team
* DICE – Defense-Independent Component ERA: an estimate of a pitcher&#x27;s ERA based upon the defense-independent components of his statistical line (K, HR, BB, HBP) but which also uses number of outs (IP), which is not defense independent.
* ER – Earned run: number of runs that did not occur as a result of errors or passed balls
* ERA – Earned run average: total number of earned runs (see &quot;ER&quot; above), multiplied by 9, divided by innings pitched
* ERA+ – Adjusted ERA+: earned run average adjusted for the ballpark and the league average
* FIP – Fielding independent pitching: a metric, scaled to resemble an ERA, that focuses on events within the pitcher&#x27;s control – home runs, walks, and strikeouts – but also uses in its denominator the number of outs the team gets (see IP), which is not entirely within the pitcher&#x27;s control.
** xFIP: This variant substitutes a pitcher&#x27;s own home run percentage with the league average
* G – Games (AKA &quot;appearances&quot;): number of times a pitcher pitches in a season
* GF – Games finished: number of games pitched where player was the final pitcher for their team as a relief pitcher
* GIDP – Double plays induced: number of double play groundouts induced
* GIDPO – Double play opportunities: number of groundout induced double play opportunities

* H (or HA) – Hits allowed: total hits allowed
* H/9 (or HA/9) – Hits allowed per 9 innings pitched: hits allowed times nine divided by innings pitched (also known as H/9IP)
* HB – Hit batsman: times hit a batter with pitch, allowing runner to advance to first base
* HLD (or H) – Hold: number of games entered in a save situation, recorded at least one out, did not surrender the lead, and did not complete the game
* HR (or HRA) – Home runs allowed: total home runs allowed
* HR/9 (or HRA/9) – Home runs per nine innings: home runs allowed times nine divided by innings pitched (also known as HR/9IP)
* IBB – Intentional base on balls allowed
* IP – Innings pitched: the number of outs a team gets while a pitcher is pitching divided by 3
* IP/GS – Average number of innings pitched per game started
* IR – Inherited runners: number of runners on base when the pitcher enters the game
* IRA – Inherited runs allowed: number of inherited runners allowed to score
* K (or SO) – Strikeout: number of batters who received strike three
* K/9 (or SO/9) – Strikeouts per 9 innings pitched: strikeouts times nine divided by innings pitched
* K/BB (or SO/BB) – Strikeout-to-walk ratio: number of strikeouts divided by number of base on balls
* L – Loss: number of games where pitcher was pitching while the opposing team took the lead, never lost the lead, and went on to win
* LOB% – Left-on-base percentage: LOB% represents the percentage of baserunners a pitcher does not allow to score. LOB% tends to regress toward 70–72% over time, so unusually high or low percentages could indicate that pitcher&#x27;s ERA could be expected to rise or lower in the future. An occasional exception to this logic is a pitcher with a very high strikeout rate.
* OBA (or just AVG) – Opponents batting average: hits allowed divided by at-bats faced
* PC-ST – An individual pitcher&#x27;s total game pitches [Pitch Count] and [ST] his no. of strikes thrown within that PC.
* PIT (or NP) – Pitches thrown (Pitch count)
* PFR – Power finesse ratio: The sum of strikeouts and walks divided by innings pitched.
* pNERD – Pitcher&#x27;s NERD: expected aesthetic pleasure of watching an individual pitcher
* QOP – Quality of pitch: comprehensive pitch evaluation statistic which combines speed, location and movement (rise, total break, vertical break and horizontal break) into a single numeric value
* QS – Quality start: a game in which a starting pitcher completes at least six innings and permits no more than three earned runs
* RA – Run average: number of runs allowed times nine divided by innings pitched
* SHO – Shutout: number of complete games pitched with no runs allowed
*SIERA – Skill-Interactive Earned Run Average: another advanced stat that measures pitching. SIERA builds on FIP and xFIP by taking a deeper look at what makes pitchers better.
* SV – Save: number of games where the pitcher enters a game led by the pitcher&#x27;s team, finishes the game without surrendering the lead, is not the winning pitcher, and either (a) the lead was three runs or fewer when the pitcher entered the game; (b) the potential tying run was on base, at bat, or on deck; or (c) the pitcher pitched three or more innings
* SVO – Save opportunity: When a pitcher 1) enters the game with a lead of three or fewer runs and pitches at least one inning, 2) enters the game with the potential tying run on base, at bat, or on deck, or 3) pitches three or more innings with a lead and is credited with a save by the official scorer
* W – Win: number of games where pitcher was pitching while their team took the lead and went on to win, also the starter needs to pitch at least 5 innings of work (also related: winning percentage)
* W + S – Wins in relief + saves.
* whiff rate: a term, usually used in reference to pitchers, that divides the number of pitches swung at and missed by the total number of swings in a given sample. If a pitcher throws 100 pitches at which batters swing, and the batters fail to make contact on 26 of them, the pitcher&#x27;s whiff rate is 26%.
* WHIP – Walks and hits per inning pitched: average number of walks and hits allowed by the pitcher per inning
* WP – Wild pitches: charged when a pitch is too high, low, or wide of home plate for the catcher to field, thereby allowing one or more runners to advance or score

* E – Errors: number of times a fielder fails to make a play he should have made with common effort, and the offense benefits as a result
* FP – Fielding percentage: total plays (chances minus errors) divided by the number of total chances
* INN – Innings: number of innings that a player is at one certain position
* PB – Passed ball: charged to the catcher when the ball is dropped and one or more runners advance
* PO – Putout: number of times the fielder tags, forces, or appeals a runner and he is called out as a result
* RF – Range factor: 9*(putouts + assists)/innings played. Used to determine the amount of field that the player can cover
* TC – Total chances: assists plus putouts plus errors
* TP – Triple play: one for each triple play during which the fielder recorded a putout or an assist
* UZR – Ultimate zone rating: the ability of a player to defend an assigned &quot;zone&quot; of the field compared to an average defensive player at his position

===Overall player value===
* VORP – Value over replacement player: a statistic that calculates a player&#x27;s overall value in comparison to a &quot;replacement-level&quot; player. There are separate formulas for position players and pitchers
* Win shares: a complex metric that gauges a player&#x27;s overall contribution to his team&#x27;s wins
* WAR – Wins above replacement: a non-standard formula to calculate the number of wins a player contributes to his team over a &quot;replacement-level player&quot;
* PWA – Player Win Average: performance of players is shown by how much they increase or decrease their team&#x27;s chances of winning a specific game

* GB – Games behind: number of games a team is behind the division leader
* Pythagorean expectation: estimates a team&#x27;s expected winning percentage based on runs scored and runs allowed

==MLB statistical standards==
It is difficult to determine quantitatively what is considered to be a &quot;good&quot; value in a certain statistical category, and qualitative assessments may lead to arguments. Using full-season statistics available at the Official Site of Major League Baseball for the 2004 through 2015 seasons, the following tables show top ranges in various statistics, in alphabetical order. For each statistic, two values are given:
*Top5: the top five players bettered this value in all of the reported seasons
*Best: this is the best of all of the players for all of the reported seasons

<text>In baseball, an at bat (AB) or time at bat is a batter&#x27;s turn batting against a pitcher. An at bat is different from a plate appearance. A batter is credited with a plate appearance regardless of what happens upon completion of their turn at bat, but a batter is charged with an at bat only if that plate appearance does not have one of the results enumerated below. While at bats are used to calculate certain statistics, including batting average and slugging percentage, a player can qualify for the season-ending rankings in these categories only if they accumulate 502 plate appearances during the season.

Batters will not be charged an at bat if their plate appearances end under the following circumstances:
* Receiving a base on balls (BB).
* Being hit by a pitch (HBP).
* Hitting a sacrifice fly or a sacrifice bunt (also known as sacrifice hit).
* Being awarded first base due to catcher&#x27;s interference or fielder&#x27;s obstruction.
* Being replaced by another hitter before their at bat is completed, in which case the plate appearance and any related statistics go to the pinch hitter (unless they are replaced with two strikes and their replacement completes a strikeout, in which case the at bat and strikeout are charged to the first batter).
In addition, if the inning ends during at bat (due to the third out being made by a runner caught stealing, for example), no at bat or plate appearance will result because neither were completed.

An at bat is a specific type of plate appearance in which the batter stands at the plate intending to put the ball in play and get on base. This is why at bats, and not plate appearances, are used to calculate batting average, as plate appearances in general can result in many outcomes that do not necessarily involve putting the ball in play, and batting average specifically measures a batter&#x27;s contact hitting.

Rule 9.02(a)(1) of the official rules of Major League Baseball defines an at bat as: &quot;Number of times batted, except that no time at bat shall be charged when a player: (A) hits a sacrifice bunt or sacrifice fly; (B) is awarded first base on four called balls; (C) is hit by a pitched ball; or (D) is awarded first base because of interference or obstruction[.]&quot;

==Examples==
An at bat is counted when:
*The batter reaches first base on a hit
*The batter reaches first base on an error
*The batter strikes out or is called out for any reason other than a sacrifice
*There is a fielder&#x27;s choice

==Records==
Pete Rose had 14,053 career at bats, the all-time major league and National League record. The American League record is held by Carl Yastrzemski, whose 11,988 career at bats were all in the AL.

The single season record is held by Jimmy Rollins, who had 716 at bats in 2007. Willie Wilson, Ichiro Suzuki and Juan Samuel also had more than 700 at bats in a season. 14 players share the single game record of 11 at bats in a single game, all of which were extra inning games. In games of 9 innings or fewer, the record is 7 at bats and has occurred more than 200 times.

The team record for most at bats in a single season is 5,781 by the 1997 Boston Red Sox.

==At bat as a phrase==
&quot;At bat&quot;, &quot;up&quot;, &quot;up at bat&quot;, and &quot;at the plate&quot; are all phrases describing a batter who is facing the pitcher. Just because a player is described as being &quot;at bat&quot; in this sense, he will not necessarily be given an at bat in his statistics; the phrase actually signifies a plate appearance (assuming it is eventually completed). This ambiguous terminology is usually clarified by context. To refer explicitly to a statistical &quot;at bat&quot;, the term &quot;official at bat&quot; is sometimes used.

=== &quot;Time at bat&quot; in the rulebook ===
Official Baseball Rule 5.06(c) provides that &quot;[a] batter has legally completed his &quot;time at bat&quot; when he is put out or becomes a runner&quot; (emphasis added). The &quot;time at bat&quot; defined in this rule is more commonly referred to as a plate appearance, and the playing rules (Rules 1 through 8) uses the phrase &quot;time at bat&quot; in this sense. In contrast, the scoring rules use the phrase &quot;time at bat&quot; to refer to the statistic at bat, defined in Rule 9.02(a)(1), but sometimes uses the phrase &quot;official time at bat&quot; or refers back to Rule 9.02(a)(1) when mentioning the statistic. The phrase &quot;plate appearance&quot; is used in Rules 9.22 and 9.23 dealing with batting titles and hitting streaks, and in Rule 5.10(g) comment regarding the Three-Batter Minimum: &quot;[t]o qualify as one of three consecutive batters, the batter must complete his plate appearance, which ends only when the batter is put out or becomes a runner.&quot; The term is not elsewhere defined in the rulebook.

<doc id="3801" wikidata="Q906099" url="?curid=3801" title="Earned run">
<text>In baseball, an earned run is any run that was fully enabled by the offensive team&#x27;s production in the face of competent play from the defensive team. Conversely, an unearned run is a run that would not have been scored without the aid of an error or a passed ball committed by the defense; it is &quot;unearned&quot; in that it was, in a sense, &quot;given away&quot; by the defensive team.

Earned and unearned runs count equally toward the game score; the difference is purely statistical. Both total runs and earned runs are tabulated as part of a pitcher&#x27;s statistics, but earned runs are specially denoted because of their use in calculating a pitcher&#x27;s earned run average (ERA), the number of earned runs allowed by the pitcher per nine innings pitched (i.e., averaged over a regulation game). Thus, in effect, the pitcher is held personally accountable for earned runs, while the responsibility for unearned runs is shared with the rest of the team. 

To determine whether a run is earned, the official scorer must reconstruct the inning as it would have occurred without errors or passed balls.

==Details==
If no errors and no passed balls occur during the inning, all runs scored are automatically earned (assigned responsible to the pitcher(s) who allowed each runner to reach base). Also, in some cases, an error can be rendered harmless as the inning progresses. For example, a runner on first base advances to second on a passed ball and the next batter walks. Since the runner would now have been at second anyway, the passed ball no longer has any effect on the earned/unearned calculation. On the other hand, a batter/runner may make his entire circuit around the bases without the aid of an error, yet the run would be counted as unearned if an error prevented the third out from being made before he crossed the plate to score.

An error made by the pitcher in fielding at his position is counted the same as an error by any other player.

A run is counted as unearned when:

* A batter reaches base on an error (including catcher&#x27;s interference) that would have retired the batter except for the error, and later scores a run in that inning by any means.
* A batter hits a foul fly ball that is dropped by a fielder for an error, extending the at-bat, and later scores. In this case, the manner in which the batter reached base becomes irrelevant.
* A baserunner remains on base or advances to the next base as the result of an error on a fielder&#x27;s choice play that would put the baserunner out except for the error, and later scores.
* A batter reaches first base on a passed ball (but not a wild pitch) and later scores.
* A baserunner scores by any means after the third out would have been made except for an error other than catcher&#x27;s interference.
* A batter or runner advances one or more bases on an error or passed ball (but not a wild pitch) and scores on a play that would otherwise not have provided the opportunity to score.
* Under either form of a WBSC tiebreaker in which each half-inning starts with the last one or two batters from the previous inning being placed on either second base (and if two runners, first base) to begin the inning, a run scored by these runners are unearned. If the runners are erased on a fielder&#x27;s choice which places a batter on base, and the new batter-runner later scores, this would also be an unearned run. This rule was first implemented in WBSC competitions in 2008 and in the World Baseball Classic in 2013, with Major League Baseball adding it in 2020.

While the inning is still being played, the second and the second-last scenario can cause a temporary situation where a run has already scored, but its earned/unearned status is not yet certain. Under the last circumstance, for example, with two outs, a runner on third base scores on a passed ball. For the time being, the run is unearned since the runner &quot;should&quot; still be at third. If the batter strikes out to end the inning, it will stay that way. If the batter gets a base hit, which would have scored the runner anyway, the run now becomes earned.

Under the second circumstance, if there are runners on base and a batter hits a foul fly ball that is dropped, and then bats in the runners on base through a base hit (including a home run), the runs are unearned for the time being, as the runners should not have advanced. If the results of the remaining at-bats in the inning would not have scored the runners, the runs remain unearned. However, if results of subsequent at-bats would have scored the runs anyway, the runs would count as earned, unless they only would have scored as a result of a subsequent error or passed ball.

A baserunner who reaches on catcher&#x27;s interference and subsequently scores with two outs scores an unearned run, but baserunners who subsequently score after the runner who has reached on catcher&#x27;s interference exclusively on clean plays score earned runs; the baserunner cannot be assumed to have been put out except for the error. (2019 MLB Rule 9.16(a)(4)).

If a run is scored by a pinch-runner who replaces a baserunner who represents an unearned run, or by a pinch-hitter who continues the turn at bat of a batter who would be out except for an error, the run remains unearned, regardless of the substitution.

===Pitching changes===
When pitchers are changed in the middle of an inning, and one or more errors have already occurred, it is possible to have a run charged as earned against a specific pitcher, but unearned to the team. The simplest example is when the defensive team records two outs and makes an error on a play that would have been the third out. A new pitcher comes into the game, and the next batter hits a home run. The runner who reached on the error comes around to score, and his run is unearned to both the prior pitcher and the team. However, the run scored by the batter is counted as earned against the relief pitcher, but unearned to the team (since there should have already been three outs). Had the team not switched pitchers, neither run would be counted as an earned run because that pitcher should have already been out of that inning.

A pitcher who is relieved mid-inning may be charged with earned runs equal to the number of batters who reached base while he was pitching, even if the specific batters he faced do not score. The batters he put on base may be erased by fielder&#x27;s choice plays after he has been relieved by another pitcher, but if earned runs are scored in the inning the original pitcher is liable for as many earned runs as the number of batters he put on base. 
Example:
:On April 15, 2017, Detroit&#x27;s Justin Verlander allowed the first two Cleveland batters in the 5th inning to reach base on base hits; Verlander was then relieved by Shane Greene. Greene walked the next batter to load the bases. The next batter hit a grounder and Miguel Cabrera threw home to force out the runner on third in a fielder&#x27;s choice, so the bases remained loaded with one out. Greene struck out the next batter for the second out. Carlos Santana then hit a single that scored the runners from second and third (only one of whom was put on base by Verlander), and the runner from first was thrown out at the plate to end the inning. Since Verlander allowed two batters to reach base, he was charged with two earned runs, even though only one of the two specific batters he faced actually scored. 

When a pitching change occurs, the new pitcher is said to &quot;inherit&quot; any runners that are on base at the time, and if they later score, those runs are charged (earned or unearned) to the prior pitcher. Most box scores now list inherited runners, and the number that scored, as a statistic for the relief pitcher.

<text>A base on balls (BB), better known as a walk,
occurs in baseball when a batter receives four pitches during a plate appearance that the umpire calls &quot;balls&quot;, and is in turn awarded first base without the possibility of being called out. The base on balls is defined in Section 2.00 of baseball&#x27;s Official Rules, and further detail is given in 6.08(a). Despite being known as a &quot;walk&quot;, it is considered a faux pas for a professional player to actually walk to first base; the batter-runner and any advancing runners normally jog on such a play.

The term &quot;base on balls&quot; distinguishes a walk from the other manners in which a batter can be awarded first base without liability to be put out (e.g., hit by pitch (HBP), catcher&#x27;s interference). Though a base on balls, catcher&#x27;s interference, or a batter hit by a pitched ball all result in the batter (and possibly runners on base) being awarded a base, the term &quot;walk&quot; usually refers only to a base on balls, and not the other methods of reaching base without the bat touching the ball. An important difference is that for a hit batter or catcher&#x27;s interference, the ball is dead and no one may advance unless forced; the ball is live after a walk (see below for details).

A batter who draws a base on balls is commonly said to have been &quot;walked&quot; by the pitcher. When the batter is walked, runners advance one base without liability to be put out only if forced to vacate their base to allow the batter to take first base. If a batter draws a walk with the bases loaded, all preceding runners are forced to advance, including the runner on third base who is forced to home plate to score a run; when a run is forced on a walk, the batter is credited with a run batted in per rule 9.04.

Receiving a base on balls does not count as a hit or an at bat for a batter but does count as a time on base and a plate appearance. Therefore, a base on balls does not affect a player&#x27;s batting average, but it can increase his on-base percentage.

A hit by pitch is not counted statistically as a walk, though the effect is mostly the same, with the batter receiving a free pass to first base. One exception is that on hit-by-pitch, the ball is dead, and any runners attempting to steal on the play must return to their original base unless forced to the next base anyway. When a walk occurs, the ball is still live: any runner not forced to advance may nevertheless attempt to advance at his own risk, which might occur on a steal play, passed ball, or wild pitch. Also, because a ball is live when a base on balls occurs, runners on base forced to advance one base may attempt to advance beyond one base, at their own risk. The batter-runner himself may attempt to advance beyond first base, at his own risk. Rule 6.08 addresses this matter as well. An attempt to advance an additional base beyond the base awarded might occur when ball four is a passed ball or a wild pitch.

==History==
In early baseball, there was no concept of a &quot;ball&quot;. It was created by the NABBP in 1863, originally as a sort of unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty: &quot;Should the pitcher repeatedly fail to deliver to the striker fair balls, for the apparent purpose of delaying the game, or for any other cause, the umpire, after warning him, shall call one ball, and if the pitcher persists in such action, two and three balls; when three balls shall have been called, the striker shall be entitled to the first base; and should any base be occupied at that time, each player occupying them shall be entitled to one base without being put out.&quot; Note that this rule in effect gave the pitcher 9 balls, since each penalty ball could only be called on a third offense. In 1869 the rule was modified so that only those baserunners forced to advance could advance. From 1871 through 1886, the batter was entitled to call &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot;, i.e. above or below the waist; a pitch which failed to conform was &quot;unfair&quot;. Certain pitches were defined as automatic balls in 1872: any ball delivered over the batter&#x27;s head, that hit the ground in front of home plate, was delivered to the opposite side from the batter, or came within one foot of him. In 1880, the National League changed the rules so that eight &quot;unfair balls&quot; instead of nine were required for a walk. In 1884, the National League changed the rules so that six balls were required for a walk. In 1886, the American Association changed the rules so that six balls instead of seven were required for a walk; however, the National League changed the rules so that seven balls were required for a walk instead of six. In 1887, the National League and American Association agreed to abide by some uniform rule changes, including, for the first time, a strike zone which defined balls and strikes by rule rather than the umpire&#x27;s discretion, and decreased the number of balls required for a walk to five. In 1889, the National League and the American Association decreased the number of balls required for a walk to four. 

In 2017, Major League Baseball approved a rule change allowing for a batter to be walked intentionally by having the defending bench signal to the umpire. The move was met with some controversy.

==Intentional base on balls==
A subset of the base on balls, an intentional base on balls (IBB), or intentional walk, is when the defensive team intentionally issues a walk to the batter. In Major League Baseball and many amateur leagues, an intentional base on balls is signaled to the home plate umpire by the defensive team&#x27;s manager holding up four fingers, at which point the batter is awarded first base without any further pitches being thrown. In some leagues and in Major League Baseball prior to 2017, an intentional base on balls is issued when the pitcher deliberately pitches the ball away from the batter four times (or as many times as needed to get to ball four if the decision to issue the intentional walk is made with one or more balls already on the count). As with any other walk, an intentional walk entitles the batter to first base without liability to be put out, and entitles any runners to advance if forced. 

Intentional walks are a strategic defensive maneuver, commonly done to bypass one hitter for one the defensive team believes is less likely to initiate a run-scoring play (e.g., a home run, sacrifice fly, or RBI base hit). Teams also commonly use intentional walks to set up a double play or force out situation for the next batter.

===Single-season===


===Game===

Jimmie Foxx, Andre Thornton, Jeff Bagwell and Bryce Harper have each been walked six times during a major league regular season game. Among pitchers, Tommy Byrne and Bruno Haas both gave up 16 bases on balls in a game. On September 17, 1920, the Boston Red Sox drew 20 walks in a 12-inning game against the Detroit Tigers. , this is the most walks drawn or allowed by a team in a single game in Major League history according to available data.

<text>In baseball statistics, total bases (TB) is the number of bases a player has gained with hits. It is a weighted sum for which the weight value is 1 for a single, 2 for a double, 3 for a triple, and 4 for a home run. Only bases attained from hits count toward this total. Reaching base by other means (such as a base on balls) or advancing further after the hit (such as when a subsequent batter gets a hit) does not increase the player&#x27;s total bases.

The total bases divided by the number of at bats is the player&#x27;s slugging average.

Hank Aaron is the career leader in total bases with 6,856. Albert Pujols (6,211), Stan Musial (6,134), and Willie Mays (6,080) are the only other players with at least 6,000 career total bases.

As of September 26, 2024, no active players are in the top 100 for career total bases. The active leader is Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman, tied in 109th with 3,866.

<doc id="3806" wikidata="Q1326574" url="?curid=3806" title="Hit by pitch">
<text>In baseball, hit by pitch (HBP) is an event in which a batter or his clothing or equipment (other than his bat) is struck directly by a pitch from the pitcher; the batter is called a hit batsman (HB). A hit batsman is awarded first base, provided that (in the plate umpire&#x27;s judgment) he made an honest effort to avoid the pitch, although failure to do so is rarely called by an umpire. Being hit by a pitch is often caused by a batter standing too close to, or &quot;crowding&quot;, home plate. 

The rule dates from 1887; before that, a pitch that struck the batter was merely a ball.

==Official rule==
Per baseball official rule 5.05(b), a batter becomes a baserunner and is awarded first base when he or his equipment (except for his bat):
*is touched by a pitched ball outside the strike zone,
*&quot;and&quot; he attempts to avoid it (or had no opportunity to avoid it),
*&quot;and&quot; he did not swing at the pitch.
If all these conditions are met, the ball is dead, and other baserunners advance if they are forced to vacate their base by the batter taking first. Rule 5.09(a) further clarifies that a hit by pitch is also called when a pitch touches a batter&#x27;s clothing.

In the case where a batter swings and the pitch hits him anyway, the ball is dead and a strike is called. If the batter does not attempt to avoid the pitch, he is not awarded first base, and the pitch is ruled either a strike if in the strike zone or a ball if out of the strike zone. Umpires rarely make this call. A famous instance of a non-hit by pitch was on May 31, 1968, when Don Drysdale hit Dick Dietz with a pitch that would have forced in a run and ended Drysdale&#x27;s scoreless innings streak at 44. Umpire Harry Wendelstedt ruled that Dietz made no effort to avoid the pitch; Dietz proceeded to fly out, and Drysdale&#x27;s scoreless streak continued to a then-record 58 innings. Another notable example was the first game of the 2022 World Series. In the bottom of the 10th inning, Philadelphia Phillies pitcher David Robertson was pitching to Houston Astros pinch hitter Aldemys Diaz. With 2 balls and no strikes, two out and two runners in scoring position, Robertson threw a pitch inside that struck Diaz&#x27;s left arm. Home plate umpire James Hoye ruled that Diaz did not attempt to avoid the pitch and called the pitch a ball. Diaz, who had begun to take first base before Hoye called time, disputed the call, and would go on to ground out to end the game.

A hit-by-pitch can also be called on a pitch that has first touched the ground before hitting the batter. Such a bouncing pitch is like any other, and if a batter is hit by such a pitch, he will be awarded first unless he made no attempt to avoid it (and he had an opportunity to avoid it).

A batter hit by a pitch is not credited with a hit or at bat, but is credited with a time on base and a plate appearance; therefore, being hit by a pitch does not increase or decrease a player&#x27;s batting average but does increase his on-base percentage. A batter hit by a pitch with the bases loaded is also credited with an RBI per MLB rule 10.04(a)(2). A pitch ruled a hit by pitch is recorded as a ball in the pitcher&#x27;s pitch count, since by definition the ball must be outside the strike zone and not have been swung at.

The rule awarding first base to a batter hit by a pitch was instituted in 1887.

==Tactical use==

Inside pitching is a common and legal tactic in baseball, and many players make use of brushback pitches, or pitches aimed underneath the chin, commonly referred to as &quot;chin music&quot;, to keep players away from the plate. &quot;Headhunter&quot; is a common term for pitchers who have a reputation for throwing these kinds of pitches. However, throwing at a batter intentionally is illegal, and can be very dangerous. When an umpire suspects that a pitcher has thrown at a batter intentionally, but is not certain, a warning is issued to the pitcher and the managers of both teams. From that point on, any pitch thrown at a batter can cause the pitcher and the manager of the offending team to be ejected immediately from the game. Serious offenses such as a ball thrown at the head (called a beanball) can result in the immediate ejection of the pitcher, and the manager if he ordered the beanball, even without a warning. If the umpire is certain that the pitcher intentionally hit the batter with the pitch, the pitcher is ejected from the game with no warning. This infamously happened on August 15, 2018, when José Ureña was ejected from a game against the Atlanta Braves after hitting Ronald Acuña Jr. on the elbow with the first pitch of the game, which led to the Braves&#x27; and Marlins&#x27; benches emptying.

Occasionally, if a player is acting rude or unsportsmanlike, or having an extraordinarily good day, the pitcher may intentionally hit the batter, disguising it as a pitch that accidentally slipped his control. Managers may also order a pitcher to throw such a pitch (sometimes called a &quot;plunking&quot;). These pitches are typically aimed at the lower back and slower than normal, designed to send a message more than anything else. The opposing team usually hits a batter in retaliation for this act. The plunkings generally end there because of umpire warnings, but in some cases things can get out of hand, and sometimes they lead to the batter charging the mound, bench-clearing brawls, and several ejections.

==Records==

Korea Baseball Organization third baseman Choi Jeong holds the Korean Baseball Organization hit by pitch record with 348. It is also the world record. The all-time record for a player being hit by a pitch in MLB is held by Hughie Jennings, who was hit by 287 pitches between 1891 and 1903. The modern-era record is held by Craig Biggio of the Houston Astros, who had 285 as of the end of the 2007 season when he retired. Prior to Biggio, the modern-era record belonged to Don Baylor, who was hit 267 times.

The all-time single-season record also belongs to Jennings, who was hit 51 times during the 1896 season. Ron Hunt of the 1971 Montreal Expos was hit 50 times during that year, the modern-era record. The single-game record is three, held by numerous players.

The all-time record for pitchers is held by Gus Weyhing with 277 (1887–1901). The modern-era career pitching record for most hit batsmen is 205 by Hall-of-Famer Walter Johnson. The season record is 54 by Phil Knell in 1891, and the game record is six, held by Ed Knouff and John Grimes.
Brady Anderson was the first player to be hit by a pitch two times in the same inning in an American League game. On April 25, 2014, Brandon Moss became the second when he was hit twice in the top of the 9th inning by Houston Astros pitchers. Five players have been hit by a pitch twice in the same inning in the National League. On September 1, 2021, Austin Adams became the first pitcher hitting batters 20 or more times with 120 or less IPs in a season. Ed Doheny hit batters 22 times in 133.2 IP in 1900.

Three times has a perfect game been broken up by the 27th batter being hit by pitch. Hooks Wiltse, Max Scherzer, and Joe Musgrove hold this rare feat. All three finished with no-hitters after the hit by pitch. Scherzer&#x27;s team was leading 6–0 and Musgrove&#x27;s 3–0 when they pitched their no-hitters, but Wiltse&#x27;s team was scoreless through 9; he pitched a 10-inning 1–0 no-hitter. The record for most hit batters in a no-hitter is three, held by Chris Heston of the San Francisco Giants for his 2015 effort against the New York Mets.

Postseason career records are held by Greg Maddux and Tim Wakefield—each of whom hit 9 batters—and Shane Victorino, who was hit by pitch 11 times.

==Dangers==

One major-league player died as a result of being struck by a pitch: Ray Chapman of the Cleveland Indians was hit in the head by Carl Mays on August 16, 1920, and died the next morning.

Serious injuries may result from being hit by a pitch, even when wearing a batting helmet. On August 18, 1967, Boston Red Sox batter Tony Conigliaro was hit almost directly in the left eye by a fastball thrown by Jack Hamilton of the California Angels. His cheekbone was shattered; he nearly lost the sight of the eye, was unable to play for over a year, and never regained his earlier batting ability. At the time, batting helmets were not required to have an &quot;ear flap&quot;; it was not until 2002 that all major-league batters were required to wear helmets with side-protection. Ron Santo was the first player to wear a helmet with an improvised ear-flap; he had it made after he was struck by a pitch from Jack Fisher of the New York Mets on June 26, 1966, which briefly knocked Santo unconscious and left him with a fractured cheekbone.

Other notable injuries include: 
* Mickey Cochrane of the Detroit Tigers was hit in the head by a pitch from Bump Hadley of the New York Yankees on May 25, 1937. Cochrane nearly died from his injuries and never played again; he was inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1947.
* Kirby Puckett of the Minnesota Twins was struck in the cheek by a Dennis Martínez fastball on September 28, 1995, breaking his jaw and loosening two teeth. It was Puckett&#x27;s last regular-season game; during spring training the following year he developed glaucoma, which ended his career; he was inducted to the Hall of Fame in 2001.
* Mike Piazza, then with the Mets, was hit in the head by a pitch from Julián Tavárez of the St. Louis Cardinals on September 10, 2005. Piazza&#x27;s helmet shattered and he suffered a concussion; he went on to play in MLB through 2007 and was inducted to the Hall of Fame in 2016.

Other comparably minor injuries that are possible include broken fingers or hands, broken feet, broken ribs, injuries to the knee, or groin injuries.

==Legal interpretation==

Since inside pitching is a legitimate tactic in baseball, courts have recognized that being hit by a pitch is an inherent risk of the game, so that players cannot sue for any resulting injuries. On April 6, 2006, in a case arising from a game involving community college baseball teams, the Supreme Court of California ruled that baseball players in California assume the risk of being hit by baseballs &quot;even if&quot; the balls were intentionally thrown so as to cause injury. In the court&#x27;s words: &quot;For better or worse, being intentionally thrown at is a fundamental part and inherent risk of the sport of baseball. It is not the function of tort law to police such conduct.&quot;

<text>In baseball statistics, a hit (denoted by H), also called a base hit, is credited to a batter when the batter safely reaches or passes first base after hitting the ball into fair territory with neither the benefit of an error nor a fielder&#x27;s choice.

==Scoring a hit==
To achieve a hit, the batter must reach first base before any fielder can either tag him with the ball, throw to another player protecting the base before the batter reaches it, or tag first base while carrying the ball. The hit is scored the moment the batter reaches first base safely; if he is put out while attempting to stretch his hit to a double or triple or home run on the same play, he still gets credit for a hit (according to the last base he reached safely on the play).

If a batter reaches first base because of offensive interference by a preceding runner (including if a preceding runner is hit by a batted ball), he is also credited with a hit.

===Types of hits===
A hit for one base is called a single, for two bases a double, and for three bases a triple. A home run is also scored as a hit. Doubles, triples, and home runs are also called extra base hits.

An &quot;infield hit&quot; is a hit where the ball does not leave the infield. Infield hits are uncommon by nature, and most often earned by speedy runners.

==Pitching a no-hitter==

A no-hitter is a game in which one of the teams prevented the other from getting a hit. Throwing a no-hitter is rare and considered an extraordinary accomplishment for a pitcher or pitching staff. In most cases in the professional game, no-hitters are accomplished by a single pitcher who throws a complete game. A pitcher who throws a no-hitter could still allow runners to reach base safely, by way of walks, errors, hit batsmen, or batter reaching base due to interference or obstruction. If the pitcher allows no runners to reach base in any manner whatsoever (hit, walk, hit batsman, error, etc.), the no-hitter is a perfect game.

==1887 discrepancy==

In 1887, Major League Baseball counted bases on balls (walks) as hits. The result was skyrocketing batting averages, including some near .500; Tip O&#x27;Neill of the St. Louis Browns batted .485 that season, which would still be a major league record if recognized. The experiment was abandoned the following season.

There is controversy regarding how the records of 1887 should be interpreted. The number of legitimate walks and at-bats are known for all players that year, so computing averages using the same method as in other years is straightforward. In 1968, Major League Baseball formed a Special Baseball Records Committee to resolve this (and other) issues. The Committee ruled that walks in 1887 should not be counted as hits. In 2000, Major League Baseball reversed its decision, ruling that the statistics which were recognized in each year&#x27;s official records should stand, even in cases where they were later proven incorrect. Most current sources list O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s 1887 average as .435, as calculated by omitting his walks. He would retain his American Association batting championship. However, the variance between methods results in differing recognition for the 1887 National League batting champion. Cap Anson would be recognized, with his .421 average, if walks are included, but Sam Thompson would be the champion at .372 if they are not.

==Major League Baseball rules==
The official rulebook of Major League Baseball states in Rule 10.05:
::(a) The official scorer shall credit a batter with a base hit when:
:(1) the batter reaches first base (or any succeeding base) safely on a fair ball that settles on the ground, that touches a fence before being touched by a fielder or that clears a fence;
:(2) the batter reaches first base safely on a fair ball hit with such force, or so slowly, that any fielder attempting to make a play with the ball has no opportunity to do so;
::Rule 10.05(a)(2) Comment: The official scorer shall credit a hit if the fielder attempting to handle the ball cannot make a play, even if such fielder deflects the ball from or cuts off another fielder who could have put out a runner.
:(3) the batter reaches first base safely on a fair ball that takes an unnatural bounce so that a fielder cannot handle it with ordinary effort, or that touches the pitcher&#x27;s plate or any base (including home plate) before being touched by a fielder and bounces so that a fielder cannot handle the ball with ordinary effort;
:(4) the batter reaches first base safely on a fair ball that has not been touched by a fielder and that is in fair territory when the ball reaches the outfield, unless in the scorer&#x27;s judgment the ball could have been handled with ordinary effort;
:(5) a fair ball that has not been touched by a fielder touches a runner or an umpire, unless a runner is called out for having been touched by an Infield Fly, in which case the official scorer shall not score a hit; or
:(6) a fielder unsuccessfully attempts to put out a preceding runner and, in the official scorer&#x27;s judgment, the batter-runner would not have been put out at first base by ordinary effort.
Rule 10.05(a) Comment: In applying Rule 10.05(a), the official scorer shall always give the batter the benefit of the doubt. A safe course for the official scorer to follow is to score a hit when exceptionally good fielding of a ball fails to result in a putout.

::(b) The official scorer shall not credit a base hit when a:
:(1) runner is forced out by a batted ball, or would have been forced out except for a fielding error;
:(2) batter apparently hits safely and a runner who is forced to advance by reason of the batter becoming a runner fails to touch the first base to which such runner is advancing and is called out on appeal. The official scorer shall charge the batter with an at-bat but not a hit;
:(3) pitcher, the catcher or any infielder handles a batted ball and puts out a preceding runner who is attempting to advance one base or to return to his original base, or would have put out such runner with ordinary effort except for a fielding error. The official scorer shall charge the batter with an at-bat but not a hit;
:(4) fielder fails in an attempt to put out a preceding runner and, in the scorer&#x27;s judgment, the batter-runner could have been put out at first base; or
::Rule 10.05(b) Comment: Rule 10.05(b) shall not apply if the fielder merely looks toward or feints toward another base before attempting to make the putout at first base.
:(5) runner is called out for interference with a fielder attempting to field a batted ball, unless in the scorer&#x27;s judgment the batter-runner would have been safe had the interference not occurred.

<doc id="3808" wikidata="Q1154654" url="?curid=3808" title="On-base percentage">
<text>In baseball statistics, on-base percentage (OBP) measures how frequently a batter reaches base. An official Major League Baseball (MLB) statistic since 1984, it is sometimes referred to as on-base average (OBA), as it is rarely presented as a true percentage.

Generally defined as &quot;how frequently a batter reaches base per plate appearance&quot;, OBP is specifically calculated as the ratio of a batter&#x27;s times on base (the sum of hits, bases on balls, and times hit by pitch) to the sum of at bats, bases on balls, hit by pitch, and sacrifice flies. OBP does not credit the batter for reaching base on fielding errors, fielder&#x27;s choice, uncaught third strikes, fielder&#x27;s obstruction, or catcher&#x27;s interference, and deducts from plate appearances a batter intentionally giving himself up in a sacrifice bunt. 

OBP is added to slugging average (SLG) to determine on-base plus slugging (OPS). 

The OBP of all batters faced by one pitcher or team is referred to as &quot;on-base against&quot;.

On-base percentage is calculable for professional teams dating back to the first year of National Association of Professional Base Ball Players competition in 1871, because the component values of its formula have been recorded in box scores ever since. 

==History==
The statistic was invented in the late 1940s by Brooklyn Dodgers statistician Allan Roth with then-Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey. In 1954, Rickey, who was then the general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates, was featured in a Life Magazine graphic in which the formula for on-base percentage was shown as the first component of an all-encompassing &quot;offense&quot; equation. However, it was not named as on-base percentage, and there is little evidence that Roth&#x27;s statistic was taken seriously at the time by the baseball community at large.

On-base percentage became an official MLB statistic in 1984. Its perceived importance jumped after the influential 2003 book &quot;&quot; highlighted Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane&#x27;s focus on the statistic. Many baseball observers, particularly those influenced by the field of sabermetrics, now consider on-base percentage superior to the statistic traditionally used to measure offensive skill, batting average, which accounts for hits but ignores other ways a batter can reach base.

==Overview==
Traditionally, players with the best on-base percentages bat as leadoff hitter, unless they are power hitters, who traditionally bat slightly lower in the batting order. The league average for on-base percentage in Major League Baseball has varied considerably over time; at its peak in the late 1990s, it was around .340, whereas it was typically .300 during the dead-ball era. On-base percentage can also vary quite considerably from player to player. The highest career OBP of a batter with more than 3,000 plate appearances is .482 by Ted Williams. The lowest is by Bill Bergen, who had an OBP of .194.

On-base percentage is calculated using this formula:

:formula_1

where

*&quot;H&quot; = Hits
*&quot;BB&quot; = Bases on Balls (Walks)
*&quot;HBP&quot; = Hit By Pitch
*&quot;AB&quot; = At bat
*&quot;SF&quot; = Sacrifice fly

In certain unofficial calculations, the denominator is simplified and replaced by Plate Appearance (PA); however, the calculation PAs includes certain infrequent events that will slightly lower the calculated OBP (i.e. catcher&#x27;s interference, and sacrifice bunts). Sacrifice bunts are excluded from consideration on the basis that they are usually imposed by the manager with the expectation that the batter will not reach base, and thus do not accurately reflect the batter&#x27;s ability to reach base when attempting to do so. This is in contrast with the sacrifice fly, which is generally unintentional; the batter was trying for a hit.

<doc id="3809" wikidata="Q1133729" url="?curid=3809" title="Sacrifice fly">
<text>In baseball, a sacrifice fly (sometimes abbreviated to sac fly) is defined by Rule 9.08(d):
&quot;Score a sacrifice fly when, before two are out, the batter hits a ball in flight handled by an outfielder or an infielder running in the outfield in fair or foul territory that
# is caught, and a run scores after the catch, or
# is dropped, and a runner scores, if in the scorer&#x27;s judgment the runner could have scored after the catch had the fly ball been caught.&quot;

They are so named because the batter allows a teammate to score a run, while &quot;sacrificing&quot; their ability to do so. They are traditionally recorded in box scores with the designation &quot;SF&quot;.

== Rules ==

As addressed within Rule 9.02(a)(1) of the Official Baseball Rules a sacrifice fly is not counted as a time at bat for the batter, though the batter is credited with a run batted in. The same is true with a bases-loaded walk or hit by pitch.

The purpose of not counting a sacrifice fly as an at-bat is to avoid penalizing hitters for a successful action. The sacrifice fly is one of two instances in baseball where a batter is not charged with a time at bat after putting a ball in play; the other is the sacrifice hit (also known as a sacrifice bunt). But, while a sacrifice fly does not affect a player&#x27;s batting average, it counts as a plate appearance and lowers the on-base percentage. A player on a hitting streak will have it end with no official at-bats but a sacrifice fly.

Unlike a sacrifice bunt, which may be scored if a runner advances from any base to any base, a sacrifice fly is credited only if a runner scores on the play. Therefore, when a runner on first or second base tags on a fly ball and advances no further than third base, no sacrifice is given, and the batter is charged with an at-bat. Also, if a runner tags and advances from second base (or, theoretically, from first base) all the way to home and scores (without an intervening error), the batter is credited with a sacrifice fly, as well as with a second RBI if a runner on third also scores. At the professional level this will typically occur only in unusual circumstances that prevent the defense from making an immediate throw back to the infield, such as an outfielder colliding with the wall while making a catch on the warning track or a fly ball caught at the deepest part of the yard. It can also happen if two very fast baserunners occupy 2nd and 3rd base, such as when Willie McGee and Ozzie Smith scored on Tom Herr&#x27;s sacrifice fly in the 1982 World Series.

The sacrifice fly is credited even if another runner is put out, so long as the run scores. The sacrifice fly is credited on a dropped ball even if another runner is forced out by reason of the batter becoming a runner.

==Records==
The most sacrifice flies by a team in one game in Major League Baseball (MLB) is five; the record was established by the Seattle Mariners in 1988, tied by the Colorado Rockies in 2006, and tied again by the Mariners in 2008.

Five MLB teams have collected three sacrifice flies in an inning: the Chicago White Sox (fifth inning, July 1, 1962, against the Cleveland Indians); the New York Yankees twice (fourth inning, June 29, 2000, against the Detroit Tigers and third inning, August 19, 2000, against the Anaheim Angels); the New York Mets (second inning, June 24, 2005, against the Yankees); and the Houston Astros (seventh inning, June 26, 2005, against the Texas Rangers). In these cases one or more of the flies did not result in a putout due to an error.

Since the rule was reinstated in its present form in MLB in 1954, Gil Hodges of the Dodgers holds the record for most sacrifice flies in one season with 19, in 1954; Eddie Murray holds the MLB record for most sacrifice flies in a career with 128.

As of the end of the 2021 Major League Baseball season, the ten players who had hit the most sacrifice flies were as follows:

# Eddie Murray (128)
# Cal Ripken Jr. (127)
# Robin Yount (123)
# Hank Aaron (121)
# Frank Thomas (121)
# George Brett (120)
# Rubén Sierra (120)
# Rafael Palmeiro (119)
# Rusty Staub (119)
# Andre Dawson (118)

Only once has the World Series been won on a sac fly. In 1912, Larry Gardner of the Boston Red Sox hit a fly ball off a pitch from the New York Giants&#x27; Christy Mathewson. Steve Yerkes tagged up and scored from third base to win game 8 in the tenth inning and take the series for the Red Sox.

==History==
Batters have not been charged with a time at-bat for a sacrifice hit since 1893, but baseball has changed the sacrifice fly rule multiple times. The sacrifice fly as a statistical category was instituted in 1908, only to be discontinued in 1931. The rule was again adopted in 1939, only to be eliminated again in 1940, before being adopted for the last time in 1954. For some baseball fans, it is significant that the sacrifice-fly rule was eliminated in 1940 because, in 1941, Ted Williams was hitting .39955 on the last day of the season and needed one hit in a doubleheader against the Philadelphia A&#x27;s to become the first hitter since Bill Terry in 1930 to hit .400. He got six hits, finishing with an official .406 average, the last player in over 80 years to bat .400 or more in the American or National League. In his book &quot;Baseball and Other Matters in 1941&quot; author Robert Creamer, citing estimates, points out that if Williams&#x27; 14 at-bats on sacrifice flies that year were deducted from the 456 official at-bats he was charged with, his final average in 1941 would have been .419.

<doc id="3810" wikidata="Q7090832" url="?curid=3810" title="On-base plus slugging">
<text>On-base plus slugging (OPS) is a sabermetric baseball statistic calculated as the sum of a player&#x27;s on-base percentage and slugging percentage. The ability of a player both to get on base and to hit for power, two important offensive skills, are represented. An OPS of .800 or higher in Major League Baseball puts the player in the upper echelon of hitters. Typically, the league leader in OPS will score near, and sometimes above, the 1.000 mark.

==Equation==
The basic equation is

formula_1
where OBP is on-base percentage and SLG is slugging average. These averages are defined below as:

formula_2

- the numerator &quot;H + BB + HBP&quot; effectively means &quot;number of trips to first base at least&quot;

- the denominator &quot;AB + BB + SF + HBP&quot; effectively means &quot;total plate appearances&quot;, but does not include sacrifice bunts

This is because though a batter makes a trip to the plate he is not given an &quot;AB&quot; when he walks (BB or HBP) or when he hits the ball into play and is called out, but the action allows a run to score (SF). As a result, the 4 counts (AB + BB + SF +HBP) are needed to calculate a batter&#x27;s total trips to the plate.

and

formula_3

where:
*&quot;H&quot; = hits
*&quot;BB&quot; = bases on balls
*&quot;HBP&quot; = times hit by pitch
*&quot;AB&quot; = at bats
*&quot;SF&quot; = sacrifice flies
*&quot;TB&quot; = total bases

In one equation, OPS can be represented as:

formula_4

==History==
On-base plus slugging was first popularized in 1984 by John Thorn and Pete Palmer&#x27;s book, &quot;The Hidden Game of Baseball&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; then began carrying the leaders in this statistic in its weekly &quot;By the Numbers&quot; box, a feature that continued for four years. Baseball journalist Peter Gammons used and evangelized the statistic, and other writers and broadcasters picked it up. The popularity of OPS gradually spread, and by 2004 it began appearing on Topps baseball cards.

OPS was formerly sometimes known as &quot;production&quot;. For instance, &quot;production&quot; was included in early versions of Thorn&#x27;s &quot;Total Baseball&quot; encyclopedia, and in the &quot;Strat-O-Matic Computer Baseball&quot; game. This term has fallen out of use.

OPS gained popularity because of the availability of its components, OBP and SLG, and that team OPS correlates well with team runs scored.

==An OPS scale==
Bill James, in his essay titled &quot;The 96 Families of Hitters&quot; uses seven different categories for classification by OPS:

This effectively transforms OPS into a seven-point ordinal scale. Substituting quality labels such as &quot;excellent&quot; (A), &quot;very good&quot; (B), &quot;good&quot; (C), &quot;average&quot; (D), &quot;fair&quot; (E), &quot;poor&quot; (F) and &quot;very poor&quot; (G) for the A–G categories creates a subjective reference for OPS values.

==Leaders==

The top ten Major League Baseball players in lifetime OPS, with at least 3,000 plate appearances , were:

#Babe Ruth, 1.1636
#Ted Williams, 1.1155
#Lou Gehrig, 1.0798
#Oscar Charleston, 1.0632
#Barry Bonds, 1.0512
#Jimmie Foxx, 1.0376
#Turkey Stearnes, 1.0340
#Mule Suttles, 1.0276
#Hank Greenberg, 1.0169
#Rogers Hornsby, 1.0103

The top five were all left-handed batters. Jimmie Foxx has the highest career OPS for a right-handed batter.

The top ten single-season performances in MLB are (all left-handed hitters):

#Barry Bonds, 1.4217 ()
#Barry Bonds, 1.3807 ()
#Babe Ruth, 1.3791 ()
#Barry Bonds, 1.3785 ()
#Babe Ruth, 1.3586 ()
#Babe Ruth, 1.3089 ()
#Ted Williams, 1.2875 ()
#Barry Bonds, 1.2778 ()
#Babe Ruth, 1.2582 ()
#Ted Williams, 1.2566 ()

The highest single-season mark for a right-handed hitter was 1.2449 by Rogers Hornsby in , 13th on the all-time list. Since 1935, the highest single-season OPS for a right-hander is 1.2224 by Mark McGwire in , which was 16th all-time.

==Adjusted OPS (OPS+)==
OPS+, adjusted OPS, is a closely related statistic. OPS+ is OPS adjusted for the park and the league in which the player played. An OPS+ of 100 is defined to be the league average. An OPS+ of 150 or more is excellent and 125 very good, while an OPS+ of 75 or below is poor.

The basic equation for OPS+ is

formula_5

where *lgOBP is the park-adjusted OBP of the league and *lgSLG is the park-adjusted SLG of the league.

A common misconception is that OPS+ closely matches the ratio of a player&#x27;s OPS to that of their league. In fact, due to the additive nature of the two components in OPS+, a player with an OBP and SLG both 50% better than the league average in those metrics will have an OPS+ of 200 (twice the league average OPS+) while still having an OPS that is only 50% better than the average OPS of the league. It would be a better (although not exact) approximation to say that a player with an OPS+ of 150 produces 50% more &quot;runs&quot;, in a given set of plate appearances than a player with an OPS+ of 100 (though see clarification above, under &quot;History&quot;).

===Leaders in OPS+===
Through the end of the 2019 season, the career top twenty leaders in OPS+ (minimum 3,000 plate appearances) were:
#Babe Ruth, 206
#Ted Williams, 190
#Barry Bonds, 182
#Lou Gehrig, 179
#Mike Trout, 176
#Rogers Hornsby, 175
#Mickey Mantle, 172
#Dan Brouthers, 171
#Joe Jackson, 170
#Ty Cobb, 168
#Pete Browning, 163
#&lt;li value=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Jimmie Foxx, 163
#&lt;li value=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Mark McGwire, 163
#&lt;li value=&quot;14&quot;&gt;Dave Orr, 162
#&lt;li value=&quot;15&quot;&gt;Stan Musial, 159
#Hank Greenberg, 158
#&lt;li value=&quot;16&quot;&gt;Johnny Mize, 158
#&lt;li value=&quot;18&quot;&gt;Tris Speaker, 157
#&lt;li value=&quot;19&quot;&gt;Dick Allen, 156
#&lt;li value=&quot;19&quot;&gt;Willie Mays, 156
#&lt;li value=&quot;19&quot;&gt;Frank Thomas 156
The only purely right-handed batters to appear on this list are Browning, Hornsby, Foxx, Orr, Trout, McGwire, Allen, Mays, and Thomas. Mantle is the only switch-hitter in the group.

The highest single-season performances were:

#Barry Bonds, 268 ()
#Barry Bonds, 263 ()
#Barry Bonds, 259 ()
#Fred Dunlap, 258 (1884) *
#Babe Ruth, 256 ()
#Babe Ruth, 239 ()
#Babe Ruth, 239 ()
#Ted Williams, 235 ()
#Ted Williams, 233 ()
#Ross Barnes, 231 (1876) **
#Barry Bonds, 231 ()

* - Fred Dunlap&#x27;s historic 1884 season came in the Union Association, which some baseball experts consider not to be a true major league.

** - Ross Barnes may have been aided by a rule that made a bunt fair if it first rolled in fair territory. He did not play nearly so well when this rule was removed, although injuries may have been mostly to blame, as his fielding statistics similarly declined.

If Dunlap&#x27;s and Barnes&#x27;s seasons were to be eliminated from the list, two other Ruth seasons (1926 and 1927) would be on the list. This would also eliminate the only two right-handed batters in the list.

==Criticism==
Despite its simple calculation, OPS is a controversial measurement. OPS weighs on-base percentage and slugging percentage equally. However, on-base percentage correlates better with scoring runs. Statistics such as wOBA build on this distinction using linear weights. Additionally, the components of OPS are not typically equal (league-average slugging percentages are usually 75–100 points higher than league-average on-base percentages). As a point of reference, the OPS for all of Major League Baseball in 2019 was .758.

<text>In baseball, a stolen base occurs when a runner advances to a base unaided by other actions and the official scorer rules that the advance should be credited to the action of the runner. The umpires determine whether the runner is safe or out at the next base, but the official scorer rules on the question of credit or blame for the advance under Rule 10 (Rules of Scoring) of the MLB&#x27;s Official Rules.

A stolen base most often occurs when a base runner advances to the next base while the pitcher is pitching the ball to home plate.

Successful base stealers must be fast and have good timing.

==Background==
Ned Cuthbert, playing for the Philadelphia Keystones in either 1863 or 1865, was the first player to steal a base in a baseball game, although the term &quot;stolen base&quot; was not used until 1870. For a time in the 19th century, stolen bases were credited when a baserunner reached an extra base on a base hit from another player. For example, if a runner on first base reached third base on a single, it counted as a steal. In 1887, Hugh Nicol set a still-standing Major League record with 138 stolen bases, many of which would not have counted under modern rules. Modern steal rules were fully implemented in 1898.
Base stealing was popular in the game&#x27;s early decades, with speedsters such as Ty Cobb and Clyde Milan stealing nearly 100 bases in a season. But the tactic fell into relative disuse after Babe Ruth introduced the era of the home run – in 1955, for example, no one in baseball stole more than 25 bases, and Dom DiMaggio won the AL stolen base title in 1950 with just 15. However, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, base-stealing was brought back to prominence primarily by Luis Aparicio and Maury Wills, who broke Cobb&#x27;s modern single-season record by stealing 104 bases in 1962. Wills’ record was broken in turn by Lou Brock in 1974 and Rickey Henderson in 1982. The stolen base remained a popular tactic through the 1980s, perhaps best exemplified by Vince Coleman and the St. Louis Cardinals, but began to decline again in the 1990s as the frequency of home runs reached record heights and the steal-friendly artificial turf ballparks began to disappear.

Base stealing is an important characteristic of the &quot;small ball&quot; managing style (or &quot;manufacturing runs&quot;). Such managers emphasize &quot;doing the little things&quot; (including risky running plays like base-stealing) to advance runners and score runs, often relying on pitching and defense to keep games close. The Los Angeles Dodgers of the 1960s, led by pitcher Sandy Koufax and speedy shortstop Maury Wills, were a successful example of this style. The antithesis of this is reliance on power hitting, exemplified by the Baltimore Orioles of the 1970s, which aspired to score most of its runs via home runs. Often the &quot;small ball&quot; model is associated with the National League, while power hitting is associated with the American League. However, some successful recent American League teams, including the 2002 Anaheim Angels, the 2001 Seattle Mariners, the 2005 Chicago White Sox, and the 2015 Kansas City Royals, have excelled at &quot;small ball.&quot; The Royals in particular embodied this style within the last decade, leading the league in stolen bases but finishing last in home runs in 2013 and 2014, leading to a berth in two consecutive World Series, one of which they won. Successful teams often combine both styles, with speedy runners complementing power hitters—such as the 2005 White Sox, who hit 200 home runs, which was fifth most in the majors, and had 137 stolen bases, which was fourth.

==Base-stealing technique==
Baseball&#x27;s Rule 8 (The Pitcher) specifies the pitching procedure in detail. For example, in the Set Position, the pitcher must &quot;com[e] to a complete stop&quot;; thereafter, &quot;any natural motion associated with his delivery of the ball to the batter commits him to the pitch without alteration or interruption.&quot; A runner intending to &quot;steal on the pitcher&quot; breaks for the next base the moment the pitcher commits to pitch to home plate. The pitcher cannot abort the pitch and try to put the runner out; this is a balk under Rule 8.

If the runner breaks too soon (before the pitcher is obliged to complete a pitch), the pitcher may throw to a base rather than pitch, and the runner is usually &quot;picked off&quot; by being tagged out between the bases. Past this moment, any delay in the runner&#x27;s break makes it more likely that the catcher, after receiving the pitch, will be able to throw the runner out at the destination base.

Before the pitch, the runner takes a &quot;lead&quot;, walking several steps away from the base as a head start toward the next base. Even a runner who does not intend to steal takes a &quot;secondary lead&quot; of a few more steps, once the pitcher has legally committed to complete the pitch.

The pitcher may throw to the runner&#x27;s base. The runner must return to that base or risk being tagged out. As well as putting the runner out, an underlying goal is to dissuade the runner from too big a lead; that is, to &quot;hold the runner on&quot; the original base. (Historically, this gambit could be used without limit. An MLB rules change in 2023 limited the pitcher to two throws; the pitcher must then pitch to the batter.)

The more adept base stealers are proficient at &quot;reading the pickoff&quot;, meaning that they can detect certain &quot;tells&quot; (tell-tale signs) in a pitcher&#x27;s pre-pitch movements or mannerisms that indicate the pickoff attempt is or is not imminent. For example, one experienced base stealer noted that careless pitchers dig the toes on their back foot into the ground when they are about to pitch in order to get a better push off, but when they intend to turn and throw a pickoff, they do not.

If a batted ball is caught on the fly, the runner must return to his original base. In this case, a runner trying to steal is more likely to be caught off his original base, resulting in a double play. This is a minor risk of a steal attempt. It is offset by the fact that a ground ball double play is less likely.

==Plays involving baserunning==
In the &quot;hit-and-run play&quot;, coaches coordinate the actions of runner and batter. The runner tries to steal and the batter swings at almost any pitch, if only to distract the catcher. If the batter makes contact, the runner has a greater chance of reaching the next base; if the batter gets a base hit, the runner will likely be able to take an extra base. If the batter fails to hit the ball, the hit-and-run becomes a pure steal attempt.

The less common cousin to the hit and run is the &quot;run and hit&quot; play. In the run and hit, the base runner attempts to advance when the pitcher commits the pitch to home plate, but the batter is instead directed to exercise his judgement as to whether or not to swing at the pitch. If the batter feels it is not advantageous to swing, AND he believes the base runner is very likely to succeed in the steal attempt, he does not swing. This play is typically utilized with elite base stealers and skilled batters only, wherein a highly experienced batsman is trusted to decide whether or not to &quot;protect&quot; the base runner. If the batter chooses not to swing, it becomes a pure steal attempt.

In the &quot;delayed steal&quot;, the runner does not take advantage of the pitcher&#x27;s duty to complete a pitch, but relies on surprise and takes advantage of any complacency by the fielders. The runner gives the impression he is not trying to steal, and does not break for the next base until the ball crosses the plate. It is rare for Major League defenses to be fooled, but the play is used effectively at the college level. The first delayed steal on record was performed by Miller Huggins in 1903. The delayed steal was famously practiced by Eddie Stanky of the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Second base is the base most often stolen, because once a runner is on second base he is considered to be in &quot;scoring position&quot;, meaning that he is expected to be able to run home and score on most routine singles hit into the outfield. Second base is also the easiest to steal, as it is farthest from home plate and thus a longer throw from the catcher is required to prevent it. Third base is a shorter throw for the catcher, but the runner is able to take a longer lead off second base and can leave for third base earlier against a left-handed pitcher. A steal of home plate is the riskiest, as the catcher only needs to tag out the runner after receiving the ball from the pitcher. It is difficult for the runner to cover the distance between the bases before the ball arrives home. Ty Cobb holds the records for most steals of home in a single season (8) as well as for a career (54). Steals of home are not officially recorded statistics, and must be researched through individual game accounts. Thus Cobb&#x27;s totals may be even greater than is recorded. Jackie Robinson famously stole home in Game 1 of the 1955 World Series. Thirty-five games have ended with a runner stealing home, but only two have occurred since 1980. In a variation on the steal of home, the batter is signaled to simultaneously execute a sacrifice bunt, which results in the &quot;squeeze play.&quot; The &quot;suicide squeeze&quot; is a squeeze in which the runner on third begins to steal home without seeing the outcome of the bunt; it is so named because if the batter fails to bunt, the runner will surely be out. In contrast, when the runner on third does not commit until seeing that the ball is bunted advantageously, it is called a &quot;safety squeeze.&quot;

In more recent years, most steals of home involve a &quot;delayed double steal&quot;, in which a runner on first attempts to steal second, while the runner on third breaks for home as soon as the catcher throws to second base. If it is important to prevent the run from scoring, the catcher may hold on to the ball (conceding the steal of second) or may throw to the pitcher; this may deceive the runner at third and the pitcher may throw back to the catcher for the out.

==Statistics==

In baseball statistics, stolen bases are denoted by &quot;SB&quot;. Attempts to steal that result in the baserunner being out are &quot;caught stealing&quot; (&quot;CS&quot;). The sum of these statistics is &quot;steal attempts.&quot; Successful steals as a percentage of total steal attempts is called the &quot;success rate&quot;.

The rule on stolen bases states that:
*Advances that are credited to some other play are not steal attempts. For example, on a wild pitch or a passed ball, the official scorer must notice whether the runner broke for the next base before the pitch got away.
*As usual, statistics in the case of a defensive error are based on error-free play. If a runner would have been out, but for the error, it is scored as &quot;caught stealing, safe on the error.&quot; A catcher does not commit an error by throwing poorly to the destination base, but if any runner takes an extra base on the bad throw, it is &quot;stolen base plus error.&quot;
*There is no steal attempt on a dead ball, whether the runner is sent back to the original base (as on a foul ball) or is awarded the next base (as on a hit batsman). On a base award when the ball is live (such as a walk), the runner could make a steal attempt beyond the base awarded.
* Cases where the defense intentionally allows the runner to advance without attempting to put him out are scored as &quot;defensive indifference&quot;, also called &quot;fielder&#x27;s indifference&quot;, and do not count as stolen bases. This is usually only scored late in games when it is clear that the defense&#x27;s priority is getting the batter out. The lack of a putout attempt does not by itself indicate defensive indifference; the official scorer must also factor in the game situation and the defensive players&#x27; actions.

Relative skill at stealing bases can be judged by evaluating either a player&#x27;s total number of steals or the success rate. Noted statistician Bill James has argued that unless a player has a high success rate (67–70% or better), attempting to steal a base is detrimental to a team.

Comparing skill against players from other eras is problematic, because the definition has not been constant. Caught stealing was not recorded regularly until the middle of the 20th century. Ty Cobb, for example, was known as a great base-stealer, with 892 steals and a success rate of over 83%. However, the data on Cobb&#x27;s caught stealing is missing from 12 seasons, strongly suggesting he was unsuccessful many more times than his stats indicate. Carlos Beltrán, with 286 steals, has the highest career success rate of all players with over 300 stolen base attempts, at 88.3%.

==Evolution of rules and scoring==
The first mention of the stolen base as a statistic was in the 1877 scoring rules adopted by the National League, which noted credit toward a player&#x27;s total bases when a base is stolen. It was not until 1886 that the stolen base appeared as something to be tracked, but was only to &quot;appear in the summary of the game&quot;.

In 1887, the stolen base was given its own individual statistical column in the box score, and was defined for purposes of scoring: &quot;... every base made after first base has been reached by a base runner, except for those made by reason of or with the aid of a battery error (wild pitch or passed ball), or by batting, balks or by being forced off. In short, shall include all bases made by a clean steal, or through a wild throw or muff of the ball by a fielder who is directly trying to put the base runner out while attempting to steal.&quot; The next year, it was clarified that any attempt to steal must be credited to the runner, and that fielders committing errors during this play must also be charged with an error. This rule also clarified that advancement of another base(s) beyond the one being stolen is not credited as a stolen base on the same play, and that an error is charged to the fielder who permitted the extra advancement. There was clarification that a runner is credited with a steal if the attempt began before a battery error. Finally, batters were credited with a stolen base if they were tagged out after over running the base.

In 1892, a rule credited runners with stolen bases if a base runner advanced on a fly out, or if they advanced more than one base on any safe hit or attempted out, providing an attempt was made by the defense to put the runner out. The rule was rescinded in 1897.

In 1898, stolen base scoring was narrowed to no longer include advancement in the event of a fielding error, or advancement caused by a hit batsman.

1904 saw an attempt to reduce the already wordy slew of rules governing stolen bases, with the stolen base now credited when &quot;the advances a base unaided by a base hit, a put out, (or) a fielding or batter error.&quot;

1910 saw the first addressing of the double and triple steal attempts. Under the new rule, when any runner is thrown out, and the other(s) are successful, the successful runners will not be credited with a stolen base.

Without using the term, 1920 saw the first rule that would be referred to today as defensive indifference, as stolen bases would not be credited, unless an effort was made to stop the runner by the defense. This is usually called if such is attempted in the ninth inning while that player&#x27;s team is trailing, unless the runner represents the potential tying run.

1931 saw a further narrowing of the criteria for awarding a stolen base. Power was given to the official scorer, in the event of a muff by the catcher in throwing, that in the judgment of the scorer the runner would have been out, to credit the catcher with an error, and not credit the runner with a stolen base. Further, any successful steal on a play resulting in a wild pitch, passed ball, or balk would no longer be credited as a steal, even if the runner had started to steal before the play.

One of the largest rewrites to the rules in history came in 1950. The stolen base was specifically to be credited &quot;to a runner whenever he advances one base unaided by a base hit, a putout, a forceout, a fielder&#x27;s choice, a passed ball, a wild pitch, or a balk.&quot;

There were noted exceptions, such as denying a stolen base to an otherwise successful steal as a part of a double or triple steal, if one other runner was thrown out in the process. A stolen base would be awarded to runners who successfully stole second base as a part of a double steal with a man on third, if the other runner failed to steal home, but instead was able to return safely to third base. Runners who are tagged out oversliding the base after an otherwise successful steal would not be credited with a stolen base. Indifference was also credited as an exception. Runners would now be credited with stolen bases if they had begun the act of stealing, and the resulting pitch was wild, or a passed ball. Finally, for 1950 only, runners would be credited with a stolen base if they were &quot;well advanced&quot; toward the base they were attempting to steal, and the pitcher is charged with a balk, with the further exception of a player attempting to steal, who would otherwise have been forced to advance on the balk by a runner behind them. This rule was removed in 1951.

A clarification came in 1955 that awarded a stolen base to a runner even if he became involved in a rundown, provided he evaded the rundown and advanced to the base he intended to steal.

The criteria for &quot;caught stealing&quot; were fine-tuned in 1979, with a runner being charged with being caught if he is put out while trying to steal, overslides a base (otherwise successfully stolen), or is picked off a base and tries to advance to the next base. It is explicitly not caught stealing to be put out after a wild pitch or passed ball.

In 2023, base stealing increased due to new rules affecting pitchers: A pitch clock limited the amount of time a pitcher had to pitch and pickoff attempts were limited to two per at-bat. In addition, the bases were enlarged from to , making stealing slightly easier.

==&quot;Stealing first&quot;==

While not recorded as a stolen base, the same dynamic between batter/runner and defense is on display in the case of an uncaught third strike. The batter/runner can avoid an out and become a baserunner by reaching first base ahead of the throw. This case is a strikeout that is not an out; the batter/runner&#x27;s acquisition of first base is scored as a passed ball, a wild pitch, or an error.

In baseball&#x27;s earlier decades, a runner on second base could &quot;steal&quot; first base, perhaps with the intention of drawing a throw that might allow a runner on third to score (a tactic famously employed by Germany Schaefer). However, such a tactic was not recorded as a stolen base. MLB rules now forbid running clockwise on the basepaths to &quot;confuse the defense or make a travesty of the game&quot;. Further, after the pitcher assumes the pitching position, runners cannot return to any previous base.

In a game on August 16, 1987, Toronto Blue Jays center fielder Lloyd Moseby successfully stole second base on a throwing error by Chicago White Sox catcher Carlton Fisk that went well into center field. However, shortstop Ozzie Guillen faked as if the batter had hit a popfly, which would have required Moseby to return to first base to avoid getting doubled off. Moseby made it back to first base, but another throwing error sent the ball to the infield wall, giving Moseby another chance to steal second, which he did. This chaos led the announcer to say, &quot;He doesn&#x27;t know where the throw is; he&#x27;s going back to first base! Is he going to steal first? He steals first! Now he&#x27;s going to steal second again! I&#x27;ve never seen it before!&quot; This bizarre play was officially scored as a baserunner advancing on a throwing error by the center fielder, ironically resulting in neither a stolen base awarded nor an error charged to the catcher.

In a game on April 19, 2013, Milwaukee Brewers shortstop Jean Segura stole second base in the bottom of the eighth inning. After the batter up, Ryan Braun, walked, Segura broke early for third base and the pitcher, Shawn Camp of the Chicago Cubs, threw ahead of him. As Segura was chased back to second base, Braun advanced to second as well and was tagged out. Segura, thinking &quot;he&quot; was out, began to return to the home dugout behind first base, but first base coach Garth Iorg directed him to stand at first. Segura had not intentionally run the bases backwards as a deception or mockery, but no fielder tried to tag him out. Later in the inning, he attempted to steal second for the second time, but was thrown out by catcher Welington Castillo.

The expression &quot;You can&#x27;t steal first base&quot; is sometimes used in reference to a player who is fast but not very good at getting on base in the first place.

Former Pittsburgh Pirates and Seattle Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon is jokingly referred to as having &quot;stolen first&quot; in a June 26, 2001, game as the manager of the Pirates: after being ejected for disputing a call at first base, he yanked the base out of the ground and left the field with it, delaying the game. Of the incident, McClendon said &quot;I told him he wasn&#x27;t using it, so I thought I&#x27;d take it.&quot; When a groundskeeper came out to replace the bag, the crowd booed him.

The independent Atlantic League instituted a new rule for the second half of the 2019 season, allowing batters to become runners on any pitch not &quot;caught in flight&quot; by the catcher, as they can throughout baseball after most uncaught third strikes. On July 13, 2019, outfielder Tony Thomas of the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs became the first player to reach first base under this rule. The press described this as &quot;stealing first base&quot;, though it is scored as described above.

<text>In baseball, a player is credited with a plate appearance (denoted by PA) each time he completes a turn batting. Under Rule 5.04(c) of the Official Baseball Rules, a player completes a turn batting when he is put out or becomes a runner. This happens when he strikes out or is declared out before reaching first base; or when he reaches first base safely or is awarded first base (by a base on balls, hit by pitch, catcher&#x27;s interference, or obstruction); or when he hits a fair ball which causes a preceding runner to be put out for the third out before he himself is put out or reaches first base safely (&quot;see also&quot; left on base, fielder&#x27;s choice, force play). A very similar baseball statistic, at bats, counts a subset of plate appearances that end under certain circumstances.

== Use as batting record qualifier ==
At bats - rather than plate appearances - are used to calculate batting averages, slugging percentages. However, starting in 1957, at season&#x27;s end a player must have accumulated a minimum number of plate appearances during a season to be ranked as a league-leader in certain statistical categories. For batting championships in MLB, this number is 3.1 plate appearances multiplied by the number of scheduled games in a season, rounded up or down to the nearest whole number. As of 2024, with a 162-game regular season, this means 502 plate appearances are required to qualify. A lesser criterion applies in the minor leagues, with 2.7 plate appearances per game required to qualify.

For example, Player A gets 100 hits in 400 at bats over 510 plate appearances, which works out to a .250 batting average (equivalent to one hit in every four at-bats). Alternatively, Player B gets 110 hits in 400 at bats over 490 plate appearances during the same season, finishing with a .275 batting average. Player B, even though he had the same amount of at bats as Player A and even though his batting average is higher, will not be eligible for certain percentage-based season-ending rankings because he did not accumulate the required 502 plate appearances, while Player A did and therefore will be eligible. There is, however, an exception:

=== Exception for batting titles ===
Rule 9.22(a) of the Official Baseball Rules make a single allowance to the minimum requirement of 502 plate appearances for the purposes of determining the batting, slugging or on-base percentage title. If a player:

* leads the league in one of the statistics;
* does not have the required 502 plate appearances; and
* would still lead the league in that statistic if as many at bats (without hits or reaching base) were added to his records as necessary to meet the requirement,

he will win that title, but with his original statistic (before the extra at bats were added).

In the example above, Player B is 12 plate appearances short of the required 502, but were he be charged with 12 additional unproductive at bats, he would go 110-for-412 for a batting average of .267. If no one else has a batting average (similarly modified if appropriate) higher than .267, player B will be awarded the batting title (with his original batting average of .275) despite the lack of 502 plate appearances.

In a real-life example, in 2012, Melky Cabrera, then of the San Francisco Giants, finished the season with a league-high .346 batting average, but he had only 501 plate appearances, one short of the required 502. Per the rule, he would have won the batting title because after an extra at bat is added and his batting average recalculated, he still would have led the league in batting average. Cabrera&#x27;s case, however, turned out differently. The reason Cabrera finished the season with only 501 plate appearances was because he was suspended in mid-August when he tested positive for illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Cabrera was still eligible for that extra at bat, but he requested that the extra at bat not be added to his total, and that he not be considered for the batting crown, because he admitted that his use of performance-enhancing drugs had given him an unfair advantage over other players. As a result, Cabrera&#x27;s name is nowhere to be found on the list of 2012 National League batting leaders.

== Scoring ==
A batter is not credited with a plate appearance if, while batting, a preceding runner is put out on the basepaths for the third out in a way other than by the batter putting the ball into play (i.e., picked off, caught stealing). In this case, the same batter continues his turn batting in the next inning with no balls or strikes against him.

A batter is not credited with a plate appearance if, while batting, the game ends as the winning run scores from third base on a balk, stolen base, wild pitch or passed ball.

A batter may or may not be credited with a plate appearance (and possibly at bat) in the rare instance when he is replaced by a pinch hitter after having already started his turn at bat. Under Rule 9.15(b), the pinch hitter would receive the plate appearance (and potential of an at-bat) unless the original batter is replaced when having 2 strikes against him and the pinch hitter subsequently completes the strikeout, in which case the plate appearance and at-bat are charged to the first batter.

== Relation to at bat ==
Under Official Baseball Rule 9.02(a)(1), an at bat results from a completed plate appearance, unless the batter:

* hits a sacrifice bunt or sacrifice fly; or
* is awarded first base on four called balls; or
* is hit by a pitched ball; or
* is awarded first base because of interference or obstruction.

In common parlance, the term &quot;at bat&quot; is sometimes used to mean &quot;plate appearance&quot; (for example, &quot;he fouled off the ball to keep the &quot;at bat&quot; alive&quot;). The intent is usually clear from the context, although the term &quot;official at bat&quot; is sometimes used to explicitly refer to an &quot;at bat&quot; as distinguished from a &quot;plate appearance&quot;. However, terms such as &quot;turn at bat&quot; or &quot;time at bat&quot; are synonymous with &quot;plate appearance&quot;.

=== &quot;Time at bat&quot; in the rulebook ===
Official Baseball Rule 5.06(c) provides that &quot;[a] batter has legally completed his &quot;time at bat&quot; when he is put out or becomes a runner&quot; (emphasis added). The &quot;time at bat&quot; defined in this rule is more commonly referred to as a plate appearance, and the playing rules (Rules 1 through 8) uses the phrase &quot;time at bat&quot; in this sense (e.g. Rule 5.04(a)(3), which states that &quot;[t]he first batter in each inning after the first inning shall be the player whose name follows that of the last player who legally completed his &quot;time at bat&quot; in the preceding inning&quot; (emphasis added)). In contrast, the scoring rules uses the phrase &quot;time at bat&quot; to refer to the statistic at bat, defined in Rule 9.02(a)(1), but sometimes uses the phrase &quot;official time at bat&quot; or refers back to Rule 9.02(a)(1) when mentioning the statistic. The phrase &quot;plate appearance&quot; is used in Rules 9.22 and 9.23 dealing with batting titles and hitting streaks, and in Rule 5.10(g) Comment in relation to the Three-Batter Minimum: &quot;[t]o qualify as one of three consecutive batters, the batter must complete his &quot;plate appearance&quot;, which ends only when the batter is put out or becomes a runner.&quot; (emphasis added) The term is not elsewhere defined in the rulebook.

==In on-base percentage==
Plate appearances are a primary component in calculating on-base percentage (OBP), an alternative measurement of a player&#x27;s offensive performance, but are not the only one in determining its denominator.

By rule, certain plate appearances, such as times reached base via either catcher&#x27;s interference or fielder&#x27;s obstruction or sacrifice bunts, are excluded from it, leaving the denominator determined instead as the sum of at-bats, walks, hit-by-pitches, and sacrifice flies. And the numerator represented by a batter&#x27;s times on base (composed of the sum of hits, base on balls, and times hit by pitch).

== Other uses ==
Plate appearances are used by scorers for &quot;proving&quot; a box score. Under Rule 9.03(c), the following two items should be equal for each team, because each is equal to the team&#x27;s total number of plate appearances:

* The sum of the team&#x27;s at bats, walks, hit by pitches, sacrifices (both bunts and flies), and times awarded first base on interference or obstruction.
* The sum of the team&#x27;s runs, runners left on base, and men put out.

<text>Games played (GP) is a statistic used in team sports to indicate the total number of games in which a player has participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective of whatever portion of the game is contested.

==Association football==
In association football, a game played is counted if a player is in the starting 11, or if a reserve player enters the game before full-time.

==Baseball==
In baseball, the statistic applies to players, who prior to a game, are included on a starting lineup card or are announced as an &quot;ex ante&quot; substitute, whether or not they play. For pitchers only, the statistic games pitched is used.

A notable example of the application of the above rule is pitcher Larry Yount, who suffered an injury while throwing warmup pitches after being summoned as a reliever in a Major League Baseball (MLB) game on September 15, 1971. He did not face a batter, but was credited with an appearance because he had been announced as a substitute. Yount never appeared in (or actually played in) any other MLB game.

==Basketball==

Robert Parish has the NBA record for most regular season games played, with 1,611. A. C. Green has the NBA record for most consecutive games played, with 1,192.

<doc id="3817" wikidata="Q892968" url="?curid=3817" title="Boogie Down Productions">
<text>Boogie Down Productions (BDP) was an American hip hop group originally composed of KRS-One, D-Nice, and DJ Scott La Rock. DJ Scott La Rock was murdered on August 27, 1987, five months after the release of BDP&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Criminal Minded&quot;. The name of the group, Boogie Down, derives from a nickname for the South Bronx section of New York City. The group pioneered the fusion of dancehall reggae and hip hop music and their debut LP &quot;Criminal Minded&quot; contained frank descriptions of life in the South Bronx during the late 1980s, thus setting the stage for what would eventually become Hip Hop.

== Members ==
BDP&#x27;s membership changed throughout its existence, the only constant being KRS-One. The group was founded by KRS-One and DJ Scott La Rock, with producer Lee Smith, who was essential in the production of the songs on &quot;Criminal Minded&quot;, being added as a member shortly after. From those beginnings, BDP members and collaborators included Ced Gee of Ultramagnetic MC&#x27;s, Lee Smith, Scott La Rock, D-Nice, Henry Wilkerson PoppyDa, Kenny Parker (KRS-One&#x27;s younger brother), Just-Ice, ICU, McBoo, Ms. Melodie, Heather B., Scottie Morris, Tony Rahsan, Willie D., RoboCop, Harmony, DJ Red Alert, Jay Kramer, D-Square, Rebekah Foster, Scott Whitehill, Scott King, Chris Tait and Sidney Mills. BDP as a group essentially ended because KRS-One began recording and performing under his own name rather than the group name. Lee Smith, who has co-producer credit on the original 12&quot; &quot;South Bronx&quot; single, was the first to be jettisoned by KRS-One and the future new label after Scott&#x27;s death.

In the liner notes on BDP&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Sex and Violence&quot;, KRS-One writes: &quot;BDP in 1992 is KRS-One, Willie D, and Kenny Parker! BDP is not D-Nice, Jamal-Ski, Harmony, Ms. Melodie, and Scottie Morris. They are not down with BDP so stop frontin&#x27;.&quot; Steve &quot;Flash&quot; Juon of RapReviews.com claimed that this initiated the ultimate breakup of the group.

== Cultural influences and impact ==
=== &quot;The Bridge Wars&quot; ===
A conflict arose in the late 1980s concerning the origins of hip-hop, and BDP made conscious efforts in its early work to establish its interpretation of the issue. The origins of hip-hop to many, including BDP, are believed to be from the Bronx. A rival hip-hop collective, known as the Juice Crew&#x27;s lyrics, were misunderstood to contain a claim in the song &quot;The Bridge&quot; that hip hop was directly a result of artists originating from Queensbridge. Boogie Down and KRS retorted angrily with songs such as &quot;The Bridge is Over&quot; and &quot;South Bronx,&quot; which started one of the first notable hip hop wars as MC Shan, Marley Marl, Roxanne Shanté and Blaq Poet all released songs featuring verses personally attacking KRS and Scott La Rock. But the Bridge Wars were short-lived, and after Scott La Rock&#x27;s death, KRS began to concentrate on socially conscious music.

While &quot;Criminal Minded&quot; contained vivid descriptions of South Bronx street life, BDP changed after Scott&#x27;s death. Lee Smith was dropped and KRS-One adopted the Teacha moniker and made a deliberate attempt at creating politically and socially conscious hip-hop. BDP was influential in provoking political and social consciousness in hip-hop, for example in &quot;Stop The Violence&quot; on 1988&#x27;s &quot;By All Means Necessary&quot;.

=== Jamaican inspirations ===
The Jamaican influence in &quot;Criminal Minded&quot; is well illustrated by the use of the &quot;Mad Mad&quot; or &quot;Diseases&quot; riddim started in 1981 with reggae star Yellowman&#x27;s song &quot;Zunguzunguzeng.&quot; BDP used this riff in the song &quot;Remix for P is Free,&quot; and it was later resampled by artists such as Black Star and dead prez. As an album regarded by many as the start of the gangsta rap movement, &quot;Criminal Minded&quot; played an important role in reaffirming the social acceptance of having Jamaican roots. BDP referenced reggae in a way that helped to solidify Jamaica&#x27;s place in modern hip-hop culture.

== Political and social activism ==
From its start, BDP affected the development of hip-hop and gave a sincere voice to the reality of life in the South Bronx, a section of New York City clouded with poverty and crime. With &quot;Criminal Minded&quot;, the group combined the sounds of LaRock&#x27;s harsh, spare, reggae-influenced beats and KRS-One&#x27;s long-winded rhyme style on underground classics such as &quot;9mm Goes Bang&quot; and &quot;South Bronx,&quot; the album&#x27;s gritty portrait of life on the streets (as well as the firearms that adorned its cover) influenced the gangsta rap movement that began in earnest two years later.

BDP&#x27;s influence in the creation and development of gangsta rap highlights the cultural significance and impact of the type of music BDP and other early hip-hop artists like it created. This subgenre of hip-hop is most closely associated with hard-core hip-hop and is widely misinterpreted as promoting violence and gang activity. This misinterpretation or stigma is closely related to Boogie Down Productions and the general purpose behind their underlying themes of violence. For instance, the cover art of &quot;Criminal Minded&quot; displays the two artists in the group brandishing drawn guns and displaying other firearms. This is not an encouragement of the violence described in BDP&#x27;s music, but a portrayal of the violence in the South Bronx as a means of expression, escape, and even condemnation. This album art is not meant to advocate violence but to challenge the conception of a criminal, to assert that those who are really criminally minded are those who hold power.

BDP&#x27;s music became significantly more politically astute after Scott La Rock&#x27;s death. KRS-One published four more albums under the title Boogie Down Productions, and each was increasingly innovative and expanded from the thuggish imagery of &quot;Criminal Minded,&quot; exploring themes like black-on-black crime and black radicalism, using a riff on the words of Malcolm X, &quot;by any means necessary&quot;, which became the title of the second BDP album, and remains one of the most political hip-hop albums to date. It was in this album that KRS defined himself as the &quot;teacha&quot; or &quot;teacher&quot;, symbolizing his emphasis on educating his audience members and fans about relevant social issues surrounding the African-American experience.

During his time in association with Boogie Down Productions, KRS-One joined other rappers to create the Stop the Violence Movement, which addressed many of the issues brought up in BDP&#x27;s music and is the most conscious effort displayed by KRS-One and BDP of political activism and engagement. The movement created the single &quot;Self-Destruction&quot; in 1989 through the collaboration of BDP (KRS-One, D-Nice &amp; Ms. Melodie), Stetsasonic (Delite, Daddy-O, Wise, and Frukwan), Kool Moe Dee, MC Lyte, Doug E. Fresh, Just-Ice, Heavy D, Biz Markie, and Public Enemy (Chuck D &amp; Flavor Flav), with the aim of spreading awareness about violence in African-American and hip-hop communities. All proceeds from this effort went to the National Urban League.

<doc id="3821" wikidata="Q276582" url="?curid=3821" title="Binary-coded decimal">
<text>In computing and electronic systems, binary-coded decimal (BCD) is a class of binary encodings of decimal numbers where each digit is represented by a fixed number of bits, usually four or eight. Sometimes, special bit patterns are used for a sign or other indications (e.g. error or overflow).

In byte-oriented systems (i.e. most modern computers), the term &quot;unpacked&quot; BCD usually implies a full byte for each digit (often including a sign), whereas &quot;packed&quot; BCD typically encodes two digits within a single byte by taking advantage of the fact that four bits are enough to represent the range 0 to 9. The precise four-bit encoding, however, may vary for technical reasons (e.g. Excess-3).

The ten states representing a BCD digit are sometimes called &quot;tetrades&quot; (the nibble typically needed to hold them is also known as a tetrade) while the unused, don&#x27;t care-states are named &quot;pseudo-tetrad(e)s&quot;, &quot;pseudo-decimals&quot;, or &quot;pseudo-decimal digits&quot;.

BCD&#x27;s main virtue, in comparison to binary positional systems, is its more accurate representation and rounding of decimal quantities, as well as its ease of conversion into conventional human-readable representations. Its principal drawbacks are a slight increase in the complexity of the circuits needed to implement basic arithmetic as well as slightly less dense storage.

BCD was used in many early decimal computers, and is implemented in the instruction set of machines such as the IBM System/360 series and its descendants, Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s VAX, the Burroughs B1700, and the Motorola 68000-series processors.

BCD &quot;per se&quot; is not as widely used as in the past, and is unavailable or limited in newer instruction sets (e.g., ARM; x86 in long mode). However, decimal fixed-point and decimal floating-point formats are still important and continue to be used in financial, commercial, and industrial computing, where the subtle conversion and fractional rounding errors that are inherent in binary floating point formats cannot be tolerated.

==Background==
BCD takes advantage of the fact that any one decimal numeral can be represented by a four-bit pattern. An obvious way of encoding digits is &quot;Natural BCD&quot; (NBCD), where each decimal digit is represented by its corresponding four-bit binary value, as shown in the following table. This is also called &quot;8421&quot; encoding.

This scheme can also be referred to as &quot;Simple Binary-Coded Decimal&quot; (&quot;SBCD&quot;) or &quot;BCD 8421&quot;, and is the most common encoding. Others include the so-called &quot;4221&quot; and &quot;7421&quot; encoding – named after the weighting used for the bits – and &quot;Excess-3&quot;. For example, the BCD digit 6, in 8421 notation, is in 4221 (two encodings are possible), in 7421, while in Excess-3 it is (formula_1).

The following table represents decimal digits from 0 to 9 in various BCD encoding systems. In the headers, the &quot;codice_1&quot; indicates the weight of each bit. In the fifth column (&quot;BCD 84−2−1&quot;), two of the weights are negative. Both ASCII and EBCDIC character codes for the digits, which are examples of zoned BCD, are also shown.

As most computers deal with data in 8-bit bytes, it is possible to use one of the following methods to encode a BCD number:
* Unpacked: Each decimal digit is encoded into one byte, with four bits representing the number and the remaining bits having no significance.
* Packed: Two decimal digits are encoded into a single byte, with one digit in the least significant nibble (bits 0 through 3) and the other numeral in the most significant nibble (bits 4 through 7).

As an example, encoding the decimal number codice_2 using unpacked BCD results in the following binary pattern of two bytes:
 Decimal: 9 1
 Binary : 0000 1001 0000 0001

In packed BCD, the same number would fit into a single byte:
 Decimal: 9 1
 Binary : 1001 0001

Hence the numerical range for one unpacked BCD byte is zero through nine inclusive, whereas the range for one packed BCD byte is zero through ninety-nine inclusive.

To represent numbers larger than the range of a single byte any number of contiguous bytes may be used. For example, to represent the decimal number codice_3 in packed BCD, using big-endian format, a program would encode as follows:
 Decimal: 0 1 2 3 4 5
 Binary : 0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101

Here, the most significant nibble of the most significant byte has been encoded as zero, so the number is stored as codice_4 (but formatting routines might replace or remove leading zeros). Packed BCD is more efficient in storage usage than unpacked BCD; encoding the same number (with the leading zero) in unpacked format would consume twice the storage.

Shifting and masking operations are used to pack or unpack a packed BCD digit. Other bitwise operations are used to convert a numeral to its equivalent bit pattern or reverse the process.

==Packed BCD==

In packed BCD (or packed decimal), each nibble represents a decimal digit. Packed BCD has been in use since at least the 1960s and is implemented in all IBM mainframe hardware since then. Most implementations are big endian, i.e. with the more significant digit in the upper half of each byte, and with the leftmost byte (residing at the lowest memory address) containing the most significant digits of the packed decimal value. The lower nibble of the rightmost byte is usually used as the sign flag, although some unsigned representations lack a sign flag.

As an example, a 4-byte value consists of 8 nibbles, wherein the upper 7 nibbles store the digits of a 7-digit decimal value, and the lowest nibble indicates the sign of the decimal integer value. Standard sign values are 1100 (hex C) for positive (+) and 1101 (D) for negative (−). This convention comes from the zone field for EBCDIC characters and the signed overpunch representation.

Other allowed signs are 1010 (A) and 1110 (E) for positive and 1011 (B) for negative. IBM System/360 processors will use the 1010 (A) and 1011 (B) signs if the A bit is set in the PSW, for the ASCII-8 standard that never passed. Most implementations also provide unsigned BCD values with a sign nibble of 1111 (F). ILE RPG uses 1111 (F) for positive and 1101 (D) for negative. These match the EBCDIC zone for digits without a sign overpunch. In packed BCD, the number 127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1100 (127C) and −127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1101 (127D). Burroughs systems used 1101 (D) for negative, and any other value is considered a positive sign value (the processors will normalize a positive sign to 1100 (C)).
No matter how many bytes wide a word is, there is always an even number of nibbles because each byte has two of them. Therefore, a word of &quot;n&quot; bytes can contain up to (2&quot;n&quot;)−1 decimal digits, which is always an odd number of digits. A decimal number with &quot;d&quot; digits requires (&quot;d&quot;+1) bytes of storage space.

For example, a 4-byte (32-bit) word can hold seven decimal digits plus a sign and can represent values ranging from ±9,999,999. Thus the number −1,234,567 is 7 digits wide and is encoded as:
 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1101
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 −

Like character strings, the first byte of the packed decimal that with the most significant two digits is usually stored in the lowest address in memory, independent of the endianness of the machine.

In contrast, a 4-byte binary two&#x27;s complement integer can represent values from −2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.

While packed BCD does not make optimal use of storage (using about 20% more memory than binary notation to store the same numbers), conversion to ASCII, EBCDIC, or the various encodings of Unicode is made trivial, as no arithmetic operations are required. The extra storage requirements are usually offset by the need for the accuracy and compatibility with calculator or hand calculation that fixed-point decimal arithmetic provides. Denser packings of BCD exist which avoid the storage penalty and also need no arithmetic operations for common conversions.

Packed BCD is supported in the COBOL programming language as the &quot;COMPUTATIONAL-3&quot; (an IBM extension adopted by many other compiler vendors) or &quot;PACKED-DECIMAL&quot; (part of the 1985 COBOL standard) data type. It is supported in PL/I as &quot;FIXED DECIMAL&quot;. Beside the IBM System/360 and later compatible mainframes, packed BCD is implemented in the native instruction set of the original VAX processors from Digital Equipment Corporation and some models of the SDS Sigma series mainframes, and is the native format for the Burroughs Medium Systems line of mainframes (descended from the 1950s Electrodata 200 series).

Ten&#x27;s complement representations for negative numbers offer an alternative approach to encoding the sign of packed (and other) BCD numbers. In this case, positive numbers always have a most significant digit between 0 and 4 (inclusive), while negative numbers are represented by the 10&#x27;s complement of the corresponding positive number.

As a result, this system allows for 32-bit packed BCD numbers to range from −50,000,000 to +49,999,999, and −1 is represented as 99999999. (As with two&#x27;s complement binary numbers, the range is not symmetric about zero.)

===Fixed-point packed decimal===
Fixed-point decimal numbers are supported by some programming languages (such as COBOL and PL/I). These languages allow the programmer to specify an implicit decimal point in front of one of the digits.

For example, a packed decimal value encoded with the bytes 12 34 56 7C represents the fixed-point value +1,234.567 when the implied decimal point is located between the fourth and fifth digits:
 12 34 56 7C
 &quot;12 34.56 7+&quot;

The decimal point is not actually stored in memory, as the packed BCD storage format does not provide for it. Its location is simply known to the compiler, and the generated code acts accordingly for the various arithmetic operations.

===Higher-density encodings===
If a decimal digit requires four bits, then three decimal digits require 12 bits. However, since 210 (1,024) is greater than 103 (1,000), if three decimal digits are encoded together, only 10 bits are needed. Two such encodings are &quot;Chen–Ho encoding&quot; and &quot;densely packed decimal&quot; (DPD). The latter has the advantage that subsets of the encoding encode two digits in the optimal seven bits and one digit in four bits, as in regular BCD.

==Zoned decimal==
Some implementations, for example IBM mainframe systems, support zoned decimal numeric representations. Each decimal digit is stored in one 8-bit byte, with the lower four bits encoding the digit in BCD form. The upper four bits, called the &quot;zone&quot; bits, are usually set to a fixed value so that the byte holds a character value corresponding to the digit, or to values representing plus or minus. EBCDIC systems use a zone value of (), yielding -, the codes for &quot;0&quot; through &quot;9&quot;, a zone value of () for positive, yielding -, the codes for &quot;{&quot; through &quot;I&quot; and a zone value of () for negative, yielding -, the codes for the characters &quot;}&quot; through &quot;R&quot;. Similarly, ASCII systems use a zone value of 0011 (hex 3), giving character codes 30 to 39 (hex).

For signed zoned decimal values, the rightmost (least significant) zone nibble holds the sign digit, which is the same set of values that are used for signed packed decimal numbers (see above). Thus a zoned decimal value encoded as the hex bytes F1 F2 D3 represents the signed decimal value −123:
 F1 F2 D3
 1 2 −3

===Fixed-point zoned decimal===
Some languages (such as COBOL and PL/I) directly support fixed-point zoned decimal values, assigning an implicit decimal point at some location between the decimal digits of a number.

For example, given a six-byte signed zoned decimal value with an implied decimal point to the right of the fourth digit, the hex bytes F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0 represent the value +1,279.50:
 F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0
 1 2 7 9. 5 +0

== Operations with BCD ==

=== Addition ===
It is possible to perform addition by first adding in binary, and then converting to BCD afterwards. Conversion of the simple sum of two digits can be done by adding 6 (that is, 16 − 10) when the five-bit result of adding a pair of digits has a value greater than 9. The reason for adding 6 is that there are 16 possible 4-bit BCD values (since 24 = 16), but only 10 values are valid (0000 through 1001). For example:
 1001 + 1000 = 10001
 9 + 8 = 17
10001 is the binary, not decimal, representation of the desired result, but the most significant 1 (the &quot;carry&quot;) cannot fit in a 4-bit binary number. In BCD as in decimal, there cannot exist a value greater than 9 (1001) per digit. To correct this, 6 (0110) is added to the total, and then the result is treated as two nibbles:
 10001 + 0110 = 00010111 =&gt; 0001 0111
 17 + 6 = 23 1 7
The two nibbles of the result, 0001 and 0111, correspond to the digits &quot;1&quot; and &quot;7&quot;. This yields &quot;17&quot; in BCD, which is the correct result.

This technique can be extended to adding multiple digits by adding in groups from right to left, propagating the second digit as a carry, always comparing the 5-bit result of each digit-pair sum to 9. Some CPUs provide a half-carry flag to facilitate BCD arithmetic adjustments following binary addition and subtraction operations. The Intel 8080, the Zilog Z80 and the CPUs of the x86 family provide the opcode DAA (Decimal Adjust Accumulator).

=== Subtraction ===
Subtraction is done by adding the ten&#x27;s complement of the subtrahend to the minuend. To represent the sign of a number in BCD, the number 0000 is used to represent a positive number, and 1001 is used to represent a negative number. The remaining 14 combinations are invalid signs. To illustrate signed BCD subtraction, consider the following problem: 357 − 432.

In signed BCD, 357 is 0000 0011 0101 0111. The ten&#x27;s complement of 432 can be obtained by taking the nine&#x27;s complement of 432, and then adding one. So, 999 − 432 = 567, and 567 + 1 = 568. By preceding 568 in BCD by the negative sign code, the number −432 can be represented. So, −432 in signed BCD is 1001 0101 0110 1000.

Now that both numbers are represented in signed BCD, they can be added together:
 0000 0011 0101 0111
 0 3 5 7
 + 1001 0101 0110 1000
 9 5 6 8
 = 1001 1000 1011 1111
 9 8 11 15
Since BCD is a form of decimal representation, several of the digit sums above are invalid. In the event that an invalid entry (any BCD digit greater than 1001) exists, 6 is added to generate a carry bit and cause the sum to become a valid entry. So, adding 6 to the invalid entries results in the following:
 1001 1000 1011 1111
 9 8 11 15
 + 0000 0000 0110 0110
 0 0 6 6
 = 1001 1001 0010 0101
 9 9 2 5
Thus the result of the subtraction is 1001 1001 0010 0101 (−925). To confirm the result, note that the first digit is 9, which means negative. This seems to be correct since 357 − 432 should result in a negative number. The remaining nibbles are BCD, so 1001 0010 0101 is 925. The ten&#x27;s complement of 925 is 1000 − 925 = 75, so the calculated answer is −75.

If there are a different number of nibbles being added together (such as 1053 − 2), the number with the fewer digits must first be prefixed with zeros before taking the ten&#x27;s complement or subtracting. So, with 1053 − 2, 2 would have to first be represented as 0002 in BCD, and the ten&#x27;s complement of 0002 would have to be calculated.

==BCD in computers==
===IBM===

IBM used the terms &quot;Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code&quot; (BCDIC, sometimes just called BCD), for 6-bit &quot;alphanumeric&quot; codes that represented numbers, upper-case letters and special characters. Some variation of BCDIC &quot;alphamerics&quot; is used in most early IBM computers, including the IBM 1620 (introduced in 1959), IBM 1400 series, and non-decimal architecture members of the IBM 700/7000 series.

The IBM 1400 series are character-addressable machines, each location being six bits labeled &quot;B, A, 8, 4, 2&quot; and &quot;1,&quot; plus an odd parity check bit (&quot;C&quot;) and a word mark bit (&quot;M&quot;). For encoding digits &quot;1&quot; through &quot;9&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;A&quot; are zero and the digit value represented by standard 4-bit BCD in bits &quot;8&quot; through &quot;1&quot;. For most other characters bits &quot;B&quot; and &quot;A&quot; are derived simply from the &quot;12&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, and &quot;0&quot; &quot;zone punches&quot; in the punched card character code, and bits &quot;8&quot; through &quot;1&quot; from the &quot;1&quot; through &quot;9&quot; punches. A &quot;12 zone&quot; punch set both &quot;B&quot; and &quot;A&quot;, an &quot;11 zone&quot; set &quot;B&quot;, and a &quot;0 zone&quot; (a 0 punch combined with any others) set &quot;A&quot;. Thus the letter A, which is &quot;(12,1)&quot; in the punched card format, is encoded &quot;(B,A,1)&quot;. The currency symbol $, &quot;(11,8,3)&quot; in the punched card, was encoded in memory as &quot;(B,8,2,1)&quot;. This allows the circuitry to convert between the punched card format and the internal storage format to be very simple with only a few special cases. One important special case is digit &quot;0&quot;, represented by a lone &quot;0&quot; punch in the card, and &quot;(8,2)&quot; in core memory.

The memory of the IBM 1620 is organized into 6-bit addressable digits, the usual &quot;8, 4, 2, 1&quot; plus &quot;F&quot;, used as a flag bit and &quot;C&quot;, an odd parity check bit. BCD &quot;alphamerics&quot; are encoded using digit pairs, with the &quot;zone&quot; in the even-addressed digit and the &quot;digit&quot; in the odd-addressed digit, the &quot;zone&quot; being related to the &quot;12&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, and &quot;0&quot; &quot;zone punches&quot; as in the 1400 series. Input/output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.

In the decimal architecture IBM 7070, IBM 7072, and IBM 7074 &quot;alphamerics&quot; are encoded using digit pairs (using two-out-of-five code in the digits, not BCD) of the 10-digit word, with the &quot;zone&quot; in the left digit and the &quot;digit&quot; in the right digit. Input/output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.

With the introduction of System/360, IBM expanded 6-bit BCD &quot;alphamerics&quot; to 8-bit EBCDIC, allowing the addition of many more characters (e.g., lowercase letters). A variable length packed BCD &quot;numeric&quot; data type is also implemented, providing machine instructions that perform arithmetic directly on packed decimal data.

On the IBM 1130 and 1800, packed BCD is supported in software by IBM&#x27;s Commercial Subroutine Package.

Today, BCD data is still heavily used in IBM databases such as IBM Db2 and processors such as z/Architecture and POWER6 and later Power ISA processors. In these products, the BCD is usually zoned BCD (as in EBCDIC or ASCII), packed BCD (two decimal digits per byte), or &quot;pure&quot; BCD encoding (one decimal digit stored as BCD in the low four bits of each byte). All of these are used within hardware registers and processing units, and in software.

=== Other computers ===
The Digital Equipment Corporation VAX series includes instructions that can perform arithmetic directly on packed BCD data and convert between packed BCD data and other integer representations. The VAX&#x27;s packed BCD format is compatible with that on IBM System/360 and IBM&#x27;s later compatible processors. The MicroVAX and later VAX implementations dropped this ability from the CPU but retained code compatibility with earlier machines by implementing the missing instructions in an operating system-supplied software library. This is invoked automatically via exception handling when the defunct instructions are encountered, so that programs using them can execute without modification on the newer machines.

Many processors have hardware support for BCD-encoded integer arithmetic. For example, the 6502, the Motorola 68000 series, and the x86 series. The Intel x86 architecture supports a unique 18-digit (ten-byte) BCD format that can be loaded into and stored from the floating point registers, from where computations can be performed.

In more recent computers such capabilities are almost always implemented in software rather than the CPU&#x27;s instruction set, but BCD numeric data are still extremely common in commercial and financial applications.

There are tricks for implementing packed BCD and zoned decimal add–or–subtract operations using short but difficult to understand sequences of word-parallel logic and binary arithmetic operations. For example, the following code (written in C) computes an unsigned 8-digit packed BCD addition using 32-bit binary operations:

uint32_t BCDadd(uint32_t a, uint32_t b)
 uint32_t t1, t2; // unsigned 32-bit intermediate values

 t1 = a + 0x06666666;
 t2 = t1 ^ b; // sum without carry propagation
 t1 = t1 + b; // provisional sum
 t2 = t1 ^ t2; // all the binary carry bits
 t2 = ~t2 &amp; 0x11111110; // just the BCD carry bits
 t2 = (t2 » 2) | (t2 » 3); // correction
 return t1 - t2; // corrected BCD sum


==BCD in electronics==
BCD is common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor. By employing BCD, the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit.

This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware—a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical seven-segment displays to build a metering circuit, for example. If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary, interfacing with such a display would require complex circuitry. Therefore, in cases where the calculations are relatively simple, working throughout with BCD can lead to an overall simpler system than converting to and from binary. Most pocket calculators do all their calculations in BCD.

The same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, representing numbers internally in BCD format results in smaller code, since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors. For these applications, some small processors feature dedicated arithmetic modes, which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities.

==Comparison with pure binary==

=== Advantages ===
* Scaling by a power of 10 is simple.
* Rounding at a decimal digit boundary is simpler. Addition and subtraction in decimal do not require rounding.
* The alignment of two decimal numbers (for example 1.3 + 27.08) is a simple, exact shift.
* Conversion to a character form or for display (e.g., to a text-based format such as XML, or to drive signals for a seven-segment display) is a simple per-digit mapping, and can be done in linear (O(&quot;n&quot;)) time. Conversion from pure binary involves relatively complex logic that spans digits, and for large numbers, no linear-time conversion algorithm is known (see ).
* Many non-integral values, such as decimal 0.2, have an infinite place-value representation in binary (.001100110011...) but have a finite place-value in binary-coded decimal (0.0010). Consequently, a system based on binary-coded decimal representations of decimal fractions avoids errors representing and calculating such values. This is useful in financial calculations.

=== Disadvantages ===
* Practical existing implementations of BCD are typically slower than operations on binary representations, especially on embedded systems, due to limited processor support for native BCD operations.
* Some operations are more complex to implement. Adders require extra logic to cause them to wrap and generate a carry early. Also, 15 to 20 per cent more circuitry is needed for BCD add compared to pure binary. Multiplication requires the use of algorithms that are somewhat more complex than shift-mask-add (a binary multiplication, requiring binary shifts and adds or the equivalent, per-digit or group of digits is required).
* Standard BCD requires four bits per digit, roughly 20 per cent more space than a binary encoding (the ratio of 4 bits to log210 bits is 1.204). When packed so that three digits are encoded in ten bits, the storage overhead is greatly reduced, at the expense of an encoding that is unaligned with the 8-bit byte boundaries common on existing hardware, resulting in slower implementations on these systems.

==Representational variations==
Various BCD implementations exist that employ other representations for numbers. Programmable calculators manufactured by Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard, and others typically employ a floating-point BCD format, typically with two or three digits for the (decimal) exponent. The extra bits of the sign digit may be used to indicate special numeric values, such as infinity, underflow/overflow, and error (a blinking display).

===Signed variations===
Signed decimal values may be represented in several ways. The COBOL programming language, for example, supports five zoned decimal formats, with each one encoding the numeric sign in a different way:
===Telephony binary-coded decimal (TBCD)===
3GPP developed TBCD, an expansion to BCD where the remaining (unused) bit combinations are used to add specific telephony characters, with digits similar to those found in telephone keypads original design.
The mentioned 3GPP document defines TBCD-STRING with swapped nibbles in each byte. Bits, octets and digits indexed from 1, bits from the right, digits and octets from the left.

bits 8765 of octet &quot;n&quot; encoding digit 2&quot;n&quot;

bits 4321 of octet &quot;n&quot; encoding digit 2(&quot;n&quot; – 1) + 1
Meaning number codice_5, would become codice_6 in TBCD.

This format is used in modern mobile telephony to send dialed numbers, as well as operator ID (the MCC/MNC tuple), IMEI, IMSI (SUPI), et.c.

==Alternative encodings==
If errors in representation and computation are more important than the speed of conversion to and from display, a scaled binary representation may be used, which stores a decimal number as a binary-encoded integer and a binary-encoded signed decimal exponent. For example, 0.2 can be represented as 2.

This representation allows rapid multiplication and division, but may require shifting by a power of 10 during addition and subtraction to align the decimal points. It is appropriate for applications with a fixed number of decimal places that do not then require this adjustment—particularly financial applications where 2 or 4 digits after the decimal point are usually enough. Indeed, this is almost a form of fixed point arithmetic since the position of the radix point is implied.

The Hertz and Chen–Ho encodings provide Boolean transformations for converting groups of three BCD-encoded digits to and from 10-bit values that can be efficiently encoded in hardware with only 2 or 3 gate delays. Densely packed decimal (DPD) is a similar scheme that is used for most of the significand, except the lead digit, for one of the two alternative decimal encodings specified in the IEEE 754-2008 floating-point standard.

==Application==
The BIOS in many personal computers stores the date and time in BCD because the MC6818 real-time clock chip used in the original IBM PC AT motherboard provided the time encoded in BCD. This form is easily converted into ASCII for display.

The Atari 8-bit computers use a BCD format for floating point numbers. The MOS Technology 6502 processor has a BCD mode for the addition and subtraction instructions. The Psion Organiser 1 handheld computer&#x27;s manufacturer-supplied software also uses BCD to implement floating point; later Psion models use binary exclusively.

Early models of the PlayStation 3 store the date and time in BCD. This led to a worldwide outage of the console on 1 March 2010. The last two digits of the year stored as BCD were misinterpreted as 16 causing an error in the unit&#x27;s date, rendering most functions inoperable. This has been referred to as the Year 2010 problem.

==Legal history==
In the 1972 case &quot;Gottschalk v. Benson&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court&#x27;s decision that had allowed a patent for converting BCD-encoded numbers to binary on a computer.

The decision noted that a patent &quot;would wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a patent on the algorithm itself&quot;. This was a landmark judgement that determined the patentability of software and algorithms.

<text>Bumin Qaghan (, also known as Illig Qaghan (Chinese: 伊利可汗, Pinyin: Yīlì Kèhán, Wade–Giles: i-li k&#x27;o-han) or Yamï Qaghan (, died 552 AD) was the founder of the Turkic Khaganate. He was the eldest son of Ashina Tuwu (吐務 / 吐务). He was the chieftain of the Turks under the sovereignty of Rouran Khaganate. He is also mentioned as Tumen (, , commander of ten thousand) of the Rouran Khaganate.

== Early life and reign ==
According to &quot;History of Northern Dynasties&quot; and &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, in 545 Tumen&#x27;s tribe started to rise and frequently invaded the western frontier of Wei. The chancellor of Western Wei, Yuwen Tai, sent An Nuopanto (安諾盤陀, Nanai-Banda, a Sogdian from Bukhara,) as an emissary to the Göktürk chieftain Tumen, in an attempt to establish a commercial relationship. In 546, Tumen paid tribute to the Western Wei state. In that same year, Tumen put down a revolt of the Tiele tribes against the Rouran Khaganate, their overlords. Following this, Tumen felt entitled to request of the Rouran a princess as his wife. The Rouran khagan, Anagui, sent a message refusing this request and adding: &quot;You are my blacksmith slave. How dare you utter these words?&quot; Bumin got angry, killed Anagui&#x27;s emissary, and severed relations with the Rouran Khaganate. Anagui&#x27;s &quot;blacksmith&quot; ( / 锻奴, Pinyin: duàn nú, Wade–Giles: tuan-nu) insult was recorded in Chinese chronicles. Some sources state that members of the Turks (referred as &quot;Tujue&quot; in Chinese sources) did serve as blacksmiths for the Rouran elite, and that &quot;blacksmith slavery&quot; may refer to a kind of vassalage that prevailed in Rouran society. Nevertheless, after this incident Bumin emerged as the leader of the revolt against Rouran.

In 551, Bumin requested a Western Wei princess in marriage. Yuwen Tai permitted it and sent Princess Changle(長樂公主) of Western Wei to Bumin. In the same year when Emperor Wen of Western Wei died, Bumin sent mission and gave two hundred horses.

The beginning of formal diplomatic relations with China propped up Bumin&#x27;s authority among the Turks. He eventually united the local Turkic tribes and threw off the yoke of the Rouran domination. In 552 Bumin&#x27;s army defeated Anagui&#x27;s forces at the north of Huaihuang and then Anagui committed suicide. With their defeat Bumin proclaimed himself &quot;Illig Qaghan&quot; and made his wife qaghatun. &quot;Illig&quot; means Ilkhan (i.e. ruler of people) in Old Turkic. According to the Bilge Qaghan&#x27;s memorial complex and the Kul Tigin&#x27;s memorial complex, Bumin and Istemi ruled people by Turkic laws and they developed them.

== Death and family ==
Bumin died within several months after proclaiming himself Illig Qaghan. He was married to Princess Changle of Western Wei. 

Issue:

* Ashina Keluo (阿史那科罗) - Issig Qaghan
* Ashina Qijin (阿史那俟斤) - Muqan Qaghan
* Taspar Qaghan
* Ashina Kutou (阿史那庫頭) - Ditou Qaghan (appointed by Muqan Qaghan to be lesser khagan of eastern wing of Turkic Empire)
* Mahan Tigin - Lesser khagan appointed by Taspar Qaghan
* Rudan Qaghan (褥但可汗)
** Böri Qaghan (步離可汗) - Lesser khagan of appointed by Taspar Qaghan

== Legacy ==
He was succeeded by his younger brother Istemi in the western part and by his son Issik Qaghan in the eastern part. In less than one century, his khaganate expanded to comprise most of Central Asia.

<text>Bilge Qaghan (; ; 683 – 25 November 734) was the fourth Qaghan of the Second Turkic Khaganate. His accomplishments were described in the Orkhon inscriptions. 

==Names==
As was the custom, his personal name and the name after assuming the title Qaghan were different. His personal name was recorded in Chinese characters as (). His name after assuming the title was &quot;Bilgä Qaγan&quot;. ).

== Early years ==
He was born in 683, in the early years of the khaganate. He campaigned alongside his father from early childhood. He was created as Tardush shad and given command over the western wing of the empire in 697 by Qapaghan. He managed to annihilate Wei Yuanzhong&#x27;s army in 701 with his brother. He also reconquered Basmyl tribes in 703. He also subdued Yenisei Kyrgyz forces in 709, after their disobedience had to reconquer and kill their Qaghan in 710. He killed Türgesh khagan Suoge at Battle of Bolchu.

In later years of Qapaghan, he had to fight four battles in a year starting from 714, resubduing tribes and nearly was killed in an ambush from Uyghur forces in 716.

==Reign==

In 716, Qapaghan Qaghan, the second Qaghan, was killed in his campaign against the Toquz Oghuz alliance and his severed head was sent to Chang&#x27;an. Although his son Inel Khagan succeeded him, Bilgä&#x27;s brother Kul Tigin and Tonyukuk carried out a coup d&#x27;état against Inel Qaghan. They killed him and made him &quot;Bilgä&quot; &quot;Qaghan&quot;. His name literally means &quot;wise king&quot;.

He appointed his brother Kul Tigin to be Left Wise Prince, which made second most powerful person in realm. He re-subdued Huige in 716. He also appointed his father-in-law Tonyukuk to be Master Strategist.

New reforms and stabilization of the regime, caused tribes that fled Tujue to come back. Tang chancellor Wang Jun, believing that the Göktürks who surrendered would try to flee back to the Göktürk state, suggested that they be forcibly moved into the heart of the empire to prevent them from doing so. Before Wang&#x27;s suggestion could be acted upon, however, there was an uprising by the Göktürks who surrendered, under the leadership of Xiedie Sitai (𨁂跌思泰) and Axilan (阿悉爛). Xue and Wang tried to intercept them and dealt them defeats, but they were able to flee back to the Göktürk state anyway. This defeat led to Xue Ne&#x27;s retirement.

== Religious policy ==
At some point in his life, he thought about converting to Buddhism and settling in cities. However, Tonyukuk discouraged him from this, citing the Turks&#x27; few numbers and vulnerability to Chinese attacks. While the Turks&#x27; power rested on their mobility, conversion to Buddhism would bring pacifism among the population. Therefore, sticking to Tengrism was necessary for survival.

== Later reign ==

In 720, Wang believed that the Pugu (僕固) and Xiedie tribes of the region were planning to defect to Eastern Tujue and attack with Eastern Tujue troops. He thus held a feast and invited the chieftains, and, at the feast, massacred them. He then attacked the Pugu and Xiedie tribes in the area, nearly wiping them out. He then proposed a plan to attack Qaghan along with the Baximi, Xi, and Khitan. Emperor Xuanzong also recruited Qapaghan Khagan&#x27;s sons Bilgä Tigin and Mo Tigin, Yenisei Kyrgyz Qaghan Kutluk Bilgä Qaghan and Huoba Guiren to fight against Tujue. Tonyukuk cunningly launched first attack on Baximi in 721 autumn, completely crushing them. Meanwhile, Bilgä raided Gansu, taking much of the livestock. Later that year Khitans, next year Xi were also crushed.

In 726, his father-in-law and chancellor Tonyukuk died.

In 727, he sent Buyruk Chor () as an emissary to Xuanzong with 30 horses as a gift. He also warned him of Me Agtsom&#x27;s proposal of an anti-Tang alliance. This alarm proved to be true when Tibetan general We Tadra Khonglo invaded Tang China in 727, sacked Guazhou (瓜州, in modern Gansu), Changle (常樂, in south of modern Guazhou County), Changmenjun (長門軍, in north of modern Yumen) and Anxi (安西, modern Lintan).

On 27 February 731, Kul Tigin died, for which Qaghan mourned and ordered a great funeral ceremony.

In 733, he defeated rebellious Khitan tribes.

== Death ==
Just after sending an emissary to Xuanzong to gain heqin alliance, he was poisoned by Buyruk Chor. He did not die immediately and he had time to punish the family of Buyruk Chor with death. He died on 25 November 734, his burial ceremony took place on 22 June 735.

== Family ==
He was married to El Etmish Bilge Khatun, Tonyukuk&#x27;s daughter. He had several children:

* Ashina Yiran (阿史那伊然)
* Ashina Kutluk (阿史那骨咄)
* 2 unnamed sons who both became puppet Qaghans under Kutluk Yabgu Khagan
* A daughter who was married to Suluk
* Po Beg - submitted to Tang after 744.

== Legacy ==
After his death from poisoning, several steles were erected in the capital area by the Orkhon River. These Orkhon inscriptions are the first known texts in the Old Turkic language.

== In popular culture ==
* Bilge Qaghan is portrayed by Kang Jae-ik in the 2006-2007 KBS TV series &quot;Dae Jo-yeong&quot;.

<text>The Staatliches Bauhaus (), commonly known as the , was a German art school operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts. The school became famous for its approach to design, which attempted to unify individual artistic vision with the principles of mass production and emphasis on function.

The Bauhaus was founded by architect Walter Gropius in Weimar. It was grounded in the idea of creating a &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; (&quot;comprehensive artwork&quot;) in which all the arts would eventually be brought together. The Bauhaus style later became one of the most influential currents in modern design, modernist architecture, and architectural education. The Bauhaus movement had a profound influence on subsequent developments in art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, industrial design, and typography. Staff at the Bauhaus included prominent artists such as Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, Gunta Stölzl, and László Moholy-Nagy at various points.
The school existed in three German cities—Weimar, from 1919 to 1925; Dessau, from 1925 to 1932; and Berlin, from 1932 to 1933—under three different architect-directors: Walter Gropius from 1919 to 1928; Hannes Meyer from 1928 to 1930; and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe from 1930 until 1933, when the school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the Nazi regime, having been painted as a centre of communist intellectualism. Internationally, former key figures of Bauhaus were successful in the United States and became known as the &quot;avant-garde&quot; for the International Style. The White city of Tel Aviv to which numerous Jewish Bauhaus architects emigrated, has the highest concentration of the Bauhaus&#x27; international architecture in the world.

The changes of venue and leadership resulted in a constant shifting of focus, technique, instructors, and politics. For example, the pottery shop was discontinued when the school moved from Weimar to Dessau, even though it had been an important revenue source; when Mies van der Rohe took over the school in 1930, he transformed it into a private school and would not allow any supporters of Hannes Meyer to attend it.

== Terms and Concepts ==
Several specific features are identified in the Bauhaus forms and shapes: simple geometric shapes like rectangles and spheres, without elaborate decorations. Buildings, furniture, and fonts often feature rounded corners, sometimes rounded walls, or curved chrome pipes. Some buildings are characterized by rectangular features, for example protruding balconies with flat, chunky railings facing the street, and long banks of windows. Some outlines can be defined as a tool for creating an ideal form, which is the basis of the architectural concept.

== Bauhaus and German modernism ==
After Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I and the establishment of the Weimar Republic, a renewed liberal spirit allowed an upsurge of radical experimentation in all the arts, which had been suppressed by the old regime. Many Germans of left-wing views were influenced by the cultural experimentation that followed the Russian Revolution, such as constructivism. Such influences can be overstated: Gropius did not share these radical views, and said that Bauhaus was entirely apolitical. Just as important was the influence of the 19th-century English designer William Morris (1834–1896), who had argued that art should meet the needs of society and that there should be no distinction between form and function. Thus, the Bauhaus style, also known as the International Style, was marked by the absence of ornamentation and by harmony between the function of an object or a building and its design.

However, the most important influence on Bauhaus was modernism, a cultural movement whose origins lay as early as the 1880s, and which had already made its presence felt in Germany before the World War, despite the prevailing conservatism. The design innovations commonly associated with Gropius and the Bauhaus—the radically simplified forms, the rationality and functionality, and the idea that mass production was reconcilable with the individual artistic spirit—were already partly developed in Germany before the Bauhaus was founded. The German national designers&#x27; organization Deutscher Werkbund was formed in 1907 by Hermann Muthesius to harness the new potentials of mass production, with a mind towards preserving Germany&#x27;s economic competitiveness with England. In its first seven years, the Werkbund came to be regarded as the authoritative body on questions of design in Germany, and was copied in other countries. Many fundamental questions of craftsmanship versus mass production, the relationship of usefulness and beauty, the practical purpose of formal beauty in a commonplace object, and whether or not a single proper form could exist, were argued out among its 1,870 members (by 1914).

German architectural modernism was known as Neues Bauen. Beginning in June 1907, Peter Behrens&#x27; pioneering industrial design work for the German electrical company AEG successfully integrated art and mass production on a large scale. He designed consumer products, standardized parts, created clean-lined designs for the company&#x27;s graphics, developed a consistent corporate identity, built the modernist landmark AEG Turbine Factory, and made full use of newly developed materials such as poured concrete and exposed steel. Behrens was a founding member of the Werkbund, and both Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer worked for him in this period.

The Bauhaus was founded at a time when the German zeitgeist had turned from emotional Expressionism to the matter-of-fact New Objectivity. An entire group of working architects, including Erich Mendelsohn, Bruno Taut and Hans Poelzig, turned away from fanciful experimentation and towards rational, functional, sometimes standardized building. Beyond the Bauhaus, many other significant German-speaking architects in the 1920s responded to the same aesthetic issues and material possibilities as the school. They also responded to the promise &quot;to promote the object of assuring to every German a healthful habitation&quot; written into the new Weimar Constitution (Article 155). Ernst May, Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner, among others, built large housing blocks in Frankfurt and Berlin. The acceptance of modernist design into everyday life was the subject of publicity campaigns, well-attended public exhibitions like the Weissenhof Estate, films, and sometimes fierce public debate.

=== Bauhaus and Vkhutemas ===

The Vkhutemas, the Russian state art and technical school founded in 1920 in Moscow, has been compared to Bauhaus. Founded a year after the Bauhaus school, Vkhutemas has close parallels to the German Bauhaus in its intent, organization and scope. The two schools were the first to train artist-designers in a modern manner. Both schools were state-sponsored initiatives to merge traditional craft with modern technology, with a basic course in aesthetic principles, courses in color theory, industrial design, and architecture. Vkhutemas was a larger school than the Bauhaus, but it was less publicised outside the Soviet Union and consequently, is less familiar in the West.

With the internationalism of modern architecture and design, there were many exchanges between the Vkhutemas and the Bauhaus. The second Bauhaus director Hannes Meyer attempted to organise an exchange between the two schools, while Hinnerk Scheper of the Bauhaus collaborated with various Vkhutein members on the use of colour in architecture. In addition, El Lissitzky&#x27;s book &quot;Russia: an Architecture for World Revolution&quot; published in German in 1930 featured several illustrations of Vkhutemas/Vkhutein projects there.

== History of the Bauhaus ==
=== Weimar ===
The school was founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar on 1 April 1919, as a merger of the Grand-Ducal Saxon Academy of Fine Art and the Grand Ducal Saxon School of Arts and Crafts for a newly affiliated architecture department. Its roots lay in the arts and crafts school founded by the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach in 1906, and directed by Belgian Art Nouveau architect Henry van de Velde. When van de Velde was forced to resign in 1915 because he was Belgian, he suggested Gropius, Hermann Obrist, and August Endell as possible successors. In 1919, after delays caused by World War I and a lengthy debate over who should head the institution and the socio-economic meanings of a reconciliation of the fine arts and the applied arts (an issue which remained a defining one throughout the school&#x27;s existence), Gropius was made the director of a new institution integrating the two called the Bauhaus. In the pamphlet for an April 1919 exhibition entitled &quot;Exhibition of Unknown Architects&quot;, Gropius, still very much under the influence of William Morris and the British Arts and Crafts Movement, proclaimed his goal as being &quot;to create a new guild of craftsmen, without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist.&quot; Gropius&#x27;s neologism &quot;Bauhaus&quot; references both building and the Bauhütte, a premodern guild of stonemasons. The early intention was for the Bauhaus to be a combined architecture school, crafts school, and academy of the arts. Swiss painter Johannes Itten, German-American painter Lyonel Feininger, and German sculptor Gerhard Marcks, along with Gropius, comprised the faculty of the Bauhaus in 1919. By the following year their ranks had grown to include German painter, sculptor, and designer Oskar Schlemmer who headed the theatre workshop, and Swiss painter Paul Klee, joined in 1922 by Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky. The first major joint project completed by the Bauhaus was the Sommerfeld House, which was built between 1920 and 1921. A tumultuous year at the Bauhaus, 1922 also saw the move of Dutch painter Theo van Doesburg to Weimar to promote &quot;De Stijl&quot; (&quot;The Style&quot;), and a visit to the Bauhaus by Russian Constructivist artist and architect El Lissitzky.

From 1919 to 1922 the school was shaped by the pedagogical and aesthetic ideas of Johannes Itten, who taught the &quot;Vorkurs&quot; or &quot;preliminary course&quot; that was the introduction to the ideas of the Bauhaus. Itten was heavily influenced in his teaching by the ideas of Franz Cižek and Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel. He was also influenced in respect to aesthetics by the work of the Der Blaue Reiter group in Munich, as well as the work of Austrian Expressionist Oskar Kokoschka. The influence of German Expressionism favoured by Itten was analogous in some ways to the fine arts side of the ongoing debate. This influence culminated with the addition of Der Blaue Reiter founding member Wassily Kandinsky to the faculty and ended when Itten resigned in late 1923. Itten was replaced by the Hungarian designer László Moholy-Nagy, who rewrote the &quot;Vorkurs&quot; with a leaning towards the New Objectivity favoured by Gropius, which was analogous in some ways to the applied arts side of the debate. Although this shift was an important one, it did not represent a radical break from the past so much as a small step in a broader, more gradual socio-economic movement that had been going on at least since 1907, when van de Velde had argued for a craft basis for design while Hermann Muthesius had begun implementing industrial prototypes.

Gropius was not necessarily against Expressionism, and in the same 1919 pamphlet proclaiming this &quot;new guild of craftsmen, without the class snobbery&quot;, described &quot;painting and sculpture rising to heaven out of the hands of a million craftsmen, the crystal symbol of the new faith of the future.&quot; By 1923, however, Gropius was no longer evoking images of soaring Romanesque cathedrals and the craft-driven aesthetic of the &quot;Völkisch movement&quot;, instead declaring &quot;we want an architecture adapted to our world of machines, radios and fast cars.&quot; Gropius argued that a new period of history had begun with the end of the war. He wanted to create a new architectural style to reflect this new era. His style in architecture and consumer goods was to be functional, cheap and consistent with mass production. To these ends, Gropius wanted to reunite art and craft to arrive at high-end functional products with artistic merit. The Bauhaus issued a magazine called &quot;Bauhaus&quot; and a series of books called &quot;Bauhausbücher&quot;. Since the Weimar Republic lacked the number of raw materials available to the United States and Great Britain, it had to rely on the proficiency of a skilled labour force and an ability to export innovative and high-quality goods. Therefore, designers were needed and so was a new type of art education. The school&#x27;s philosophy stated that the artist should be trained to work with the industry.

Weimar was in the German state of Thuringia, and the Bauhaus school received state support from the Social Democrat-controlled Thuringian state government. The school in Weimar experienced political pressure from conservative circles in Thuringian politics, increasingly so after 1923 as political tension rose. One condition placed on the Bauhaus in this new political environment was the exhibition of work undertaken at the school. This condition was met in 1923 with the Bauhaus&#x27; exhibition of the experimental Haus am Horn. The Ministry of Education placed the staff on six-month contracts and cut the school&#x27;s funding in half. The Bauhaus issued a press release on 26 December 1924, setting the closure of the school for the end of March 1925. At this point it had already been looking for alternative sources of funding. After the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, a school of industrial design with teachers and staff less antagonistic to the conservative political regime remained in Weimar. This school was eventually known as the Technical University of Architecture and Civil Engineering, and in 1996 changed its name to Bauhaus-University Weimar.

=== Dessau ===

The Bauhaus moved to Dessau in 1925 and new facilities there were inaugurated in late 1926. Gropius&#x27;s design for the Dessau facilities was a return to the futuristic Gropius of 1914 that had more in common with the International style lines of the Fagus Factory than the stripped down Neo-classical of the Werkbund pavilion or the &quot;Völkisch&quot; Sommerfeld House. During the Dessau years, there was a remarkable change in direction for the school. According to Elaine Hoffman, Gropius had approached the Dutch architect Mart Stam to run the newly founded architecture program, and when Stam declined the position, Gropius turned to Stam&#x27;s friend and colleague in the ABC group, Hannes Meyer.

Meyer became director when Gropius resigned in February 1928, and brought the Bauhaus its two most significant building commissions, both of which still exist: five apartment buildings in the city of Dessau, and the Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes (ADGB Trade Union School) in Bernau bei Berlin. Meyer favoured measurements and calculations in his presentations to clients, along with the use of off-the-shelf architectural components to reduce costs. This approach proved attractive to potential clients. The school turned its first profit under his leadership in 1929.

But Meyer also generated a great deal of conflict. As a radical functionalist, he had no patience with the aesthetic program and forced the resignations of Herbert Bayer, Marcel Breuer, and other long-time instructors. Even though Meyer shifted the orientation of the school further to the left than it had been under Gropius, he didn&#x27;t want the school to become a tool of left-wing party politics. He prevented the formation of a student communist cell, and in the increasingly dangerous political atmosphere, this became a threat to the existence of the Dessau school. Dessau mayor Fritz Hesse fired him in the summer of 1930. The Dessau city council attempted to convince Gropius to return as head of the school, but Gropius instead suggested Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Mies was appointed in 1930 and immediately interviewed each student, dismissing those that he deemed uncommitted. He halted the school&#x27;s manufacture of goods so that the school could focus on teaching, and appointed no new faculty other than his close confidant Lilly Reich. By 1931, the Nazi Party was becoming more influential in German politics. When it gained control of the Dessau city council, it moved to close the school.
=== Berlin ===
In late 1932, Mies rented a derelict factory in Berlin (Birkbusch Street 49) to use as the new Bauhaus with his own money. The students and faculty rehabilitated the building, painting the interior white. The school operated for ten months without further interference from the Nazi Party. In 1933, the Gestapo closed down the Berlin school. Mies protested the decision, eventually speaking to the head of the Gestapo, who agreed to allow the school to re-open. However, shortly after receiving a letter permitting the opening of the Bauhaus, Mies and the other faculty agreed to voluntarily shut down the school.

Although neither the Nazi Party nor Adolf Hitler had a cohesive architectural policy before they came to power in 1933, Nazi writers like Wilhelm Frick and Alfred Rosenberg had already labelled the Bauhaus &quot;un-German&quot; and criticized its modernist styles, deliberately generating public controversy over issues like flat roofs. Increasingly through the early 1930s, they characterized the Bauhaus as a front for communists and social liberals. Indeed, when Meyer was fired in 1930, a number of communist students loyal to him moved to the Soviet Union.

Even before the Nazis came to power, political pressure on Bauhaus had increased. The Nazi movement, from nearly the start, denounced the Bauhaus for its &quot;degenerate art&quot;, and the Nazi regime was determined to crack down on what it saw as the foreign, probably Jewish, influences of &quot;cosmopolitan modernism&quot;. Despite Gropius&#x27;s protestations that as a war veteran and a patriot his work had no subversive political intent, the Berlin Bauhaus was pressured to close in April 1933. Emigrants did succeed, however, in spreading the concepts of the Bauhaus to other countries, including the &quot;New Bauhaus&quot; of Chicago: Mies decided to emigrate to the United States for the directorship of the School of Architecture at the Armour Institute (now Illinois Institute of Technology) in Chicago and to seek building commissions. The simple engineering-oriented functionalism of stripped-down modernism, however, did lead to some Bauhaus influences living on in Nazi Germany. When Hitler&#x27;s chief engineer, Fritz Todt, began opening the new autobahns (highways) in 1935, many of the bridges and service stations were &quot;bold examples of modernism&quot;, and among those submitting designs was Mies van der Rohe.

== Architectural output ==
The paradox of the early Bauhaus was that, although its manifesto proclaimed that the aim of all creative activity was building, the school did not offer classes in architecture until 1927. During the years under Gropius (1919–1927), he and his partner Adolf Meyer observed no real distinction between the output of his architectural office and the school. The built output of Bauhaus architecture in these years is the output of Gropius: the Sommerfeld house in Berlin, the Otte house in Berlin, the Auerbach house in Jena, and the competition design for the Chicago Tribune Tower, which brought the school much attention. The definitive 1926 Bauhaus building in Dessau is also attributed to Gropius. Apart from contributions to the 1923 Haus am Horn, student architectural work amounted to un-built projects, interior finishes, and craft work like cabinets, chairs and pottery.

In the next two years under Meyer, the architectural focus shifted away from aesthetics and towards functionality. There were major commissions: one from the city of Dessau for five tightly designed &quot;Laubenganghäuser&quot; (apartment buildings with balcony access), which are still in use today, and another for the Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes (ADGB Trade Union School) in Bernau bei Berlin. Meyer&#x27;s approach was to research users&#x27; needs and scientifically develop the design solution. He intended to place emphasis on Gropius&#x27; objective analysis of the properties determining an object&#x27;s use value, known as &quot;Wesensforschung&quot;. Gropius believed that it was possible to design exemplary products of universal validity that should be standardized.

Mies van der Rohe repudiated Meyer&#x27;s politics, his supporters, and his architectural approach. As opposed to Gropius&#x27;s &quot;study of essentials&quot;, and Meyer&#x27;s research into user requirements, Mies advocated a &quot;spatial implementation of intellectual decisions&quot;, which effectively meant an adoption of his own aesthetics. Neither Mies van der Rohe nor his Bauhaus students saw any projects built during the 1930s.

The Bauhaus movement was not focused on developing worker housing. Only two projects, the apartment building project in Dessau and the Törten row housing fall into the worker housing category. It was the Bauhaus contemporaries Bruno Taut, Hans Poelzig and particularly Ernst May, as the city architects of Berlin, Dresden and Frankfurt respectively, who are rightfully credited with the thousands of socially progressive housing units built in Weimar Germany. The housing Taut built in south-west Berlin during the 1920s, close to the U-Bahn stop Onkel Toms Hütte, is still occupied.

== Impact ==

The Bauhaus had a major impact on art and architecture trends in Western Europe, Canada, the United States and Israel in the decades following its demise, as many of the artists involved fled, or were exiled by the Nazi regime. In 1996, four of the major sites associated with Bauhaus in Germany were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List (with two more added in 2017).

In 1928, the Hungarian painter Alexander Bortnyik founded a school of design in Budapest called Műhely, which means &quot;the studio&quot;. Located on the seventh floor of a house on Nagymezo Street, it was meant to be the Hungarian equivalent to the Bauhaus. The literature sometimes refers to it—in an oversimplified manner—as &quot;the Budapest Bauhaus&quot;. Bortnyik was a great admirer of László Moholy-Nagy and had met Walter Gropius in Weimar between 1923 and 1925. Moholy-Nagy himself taught at the Műhely. Victor Vasarely, a pioneer of op art, studied at this school before establishing in Paris in 1930.
Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, and Moholy-Nagy re-assembled in Britain during the mid-1930s and lived and worked in the Isokon housing development in Lawn Road in London before the war caught up with them. Gropius and Breuer went on to teach at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and worked together before their professional split. Their collaboration produced, among other projects, the Aluminum City Terrace in New Kensington, Pennsylvania and the Alan I W Frank House in Pittsburgh. The Harvard School was enormously influential in America in the late 1920s and early 1930s, producing such students as Philip Johnson, I. M. Pei, Lawrence Halprin and Paul Rudolph, among many others.

In the late 1930s, Mies van der Rohe re-settled in Chicago, enjoyed the sponsorship of the influential Philip Johnson, and became one of the world&#x27;s pre-eminent architects. Moholy-Nagy also went to Chicago and founded the New Bauhaus school under the sponsorship of industrialist and philanthropist Walter Paepcke. This school became the Institute of Design, part of the Illinois Institute of Technology. Printmaker and painter Werner Drewes was also largely responsible for bringing the Bauhaus aesthetic to America and taught at both Columbia University and Washington University in St. Louis. Herbert Bayer, sponsored by Paepcke, moved to Aspen, Colorado in support of Paepcke&#x27;s Aspen projects at the Aspen Institute. In 1953, Max Bill, together with Inge Aicher-Scholl and Otl Aicher, founded the Ulm School of Design (German: Hochschule für Gestaltung – HfG Ulm) in Ulm, Germany, a design school in the tradition of the Bauhaus. The school is notable for its inclusion of semiotics as a field of study. The school closed in 1968, but the &quot;Ulm Model&quot; concept continues to influence international design education. Another series of projects at the school were the Bauhaus typefaces, mostly realized in the decades afterward.

The influence of the Bauhaus on design education was significant. One of the main objectives of the Bauhaus was to unify art, craft, and technology, and this approach was incorporated into the curriculum of the Bauhaus. The structure of the Bauhaus &quot;Vorkurs&quot; (preliminary course) reflected a pragmatic approach to integrating theory and application. In their first year, students learnt the basic elements and principles of design and colour theory, and experimented with a range of materials and processes. This approach to design education became a common feature of architectural and design school in many countries. For example, the Shillito Design School in Sydney stands as a unique link between Australia and the Bauhaus. The colour and design syllabus of the Shillito Design School was firmly underpinned by the theories and ideologies of the Bauhaus. Its first year foundational course mimicked the &quot;Vorkurs&quot; and focused on the elements and principles of design plus colour theory and application. The founder of the school, Phyllis Shillito, which opened in 1962 and closed in 1980, firmly believed that &quot;A student who has mastered the basic principles of design, can design anything from a dress to a kitchen stove&quot;. In Britain, largely under the influence of painter and teacher William Johnstone, Basic Design, a Bauhaus-influenced art foundation course, was introduced at Camberwell School of Art and the Central School of Art and Design, whence it spread to all art schools in the country, becoming universal by the early 1960s.

One of the most important contributions of the Bauhaus is in the field of modern furniture design. The characteristic Cantilever chair and Wassily Chair designed by Marcel Breuer are two examples. (Breuer eventually lost a legal battle in Germany with Dutch architect/designer Mart Stam over patent rights to the cantilever chair design. Although Stam had worked on the design of the Bauhaus&#x27;s 1923 exhibit in Weimar, and guest-lectured at the Bauhaus later in the 1920s, he was not formally associated with the school, and he and Breuer had worked independently on the cantilever concept, leading to the patent dispute.) The most profitable product of the Bauhaus was its wallpaper.

The physical plant at Dessau survived World War II and was operated as a design school with some architectural facilities by the German Democratic Republic. This included live stage productions in the Bauhaus theater under the name of &quot;Bauhausbühne&quot; (&quot;Bauhaus Stage&quot;). After German reunification, a reorganized school continued in the same building, with no essential continuity with the Bauhaus under Gropius in the early 1920s. In 1979 Bauhaus-Dessau College started to organize postgraduate programs with participants from all over the world. This effort has been supported by the Bauhaus-Dessau Foundation which was founded in 1974 as a public institution.

Later evaluation of the Bauhaus design credo was critical of its flawed recognition of the human element, an acknowledgment of &quot;the dated, unattractive aspects of the Bauhaus as a projection of utopia marked by mechanistic views of human nature…Home hygiene without home atmosphere.&quot;

Subsequent examples which have continued the philosophy of the Bauhaus include Black Mountain College, Hochschule für Gestaltung in Ulm and Domaine de Boisbuchet.
=== The White City ===

The White City (Hebrew: העיר הלבנה), refers to a collection of over 4,000 buildings built in the Bauhaus or International Style in Tel Aviv from the 1930s by German Jewish architects who emigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine after the rise of the Nazis. Tel Aviv has the largest number of buildings in the Bauhaus/International Style of any city in the world. Preservation, documentation, and exhibitions have brought attention to Tel Aviv&#x27;s collection of 1930s architecture. In 2003, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) proclaimed Tel Aviv&#x27;s &quot;White City&quot; a World Cultural Heritage site, as &quot;an outstanding example of new town planning and architecture in the early 20th century.&quot; The citation recognized the unique adaptation of modern international architectural trends to the cultural, climatic, and local traditions of the city. Bauhaus Center Tel Aviv organizes regular architectural tours of the city, and the Bauhaus Foundation offers Bauhaus exhibits.

===Centenary===
As the centenary of the founding of Bauhaus, several events, festivals, and exhibitions were held around the world in 2019. The international opening festival at the Berlin Academy of the Arts from 16 to 24 January concentrated on &quot;the presentation and production of pieces by contemporary artists, in which the aesthetic issues and experimental configurations of the Bauhaus artists continue to be inspiringly contagious&quot;. &quot;Original Bauhaus, The Centenary Exhibition&quot; at the Berlinische Galerie (6 September 2019 to 27 January 2020) presented 1,000 original artefacts from the Bauhaus-Archive&#x27;s collection and recounted the history behind the objects. The Bauhaus Museum Dessau also opened in September 2019, operated by the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation and funded by the State of Saxony-Anhalt and the German Federal government. It is set to be the permanent home of the second largest Bauhaus collection at 49,000 objects, while paying homage to its strong influence in the city when Bauhaus arrived in 1925. 

In 2024, the German far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfG) sought to attack celebrations of Bauhaus because of their view that Bauhaus did not follow tradition. Bauhaus was also crushed by the Nazi&#x27;s before World War II, and according to political scientist Jan-Werner Mueller, AfG&#x27;s condemnation seeks to use it in a culture war of far right-wing provocation.

===The New European Bauhaus===

In September 2020, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen introduced the New European Bauhaus (NEB) initiative during her State of the Union address. The NEB is a creative and interdisciplinary movement that connects the European Green Deal to everyday life. It is a platform for experimentation aiming to unite citizens, experts, businesses and institutions in imagining and designing a sustainable, aesthetic and inclusive future.

Sport and physical activity were an essential part of the original Bauhaus approach. Hannes Meyer, the second director of Bauhaus Dessau, ensured that one day a week was solely devoted to sport and gymnastics. 1 In 1930, Meyer employed two physical education teachers. The Bauhaus school even applied for public funds to enhance its playing field. The inclusion of sport and physical activity in the Bauhaus curriculum had various purposes. First, as Meyer put it, sport combatted a “one-sided emphasis on brainwork.” In addition, Bauhaus instructors believed that students could better express themselves if they actively experienced the space, rhythms and movements of the body. The Bauhaus approach also considered physical activity an important contributor to wellbeing and community spirit. Sport and physical activity were essential to the interdisciplinary Bauhaus movement that developed revolutionary ideas and continues to shape our environments today.

<doc id="3833" wikidata="Q48328" url="?curid=3833" title="Beowulf">
<text>Beowulf (; ) is an Old English epic poem in the tradition of Germanic heroic legend consisting of 3,182 alliterative lines. It is one of the most important and most often translated works of Old English literature. The date of composition is a matter of contention among scholars; the only certain dating is for the manuscript, which was produced between 975 and 1025 AD. Scholars call the anonymous author the &quot;&quot;Beowulf&quot; poet&quot;. 
The story is set in pagan Scandinavia in the 5th and 6th centuries. Beowulf, a hero of the Geats, comes to the aid of Hrothgar, the king of the Danes, whose mead hall Heorot has been under attack by the monster Grendel for twelve years. After Beowulf slays him, Grendel&#x27;s mother takes revenge and is in turn defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to Geatland and becomes king of the Geats. Fifty years later, Beowulf defeats a dragon, but is mortally wounded in the battle. After his death, his attendants cremate his body and erect a barrow on a headland in his memory.

Scholars have debated whether &quot;Beowulf&quot; was transmitted orally, affecting its interpretation: if it was composed early, in pagan times, then the paganism is central and the Christian elements were added later, whereas if it was composed later, in writing, by a Christian, then the pagan elements could be decorative archaising; some scholars also hold an intermediate position. 
&quot;Beowulf&quot; is written mostly in the Late West Saxon dialect of Old English, but many other dialectal forms are present, suggesting that the poem may have had a long and complex transmission throughout the dialect areas of England.

There has long been research into similarities with other traditions and accounts, including the Icelandic &quot;Grettis saga&quot;, the Norse story of Hrolf Kraki and his bear-shapeshifting servant Bodvar Bjarki, the international folktale the Bear&#x27;s Son Tale, and the Irish folktale of the Hand and the Child. Persistent attempts have been made to link &quot;Beowulf&quot; to tales from Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; or Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. More definite are biblical parallels, with clear allusions to the books of Genesis, Exodus, and Daniel.

The poem survives in a single copy in the manuscript known as the Nowell Codex. It has no title in the original manuscript, but has become known by the name of the story&#x27;s protagonist. In 1731, the manuscript was damaged by a fire that swept through Ashburnham House in London, which was housing Sir Robert Cotton&#x27;s collection of medieval manuscripts. It survived, but the margins were charred, and some readings were lost. The Nowell Codex is housed in the British Library. 
The poem was first transcribed in 1786; some verses were first translated into modern English in 1805, and nine complete translations were made in the 19th century, including those by John Mitchell Kemble and William Morris.
After 1900, hundreds of translations, whether into prose, rhyming verse, or alliterative verse were made, some relatively faithful, some archaising, some attempting to domesticate the work. Among the best-known modern translations are those of Edwin Morgan, Burton Raffel, Michael J. Alexander, Roy Liuzza, and Seamus Heaney. The difficulty of translating &quot;Beowulf&quot; has been explored by scholars including J. R. R. Tolkien (in his essay &quot;On Translating &quot;Beowulf&quot;), who worked on a verse and of his own.

== Historical background ==

The events in the poem take place over the 5th and 6th centuries, and feature predominantly non-English characters. Some suggest that &quot;Beowulf&quot; was first composed in the 7th century at Rendlesham in East Anglia, as the Sutton Hoo ship-burial shows close connections with Scandinavia, and the East Anglian royal dynasty, the Wuffingas, may have been descendants of the Geatish Wulfings. Others have associated this poem with the court of King Alfred the Great or with the court of King Cnut the Great.

The poem blends fictional, legendary, mythic and historical elements. Although Beowulf himself is not mentioned in any other Old English manuscript, many of the other figures named in &quot;Beowulf&quot; appear in Scandinavian sources. This concerns not only individuals (e.g., Healfdene, Hroðgar, Halga, Hroðulf, Eadgils and Ohthere), but also clans (e.g., Scyldings, Scylfings and Wulfings) and certain events (e.g., the battle between Eadgils and Onela). The raid by King Hygelac into Frisia is mentioned by Gregory of Tours in his &quot;History of the Franks&quot; and can be dated to around 521.

The majority view appears to be that figures such as King Hrothgar and the Scyldings in &quot;Beowulf&quot; are based on historical people from 6th-century Scandinavia. Like the &quot;Finnesburg Fragment&quot; and several shorter surviving poems, &quot;Beowulf&quot; has consequently been used as a source of information about Scandinavian figures such as Eadgils and Hygelac, and about continental Germanic figures such as Offa, king of the continental Angles. However, one scholar, Roy Liuzza, feels that the poem is &quot;frustratingly ambivalent&quot;, neither myth nor folktale, but is set &quot;against a complex background of legendary history ... on a roughly recognizable map of Scandinavia&quot;, and comments that the Geats of the poem may correspond with the Gautar (of modern Götaland).

Nineteenth-century archaeological evidence may confirm elements of the &quot;Beowulf&quot; story. Eadgils was buried at Uppsala (Gamla Uppsala, Sweden) according to Snorri Sturluson. When the western mound (to the left in the photo) was excavated in 1874, the finds showed that a powerful man was buried in a large barrow, , on a bear skin with two dogs and rich grave offerings. The eastern mound was excavated in 1854, and contained the remains of a woman, or a woman and a young man. The middle barrow has not been excavated.

In Denmark, recent (1986–88, 2004–05) archaeological excavations at Lejre, where Scandinavian tradition located the seat of the Scyldings, Heorot, have revealed that a hall was built in the mid-6th century, matching the period described in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, some centuries before the poem was composed. Three halls, each about long, were found during the excavation.

== Summary ==

The protagonist Beowulf, a hero of the Geats, comes to the aid of Hrothgar, king of the Danes, whose great hall, Heorot, is plagued by the monster Grendel. Beowulf kills Grendel with his bare hands, then kills Grendel&#x27;s mother with a giant&#x27;s sword that he found in her lair.

Later in his life, Beowulf becomes king of the Geats, and finds his realm terrorised by a dragon, some of whose treasure had been stolen from his hoard in a burial mound. He attacks the dragon with the help of his &quot;thegns&quot; or servants, but they do not succeed. Beowulf decides to follow the dragon to its lair at Earnanæs, but only his young Swedish relative Wiglaf, whose name means &quot;remnant of valour&quot;, dares to join him. Beowulf finally slays the dragon, but is mortally wounded in the struggle. He is cremated and a burial mound by the sea is erected in his honour.

&quot;Beowulf&quot; is considered an epic poem in that the main character is a hero who travels great distances to prove his strength at impossible odds against supernatural demons and beasts. The poem begins &quot;in medias res&quot; or simply, &quot;in the middle of things&quot;, a characteristic of the epics of antiquity. Although the poem begins with Beowulf&#x27;s arrival, Grendel&#x27;s attacks have been ongoing. An elaborate history of characters and their lineages is spoken of, as well as their interactions with each other, debts owed and repaid, and deeds of valour. The warriors form a brotherhood linked by loyalty to their lord. The poem begins and ends with funerals: at the beginning of the poem for Scyld Scefing and at the end for Beowulf.

The poem is tightly structured. E. Carrigan shows the symmetry of its design in a model of its major components, with for instance the account of the killing of Grendel matching that of the killing of the dragon, the glory of the Danes matching the accounts of the Danish and Geatish courts. Other analyses are possible as well; Gale Owen-Crocker, for instance, sees the poem as structured by the four funerals it describes. For J. R. R. Tolkien, the primary division in the poem was between young and old Beowulf.

=== First battle: Grendel ===

&quot;Beowulf&quot; begins with the story of Hrothgar, who constructed the great hall, Heorot, for himself and his warriors. In it, he, his wife Wealhtheow, and his warriors spend their time singing and celebrating. Grendel, a troll-like monster said to be descended from the biblical Cain, is pained by the sounds of joy. Grendel attacks the hall and devours many of Hrothgar&#x27;s warriors while they sleep. Hrothgar and his people, helpless against Grendel, abandon Heorot.

Beowulf, a young warrior from Geatland, hears of Hrothgar&#x27;s troubles and with his king&#x27;s permission leaves his homeland to assist Hrothgar.

Beowulf and his men spend the night in Heorot. Beowulf refuses to use any weapon because he holds himself to be Grendel&#x27;s equal. When Grendel enters the hall and kills one of Beowulf&#x27;s men, Beowulf, who has been feigning sleep, leaps up to clench Grendel&#x27;s hand. Grendel and Beowulf battle each other violently. Beowulf&#x27;s retainers draw their swords and rush to his aid, but their blades cannot pierce Grendel&#x27;s skin. Finally, Beowulf tears Grendel&#x27;s arm from his body at the shoulder. Fatally hurt, Grendel flees to his home in the marshes, where he dies. Beowulf displays &quot;the whole of Grendel&#x27;s shoulder and arm, his awesome grasp&quot; for all to see at Heorot. This display would fuel Grendel&#x27;s mother&#x27;s anger in revenge.

=== Second battle: Grendel&#x27;s mother ===

The next night, after celebrating Grendel&#x27;s defeat, Hrothgar and his men sleep in Heorot. Grendel&#x27;s mother, angry that her son has been killed, sets out to get revenge. &quot;Beowulf was elsewhere. Earlier, after the award of treasure, The Geat had been given another lodging&quot;; his assistance would be absent in this attack. Grendel&#x27;s mother violently kills Æschere, who is Hrothgar&#x27;s most loyal advisor, and escapes, later putting his head outside her lair.

Hrothgar, Beowulf, and their men track Grendel&#x27;s mother to her lair under a lake. Unferth, a warrior who had earlier challenged him, presents Beowulf with his sword Hrunting. After stipulating a number of conditions to Hrothgar in case of his death (including the taking in of his kinsmen and the inheritance by Unferth of Beowulf&#x27;s estate), Beowulf jumps into the lake and, while harassed by water monsters, gets to the bottom, where he finds a cavern. Grendel&#x27;s mother pulls him in, and she and Beowulf engage in fierce combat.

At first, Grendel&#x27;s mother prevails, and Hrunting proves incapable of hurting her; she throws Beowulf to the ground and, sitting astride him, tries to kill him with a short sword, but Beowulf is saved by his armour. Beowulf spots another sword, hanging on the wall and apparently made for giants, and cuts her head off with it. Travelling further into Grendel&#x27;s mother&#x27;s lair, Beowulf discovers Grendel&#x27;s corpse and severs his head with the sword. Its blade melts because of the monster&#x27;s &quot;hot blood&quot;, leaving only the hilt. Beowulf swims back up to the edge of the lake where his men wait. Carrying the hilt of the sword and Grendel&#x27;s head, he presents them to Hrothgar upon his return to Heorot. Hrothgar gives Beowulf many gifts, including the sword Nægling, his family&#x27;s heirloom. The events prompt a long reflection by the king, sometimes referred to as &quot;Hrothgar&#x27;s sermon&quot;, in which he urges Beowulf to be wary of pride and to reward his thegns.

=== Final battle: The dragon ===

Beowulf returns home and eventually becomes king of his own people. One day, fifty years after Beowulf&#x27;s battle with Grendel&#x27;s mother, a slave steals a golden cup from the lair of a dragon at Earnanæs. When the dragon sees that the cup has been stolen, it leaves its cave in a rage, burning everything in sight. Beowulf and his warriors come to fight the dragon, but Beowulf tells his men that he will fight the dragon alone and that they should wait on the barrow. Beowulf descends to do battle with the dragon, but finds himself outmatched. His men, upon seeing this and fearing for their lives, retreat into the woods. However, one of his men, Wiglaf, in great distress at Beowulf&#x27;s plight, comes to his aid. The two slay the dragon, but Beowulf is mortally wounded. After Beowulf dies, Wiglaf remains by his side, grief-stricken. When the rest of the men finally return, Wiglaf bitterly admonishes them, blaming their cowardice for Beowulf&#x27;s death. Beowulf is ritually burned on a great pyre in Geatland while his people wail and mourn him, fearing that without him, the Geats are defenceless against attacks from surrounding tribes. Afterwards, a barrow, visible from the sea, is built in his memory.

=== Digressions ===

The poem contains many apparent digressions from the main story. These were found troublesome by early &quot;Beowulf&quot; scholars such as Frederick Klaeber, who wrote that they &quot;interrupt the story&quot;, W. W. Lawrence, who stated that they &quot;clog the action and distract attention from it&quot;, and W. P. Ker who found some &quot;irrelevant ... possibly ... interpolations&quot;. More recent scholars from Adrien Bonjour onwards note that the digressions can all be explained as introductions or comparisons with elements of the main story; for instance, Beowulf&#x27;s swimming home across the sea from Frisia carrying thirty sets of armour emphasises his heroic strength. The digressions can be divided into four groups, namely the Scyld narrative at the start; many descriptions of the Geats, including the Swedish–Geatish wars, the &quot;Lay of the Last Survivor&quot; in the style of another Old English poem, &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, and Beowulf&#x27;s dealings with the Geats such as his verbal contest with Unferth and his swimming duel with Breca, and the tale of Sigemund and the dragon; history and legend, including the fight at Finnsburg and the tale of Freawaru and Ingeld; and biblical tales such as the creation myth and Cain as ancestor of all monsters. The digressions provide a powerful impression of historical depth, imitated by Tolkien in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, a work that embodies many other elements from the poem.

== Authorship and date ==

The dating of &quot;Beowulf&quot; has attracted considerable scholarly attention; opinion differs as to whether it was first written in the 8th century, whether it was nearly contemporary with its 11th-century manuscript, and whether a proto-version (possibly a version of the &quot;Bear&#x27;s Son Tale&quot;) was orally transmitted before being transcribed in its present form. Albert Lord felt strongly that the manuscript represents the transcription of a performance, though likely taken at more than one sitting. J. R. R. Tolkien believed that the poem retains too genuine a memory of Anglo-Saxon paganism to have been composed more than a few generations after the completion of the Christianisation of England around AD 700, and Tolkien&#x27;s conviction that the poem dates to the 8th century has been defended by scholars including Tom Shippey, Leonard Neidorf, Rafael J. Pascual, and Robert D. Fulk. An analysis of several Old English poems by a team including Neidorf suggests that &quot;Beowulf&quot; is the work of a single author, though other scholars disagree.

The claim to an early 11th-century date depends in part on scholars who argue that, rather than the transcription of a tale from the oral tradition by an earlier literate monk, &quot;Beowulf&quot; reflects an original interpretation of an earlier version of the story by the manuscript&#x27;s two scribes. On the other hand, some scholars argue that linguistic, palaeographical (handwriting), metrical (poetic structure), and onomastic (naming) considerations align to support a date of composition in the first half of the 8th century; in particular, the poem&#x27;s apparent observation of etymological vowel-length distinctions in unstressed syllables (described by Kaluza&#x27;s law) has been thought to demonstrate a date of composition prior to the earlier ninth century. However, scholars disagree about whether the metrical phenomena described by Kaluza&#x27;s law prove an early date of composition or are evidence of a longer prehistory of the &quot;Beowulf&quot; metre; B.R. Hutcheson, for instance, does not believe Kaluza&#x27;s law can be used to date the poem, while claiming that &quot;the weight of all the evidence Fulk presents in his book tells strongly in favour of an eighth-century date.&quot;

From an analysis of creative genealogy and ethnicity, Craig R. Davis suggests a composition date in the AD 890s, when King Alfred of England had secured the submission of Guthrum, leader of a division of the Great Heathen Army of the Danes, and of Aethelred, ealdorman of Mercia. In this thesis, the trend of appropriating Gothic royal ancestry, established in Francia during Charlemagne&#x27;s reign, influenced the Anglian kingdoms of Britain to attribute to themselves a Geatish descent. The composition of &quot;Beowulf&quot; was the fruit of the later adaptation of this trend in Alfred&#x27;s policy of asserting authority over the &quot;Angelcynn&quot;, in which Scyldic descent was attributed to the West-Saxon royal pedigree. This date of composition largely agrees with Lapidge&#x27;s positing of a West-Saxon exemplar .

The location of the poem&#x27;s composition is intensely disputed. In 1914, F.W. Moorman, the first professor of English Language at University of Leeds, claimed that &quot;Beowulf&quot; was composed in Yorkshire, but E. Talbot Donaldson claims that it was probably composed during the first half of the eighth century, and that the writer was a native of what was then called West Mercia, located in the Western Midlands of England. However, the late tenth-century manuscript, &quot;which alone preserves the poem&quot;, originated in the kingdom of the West Saxons — as it is more commonly known.

== Manuscript ==


&quot;Beowulf&quot; survived to modern times in a single manuscript, written in ink on parchment, later damaged by fire. The manuscript measures 245 × 185 mm.

=== Provenance ===

The poem is known only from a single manuscript, estimated to date from around 975–1025, in which it appears with other works. The manuscript therefore dates either to the reign of Æthelred the Unready, characterised by strife with the Danish king Sweyn Forkbeard, or to the beginning of the reign of Sweyn&#x27;s son Cnut the Great from 1016. The &quot;Beowulf&quot; manuscript is known as the Nowell Codex, gaining its name from 16th-century scholar Laurence Nowell. The official designation is &quot;British Library, Cotton Vitellius A.XV&quot; because it was one of Sir Robert Bruce Cotton&#x27;s holdings in the Cotton library in the middle of the 17th century. Many private antiquarians and book collectors, such as Sir Robert Cotton, used their own library classification systems. &quot;Cotton Vitellius A.XV&quot; translates as: the 15th book from the left on shelf A (the top shelf) of the bookcase with the bust of Roman Emperor Vitellius standing on top of it, in Cotton&#x27;s collection. Kevin Kiernan argues that Nowell most likely acquired it through William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, in 1563, when Nowell entered Cecil&#x27;s household as a tutor to his ward, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.

The earliest extant reference to the first foliation of the Nowell Codex was made sometime between 1628 and 1650 by Franciscus Junius (the younger). The ownership of the codex before Nowell remains a mystery.

The Reverend Thomas Smith (1638–1710) and Humfrey Wanley (1672–1726) both catalogued the Cotton library (in which the Nowell Codex was held). Smith&#x27;s catalogue appeared in 1696, and Wanley&#x27;s in 1705. The &quot;Beowulf&quot; manuscript itself is identified by name for the first time in an exchange of letters in 1700 between George Hickes, Wanley&#x27;s assistant, and Wanley. In the letter to Wanley, Hickes responds to an apparent charge against Smith, made by Wanley, that Smith had failed to mention the &quot;Beowulf&quot; script when cataloguing Cotton MS. Vitellius A. XV. Hickes replies to Wanley &quot;I can find nothing yet of Beowulph.&quot; Kiernan theorised that Smith failed to mention the &quot;Beowulf&quot; manuscript because of his reliance on previous catalogues or because either he had no idea how to describe it or because it was temporarily out of the codex.

The manuscript passed to Crown ownership in 1702, on the death of its then owner, Sir John Cotton, who had inherited it from his grandfather, Robert Cotton. It suffered damage in a fire at Ashburnham House in 1731, in which around a quarter of the manuscripts bequeathed by Cotton were destroyed. Since then, parts of the manuscript have crumbled along with many of the letters. Rebinding efforts, though saving the manuscript from much degeneration, have nonetheless covered up other letters of the poem, causing further loss. Kiernan, in preparing his electronic edition of the manuscript, used fibre-optic backlighting and ultraviolet lighting to reveal letters in the manuscript lost from binding, erasure, or ink blotting.

=== Writing ===

The &quot;Beowulf&quot; manuscript was transcribed from an original by two scribes, one of whom wrote the prose at the beginning of the manuscript and the first 1939 lines, before breaking off in mid-sentence. The first scribe made a point of carefully regularizing the spelling of the original document into the common West Saxon, removing any archaic or dialectical features. The second scribe, who wrote the remainder, with a difference in handwriting noticeable after line 1939, seems to have written more vigorously and with less interest. As a result, the second scribe&#x27;s script retains more archaic dialectic features, which allow modern scholars to ascribe the poem a cultural context. While both scribes appear to have proofread their work, there are nevertheless many errors. The second scribe was ultimately the more conservative copyist as he did not modify the spelling of the text as he wrote, but copied what he saw in front of him. In the way that it is currently bound, the &quot;Beowulf&quot; manuscript is followed by the Old English poem &quot;Judith&quot;. &quot;Judith&quot; was written by the same scribe that completed &quot;Beowulf&quot;, as evidenced by similar writing style. Wormholes found in the last leaves of the &quot;Beowulf&quot; manuscript that are absent in the &quot;Judith&quot; manuscript suggest that at one point &quot;Beowulf&quot; ended the volume. The rubbed appearance of some leaves suggests that the manuscript stood on a shelf unbound, as was the case with other Old English manuscripts. Knowledge of books held in the library at Malmesbury Abbey and available as source works, as well as the identification of certain words particular to the local dialect found in the text, suggest that the transcription may have taken place there.

=== Performance ===


The scholar Roy Liuzza notes that the practice of oral poetry is by its nature invisible to history as evidence is in writing. Comparison with other bodies of verse such as Homer&#x27;s, coupled with ethnographic observation of early 20th century performers, has provided a vision of how an Anglo-Saxon singer-poet or scop may have practised. The resulting model is that performance was based on traditional stories and a repertoire of word formulae that fitted the traditional metre. The scop moved through the scenes, such as putting on armour or crossing the sea, each one improvised at each telling with differing combinations of the stock phrases, while the basic story and style remained the same. Liuzza notes that &quot;Beowulf&quot; itself describes the technique of a court poet in assembling materials, in lines 867–874 in his translation, &quot;full of grand stories, mindful of songs ... found other words truly bound together; ... to recite with skill the adventure of Beowulf, adeptly tell a tall tale, and (&quot;wordum wrixlan&quot;) weave his words.&quot; The poem further mentions (lines 1065–1068) that &quot;the harp was touched, tales often told, when Hrothgar&#x27;s scop was set to recite among the mead tables his hall-entertainment&quot;.

=== Debate over oral tradition ===

The question of whether &quot;Beowulf&quot; was passed down through oral tradition prior to its present manuscript form has been the subject of much debate, and involves more than simply the issue of its composition. Rather, given the implications of the theory of oral-formulaic composition and oral tradition, the question concerns how the poem is to be understood, and what sorts of interpretations are legitimate. In his landmark 1960 work, &quot;The Singer of Tales&quot;, Albert Lord, citing the work of Francis Peabody Magoun and others, considered it proven that &quot;Beowulf&quot; was composed orally. Later scholars have not all been convinced; they agree that &quot;themes&quot; like &quot;arming the hero&quot; or the &quot;hero on the beach&quot; do exist across Germanic works. Some scholars conclude that Anglo-Saxon poetry is a mix of oral-formulaic and literate patterns. Larry Benson proposed that Germanic literature contains &quot;kernels of tradition&quot; which &quot;Beowulf&quot; expands upon. Ann Watts argued against the imperfect application of one theory to two different traditions: traditional, Homeric, oral-formulaic poetry and Anglo-Saxon poetry. Thomas Gardner agreed with Watts, arguing that the &quot;Beowulf&quot; text is too varied to be completely constructed from set formulae and themes. John Miles Foley wrote that comparative work must observe the particularities of a given tradition; in his view, there was a fluid continuum from traditionality to textuality.

== Editions, translations, and adaptations ==

=== Editions ===

Many editions of the Old English text of &quot;Beowulf&quot; have been published; this section lists the most influential.

The Icelandic scholar Grímur Jónsson Thorkelin made the first transcriptions of the &quot;Beowulf&quot;-manuscript in 1786, working as part of a Danish government historical research commission. He had a copy made by a professional copyist who knew no Old English (and was therefore in some ways more likely to make transcription errors, but in other ways more likely to copy exactly what he saw), and then made a copy himself. Since that time, the manuscript has crumbled further, making these transcripts prized witnesses to the text. While the recovery of at least 2000 letters can be attributed to them, their accuracy has been called into question, and the extent to which the manuscript was actually more readable in Thorkelin&#x27;s time is uncertain. Thorkelin used these transcriptions as the basis for the first complete edition of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, in Latin.

In 1922, Frederick Klaeber, a German philologist who worked at the University of Minnesota, published his edition of the poem, &quot;Beowulf and The Fight at Finnsburg&quot;; it became the &quot;central source used by graduate students for the study of the poem and by scholars and teachers as the basis of their translations.&quot; The edition included an extensive glossary of Old English terms. His third edition was published in 1936, with the last version in his lifetime being a revised reprint in 1950. Klaeber&#x27;s text was re-presented with new introductory material, notes, and glosses, in a fourth edition in 2008.

Another widely used edition is Elliott Van Kirk Dobbie&#x27;s, published in 1953 in the Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records series. The British Library, meanwhile, took a prominent role in supporting Kevin Kiernan&#x27;s &quot;Electronic Beowulf&quot;; the first edition appeared in 1999, and the fourth in 2014.

=== Translations and adaptations ===
The tightly interwoven structure of Old English poetry makes translating &quot;Beowulf&quot; a severe technical challenge. Despite this, a great number of translations and adaptations are available, in poetry and prose. Andy Orchard, in &quot;A Critical Companion to Beowulf&quot;, lists 33 &quot;representative&quot; translations in his bibliography, while the Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies published Marijane Osborn&#x27;s annotated list of over 300 translations and adaptations in 2003. &quot;Beowulf&quot; has been translated many times in verse and in prose, and adapted for stage and screen. By 2020, the Beowulf&#x27;s Afterlives Bibliographic Database listed some 688 translations and other versions of the poem. &quot;Beowulf&quot; has been translated into at least 38 other languages.
In 1805, the historian Sharon Turner translated selected verses into modern English. This was followed in 1814 by John Josias Conybeare who published an edition &quot;in English paraphrase and Latin verse translation.&quot; N. F. S. Grundtvig reviewed Thorkelin&#x27;s edition in 1815 and created the first complete verse translation in Danish in 1820. In 1837, John Mitchell Kemble created an important literal translation in English. In 1895, William Morris and A. J. Wyatt published the ninth English translation.
In 1909, Francis Barton Gummere&#x27;s full translation in &quot;English imitative metre&quot; was published, and was used as the text of Gareth Hinds&#x27;s 2007 graphic novel based on &quot;Beowulf&quot;. In 1975, John Porter published the first complete verse translation of the poem entirely accompanied by facing-page Old English. Seamus Heaney&#x27;s 1999 translation of the poem (&quot;&quot;, called &quot;Heaneywulf&quot; by the &quot;Beowulf&quot; translator Howell Chickering and many others) was both praised and criticised. The US publication was commissioned by W. W. Norton &amp; Company, and was included in the &quot;Norton Anthology of English Literature&quot;. Many retellings of &quot;Beowulf&quot; for children appeared in the 20th century.
In 2000 (2nd edition 2013), Liuzza published his own version of &quot;Beowulf&quot; in a parallel text with the Old English, with his analysis of the poem&#x27;s historical, oral, religious and linguistic contexts. R. D. Fulk, of Indiana University, published a facing-page edition and translation of the entire Nowell Codex manuscript in 2010. Hugh Magennis&#x27;s 2011 &quot;Translating Beowulf: Modern Versions in English Verse&quot; discusses the challenges and history of translating the poem, as well as the question of how to approach its poetry, and discusses several post-1950 verse translations, paying special attention to those of Edwin Morgan, Burton Raffel, Michael J. Alexander, and Seamus Heaney. Translating &quot;Beowulf&quot; is one of the subjects of the 2012 publication &quot;Beowulf at Kalamazoo&quot;, containing a section with 10 essays on translation, and a section with 22 reviews of Heaney&#x27;s translation, some of which compare Heaney&#x27;s work with Liuzza&#x27;s. Tolkien&#x27;s long-awaited prose translation (edited by his son Christopher) was published in 2014 as &quot;&quot;. The book includes Tolkien&#x27;s own retelling of the story of Beowulf in his tale &quot;Sellic Spell&quot;, but not his incomplete and unpublished verse translation. &quot;The Mere Wife&quot;, by Maria Dahvana Headley, was published in 2018. It relocates the action to a wealthy community in 20th-century America and is told primarily from the point of view of Grendel&#x27;s mother. In 2020, Headley published a translation in which the opening &quot;Hwæt!&quot; is rendered &quot;Bro!&quot;; this translation subsequently won the Hugo Award for Best Related Work.

== Sources and analogues ==

Neither identified sources nor analogues for &quot;Beowulf&quot; can be definitively proven, but many conjectures have been made. These are important in helping historians understand the &quot;Beowulf&quot; manuscript, as possible source-texts or influences would suggest time-frames of composition, geographic boundaries within which it could be composed, or range (both spatial and temporal) of influence (i.e. when it was &quot;popular&quot; and where its &quot;popularity&quot; took it). The poem has been related to Scandinavian, Celtic, and international folkloric sources.

===Scandinavian parallels and sources===

19th-century studies proposed that &quot;Beowulf&quot; was translated from a lost original Scandinavian work; surviving Scandinavian works have continued to be studied as possible sources. In 1886 Gregor Sarrazin suggested that an Old Norse original version of &quot;Beowulf&quot; must have existed, but in 1914 Carl Wilhelm von Sydow claimed that &quot;Beowulf&quot; is fundamentally Christian and was written at a time when any Norse tale would have most likely been pagan. Another proposal was a parallel with the &quot;Grettis Saga&quot;, but in 1998, Magnús Fjalldal challenged that, stating that tangential similarities were being overemphasised as analogies. The story of Hrolf Kraki and his servant, the legendary bear-shapeshifter Bodvar Bjarki, has also been suggested as a possible parallel; he survives in &quot;Hrólfs saga kraka&quot; and Saxo&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, while Hrolf Kraki, one of the Scyldings, appears as &quot;Hrothulf&quot; in &quot;Beowulf&quot;. New Scandinavian analogues to &quot;Beowulf&quot; continue to be proposed regularly, with Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar being the most recently adduced text.

=== International folktale sources ===

 (1910) wrote a thesis that the first part of &quot;Beowulf&quot; (the Grendel Story) incorporated preexisting folktale material, and that the folktale in question was of the Bear&#x27;s Son Tale (&quot;Bärensohnmärchen&quot;) type, which has surviving examples all over the world. This tale type was later catalogued as international folktale type 301 in the ATU Index, now formally entitled &quot;The Three Stolen Princesses&quot; type in Hans Uther&#x27;s catalogue, although the &quot;Bear&#x27;s Son&quot; is still used in Beowulf criticism, if not so much in folkloristic circles. However, although this folkloristic approach was seen as a step in the right direction, &quot;The Bear&#x27;s Son&quot; tale has later been regarded by many as not a close enough parallel to be a viable choice. Later, Peter A. Jorgensen, looking for a more concise frame of reference, coined a &quot;two-troll tradition&quot; that covers both &quot;Beowulf&quot; and &quot;Grettis saga&quot;: &quot;a Norse &#x27;ecotype&#x27; in which a hero enters a cave and kills two giants, usually of different sexes&quot;; this has emerged as a more attractive folk tale parallel, according to a 1998 assessment by Andersson.

The epic&#x27;s similarity to the Irish folktale &quot;The Hand and the Child&quot; was noted in 1899 by Albert S. Cook, and others even earlier. In 1914, the Swedish folklorist Carl Wilhelm von Sydow made a strong argument for parallelism with &quot;The Hand and the Child&quot;, because the folktale type demonstrated a &quot;monstrous arm&quot; motif that corresponded with Beowulf&#x27;s wrenching off Grendel&#x27;s arm. No such correspondence could be perceived in the Bear&#x27;s Son Tale or in the &quot;Grettis saga&quot;.
James Carney and Martin Puhvel agree with this &quot;Hand and the Child&quot; contextualisation. Puhvel supported the &quot;Hand and the Child&quot; theory through such motifs as (in Andersson&#x27;s words) &quot;the more powerful giant mother, the mysterious light in the cave, the melting of the sword in blood, the phenomenon of battle rage, swimming prowess, combat with water monsters, underwater adventures, and the bear-hug style of wrestling.&quot;
In the Mabinogion, Teyrnon discovers the otherworldly boy child Pryderi, the principal character of the cycle, after cutting off the arm of a monstrous beast which is stealing foals from his stables. The medievalist R. Mark Scowcroft notes that the tearing off of the monster&#x27;s arm without a weapon is found only in &quot;Beowulf&quot; and fifteen of the Irish variants of the tale; he identifies twelve parallels between the tale and &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

===Classical sources===

Attempts to find classical or Late Latin influence or analogue in &quot;Beowulf&quot; are almost exclusively linked with Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; or Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. In 1926, Albert S. Cook suggested a Homeric connection due to equivalent formulas, metonymies, and analogous voyages. In 1930, James A. Work supported the Homeric influence, stating that the encounter between Beowulf and Unferth was parallel to the encounter between Odysseus and Euryalus in Books 7–8 of the &quot;Odyssey,&quot; even to the point of both characters giving the hero the same gift of a sword upon being proven wrong in their initial assessment of the hero&#x27;s prowess. This theory of Homer&#x27;s influence on &quot;Beowulf&quot; remained very prevalent in the 1920s, but started to die out in the following decade when a handful of critics stated that the two works were merely &quot;comparative literature&quot;, although Greek was known in late 7th century England: Bede states that Theodore of Tarsus, a Greek, was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 668, and he taught Greek. Several English scholars and churchmen are described by Bede as being fluent in Greek due to being taught by him; Bede claims to be fluent in Greek himself.

Frederick Klaeber, among others, argued for a connection between &quot;Beowulf&quot; and Virgil near the start of the 20th century, claiming that the very act of writing a secular epic in a Germanic world represents Virgilian influence. Virgil was seen as the pinnacle of Latin literature, and Latin was the dominant literary language of England at the time, therefore making Virgilian influence highly likely. Similarly, in 1971, Alistair Campbell stated that the apologue technique used in &quot;Beowulf&quot; is so rare in epic poetry aside from Virgil that the poet who composed &quot;Beowulf&quot; could not have written the poem in such a manner without first coming across Virgil&#x27;s writings.

===Biblical influences===

It cannot be denied that Biblical parallels occur in the text, whether seen as a pagan work with &quot;Christian colouring&quot; added by scribes or as a &quot;Christian historical novel, with selected bits of paganism deliberately laid on as &#x27;local colour&#x27;&quot;, as Margaret E. Goldsmith did in &quot;The Christian Theme of &quot;Beowulf&quot;&quot;. &quot;Beowulf&quot; channels the Book of Genesis, the Book of Exodus, and the Book of Daniel in its inclusion of references to the Genesis creation narrative, the story of Cain and Abel, Noah and the flood, the Devil, Hell, and the Last Judgment.

== Dialect ==
&quot;Beowulf&quot; predominantly uses the West Saxon dialect of Old English, like other Old English poems copied at the time. However, it also uses many other linguistic forms; this leads some scholars to believe that it has endured a long and complicated transmission through all the main dialect areas. It retains a complicated mix of Mercian, Northumbrian, Early West Saxon, Anglian, Kentish and Late West Saxon dialectical forms.

== Form and metre ==

Old English poets typically used alliterative verse, a form of verse in which the first half of the line (the a-verse) is linked to the second half (the b-verse) through similarity in initial sound. That the line consists of two halves is clearly indicated by the caesura: (l. 4). This verse form maps stressed and unstressed syllables onto abstract entities known as metrical positions. There is no fixed number of beats per line: the first one cited has three () whereas the second has two ().

The poet had a choice of formulae to assist in fulfilling the alliteration scheme. These were memorised phrases that conveyed a general and commonly-occurring meaning that fitted neatly into a half-line of the chanted poem. Examples are line 8&#x27;s (&quot;waxed under welkin&quot;, i.e. &quot;he grew up under the heavens&quot;), line 11&#x27;s (&quot;pay tribute&quot;), line 13&#x27;s (&quot;young in the yards&quot;, i.e. &quot;young in the courts&quot;), and line 14&#x27;s (&quot;as a comfort to his people&quot;).

Kennings are a significant technique in &quot;Beowulf&quot;. They are evocative poetic descriptions of everyday things, often created to fill the alliterative requirements of the metre. For example, a poet might call the sea the &quot;swan&#x27;s riding&quot;; a king might be called a &quot;ring-giver&quot;. The poem contains many kennings, and the device is typical of much of classic poetry in Old English, which is heavily formulaic. The poem, too, makes extensive use of elided metaphors.

== Interpretation and criticism ==

The history of modern &quot;Beowulf&quot; criticism is often said to begin with Tolkien, author and Merton Professor of Anglo-Saxon at the University of Oxford, who in his 1936 lecture to the British Academy criticised his contemporaries&#x27; excessive interest in its historical implications. He noted in &quot;&quot; that as a result the poem&#x27;s literary value had been largely overlooked, and argued that the poem &quot;is in fact so interesting as poetry, in places poetry so powerful, that this quite overshadows the historical content...&quot; Tolkien argued that the poem is not an epic; that, while no conventional term exactly fits, the nearest would be elegy; and that its focus is the concluding dirge.

=== Paganism and Christianity ===

In historical terms, the poem&#x27;s characters were Germanic pagans, yet the poem was recorded by Christian Anglo-Saxons who had mostly converted from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism around the 7th century. &quot;Beowulf&quot; thus depicts a Germanic warrior society, in which the relationship between the lord of the region and those who served under him was of paramount importance.

In terms of the relationship between characters in &quot;Beowulf&quot; and God, one might recall the substantial amount of paganism that is present throughout the work. Literary critics such as Fred C. Robinson argue that the &quot;Beowulf&quot; poet tries to send a message to readers during the Anglo-Saxon time period regarding the state of Christianity in their own time. Robinson argues that the intensified religious aspects of the Anglo-Saxon period inherently shape the way in which the poet alludes to paganism as presented in &quot;Beowulf&quot;. The poet calls on Anglo-Saxon readers to recognize the imperfect aspects of their supposed Christian lifestyles. In other words, the poet is referencing their &quot;Anglo-Saxon Heathenism&quot;. In terms of the characters of the epic itself, Robinson argues that readers are &quot;impressed&quot; by the courageous acts of Beowulf and the speeches of Hrothgar. But one is ultimately left to feel sorry for both men as they are fully detached from supposed &quot;Christian truth&quot;. The relationship between the characters of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, and the overall message of the poet, regarding their relationship with God is debated among readers and literary critics alike.

Richard North argues that the &quot;Beowulf&quot; poet interpreted &quot;Danish myths in Christian form&quot; (as the poem would have served as a form of entertainment for a Christian audience), and states: &quot;As yet we are no closer to finding out why the first audience of &quot;Beowulf&quot; liked to hear stories about people routinely classified as damned. This question is pressing, given... that Anglo-Saxons saw the Danes as &#x27;s&#x27; rather than as foreigners.&quot; Donaldson wrote that &quot;the poet who put the materials into their present form was a Christian and ... poem reflects a Christian tradition&quot;.

Other scholars disagree as to whether &quot;Beowulf&quot; is a Christian work set in a Germanic pagan context. The question suggests that the conversion from the Germanic pagan beliefs to Christian ones was a prolonged and gradual process over several centuries, and the poem&#x27;s message in respect to religious belief at the time it was written remains unclear. Robert F. Yeager describes the basis for these questions:

Ursula Schaefer&#x27;s view is that the poem was created, and is interpretable, within both pagan and Christian horizons. Schaefer&#x27;s concept of &quot;vocality&quot; offers neither a compromise nor a synthesis of views that see the poem as on the one hand Germanic, pagan, and oral and on the other Latin-derived, Christian, and literate, but, as stated by Monika Otter: &quot;a &#x27;tertium quid&#x27;, a modality that participates in both oral and literate culture yet also has a logic and aesthetic of its own.&quot;

=== Politics and warfare ===

Stanley B. Greenfield has suggested that references to the human body throughout &quot;Beowulf&quot; emphasise the relative position of thanes to their lord. He argues that the term &quot;shoulder-companion&quot; could refer to both a physical arm as well as a thane (Aeschere) who was very valuable to his lord (Hrothgar). With Aeschere&#x27;s death, Hrothgar turns to Beowulf as his new &quot;arm&quot;. Greenfield argues the foot is used for the opposite effect, only appearing four times in the poem. It is used in conjunction with Unferð (a man described by Beowulf as weak, traitorous, and cowardly). Greenfield notes that Unferð is described as &quot;at the king&#x27;s feet&quot; (line 499). Unferð is a member of the foot troops, who, throughout the story, do nothing and &quot;generally serve as backdrops for more heroic action.&quot;

Daniel Podgorski has argued that the work is best understood as an examination of inter-generational vengeance-based conflict, or feuding. In this context, the poem operates as an indictment of feuding conflicts as a function of its conspicuous, circuitous, and lengthy depiction of the Swedish–Geatish wars—coming into contrast with the poem&#x27;s depiction of the protagonist Beowulf as being disassociated from the ongoing feuds in every way. Francis Leneghan argues that the poem can be understood as a &quot;dynastic drama&quot; in which the hero&#x27;s fights with the monsters unfold against a backdrop of the rise and fall of royal houses, while the monsters themselves serve as portents of disasters affecting dynasties.

<text>Barb Wire is a fictional character appearing in Comics Greatest World, an imprint of Dark Horse Comics. Created by Chris Warner and Team CGW, the character first appeared in &quot;Comics&#x27; Greatest World: Steel Harbor&quot; in 1993. The original &quot;Barb Wire&quot; series published nine issues between 1994 and 1995 and was followed by a four-issue miniseries in 1996. A reboot was published in 2015 and lasted eight issues. In 1996, the character was adapted into a film starring Pamela Anderson. Unlike the comics, the film takes place in a possible future rather than an alternate version of present-day Earth.

==Fictional character biography==
Barb Wire&#x27;s stories take place on an alternate version of present-day Earth with superhumans and more advanced technology. In this Earth&#x27;s history, an alien entity called the Vortex arrived in 1931 and began conducting secret experiments. In 1947, an atom bomb test detonated in a desert nearby the alien&#x27;s experiments. The result was the creation of a trans-dimensional wormhole referred to as &quot;the Vortex&quot; or &quot;the Maelstrom&quot;, which released energy that gave different people across Earth superpowers for years to come.

Decades later, Barbara Kopetski grows up in Steel Harbor when it is still a thriving steel industry city. Barbara and her brother Charlie live with their grandmother and parents, their mother being a police officer while their father is a former marine who became a steelworker. Officer Kopetski later dies, after which her husband becomes so ill he is confined to a bed for years, developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease as well before passing away. Following the death of her father, Barbara leaves Steel Harbour for a time as the city&#x27;s economy starts to spiral and crime begins rising. Soon, much of the city is controlled by warring gangs rather than local government. Years later, Barbara returns to Steel Harbor, now an experienced bounty hunter operating under the name Barb Wire. Reuniting with Charlie, she decides to stay in her hometown, becoming the owner of the Hammerhead bar. To help bring in money, she continues moonlighting as a bounty hunter, working with the police directly or bail bondsman Thomas Crashell.

As time goes on, Steel Harbor becomes more dangerous, described as &quot;a city under siege from drugs, crime, pollution and gang warfare&quot;. In 1993, a second American Civil War begins when Golden City announces its secession from the Union. The announcement leads to protests and riots in several cities. The Steel Harbor Riots leave some neighborhoods in literal ruin, with hundreds of buildings destroyed or abandoned in the area known as &quot;Metal City&quot;. Many are forced to leave the city or take to the streets, and the gangs (all of whom have superhuman members) start moving to take more control. To help contain the chaos and keep her home from descending further, Barb Wire now acts at times as a vigilante, intervening when the police can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t. Fighting alongside the Wolf Gang, she defies criminal Mace Blitzkrieg&#x27;s attempts to bring all gangs under his leadership and control the city.

Growing up with a police officer mother and marine father, as well as her life experiences traveling outside of the city, Barb Wire is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, skilled in various firearms, and an expert driver and motorcycle rider. Her bar has been considered neutral meeting ground by the Steel Harbor gangs. Aiding her bounty hunter activities is her brother Charlie, acting as her mechanic and engineer, and others such as Avram Roman Jr., a cyborg sometimes known simply as &quot;the Machine&quot;. Though she has loyal allies, including Charlie, Barb Wire is a harsh, guarded person who looks at the world with suspicion and cynicism, considering herself a loner at heart.

===Other characters===
====Supporting characters====
* Charlie Kopetski, Barb&#x27;s brother, a blind mechanic, and engineering genius. He invents and maintains most of her weapons and superhuman restraining devices. He openly complains about how often he must fix the equipment she continuously breaks during her adventures.

====Allies====
* The Machine, real name: Avram Roman Jr. A man whose body is inhabited by a self-repairing machine colony, making him an advanced cyborg. Along with a reinforced skeleton, superhuman strength and enhanced durability, he is capable of rebuilding parts of his body. Over time, he becomes more machine-like in nature, no longer requiring food.
* Motörhead, real name: Frank Fletcher. A drifter with psychic powers who is bonded to an ancient, powerful artifact known as the Motor.
* Wolf Gang, a group that believe gangs shouldn&#x27;t go too far in their activities and victimize the city, and prefer independence and a balance of power rather than uniting all gangs under one leader. The Wolf Gang is formidable and its members are known for discipline and loyalty. The gang includes five superhumans: Burner (fire abilities); Bomber (creates energy bombs); Breaker (superhuman strength); Cutter (energy blades); and their leader Wolf Ferrell, also known as Hunter (enhanced senses).
* Ghost, real name: Elisa Cameron. A popular Dark Horse Comics character with ghost-like abilities who has a brief crossover story with Barb Wire.

====Enemies====
* The Prime Movers, a collective of street gang leaders who agree to serve under the leadership of superhumanly strong criminal Mace Blitzkrieg. The gang leaders include Airborne, Blackbelt, Deadlight, Hurricane Max, Ignition, and Killerwatt.
* Death Card (appearing in the first &quot;Barb Wire&quot; regular series).
* Death Card II (appearing in the &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; mini-series) - an assassin.
* Ignition II - Maureen Skach. Girlfriend of Boyd Mack, the original Ignition, a gang leader with pyrokinetic powers. Believing Mack was having an affair with Barb Wire, Skach kills him, then assumes the Ignition name and leadership of his gang.
* The Mask

==Film adaptation==

A film adaptation was released in 1996 starring Pamela Anderson as Barb Wire. The story&#x27;s premise was that Barb Wire lives in the near future rather than an alternate version of the present day, a world where superhumans and Dark Horse superheroes do not exist. In this version of the story, Steel Harbor is the last neutral &quot;free city&quot; during the Second American Civil War, and Barbara Kopetski is a resistance fighter who leaves behind the war after her heart is broken and she loses faith in the cause. Like the comic, she returns home to become a bounty hunter and owner of the Hammerhead.

<doc id="3837" wikidata="Q957323" url="?curid=3837" title="Blazing Saddles">
<text>Blazing Saddles is a 1974 American satirical postmodernist Western black comedy film directed by Mel Brooks, who co-wrote the screenplay with Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor, Norman Steinberg and Alan Uger, based on a story treatment by Bergman. The film stars Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder. Brooks appears in two supporting roles: Governor William J. Le Petomane, and a Yiddish-speaking Native American chief; he also dubs lines for one of Lili Von Shtupp&#x27;s backing troupe and a cranky moviegoer. The supporting cast includes Slim Pickens, Alex Karras and David Huddleston, as well as Brooks regulars Dom DeLuise, Madeline Kahn and Harvey Korman. Bandleader Count Basie has a cameo as himself, appearing with his orchestra.

The film is full of deliberate anachronisms, from the Count Basie Orchestra playing &quot;April in Paris&quot; in the Wild West, to Pickens&#x27; character mentioning the &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;.

The film received generally positive reviews from critics and audiences, was nominated for three Academy Awards and is today regarded as a comedy classic. It is ranked number six on the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;100 Years...100 Laughs&quot; list, and was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2006.

== Plot ==
On the American frontier of 1874, a new railroad under construction will have to be rerouted through the town of Rock Ridge to avoid quicksand. Realizing this will make Rock Ridge worth millions, territorial attorney general Hedley Lamarr plans to force Rock Ridge&#x27;s residents out of the town and sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky Taggart, to shoot the sheriff and trash the town.

The townspeople demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart, a black railroad worker about to be executed for assaulting Taggart. A black sheriff, Lamarr reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos and leave Rock Ridge at his mercy.

After an initial hostile reception in which he takes himself &quot;hostage&quot; to escape, Bart relies on his quick wits and the assistance of Jim, an alcoholic gunslinger known as the &quot;Waco Kid&quot;, to overcome the townspeople&#x27;s hostility. Bart subdues Mongo, an immensely strong and dim-witted, yet philosophical henchman sent to kill him, then outwits German seductress-for-hire Lili Von Shtupp at her own game, with Lili falling in love with him.

Upon release, Mongo vaguely informs Bart of Lamarr&#x27;s connection to the railroad, so Bart and Jim visit the railroad worksite and discover from Bart&#x27;s best friend Charlie that the railway is planned to go through Rock Ridge. Taggart and his men arrive to kill Bart, but Jim outshoots them and forces their retreat. Furious that his schemes have backfired, Lamarr recruits an army of thugs, including common criminals, motorcycle gangsters, Ku Klux Klansmen, Nazi soldiers, and Methodists.

East of Rock Ridge, Bart introduces the White townspeople to the black, Chinese, and Irish railroad workers who have all agreed to help them in exchange for acceptance by the community, and explains his plan to defeat Lamarr&#x27;s army. They labor all night to build a perfect copy of the town as a diversion. When Bart realizes it will not be enough to fool the villains, the townsfolk construct copies of themselves.

Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the &quot;Gov. William J. Le Petomane Thruway&quot;, forcing the raiding party to send for change to pay the toll. Once through the tollbooth, the raiders attack the fake town and its population of dummies, which have been booby trapped with dynamite. After Jim detonates the bombs with his sharpshooting, launching bad guys and horses skyward, the Rock Ridgers attack the villains with Lili singing with the Nazi soldiers.

The resulting brawl between townsfolk, railroad workers, and Lamarr&#x27;s thugs literally breaks the fourth wall and bursts onto a neighboring movie set where director Buddy Bizarre is filming a Busby Berkeley-style top-hat-and-tails musical number. Then the brawl spreads into the studio commissary for a food fight and spills out of the Warner Bros. film lot onto the streets of Burbank.

Lamarr escapes the brawl and takes a taxi to hide at Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theatre which is showing the premiere of &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;. As he settles into his seat, he sees onscreen Bart arriving on horseback outside the theatre. Bart blocks Lamarr&#x27;s escape and shoots him in the groin. Bart and Jim then enter the theater to watch the end of the film.

Back in the film, Bart announces to the townspeople that he is moving on because his work is done (and because he is bored). Riding out of town, he finds Jim, still eating his popcorn, and invites him along to &quot;nowhere special&quot;. The two friends briefly ride into the desert before dismounting and boarding a limousine which drives off into the sunset.

== Cast ==
Cast notes:
* Count Basie and his orchestra make a cameo appearance, playing &quot;April in Paris&quot; in the middle of the desert as Bart rides toward Rock Ridge to assume the post of sheriff.
* Brooks appears in three on-screen roles: Governor William J. Le Petomane, the Yiddish-speaking Native American chief (appearing in redface) in Bart&#x27;s backstory, and an applicant for Hedley Lamarr&#x27;s thug army (an aviator wearing sunglasses and a flight jacket). He also has two off-screen voice roles, as one of Lili&#x27;s German chorus boys during &quot;I&#x27;m Tired&quot; and as a grouchy moviegoer. 
* &quot;Le Petomane&quot; refers to Joseph Pujol, a performer in 19th-century France who was a professional flatulist using &quot;Le Pétomane&quot; as his stage name.
* Carol Arthur (Harriett Johnson) was DeLuise&#x27;s wife.
* &quot;Olson Johnson&quot; is a reference to the vaudeville comedy team Olsen and Johnson, &quot;Howard Johnson&quot; to the now-defunct Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant chain, &quot;Van Johnson&quot; to the actor Van Johnson, and &quot;Dr. Samuel Johnson&quot; to the 18th-century English writer by that name. The character of &quot;Gabby Johnson&quot; is a direct parody of cowboy actor Gabby Hayes.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
The idea came from a story outline written by Andrew Bergman that he originally intended to develop and produce himself. &quot;I wrote a first draft called &quot;Tex-X&quot;&quot; (a play on Malcolm X&#x27;s name), he said. &quot;Alan Arkin was hired to direct and James Earl Jones was going to play the sheriff. That fell apart, as things often do.&quot; Brooks was taken with the story, which he described as &quot;hip talk—1974 talk and expressions—happening in 1874 in the Old West&quot;, and purchased the film rights from Bergman. Though he had not worked with a writing team since &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, he hired a group of writers (including Bergman) to expand the outline, and posted a large sign: &quot;Please do not write a polite script.&quot;

Brooks described the writing process as chaotic: Bergman remembers the room being just as chaotic, telling &quot;Creative Screenwriting&quot;, 

=== Title ===
The original title, &quot;Tex X&quot;, was rejected to avoid it being mistaken for an X-rated film, as were &quot;Black Bart&quot; – a reference to Black Bart, a white highwayman of the 19th century – and &quot;Purple Sage&quot;. Brooks said he finally conceived &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; one morning while taking a shower.

=== Casting ===
Richard Pryor was Brooks&#x27; original choice to play Sheriff Bart, but the studio, claiming his history of drug arrests made him uninsurable, refused to approve financing with Pryor as the star. The role of Sheriff Bart went to Cleavon Little, and Pryor remained as a screenwriter instead. Brooks offered the other leading role, the Waco Kid, to John Wayne. He declined it, deeming the film &quot;too blue&quot; for his family-oriented image, but assured Brooks that &quot;he would be the first one in line to see it.&quot; After that, Dan Dailey was Brooks&#x27; first choice for the role. Gig Young was cast, but he collapsed during his first scene from what was later determined to be alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and Gene Wilder was flown in to replace him.

Johnny Carson and Wilder both turned down the Hedley Lamarr role before Harvey Korman was cast. Madeline Kahn objected when Brooks asked to see her legs during her audition. &quot;She said, &#x27;So it&#x27;s THAT kind of an audition? Brooks recalled. &quot;I explained that I was a happily married man and that I needed someone who could straddle a chair with her legs like Marlene Dietrich in &quot;Destry Rides Again.&quot; So she lifted her skirt and said, &#x27;No touching.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography began on March 6, 1973, and wrapped in early May 1973. Brooks had numerous conflicts over content with Warner Bros. executives, including frequent use of the word &quot;nigger&quot;, Lili Von Shtupp&#x27;s seduction scene, the cacophony of flatulence around the campfire and Mongo punching out a horse. Brooks, whose contract gave him final cut, declined to make any substantive changes, with the exception of cutting Bart&#x27;s final line during Lili&#x27;s seduction: &quot;I hate to disappoint you, ma&#x27;am, but you&#x27;re sucking my arm.&quot; When asked later about the many &quot;nigger&quot; references, Brooks said he received consistent support from Pryor and Little. He added: &quot;If they did a remake of &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; today [2012], they would leave out the N-word. And then, you&#x27;ve got no movie.&quot; Brooks said the use of the N-word was to show how despised, hated, and loathed the black sheriff was. Brooks said he received many letters of complaint after the film&#x27;s release.

=== Music ===
Brooks wrote the music and lyrics for three of &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;″ songs, &quot;The Ballad of Rock Ridge&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Tired&quot;, and &quot;The French Mistake&quot;. Brooks also wrote the lyrics to the title song, with music by composer John Morris. To sing the title song, Brooks advertised in the trade papers for a &quot;Frankie Laine–type&quot; singer; to his surprise, Laine himself offered his services. &quot;Frankie sang his heart out ... and we didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell him it was a spoof. He never heard the whip cracks; we put those in later. We got so lucky with his serious interpretation of the song.&quot;In an interview with Terry Gross, Laine said that he did not know at the time that &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; was a comedy.

The choreographer for &quot;I&#x27;m Tired&quot; and &quot;The French Mistake&quot; was Alan Johnson. &quot;I&#x27;m Tired&quot; is a homage to and parody of Marlene Dietrich&#x27;s performance of Cole Porter&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;m the Laziest Gal in Town&quot; in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1950 film &quot;Stage Fright&quot;, as well as &quot;Falling in Love Again (Can&#x27;t Help It)&quot; from &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;.

The orchestrations were by Morris and Jonathan Tunick.

== Lawsuit ==
During production, retired longtime film star Hedy Lamarr sued Warner Bros. for $100,000, charging that the film&#x27;s running parody of her name infringed on her right to privacy. Brooks said that he was flattered and chose to not fight it in court; the studio settled out of court for a small sum and an apology for &quot;almost using her name&quot;. Brooks said that Lamarr &quot;never got the joke&quot;. This lawsuit would be referenced by an in-film joke where Brooks&#x27; character, the Governor, tells Lamarr that &quot;This is 1874; you&#x27;ll be able to sue HER.&quot;

== Release ==
The film was almost unreleased. &quot;When we screened it for executives, there were few laughs,&quot; said Brooks. &quot;The head of distribution said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s dump it and take a loss.&#x27; But [studio president John] Calley insisted they open it in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago as a test. It became the studio&#x27;s top moneymaker that summer.&quot;

The world premiere took place on February 7, 1974, at the Pickwick Drive-In Theater in Burbank; 250 invited guests—including Little and Wilder—watched the film on horseback.

=== Critical response ===
While &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; is now considered a classic, critical reaction was mixed upon initial release. Vincent Canby wrote:
Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four, calling it a &quot;crazed grab bag of a movie that does everything to keep us laughing except hit us over the head with a rubber chicken. Mostly, it succeeds. It&#x27;s an audience picture; it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of classy polish and its structure is a total mess. But of course! What does that matter while Alex Karras is knocking a horse cold with a right cross to the jaw?&quot; Gene Siskel awarded three stars out of four and called it &quot;bound to rank with the funniest of the year,&quot; adding, &quot;Whenever the laughs begin to run dry, Brooks and his quartet of gag writers splash about in a pool of obscenities that score belly laughs if your ears aren&#x27;t sensitive and if you&#x27;re hip to western movie conventions being parodied.&quot;

Critics often perceived &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; as inherently &quot;un-cinematic&quot;, defying some expectations for Hollywood filmmaking in the era, often displaying production style associated with Broadway theater and US television variety shows. This was in part due to its &quot;simplistic framing&quot; and the casting of Harvey Korman, known for &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; (CBS, 1967–1978), which was similarly &quot;low on characterization and story, instead opting for a high volume of one-liners and visual gags.&quot; Typical to this perception, &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;If comedies are measured solely by the number of yocks they generate from audiences, then &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; must be counted a success ... Few viewers will have time between laughs to complain that pic is essentially a raunchy, protracted version of a television comedy skit.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;irreverent, outrageous, improbable, often as blithely tasteless as a stag night at the Friar&#x27;s Club and almost continuously funny.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was negative, writing: &quot;Mel Brooks squanders a snappy title on a stockpile of stale jokes. To say that this slapdash Western spoof lacks freshness and spontaneity and originality is putting it mildly. &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; is at once a messy and antiquated gag machine.&quot; Jan Dawson of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;Perhaps it is pedantic to complain that the whole is not up to the sum of its parts when, for the curate&#x27;s egg that it is, &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; contains so many good parts and memorable performances.&quot; John Simon wrote a negative review of &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, saying: &quot;All kinds of gags—chiefly anachronisms, irrelevancies, reverse ethnic jokes, and out and out vulgarities—are thrown together pell-mell, batted about insanely in all directions, and usually beaten into the ground.&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 69 reviews, with an average rating of 8.10/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Daring, provocative, and laugh-out-loud funny, &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; is a gleefully vulgar spoof of Westerns that marks a high point in Mel Brooks&#x27; storied career.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 73 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Ishmael Reed&#x27;s 1969 novel &quot;Yellow Back Radio Broke-Down&quot; has been cited as an important precursor or influence for &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, a connection that Reed himself has made.

=== Box office ===
The film earned theatrical rentals of $26.7 million in its initial release in the United States and Canada. In its 1976 reissue, it earned a further $10.5 million and another $8 million in 1979. Its total rentals in the United States and Canada totalled $47.8 million from a gross of $119.5 million, becoming only the tenth film up to that time to pass the $100 million mark.

== Awards and accolades ==
While addressing his group of bad guys, Harvey Korman&#x27;s character reminds them that although they are risking their lives, he is &quot;risking an almost certain Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor!&quot; Korman did not receive an Oscar bid, but the film did get three nominations at the 47th Academy Awards, including Best Supporting Actress for Madeline Kahn.

In 2006, &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

Upon the release of the 30th-anniversary special edition in 2004, &quot;Today&quot; said that the movie &quot;skewer[ed] just about every aspect of racial prejudice while keeping the laughs coming&quot; and that it was &quot;at the top of a very short list&quot; of comedies still funny after 30 years. In 2014, NPR wrote that, four decades after the movie was made, it was &quot;still as biting a satire&quot; on racism as ever, although its treatment of gays and women was &quot;not self-aware at all&quot;.

The film is recognized by the American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – No. 6

== Adaptations ==
=== TV series ===
A television pilot titled &quot;Black Bart&quot; was produced for CBS based on Bergman&#x27;s original story. It featured Louis Gossett Jr. as Bart and Steve Landesberg as his drunkard sidekick, a former Confederate officer named &quot;Reb Jordan&quot;. Other cast members included Millie Slavin and Noble Willingham. Bergman is listed as the sole creator. CBS aired the pilot once on April 4, 1975. The pilot episode of &quot;Black Bart&quot; was later included as a bonus feature on the &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; 30th Anniversary DVD and the Blu-ray disc.

=== Possible stage production ===
In September 2017, Brooks indicated his desire to do a stage version of &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; in the future.

== In popular culture ==
The Rock Ridge standard for CD and DVD media is named after the town in &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;.

The 1988 animated television film &quot;The Good, the Bad, and Huckleberry Hound&quot; is a Western parody. Starring anthropomorphic cartoon dog Huckleberry Hound, the film is set in the California Gold Rush era and has similar spoofs and gags to &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, as well as depiction of Native American stereotypes. Here, much like Bart, Huck is unexpectedly appointed as a sheriff to defend townspeople.

In 2011, the fifteenth episode of &quot;Supernatural&quot; season 6 was entitled &quot;The French Mistake&quot;, as a reference to the genre defining Fourth Wall breaking scene.

The 2022 animated film &quot;Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank&quot;, starring Michael Cera, Samuel L. Jackson, Michelle Yeoh and Ricky Gervais, was originally titled &quot;Blazing Samurai&quot; and its creators called it &quot;equally inspired by and an homage to &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;.&quot; Brooks served as an executive producer for the production, voiced one of the characters, and received screenplay credit.

== Home media ==
The film was released on VHS several times and was first released on DVD in 1997, followed by a 30th Anniversary Special Edition DVD in 2004 and a Blu-ray version in 2006. A 40th anniversary Blu-ray set was released in 2014.

<doc id="3838" wikidata="Q312995" url="?curid=3838" title="Bruce Sterling">
<text>Michael Bruce Sterling (born April 14, 1954) is an American science fiction author known for his novels and short fiction and editorship of the &quot;Mirrorshades&quot; anthology. In particular, he is linked to the cyberpunk subgenre.

Sterling&#x27;s first science-fiction story, &quot;Man-Made Self&quot;, was sold in 1976. He is the author of science-fiction novels, including &quot;Schismatrix&quot; (1985), &quot;Islands in the Net&quot; (1988), and &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; (1994). In 1992, he published his first non-fiction book, &quot;The Hacker Crackdown: Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier&quot;.

He has been interviewed for documentaries such as &quot;Freedom Downtime&quot;, &quot;TechnoCalyps&quot; and &quot;Traceroute&quot;.

==Writing==
Sterling is one of the founders of the cyberpunk movement in science fiction, along with William Gibson, Rudy Rucker, John Shirley, Lewis Shiner, and Pat Cadigan. In addition, he is one of the subgenre&#x27;s chief ideological promulgators. This has earned him the nickname &quot;Chairman Bruce&quot;. He was also one of the first organizers of the Turkey City Writer&#x27;s Workshop, and is a frequent attendee at the Sycamore Hill Writer&#x27;s Workshop. He won Hugo Awards for his novelettes &quot;Bicycle Repairman&quot; (1996) and &quot;Taklamakan&quot; (1998). His first novel, &quot;Involution Ocean&quot; (1977), features the world Nullaqua where all the atmosphere is contained in a single, miles-deep crater. The story concerns a ship sailing on the ocean of dust at the bottom and hunting creatures called dustwhales. It is partially a science-fictional pastiche of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; by Herman Melville.

In the early 1980s, Sterling wrote a series of stories set in the Shaper/Mechanist universe: the Solar System is colonized, with two major warring factions. The Mechanists use a great deal of computer-based mechanical technologies; the Shapers do genetic engineering on a massive scale. The situation is complicated by the eventual contact with alien civilizations; humanity eventually splits into many subspecies, with the implication that some of these vanish from the galaxy, reminiscent of the singularity in the works of Vernor Vinge. The Shaper/Mechanist stories can be found in the collections &quot;Crystal Express&quot; and &quot;Schismatrix Plus&quot;, which contains the novel &quot;Schismatrix&quot; and all of the stories set in the Shaper/Mechanist universe. Alastair Reynolds identified &quot;Schismatrix&quot; and the other Shaper/Mechanist stories as one of the greatest influences on his own work.
In the 1980s, Sterling edited the science fiction critical fanzine &quot;Cheap Truth&quot; under the alias of Vincent Omniaveritas. He wrote a column called &quot;Catscan&quot; for the now-defunct science fiction critical magazine &quot;SF Eye&quot;. He contributed a chapter to &quot;Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture&quot; (MIT Press, 2008) edited by Paul D. Miller, a.k.a. DJ Spooky. From April 2009 through May 2009, he was an editor at &quot;Cool Tools&quot;.

From October 2003 to May 2020 Sterling blogged at &quot;Beyond the Beyond&quot;, which was hosted by &quot;Wired&quot; until the COVID-19 pandemic led Condé Nast to cut back because of an advertising slump. He also contributed to other print and online platforms, including &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;.

===Writing projects===
He has been the instigator of three projects which can be found on the Web:

* The Dead Media Project: A collection of &quot;research notes&quot; on dead media technologies, from Incan quipus, through Victorian phenakistoscopes, to the departed video game and home computers of the 1980s. The Project&#x27;s homepage, including Sterling&#x27;s original &quot;Dead Media Manifesto&quot; can be found at deadmedia.org.
* The Viridian Design Movement: His attempt to create a &quot;green&quot; design movement focused on high-tech, stylish, and ecologically sound design. The Viridian Design home page, including Sterling&#x27;s &quot;Viridian Manifesto&quot; and all of his &quot;Viridian Notes&quot;, is managed by Jon Lebkowsky. The Viridian Movement helped to spawn a popular &quot;bright green&quot; environmental weblog Worldchanging. WorldChanging contributors include many of the original members of the Viridian &quot;curia&quot;.
* Embrace the Decay: A web-only art piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in 2003. Incorporating contributions solicited through The Viridian Design &#x27;movement&#x27;, Embrace the Decay was the most visited piece/page at LA MOCA&#x27;s Digital Gallery, and included contributions from Jared Tarbell of levitated.net and co-author of several books on advanced Flash programming, and Monty Zukowski, creator of the winning &#x27;decay algorithm&#x27; sponsored by Sterling.

===Neologisms===
Sterling has coined various neologisms to describe things that he believes will be common in the future, especially items which already exist in limited numbers.
* In the December 2005 issue of &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, Sterling coined the term buckyjunk to refer to future, difficult-to-recycle consumer waste made of carbon nanotubes, a.k.a. buckytubes, based on buckyballs or buckminsterfullerene.
* In his 2005 book &quot;Shaping Things&quot;, he coined the term design fiction which refers to a type of speculative design which focuses on worldbuilding.
* In July 1989, in &quot;SF Eye #5&quot;, he was the first to use the word &quot;slipstream&quot; to refer to a type of speculative fiction between traditional science fiction and fantasy and mainstream literature.
* In August 2004, he suggested a type of technological device (he called it &quot;spime&quot;) that, through pervasive RFID and GPS tracking, can track its history of use and interact with the world.

==Bibliography==
Sterling&#x27;s novels include:

* &quot;Involution Ocean&quot; (1977)
* &quot;The Artificial Kid&quot; (1980)
* &quot;Schismatrix&quot; (1985)
* &quot;Islands in the Net&quot; (1988)
* &quot;The Difference Engine&quot; (1990; with William Gibson)
* &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; (1994)
* &quot;Holy Fire&quot; (1996)
* &quot;The Zenith Angle&quot; (2004)
* &quot;The Caryatids&quot; (2009)
* &quot;Love Is Strange&quot; (2012)

==Personal life==

In the beginning of his childhood he lived in Galveston, Texas until his family moved to India. Sterling spent several years in India and has a fondness for Bollywood films. In 1976, he graduated from the University of Texas with a degree in journalism. In 1978, he was the Dungeon Master for a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game whose players included Warren Spector, who cited Sterling&#x27;s game as a major inspiration for the game design of &quot;Deus Ex&quot;. 

In 2003, he was appointed professor at the European Graduate School where he is teaching summer intensive courses on media and design. In 2005, he became &quot;visionary in residence&quot; at ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, California. He lived in Belgrade with Serbian author and film-maker Jasmina Tešanović for several years, and married her in 2005. In September 2007 he moved to Turin, Italy. Both Sterling and artist and musician Florian-Ayala Fauna are sponsors for V. Vale&#x27;s RE/Search newsletter.

==Awards==

* 1989 John W. Campbell Memorial Award winner for the novel &quot;Islands in the Net&quot;
* 1997 Hugo Award winner for the novelette &quot;Bicycle Repairman&quot;
* 1999 Hugo Award winner for the novelette &quot;Taklamakan&quot;

<doc id="3840" wikidata="Q141440" url="?curid=3840" title="Brain abscess">
<text>Brain abscess (or cerebral abscess) is an abscess within the brain tissue caused by inflammation and collection of infected material coming from local (ear infection, dental abscess, infection of paranasal sinuses, infection of the mastoid air cells of the temporal bone, epidural abscess) or remote (lung, heart, kidney etc.) infectious sources. The infection may also be introduced through a skull fracture following a head trauma or surgical procedures. Brain abscess is usually associated with congenital heart disease in young children. It may occur at any age but is most frequent in the third decade of life.

==Signs and symptoms==
Fever, headache, and neurological problems, while classic, only occur in 20% of people with brain abscess.

The famous triad of fever, headache and focal neurologic findings are highly suggestive of brain abscess. These symptoms are caused by a combination of increased intracranial pressure due to a space-occupying lesion (headache, vomiting, confusion, coma), infection (fever, fatigue etc.) and focal neurologic brain tissue damage (hemiparesis, aphasia etc.).

The most frequent presenting symptoms are headache, drowsiness, confusion, seizures, hemiparesis or speech difficulties together with fever with a rapidly progressive course. Headache is characteristically worse at night and in the morning, as the intracranial pressure naturally increases when in the supine position. This elevation similarly stimulates the medullary vomiting center and area postrema, leading to morning vomiting.

Other symptoms and findings depend largely on the specific location of the abscess in the brain. An abscess in the cerebellum, for instance, may cause additional complaints as a result of brain stem compression and hydrocephalus. Neurological examination may reveal a stiff neck in occasional cases (erroneously suggesting meningitis).

==Pathophysiology==

===Bacterial===

Anaerobic and microaerophilic cocci and gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobic bacilli are the predominant bacterial isolates. Many brain abscesses are polymicrobial. The predominant organisms include: &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, aerobic and anaerobic streptococci (especially &quot;Streptococcus intermedius&quot;), &quot;Bacteroides&quot;, &quot;Prevotella&quot;, and &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; species, Enterobacteriaceae, &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species, and other anaerobes. Less common organisms include: &quot;Haemophillus influenzae&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; and &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;.

Bacterial abscesses rarely (if ever) arise &quot;de novo&quot; within the brain although establishing a cause can be difficult in many cases. There is almost always a primary lesion elsewhere in the body that must be sought assiduously because failure to treat the primary lesion will result in relapse. In cases of trauma, for example in compound skull fractures where fragments of bone are pushed into the substance of the brain, the cause of the abscess is obvious. Similarly, bullets and other foreign bodies may become sources of infection if left in place. The location of the primary lesion may be suggested by the location of the abscess: infections of the middle ear result in lesions in the middle and posterior cranial fossae; congenital heart disease with right-to-left shunts often result in abscesses in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery; and infection of the frontal and ethmoid sinuses usually results in collection in the subdural sinuses.

=== Other organisms ===
Fungi and parasites may also cause the disease. Fungi and parasites are especially associated with immunocompromised patients. Other causes include: &quot;Nocardia asteroides&quot;, &quot;Mycobacterium&quot;, Fungi (e.g. &quot;Aspergillus&quot;, &quot;Candida&quot;, &quot;Cryptococcus&quot;, &quot;Mucorales&quot;, &quot;Coccidioides&quot;, &quot;Histoplasma capsulatum&quot;, &quot;Blastomyces dermatitidis&quot;, &quot;Bipolaris&quot;, &quot;Exophiala dermatitidis&quot;, &quot;Curvularia pallescens&quot;, &quot;Ochroconis gallopava&quot;, &quot;Ramichloridium mackenziei&quot;, &quot;Pseudallescheria boydii&quot;), Protozoa (e.g. &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;, &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot;, &quot;Schistosoma&quot;, &quot;Paragonimus&quot;), and Helminths (e.g. &quot;Taenia solium&quot;). Organisms that are most frequently associated with brain abscess in patients with AIDS are poliovirus, &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, and &quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot;, though in infection with the latter organism, symptoms of meningitis generally predominate.

These organisms are associated with certain predisposing conditions:
* Sinus and dental infections—Aerobic and anaerobic streptococci, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (e.g. &quot;Prevotella&quot;, &quot;Porphyromonas&quot;, &quot;Bacteroides&quot;), &quot;Fusobacterium&quot;, &quot;S. aureus&quot;, and Enterobacteriaceae
* Penetrating trauma—&quot;S. aureus&quot;, aerobic streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and &quot;Clostridium&quot; spp.
* Pulmonary infections—Aerobic and anaerobic streptococci, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (e.g. &quot;Prevotella&quot;, &quot;Porphyromonas&quot;, &quot;Bacteroides&quot;), &quot;Fusobacterium&quot;, &quot;Actinomyces&quot;, and &quot;Nocardia&quot;
* Congenital heart disease—Aerobic and microaerophilic streptococci, and &quot;S. aureus&quot;
* HIV infection—&quot;T. gondii&quot;, &quot;Mycobacterium&quot;, &quot;Nocardia&quot;, &quot;Cryptococcus&quot;, and &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;
* Transplantation—&quot;Aspergillus&quot;, &quot;Candida&quot;, &quot;Cryptococcus&quot;, &quot;Mucorales&quot;, &quot;Nocardia&quot;, and &quot;T. gondii&quot;
* Neutropenia—Aerobic gram-negative bacilli, &quot;Aspergillus&quot;, &quot;Candida&quot;, and &quot;Mucorales&quot;

== Diagnosis ==

The diagnosis is established by a computed tomography (CT) (with contrast) examination. At the initial phase of the inflammation (which is referred to as cerebritis), the immature lesion does not have a capsule and it may be difficult to distinguish it from other space-occupying lesions or infarcts of the brain. Within 4–5 days the inflammation and the concomitant dead brain tissue are surrounded with a capsule, which gives the lesion the famous ring-enhancing lesion appearance on CT examination with contrast (since intravenously applied contrast material can not pass through the capsule, it is collected around the lesion and looks as a ring surrounding the relatively dark lesion). Lumbar puncture procedure, which is performed in many infectious disorders of the central nervous system is contraindicated in this condition (as it is in all space-occupying lesions of the brain) because removing a certain portion of the cerebrospinal fluid may alter the concrete intracranial pressure balances and causes the brain tissue to move across structures within the skull (brain herniation).

Ring enhancement may also be observed in cerebral hemorrhages (bleeding) and some brain tumors. However, in the presence of the rapidly progressive course with fever, focal neurologic findings (hemiparesis, aphasia etc.) and signs of increased intracranial pressure, the most likely diagnosis should be the brain abscess.

==Treatment==
The treatment includes lowering the increased intracranial pressure and starting intravenous antibiotics (and meanwhile identifying the causative organism mainly by blood culture studies).

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2 or HBOT) is indicated as a primary and adjunct treatment which provides four primary functions.
Firstly, HBOT reduces intracranial pressure. Secondly, high partial pressures of oxygen act as a bactericide and thus inhibits the anaerobic and functionally anaerobic flora common in brain abscess. Third, HBOT optimizes the immune function thus enhancing the host defense mechanisms and fourth, HBOT has been found to be of benefit when brain abscess is concomitant with cranial osteomyelitis.

Secondary functions of HBOT include increased stem cell production and up-regulation of VEGF which aid in the healing and recovery process.

Surgical drainage of the abscess remains part of the standard management of bacterial brain abscesses. The location and treatment of the primary lesion is also crucial, as is the removal of any foreign material (bone, dirt, bullets, and so forth).

There are few exceptions to this rule: &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; meningitis is often associated with subdural effusions that are mistaken for subdural empyemas. These effusions resolve with antibiotics and require no surgical treatment. Tuberculosis can produce brain abscesses that look identical to conventional bacterial abscesses on CT imaging. Surgical drainage or aspiration is often necessary to identify &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, but once the diagnosis is made no further surgical intervention is necessary.

CT guided stereotactic aspiration is also indicated in the treatment of brain abscess. The use of pre-operative imaging, intervention with post-operative clinical and biochemical monitoring used to manage brain abscesses today dates back to the Pennybacker system pioneered by Somerset, Kentucky-born neurosurgeon Joseph Buford Pennybacker, director of the neurosurgery department of the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford from 1952 to 1971. 

==Prognosis==
While death occurs in about 10% of cases, people do well about 70% of the time. This is a large improvement from the 1960s due to improved ability to image the head, more effective neurosurgery and more effective antibiotics.

<text>Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot ( ; ; born 28 September 1934), often referred to by her initials B.B., is a French former actress, singer, and model as well as an animal rights activist. Famous for portraying characters with hedonistic lifestyles, she is one of the best known symbols of the sexual revolution. Although she withdrew from the entertainment industry in 1973, she remains a major pop culture icon. She has acted in 47 films, performed in several musicals, and recorded more than 60 songs. She was awarded the Legion of Honour in 1985.

Born and raised in Paris, Bardot was an aspiring ballerina during her childhood. She started her acting career in 1952 and achieved international recognition in 1957 for her role in &quot;And God Created Woman&quot; (1956), catching the attention of many French intellectuals and earning her the nickname &quot;sex kitten&quot;. She was the subject of philosopher Simone de Beauvoir&#x27;s 1959 essay &quot;The Lolita Syndrome&quot;, which described her as a &quot;locomotive of women&#x27;s history&quot; and built upon existentialist themes to declare her the most liberated woman of France. She won a 1961 David di Donatello Best Foreign Actress Award for her work in &quot;The Truth&quot; (1960)&quot;.&quot; Bardot later starred in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s film &quot;Le Mépris&quot; (1963). For her role in Louis Malle&#x27;s film &quot;Viva Maria!&quot; (1965), she was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress. French President Charles de Gaulle called Bardot &quot;the French export as important as Renault cars&quot;.

After retiring from acting in 1973, Bardot became an animal rights activist and created the Brigitte Bardot Foundation. She is known for her strong personality, outspokenness, and speeches on animal defense; she has been fined twice for public insults. She has also been a controversial political figure, as of November 2021 having been fined six times for inciting racial hatred when she criticised immigration and Islam in France and called residents of Réunion &quot;savages&quot;. She is married to Bernard d&#x27;Ormale, a former adviser to Jean-Marie Le Pen, a far-right French politician. Bardot is a member of the Global 500 Roll of Honour of the United Nations Environment Programme and has received several awards and accolades from UNESCO and PETA. In 2011, &quot;Los Angeles Times Magazine&quot; ranked her second on the &quot;50 Most Beautiful Women In Film&quot;.

==Early life==
Bardot was born on 28 September 1934 in the 15th arrondissement of Paris to Louis Bardot (1896–1975) and Anne-Marie Mucel (1912–1978). Bardot&#x27;s father, who originated from Ligny-en-Barrois, was an engineer and the proprietor of several industrial factories in Paris. Her mother was the daughter of an insurance company director. She grew up in a conservative Catholic family, as had her father. She suffered from amblyopia as a child, which resulted in decreased vision of her left eye. She has one younger sister, Mijanou Bardot.

Bardot&#x27;s childhood was prosperous; she lived in her family&#x27;s seven-bedroom apartment in the luxurious 16th arrondissement. However, she recalled feeling resentful in her early years. Her father demanded that she follow strict behavioural standards, including good table manners, and wear appropriate clothes. Her mother was highly selective in choosing companions for her, so Bardot had very few childhood friends. Bardot cited a personal traumatic incident when she and her sister broke her parents&#x27; favourite vase while they were playing in the house; her father whipped the sisters 20 times and subsequently treated them like &quot;strangers&quot;, demanding that they address their parents by the formal pronoun &quot;&quot;, used in French when speaking to unfamiliar or higher-status persons outside the immediate family. The incident led to Bardot decisively resenting her parents and to her future rebellious lifestyle.

During World War II, when Paris was occupied by Nazi Germany, Bardot spent more time at home due to increasingly strict civilian surveillance. She became engrossed in dancing to records, which her mother saw as a potential for a ballet career. Bardot was admitted at the age of seven to the private school Cours Hattemer. She went to school three days a week, which gave her ample time to take dance lessons at a local studio under her mother&#x27;s arrangements. In 1949, Bardot was accepted at the Conservatoire de Paris. She attended ballet classes held by Russian choreographer Boris Knyazev for three years. She also studied at the Institut de la Tour, a private Catholic high school near her home.

Hélène Gordon-Lazareff, the director of the magazines &quot;Elle&quot; and &quot;Le Jardin des Modes&quot;, hired Bardot in 1949 as a &quot;junior&quot; fashion model. On 8 March 1950, 15-year-old Bardot appeared on the cover of &quot;Elle&quot;, which brought her an acting offer for the film &quot;Les Lauriers sont coupés&quot; from director Marc Allégret. Her parents opposed her becoming an actress, but her grandfather was supportive, saying that &quot;If this little girl is to become a whore, cinema will not be the cause.&quot; At the audition, Bardot met Roger Vadim, who later notified her that she did not get the role. They subsequently fell in love. Her parents fiercely opposed their relationship; her father announced to her one evening that she would continue her education in England and that he had bought her a train ticket for the following day. Bardot reacted by putting her head into an oven with open fire; her parents stopped her and ultimately accepted the relationship, on condition that she marry Vadim at the age of 18.

==Career==
===Beginnings: 1952–1955===
Bardot appeared on the cover of &quot;Elle&quot; again in 1952, which landed her an offer for a small part in the comedy film &quot;Crazy for Love&quot; the same year, directed by Jean Boyer and starring Bourvil. She was paid 200,000 francs (about 575 1952 US dollars) for the small role portraying a cousin of the main character. Bardot had her second film role in &quot;Manina, the Girl in the Bikini&quot; (1952), directed by Willy Rozier. She also had roles in the 1953 films &quot;The Long Teeth&quot; and &quot;His Father&#x27;s Portrait&quot;.

Bardot had a small role in a Hollywood-financed film being shot in Paris in 1953, &quot;Act of Love&quot;, starring Kirk Douglas. She received media attention when she attended the Cannes Film Festival in April 1953.
Bardot had a leading role in 1954 in an Italian melodrama, &quot;Concert of Intrigue&quot; and in a French adventure film, &quot;Caroline and the Rebels&quot;. She had a good part as a flirtatious student in the 1955 &quot;School for Love&quot;, opposite Jean Marais, for director Marc Allégret.

Bardot played her first sizeable English-language role in 1955 in &quot;Doctor at Sea&quot;, as the love interest for Dirk Bogarde. The film was the third-most-popular movie in Britain that year.

Bardot had a small role in &quot;The Grand Maneuver&quot; (1955) for director René Clair, supporting Gérard Philipe and Michelle Morgan. The part was bigger in &quot;The Light Across the Street&quot; (1956) for director Georges Lacombe. She had another in the Hollywood film &quot;Helen of Troy&quot;, playing Helen&#x27;s handmaiden.

For the Italian movie &quot;Mio figlio Nerone&quot; (1956) brunette Bardot was asked by the director to appear as a blonde. She dyed her hair rather than wear a wig; she was so pleased with the results that she decided to retain the color.

=== Rise to stardom: 1956–1962 ===
Bardot then appeared in four movies that made her a star. First up was a musical, &quot;Naughty Girl&quot; (1956), where Bardot played a troublesome school girl. Directed by Michel Boisrond, it was co-written by Roger Vadim and was a great success, going on to become the 12th most popular film of the year in France. It was followed by a comedy, &quot;Plucking the Daisy&quot; (1956), also written by Vadim. This was succeeded by &quot;The Bride Is Much Too Beautiful&quot; (1956) with Louis Jourdan.

Finally, there was the melodrama &quot;And God Created Woman&quot; (1956). The movie was Vadim&#x27;s debut as director, with Bardot starring opposite Jean-Louis Trintignant and Curt Jurgens. The film, about an immoral teenager in an otherwise respectable small-town setting, was an even larger success, not just in France but also around the world, listed among the ten most popular films in Great Britain in 1957. In the United States the film was the highest-grossing foreign film ever released, earning $4 million, which author Peter Lev describes as &quot;an astonishing amount for a foreign film at that time.&quot; It turned Bardot into an international star. From at least 1956, she was hailed as the &quot;sex kitten&quot;. The film scandalized the United States and some theater managers were even arrested just for screening it.

Paul O&#x27;Neil of &quot;Life&quot; (June 1958) in describing Bardot&#x27;s international popularity, writes:
In gaining her present eminence, Brigitte Bardot has had certain advantages beyond those she was born with. Like the European sports car, she has arrived on the American scene at a time when the American public is ready, even hungry, for something racier and more realistic than the familiar domestic product.&lt;br&gt;

During her early career, professional photographer Sam Lévin&#x27;s photos contributed to the image of Bardot&#x27;s sensuality. British photographer Cornel Lucas made images of Bardot in the 1950s and 1960s that have become representative of her public persona.

Bardot followed &quot;And God Created Woman&quot; up with &quot;La Parisienne&quot; (1957), a comedy co-starring Charles Boyer for director Boisrond. She was reunited with Vadim in another melodrama &quot;The Night Heaven Fell&quot; (1958), and played a criminal who seduced Jean Gabin in &quot;In Case of Adversity&quot; (1958). The latter was the 13th most seen movie of the year in France. In 1958, Bardot became the highest-paid actress in the country of France.

&quot;The Female&quot; (1959) for director Julien Duvivier was popular, but &quot;Babette Goes to War&quot; (1959), a comedy set in World War II, was a huge hit, the fourth biggest movie of the year in France. Also widely seen was &quot;Come Dance with Me&quot; (1959) from Boisrond.

Bardot&#x27;s next film was courtroom drama &quot;The Truth&quot; (1960), from Henri-Georges Clouzot. It was a highly publicised production, which resulted in Bardot having an affair and attempting suicide. The film was Bardot&#x27;s biggest commercial success in France, the third biggest hit of the year, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. Bardot was awarded a David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Actress for her role in the film.

She made a comedy with Vadim, &quot;Please, Not Now!&quot; (1961), and had a role in the all-star anthology, &quot;Famous Love Affairs&quot; (1962).

Bardot starred alongside Marcello Mastroianni in a film inspired by her life in &quot;A Very Private Affair&quot; (&quot;Vie privée&quot;, 1962), directed by Louis Malle. More popular than that was her role in &quot;Love on a Pillow&quot; (1962).

=== International films and singing career: 1962–1968 ===

In the mid-1960s, Bardot made films that seemed to be more aimed at the international market. She starred in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s film &quot;Le Mépris&quot; (1963), produced by Joseph E. Levine and starring Jack Palance. The following year she co-starred with Anthony Perkins in the comedy &quot;Une ravissante idiote&quot; (1964).

&quot;Dear Brigitte&quot; (1965), Bardot&#x27;s first Hollywood film, was a comedy starring James Stewart as an academic whose son develops a crush on Bardot. Bardot&#x27;s appearance was relatively brief in the film, and the movie was not a big success.

More successful was the Western buddy comedy &quot;Viva Maria!&quot; (1965) for director Louis Malle, appearing opposite Jeanne Moreau. It was a big hit in France and worldwide, although it did not break through in the United States as much as had been hoped.

After a cameo in Godard&#x27;s &quot;Masculin Féminin&quot; (1966), she had her first outright flop for some years, &quot;Two Weeks in September&quot; (1968), a French–English co-production. She had a small role in the all-star &quot;Spirits of the Dead&quot; (1968), acting opposite Alain Delon, then tried a Hollywood film again: &quot;Shalako&quot; (1968), a Western starring Sean Connery, which was another box-office disappointment.

She participated in several musical shows and recorded many popular songs in the 1960s and 1970s, mostly in collaboration with Serge Gainsbourg, Bob Zagury and Sacha Distel, including &quot;Harley Davidson&quot;; &quot;Je Me Donne À Qui Me Plaît&quot;; &quot;Bubble gum&quot;; &quot;Contact&quot;; &quot;Je Reviendrai Toujours Vers Toi&quot;; &quot;L&#x27;Appareil À Sous&quot;; &quot;La Madrague&quot;; &quot;On Déménage&quot;; &quot;Sidonie&quot;; &quot;Tu Veux, Ou Tu Veux Pas?&quot;; &quot;Le Soleil De Ma Vie&quot; (a cover of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot;); and &quot;Je t&#x27;aime... moi non-plus&quot;. Bardot pleaded with Gainsbourg not to release this duet and he complied with her wish; the following year, he rerecorded a version with British-born model and actress Jane Birkin that became a massive hit all over Europe. The version with Bardot was issued in 1986 and became a download hit in 2006 when Universal Music made its back catalogue available to purchase online, with this version of the song ranking as the third most popular download.
=== Final films: 1969–1973 ===
From 1969 to 1972, Bardot was the official face of Marianne, who had previously up until then been anonymous, to represent the liberty of France.

&quot;Her next film, Les Femmes&quot; (1969), was a flop, although the screwball comedy &quot;The Bear and the Doll&quot; (1970) performed better. Her last few films were mostly comedies: &quot;Les Novices&quot; (1970), &quot;Boulevard du Rhum&quot; (1971) (with Lino Ventura). &quot;The Legend of Frenchie King&quot; (1971) was more popular, helped by Bardot co-starring with Claudia Cardinale.

She made one more movie working with Vadim, &quot;Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman&quot; (1973), playing the title role. Vadim said the film marked &quot;Underneath what people call &#x27;the Bardot myth&#x27; was something interesting, even though she was never considered the most professional actress in the world. For years, since she has been growing older, and the Bardot myth has become just a souvenir... I was curious in her as a woman and I had to get to the end of something with her, to get out of her and express many things I felt were in her. Brigitte always gave the impression of sexual freedom – she is a completely open and free person, without any aggression. So I gave her the part of a man – that amused me&quot;.

&quot;If &quot;Don Juan&quot; is not my last movie it will be my next to last&quot;, said Bardot during filming. She kept her word and made only one more film, &quot;The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot&quot; (1973).

In 1973, Bardot announced she was retiring from acting as &quot;a way to get out elegantly&quot;.

==Animal rights activism==
Bardot met Paul Watson in 1977, the same year he founded the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, during an operation to condemn the &quot;massacre&quot; of seal pups and seal hunting on the Canadian ice floe. In support of animal protection, Bardot went to the ice floe after being invited by Watson. Bardot posed lying down next to the seal pups; the photos were seen worldwide. Bardot and Watson remained friends.

After appearing in more than 40 motion pictures and recording several music albums, Bardot used her fame to promote animal rights. In 1986, she established the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the Welfare and Protection of Animals. She became a vegetarian and raised three million francs (about 430,000 1986 US dollars) to fund the foundation by auctioning off jewellery and personal belongings.

Bardot has been a strong animal rights activist and a major opponent of the consumption of horse meat.

In 1989, while looking after her neighbour, Jean-Pierre Manivet&#x27;s donkey, the mare displayed excessive interest in Bardot&#x27;s older donkey and she subsequently had the neighbour&#x27;s donkey castrated due to concerns the mating would prove fatal for her mare. The neighbour then sued Bardot, and Bardot later won, with the court ordering Manivet to pay 20,000 francs for creating a &quot;false scandal&quot;. 

Bardot urged French television viewers to boycott horse meat and was soon the target of death threats in January 1994. Not backing off from the threats, she sent a letter to the French Minister of Agriculture, Jean Puech, calling on him to ban the sale of horse meat.

Bardot wrote a 1999 letter to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, published in French magazine &quot;VSD&quot;, in which she accused the Chinese of &quot;torturing bears and killing the world&#x27;s last tigers and rhinos to make aphrodisiacs&quot;.
She donated more than US$140,000 over two years in 2001 for a mass sterilization and adoption program for Bucharest&#x27;s stray dogs, estimated to number 300,000.

In August 2010, Bardot addressed a letter to Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, appealing for the sovereign to halt the killing of dolphins in the Faroe Islands. In the letter, Bardot describes the activity as a &quot;macabre spectacle&quot; that &quot;is a shame for Denmark and the Faroe Islands ... This is not a hunt but a mass slaughter ... an outmoded tradition that has no acceptable justification in today&#x27;s world&quot;.

On 22 April 2011, French culture minister Frédéric Mitterrand officially included bullfighting in the country&#x27;s cultural heritage. Bardot wrote him a highly critical letter of protest. On 25 May 2011, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society renamed its fast interceptor vessel, MV &quot;Gojira&quot;, as MV &quot;Brigitte Bardot&quot; in appreciation of her support.

From 2013, the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, in collaboration with Kagyupa International Monlam Trust of India, operated an annual veterinary care camp. Bardot committed to the cause of animal welfare in Bodhgaya over several years.

On 23 July 2015, Bardot condemned Australian politician Greg Hunt&#x27;s plan to eradicate 2 million cats to save endangered species such as the Warru and night parrot.

At the age of 90, Bardot appealed to free Watson, who had been detained in Greenland since 21 July 2024, when Japan requested his extradition. Through a request expressed in mid-October 2024 by her lawyers and Sea Shepherd France, Bardot asked French President Emmanuel Macron to grant Watson political asylum. Bardot asked Macron to show &quot;a little bit of courage&quot;. During that month, she initiated a demonstration in support of Watson in front of the Hôtel de Ville, Paris. Bardot also wrote a letter to Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, asking her to &quot;not choose the camp of the oceans gravediggers&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and relationships===
Bardot has been married four times, with her current marriage lasting far longer than the previous three combined. By her own count, she has had a total of 17 romantic relationships. Bardot would characteristically leave for another relationship when &quot;the present was getting lukewarm&quot;; she said, &quot;I have always looked for passion. That&#x27;s why I was often unfaithful. And when the passion was coming to an end, I was packing my suitcase&quot;.

On 20 December 1952, aged 18, Bardot married director Roger Vadim. They separated in 1956 after she became involved with &quot;And God Created Woman&quot; co-star Jean-Louis Trintignant, divorcing the next year. Trintignant at the time was married to actress Stéphane Audran. Bardot and Vadim had no children together, but remained in touch for the rest of his life and even collaborated on later projects. Bardot and Trintignant lived together for about two years, spanning the period before and after Bardot&#x27;s divorce from Vadim, but they never married. Their relationship was complicated by Trintignant&#x27;s frequent absence due to military service and Bardot&#x27;s affair with musician Gilbert Bécaud.

After her separation from Vadim, Bardot acquired a historic property dating from the 16th century, called Le Castelet, in Cannes. The fourteen-bedroom villa, surrounded by lush gardens, olive trees, and vineyards, consisted of several buildings.

In 1958, she bought a second property called La Madrague, located in Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer. In early 1958, her breakup with Trintignant was followed in quick order by a reported nervous breakdown in Italy, according to newspaper reports. A suicide attempt with sleeping pills two days earlier was also noted but was denied by her public relations manager. She recovered within weeks, began a relationship with actor Jacques Charrier, and became pregnant well before they married on 18 June 1959. Bardot&#x27;s only child, son Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, was born on 11 January 1960. Bardot had an affair with Glenn Ford in the early 1960s. After she and Charrier divorced in 1962, Nicolas was raised in the Charrier family and had little contact with his biological mother until his adulthood. Sami Frey was mentioned as the reason for her divorce from Charrier. Bardot was enamoured of Frey, but he quickly left her.
From 1963 to 1965, she lived with musician Bob Zagury.

Bardot&#x27;s third marriage was to German millionaire playboy Gunter Sachs, lasting from 14 July 1966 to 7 October 1969, though they had separated the previous year. While filming &quot;Shalako&quot;, she rejected Sean Connery&#x27;s advances; she said, &quot;It didn&#x27;t last long because I wasn&#x27;t a James Bond girl! I have never succumbed to his charm!&quot; In 1968, she began dating Patrick Gilles, who co-starred with her in &quot;The Bear and the Doll&quot; (1970); but she ended their relationship in spring 1971.

Over the next few years, Bardot dated bartender/ski instructor Christian Kalt, nightclub owner Luigi &quot;Gigi&quot; Rizzi, singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, writer John Gilmore, actor Warren Beatty, and Laurent Vergez, her co-star in &quot;Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman&quot;.

In 1974, Bardot appeared in a nude photo shoot in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, which celebrated her 40th birthday. In 1975, she entered a relationship with artist Miroslav Brozek and posed for some of his sculptures. Brozek was also an occasional actor; his stage name is . The couple lived together for four years, separating in December 1979.

From 1980 to 1985, Bardot had a live-in relationship with French TV producer . On 27 September 1983, the eve of her 49th birthday, Bardot took an overdose of sleeping pills or tranquilizers with red wine, then wandered out to the beach, where she was later pulled from the surf. She had to be rushed to the hospital, where her life was saved after a stomach pump was used to evacuate the pills from her body. Bardot was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1984. She refused to undergo chemotherapy treatment and decided only to do radiation therapy. She recovered in 1986.

Bardot&#x27;s fourth and current husband is Bernard d&#x27;Ormale; they have been married since 16 August 1992. In 2018, in an interview accorded to &quot;Le Journal du Dimanche&quot;, she denied rumors of relationships with Johnny Hallyday, Jimi Hendrix, and Mick Jagger.

===Politics and legal issues===
Bardot expressed support for President Charles de Gaulle in the 1960s.

In her 1999 book &quot;Le Carré de Pluton&quot; (&quot;Pluto&#x27;s Square&quot;), Bardot criticizes the procedure used in the ritual slaughter of sheep during the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha. Additionally, in a section in the book entitled &quot;Open Letter to My Lost France,&quot; she writes that &quot;my country, France, my homeland, my land is again invaded by an overpopulation of foreigners, especially Muslims.&quot; For this comment, a French court fined her 30,000 francs (about 4,200 US dollars in 2000) in June 2000. She had been fined in 1997 for the original publication of this open letter in &quot;Le Figaro&quot; and again in 1998 for making similar remarks.

In her 2003 book, &quot;Un cri dans le silence&quot; (&quot;A Scream in the Silence&quot;), she contrasted her close gay friends with homosexuals who &quot;jiggle their bottoms, put their little fingers in the air and with their little castrato voices moan about what those ghastly heteros put them through,&quot; and said some contemporary homosexuals behave like &quot;fairground freaks.&quot; In her own defence, Bardot wrote in a letter to a French gay magazine: &quot;Apart from my husband—who maybe will cross over one day as well—I am entirely surrounded by homos. For years, they have been my support, my friends, my adopted children, my confidants.&quot;

In her book, she criticised racial mixing, immigration, the role of women in politics and Islam. The book also contained a section attacking what she called the mixing of genes, and praised previous generations which, she said, had given their lives to push out invaders. On 10 June 2004, Bardot was convicted for a fourth time by a French court for inciting racial hatred and fined €5,000. Bardot denied the racial hatred charge and apologized in court, saying: &quot;I never knowingly wanted to hurt anybody. It is not in my character.&quot; In 2008, Bardot was convicted of inciting racial/religious hatred in regard to a letter she wrote, a copy of which she sent to Nicolas Sarkozy when he was Interior Minister of France. The letter stated her objections to Muslims in France ritually slaughtering sheep by slitting their throats without anesthetizing them first. She also said, in reference to Muslims, that she was &quot;fed up with being under the thumb of this population which is destroying us, destroying our country and imposing its habits.&quot; The trial concluded on 3 June 2008, with a conviction and fine of €15,000. The prosecutor stated she was weary of charging Bardot with offences related to racial hatred.

During the 2008 United States presidential election, Bardot branded Republican Party vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin as &quot;stupid&quot; and a &quot;disgrace to women.&quot; She criticized the former Alaskan governor for her stance on global warming and gun control. She was further offended by Palin&#x27;s support for Arctic oil exploration and by her lack of consideration in protecting polar bears.

On 13 August 2010, Bardot criticised American filmmaker Kyle Newman for his plan to produce a biographical film about her. She told him, &quot;Wait until I&#x27;m dead before you make a movie about my life!&quot; otherwise &quot;sparks will fly.&quot;

In 2014, Bardot wrote an open letter demanding the ban in France of Jewish ritual slaughter shechita. In response, the European Jewish Congress released a statement saying &quot;Bardot has once again shown her clear insensitivity for minority groups with the substance and style of her letter...She may well be concerned for the welfare of animals but her longstanding support for the far-right and for discrimination against minorities in France shows a constant disdain for human rights instead.&quot;

In 2015, Bardot threatened to sue a Saint-Tropez boutique for selling items featuring her face. In 2018, she expressed support for the Yellow vests protests.

On 19 March 2019, Bardot issued an open letter to Réunion prefect in which she accused inhabitants of the Indian Ocean island of animal cruelty and referred to them as &quot;autochthones who have kept the genes of savages&quot;. In her letter relating to animal abuse and sent through her foundation, she mentioned the &quot;beheadings of goats and billy goats&quot; during festivals, and associated these practices with &quot;reminiscences of cannibalism from past centuries&quot;. The public prosecutor filed a lawsuit the following day.

In June 2021, 86-year-old Bardot was fined €5,000 by the Arras court for public insults against hunters and their national president . She had published a post at the end of 2019 on her foundation&#x27;s website, calling hunters &quot;sub-men&quot; and &quot;drunkards&quot; and carriers of &quot;genes of cruel barbarism inherited from our primitive ancestors&quot;, and insulting Schraen. At the time of the hearing, she had not removed the comments from the website. Following her letter sent to the prefect of Réunion in 2019, she was convicted on 4 November 2021 by a French court for public insults and fined €20,000, the largest of her fines to date.

Bardot&#x27;s husband Bernard d&#x27;Ormale is a former adviser to Jean-Marie Le Pen, former leader of the far-right party National Front (which became National Rally), the main far-right party in France. Bardot expressed support for Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front (National Rally), calling her &quot;the Joan of Arc of the 21st century&quot;. She endorsed Le Pen in the 2012 and 2017 French presidential elections.

Bardot has been convicted of inciting racial hatred multiple times, having received six separate fines for the offense as of November 2021.

==Legacy==

&quot;The Guardian&quot; named Bardot &quot;one of the most iconic faces, models, and actors of the 1950s and 1960s&quot;. She has been called a &quot;style icon&quot; and a &quot;muse for Dior, Balmain, and Pierre Cardin&quot;.

In fashion, the Bardot neckline (a wide-open neck that exposes both shoulders) is named after her. Bardot popularized this style, which is especially used for knitted sweaters or jumpers, although it is also used for other tops and dresses. Bardot popularized the bikini in her early films such as &quot;Manina&quot; (1952) (released in France as &quot;Manina, la fille sans voiles&quot;). The following year she was also photographed in a bikini on every beach in southern France during the Cannes Film Festival. She gained additional attention when she filmed &quot;...And God Created Woman&quot; (1956) with Jean-Louis Trintignant (released in France as &quot;Et Dieu Créa La Femme&quot;). In it Bardot portrays an immoral teenager cavorting in a bikini who seduces men in a respectable small-town setting. The film was an international success. Bardot&#x27;s image was linked to the shoemaker Repetto, who created a pair of ballerinas for her in 1956. The bikini was in the 1950s relatively well accepted in France but was still considered risqué in the United States. As late as 1959, Anne Cole, one of the United States&#x27; largest swimsuit designers, said, &quot;It&#x27;s nothing more than a G-string. It&#x27;s at the razor&#x27;s edge of decency.&quot;

She also brought into fashion the () hairstyle (similar to the beehive hair style) and gingham clothes after wearing a checkered pink dress, designed by Jacques Esterel, at her wedding to Charrier. French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir described Bardot as &quot;a locomotive of women&#x27;s history&quot;.

Isabella Biedenharn of &quot;Elle&quot; wrote that Bardot &quot;has inspired thousands (millions?) of women to tease their hair or try out winged eyeliner over the past few decades&quot;. A well-known evocative pose describes an iconic modelling portrait shot around 1960 where Bardot is dressed only in a pair of black pantyhose, cross-legged over her front and cross-armed over her breasts; known as the &quot;Bardot Pose&quot;. This pose has been emulated numerous times by models and celebrities such as Lindsay Lohan, Elle Macpherson, Gisele Bündchen, and Rihanna. In the late 1960s, Bardot&#x27;s silhouette was used as a model for designing and modelling the statue&#x27;s bust of Marianne, a symbol of the French Republic.

In addition to popularizing the bikini swimming suit, Bardot has been credited with popularizing the city of St. Tropez and the town of Armação dos Búzios in Brazil, which she visited in 1964 with her boyfriend at the time, Brazilian musician Bob Zagury. The place where she stayed in Búzios is today a small hotel, Pousada do Sol, and also a French restaurant, Cigalon. The town hosts a Bardot statue by Christina Motta.

Bardot was idolized by the young John Lennon and Paul McCartney. They made plans to shoot a film featuring The Beatles and Bardot, similar to &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, but the plans were never fulfilled. Lennon&#x27;s first wife Cynthia Powell lightened her hair colour to more closely resemble Bardot, while George Harrison made comparisons between Bardot and his first wife Pattie Boyd, as Cynthia wrote later in &quot;A Twist of Lennon&quot;. Lennon and Bardot met in person once, in 1968 at the May Fair Hotel, introduced by Beatles press agent Derek Taylor; a nervous Lennon took LSD before arriving, and neither star impressed the other. Lennon recalled in a memoir: &quot;I was on acid, and she was on her way out.&quot; According to the liner notes of his first (self-titled) album, musician Bob Dylan dedicated the first song he ever wrote to Bardot. He also mentioned her by name in &quot;I Shall Be Free&quot;, which appeared on his second album, &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot;. The first-ever official exhibition spotlighting Bardot&#x27;s influence and legacy opened in Boulogne-Billancourt on 29 September 2009 – a day after her 75th birthday. 

Bardot was the subject of eight Andy Warhol paintings in 1974.

The Australian pop group Bardot was named after her.

Kylie Minogue adopted the Bardot &quot;sex kitten look&quot; on the cover of her album &quot;Body Language&quot;, released in 2003.

Women who emulated and were inspired by Bardot include Claudia Schiffer, Emmanuelle Béart, Elke Sommer, Kate Moss, Faith Hill, Isabelle Adjani, Diane Kruger, Lara Stone, Minogue, Amy Winehouse, Georgia May Jagger, Zahia Dehar, Scarlett Johansson, Louise Bourgoin, and Paris Hilton. Bardot said: &quot;None have my personality.&quot; Laetitia Casta embodied Bardot in the 2010 French drama film &quot;&quot; by Joann Sfar.

In 2011, &quot;Los Angeles Times Magazine&quot;″s list of &quot;50 Most Beautiful Women in Film&quot; ranked her number two.

A portrait of Bardot by Warhol, commissioned by Sachs in 1974, was sold at Sotheby&#x27;s in London on 22 and 23 May 2012. The painting, estimated at  million, was part of Sachs&#x27; art collection put on sale a year after his death.

She inspired Nicole Kidman, who had &quot;Bardot-esque&quot; hair in the 2013 British brand Jimmy Choo campaign.

In 2015, Bardot was ranked number six in &quot;The Top Ten Most Beautiful Women of All Time&quot;, according to a survey carried out by Amway&#x27;s beauty company in the UK involving 2,000 women.

In 2020, &quot;Vogue&quot; named Bardot number one of &quot;The most beautiful French actresses of all time&quot;. In a retrospective retracing women throughout the history of cinema, she was listed among &quot;the most accomplished, talented and beautiful actresses of all time&quot; by &quot;Glamour&quot;.

The French drama television series &quot;Bardot&quot; was broadcast on France 2 in 2023. It stars Julia de Nunez and is about Bardot&#x27;s career from her first casting at age 15 and until the filming of &quot;La Vérité&quot; ten years later. In 2023, she was mentioned in Olivia Rodrigo&#x27;s song &quot;Lacy&quot; from her album &quot;Guts&quot;, and Chappell Roan&#x27;s &quot;Red Wine Supernova&quot; from her album &quot;The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess&quot;.

<text>The banjo is a stringed instrument with a thin membrane stretched over a frame or cavity to form a resonator. The membrane is typically circular, and in modern forms is usually made of plastic, where early membranes were made of animal skin. 

Early forms of the instrument were fashioned by African Americans and had African antecedents. In the 19th century, interest in the instrument was spread across the United States and United Kingdom by traveling shows of the 19th-century minstrel show fad, followed by mass production and mail-order sales, including instructional books. The inexpensive or home-made banjo remained part of rural folk culture, but 5-string and 4-string banjos also became popular for home parlor music entertainment, college music clubs, and early 20th century jazz bands. By the early 20th century, the banjo was most frequently associated with folk, bluegrass and country music, but was also used in some rock, pop and even hip-hop music. Among rock bands, the Eagles, Led Zeppelin, and the Grateful Dead have used the five-string banjo in some of their songs. Some famous pickers of the banjo are Ralph Stanley and Earl Scruggs.

Historically, the banjo occupied a central place in Black American traditional music and rural folk culture before entering the mainstream via the minstrel shows of the 19th century. Along with the fiddle, the banjo is a mainstay of American styles of music, such as bluegrass and old-time music. It is also very frequently used in Dixieland jazz, as well as in Caribbean genres like biguine, calypso, mento and troubadour.

==History==

===Early origins===

The modern banjo derives from instruments that have been recorded to be in use in North America and the Caribbean since the 17th century by enslaved people taken from West and Central Africa, such as the kora. Their African-style instruments were crafted from split gourds with animal skins stretched across them. Strings, from gut or vegetable fibers, were attached to a wooden neck. Written references to the banjo in North America and the Caribbean appear in the 17th and 18th centuries.

The earliest written indication of an instrument akin to the banjo is in the 17th century: Richard Jobson (1621) in describing The Gambia, wrote about an instrument like the banjo, which he called a &quot;bandore&quot;.

The term &quot;banjo&quot; has several etymological origins. One theory links it to the Mandinka language which gives the name of Banjul, capital of The Gambia. Another claim is a connection to the West African &quot;akonting&quot;: it is made with a long bamboo neck called a &quot;bangoe&quot;. The material for the neck, called &quot;ban julo&quot; in the Mandinka language, again gives &quot;banjul&quot;. In this interpretation, &quot;banjul&quot; became a sort of eponym for the akonting as it crossed the Atlantic. The instrument&#x27;s name might also derive from the Kimbundu word &quot;mbanza&quot;, which is a loan word to the Portuguese language resulting in the term &quot;banza&quot;, which was used by early French travelers in the Americas. Its earliest recorded use was in 1678 by the Sovereign Council of Martinique which reinstated a 1654 decree that placed prohibitions and restrictions on &quot;dances and assemblies of negroes&quot; deemed to be &quot;kalenda&quot;, which was defined as the gathering of enslaved Africans who danced to the sound of a drum and an instrument called the banza.

The OED claims that the term &quot;banjo&quot; comes from a dialectal pronunciation of Portuguese &quot;bandore&quot; or from an early anglicisation of Spanish &quot;bandurria&quot;. Contrary evidence shows that the terms &quot;bandore&quot; and &quot;bandurria&quot; were used when Europeans encountered the instrument or its kin varieties in use by people of African descent, who used names for the instrument such as &quot;banza&quot;, as it was called in places such as Haiti, varieties that were built around a gourd body with a wooden plank for the neck. François Richard de Tussac, a former planter from Saint-Domingue, details its construction in the book &quot;Le Cri des Colons&quot;, published in 1810, stating:

As for the guitars, which the negroes call &quot;banzas&quot;, this is what they consist of: they cut lengthwise, through the middle, a fresh calabash [the fruit of a tree called the callebassier]. This fruit is sometimes eight inches or more in diameter. The stretch across it the skin of a goat, which they attach on the edges with little nails; they put two or three little holes on this surface, and then a kind of plank or piece of wood that is rudely flattened makes the neck of the instrument; they stretch three strings made of pitre [a kind of string taken from the agave plant, commonly known as pitre] across it; and so the instrument is built. On this instrument they play airs composed of three or four notes, which they repeat constantly.

Michel Étienne Descourtilz, a naturalist who visited Haiti in the early 1800s, described it as &quot;banzas&quot;, a Negro instrument, that the natives prepare by sawing one of the calabashes or a large gourd lengthwise, to which they attach a neck and sonorous strings made from the filament&quot; of aloe plants. It was played during any occasion, from boredom to joyous parties and calendas to funeral ceremonies. It was the custom to also combine this sound with the more noisy &quot;bamboula&quot;, a type of drum made from a stick of bamboo covered on both sides with a skin that was played with fingers and knuckles while sitting astride.

Various instruments in Africa, chief among them the &quot;kora&quot;, feature a skin drumhead and gourd (or similar shell) body. These instruments differ from early African-American banjos in that the necks do not possess a Western-style fingerboard and tuning pegs; instead they have stick necks, with strings attached to the neck with loops for tuning.

Another likely relative of the banjo is the aforementioned &quot;akonting&quot;, a spike folk lute which is constructed using a gourd body, a long wooden neck, and three strings played by the Jola tribe of Senegambia, and the &quot;ubaw-akwala&quot; of the Igbo. Similar instruments include the &quot;xalam&quot; of Senegal and the &quot;ngoni&quot; of the Wassoulou region that includes parts of Mali, Guinea, and Ivory Coast, as well as a larger variation of the &quot;ngoni&quot;, known as the &quot;gimbri&quot;, developed in Morocco by sub-Saharan Africans (Gnawa or Haratin).

Banjo-like instruments seem to have been independently invented in several different places, in addition to the many African instruments mentioned above, since instruments similar to the banjo are known from a diverse array of distant countries. For example, the Chinese &quot;sanxian&quot;, the Japanese &quot;shamisen&quot;, the Persian &quot;tar&quot;, and the Moroccan &quot;sintir&quot;.

Banjos with fingerboards and tuning pegs are known from the Caribbean as early as the 17th century. Some 18th- and early 19th-century writers transcribed the name of these instruments variously as &quot;bangie&quot;, &quot;banza&quot;, &quot;bonjaw&quot;, &quot;banjer&quot; and &quot;banjar&quot;.

The instrument became increasingly available commercially from around the second quarter of the 19th century due to minstrel show performances.

===Minstrel era, 1830s–1870s===

In the antebellum South, many enslaved Africans played the banjo, spreading it to the rest of the population. In his memoir &quot;With Sabre and Scalpel: The Autobiography of a Soldier and Surgeon&quot;, the Confederate veteran and surgeon John Allan Wyeth recalls learning to play the banjo as a child from an enslaved person on his family plantation. Another man who learned to play from African-Americans, probably in the 1820s, was Joel Walker Sweeney, a minstrel performer from Appomattox Court House, Virginia. Sweeney has been credited with adding a string to the four-string African-American banjo, and popularizing the five-string banjo. Although Robert McAlpin Williamson is the first documented white banjoist, in the 1830s Sweeney became the first white performer to play the banjo on stage. Sweeney&#x27;s musical performances occurred at the beginning of the minstrel era, as banjos shifted away from being exclusively homemade folk instruments to instruments of a more modern style. Sweeney participated in this transition by encouraging drum maker William Boucher of Baltimore to make banjos commercially for him to sell.

In 1949, Arthur Woodward credited Sweeney with replacing the gourd with a wooden sound box covered in skin, and adding a short fifth string around 1831. However, modern scholar Gene Bluestein pointed out in 1964 that Sweeney may not have originated either the 5th string or sound box. This new banjo was at first tuned d&#x27;Gdf♯a, though by the 1890s, this had been transposed up to g&#x27;cgbd&#x27;. Banjos were introduced in Britain by Sweeney&#x27;s group, the American Virginia Minstrels, in the 1840s, and became very popular in music halls.

The instrument grew in popularity during the 1840s after Sweeney began his traveling minstrel show. By the end of the 1840s the instrument had expanded from Caribbean possession to take root in places across America and across the Atlantic in England. It was estimated in 1866 that there were probably 10,000 banjos in New York City, up from only a handful in 1844. People were exposed to banjos not only at minstrel shows, but also medicine shows, Wild-West shows, variety shows, and traveling vaudeville shows. The banjo&#x27;s popularity also was given a boost by the Civil War, as servicemen on both sides in the Army or Navy were exposed to the banjo played in minstrel shows and by other servicemen. A popular movement of aspiring banjoists began as early as 1861. The enthusiasm for the instrument was labeled a &quot;banjo craze&quot; or &quot;banjo mania.&quot;
By the 1850s, aspiring banjo players had options to help them learn their instrument. There were more teachers teaching banjo basics in the 1850s than there had been in the 1840s. There were also instruction manuals and, for those who could read it, printed music in the manuals. The first book of notated music was &quot;The Complete Preceptor&quot; by Elias Howe, published under the pseudonym &quot;Gumbo Chaff&quot;, consisting mainly of Christy&#x27;s Minstrels tunes. The first banjo method was the &quot;Briggs&#x27; Banjo instructor&quot; (1855) by Tom Briggs. Other methods included &quot;Howe&#x27;s New American Banjo School&quot; (1857), and &quot;Phil Rice&#x27;s Method for the Banjo, With or Without a Master&quot; (1858). These books taught the &quot;stroke style&quot; or &quot;banjo style&quot;, similar to modern &quot;frailing&quot; or &quot;clawhammer&quot; styles.

By 1868, music for the banjo was available printed in a magazine, when J. K. Buckley wrote and arranged popular music for &quot;Buckley&#x27;s Monthly Banjoist&quot;. Frank B. Converse also published his entire collection of compositions in &quot;The Complete Banjoist&quot; in 1868, which included &quot;polkas, waltzes, marches, and clog hornpipes.&quot;

In the 1840s, opportunities for work were found not only in minstrel companies and circuses, but also in floating theaters and variety theaters, which served as precursors to the variety show and vaudeville.

===Classic era, 1880s–1910s===
The term &quot;classic banjo&quot; is used today to talk about a bare-finger &quot;guitar style&quot; that was widely in use among banjo players of the late 19th to early 20th century. It is still used by banjoists today. The term also differentiates that style of playing from the fingerpicking bluegrass banjo styles, such as the Scruggs style and Keith style.

The &quot;Briggs Banjo Method&quot;, considered to be the first banjo method and which taught the &quot;stroke style&quot; of playing, also mentioned the existence of another way of playing, the &quot;guitar style.&quot; Alternatively known as &quot;finger style&quot;, the new way of playing the banjo displaced the stroke method, until by 1870 it was the dominant style. Although mentioned by Briggs, it wasn&#x27;t taught. The first banjo method to teach the technique was &quot;Frank B. Converse&#x27;s New and Complete Method for the Banjo with or without a Master&quot;, published in 1865.

To play in guitar style, players use the thumb and two or three fingers on their right hand to pick the notes. Samuel Swaim Stewart summarized the style in 1888, saying,

The banjo, although popular, carried low-class associations from its role in blackface minstrel shows, medicine shows, tent shows, and variety shows or vaudeville. There was a push in the 19th century to bring the instrument into &quot;respectability.&quot; Musicians such as William A. Huntley made an effort to &quot;elevate&quot; the instrument or make it more &quot;artistic,&quot; by &quot;bringing it to a more sophisticated level of technique and repertoire based on European standards.&quot; Huntley may have been the first white performer to successfully make the transition from performing in blackface to being himself on stage, noted by the Boston Herald in November 1884. He was supported by another former blackface performer, Samuel Swaim Stewart, in his corporate magazine that popularized highly talented professionals.

As the &quot;raucous&quot; imitations of plantation life decreased in minstrelsy, the banjo became more acceptable as an instrument of fashionable society, even to be accepted into women&#x27;s parlors. Part of that change was a switch from the stroke style to the guitar playing style. An 1888 newspaper said, &quot;All the maidens and a good many of the women also strum the instrument, banjo classes abound on every side and banjo recitals are among the newest diversions of fashion...Youths and elderly men too have caught the fever...the star strummers among men are in demand at the smartest parties and have the choosing of the society of the most charming girls.&quot;

Some of those entertainers, such as Alfred A. Farland, specialized in classical music. However, musicians who wanted to entertain their audiences, and make a living, mixed it in with the popular music that audiences wanted. Farland&#x27;s pupil Frederick J. Bacon was one of these. A former medicine show entertainer, Bacon performed classical music along with popular songs such as &quot;Massa&#x27;s in de cold, cold ground&quot;, a &quot;Medley of Scotch Airs&quot;, a &quot;Medley of Southern Airs&quot;, and Thomas Glynn’s &quot;West Lawn Polka&quot;.

Banjo innovation which began in the minstrel age continued, with increased use of metal parts, exotic wood, raised metal frets and a tone-ring that improved the sound. Instruments were designed in a variety of sizes and pitch ranges, to play different parts in banjo orchestras. Examples on display in the museum include banjorines and piccolo banjos.

New styles of playing, a new look, instruments in a variety of pitch ranges to take the place of different sections in an orchestra – all helped to separate the instrument from the rough minstrel image of the previous 50–60 years. The instrument was modern now, a bright new thing, with polished metal sides.

===Ragtime era (1895–1919) and Jazz Age era (1910s–1930s)===
In the early 1900s, new banjos began to spread, four-string models, played with a plectrum rather than with the minstrel-banjo clawhammer stroke or the classic-banjo fingerpicking style. The new banjos were a result of changing musical tastes. New music spurred the creation of &quot;evolutionary variations&quot; of the banjo, from the five-string model current since the 1830s to newer four-string plectrum and tenor banjos.

The instruments became ornately decorated in the 1920s to be visually dynamic to a theater audience. The instruments were increasingly modified or made in a new style – necks that were shortened to handle the four steel (not fiber as before) strings, strings that were sounded with a pick instead of fingers, four strings instead of five and tuned differently. The changes reflected the nature of post-World-War-I music. The country was turning away from European classics, preferring the &quot;upbeat and carefree feel&quot; of jazz, and American soldiers returning from the war helped to drive this change.

The change in tastes toward dance music and the need for louder instruments began a few years before the war, however, with ragtime. That music encouraged musicians to alter their 5-string banjos to four, add the louder steel strings and use a pick or plectrum, all in an effort to be heard over the brass and reed instruments that were current in dance-halls. The four string plectrum and tenor banjos did not eliminate the five-string variety. They were products of their times and musical purposes—ragtime and jazz dance music and theater music.

The Great Depression is a visible line to mark the end of the Jazz Age. The economic downturn cut into the sales of both four- and five-stringed banjos, and by World War 2, banjos were in sharp decline, the market for them dead.

===Modern era===
In the years after World War II, the banjo experienced a resurgence, played by music stars such as Earl Scruggs (bluegrass), Bela Fleck (jazz, rock, world music), Gerry O&#x27;Connor (Celtic and Irish music), Perry Bechtel (jazz, big band), Pete Seeger (folk), and Otis Taylor (African-American roots, blues, jazz).

Pete Seeger &quot;was a major force behind a new national interest in folk music.&quot; Learning to play a fingerstyle in the Appalachians from musicians who never stopped playing the banjo, he wrote the book, &quot;How to Play the Five-String Banjo&quot;, which was the only banjo method on the market for years. He was followed by a movement of folk musicians, such as Dave Guard of The Kingston Trio and Erik Darling of the Weavers and Tarriers.

Earl Scruggs was seen both as a legend and a &quot;contemporary musical innovator&quot; who gave his name to his style of playing, the &quot;Scruggs Style&quot;. Scruggs played the banjo &quot;with heretofore unheard of speed and dexterity,&quot; using a picking technique for the 5-string banjo that he perfected from 2-finger and 3-finger picking techniques in rural North Carolina. His playing reached Americans through the Grand Ole Opry and into the living rooms of Americans who didn&#x27;t listen to country or bluegrass music, through the theme music of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; TV sitcom.

For the last one hundred years, the tenor banjo has become an intrinsic part of the world of Irish traditional music. It is a relative newcomer to the genre.

The banjo has also been used more recently in the hardcore punk scene, most notably by Show Me the Body on their debut album, &quot;Body War&quot;.

== Technique ==

Two techniques closely associated with the five-string banjo are rolls and drones. Rolls are right hand accompanimental fingering patterns that consist of eight (eighth) notes that subdivide each measure. Drone notes are quick little notes [typically eighth notes], usually played on the 5th (short) string to fill in around the melody notes [typically eighth notes]. These techniques are both idiomatic to the banjo in all styles, and their sound is characteristic of bluegrass.

Historically, the banjo was played in the claw-hammer style by the Africans who brought their version of the banjo with them. Several other styles of play were developed from this. Clawhammer consists of downward striking of one or more of the four main strings with the index, middle or both fingers while the drone or fifth string is played with a &#x27;lifting&#x27; (as opposed to downward pluck) motion of the thumb. The notes typically sounded by the thumb in this fashion are, usually, on the off beat. Melodies can be quite intricate adding techniques such as double thumbing and drop thumb. In old time Appalachian Mountain music, a style called two-finger up-pick is also used, and a three-finger version that Earl Scruggs developed into the &quot;Scruggs&quot; style picking was nationally aired in 1945 on the Grand Ole Opry. In this style the instrument is played by plucking individual notes. Modern fingerstyle is usually played using fingerpicks, though early players and some modern players play either with nails or with a technique known as on the flesh. In this style the strings are played directly with the fingers, rather than any pick or intermediary.

While five-string banjos are traditionally played with either fingerpicks or the fingers themselves, tenor banjos and plectrum banjos are played with a pick, either to strum full chords, or most commonly in Irish traditional music, play single-note melodies.

== Modern forms ==
The modern banjo comes in a variety of forms, including four- and five-string versions. A six-string version, tuned and played similarly to a guitar, has gained popularity. In almost all of its forms, banjo playing is characterized by a fast arpeggiated plucking, though many different playing styles exist.

The body, or &quot;pot&quot;, of a modern banjo typically consists of a circular rim (generally made of wood, though metal was also common on older banjos) and a tensioned head, similar to a drum head. Traditionally, the head was made from animal skin, but today is often made of various synthetic materials. Most modern banjos also have a metal &quot;tone ring&quot; assembly that helps further clarify and project the sound, but many older banjos do not include a tone ring.

The banjo is usually tuned with friction tuning pegs or planetary gear tuners, rather than the worm gear machine head used on guitars. Frets have become standard since the late 19th century, though fretless banjos are still manufactured and played by those wishing to execute glissando, play quarter tones, or otherwise achieve the sound and feeling of early playing styles.

Modern banjos are typically strung with metal strings. Usually, the fourth string is wound with either steel or bronze-phosphor alloy. Some players may string their banjos with nylon or gut strings to achieve a more mellow, old-time tone.

Some banjos have a separate resonator plate on the back of the pot to project the sound forward and give the instrument more volume. This type of banjo is usually used in bluegrass music, though resonator banjos are played by players of all styles, and are also used in old-time, sometimes as a substitute for electric amplification when playing in large venues.

Open-back banjos generally have a mellower tone and weigh less than resonator banjos. They usually have a different setup than a resonator banjo, often with a higher string action.

=== Five-string banjo === 
The modern five-string banjo is a variation on Sweeney&#x27;s original design. The fifth string is usually the same gauge as the first, but starts from the fifth fret, three-quarters the length of the other strings. This lets the string be tuned to a higher open pitch than possible for the full-length strings. Because of the short fifth string, the five-string banjo uses a reentrant tuning – the string pitches do not proceed lowest to highest across the fingerboard. Instead, the fourth string is lowest, then third, second, first, and the fifth string is highest.

The short fifth string presents special problems for a capo. For small changes (going up or down one or two semitones, for example), simply retuning the fifth string is possible. Otherwise, various devices called &quot;fifth-string capos&quot; effectively shorten the vibrating part of the string. Many banjo players use model-railroad spikes or titanium spikes (usually installed at the seventh fret and sometimes at others), under which they hook the string to press it down on the fret.

Five-string banjo players use many tunings. (Tunings are given in left-to-right order, as viewed from the front of the instrument with the neck pointing up for a right-handed instrument. Left handed instruments reverse the order of the strings.) Probably the most common, particularly in bluegrass, is the Open-G tuning G4 D3 G3 B3 D4. In earlier times, the tuning G4 C3 G3 B3 D4 was commonly used instead, and this is still the preferred tuning for some types of folk music and for classic banjo. Other tunings found in old-time music include double C (G4 C3 G3 C4 D4), &quot;sawmill&quot; (G4 D3 G3 C4 D4) also called &quot;mountain modal&quot; and open D (F#4 D3 F#3 A3 D4). These tunings are often taken up a tone, either by tuning up or using a capo. For example, &quot;double-D&quot; tuning (A4 D3 A3 D4 E4) – commonly reached by tuning up from double C – is often played to accompany fiddle tunes in the key of D, and Open-A (A4 E3 A3 C#4 E4) is usually used for playing tunes in the key of A. Dozens of other banjo tunings are used, mostly in old-time music. These tunings are used to make playing specific tunes easier, usually fiddle tunes or groups of fiddle tunes.

The size of the five-string banjo is largely standardized, with a scale length of , but smaller and larger sizes exist, including the long-neck or &quot;Seeger neck&quot; variation designed by Pete Seeger. Petite variations on the five-string banjo have been available since the 1890s. S.S. Stewart introduced the banjeaurine, tuned one fourth above a standard five-string. Piccolo banjos are smaller, and tuned one octave above a standard banjo. Between these sizes and standard lies the A-scale banjo, which is two frets shorter and usually tuned one full step above standard tunings. Many makers have produced banjos of other scale lengths, and with various innovations.

American old-time music typically uses the five-string, open-back banjo. It is played in a number of different styles, the most common being clawhammer or frailing, characterized by the use of a downward rather than upward stroke when striking the strings with a fingernail. Frailing techniques use the thumb to catch the fifth string for a drone after most strums or after each stroke (&quot;double thumbing&quot;), or to pick out additional melody notes in what is known as drop-thumb. Pete Seeger popularized a folk style by combining clawhammer with up picking, usually without the use of fingerpicks. Another common style of old-time banjo playing is fingerpicking banjo or classic banjo. This style is based upon parlor-style guitar.

Bluegrass music, which uses the five-string resonator banjo almost exclusively, is played in several common styles. These include Scruggs style, named after Earl Scruggs; melodic, or Keith style, named for Bill Keith; and three-finger style with single-string work, also called Reno style after Don Reno. In these styles, the emphasis is on arpeggiated figures played in a continuous eighth-note rhythm, known as rolls. All of these styles are typically played with fingerpicks.

The first five-string, electric, solid-body banjo was developed by Charles Wilburn (Buck) Trent, Harold &quot;Shot&quot; Jackson, and David Jackson in 1960.

The five-string banjo has been used in classical music since before the turn of the 20th century. Contemporary and modern works have been written or arranged for the instrument by Don Vappie, Jerry Garcia, Buck Trent, Béla Fleck, Tony Trischka, Ralph Stanley, George Gibson, Steve Martin, Clifton Hicks, George Crumb, Tim Lake, Modest Mouse, Jo Kondo, Paul Elwood, Hans Werner Henze (notably in his &quot;Sixth Symphony&quot;), Daniel Mason, Beck, the Water Tower Bucket Boys, Todd Taylor, J.P. Pickens, Peggy Honeywell, Norfolk &amp; Western, Putnam Smith, Iron &amp; Wine, The Avett Brothers, The Well Pennies, Punch Brothers, Julian Koster, Sufjan Stevens, and Sarah Jarosz.

George Gershwin includes a banjo in his opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;

Frederick Delius wrote for a banjo in his opera &quot;Koanga&quot;.

Ernst Krenek includes two banjos in his &quot;Kleine Symphonie&quot; (&quot;Little Symphony&quot;).

Kurt Weill has a banjo in his opera &quot;The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot;.

Viktor Ullmann included a tenor banjo part in his &quot;Piano Concerto&quot; (op. 25).

Virgil Thomson includes a banjo in his orchestral music to accompany the film &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; (1936).

===Four-string banjos===

The four-string plectrum banjo is a standard banjo without the short drone string. It usually has 22 frets on the neck and a scale length of 26 to 28 inches, and was originally tuned C3 G3 B3 D4. It can also be tuned like the top four strings of a guitar, which is known as &quot;Chicago tuning&quot;. As the name suggests, it is usually played with a guitar-style pick (that is, a single one held between thumb and forefinger), unlike the five-string banjo, which is either played with a thumbpick and two fingerpicks, or with bare fingers. The plectrum banjo evolved out of the five-string banjo, to cater to styles of music involving strummed chords. The plectrum is also featured in many early jazz recordings and arrangements.

Four-string banjos can be used for chordal accompaniment (as in early jazz), for single-string melody playing (as in Irish traditional music), in &quot;chord melody&quot; style (a succession of chords in which the highest notes carry the melody), in tremolo style (both on chords and single strings), and a mixed technique called duo style that combines single-string tremolo and rhythm chords.

Four-string banjos are used from time to time in musical theater. Examples include: &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, &quot;Mame&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot;, &quot;Annie&quot;, &quot;Barnum&quot;, &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Spamalot&quot;, and countless others. Joe Raposo had used it variably in the imaginative seven-piece orchestration for the long-running TV show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and has sometimes had it overdubbed with itself or an electric guitar. The banjo is still (albeit rarely) in use in the show&#x27;s arrangement currently.

====Tenor banjo====
The shorter-necked, tenor banjo, with 17 (&quot;short scale&quot;) or 19 frets, is also typically played with a plectrum. It became a popular instrument after about 1910. Early models used for melodic picking typically had 17 frets on the neck and a scale length of 19 to 21 inches. By the mid-1920s, when the instrument was used primarily for strummed chordal accompaniment, 19-fret necks with a scale length of 21 to 23 inches became standard. The usual tuning is the all-fifths tuning C3 G3 D4 A4, in which exactly seven semitones (a perfect fifth) occur between the open notes of consecutive strings; this is identical to the tuning of a viola. Other players (particularly in Irish traditional music) tune the banjo G2 D3 A3 E4 like an octave mandolin, which lets the banjoist duplicate fiddle and mandolin fingering. The popularization of this tuning is usually attributed to the late Barney McKenna, banjoist with The Dubliners.

The tenor banjo was a common rhythm instrument in early 20th-century dance bands. Its volume and timbre suited early jazz (and jazz-influenced popular music styles) and could both compete with other instruments (such as brass instruments and saxophones) and be heard clearly on acoustic recordings. George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, in Ferde Grofe&#x27;s original jazz-orchestra arrangement, includes tenor banjo, with widely spaced chords not easily playable on plectrum banjo in its conventional tunings. With development of the archtop and electric guitar, the tenor banjo largely disappeared from jazz and popular music, though keeping its place in traditional &quot;Dixieland&quot; jazz.

Some 1920s Irish banjo players picked out the melodies of jigs, reels, and hornpipes on tenor banjos, decorating the tunes with snappy triplet ornaments. The most important Irish banjo player of this era was Mike Flanagan of the New York-based Flanagan Brothers, one of the most popular Irish-American groups of the day. Other pre-WWII Irish banjo players included Neil Nolan, who recorded with Dan Sullivan&#x27;s Shamrock Band in Boston, and Jimmy McDade, who recorded with the Four Provinces Orchestra in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, in Ireland, the rise of &quot;ceili&quot; bands provided a new market for a loud instrument like the tenor banjo. Use of the tenor banjo in Irish music has increased greatly since the folk revival of the 1960s.

===Six-string banjos===

The six-string banjo began as a British innovation by William Temlett, one of England&#x27;s earliest banjo makers. He opened a shop in London in 1846, and sold seven-string banjos which he marketed as &quot;zither&quot; banjos from his 1869 patent. A zither banjo usually has a closed back and sides with the drum body and skin tensioning system suspended inside the wooden rim, the neck and string tailpiece mounted on the outside of the rim, and the drone string led through a tube in the neck so that the tuning peg can be mounted on the head. They were often made by builders who used guitar tuners that came in banks of three, so five-stringed instruments had a redundant tuner; these banjos could be somewhat easily converted over to a six-string banjo.

American Alfred Davis Cammeyer (1862–1949), a young violinist turned concert banjo player, devised the six-string zither banjo around 1880. British opera diva Adelina Patti advised Cammeyer that the zither banjo might be popular with English audiences as it had been invented there, and Cammeyer went to London in 1888. With his virtuoso playing, he helped show that banjos could make more sophisticated music than normally played by blackface minstrels. He was soon performing for London society, where he met Sir Arthur Sullivan, who recommended that Cammeyer progress from arranging the music of others for banjo to composing his own music.

Modern six-string bluegrass banjos have been made. These add a bass string between the lowest string and the drone string on a five-string banjo, and are usually tuned G4 G2 D3 G3 B3 D4. Sonny Osborne played one of these instruments for several years. It was modified by luthier Rual Yarbrough from a Vega five-string model. A picture of Sonny with this banjo appears in Pete Wernick&#x27;s &quot;Bluegrass Banjo&quot; method book.

Six-string banjos known as banjo guitars basically consist of a six-string guitar neck attached to a bluegrass or plectrum banjo body, which allows players who have learned the guitar to play a banjo sound without having to relearn fingerings. This was the instrument of the early jazz great Johnny St. Cyr, jazzmen Django Reinhardt, Danny Barker, Papa Charlie Jackson and Clancy Hayes, as well as the blues and gospel singer Reverend Gary Davis. Today, musicians as diverse as Keith Urban, Rod Stewart, Taj Mahal, Joe Satriani, David Hidalgo, Larry Lalonde and Doc Watson play the six-string guitar banjo. They have become increasingly popular since the mid-1990s.

==Other banjos==
===Low banjos===

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in vogue in plucked-string instrument ensembles – guitar orchestras, mandolin orchestras, banjo orchestras – was when the instrumentation was made to parallel that of the string section in symphony orchestras. Thus, &quot;violin, viola, &#x27;cello, bass&quot; became &quot;mandolin, mandola, mandocello, mandobass&quot;, or in the case of banjos, &quot;banjolin, banjola, banjo cello, bass banjo&quot;. Because the range of pluck-stringed instrument generally is not as great as that of comparably sized bowed-string instruments, other instruments were often added to these plucked orchestras to extend the range of the ensemble upwards and downwards.

The banjo cello was normally tuned C2-G2-D3-A3, one octave below the tenor banjo like the cello and mandocello. A five-string cello banjo, set up like a bluegrass banjo (with the short fifth string), but tuned one octave lower, has been produced by the Goldtone company.
Bass banjos have been produced in both upright bass formats and with standard, horizontally carried banjo bodies. Contrabass banjos with either three or four strings have also been made; some of these had headstocks similar to those of bass violins. Tuning varies on these large instruments, with four-string models sometimes being tuned in 4ths like a bass violin (E1-A1-D2-G2) and sometimes in 5ths, like a four-string cello banjo, one octave lower (C1-G1-D2-A2).

=== Long neck banjos ===

Also called Seeger banjos for having been invented by Pete Seeger, these banjos feature three extra frets, giving the instrument a longer neck and greater playing versatility. With three extra frets, these banjos can be played one-and-a-half steps lower than a regular banjo, which some players find advantageous for singing or playing along. They are almost always open-backed. Notably, the drone strings on Seeger banjos are not pushed three frets back, so the tuning peg for the 5th string is in line with the 8th fret instead of the 5th fret. 

===Banjo hybrids and variants===
A number of hybrid instruments exist, crossing the banjo with other stringed instruments. Most of these use the body of a banjo, often with a resonator, and the neck of the other instrument. Examples include the banjo mandolin (first patented in 1882) and the banjo ukulele, most famously played by the English comedian George Formby. These were especially popular in the early decades of the 20th century, and were probably a result of a desire either to allow players of other instruments to jump on the banjo bandwagon at the height of its popularity, or to get the natural amplification benefits of the banjo resonator in an age before electric amplification.

Conversely, the tenor and plectrum guitars use the respective banjo necks on guitar bodies. They arose in the early 20th century as a way for banjo players to double on guitar without having to relearn the instrument entirely.

Instruments that have a five-string banjo neck on a wooden body (for example, a guitar, bouzouki, or dobro body) have also been made, such as the banjola. A 20th-century Turkish instrument similar to the banjo is called the &quot;cümbüş&quot;, which combines a banjo-like resonator with a neck derived from an oud. At the end of the 20th century, a development of the five-string banjo was the BanSitar. This features a bone bridge, giving the instrument a sitar-like resonance.

The Brazilian samba banjo is basically a cavaquinho neck on a banjo body, thereby producing a louder sound than the cavaquinho. It is tuned the same as the top 4 strings of a 5-string banjo up an octave (or any cavaquinho tuning).

==Noted banjoists==
* Joel Sweeney (1810–1860), also known as Joe Sweeney, was a musician and early blackface minstrel performer. He is known for popularizing the playing of the banjo and has often been credited with advancing the physical development of the modern five-string banjo.
* Vess Ossman (1868–1923) was a leading five-string banjoist who started playing banjo at age 12. He was a popular recording artist, and in fact one of the first recording artists &quot;ever&quot;, when audio recording first became commercially available. He formed various recording groups, his most popular being the Ossman-Dudley trio.
* Clifford Essex (1869–1946), a British banjoist, who was also a musical instrument manufacturer
* Uncle Dave Macon (1870–1952) was a banjo player and comedian from Tennessee known for his &quot;plug hat, gold teeth, chin whiskers, gates ajar collar and that million dollar Tennessee smile&quot;.
* Fred Van Eps (1878–1960) was a noted five-string player and banjo maker who learned to play from listening to cylinder recordings of Vess Ossman. He recorded for Edison&#x27;s company, producing some of the earliest disk recordings, and also the earliest ragtime recordings in any medium other than player piano.
* Frank Lawes (1894–1970), of the United Kingdom, developed a unique fingerstyle technique on the four-string plectrum instrument, and was a prolific composer of four-string banjo music, much of which is still performed and recorded today.
* Pasquale Troise (1895-1957), Italian emigrant to the UK in the 1920s. Formed Troise and his Banjoliers in 1933, which recorded with Decca and performed regularly on the BBC&#x27;s long-running series Music While You Work. 
* Harry Reser (1896–1965), plectrum and tenor banjo, was regarded by some as the best tenor banjoist of the 1920s. He wrote a large number of works for tenor banjo, as well as instructional material including numerous banjo method books, over a dozen other instrumental method books (for guitar, ukulele, mandolin etc.), and was well known in the banjo community. Reser&#x27;s accomplished single string and &quot;chord melody&quot; technique set a &quot;high mark&quot; that many subsequent tenor players still endeavor to attain.
* Eddie Peabody (1902–1970) was a great proponent of the plectrum banjo who performed for nearly five decades (1920–1968) and left a considerable legacy of recordings. An early reviewer dubbed him &quot;King of the Banjo&quot;, and his was a household name for decades. He went on to develop new instruments, produce records, and appear in movies.
* Ola Belle Reed (1916–2002) was an American folk singer, songwriter and banjo player.
* Pete Seeger (1919–2014), a singer-songwriter who performed solo as well as with folk group the Weavers, included five-string banjo among his instruments. His 1948 method book &quot;How to Play the Five-String Banjo&quot; has been credited by thousands of banjoists, including prominent professionals, with sparking their interest in the instrument. He is also credited with inventing the long-neck banjo (also known as the &quot;Seeger Banjo&quot;), which adds three lower frets to the five-string banjo&#x27;s neck, and tunes the four main strings down by a minor third, to facilitate playing in singing keys more comfortable for some folk guitarists.
* Earl Scruggs (1924–2012), whose career ranged from the end of World War II into the 21st century, is widely regarded as the father of the bluegrass style of banjo playing. The three-finger style of playing he developed while playing with Bill Monroe&#x27;s band is known by his name: &quot;Scruggs Style&quot;.
* Ralph Stanley (1927–2016) had a long career, both with his brother as the Stanley Brothers and with his band the Clinch Mountain Boys. He was awarded an honorary doctorate of music by Lincoln Memorial University, is a member of the Bluegrass Hall of Fame and the Grand Ole Opry. He won a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou?.

Barney used GDAE tuning on a 19-fret tenor banjo, an octave below fiddle/mandolin and, according to musician Mick Moloney, was single-handedly responsible for making the GDAE-tuned tenor banjo the standard banjo in Irish music. Due to his skill level on the banjo, fans all around the world and other members of The Dubliners nicknamed him &quot;Banjo Barney&quot;.

* Other important four-string performers were Mike Pingitore, who played tenor for the Paul Whiteman Orchestra through 1948, and Roy Smeck, early radio and recording pioneer, author of many instructional books, and whose influential performances on many fretted instruments earned him the nickname &quot;Wizard of the Strings&quot;, during his active years (1922–1950). Prominent tenor players of more recent vintage include Narvin Kimball (d. 2006) (left-handed banjoist of Preservation Hall Jazz Band fame).
* Noted four-string players currently active include ragtime and dixieland stylists Charlie Tagawa (1935–2017) and Bill Lowrey (b. 1963).

<doc id="3850" wikidata="Q5369" url="?curid=3850" title="Baseball">
<text>Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding. The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team&#x27;s players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called &quot;runs&quot;. The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners advancing around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).

The initial objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely; this generally occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter&#x27;s reach. Players on the batting team who reach first base without being called &quot;out&quot; can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates&#x27; turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by using the ball to get batters or runners &quot;out&quot;, which forces them out of the field of play. The pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base.

The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team&#x27;s turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. Most games end after the ninth inning, but if scores are tied at that point, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, though some competitions feature pace-of-play regulations such as the pitch clock to shorten game time.

Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. Baseball&#x27;s American origins, as well as its reputation as a source of escapism during troubled points in American history such as the American Civil War and the Great Depression, have led the sport to receive the moniker of &quot;America&#x27;s Pastime&quot;; since the late 19th century, it has been unofficially recognized as the national sport of the United States, though in modern times is considered less popular than other sports, such as American football. In addition to North America, baseball spread throughout the rest of the Americas and the Asia–Pacific in the 19th and 20th centuries, and is now considered the most popular sport in parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.

In Major League Baseball (MLB), the highest level of professional baseball in the United States and Canada, teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The MLB champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League. The World Baseball Classic, organized by the World Baseball Softball Confederation, is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world. Baseball was played at the Olympic Games from 1992 to 2008, and was reinstated on a one-off basis in 2020.

==Rules and gameplay==
=== Overview ===

A baseball game is played between two teams, each usually composed of nine players, that take turns playing offense (batting and baserunning) and defense (pitching and fielding). A pair of turns, one at bat and one in the field, by each team constitutes an inning. A game consists of nine innings (seven innings at the high school level and in doubleheaders in college, Minor League Baseball and, since the 2020 season, Major League Baseball; and six innings at the Little League level). One team—customarily the visiting team—bats in the top, or first half, of every inning. The other team—customarily the home team—bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. 

The goal of the game is to score more points (runs) than the other team. The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by touching all four bases, in order, set at the corners of the square-shaped baseball diamond. A player bats at home plate and must attempt to safely reach a base before proceeding, counterclockwise, from first base, to second base, third base, and back home to score a run. The team in the field attempts to prevent runs from scoring by recording outs, which remove opposing players from offensive action until their next turn at bat comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, extra innings are played to resolve the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings.

The game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield; the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield. In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher&#x27;s mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height. The fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball&#x27;s field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.

There are three basic tools of baseball: the ball, the bat, and the glove or mitt:
* The baseball is about the size of an adult&#x27;s fist, around in circumference. It has a rubber or cork center, wound in yarn and covered in white cowhide, with red stitching.
* The bat is a hitting tool, traditionally made of a single, solid piece of wood. Other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games. It is a hard round stick, about in diameter at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob. Bats used by adults are typically around long, and not longer than .
* The glove or mitt is a fielding tool, made of padded leather with webbing between the fingers. As an aid in catching and holding onto the ball, it takes various shapes to meet the specific needs of different fielding positions.
Protective helmets are also standard equipment for all batters.
=== Fielding positions ===

At the beginning of each half-inning, the nine players of the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher&#x27;s mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another fielding team player, the catcher, squats on the far side of home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the fielding team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered. A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher. Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well.

=== Offense ===

Play starts with a member of the batting team, the batter, standing in either of the two batter&#x27;s boxes next to home plate, holding a bat. The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts to hit the ball with the bat. The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a &quot;runner&quot; (or, until the play is over, a &quot;batter-runner&quot;). 

A batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out is said to be &quot;safe&quot; and is on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single. If a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result of a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or if the batter-runner otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. The ultimate and most desirable result possible for a batter would be to hit a home run while all three bases are occupied or &quot;loaded&quot;, thus scoring four runs on a single hit. This is called a grand slam. A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error.

Any runners already on base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, before or after the ball lands. A runner on first base &quot;must&quot; attempt to advance if a ball lands in play, as only one runner may occupy a base at any given time; the same applies for other runners if they are on a base that a teammate is forced to advance to. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they occupied when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up (contact the base they occupied when the play began, as or after the ball is caught). Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher is in the process of delivering the ball to home plate; a successful effort is a stolen base.

=== Defense ===

A pitch that is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are recorded strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter&#x27;s body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire&#x27;s judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter&#x27;s shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee. Any pitch which does not pass through the strike zone is called a ball, unless the batter either swings and misses at the pitch, or hits the pitch into foul territory; an exception generally occurs if the ball is hit into foul territory when the batter already has two strikes, in which case neither a ball nor a strike is called.
While the team at bat is trying to score runs, the team in the field is attempting to record outs. In addition to the strikeout and flyout, common ways a member of the batting team may be put out include the ground out, force out, and tag out. These occur either when a runner is forced to advance to a base, and a fielder with possession of the ball reaches that base before the runner does, or the runner is touched by the ball, held in a fielder&#x27;s hand, while not on a base. (The batter-runner is always forced to advance to first base, and any other runners must advance to the next base if a teammate is forced to advance to their base.) It is possible to record two outs in the course of the same play. This is called a double play. Three outs in one play, a triple play, is possible, though rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team&#x27;s dugout or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty.

=== Batting order and substitution ===

An individual player&#x27;s turn batting or plate appearance is complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball that results in the team&#x27;s third out, even if it is recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter&#x27;s hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team&#x27;s next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased.

A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player&#x27;s team have all taken their turn at bat in the batting order. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children&#x27;s games often have more lenient rules, such as Little League rules, which allow players to be substituted back into the same game.

If the designated hitter (DH) rule is in effect, each team has a tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and run). The DH takes the place of another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.

== Personnel ==
=== Players ===
The number of players on a baseball roster, or &quot;squad&quot;, varies by league and by the level of organized play. A Major League Baseball (MLB) team has a roster of 26 players with specific roles. A typical roster features the following players:
* Eight position players: the catcher, four infielders, and three outfielders—all of whom play on a regular basis
* Five starting pitchers who constitute the team&#x27;s pitching rotation or starting rotation
* Seven relief pitchers, including one closer, who constitute the team&#x27;s bullpen (named for the off-field area where pitchers warm up)
* One backup, or substitute, catcher
* Five backup infielders and backup outfielders, or players who can play multiple positions, known as utility players.

Most baseball leagues worldwide have the DH rule, including MLB, Japan&#x27;s Pacific League, and Caribbean professional leagues, along with major American amateur organizations. The Central League in Japan does not have the rule and high-level minor league clubs connected to National League teams are not required to field a DH. In leagues that apply the designated hitter rule, a typical team has nine offensive regulars (including the DH), five starting pitchers, seven or eight relievers, a backup catcher, and two or three other reserve players.

=== Managers and coaches ===
The manager, or head coach, oversees the team&#x27;s major strategic decisions, such as establishing the starting rotation, setting the lineup, or batting order, before each game, and making substitutions during games—in particular, bringing in relief pitchers. Managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches; they may have specialized responsibilities, such as working with players on hitting, fielding, pitching, or strength and conditioning. At most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat: the first base coach and third base coach, who occupy designated coaches&#x27; boxes, just outside the foul lines. These coaches assist in the direction of baserunners, when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners, during pauses in play. In contrast to many other team sports, baseball managers and coaches generally wear their team&#x27;s uniforms; coaches must be in uniform to be allowed on the field to confer with players during a game.

=== Umpires ===
Any baseball game involves one or more umpires, who make rulings on the outcome of each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of the strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In MLB, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.

== Strategy ==
Many of the pre-game and in-game strategic decisions in baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters tend to be more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters tend to be more successful against right-handed pitchers. A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup, who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher, may respond by starting one or more of the right-handed backups on the team&#x27;s roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions. The manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups and the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder (known as a defensive substitution).

==Tactics==
=== Pitching and fielding ===


The tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter, thus creating differing pitches that can be selected. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, as well as its general vertical or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch.

With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner&#x27;s lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher&#x27;s movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, which permits any runners on base to advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to one side of the field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.

=== Batting and baserunning ===

Several basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed, with a skillful contact hitter, the runner takes off with the pitch, drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating a gap in the infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt, calls for the batter to focus on making soft contact with the ball, so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position as the batter is thrown out at first. A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit. A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. In order to increase the chance of advancing a batter to first base via a walk, the manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch. The batter&#x27;s potential reward of reaching base (via a walk) exceeds the disadvantage if the next pitch is a strike.

== History ==

The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. Consensus once held that today&#x27;s baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular among children in Great Britain and Ireland. American baseball historian David Block suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. According to Block and John Thorn, official MLB historian, this earlier version of baseball may have involved hitting the ball with a hand, making it akin to today&#x27;s punchball. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game&#x27;s most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and &quot;tut-ball&quot;. The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, &quot;A Little Pretty Pocket-Book&quot;, by John Newbery. Block discovered that the first recorded game of &quot;Bass-Ball&quot; took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player. This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants.

By the early 1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early forms of baseball being played around North America. The first officially recorded baseball game in North America was played in Beachville, Ontario, Canada, on June 4, 1838. In 1845, Alexander Cartwright, a member of New York City&#x27;s Knickerbocker Club, led the codification of the so-called Knickerbocker Rules, which in turn were based on rules developed in 1837 by William R. Wheaton of the Gotham Club. While there are reports that the New York Knickerbockers played games in 1845, the contest long recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in U.S. history took place on June 19, 1846, in Hoboken, New Jersey: the &quot;New York Nine&quot; defeated the Knickerbockers, 23–1, in four innings. With the Knickerbocker code as the basis, the rules of modern baseball continued to evolve over the next half-century. The game then went on to spread throughout the Pacific Rim and the Americas, with Americans backing the sport as a way to spread American values.

=== In the United States ===
==== Establishment of professional leagues ====
In the mid-1850s, a baseball craze hit the New York metropolitan area, and by 1856, local journals were referring to baseball as the &quot;national pastime&quot; or &quot;national game&quot;. A year later, the sport&#x27;s first governing body, the National Association of Base Ball Players, was formed. In 1867, it barred participation by African Americans. The more formally structured National League was founded in 1876. Professional Negro leagues formed, but quickly folded. In 1887, softball, under the name of indoor baseball or indoor-outdoor, was invented as a winter version of the parent game. The National League&#x27;s first successful counterpart, the American League, which evolved from the minor Western League, was established in 1893, and virtually all of the modern baseball rules were in place by then.

The National Agreement of 1903 formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country&#x27;s minor professional leagues. The World Series, pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall. The Black Sox Scandal of the 1919 World Series led to the formation of the office of the Commissioner of Baseball. The first commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the Negro National League; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the Eastern Colored League.

==== Rise of Ruth and racial integration ====

Compared with the present, professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower-scoring, and pitchers were more dominant. This so-called &quot;dead-ball era&quot; ended in the early 1920s with several changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters. Strict new regulations governed the ball&#x27;s size, shape and composition, along with a new rule officially banning the spitball and other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed-up with foreign substances, resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit. The rise of the legendary player Babe Ruth, the first great power hitter of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of the game. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, St. Louis Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey invested in several minor league clubs and developed the first modern farm system. A new Negro National League was organized in 1933; four years later, it was joined by the Negro American League. The first elections to the National Baseball Hall of Fame took place in 1936. In 1939, Little League Baseball was founded in Pennsylvania.

Many minor league teams disbanded when World War II led to a player shortage. Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley led the formation of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League to help keep the game in the public eye. The first crack in the unwritten agreement barring blacks from white-controlled professional ball occurred in 1945: Jackie Robinson was signed by the National League&#x27;s Brooklyn Dodgers and began playing for their minor league team in Montreal. In 1947, Robinson broke the major leagues&#x27; color barrier when he debuted with the Dodgers. Latin-American players, largely overlooked before, also started entering the majors in greater numbers. In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born Chico Carrasquel and black Cuban-born Minnie Miñoso, became the first Hispanic All-Stars. Integration proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the 16 major league teams had a black player on the roster.

==== Attendance records and the age of steroids ====

In 1975, the union&#x27;s power—and players&#x27; salaries—began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was effectively struck down, leading to the free agency system. Significant work stoppages occurred in 1981 and 1994, the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years. Attendance had been growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance. After play resumed in 1995, non-division-winning wild card teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season. Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set. In 2000, the National and American Leagues were dissolved as legal entities. While their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions—such as player discipline and umpire supervision—they had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of MLB.

In 2001, Barry Bonds established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season. There had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by the abuse of illegal steroids (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion), but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing drugs before 2004. In 2007, Bonds became MLB&#x27;s all-time home run leader, surpassing Hank Aaron, as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs.

=== Around the world ===

Despite having been called &quot;America&#x27;s national pastime&quot;, baseball is well-established in several other countries. As early as 1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both Canada and the United States. While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League.
In 1847, American soldiers played what may have been the first baseball game in Mexico at Parque Los Berros in Xalapa, Veracruz. The first formal baseball league outside of the United States and Canada was founded in 1878 in Cuba, which maintains a rich baseball tradition. The Dominican Republic held its first islandwide championship tournament in 1912. Professional baseball tournaments and leagues began to form in other countries between the world wars, including the Netherlands (formed in 1922), Australia (1934), Japan (1936), Mexico (1937), and Puerto Rico (1938). The Japanese major leagues have long been considered the highest quality professional circuits outside of the United States.

After World War II, professional leagues were founded in many Latin American countries, most prominently Venezuela (1946) and the Dominican Republic (1955). Since the early 1970s, the annual Caribbean Series has matched the championship clubs from the four leading Latin American winter leagues: the Dominican Professional Baseball League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League, and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. In Asia, South Korea (1982), Taiwan (1990) and China (2003) all have professional leagues.

The English football club, Aston Villa, were the first British baseball champions winning the 1890 National League of Baseball of Great Britain. The 2020 National Champions were the London Mets. Other European countries have seen professional leagues; the most successful, other than the Dutch league, is the Italian league, founded in 1948. In 2004, Australia won a surprise silver medal at the Olympic Games. The Confédération Européene de Baseball (European Baseball Confederation), founded in 1953, organizes a number of competitions between clubs from different countries. Other competitions between national teams, such as the Baseball World Cup and the Olympic baseball tournament, were administered by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) from its formation in 1938 until its 2013 merger with the International Softball Federation to create the current joint governing body for both sports, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC). Women&#x27;s baseball is played on an organized amateur basis in numerous countries.

After being admitted to the Olympics as a medal sport beginning with the 1992 Games, baseball was dropped from the 2012 Summer Olympic Games at the 2005 International Olympic Committee meeting. It remained part of the 2008 Games. While the sport&#x27;s lack of a following in much of the world was a factor, more important was MLB&#x27;s reluctance to allow its players to participate during the major league season. MLB initiated the World Baseball Classic, scheduled to precede its season, partly as a replacement, high-profile international tournament. The inaugural Classic, held in March 2006, was the first tournament involving national teams to feature a significant number of MLB participants. The Baseball World Cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic.

== Distinctive elements ==
Baseball has certain attributes that set it apart from the other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock, play is less individual, and the variation between playing fields is not as substantial or important. The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball&#x27;s distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.

=== No clock to kill ===

In clock-limited sports, games often end with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than competing aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock, thus a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. Whereas, in the case of multi-day Test and first-class cricket, the possibility of a draw (which occurs because of the restrictions on time, which like in baseball, originally did not exist) often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind, to bat defensively and run out the clock, giving up any faint chance at a win, to avoid an overall loss.

While nine innings has been the standard since the beginning of professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years. At the turn of the 20th century, games typically took an hour and a half to play. In the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960. By 1997, the average American League game lasted 2:57 (National League games were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters). In 2004, Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of 2:45. By 2014, though, the average MLB game took over three hours to complete. The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play, with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters stepping out of the box more frequently. Other leagues have experienced similar issues. In 2008, Nippon Professional Baseball took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade&#x27;s average of 3:18.

In 2016, the average nine-inning playoff game in Major League baseball was 3 hours and 35 minutes. This was up 10 minutes from 2015 and 21 minutes from 2014. In response to the lengthening of the game, MLB decided from the 2023 season onward to institute a pitch clock rule to penalize batters and pitchers who take too much time between pitches; this had the effect of shortening 2023 regular season games by 24 minutes on average.

=== Individual focus ===

Although baseball is a team sport, individual players are often placed under scrutiny and pressure. While rewarding, it has sometimes been described as &quot;ruthless&quot; due to the pressure on the individual player. In 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: &quot;the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits&quot;. Pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other. While coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. If the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. The statistical precision of baseball is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it.

Cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.

=== Uniqueness of parks ===

Unlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams, following the rules of MLB and Minor League Baseball, is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of from home plate to the fences in left and right field and to center. Major league teams often skirt even this rule. For example, at Daikin Park, which became the home of the Houston Astros in 2000, the Crawford Boxes in left field are only from home plate. There are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield. The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park, in use since 1912: the Green Monster is from home plate down the line and tall.

Similarly, there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground. A fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run. The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare. Some fields—including several in MLB—use artificial turf. Surface variations can have a significant effect on how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played. While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.

These physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher&#x27;s park or a hitter&#x27;s park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park in this regard is Coors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies. Its high altitude— above sea level—is partly responsible for giving it the strongest hitter&#x27;s park effect in the major leagues due to the low air pressure. Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a pitcher&#x27;s park when the strong winds off Lake Michigan are blowing in, it becomes more of a hitter&#x27;s park when they are blowing out. The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players&#x27; statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball into right field might result in an easy catch on the warning track at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the New York Yankees, will tend to stock its roster with left-handed pull hitters, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter&#x27;s park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time—even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.

== Statistics ==
Organized baseball lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports. Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. In the late 19th century, a former cricket player, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, was responsible for the &quot;development of the box score, tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the batting average, and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball.&quot; The statistical record is so central to the game&#x27;s &quot;historical essence&quot; that Chadwick came to be known as Father Baseball. In the 1920s, American newspapers began devoting more and more attention to baseball statistics, initiating what journalist and historian Alan Schwarz describes as a &quot;tectonic shift in sports, as intrigue that once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their statistics lines.&quot;

The Official Baseball Rules administered by MLB require the official scorer to categorize each baseball play unambiguously. The rules provide detailed criteria to promote consistency. The score report is the official basis for both the box score of the game and the relevant statistical records. General managers, managers, and baseball scouts use statistics to evaluate players and make strategic decisions.
Certain traditional statistics are familiar to most baseball fans. The basic batting statistics include:
* At bats: plate appearances, excluding walks and hit by pitches—where the batter&#x27;s ability is not fully tested—and sacrifices and sacrifice flies—where the batter intentionally makes an out in order to advance one or more baserunners
* Hits: times a base is reached safely, because of a batted, fair ball without a fielding error or fielder&#x27;s choice
* Runs: times circling the bases and reaching home safely
* Runs batted in (RBIs): number of runners who scored due to a batter&#x27;s action (including the batter, in the case of a home run), except when batter grounded into double play or reached on an error
* Home runs: hits on which the batter successfully touched all four bases, without the contribution of a fielding error
* Batting average: hits divided by at bats—the traditional measure of batting ability
The basic baserunning statistics include:
* Stolen bases: times advancing to the next base entirely due to the runner&#x27;s own efforts, generally while the pitcher is preparing to deliver or delivering the ball
* Caught stealing: times tagged out while attempting to steal a base

The basic pitching statistics include:
* Wins: credited to pitcher on winning team who last pitched before the team took a lead that it never relinquished (a starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings to qualify for a win)
* Losses: charged to pitcher on losing team who was pitching when the opposing team took a lead that it never relinquished
* Saves: games where the pitcher enters a game led by the pitcher&#x27;s team, finishes the game without surrendering the lead, is not the winning pitcher, and either (a) the lead was three runs or less when the pitcher entered the game; (b) the potential tying run was on base, at bat, or on deck; or (c) the pitcher pitched three or more innings
* Innings pitched: outs recorded while pitching divided by three (partial innings are conventionally recorded as, e.g., &quot;5.2&quot; or &quot;7.1&quot;, the last digit actually representing thirds, not tenths, of an inning)
* Strikeouts: times pitching three strikes to a batter
* Winning percentage: wins divided by decisions (wins plus losses)
* Earned run average (ERA): runs allowed, excluding those resulting from fielding errors, per nine innings pitched
The basic fielding statistics include:
* Putouts: times the fielder catches a fly ball, tags or forces out a runner, or otherwise directly effects an out
* Assists: times a putout by another fielder was recorded following the fielder touching the ball
* Errors: times the fielder fails to make a play that should have been made with common effort, and the batting team benefits as a result
* Total chances: putouts plus assists plus errors
* Fielding average: successful chances (putouts plus assists) divided by total chances

Among the many other statistics that are kept are those collectively known as &quot;situational statistics&quot;. For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against. If a given situation statistically favors a certain batter, the manager of the fielding team may be more likely to change pitchers or have the pitcher intentionally walk the batter in order to face one who is less likely to succeed.

=== Sabermetrics ===
Sabermetrics is the field of baseball statistical study and the development of new statistics and analytical tools. Such new statistics are also called sabermetrics. The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field&#x27;s leading proponents, Bill James, and derives from the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR).

The growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batter&#x27;s skill than batting average:
* On-base percentage (OBP) measures a batter&#x27;s ability to get on base. It is calculated by taking the sum of the batter&#x27;s successes in getting on base (hits plus walks plus hit by pitches) and dividing that by the batter&#x27;s total plate appearances (at bats plus walks plus hit by pitches plus sacrifice flies), except for sacrifice bunts.
* Slugging percentage (SLG) measures a batter&#x27;s ability to hit for power. It is calculated by taking the batter&#x27;s total bases (one per each single, two per double, three per triple, and four per home run) and dividing that by the batter&#x27;s at bats.

Some of the new statistics devised by sabermetricians have gained wide use:
* On-base plus slugging (OPS) measures a batter&#x27;s overall ability. It is calculated by adding the batter&#x27;s on-base percentage and slugging percentage.
* Walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) measures a pitcher&#x27;s ability at preventing hitters from reaching base. It is calculated by adding the number of walks and hits a pitcher surrendered, then dividing by the number of innings pitched.
*Wins Above Replacement (WAR) measures number of additional wins his team has achieved above the number of expected team wins if that player were substituted with a replacement-level player.

== Popularity and cultural impact ==

Writing in 1919, philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen described baseball as the national religion of the US. In the words of sports columnist Jayson Stark, baseball has long been &quot;a unique paragon of American culture&quot;—a status he sees as devastated by the steroid abuse scandal. Baseball has an important place in other national cultures as well: Scholar Peter Bjarkman describes &quot;how deeply the sport is ingrained in the history and culture of a nation such as Cuba, [and] how thoroughly it was radically reshaped and nativized in Japan.&quot;

=== Western Hemisphere ===
American influence in the Western Hemisphere has meant that baseball grew significantly in the region.

==== In the United States ====

The major league game in the United States was originally targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the National League&#x27;s set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience. A century later, the situation was very different. With the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices—football, basketball, and hockey—professional baseball had become among the most popular blue-collar-oriented American spectator sports. 
Overall, baseball has a large following in the United States; a 2006 poll found that nearly half of Americans are fans. This led to baseball being granted the title of &quot;America&#x27;s favorite pastime&quot; by many American baseball fans. The game was historically seen as contributing to the melting pot society of the nation, encouraging immigrants to integrate. In the late 1900s and early 2000s, baseball&#x27;s position compared to football in the United States moved in contradictory directions. In 2008, MLB set a revenue record of $6.5 billion, matching the NFL&#x27;s revenue for the first time in decades. A new MLB revenue record of more than $10 billion was set in 2017. On the other hand, the percentage of American sports fans polled who named baseball as their favorite sport was 9%, compared to pro football at 37%. In 1985, the respective figures were pro football 24%, baseball 23%. Because there are so many more major league games played, there is no comparison in overall attendance. In 2008, total attendance at major league games was the second-highest in history: 78.6 million, 0.7% off the record set the previous year. The following year, amid the U.S. recession, attendance fell by 6.6% to 73.4 million. Eight years later, it dropped under 73 million. Attendance at games held under the Minor League Baseball umbrella set a record in 2008, with 43.3 million. While MLB games have not drawn the same national TV viewership as football games, MLB games are dominant in teams&#x27; local markets and regularly lead all programs in primetime in their markets during the summer.

==== Latin America ====

Baseball is very popular in Venezuela; in 2011, 95% of people surveyed claimed it to be the national sport. The sport&#x27;s overall popularity in Latin America has assisted in integrating Latin American migrants to the United States.

In Brazil, baseball fan popularity has grown in last few years, thanks to MLB broadcasts in Brazilian ESPN and the historic silver medal in 2023 Pan-American games. although, it still lags behind Basketball and American Football in the list of most played sports in Brazil.

==== Caribbean ====
Since the early 1980s, the Dominican Republic, in particular the city of San Pedro de Macorís, has been the major leagues&#x27; primary source of foreign talent. In 2017, 83 of the 868 players on MLB Opening Day rosters (and disabled lists) were from the country. Among other Caribbean countries and territories, a combined 97 MLB players were born in Venezuela, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. Hall-of-Famer Roberto Clemente remains one of the greatest national heroes in Puerto Rico&#x27;s history. While baseball has long been the island&#x27;s primary athletic pastime, its once well-attended professional winter league has declined in popularity since 1990, when young Puerto Rican players began to be included in the major leagues&#x27; annual first-year player draft. In Cuba, where baseball is by every reckoning the national sport, the national team overshadows the city and provincial teams that play in the top-level domestic leagues.

=== Asia ===

In East Asia, baseball is among the most popular sports in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. In Japan, where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator team sport, combined revenue for the twelve teams in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the body that oversees both the Central and Pacific Leagues, was estimated at $1 billion in 2007. Total NPB attendance for the year was approximately 20 million. While in the preceding two decades, MLB attendance grew by 50 percent and revenue nearly tripled, the comparable NPB figures were stagnant. There are concerns that MLB&#x27;s growing interest in acquiring star Japanese players will hurt the game in their home country. Revenue figures are not released for the country&#x27;s amateur system. Similarly, according to one official pronouncement, the sport&#x27;s governing authority &quot;has never taken into account attendance ... because its greatest interest has always been the development of athletes&quot;. In Taiwan, baseball is one of the most widely spectated sports, in tv and person.

Baseball has grown significantly in China in recent years, with MLB estimating in 2019 that there are 21 million active fans in the country.

=== Among children ===
, Little League Baseball oversees leagues with close to 2.4 million participants in over 80 countries. The number of players has fallen since the 1990s, when 3 million children took part in Little League Baseball annually. Babe Ruth League teams have over 1 million participants. According to the president of the International Baseball Federation, between 300,000 and 500,000 women and girls play baseball around the world, including Little League and the introductory game of Tee Ball.

A varsity baseball team is an established part of physical education departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States. In 2015, nearly half a million high schoolers and over 34,000 collegians played on their schools&#x27; baseball teams. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan&#x27;s leading sport. Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at age six. Talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.

=== In popular culture ===
Baseball has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the United States and elsewhere. Dozens of English-language idioms have been derived from baseball; in particular, the game is the source of a number of widely used sexual euphemisms. The first networked radio broadcasts in North America were of the 1922 World Series: famed sportswriter Grantland Rice announced play-by-play from New York City&#x27;s Polo Grounds on WJZ–Newark, New Jersey, which was connected by wire to WGY–Schenectady, New York, and WBZ–Springfield, Massachusetts. The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.

Baseball has inspired many works of art and entertainment. One of the first major examples, Ernest Thayer&#x27;s poem &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot;, appeared in 1888. A wry description of the failure of a star player in what would now be called a &quot;clutch situation&quot;, the poem became the source of vaudeville and other staged performances, audio recordings, film adaptations, and an opera, as well as a host of sequels and parodies in various media. There have been many baseball movies, including the Academy Award–winning &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot; (1942) and the Oscar nominees &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984) and &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; (1989). The American Film Institute&#x27;s selection of the ten best sports movies includes &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot; at number 3 and &quot;Bull Durham&quot; (1988) at number 5. Baseball has provided thematic material for hits on both stage—the Adler–Ross musical &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;—and record—George J. Gaskin&#x27;s &quot;Slide, Kelly, Slide&quot;, Simon and Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;, and John Fogerty&#x27;s &quot;Centerfield&quot;. The baseball-inspired comedic sketch &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot;, popularized by Abbott and Costello in 1938, quickly became famous. Six decades later, &quot;Time&quot; named it the best comedy routine of the 20th century.

Literary works connected to the game include the short fiction of Ring Lardner and novels such as Bernard Malamud&#x27;s &quot;The Natural&quot; (the source for the movie), Robert Coover&#x27;s &quot;The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop.&quot;, John Grisham&#x27;s Calico Joe and W. P. Kinsella&#x27;s &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; (the source for &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;). Baseball&#x27;s literary canon also includes the beat reportage of Damon Runyon; the columns of Grantland Rice, Red Smith, Dick Young, and Peter Gammons; and the essays of Roger Angell. Among the celebrated nonfiction books in the field are Lawrence S. Ritter&#x27;s &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;, Roger Kahn&#x27;s &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;, and Michael Lewis&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. The 1970 publication of major league pitcher Jim Bouton&#x27;s tell-all chronicle &quot;Ball Four&quot; is considered a turning point in the reporting of professional sports.

Baseball has also inspired the creation of new cultural forms. Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example featured an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.

Modern fantasy sports began in 1980 with the invention of Rotisserie League Baseball by New York writer Daniel Okrent and several friends. Participants in a Rotisserie league draft notional teams from the list of active MLB players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based on the players&#x27; latest real-world statistics. Rotisserie-style play quickly became a phenomenon. Now known more generically as fantasy baseball, it has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports. The field boomed with increasing Internet access and new fantasy sports-related websites. By 2008, 29.9 million people in the United States and Canada were playing fantasy sports, spending $800 million on the hobby. The burgeoning popularity of fantasy baseball is also credited with the increasing attention paid to sabermetrics—first among fans, only later among baseball professionals.

=== Derivative games ===
Informal variations of baseball have popped up over time, with games like corkball reflecting local traditions and allowing the game to be played in diverse environments. Two variations of baseball, softball and Baseball5, are internationally governed alongside baseball by the World Baseball Softball Confederation.

==== British baseball ====

American professional baseball teams toured Britain in 1874 and 1889, and had a great effect on similar sports in Britain. In Wales and Merseyside, a strong community game had already developed with skills and plays more in keeping with the American game and the Welsh began to informally adopt the name &quot;baseball&quot; (Pêl Fas), to reflect the American style. By the 1890s, calls were made to follow the success of other working class sports (like Rugby in Wales and Soccer in Merseyside) and adopt a distinct set of rules and bureaucracy. During the 1892 season rules for the game of &quot;baseball&quot; were agreed and the game was officially codified.

==== Finnish baseball ====

Finnish baseball, also known as pesäpallo, is a combination of traditional ball-batting team games and North American baseball, invented by Lauri &quot;Tahko&quot; Pihkala in the 1920s. The basic idea of pesäpallo is similar to that of baseball: the offense tries to score by hitting the ball successfully and running through the bases, while the defense tries to put the batter and runners out. One of the most important differences between pesäpallo and baseball is that the ball is pitched vertically, which makes hitting the ball, as well as controlling the power and direction of the hit, much easier. This gives the offensive game more variety, speed, and tactical aspects compared to baseball.

<text>In the sport of baseball, each of the nine players on a team is assigned a particular fielding position when it is their turn to play defense. Each position conventionally has an associated number, for use in scorekeeping by the official scorer: 1 (pitcher), 2 (catcher), 3 (first baseman), 4 (second baseman), 5 (third baseman), 6 (shortstop), 7 (left fielder), 8 (center fielder), and 9 (right fielder). Collectively, these positions are usually grouped into three groups: the outfield (left field, center field, and right field), the infield (first base, second base, third base, and shortstop), and the battery (pitcher and catcher). Traditionally, players within each group will often be more able to exchange positions easily (that is, a second baseman can usually play shortstop well, and a center fielder can also be expected to play right field); however, the pitcher and catcher are highly specialized positions and rarely will play at other positions.

== Fielding ==
Fielders must be able to catch the ball well, as catching batted balls before they bounce is one way they can put the batter out, as well as create opportunities to prevent the advance of, and put out other runners. Additionally, they must be able to throw the ball well, with many plays in the game depending on one fielder collecting the hit ball and then throwing it to another fielder who, while holding the ball in their hand/glove, touches either a runner or the base the runner is forced to run to in order to record an out. Fielders often have to run, dive, and slide a great deal in the act of reaching, stopping, and retrieving a hit ball, and then setting themselves up to transfer the ball, all with the end goal of getting the ball as quickly as possible to another fielder. They also run the risk of colliding with incoming runners during a tag attempt at a base. 

Fielders may have different responsibilities depending on the game situation. For example, when an outfielder is attempting to throw the ball from near the fence to one of the bases, an infielder may need to &quot;cut off&quot; the throw and then act as a relay thrower to help the ball cover its remaining distance to the target destination. 

As a group, the outfielders are responsible for preventing home runs by reaching over the fence (and potentially doing a wall climb) for fly balls that are catchable. The infielders are the ones who generally handle plays that involve tagging a base or runner, and also need quick reflexes in order to catch a batted ball before it leaves the infield. The pitcher and catcher have special responsibilities to prevent base stealing, as they are the ones who handle the ball whenever it has not been hit. The catcher will also sometimes attempt to block the plate in order to prevent a run being scored.
